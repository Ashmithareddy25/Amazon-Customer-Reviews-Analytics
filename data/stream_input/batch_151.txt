0060987464|5.0|This book was extremely well written!  It's a summery of his life, from his young years attending a Christian school, until the release of Anti-Christ Superstar, and although graphic at times, the scene's are a part of his life, and it wouldn't be him without them.  Even if you think Manson is dirty, and wrong in his belifs, this book will entirely change your mind.  It is definatly a book that's worth investing in!
0385474547|3.0|After reading Things Fall Apart for my english class, I can't really say that I've learned that much about imperialism.(which is what I think this book is about)<br />The book is extremely simple and easy to understand. It is not like a Skakespearean play or anything. I'd think the most important point in the book was to figure out how &quot;things fell apart.&quot; I'm pretty sure my anchor assessment is on that, and that's what I'm studying most on, and trying to get examples and quotes. For a book in english class, it isn't so bad. But I can't say that the book taught me that much about the British coming to Africa to take over land and stuff. This book's ok if you just use it for a bit of leisure reading or bathroom reading. <br />Don't expect this to be a real educational experience, though. You'll hurt your head trying to figure out all the proverbs and symbolism. NHS rules!
B00004YKUY|5.0|Pure &quot;Rock'n Roll&quot;. Who is this guy Steve Perry, He's really changed this name &quot;right&quot;. Maybe the IRS is after him. Never own a Journey cd/tape, before, my daughter has ever record the band made in the 80 &amp; 90's. The lead gultar's and drumer send you into cyber space. I must have been an sleep  at the wheel, &quot;O&quot; well that's over now, even though I did listen to some of their cuts and Steve Perry was at the top of his form. This whole band sizzle's with life and energy that &quot;blew my mind&quot; ( which  really means cool for you 20 &amp; 30's ( group X generation ). It is time further out. I hope you dig it as much as I do, there I go again giving away my age. Check it out! Go for it.<br />Peace,boogie,and enteral love.
B00000I41G|5.0|A friend said that this was the best blues that he ever heard,  He didn't tell me that this was the best jazz guitar player playig perfect blues in his own voice.  I was so impressed with this CD. Mule is a just great.  Soul lament is a jazz song filled with blues riffs that is the perfect marriage of blues and jazz.  Chitlins con carne was about as good as SRV verision but clean and crisp.  This is like listening to Joe pass but with great incorperation for the blues.  Midnight blues is like cocktails at Sulivans at chicago with a five piece band. Most of the songs are burrell covers.  I have spent years in the blues bars and jazz clubs of chicago And I would love to see this live.  As well the drums and sax are tight and the congo (not a ton of it) give the record a good feel.  Kenny is a must!!!!!!
B000002TWN|4.0|A wonderful fusion of old and new in this smooth blend of 70's soul with 90's R&amp;B.<br />Really great album to listen to when you just want something to chill out to. Deep, rich, soul beats.
630575067X|2.0|As hard as I try I still have issues with this film.I have eagerly awaited this film since George Lucas first anounced his plan for the Star Wars saga way back in 1977. I was 17 at the time and still in high school.I am now 41 years old and none of the films that I have seen to date can compare to seeing the original Star Wars films at the Lowes Astor Plaza on Broadway here in New York for the first,or 21st time. Needless to say, The Phantom Menace is not the film that I waited 20+ years to see. Although I enjoyed the film in the theatre it did not hold up to repeated viewings.     In all fairness I must say that the film is a technical masterpiece. Yes ILM did break new ground with the computer graphics. Yes the film is beautiful to watch. George Lucas however,somehow,somewhere,seemed to forget that special effects do not make the film. All the razzle dazzle in the world is useless if the characters; who are supposed to be the driving force of the film are not fully realized,and badly acted. It is evident that Mr. Lucas was so engrossed in the special effects aspect of the film that he paid little or no attention to script and characters. I found the acting to be flat and emotionless. Qui-Gon and Obi-wan walk through much of the film in a coma. I felt nothing for these characters whatsoever,considering the acting credentials of these two performers. Jar Jar binks is one of the most unlikeable characters I have ever seen on film. Being an african american I cannot help but notice the racial stereotype used for Jar Jar, although George has denied it. Natalie Portman turned in a good performance as Queen Amidala but I found it difficult at times to know who was the real queen and who was the decoy through all that heavy makeup. In regards to little Anakin it was evident that Mr. Lucas cast this child for his looks and not for any real acting talent. I understand that the purpose of the film was to establish the background of the new characters but I still feel that the film suffers greatly because of a lack of a central villan. The one great character created by Lucas in years was Darth Maul. We needed to see more of this guy. I was greatly disappointed that the character recieved so little screen time, not enough dialog, and a serious upstaging by Obi-wan. The character deserved better. Compared to the other films, The Phantom Menace goes to the end of the line behind The Return Of The Jedi; my least favorite of the Star Wars films until now. I think that George Lucas needs to return to basics. Maybe he should invite Steven Speilberg, and James Cameron over for lunch and take notes. All things aside it still is Star Wars and well worth seeing. I am looking forward to seeing how the characters develop in the second film.  PS: If George Lucas ever gets to read this, Midi chlorians?!!!!
B00005221L|5.0|Having been a fan of this movie since it came out, I was a bit apprehensive with some of the reviews I read about the early DVD version which seemed to indicate less than satisfactory audio and video qualities. I was delighted to find a DTS version (I assume recently released) and even more delighted to find that this DTS DVD of the Predator fulfilled all my expectations: a very involving soundfield, sharp crisp picture and color. I'm not going to get into a synopsis of the movie or wax enthusistic about one of Arnold's better films, I'll simply say this is the version that fan's of Predator will want to own.
B0000563FW|4.0|Hello, I just bougth this cd for 2 songs: I'm not scared and Will You remember.<br />I like very much 8th wonder sound, I think it is a good example of old but good sound for disco but not too much 'unz 'unz, they have melody, rothm and a sweet voice, courtesy of Patsy Kensit.<br />If you like old but good pop/disoc music buy it now.
B0000024TQ|5.0|I first heard this album (I guess I am dating myself) when I was in high school and instantly fell in love with the music.  I had been a Simon and Garfunkle fan for years but had never heard this recording before.  Every track is wonderful, especially the arc of &quot;Voices of Old People&quot;, &quot;Old Friends&quot; and &quot;Bookends&quot;.  Those three pieces fit perfectly together, as if it were one long piece.  How can anyone listen to those three pieces and not be blown away.  Many people feel that &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; is Simon and Garfunkle's masterpiece, but I feel without a doubt that &quot;Bookends&quot; is their masterpiece.
B000001FTH|4.0|An album which closes off her Island Records chapter. This album shows the extreme change in music styles from her debut Disco album PORTFOLIO, 1977 through to her new age album SLAVE TO THE RHYTHM, 1985. Although Grace Jones wasn't exactly a money racker for her record companies or a chart topper, this compilation proves that each of her albums has at least one memorable smash hit.  Tracks on this album include the original 12&quot; version of La Vie En Rose, and &quot;radio edited&quot; versions of I Need A Man, Do or Die and Pull Up To The Bumper. I think one of the smarter moves was placing the &quot;Thorngren Remix&quot; of Love Is The Drug (which is not noticeable or credited in the liner notes) on this compilation, the reason being is that in my opinion, I believe the cover version which appeared on the Warm Leatherette, 1980 album sounds too much like the original Roxy Music version.  The Best of Grace Jones can be found all on one cd admittedly, though this truely is a blessing to those who admire Grace Jones, but not enough to collect all of her albums for each hit she produced.
B00005B1EX|5.0|After hearing Halford's debut album and seeing them twice on tour, I was looking forward to the new live release.  Halford sounds better live than in the studio. They have elevated their skillful playing with astounding vocals by Rob Halford, great duo guitar riffs, and excellent drumming.       The two cd set is a must buy for all metal fans.  I think this will perhaps be a yardstick to measure future live albums.  There is nothing amateurish in production about the album.  If you have doubts that Rob Halford can no longer hit high notes, listen to tracks such as &quot;Silent Screams&quot;, &quot;Hell's Last Survivor&quot;, &quot;Sad Wings&quot;, and &quot;Screaming in the Dark&quot;.  Be prepared to be stunned by the intensity of Live--Insurrection!
0380973634|3.0|I liked this book, and I love the alternate reality/universe/world storyline. I just wish someone else had written the book. Stephen King, Connie Willis, Caleb Carr or anyone else who could write more descriptively.<br />I was hoping for a book like the Talisman, by Stephen King, and ended up being disappointed.<br />If you like fantasy books, I am sure you will like this one. If you want a book dripping with ambience, atmosphere and writing aimed at adults, this book is not for you.
6305807086|5.0|I must protest the editorial review that stated, &quot;Does it add up to much? Not really.&quot; The writer of this review needs to take another look.     At first glance many things may seem like random nonsense such as the low cielings and all the animals and the &quot;Malcovich Malcovich&quot; scene. But if you look again you will see that these and many many other things are symbolic and many have reference to other parts of the film and to deeper meanings. And the best part is that it manages to be funny at the same time.     In my opinion this is easily one of the most ingenious movies ever made.
0060254920|5.0|This book brings back memories as a child.  My favorite Aunt gave this book to my brother.  Now my son can't go a day without hearing it.   &quot;Max&quot; gets sent to his room and &quot;Max &quot; has a wonderful imagination!  You follow this with him through this beautifully illustrations.  This book is a true classic and it still makes me smile each time I now read it for my son.
0790736233|5.0|Before you read the novel you should read Sagan's COSMOS in which book Dr. Sagan sets the idea of how human race would be contacted by a civilization form from outter space. Both scopes, scientific and pseudo-religious, are considered by the last minutes of the movie. Even when Dr. Sagan was an atheist he left a margin for a religious explanation of what the heaven is. Altough I do not agree with the believe that humans somehow survive death I just loved how the movie toched so sensitive topic.
0440219078|2.0|I am an Eighth Grader in Middle School.  I read this book for my reading class, in a few days.  Lots of my friends had read the book before and liked it.  The story is about a Utopian community and a boy, Jonas, learning more about the outside world.  I did not find the story line very intriguing.  In fact, I found it a little boring.  I found myself just wanting to finish the book, instead of enjoying it.  There weren't many surprises along the way, and it failed to keep me guessing throughout the book.  My predictions were almost all correct, and book just seemed to stop.  The ending was probably the worst part of the book.  The chapters leading up to the ending seemed to go too fast for me.  It was like Ms. Lowry just decided to end the book there.  There were other things in the book that just seemed never to be explained.  They just were.  For example, the places in the book, like the family units, and House of the Old, were not described very well.  The author never gave you a visual picture. You couldn't imagine yourself there, like in other good books.  I also found it too unrealist for me.  It wasn't a BAD book, just not a good one.
B000003TA4|5.0|When I bought this cd, I thought it would be okay, considering I liked many of the radio singles such as Lithium,  or In Bloom.  When I got it home I listened to some of the songs you never hear on the radio and those are even better.  This isn't any of the crap that you hear listening to limp bizkit or blink 182, this is real music. Not a product of the media.  Buy this cd.  Thank you.
0425152251|4.0|Sophies world was very educating for me, especially the capitel about Freud and Darwin. I used this book for learning english, and therefore i read it four times (with every new turn, I learned more vocabularies and a better understanding of the plot and the philosophers) So I snatched two flies at the same time.
0452282152|2.0|I was dissapointed in this novel.  From the hype I was expecting to be transported to 17th C. Holland, and to understand more about the great painter Vermer.   Wrong.  Nothing happens, no insight, no layers of meaning.  Perhaps a good children's book--but really, what is the fuss!
0679879269|5.0|I LOVED it!  This book has got to be one of the best books I've EVER read!  Trust me on this, I have very high standards, and The Amber Spyglass meets them wonderfully.  Just one thing, in order to think as highly of this book as I do, you must read Book 1 and Book 2, or you will be lost.  It won't be a huge burden, though, because those two are just as wonderful and great.  Once again, you HAVE to read this book!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Firstly i'll begin this review by responding to the ignorant one star review by Slayerized. How you can say that this band lacks talent and then flog off the pathetic nu metal band Sevendust and to a lesser extent the new age Sepultura. You obviously know very little about good guitarists because the two Slipknot guitarists put their sevendust opponents to shame with some of the best and most complex riffing you are likely to here in the nu metal world. Also you did not mention anything about the brilliant drumming work of Joey Jordison (with minimal assistance from the two percussionists). Joey in my opinion has joined the likes of Igor Cavalera (sepultura), Vinnie paul (Pantera), Gene Hoglan (Strapping Young Lad), Dave Lombardo (ex-slayer, Fantomas) and Raymond Herrera (fear factory) as one of the finest drummers in the world. Incidentally Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose would not make my top 100 list of best drummers.<br />Anyway back to the task at hand... This mesmerising debut from the Iowa nine piece is a refreshing change from the lame brigade of nu metal bands and rap metal wannabes infesting the current metal scene (e.g. Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin park, taproot, Disturbed, sevendust, papa Roach etc, etc...). Boasting a blistering twin axe attack, complimented by rumbling down tuned basslines, brilliant percussion and doublebass onslaught and creepy samples/scratches this watertight lineup impresses well before frontman Corey Taylor screams intelligent, aggressive heartfelt vocals while still displaying melody and a terrific vocal range. This music is death metal with greater variation and melody and a very minimal hip-hop influence (only one, liberate, no life). The best songs on this album are Eyeless, surfacing, SIC, wait and bleed, purity (now taken off the album), spit it out, and the atmospheric album closer scissors. However, the whole album is brilliant with the songs wait and bleed, no life, only one and liberate showcasing Corey's impressive vocal range and the brilliant grooves and change ups by a band of tremendous talent.<br />I am not a huge fan of nu metal but slipknot take the genre to another level with this masterful debut. Apparently their upcoming sophomore effort will be even faster and heavier then this album!!! As for slayerized why don't you listen to some real metal such as Strapping Young lad, Pantera, Acid bath, fear factory, Machine Head, old metallica and Skinlab ( however stick with Slayer) and then try to criticise this album. By the way White Zombie were legendary Rob Zombie is a joke!!
B000006TRV|5.0|This is my second-favorite Floyd album (after &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;), so I don't think I can disagree with any positive remark made about &quot;The Wall.&quot;  For a five-star rating, you're dang straight I think it's a masterpiece!  What I'd like to do first is caution the casual browser who heard &quot;Another Brick Part 2&quot; on the radio, or thinks that all Pink Floyd is like &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  &quot;The Wall&quot; is quite simply one of the most depressing works ever put together in a recording studio.<br />I made the mistake of seeing the movie before listening to the entire album.  For those who have never seen the movie, I'm just going to say that it's a truly nightmarish experience.  There is imagery in there that one would never think to incorporate into the darkest recesses of their dreamscapes... In Alan Parker's own words, &quot;It just hits you over the head&quot; and doesn't let up.  So after seeing the movie, for a very long time, I could not dissociate the brilliant music and writing from the overly effective horror show of the film.  It took me four months to come back to the album and LISTEN to it.<br />The music and lyrics also hit the listener over the head, but in a much more subtle, psychological manner.  (That seems like an oxymoron, but it's not.)  To really appreciate the nuances included with this album, it's necessary to go through it repeatedly.  By &quot;repeatedly,&quot; I mean...um... many more times than is probably healthy.  But there is a lot there.  And it's all uniformly pessimistic and dark.  Unadulterated Waters.  The movie is an onslaught, the album is an infiltration.  The worms eat into your brain, they don't feast on your carnal impulses as the movie does.  (If you listen to the album, that last sentence will also make more sense.)<br />The titular Wall is a metaphor for the separation from humanity.  In the album it is built and experienced by a rock star named &quot;Pink,&quot; but the themesare universal, and Roger Waters includes plenty of his trademark political commentary.  I think everyone at least once in their life has found themself inside a little bunker where they've retreated from the pressures of life.  But as this saga makes terrifically clear, the separation from humanity is much more dangerous than dealing with it...<br />Stylistically, &quot;The Wall&quot; is almost completely hard rock, a far cry from the psychadelic R&amp;B that Pink Floyd perfected with &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  Like &quot;DSOTM,&quot; it is also a single work much more than a collection of songs.  The use of sound effects and dialogue is much more important and prevalent here than any other Pink Floyd album, but it does not detract from the quality of the songs.  Plenty of songs from this album get radio play.  &quot;Happiest Years/Another Brick&quot; is on classic rock stations a couple times weekly, and &quot;Empty Spaces/Young Lust,&quot; &quot;Hey You,&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot; are crowd pleasers that surface with frequency.  &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is a showstopping anthem that, despite largely context-dependent lyrics, a lot of people have told me is their favorite Pink Floyd song of all time.  A lot of music fans may take an album and say they love every song on it, but for me, this is especially true.  I have even gotten into the melody-defficient &quot;Don't Leave Me Now.&quot;<br />Sometimes &quot;The Wall&quot; comes across like a twisted Hollywood musical on acid, and perhaps that's an apt description, but it does serious disservice to the depth and complexity of it.  Roger Waters poured his shredded soul into this magnum opus, and his blood, sweat, and tears (I mean those to be taken literally) show in the grit and guts that propel this epic.  But Waters fan though I am, I also give due credit to David Gilmour, who claimed his contributions to this piece went unacknowledged (most Floyd fans know &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; was his lastreal collaboration with Waters), and to Bob Ezrin whose orchestrations are especially appreciated in the climatic &quot;Trial.&quot;<br />All in all, there's a lot to be found in &quot;The Wall.&quot;  It is a must buy for any rock - or even casual music - fan.  But I deem it absolutely necessary to check out other, earlier Floyd music first.  I was almost turned off to Floyd when my over-eager friend badgered me into watching &quot;The Wall&quot; before I was really ready for it.  The album is also not very easily accessible.  Sure, some of the songs sound great, but until you're accustomed to the full-concept-album ordeal, it might be best to put this near the top of your wish list, and purchase after you're prepared for a journey far beyond the darkest side of the moon...
B000003TAW|5.0|I have been listening to this CD since I was a kid, and since I was a kid, I have loved every track. From &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot; to &quot;Only in Dreams,&quot; this 10-track CD is a rollercoaster ride through relationships, surfing and the life of a nerd. Rivers' lyrics are hilarious but yet come from real-lfie experiences, which is what makes this CD so genuine. Every song has a life of itself, and of course, this CD wouldn't be what it is without the classic &quot;In the Garage.&quot; &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; is one of my current favorites, along with &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;No One Else.&quot; Hell, if &quot;Surf Wax America&quot; doesn't get your toe tapping, you must be dead!
0060930187|4.0|This is a very pointed look at a young woman's descent into psychosis. Plath is a blunt author and there are many questions as to if this book is an autobiography. The main character, Esther, uses many aliases (aliai?) and tells a story that lines up quite well with that of Mrs.Plath. This was a required reading book this year at school for me, but I will tell you this. I read it over the summer and liked it-but I enjoyed it more this time around. This is a powerful book and is written with a lot of well thought out imagery and symbolism. If you have seen the movie Girl, Interupted or read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest you will find this book of interest. But if you have a light stomach beware in the last three or so chapters. One of my all time favorites!

B00000163G|5.0|Hey man, if you are looking for a good rap cd then get 2 Pacs' All Eyez On Me.  I'm not really a big rap fan, and living were I do it is really easy to tell why.  There aren't any stations in Colorado that play rap except one in Denver, and I have only started to really listen to it.  I had already started listening to 2 Pac before that, but mostely it was just the song &quot;Changes&quot; that I ever heard.  Still I was craving something more then that, so I went to my local cd store and picked up All Eyez On Me, not really knowing if it would be good or not.  Boy, was I ever impressed!  This cd is really great.  The words that 2 Pac wrote have been said to have been really great, but i never thought that they were this good.  The beats on this cd are pretty good, and it is really easy to listen to this cd over and over again.  I personally, think that disc one is better then disc two, but i haven't really looked disc two over yet, so I'll tell you about disc one.  Disc one is all good, with &quot;Life Goes On&quot; being the best cut off the cd.  There are lots off good songs off of this disc such as &quot;How Do You Want It&quot;, &quot;Only God Can Judge Me&quot;, &quot;I Ain't Mad At Cha&quot;, and &quot;What'z Ya Phone #&quot;.  All of these songs and more are very good.  If you were to go out and buy a 2 Pac cd right now, this would probably be one of the the best two or three to get.  Many of the songs are good and so are the beats!
6304817037|5.0|This concert video is for those people who think that the Clapton of the 90s has lost his guitar skills. The reason why everyone does not know how great he is, is because in the mid to late 90s Clapton's best work, especially live, has been blinded by todays teen pop. I have listened to every live album of Clapton's I could find. Eric Clapton is one of the greatest live performers and in my book the greatest guitarist, technically and for me emotionally. I have looked sincerely into countless guitarists and solos. Old love and I shot the sherriff in this concert are among the best solos i have heard ever. Five long years is great too, if you have patience. And those of you are wondering why this old, skinny white guy with glasses who did that slow song about his son is revered as one of the best guitarists in the world, this video is for you. Great music today has to be searched for. And if you are reading this review, you have found it.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Since Herzeleid hit the shelves I was hooked on the heavy hitting sound of Rammstein.  I've been waiting for this release for a while now and here are some of my thoughts.<br />Mutter is a very sophisticated album.  It's well balanced in terms of sound, meaning that it's not 100% hardcore all the way thru.  Some tracks like \\"Links 234\\" are very hard hitting and is the kind of stuff you'd expect from Rammstein. Then there's others like \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\" that includes a symphony-like sound, adding an incredible depth and sadness to the track while keeping the gutiar crunch and metal sound mixed in very well.  <br />There is so much depth to this album! Which is partly due to the keyboardist who adds the right sound effect/synth at exactly the right time.  The guitar riffs are mostly different as well, which adds to the freshness of Mutter. The lyrics are alot more heartfelt and poetic then the previous albums.  However, \\"Zwitter\\" (poking fun at hermaphodites funny as hell, go read the english lyrics) is pretty much the only track that's kind of sick if taken liturally.<br />\\"Feuer Frei!\\" isn't as bad of a track as some make it sound.  It's fast, heavy and hard. I had the volume turned up pretty high by the time I got to this track and i nearly swerved off the road while driving because it started out soft, and then all of a sudden there was a guitar/drum punch and it scared the Stufing out of me! <br />Every track is great and I am fully satisfied with Mutter.  However if your looking for 100% Hardcore all the way thru, you might be just a LITTLE bit (and i mean a little) disappointed.  \\"Nobel\\" for instance is pretty much a laid back track which might not appease you. The rest aren't nearly as slow as this one is.  <br />Along with many of the commenters, I agree Rammstien has matured greatly with Mutter. It's very refined and extremely well exacuted, maintaining their practically trademarked sound and yet blowing a big gust of fresh air to your ears.<br />I can't pick a favorite song, mainly because I like them all. The tracks fit together like a puzzle to create a wonderful album. <br />In short: it's DEFINATELY worth the money, It has growh in sound yet still the same Rammstein you've always known, lyrically superior then their previous albums, and it's very well mixed and great in sound.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004XMTH|5.0|This really is a truly talented musical,all the music in it will keep you cheery.....except maybe for Memory. The only thing i am  not to happy about about was the editing of &quot;Growltiger's Last Stand&quot;. It could have been on here,there was no reason for it not to be.  But I guess the reason why i gave it five stars was because it was hard for me to not to put less than five stars! Anyway, this is a VERY good musical and i HIGHLY recomend it!
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is, without a doubt, not made for everyone.  If you believe that the world is a beautiful place, this album is not for you.  If you have never been worried about anything in your life, this album is not for you.  If you've never graduated high school, this album *might* not be for you.<br />Everyone else, rejoice!  Someone has finally been able to express the chaos and terror of the real world in a way that means something!<br />I'm not saying this because I'm a hardcore Radiohead fan, either.  In fact, this is perhaps the first album of theirs I ever really sat down to listen to.  I'm saying this because inside all the chaos, there was something that I knew.<br />From the very beginning of the album, there is the sense that something just isn't right, and it all moves from there.  Chords clash, cues are missed, and vocals are muddled, if not non-existant.<br />And it's all brilliant.<br />Somehow, Yorke and [the band] have found a way to tap into the stress of everyday life, rendering it all out musically.  Even the lyrics (as usual) represent the voices that reside inside the average head:  &quot;You've tried the best you can/The best you can is not good enough,&quot;  &quot;I'm not here/This isn't happening.&quot;<br />It has been said that when the truth is exposed, it will either be embraced or shunned.  That would explain the reaction to this album, I think.
B00003CXFV|4.0|[Take 1] This is a fine movie about the triumph of a determined woman who fights sexism and snobbery in a worthy battle against the harmful results of corporate greed and government apathy (or is that deregulation?).  <br />[Take 2] This is an in-your-face story about a selfish woman's pursuit of personal success that incidentally benefits a worthy cause.<br />[Conclusion] Watch it.  Decide for yourself.  It's a good movie. The modern production values make it a better watch than Silkwood.  But it's much more a 90s triumph of personal self-promotion than a 70s battle of good against evil - and that's a shame.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Personally, I think that this is the best Bond Brosnan's done so far. Even more so than Tomorrow Never Dies or The World Is Not Enough. The Tina Turner sung theme song is also one of the best yet. The villain is also one of the more original 007 villians, since he happens to be an old friend of Bond's, 006, who was &quot;killed&quot; by the Russians in a factory they were supposed to destroy. When Bond meets Xenia Onatopp, the link to the Russian Mafia, Bond learns that she is about to steal a powerful helicopter prototype. When things get worse, a military communications post in a small Russian town in the middle of nowhere is wiped out by a Russian secret weapon known as &quot;Goldeneye&quot; (an electrostatic pulse beamed from a satellite that will knock out any and all electronic circuits, to disable communication) under the corrupt Genreal Orumov, Bond is called in to investigate. The helicopter is Bond's link between the military post, General Orumov and the Russian Mafia, which is now run by, 006 (aka Alec Trevelyan) and General Orumov! The movie then goes into a cat-and-dog chase between Trevelyan and Bond, where each is out to get revenge on the other. Bond then learns that 006 plans to use Goldeneye on London, with the purpose of wiping out London's computer systems, causing global economic chaos.<br />The DVD's also one of the better Bond discs in the whole series. There's more stuff than a lot of the other ones combined - trailers, TV spots, commentary (I would've liked to have seen one with Brosnan, though), the two standard documentaries, and a really good transfer, too. I think, after Connery and Moore, Brosnan is the best choice they could've used for Bond, since he fits the role perfectly. Dalton didn't make as good of a James Bond as Brosnan did, IMO. While the action scenes were a little more far-fetched than in some of the other Bond movies, this one definately had its moments, like the tank chase through downtown St. Petersburg, or the factory chase in the opening. However, it's great to see that the Bond franchise didn't dissolve after Dalton left, though. It's also great that the return of Bond was one of the best Bonds in the series, too.
B0000089GM|5.0|just some clarifications on the German:<BR> 'hast' is a homophone and a homonym for 2 words in german.  They are the 2nd person singular forms of the verbs haben (to have) and hassen (to hate).<br />'Du hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt' could be translated as &quot;You have asked me and I haven't said&quot; or &quot;'You hate me?' you asked and I have not said&quot;.  If you read it as 'have' then you can think of the overall meaning of the verse to be &quot;You have me.  You asked me (probably if I love you) but I haven't said.&quot;<br />Or, on a more complex note, you could take the lines from &quot;Du. Du hast. Du hast mich.&quot; to be hate, and then the &quot;Du hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt&quot; to mean &quot;You have asked me and I haven't said.&quot; <br />Taken as a whole the essential meaning becomes 'you hate me because I haven't answered you' which would be very clever lyricly, creating multiple levels of meaning.  But it could all be coincidence.  It only gets weird because the English version lyrics create a problem.  Besides, Tier (animal) is a much more fun!

0375703764|5.0|This book is not for people who do not like to read.  Period.  Nor is it one for those who dislike challenges, either.  But, for those who can penetrate its muddled format, this is one of the most absorbing, eerie books in recent years.<br />&quot;House of Leaves&quot; tells two tales, in a way.  The primary is that of the Navidson family, who discover that the house they bought, to escape the pressures of city living, is more then they bargained for.  The second is that of Johnny Truant, who discovers the account of the former, and how it affects him.<br />The primary story is presented as &quot;The Navidson Record,&quot; an essay based on the filmed record of a - well, phenomenal - house.  This essay was supposedly written by old Zampano, after having seen the film.  Problem is, Zampano was blind.  Upon Zampono's death, Johnny truant takes on the task of pulling it all together, which is no small feat, considering the old man wrote it on anything he could get his hands on.  What we read is Truant's final product, with his own story told in a series of footnotes.<br />As written, there are long periods of footnotes, sometimes even footnoted themselves.  Print goes in all directions on the page, intersecting and enmeshing with itself.  There are even long periods with but one or two words per page.  For those whose dedication is weak, this is a daunting task, and as if that weren't enough, there are even two appendices, and a collection of photographs.  (Someone stop me if I've forgotten something.)<br />All of this would mean nothing if the material were dull, though, and it is my pleasure to say that it is not.  The two different tales play off wonderfully, with &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; a sweeping account of a fascinating, if not particularly frightening, story, and Truant himself telling of his increasingly more disturbing hallucinations and paranoia in a personal and gritty fashion.<br />You may even learn a few things, as well.  Included as a part of &quot;TNR&quot; are several more educational essays, including one on echoes, and another on Greek mythology.<br />All in all, this book is well worth the money if you're a dedicated reader.  If not, I would reccomend finding it at the local library before you make any final decisions.
0137549202|5.0|This is probably the most complete reference in DSP. It's full of examples covering the whole stuff in DSP. However this is certainly not fur use as an introductory book because the aim is not the explanation of fundamental concepts in DSP (for that go to Lyons &quot;Understanding Digital Signal Processing&quot;). Maybe it is possible to learn DSP with this book but then as a companion of a good undergrad course, not for self-study.<br />As stated by another reviewer, this book is over-crowded with developments, details and examples that could be overwhelming to the newcomer. This is probably its biggest drawback, in that its completeness hinders on its readability. So be aware that this is not an easy DSP book, it's THE DSP book.
B000002JS0|5.0|Okay if you look at my page you will see that I have quite a diverse musical taste...this said...for Power Blues Hard Rock from the seventies not much compares...a few...but they say to focus on the album. <br />I saw AC/DC in the seventies on what I think was one of their first, probally first American tours,  backing up Styx or some other lame (now) band.  I couldn't get the image of  Angus climbing  up on the stacks and screaming out the solo for &quot;The Jack&quot;.  later Bon Scott carrying him around the audience on his back.  It wasn't easy to find that first album after the show...took a few weeks,  come to think of it the second album &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; might have been the release they were touring on.   Man I'm old.  At the time Punk Rock was just getting a listen and I liked some of it.  AC/DC was so different sounding that we couldn't decide what catagory they should go in.  With that clean loud electric blues based sound and clear dirty vocals Whew....We thought maybe they were punk...where did these guys come from?  I wish punk had sounded like this.  I have to say that these days somgs like,  &quot;The Jack&quot;, &quot;Can I Sit  Next To You Girl&quot; and &quot;She's Got Balls&quot;  feel pretty damn juvenile...but hey I was a juvenile, for what these songs were they were pretty fresh,  original sounding but/and of course on the PC side,   way sexist.  This album was actually partially responsible for turning me on to the blues...Yes it's true.  The Jack.....one of the best solos in rock...up there with Page's on &quot;Whole lotta Love&quot;  The other thing cool about the recording was the clean production, We listened (we a car load of.....and cruising kids bopping our heads...before it was called head banging) usually on a car stereo, and even if the system was basic with beat up speakers it was loud and good sounding.  The loudest best sounding tape in the collection, always used to test out a new system, speakers or power booster,a tribute to minimal production, unlike many other bands of the era.  <br />Now for the part that will make some people unhappy; when Bon Scott died that was it,  they lost it.  I don't say things like this too much in print but I think &quot;Back In Black&quot; sucks, (ahh &quot;Shook Me&quot; is ok sometimes) overplayed, overplayed, even over produced and what's his name was no replacement for Bon!!! The soul and feeling that Scott put into a song and the cool underproduction on his vocals cannot be replaced by screams and reverb.....Ya ya but when Bon screamed it was diffent....of course in my opinion.<br />Now what I want to find is CD copies of the first two Australian releases which were compiled to form this version of &quot;High Voltage&quot;. Later culled for some cuts on &quot;Dirty Deeds...&quot;  The two realeases are called &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;T.N.T.&quot;  You all will of course recognize these titles.  Aprox. half of each one was rejected to complete the American version.  &quot;High Voltage&quot; features a cartoon type painting of a large electrical transformer and a small dog...you know the one,  with a black circle around his eye (if memory serves) lifting it's leg and urinating on it (the transformer or generator).  &quot;T.N.T.&quot; has a photograph of pieces of wood from a TNT crate laying flat on rocky soil, on the front cover and inside are the bios you find in the American release.  A couple or three songs from them have not made it onto &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; or &quot;H.V&quot; American and include excellent! covers of two great songs.  These I can listen to still and often even with my disposition towards exploitative and sexist lyrics (don't get me too wrong I can't help but pull oot &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;,  [that song, another great solo,  not as much as the afforementioned] or &quot;Powerage&quot; right after listening to Miles Davis [I read once that Angus said he got the ideas and inspiration for his solos fromjazz saxophone and horn players] or David Grisman etc)  Oh ya these two songs are Chuck Berry's &quot;School Days&quot; and the blues classic &quot;Baby Please Don't Go&quot;.  &quot;Baby Please&quot; predates and blows away Nugent's vesion though is in the same high power/energy vein.  If you havn't caught onto the soul and feeling I was talking about in Bon Scott's vocals just listen to him singing  &quot;rock rock rock and roll, feelin' is there body and soul&quot; or in &quot;Baby Please...&quot;  &quot;Why must you leave me,  lyin' on my back...don't leave me,    please! don't go!&quot;. Angus' solos  just plain cool!!!  Also the way they slide into &quot;School Days&quot;; steady one/two note bass, then drums light but powerful, the Angus brothers rythm kick in (also light and powerful, energetic, uncontrived) the figure ends /cut and Scott: &quot;Up in the mornin' and off to school.  Instead of the usual way guitarists cover Chuck they use that same guitar figure from &quot;Long Way to The Top&quot;.  By the way ever hear the version of &quot;Long Way&quot; done by a kinda lame band (on record) called Nantucket.<br />Oh well did I talk enough.  Still 5 stars.
6303314015|5.0|There will simply never be enough praise lavished on this phenomenal movie.  Not only is it the most beautifully animated and deeply layered Disney film ever, I'd argue that this movie is quite frankly one of the best movies of our time, period.<br />I first saw The Lion King back when it was originally released--I was ten years old at the time.  As a younger child, I was struck by the film's beauty and plot, but now, as an 18-year-old English major, I have to admit, my original enjoyment of the film has grown to an all out love.  There are few movies I can watch often and still be moved by, but The Lion King delivers, every time. <br />Anyone familiar with epic mythological tales, and particularly those interested in Joseph Campbell's studies on the journey of the hero, simply MUST see this film.  And for those who aren't, The Lion King's themes are just as easily accessible.  I have to agree that older children and adults will take the most from this film, but don't let disparaging reviewers deter you from allowing your younger children to see this film--there are lessons and themes presented in it that prove valuable, even to younger children, should they be properly overseen and clarified by their parents.  <br />The animation in The Lion King is breathtaking.  The opening sequence and Simba's subsequent presentation are beautiful, and this quality never wavers in the film.  Just as phenomenal is the music in this movie--the songs are catchy and melodic, and the score is even more intense.  I cannot recommend this film enough--if you have not seen it, do so.  And if you've only seen it once, watch it again.  This film deserves attention and scrutiny.  :)
6305205620|4.0|I am another 30+ year old fan.  The sound of this DVD is excellent as is the camera footage.  <br />DOWNSIDE-The ONLY thing I find distracting is that they play under &quot;unnatural concert lighting&quot; and it seems to throw them just a bit.  You can tell that they seem to be out of their element with the camera lights and all.<br />UPSIDE-I have shown this DVD to friends of mine that are NOT Metallica or Heavy Metal fans whatsoever and they all agreed that there is a lot of precise talent that goes into making this band.  They all admitted their misconceived notions and that Metallica is not just loud, fist shaking, guitar slapping, ear-breaking noise.  Even my friends that buy every Pop Hit was amazed at what Kirk was doing.  I think Metallica gained a few more fans.  I really enjoyed the perks of this heavily technology ladened DVD.  For those of you that have a DVD on your computer or a internet connected media system-----you will especially enjoy the extras.  I found all the photo's of the tour especially interesting.  <br />I just wish Aerosmith or Ozzy could come up with a comparable DVD.  <br />In closing, this DVD is worth your hard earned cash.
B000002MFN|5.0|One of the things that many of you have learned from Madonna, is that she is always experiencing with different music genres, and also going into the inevitable controversy which is what she is famous for. But many people seem to tear into &quot;Erotica&quot; like it's the worse album in the world, which is very far from the truth. On &quot;Erotica&quot; Madonna explores Sex, Lust, Relationships (that are both good and bad), with even a tad pinch of despair which wraps this album up beautifully. Madonna introduces her sadomasochist prostitute in &quot;Erotica,&quot; does a great rendition of Nancy Sinatra's sultry &quot;Fever,&quot; Madonna's upbeat dance hit &quot;Deeper And Deeper,&quot; the lonely, isolated girl in &quot;Bad Girl&quot; the depressing &quot;In This Life&quot; which Madonna sings about people she has lossed to the AIDS virus. If you look closely at this album, you can realize that some of Madonna's best talent really shines through on this album. I can recommend this album to virtually anybody that won't get offended, because remember this album isn't for everybody. But anyway, enjoy!
B0000028VT|5.0|This CD is definitely a must. The album had five big hit singles spawned from it (Dreamlover, Hero, Never Forget You, Without You, and Anytime You Need A Friend), which is proof of the disc's merits. Pick it up.
0060278242|5.0|Lirael is the breath taking sequel to Sabriel one of the only modern books which can equal it in its amazing network of pure fantasy and its classic good versus evil.<br /> This book takes a new twist and focuses upon the mysterious Clayr one of the bloodlines of the old kingdom. I for one was intrigued by these beings and yearned to learn more in the first book. Within these ôracles ranks there is one who has not been gifted with the ability of the &quot;Sight&quot;. This is the power which allow the Clayr to see in the futur. She is 14 and has not been gifted with it while here other friends had it anything for 2 to 4 years ago. she feels completely out of place until she becomes an assistant librarian in the Clayrs massive library. ALong with her magicaly summoned dog and her curiousity she learns more and becomes a more calm woman.<br /> The other part part of the story focuses upon Sameth or prince sam who is sabriels and touchstones (the king and queens) son. he decides to leave the royal life for he is the Abhorsen in waiting. the only defence against evil necromancers of the world yet he is afraid to venture into death. As he runs away he then runs into mogget an incredibly    powerful free magic elemental who serves the abhorsen framily. <br />Meanwhile Lirael has found three mysterious gifts and is given a quest. She meets Sameth and much is revealed between the two such as they are both looking for sams friend Nicholas who has been in the grips of the evil necromancer Hedge. <br />The book revolves around the fact theat there is an ancient evil growing which is even more powerful than Kerrigor. Plans have been set in motion against the bloodlines and now every force possible is preparing and learning and waiting to defend against this mysterious force. The story turns and twists and this book is an instint favorite. The best part is that there has to be a sequel which i am eagerly awayiting i hope this helped (Please email me if you have different viewsor if you want to talk about the two books thnx)
B00005J6UP|4.0|About 10 years ago, i saw The Goonies for the first time.  I was in awe at the complex characters and their personalities, and especially at the concept of the pirate ship filled with gold and jewels beneath an italian resturant.  I liked the chinese kid, I cant remember his name right now, and his kool gadgets.  I was kinda freaked out by that monster that is chained up under the italian resturant though, he was kinda scary at first, but then i kinda warmed up to him cause i saw he was nice.  Although it may seem farfetched to someone else, i overall think the Goonies is a great movie and a little getaway everytime i find the time to sit down and relive my childhood.
0380977281|5.0|Stardust was my first Gaiman book to read, and it transfixed me with a sense of wonder. I went on to read his other books, which did not fail to astound me again!<br />The story line is magnificent, the characters are amazingly believable, the number of pages way to short. It's just beautiful.<br />Unfortunately, the only thing marring this work of genius are some explicit sexual scenes, leaving nothing to the imagination. There is some crude language, but these things were not enough to make this anything but five stars. I have made a habit of keeping a black marker to touch up those sentences that need not be there, so after I'm done it's suitable for children, because the before mentioned things would be the only things keeping it from being suitable for children. I'm sure that children would love it as much as adults do, because works of genius genarally enthrall wide audiences with its words.<br />Buy this book, it would be one of your best purchases yet.
B000005HLV|5.0|This album took 5 years to complete, and I think it really shows. Each song was clearly specially crafted to cultivate death and aggression in their own special way. I can't think of ANY album that gives me the dark, dreary feeling this does-I can practically smell decay when I put on &quot;Buried by Time and Dust&quot;. If you're looking for the Spice Girls or the Kovenant, this album is not for you
0736645209|5.0|It's hard to do The Hours justice in a review. Imagine a multi generation human drama of John Irving, but flawless and without contradictions in just over 200 pages. Reading this meticulously researched and well-contrived novel, you get the distinct impression that Michael Cunningham had the whole concept laid out in front of him, before he started writing. It hangs together so well, in a way too perfect at times and in the process it lacks the free flowing feel of the likes of Annie Proulx and Barbara Kingslover.<br />The main story in the Hours is that of Clarissa and Richard, who were close friends and lovers in their youth and remained best friends to the present day when we see them in New York city in their early fifties. They are now both gay, and nearly all the characters that we come across in the present day part of the novel are gay and lesbian. <br />Intertwined with the present day Clarissa are the lives of Laura Brown in post WWII Los Angeles suburb and Virginia Wolf in England in the early 20's. Laura and Virginia are both suffocating in their ordinary comfortable lives, trapped in straight marriages. They both love and care for their husbands and families but so yearn to free themselves from their ordinary lives. Both are obsessed with the passing of the hours, time and death, both see secret pleasurable attraction in other women.<br />Cunningham language and style are very enjoyable. He takes a small object and describes in great detail, \\"Virginia can see that the bird is laid on the grass compactly, its wings folded up against its body. She knows it has died already in Quentin's palms. It seems to have wanted to make the smallest possible package of itself. Its eye, a perfect black bead is open and its gray feet, larger than you'd expect them to be, are curled in on themselves. It could be a kind of a hat, it could be the missing link between millinery and death.\\" Cunningham gets you to visualize and sense a scenery or a situation, then moves takesyou inside his characters \\" She (Virginia) would like to lie down in its place. No denying it she would like that. Vanessa and Julian can go on about their business, their tea and travels, while she Virginia, a bird sized Virginia, lets herself metamorphose from an angular difficult woman into an ornament on a hat, foolish, uncaring thing.\\"<br />Of the four primary relationships in The Hours, Virginia & Leonard, Laura & Dan, Clarissa & Richard and Clarissa & Sally, we only get a 2 sided view once. We enter Sally's mind and witness her true care and affection for Clarissa. With all of the other \\"couples\\" we come across, primary or secondary, gay or straight, the relationships are unhappy and unfulfilled. We are never really clear on Clarissa, would she have wanted Richard more had he not been gay, is she as devoted to Sally, many questions remain unanswered, she remains a bit of a mystery, like the original Mrs. Dalloway.<br />You don't have to read Virginia Wolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" to appreciate this book fully. You don't even need to have read any work by Virginia Wolf to enjoy, get into and be touched by The Hours. The Hours will make you want to read Virginia Wolf and the best place to start is The Voyage Out, her first book. Enjoy!
014028009X|5.0|This book was wonderful, with a brilliant cast of characters. It was at times fall-down hilarious. The situations Bridget is in are nothing outstanding or unusual, but they are somehow made unique and worth reading about. Any woman can find at least a little bit of herself in Bridget.
6302799066|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made.  Peter Sellers is a comedic genius in his 3 roles.  It's sad to think that Sellers died so young.  He had much to offer.
0345350499|4.0|I must have read three or four novel series based on the Arthurian legend (Mallory of course, T.H. White's Once and Future King, Bernard Cornwell's series and of course seen films like Excalibur and First Knight.) Do I love Arthurian legends or what? So I couldn't put Bradley's The Mists of Avalon down for a moment. It was riveting.<br /><br />Marion Zimmer Bradley is a respected fantasy writer and highly skilled. Her version of Arthur's birth and reign are from the Druidic or Pagan viewpoint. So we get a glimpse of Arthur's birth and his relationship to his sister Morgaine through pagan rituals. The \\"fairy\\" side of the story (Morgan le Fay or Morgan the Fairy, The Lady of the Lake, Avalon) are developed beyond what anyone else has done in other versions of Arthur and Camelot.<br /><br />I enjoyed Mists of Avalon and thought the characters are well-drawn. The mysteries of Britain in post-Roman times before the first crusades are intriguing.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the Pagan religion as Bradley writes it is imbued with modern Wiccan beliefs, which archaeology and history tell us are rather different than how the ancients worshipped. Still, this is fiction, and so it's good to remember that how Arthur originated, and how the Pagans revered him is still shrouded in the mists of time.
B000005JAX|2.0|I have been a fan of DM since the mid-80's and I am aware that Martin Gore wrote almost every song. So, like a lot of other people, I was unpleasantly surprised to see that Gore didn't write any of them. And how do people know this ep is a collection of covers? I certaintly didn't recognize any of the songs. And Gore doesn't even seem to give the original guys credit because they are not mentioned.<br />As for the songs themselves... only 'Compulsion' comes across as a song that sounds anything at all like Depeche Mode. All the rest are too slow or too experimental. Of course, Gore's voice is always nice to listen to, but in these unfamiliar surroundings, that alone can't make up for the generally bad songs.<br />Don't be misled by all of the other reviews written by die-hard DM fans - these people would NEVER actually say anything about our favorite synth-boys! The only reason I'm writing a review is because I'm looking forward to their new album coming out in May.
B00003CWOL|4.0|This movie would have gotten 5 stars except there are no special DVD features. Unless you just collect DVDs, I would buy the VHS. As I look up Dogma on Amazon today though, I see that there is a special DVD coming out in late June!! With almost 2 hours of deleted footage, interviews with almost the entire cast and a whole bunch other extras, I'm saving my money for the Dogma Special Edition. This movie is awesome, I don't think I got all the jokes since I'm not Catholic, but I got most of them, and they were hilarious. This movie takes a harsh look at religion and the Bible without losing sight that this movie is a comedy. This is Kevin Smith at his best it almost makes me forgive him for blowing his chance at Spiderman. Dogma is up there with Clerks as Smith's best movie. Having all these celebrities in one movie is Hollywood's way of making a statement about religion just like Traffic did with drugs. I don't want to give away too much of the plot and I couldn't convey it as well as the actors in Dogma did, so just watch Dogma and enjoy!
B000002KON|5.0|This recording was, and is still, the Kink's finest hour. Composed by Ray Davies as the score for a 1969 British TV series that never got off the ground, it, in it's own humble way ushered in a spate of lesser concept albums. It is neither a rock opera, nor a portentious retelling of the history of England. Rather, it's a collection of postcard perfect scenes of everyday life in the suburbs of post-war England. Yawn,right? Wait a minute, this thing rocks harder than the Kinks had in 5 years! As critic John Mendelsohn points out in the original liner notes, &quot;...there's not a song in the lot, start they with harpsichords or slow military drums, that ends up anything less than great bopping rock.&quot; Ray Davies never quite matched this tiumph, though the Kinks' most successful years were still ahead of them. And what about the content? Well 'Victoria','Drivin', 'Australia', the brilliant 'Shangri-La' and the title tune all deserve to stand along Ray Davies' earlier masterpiece 'Waterloo Sunset'. That's quite an achievement and this CD would merit 10 stars if I could give 'em. I'm givin'them 5 stars. Times two. Cheers.
0451160916|4.0|While I've always loved Stephen King, and never found something written by him to be unenjoyable, in recent years his incredible creativity has seemed to be on the wane to me.  Desperation felt to me like nothing more than a combination of old King storylines that had worked in the past.  Bag of Bones, while actually VERY well written, suffered from similar problems in my mind.  I felt like I knew right where he was going, and there was little suspense.<br />My perception of King, quite honestly, has been as one of our best storytellers, yet only a decent writer.  What I mean by this is kind of complicated.  His plotlines and characters have always been the most interesting things about King's books to me, along with his seemingly effortless ability to keep me wanting to read.  This, I thought, is the power of King.  You simply can't stop reading because he makes you care--no, more than that; he makes it seem imperative that you keep reading to find out what is going to happen.  <br />However, in other areas I felt that he fell flat. I've never viewed him as a man much into the actual CRAFT of writing.  He always seemed to concentrate mainly on character and plot, rather than theme, and I had little respect for the work--or lack thereof--that he put into the shaping of his novels.  Partially, this is because of an image King cultivates.  He has said that he is no &quot;intellectual ball of fire&quot; and that he often doesn't really know where he is going.  That the best writing comes &quot;from the gut&quot; rather than the head.<br />What a pleasant surprise, then, to rediscover The Shining at a time when I am able to better respect King's work.  Not only is this a chilling and imaginative tale, it contains evidence that King was trying to work with deeper issues that those just explored by the plot.<br />The story of Jack, Wendy and Danny Torrance vs. the Overlook Hotel is much more than just a ghost story, or a story about mystical powers of the mind.  What Kingis really exploring here are the effects of history on the present.  And not just concerning the most obvious choice with the Overlook (e.g. ghosts--past--attacking Torrances--present).  It wonders if Jack will overcome his history of alcoholism and physical abuse by his father.  If Wendy will become like her mother or transcend her attitudes.  <br />King also plays around with structure in the Shining.  Throughout the book, there are several references to Shakespeare, and the book is structured to reflect this.  It is divided into five parts to mirror the five act structure of the Shakespearean play, though King moves around some of the elements to keep with the way a modern story is told.  And there are more nuggets of gold present, but I think it is much more interesting to discover them yourself.  <br />Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying that these relatively simple underlying themes make this deserving of the National Book Award.  But it does deepen my respect for King.  I am sure that he would have sold just as many copies without including them, and it heartens me to see he decided to do it anyway, simply because these were ideas that interested him and he felt them relevant to the story he was telling.  I applaud him for that.<br />Read The Shining.  If you never have, then you will be mesmerized by the words King makes dance across the page.  If you have read it, rediscover this classic and find the things you never knew were there.

I laughed so much at many parts that I had to put the book away because I could not see the pages.

B00000IPAX|1.0|Blink 182 once had some integrity as a novelty, and occasionally good alternative band. With this effort, Blink sells out in terrific fassion, intentionally making a record that appeals to pop and alternative radio. Not as catchy as &quot;Dude Racnh,&quot; this CD is not worth your 15 bucks, as it is pure crap through - and - through.
B00004XONN|5.0|When one compares KID A and PABLO HONEY, aside from Thom Yorke's voice, it's difficult to attribute both albums to the same musicians. However, listen to each album in order, and KID A seems a logical extension of OK COMPUTER. <br />Upon first listen, this album left a strange [metaphorical] taste in my mouth. After many more listens, however, the beauty of this album became manifest. <br />From the simplicity of &quot;Everything in it's Right Place&quot;, to the classic Radioheadesque sound of &quot;Optimistic&quot;, to the bleak and shiver-inducing beauty of &quot;Ideoteque&quot;, KID A is a perfect example of what courage and musical creativity can create.<br />It's also a perfect example of the genius of Radiohead; when a voice and drum machine can produce more emotion than 95% of the modern tripe masquerading as music.
1572522232|4.0|Suspiria is a visually stunning piece which is well worth viewing.  Dario Argento was on a roll when he did this film (some may remember Dawn of the Dead, Creepers &amp; Inferno). I particularly like the blue, green and red hues which give the film a gothic/nightmarish vision and lots of atmosphere. Some spectacular/unusual murder sequences(reminiscent of The Omen) and definitely not for the squeamish. <br />Also, a creepy ghoulish cast of characters helps to build tension and incoherence. Some references to alchemy and the occult make it black magical!! <br />I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it for horror fans. Watch it in the dark for maximum effect!!
B00000IPAX|3.0|I love Blink182, OK? I've loved them since Cheshire Cat.  This CD is totally pop.  They were like totally punk music, and then all of a sudden PLOP! They went pop.  I still love Blink182, but this CD is just not their best.  I wonder what happened.  This Cd is still good, but c'mon.  How can people say this a punk CD? This why most people say their sellouts, even though their not.  Blink182 are not sellouts, but their true fans thought this was going to be a punk CD, whic changed everybodys minds on how they viewed Blink.  I would recomend this CD to somebody who hasn't heard Dude Ranch or Cheshire Cat.
B000001IPL|4.0|First and foremost, dispite what other reviews might say, this isn't at all a punk record. Quality punk died out long ago, and although the spirit is in the right place, it has been diluted so much, that all alternative music can be considered punk to some extent. <br />The Offspring are one of the higher quality alternative bands out there. Inferior to Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Oasis, and Weezer (=w=) yet suppirior to meaningless bands like Linkin Park, and Papa Roach. This is the Offspring in their pre-mainstream days, before Americana. It is a very guitar and drum heavy record. Not to the extent that Green Day is, but the drums are fairly high in the mix. The actuall collection of songs is quite good. &quot;Gotta Get Away,&quot; has one of the best opening drum riffs that has been done in a very long time. &quot;Be a Long Time,&quot; and &quot;Smash,&quot; are the two songs that most exemplify the quasi punk parts of this record, and those are the two best songs. &quot;Smash,&quot; is essentially several key songs with filler in between, though those key songs are good enough to make &quot;Smash,&quot; worthwhile.
0452282152|4.0|Have you ever looked at a portrait and wonder about the artist or the subject? Well, Girl With a Pearl Earring magically does this for you by telling the story of Griet and Vermeer. Griet is a very young girl sent to be a maid for Vermeer when her father lost his sight in an accident and could no longer provide for the family. Upon arriving at the Vermeer home Greit is instantly troubled by the family and especially Cornelia (one of many children in the household). She is torn between this man that she is drawn to and what she knows is right. Take a step inside a painting a read this book. You will not be sorry.
B000001FS3|5.0|The &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; is, obviously, U2's most popular album, and probably tying with &quot;Achtung Baby.&quot;  This album is the most pure U2 album the band's ever produced, and defined their sound.  In every song, Bono sings extremely powerfully, with beautiful lyrics.  The Edge really gave the album its texture, and Adam Clayton (he REALLY made 'Exit' the song it is) and Larry Mullen tie the album together.  The album's overall theme seems to be about individual freedom, and all the songs loosely fit under that.<br />The album has bits and pieces of all kinds of music, from the reach-for-the-sky anthems 'Where the Streets Have No Name', 'In God's Country,' and the croud pleasing 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For', and with the folksy 'Red Hill Mining Town' and 'Trip Through Your Wires', and the darkly themed 'Exit' and 'Mothers of the Disappeared'.  'One Tree Hill' is a beautiful song of loss and finding peace, and 'Running to Stand Still', which is about a desperate heroin-addicte.  Best of all is arguably U2's biggest hit of all time, 'With or Without You', a song that leaves you wondering what Bono can't live with or without; a lover or his fame.  It's a beautiful song, one that I loved even before I knew anything about U2.<br />This album is greatly diversed and beautiful, able to move you to smiles or tears.  Serious, dark, and spooky at times, it will haunt you forever.  A must have for fans of music.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|Hi There<br />I cannot believe what a brilliant album this is. Every single song on this disc is so amazing and Morten's Voice has improved so much. My favourite songs are all the tracks, the reason being is because every single song has a brilliant likening to it. I have to give this disc 5 stars because there is no other rating better than this. A-ha has shown the world what a brilliant comeback they have made and they have proven it, thank you guys!!

B00003CXPD|5.0|One of the best, and most underappreciated films of the last Oscar season is Billy Elliot. A compelling, heartbreaking-then-warming story combined with a crackerjack cast makes for a highly entertaining and film that totally transcends struggle and celebrates human desire.<br />Billy, so magnificently and perfectly played by Jamie Bell, is a working class kid with a penchant for ballet, discovered quite by accident but soon fuels his dreams. Julie Walters, Grand Bitter Queens of Ex-Dance Dreamers takes the strapping lad under her wing to teach him how to fly. As Billy strives to dance, he find himself struggling against the harsh dynamics of his family, embroiled with the dyamics of a miners' strike.<br />The story in the film is a guaranteed winner, but soon transcends itself as it deals with devotion to dreams, selflessness, and the power of teaching and learning. It's about the eternal hope we all carry to aspire, to achieve, to blossom no matter what ; Billy names our drive to the ultimate of human experience, whatever that may be for you.<br />The DVD comes with a documentary on the making of Billy Elloit, and thankfully, with English subtitles during some scenes where the accent lays on thick for these American ears.<br />Don't miss this one.
B0000025L0|5.0|1976 was an extraordinary year for jazz-rock, and a very fortunate year for the CBS label.  Weather Report's Jaco Pastorius released his wonderful debut solo album, Stanley Clarke released 'Schooldays', and his band Return to Forever released their 'Romantic Warrior' masterpiece.<br />It's useful to compare the two bassists' approaches to solo albums.  Pastorius assumed a solo album meant just that: although there would be some numbers in a group setting, there should also be at least a couple of tracks where bass was the only instrument.  Clarke didn't quite see things that way: his solo albums were more of an opportunity to front numerous different assemblies of highly accomplished musicians.  The only rule, as he saw it, was not to use Lenny White or Al di Meola, or you might as well call the result another Return to Forever album.<br />Here he employs a fantastic roll-call of the leading drummers of the time: Bill Cobham, Eleventh House's Gerry Brown, and ace session musician Steve Gadd.  Corea isn't featured at all, so Clarke himself provides some piano, and Dave Sancious and George Duke provides most of the keyboard fest elsewhere.<br />The album was Clarke's zenith, and his biggest seller.  Sadly there's only one acoustic track here, but the electric tracks, to my ear, haven't dated as badly as those on 'Journey to Love'.  Over the course of 25 years I have played it to death, and feel I know every note!  But this means I cannot forecast how it will sound to new ears.  To me it's still hugely enjoyable.
B00000ILBK|2.0|I have always enjoyed the Star Trek series immensly even though it is not what I would consider great science fiction,  haveing alway felt that they cheat on some of their moral arguments.  But before this movie, this series had been blessed with a form of consistant quality, that makes it easily the best series of its kind.  This movie simply has a terrible plot.  It has more holes than substance, with none of the basic storylines holding up to any kind of coherant thought.  If the movie was more of an action movie they might get away with a little of this, but not here.  <br />      This movie is based on the worst kind of moral absolutism that the TV series sometimes fell into.  The crew desperatly over reacts to every situation so that they and they alone can solve this problem using the brightness of their halos.  Sorry, but instead of thinking that they are these really great people, if I were the federation I would court-martial them for stupidy, which is what the authors of this script should face.

0553208845|5.0|Hesse tells the story of a young man, Siddhartha, who is set on finding enlightenment and thus happiness.  Initially, Siddhartha adheres to the teachings of his father, but after years of meditation and adulation, he was unhappy.  No one had shown him the way to enlightenment.  Set on finding it, he embarks on a new journey, with his friend, Govinda, and joins the Samanas.  After awhile, Siddhartha feels the same discontent.  His teachers, the Samanas, still have not shown him the way to enlightenment, and at this point, he parts with his friend and teachers and attempts to live the life of ordinary people.  Although, at first, Siddhartha learns a great deal about business and the art of lovemaking, he again becomes bored and unhappy.  He is caught in Samsara, the ways of the world, and once he realizes this, he is disgusted with himself.  He leaves all of his riches behind and commences a new journey.<br />  The book is a treat to read.  In addition, it has profound wisdom to impart to the reader.  In a sense, a revolutionary message permeates the book; this message goes hand and hand with Siddhartha's desire to find enlightenment.  Every time Siddhartha attempts to gain enlightenment by following the paths of others, he fails.  At one point, he says, \\"No, a true seeker could not accept any teachings, not if he sincerely wished to find something.\\"  The message it sends to the reader is that one can only find enlightenment by listening to the wisdom deep within one.  The teachings of others will not necessarily help one achieve true happiness because, according to Siddhartha, \\"wisdom is not communicable.\\" For instance, Siddhartha believed that the illustrious Gotama, the Buddha, achieved enlightenment, while the followers of Buddha, such as Govinda, may never find it by adhering to the Buddha's teachings.  Nevertheless, although Siddhartha's path was arduous, he eventually attained enlightenment by listening to himself and to the wisdom of nature.
B00000BKDZ|1.0|A friend said this album was &quot;incredible&quot;. Yeah right! I was eager when listening to sound samples, so I checked it out. The first thing I heard was this PINK FLOYD-type ballad and I'm thinking to myself &quot;This is the same band that did 'Run To The Hills'?????????? No way!&quot; I always listen to sound samples before buying an album, so I can know what to expect. If you are new to MAIDEN, I would recommend &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;, &quot;Killers&quot;, &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot;, &quot;Piece Of Mind, or &quot;Powerslave&quot;. But not this!
0060930187|5.0|I heard about The Bell Jar from amazon.com and all the reviews seemed to be fairly well so I went out and bought it.  From the very beginning I loved Esther.  If you're openminded, you can connect with her on this strange level.  Sometimes you want to reach out to her and tell her it will be alright.  A woman with everything she has has no reason to be depressed.  But that's one of my favorite things about the book.  Unlike others she doesn't become depressed over a man or a lost loved one, it's just something that happens to her, and even she can't figure it out.<br />At the beginning Esther is a brilliant young college student with great determination.  However something, and there seems to be no explination for it, causes her to become depressed.  Over and over she talks about &quot;being her old self again.&quot;  She goes through many institutions and a few shock treatments after attempted suicide before the &quot;bell jar&quot; is lifted from her head.    <br />I love the way she describes her thoughts.  I love the way she reacts to Buddy Willard and the way she stands up for herself to men unlike alot of women.  I love everything about Esther, and I think you will too.  <br />Words cannot describe this book as mine seem far from it.  Esther almost seems to come alive in this book.
B00000I14Z|4.0|This is pure 1950s Jazz, the kind that makes you feel like a filterless cigarette might be a good idea.<br />The playing is flawless, the recording sterling, the swing endless.<br />If I have one complaint here, it is Mingus's bass being hidden in a forest of other superb players.  The first few bars of the record, just Mingus on bass, then piano, then horns and the rest, had me eager for a bass-heavy experience.  It's all great stuff, but I wanted to hear the standup.<br />This is a classic that any Jazz fan should own.
0060278234|5.0|It had everything about information that was announced, but not elaborated in the first. Sabriel circled around the basic knowledge of the Old Kingdom and the differences between it and Ancelstierre. Lirael brances off the information given in the first and joins the North and the South. There are many perils still putting the two in danger. They are not joined and still has the Wall dividing them, but the relationships between the governing offices have greatly improved. The magic of the Old Kingdom isn't as unstable and the Charter returned to its original greatness. The experiances that the characters take part in are exceptional. Garth Nix captures the voices of the characters to what would be expected, and then slowly changes them into who they are and what they are destined for. The new characters and the old coexist with an understanding of not knowing their true identities. The ending will blow you away. There are twists and turns the story line takes that confuse you and get you back on track. A must read for any fan of mystics and magic.
B000056K04|3.0|I have been a Dave fan since 1994.  His music and lyrics have progression and impressive development that I have admired.  I don't get that feeling in this production.  Though there is some spontaneity in the When the World Ends and there is some world beat in the cut Mother/father, the rest of the album is average. I miss the impromptu sounds of the early studio work and, of course, the live recordings.  This album proves that Westcoast radio-focused producer Ballard doesn't get IT.  Dave Matthews Band is best when they let the music flow together, not pre-package it.  The band has made it BIG with it's real interaction with the crowds this album does not have that feeling.  What a disappointment.
0684874350|5.0|This book offers real insight into the poverty and life of those in Limerick during Frankie's childhood and of the sadness and grief he and his family must have endured in those days.  The loss of life, alcohol addiction, evictions, loneliness, and solitude are ever present in this work---along with the struggle to overcome and leave the ugliness behind.<br />Frank's words filled my heart with sadness and at times with joy.  I found this work to be incredibly enjoyable!  It is a MUST read.

B000002AP1|4.0|I finally got around to picking up this, the remastered version of Raw Power, after so many years of procrastination;  most of my favourite bands swore by it, and I bought everything else EXCEPT for this album.  I figured that it would always be around.<br />Listening to it now, it's amazing that it got released in the first place, given it's inaccessibility (but somehow timelessly buried pop sensibilities) at that point in time.  I'd read &quot;Please Kill Me&quot; by Legs MacNeil, and it piqued my curiosity enough to finally pick it up.  I wasn't disappointed in the slightest, even though I usually am when it comes to critical favourites.<br />&quot;Search and Destroy&quot;, &quot;Your Face is Going to Hell&quot;, and the title cut are searing punk before punk became front-page news.  Harder and less dynamic than other alumni of the Detroit school of music (MC5), but no less affecting.  &quot;Gimme Danger&quot; is the best song Jim Morrison never wrote, and &quot;Penetration&quot; ... well, I can't complain about any tune on the album, really.<br />The best punk albums of the seventies were basically riff-dominated rock 'n' roll, and this one is no exception--it ranks up there with &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;, the Dolls' first album, Wayne/Jayne County's &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Cleopatra&quot;, and nobody's record collection is complete without it.

B000002KIE|5.0|What can be said about the punk-rock forefathers that hasn't already been said? Loud, obnoxious, foul-mouhthed...inspirational, influential, undisputed. You don't own this album?

B00002MZ4W|5.0|Child Prodigy Fiona Apple is truly gifted. Period. The singer/songwriter/pianist whose given fellow female alt rockers like Liz Phair and PJ Harvey a lot of competition,is known for her incredible tickling of ivories and even more incredible venomous tongue. From her soft-porn romp in her 1997 &quot;Criminal&quot; video to her sharp reprimanding speech at the following MTV Video Music Awards, Apple has wormed her way into the now overun-by-pop music world. When The Pawn is an incredible album, even more so than Tidal. Behind the world's longest album title, Fiona is on fire. &quot;On The Bound&quot; is as powerful as &quot;Shadowboxer&quot;, if not ten times more. &quot;To Your Love&quot; is astounding as well as &quot;Limp&quot; and the confessional &quot;Mistake&quot;, where she growls &quot;..If you wanna make sense, whatch lookin at me for? Im no good at math&quot; is even more revealing as &quot;Criminal&quot; in all its take it or leave it attitude. &quot;Love Ridden&quot; is truly open and beautiful. The first single &quot;Fast As You Can&quot; is a jittering, hyperactive number that is new for Apple's usual melancholy. However it works because of its great lyrics and refreshing experimental approach. &quot;Paper Bag&quot; is a good song, but I would not have chosen it as a single. When The Pawn is every artists study guide for a sophomore album. Okay class, study this one hard.
B0000028M7|5.0|It's hard to say which AIC album is the best, but this one is probably the most popular.  This album does contain one of the best songs ever made in &quot;Would?&quot;.  &quot;Would?&quot; contains all of the elements that AIC has brought to the music world.  Smooth harmonies, pounding rock riffs, and eerie yet soothing vocals.  The album itself starts off with a bang when you push play and hear Staley screaming, which is then followed up by powerful guitar riffs on the song, &quot;Them Bones&quot;.  &quot;Damn That River&quot; also gives a good punch of metal.  &quot;Dirt&quot; is smooth and dark and &quot;Angry Chair&quot; keeps the darkness but adds even darker and harder guitar riffs and vocal sounds. This is definitely a must-have album for anyone who likes hard rock/heavy metal.
B00004TBWR|5.0|I recently replaced all my previous versions of this and all CCR's recordings (with the exception of Mardi Gras) with the remastered versions.  The sound quality is greatly improved over the previous version of this and all their studio recordings.  <br />As for the recording itself, this is a classic.  All the songs are excellent, including the  instrumentals.  The songs flow together nicely from one song to the next, making it a  complete listening experience.

Unfortunately, the wording of the song titles, band members names, &amp; other notes, on this, and all their studio releases is TOO DAMN LARGE!

The back covers on the &quot;Green River&quot; &amp; &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot; releases is  practically ruined because of this.  Also, the wording on the back covers of all the new remastered studio  releases is exactly the same size, which tells me that the record label is being cheap once again.  Maybe  they'll get it right on the next release of these classic recordings.<br />As for the liner notes, on this and other releases, I would have preferred to hear comments from the  band members, instead of music critics, or at least a combination of the two.  However, this probably  isn't possible due to the bad blood between Fogerty and his former band mates &amp; record label.  However,  I don't need to hear some music critic's opinion of what &quot;innate good taste&quot; in music is.  Ed Ward's review  of &quot;Willy &amp; The Poorboys&quot; puts down the group Yes, and for that matter the whole &quot;progressive&quot; rock music  scene.  I think this is highly unfair, since both groups work in different musical areas.  I happen to think  both groups were great at what they did.  They made great recordings in their heyday and have both  stood the test of time.  Isn't that what justifies what great music should be?
B00003CWTI|3.0|Magnolia is a strange movie.  We learn about all sorts of different characters, who all have all sorts of problems.  The beginning was wayyyy confusing, because everything went so fast!  But things slowed down.  Another disadvantage, all throughout the movie, we keep flashing by every scene as they're left off the last time we saw them.  Chaos.  But not everything is bad.  There are good performances by Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore.  The acting is great by everyone.  There are some funny moments.Most of this film is depressing.  NOTE:  There is no MAGNOLIA!!!  (Why'd they call it that?!).  The surprise climax is quite breathtaking (and somewhat humorous).  I recommend this DVD if you rented it and you liked it, but not for any other reason, besides the extra features on the bonus disc.

0553278223|5.0|The stories compiled in this collection chronicle the imaginary history of a series of rocket flights to Mars.  Encounters with the Martians range in nature from the mystical to the fearful, and sometimes include a tincture of both elements.  As a few other reviewers have pointed out, there are constant echoes of the story of white, European settlers of America and their encounters with the Native Americans.  You should try to remember that, and watch for examples of it, while reading these stories.  Be aware that college students in many other countries are given these stories to read by professors, in classes on American literature, as examples of the way American writers turn the Native American experience into fiction.<br />Most of these stories, as I said, are drawn from the Native American experience.  Here, I will mention a couple of exceptions, which are also great reading.  &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot; is one of my favorite stories, not only because it has such a neat title, but because it has a number of incredibly beautiful images, and prompts the reader to really think hard about man's chances for survival.  Another one of my favorites is...  I cannot recall the title, but it concerns a lost, telepathic Martian who stumbles into a town of humans.  He instantly, physically transforms into a look-alike facsimile of whomever the people he is near are thinking of -- a lost child, a dead son, etc.  You really feel for him as he morphs through various identities.  He is like a puppet on a million strings, with ten thousand warring puppeteers pulling him hither and yon, until his very mind undergoes a horrifyingly apocalyptic meltdown.  Cool to read about, but it doesn't sound like a very fun thing to actually experience, to put it mildly.<br />This slim book is one of the most beloved additions to... not only to the genre of science fiction, but to American literature as a whole.  Ray Bradbury personally, in interviews, constantly questions whether he should be considered a &quot;science fiction writer.&quot;  If you stop and think about it, this book will make you see what he means.  He includes rockets, Mars, etc. in these stories, but they often feel more like Edgar Allen Poe or Wallace Stegner than Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke.  The latter two writers I just mentioned, along with many others, have often called Bradbury a &quot;prose poet&quot; -- without rhyming his words, he makes you feel like you are reading poetry.  This, I hasten to mention, is a pretty darned cool trick, if you can do it.<br />I can't say enough good things about this book.  Very worth it.  Please scope it out.
B000031EGV|1.0|I can never believe that an adult would like this crap!!! Robin Williams is a good actor and he did a good job in acting but... this movie is very poor and cheap!<br />The animation is extremely poor and any viewer eye could see how poor it is plus the story events are very childish!<br />Maybe the story is not that bad but the way it has been put together makes it no better than its poor animation.<br />I recommend this movie to little kids but absolutely NOT FOR ADULTS!
B0000019PA|5.0|The concept behind this concept album...  Many mention that it is based on The Diary of Anne Frank, and WWII, and more specifically Mangum's reactions to these.  I have another.  You know how people who have had near death experiences often say &quot;I drifted into a white light&quot; and &quot;my whole life flashed before me&quot; and &quot;I was outside my body looking down on my body and all the doctors in the emergency room&quot; - now we have &quot;I was in the aeroplane over the sea&quot;.
6303402348|5.0|I'm not usually the type of person to cry over a movie, but I was literally sobbing throughout Forrest Gump! The makers of this movie seemed to compile the most heart-breaking aspects of life and put it into one movie.  But what really got to me was how Forrest always tried to be honest and always seemed to keep his promises.  And semi-happy endings are the worst!  Why did Jenny, his love interest and best friend, have to die? Grrr. Sorry. It's an extremely touching movie that is really just a bunch of flashbacks of the life of a man who is willing to share his life story with anyone who cares to listen.  Tom Hanks portrays this character remarkably, he gets you caught up in the story as if you're a part of all that goes on.  The special effects are amazing also, it's so realistic! With memorable quotes (&quot;Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you're gonna get.&quot; &quot;Stupid is as stupid does&quot;) and many Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Actor), I recommend Forrest Gump to anyone and everyone.  Just keep a box of tissues handy, you'll probably need them.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Arggghhh... I look at this face & see evil. A baby girl who teaches 10-year-old girls to feel good with their body & then fills her front with silicon. A baby who is so-called \\"Catholic&#8221; & smokes & drink before 21.  A baby who is so-called &#8220;A virgin&#8221; & dresses like a tramp. A baby who is so-called &#8220;Mommy&#8217;s best friend&#8221; & a &#8220;Innocent school-girl&#8221; & then curses like a Harlem prostitute&#8230; do you want the whole list? It&#8217;s very long. Anyway, this spice-girl wannabe decided to call her second album in a very weird name: Oops&#8230;! I Did It Again!!!. You sure did! I think that I&#8217;ve never seen such an awful work since Backstreet Boys&#8217; &#8220;Millenium&#8221;. Under normal circumstances, I would not touch this lame excuse to an album even with a Pooper-Scooper, but as an objective girl, I decided to give it a chance&#8230; & I truly regret this moment! This piece of crap is maybe more worst than the first one. I gave it one star, but if I could- I would give it nothing. A zero. I hate all of the &#8220;song&#8221; (Oops, Lucky, Stronger) & all of the &#8220;ballads&#8221; (Don&#8217;t Let Me Be The Last To Know, Dear Diary). The only refuge is Diane Warren, who stupidly donated a beautiful song to this un-talented silicon. A good tip: DON&#8217;T BUY IT. DON&#8217;T WASET A CENT ON THIS WASET OF A CD.
B00003CWL6|5.0|From the outset this is the story about the urban family, white picket fence, working parents, nice house. As the movie progresses you become increasing aware that nothing could be further from the truth. A fascinating look at responsibility and discovery of what is really important in life. Its dark and very real but has a remarkably uplifting ending. I would rate this movie as one of (if not the) best movies of the year.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|i think that this compilation of his finest hits displays to people a great deal of talent and well put together songs, but I don't think that it has all that Jini Hendrix had to offer.  I still think that it is a great buy, but I also urge anyone who buys this CD and likes it to buy another one of his original albums like South Saturn Delta or Are you Experienced, this shows more what he was all about past a sort of commercial sense.  But if all you're looking for is his greatest hits, than you have definately come to the right place.
B00003W8NM|5.0|First off, do not watch this film if someone has explained the ending. Its a gritty, violent cut of the life of a middle of the road 'suit'. The story will blow your mind and the philosophy is amazing. This is one movie you must see.
B00004ZDOQ|2.0|I have been a limp fan since 1998 and after going to see them at WOODSTOCK 99 everyone that went thought they were one of the best bands of their time, and after listening to this new CD it puts Bizkit to shame, but after seeing them live where they played songs from CSATHFW and they sounded quite good and i think even though people put them down cause they brought out a bad album you realy have to see them in concert.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This is a 'true story'... but the seamen were English, not American. The story is overblown, over dramatised and fairly forgettable. No stand out performances, special effects are ok, but lack any new material. Its the same old hollywood story under the pretense of truth. If you want ot see a good submarine movie buy Crimson Tide.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Well it's another Limp Bizkit Album after buying the first two i was very excited about this album, I thought the album was poor conpared to Three dollar Bills & Significant Other, There are some good songs but Fred & Co. can do so much better, i think that Limp are trying to apeal to a wider audience, Selling out has lost Limp the respect that they had from the long time alterative music fans, i go to quite a few limp concerts and Limp have the heaviest Mosh pitts i have ever been to. They used to be cool but i went recently to a gig and the place was full of little kids running around in Red hats and wearing limp hoodies. they stand in the crowd and when Limp kick off and the Mosh starts they get messed up and every one has to watch out for them and pick them up, and when Limp play songs like Pollution which the moderen fans dont know they boo cause Durst doesnt swear every 5 seconds, i have been a limp fan since 1997 when they were unknown and it gets to me when these wannabe fans hear one song (Rollin) which is rubish anyway and they think that they are Rock dudes. I'm sorry to say that this album is just poor and i hope that Limp don't go down the same road which Matallica have gone. Also Limp need to get rid of those stupid Rap/HipHop songs, as Hiphop songs go they are not that bad but what are they doing on a NuMetal album? I Just hope that the up and coming forth album is going to go back to the Three dollar bills type thing. If you like Rollin you will like the album but the only good songs on the album are: Take A Look Around, My Generation (The music is brilliant especialy the druming, but the lyrics are abit dodgy) & My Way. The Best thing about this album though is JOHN OTTO'S drumming & DJ Letal Scratching they make the album and without them, the album would be a very big Flop.
6300182770|3.0|...which are ultimately more interesting in theory than execution with &quot;Videodrome,&quot; a grisly, imaginative comment on television's influence over the public.<br />Max Renn (James Woods, who blends discomfort, confusion, and sleaze very well) is the president of Civic TV, an independent Canadian outfit that specializes in &quot;everything from soft-core pornography to hard-core violence,&quot; and when he comes across a pirated satellite feed of a new program called &quot;Videodrome&quot; (just people being tortured and murdered), he can't take his eyes off it.  Renn is matched in madness by Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry, of Blondie), a spacey, new-age radio personality with an appetite for physical pain.  After a series of hallucinations and strange bodily transformations (stomachs develop vaginal openings to accept videotapes, of course), Renn is introduced to Barry Convex (Les Carlson, whose excellent, villainous performance is one of the movie's highlights), an eyeglass manufacturer who happens to be the mastermind--or at least ONE of the masterminds--behind the sinister &quot;Videodrome&quot; program.<br />There are a lot of positive aspects to be extracted from this movie, and being a huge fan of Cronenberg I was expecting to be as enthusiastic as everyone else about this one.  But even after watching it countless times, &quot;Videodrome&quot;--while ingeniously crafted--still tends to leave me feeling shut out after it's all over.  The movie simply isn't as involving as &quot;The Dead Zone,&quot; &quot;Shivers,&quot; or &quot;eXistenZ,&quot; and I have no idea why.  Cronenberg's specialty may be icy characters in strange predicaments, but this is the first instance where I was left cold by the proceedings.<br />On the positive side, &quot;Videodrome&quot; IS a bit of a sly satire on television that's still relevant today.  How much viewing does it take before someone's reality becomes television (as one character asks)?  It also shows--maybe subconsciously--the link between watching violence and having it carry over into reality (i.e.--Renn becomes a mind-controlled assassin for Videodrome).  Cronenberg's script is stuffed with issues of social and political importance, so much that it takes a few viewings to completely observe his intentions (the mark of a good film).<br />But maybe the true stars of &quot;Videodrome&quot; are Rick Baker's rushed but efficient special effects, which present some of the most nauseatingly gory images ever committed to celluloid.  The aforementioned vaginal openings, videotapes made from flesh, guns grafting themselves onto hands, and bodies turning themselves inside out are just a few things to look out for.<br />David Cronenberg is one of the most talented directors working today, and &quot;Videodrome&quot; IS a good movie, but--in my humble opinion--it's not the best he's put out.ously--the link between watching violence and having it carry over into reality (i.e.--Renn becomes a mind-controlled assassin for Videodrome).

B00004XOWM|3.0|The new album does have some good tunes with catchy scratch beats in places but i think it is just a remake of Significant Other, Durst and co. have just gone down hill from Three Dollar Bills, when they where heavy, Selling out was the worst thing that Bizkit could have done, yes more people buy their cds but they have lost the respect of the long term fans of alternative music, at Limp concerts now little kids always get messed up in the mosh and they have to hospital and then Bizkit get the blame, also every kid now has one of those red caps, yes i use to wear one years ago but not anymore!. There are a few good songs on the album but i would recomend Three dollar bills or Significant Other, Don't get me wrong i have been a fan of Limp since 1998 when they were unknown and i am still a fan i just hope the new forth album will be back to what they used to be like.
0790729628|4.0|Bladerunner: The Directors Cut can lay claim to this. It is has the brilliant visuals which you'd normally expect from director Ridley Scott combined with an excellent soundtrack by Vangelis. Good script, acting and special effects.<br />This 'Cut' of the film is more in the way of what the director intended it to be as opposed to what the executives/studios wanted. The narration and 'happy ending' that spoilt the original release have thankfully been removed. This makes for a more intelligent and thought provoking film.<br />This DVD release is good. Picture quality is fine, but could be better. Audio - Dolby Digital 2.0 - does the job. It does lack the extras that you'd expect from many new releases these days, but with a film this good extras aren't that important.
B000002P5W|5.0|The musical genius at a pivotal point in his career.  Jimi Hendrix long ago proved to the world his genius with &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; and anyone who questioned that genius had to only listen to the follow up to that album.<br />Axis: Bold as Love is a fantastic album, and definetely on my top ten list of fave albums.  It's behind Electric Ladyland, but it equals AYE.  However, AYE and ABAL are vastly different albums.  Where AYE focuses on distorted guitars and heavy tracks, Axis focuses on the more spiritual, beautiful and surreal side of Jimi.<br />With any other band I'd choose the distorted guitars, but what makes the difference is the intensely beautiful and poetic lyrics that echo from the mouth of Jimi.  As well, the album still mantains the same fury as AYE, only in a different manner.  While AYE was rock 'n' roll, Axis was much more of an experiment in blending the styles of blues, folk, rock, soul and just about every other music form out there.  With most artists, a blend like this would often be difficult to listen to, but Jimi has a way to make the tracks move almost seamlessly.  However, in the vein of blending styles, Axis is outdone by it's respective follow up &quot;Electric Ladyland.&quot;<br />Each track is as listenable as the others, there are no real stand-out tracks, because Hendrix concentrated on creating an album, not one single and filler, like a lot of bands out there today.<br />The oft imitated, rarely duplicated guitar work remains, but it isn't put as far forward in the mix as the other two albums.  It seems almost an afterthought when you take into account all of the beatiful lyrics throughout the record.  However, it is still fantastic, and ingenious as it ever was.  Especially on songs like &quot;Little Wing,&quot; and my personal fave &quot;Castles Made Of Sand&quot; the guitar is particularly beautiful, adding to the overall texture and mood of the record.<br />This record is often missed by record-buyers because of the two albums the respectively preceded and followed it, but it remains a fantastically written, well-thought out experience that remains true to this day.  It almost feels as if it was recorded yesterday.  If you don't have this album, I say &quot;buy it right now!&quot;  It is probably one of the five best in my 90 CD collection, which is a compliment, since it's being placed beside such classics as Led Zeppelin IV and Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon.<br />If I was allowed to have one complaint about this album, it would be the length.  Because Ladyland was my first album I became accustomed to 8 and 12 minute tracks.  The 2-5 minute vein in song lengths is somewhat hard for me to adjust to.  The fact that the album clocks in at under 45 minutes is a dissapointment, although I'd hardly expect someone to be able to write that much material at that high of a quality.  I guess that's Jimi for you...
B000002UVZ|5.0|This, I think, is REM's finest album, even better than Automatic For The People, which has been my favourite for years until I bought this. Everything comes together, its musically and lyrically rich but still has 'oomph!' to it, as some would say. From the anthemic rocker 'Begin the Begin' or whatever its called to the haunting 'swan swan H' I'm still refreshed no matter how many times I listen to it. There are 2 outright beauties in there - 'Cuyahoga'and 'Hyena', with other tracks 'Fall on Me' 'Flowers of Guatemala' 'These Days' and 'Believe' confirming REM's status as today's best songwriters.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall, while not being on par with such Pink Floyd classics as Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, is still a beautifully and masterfully written and recorded record.  Like DSOTM, the Wall is more of a concept album than a collection of singles.  Songs lead into eachother, and when the entire project comes together, you get at least a small sense of a story in your mind (that is if you are capable of paying attention to the lyrics throughout).  For those who don't know, the basic idea is of a musician who builds a wall around himself to keep from being hurt, both physically and emotionally.  At least, that's a very outline of the idea.  Basically, it appears the story travels through the artists chjildhood, through to his prominence as a performer, and the point where it would appear (judging by lyrical content) goes crazy as a loon.<br />Despite the mildly disturbing subject matter, the album retains so much integrity and beauty throughout.  Only during the last three tracks does this coherence start to waver, with tracks that are quite operatic in nature.  Maybe for some, but those last couple tracks can be a pain for me to listen to depending on the mood I'm in.<br />The lyrics, as already mentioned, are quite descriptive and beautiful, always adding to the story, and rarely, if ever taking away.  The backing keyboards on many tracks add to the story as well, and Doug Gilmour's guitar playing is on par with any of his other works.  Fantastic use of soloing methods keeps the album fresh throughout.<br />Definetely not the band's best, but close to the top (check Dark Side for the best of PF), and definetely worth picking up if you are curious about the band.  It provides some insight into the band's tyle of storylike albums that can then be used to appreciate some of the other records.<br />Mostly great tracks, a few fantastic one, and about two that get a little tedious towards the end of the record.  But match that with any album out today, and youare likely to find maybe half of the album listenable...<br />If you are still reading this review, STOP!  There is no point in reading any further.  Ignore the bad reviews and recognize them as the ravings of someone who just doesn't have the intelligence to &quot;get it&quot; and &quot;appreciate it.&quot;  If you are a person who feels music rather than just listening to it, buy The Wall now.  There's no point in not doing it..  For those of you who need a catchy riff and cuss words, go buy some Limp Bizkit, and stay away from the intelligent stuff...
B000002TPS|5.0|Youthanasia is noticably different from earlier Megadeth releases. However this does not make the album bad. Most early Megadeth fans say that this is a selout.I disagree.I like early Megadeth and I like this also. I like it when bands change there style.I am glad that every one of Megadeth's albums do not sound exatly the same. I strongly recomend this album to metal fans. It is a masterpiece.
B00005A1PR|3.0|I'd heard of India Arie when I used to live in Atlanta.  I always thought she had a solid voice and its good to see that the album is getting some pub.  Unfortunately, after listening to it I'm a bit disappointed.  The production in the album is a tad weak with played out samples and predicatable instrumentals. I swear I predicted the exact chord changes on a number of the tracks.  It will sell just by riding out the &quot;neo-soul&quot; wave with Musiq, Erykah and the like.  Its just unfortunate that it couldn't be a bit more inventive
0451450523|5.0|This is an amazing novel if you love unicorns and the magic they embody.  If you like this novel, the movie is a must see - it sticks very close to the story line.  Although it was made in 1982, it is still a wonderful movie for people of all ages.  I recomend both the book and the movie to all unicorn-fanatics!
B000002BMV|5.0|This audio recording is excellent.  &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot; has been my favorite song ever since I heard it once on the radio.  I became obsessed.  Yes, I am a teenager, and I am not &quot;supposed&quot; to like 80's music, but my good friend and I both agree that this song is an exception.  It has a catchy beat, words you can (for the most part) understand, unlike most rap and rock songs of today.  <br />I also love &quot;Who's Crying Now.&quot;  It is slower, but still catchy and overall a very good song.<br />I must admit, however, that in my obsession over &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot; I haven't paid much attention to the other songs on the CD.  <br />The final verdict is :  Buy this CD.  Listen to &quot;DON'T STOP BELEIVIN'&quot; a couple times, and let yourself fall into ecstasy. You will love it whether you are 7 years old or 700 years old.  It is loved ny all ages.  Thank you and please buy this cd.
B000002B7M|4.0|While many feel this is Ozzy's finest release, I find the follow up &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; more rounded and sophisticated.  Not that this '79 release did'nt have it's moments.  Osbourne's songwriting and vocals are much improved if not over the top. But the driving force here is the stunning musicianship of unknown guitarist Randy Rhodes.  While many proclaimed Rhodes just another Eddie Van Halen clone, they were just being willful. Rhodes brillant single string playing is required study for any aspiring guitarist and the mindfull attention to detail displayed throughout all the tracks shows just how complete a musician he was. <br />It's no mystery that transition periods often  produce superior performances and this release proves that.   While an uneven recording, &quot;Crazy Train&quot; and &quot;I Dont Know&quot; are still in heavy rotation today and fine examples of Ozzy Osbourne at his best.
6303566448|5.0|Anchor Bay is rereleasing this film in 2002. So those of us who have been without one of the best Horror/Comdies will have a chance to purchase it. That is all.
B000002GJ7|5.0|This coming of age release turns out to be one of the finset release of the 90's. Hyperbole aside, few CD's in the last ten years hold up as well as this one. Imagine a concept album with humor,wit, and some serious musicianship.  This '92 release showcases the band sucessfully integrating the diverent musical styles of Van Halen, Queen, Aerosmith, and Boston into one effusive sledgehamering musical force.  <br />While they'd disolve a few years later, with lead singer Cherone joining Van Halen, Extreme remains one of the most underrated and underappreciated bands of the 90's (mostly thanks to a Seattle musicial movement heralded by Kurt Cobain).<br />Throughout &quot;Pornographitti&quot; Nuno Bettencourt displays a wide variety of chops most guitar players are still trying to decifer.  A remarkable rhythm pulsates through many of the tracks here, while not quite funk its close enuff.
6303921248|5.0|I'm a huge Jane Austen fan, both book and movie versions of her work.  My two favorite movies are Emma and Sense and Sensibility, which are sweet and romantic but not necessarily true to the book.  This movie surpasses both of them! I watched it twice, then the next day I watched certain scenes, and then the whole thing again! It's that good.<br />I could repeat the same praise other readers have shared, because the characters are perfectly right, the settings and costumes are lush and the script is just a delight.  I especially liked the embarrassing, fickle Mrs. Bennett and the bowing, stupid Mr. Collins.  Every sister was instantly recognizable as someone you knew! Lydia was well done as a giggling, boy-crazy apple-of-her-mother's-eye. And Mr. Bennet had the best wry sense of humour. He was teasing his high-strung wife constantly, but it went over her head every time.<br />But the best part of this adaption, I believe, was the tender way the director allowed the story to unfold, slowly.  There were whole dances, not just 10 seconds.  The sexual tension of the Lizzy-Darcy relationship was brought out carefully.  At first I didn't like Darcy at all.  It was only through a series of conversations, lingering looks, even flashbacks, that the main characters' hearts were revealed. I think the casting director picked these two gems (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) not just for their acting but also because of their (&quot;fine&quot;) eyes...demure and curious in Elizabeth, brooding and expressive in Darcy. In the end I'd fallen in love with both of them myself!<br />A second viewing showed details you won't get with a 2 hour movie.  For example, Darcy makes a passing remark about well-read women (as a small compliment to Lizzy, who's of course a bookworm).  In a few minutes, the snobbish Caroline Lucas is seen parading around in front of the group, trying in vain to get interested in a book in her hands.  Finally she throws it aside and goes back to her favorite past-time, cutting people down. Excellently done!<br />The 6 hours will just fly by!  Have an Austen-a-thon this week-end and put this in line as the finale.
B000059XUO|4.0|I just finished viewing the 2 DVD set of The Crow Collectors Edition.  Everything about this set is better from the versions that were previously available to fans.  The sound and picture are phenomenal, and the extras, like the extended footage feature, the behind-the-scene featurette, and the deleted scene montage is extra icing on this cake.  However, the sad thing about this set, one that we have been waiting 7 years for already, is that the last interview given by Brandon Lee before his death WAS NOT included.  I was quite saddened when I realized that this had not been included.  Often imitated, never duplicated ... Brandon Lee was The Crow.<br />Two more things that were left out that could only have made this set better is a directors commentary, and most of the Skull Cowboy scenes that were deleted from the movie.<br />Who knows why movie companies do things the way they do.  I guess we will have to wait for the next bigger and better release of The Crow on DVD to find out if they finally get it right.  But for now, the Collectors Edition will do just fine.
B00004VXF2|4.0|From the moment I heard of the album's existance, I knew somehow I had to listen to it.  It took me a few months to find a copy, but I never regretted buying it.  Years before 'power noise' became an accepable offshoot of industrial and hardcore, and Sonic Youth pushed the capabilities of the guitar to it's limit, Lou Reed laid the foundation stone for every noisemonger who was to follow.  <br />So why not 5 stars for such an influential album?  Well - there's not a lot ELSE going on here.  Sure - you can put it on and get lost in your own world, but I'm sure Lou Reed could have put some extra 'details' in here, just to give it a bit more variety.  But that's a minor point.  Don't think of it as part of Lou's discography, it's not even nearly related to anything else he's done.  This album stands alone in music history.
0141301120|4.0|I am reading this book, and I haven't finished it but, it's great!  It's amazing the mind of Roald Dahl...The characters are so realistic!  You must pick up this book.  But I think that if you read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or just watch the movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory, it will be a bit clearer.
B000059QYB|3.0|Shame on you Bill for leaving out , &quot; Prodigal Son &quot;....perhaps you may have reasons.....Still...the CD is one shy of complete...<br />ciao,
0780627024|5.0|This movie is great on many levels.  For a baby-boomer like me who remembers the fifties it reminds me of growing up and watching the &quot;crazy&quot; teenagers in my neighborhood. If that's all you get out of the movie it satisfies. As a high school student in the sixties it reminds me of the major cultural and economic shift that occurred.  If you graduated from high school in the mid-sixties you know what I'm talking about.  And, if you lived in the northeastern U.S. and came from a diverse community, you remember that changes that occurred from 1962 on.  While some of it was painful, it was also liberating and I learned a lot about myself, about people not like me, and and about people who I thought were like me--members of white, lower-middle class (or was it upper-lower class?)  <br />The subtext is on point and I am always blown away when the character, named not too subtlely &quot;Whitey&quot; describes Margaret as a &quot;coloured&quot; girl. I've made sure my teenagers have seen the movie, but doubt the reading theme which I love, hits them the way it hits me. Most of all it provides memories--too many to recount here, like the screen when the TV was off, and the &quot;fifties&quot; women with heels and aprons.  I never saw anyone's mother dressed like that!<br />Enough said, just buy or rent and enjoy.<br />It's a beautiful movie.
B000002N2N|5.0|If you enjoy live shows, and you love the Ramones, this is an album you'll want to have in your Ramones library.  Not only do the Ramones sound good--they sound like the Ramones, but the songs consist of their early material, which captures the Ramones in their true element.  This has always been one of the best Ramones albums--don't miss out on it, especially since you'll never see them live again...
B00005ABX0|4.0|Here's a two-fer that's one of the strangest in their whole catalog.<br />After all the hype that was built up for &quot;Smile&quot; and the Beatles &quot;Pet Sounds vol. 2&quot; er, I mean &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; (boy did I upset the apple cart now), and pressure from the group (read Mike Love) to produce more commercially viable material, it shouldn't be a surprise that Brian Wilson withdrawing from the confines of the studio, the one place where he was truly in his element.<br />You can read more information about that in David Leaf's excellent liner notes.<br />These two albums tell the story how Brian dealt with the conflicts in the group. Both albums carry the credit &quot;Produced by The Beach Boys&quot;. Far from being a disaster discribed by the press, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; actually stands as a good art rock album, without going into the excesses other groups blissful bombarded to death. In fact, some of the biggest fans of the album come from the rock community, Pete Townshend from The Who among them (check out the liner notes from his demo double album &quot;Scoop&quot; if you don't believe me). It's defenitely an interesting listen.<br />Coming from almost the opposite end of the spetrum &quot;Wild Honey&quot; shows their R&amp;B influence well, something you wouldn't think possible coming from The Beach Boys. All songs carry the Brian Wilson/Mike Love credits, with the exception of &quot;how She Boogalooed It&quot; credited to Mike, Al, Bruce, and Carl. Brian didn't exactly leave the group here. <br />Recommended if you're interested hearing their &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; follow up(s).
B00004XMTJ|4.0|I liked this dvd, but I saw the Broadway cast perform this, and the very best part was Growltiger - what happened to that scene in the DVD??  I can't believe they dropped this very excellent, pivotal act from the movie!!!
B000002NIW|5.0|I still remember when I first heard these guys, back in the 8th grade. I liked korn back than(I've since moved on), and mtv was doing a special on korn's favorite videos, so I watched it. I remember when they showed the video for \\"Shove it(My Own Summer\\". I was blown away, and they are one of the few bands I liked from back than that I still like.<br /> This is my favorite Deftones album. It's awesome. My favorite songs are \\"My Own Summer(Shove It)\\", \\"Lhabia\\", \\"Mascara\\", and \\"Headup\\", but all the songs are good. In my opinion, this is more polished than their first album, but that is only my opinion. To sum it up, buy this CD, you are getting more than your money's worth.

B00004XQ83|5.0|Grab some lemons and some Jack Daniels and make some Lynchburg Lemonade, pull up a swinging chair, and bring back the tradition of everybody gathering in the hot Southern night...crowded around the band, who subtly plays from the steps.<br />I'll tell you -- it is a great movie and a great soundtrack.  Grab your phillie and do a little hop...<br />Back to my normal, cynical, Northeast perspective...Even for a guy that likes techno and every other kind of esoteric piece of music -- you can't get a way from our roots.  I am part Irish and I look at it this way...this gives to me the same visions of our musical and social roots, as hearing the Chieftains reminds me of a small, cozy Irish pub that is way too small on space, but still has room enough to fit the band, a dartboard, and a couple of kegs of Guinness. (And no I don't drink that much ;) )<br />Plus, I can't get George Cloony out of my head, with the boys and their beards in toe, sining I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow. And yes I do know that George didn't sing it and can't sing like his auntie...<br />So how can you go wrong -- off beat humor, Cloony with an accent from deep Kentucky, Homer and the Odessey, Gulliver, and bluegrass.  If you don't like or get this -- you shouldn't vote in Florida. :)
6305587841|4.0|well done, it might upset some lovers of the original b/c it doesn't always stay true but it is still a good movie that has some amazing effects and some amazing scenes. if only the sequel and other remakes were this good
B000056K04|5.0|The first being Mandella...<br />That being an epic statement in itself...  Dave Matthews continues to expand the realm of music.  He and his band draw you in and do not let go.<br />He is and will always be in the same league of life changing bands like Pearl Jam, the Beatles, or the Stones.  Not necessarily in that order.
B00004XONN|1.0|I have never been so disappointed before, listening to a new album. It's boring and hopeless. I heard that Radiohead is planning for a 'real' album again - then I will try my best to forget this one.
B00004RHZU|5.0|In this debut album, Pink not only displays wonderful Pop/R&amp;B grooves, but strongly encourages individuality, and not to try so hard to &quot;fit it.&quot; She certainly is one lady with attitude and edge!<br />Pink jumps from funky dance tracks like &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; and &quot;Most Girls&quot; to slow, strong vocal songs such as &quot;Stop Falling&quot; and &quot;You Oughta Know.&quot; Pink is a very talented lady not only when it comes to vocals, but she's an excellent dancer and performer.
B000005Z0E|4.0|I really don't understand these so called 2Pac fans. I mean don't u hear the same passion &amp; political side on this album that u heard on &quot;Me against the world&quot;. Songs like &quot;Trapped&quot; &amp; &quot;Violent&quot; talks about racial profile &amp; police brutally that black males still deal with 10 years after this album was release.&quot;If My Homies Calls&quot; can be seen as a pre-&quot;I ain't mad at cha&quot; where Pacs tells his friend no matter what happens 2 u in the future I there for u.&quot;Words of wisdom&quot; is a wake up called 2 the black community on not depending on white people &amp; help yourself &amp; each other. &quot;Brenda got a baby&quot; is the song that made Pac known in the rap world but in my opnion the true gem on this album is &quot;Part time mutha...&quot; where pac take the role of a man who had a one night stand with a girl &amp; now he's a father. There a verse my some unknown girl on the song where she take the role as a female who was molested by her father &amp; her mother took his side &amp; blame's her. I don't know if her verse is true but one thing I know she had one of the best guest appreance I ever heard on a pac song. If u looking for the Thug Life &amp; player's theme on this album u ain't gonna find it this was in my opnion(read the poem book in u see why i believe that) the true side of Pac before the rap game switch &amp; u had 2 either be a tough guy or a player 2 be respected in the game.
B000002TQV|5.0|it's amazing how quick people are to point out that &quot;ok computer&quot; is the greatest album of the 90s.  it's a damn good record, but it isn't even the best radiohead material out there.  &quot;the bends&quot; is better.  yeah, yeah, crazy experimentation is great, especially when it all works out well, but sometimes it's a little excessive and seems forced.  this album is decidedly different from conventional pop-rock, but it never sounds like that was done intentionally.  thom yorke himself admitted that &quot;the bends&quot; dealt with his personal demons or whatever you want to call them - a trait that is not readily apparent in any of the newer albums.  as with poetry, music is always better when it is personal, simply because it's what you know best.  maybe i'm generalizing, but this album has a much more passionate, emotional feel to it, especially in comparison to the intentionally lifeless (in my opinion) &quot;kid a.&quot;  listening to &quot;high &amp; dry&quot;, &quot;fake plastic trees&quot;, and &quot;black star&quot;, that much is evident.  not surprisingly, this is also yorke's best singing.  &quot;planet telex&quot; has a slight psychedelic tinge to it with the reverb on full display, creating a spacey, but intricate sound that is perfect for such an intro.  what follows is a stunning example of balance and beauty.  unlike other bands' sorry attempts to recreate the aura of this album, this is not sappy, mushy pop-rock.  yorke pulls off the cobain-esque trick of spouting out his feelings wholeheartedly, yet the listener immediately makes a deep connection.  as he sings in the record's best song, the loud and energetic &quot;just&quot;, &quot;don't get my sympathy, hanging out the 15th floor.&quot;  that pretty much sums up his take on misplaced sympathy, which instantly ups his credibility throughout the album.  once you realize that, somehow the title track sounds like your life; somehow &quot;my iron lung&quot; is an eerily familiar pictureof your frustrations, even though the song is about radiohead's hatred for &quot;creep.&quot;  somehow, i think that &quot;the bends&quot; will be lost in the shuffle when people mention radiohead twenty years down the road, but that doesn't take anything away from this.  it's easier to enjoy every single song here equally, and it's easier to associate with them as well.  in the end, that is what makes this one of the best and most important rock albums of the 90s.  if you're a fan of u2, travis, or coldplay, this is the only radiohead album that will truly satisfy you.
B000002H33|5.0|This is definetly one of the best albums I've ever heard in my entire life! The whole album consists of excellent songwriting, very solid song construction, great bass by the legendary Cliff Burton, great lead guitar play by Kirk Hammett, great rhythm guitar play by James Hetfield, and impressive drumming by Lars Ulrich. This classic starts off with &quot;Battery&quot;, one of the faster songs on the album, which starts with a short aucustic intro and kicks into the heaviness in one of the best ways I have ever heard. &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; is just as amazing, and is played with great precision, and has a great solo by James. The songwriting is flawless on this song. &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; is the only little flaw on the album, as it gets boring and repetitious after a while. Still, it's a good song. Then comes &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;, a ballad in the vein of &quot;Fade To Black&quot;. It's not as good as &quot;Fade To Black&quot;, but great, nonetheless. The best song, in my opinion, bears the name &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;. It has a great intro, and then kicks into really amazing drumming. The drumming is both fast and precise at the same time, and it makes you think: &quot;How the hell does he do that?!&quot; It really has to be heard to be believed. Lyrically, it's the best Metallica song, period. &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; is slower, the most catchy on the album. &quot;Orion&quot; is a damn good instrumental, and its bass harmonies really shine through. &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; is pure Metallica. Fast and furious. Truly an amazing song, but not as good as &quot;Battery&quot;.   All in all, this is an album you should buy. It is blasphemy not to own this album if you're a metal fan. Not matter what the hit list crow tells you, this is Metallica's best album ever. One last tip: Stay the hell away from anything Metallica has released in the 90's, especially &quot;Reload&quot;.
B000002INR|2.0|don't let my rating scare you off.  skid row was a very good band.  problem is, this album isn't.  yes, i know, there are the absolutely essential 80s hits: the disarmingly simple but memorable &quot;i remember you&quot;, the anthemic &quot;18 &amp; life&quot;, the testosterone fueled &quot;youth gone wild&quot;, and the angry &quot;piece of me,&quot; which is a good preview of things to come for the band.  after those songs though, there isn't much to chew on.  you'll be disappointed because the quality seriously drops off in comparison to four classics.  lead singer sebastian bach's over-the-top singing is either great or annoying, depending on your taste, but over the course of a mediocre album it's usually the latter.  you're much better off looking into &quot;slave to the grind,&quot; and &quot;subhuman race.&quot;  of course, you'll probably want the better tracks from &quot;skid row,&quot; but they are readily available on the greatest hits album, &quot;40 seasons,&quot; which i strongly recommend if you're simply a passing fan.  the fact that a best of exists pretty much makes their debut irrelevant except for the dedicated fan or collector.  don't believe the hype.
B00000JJM2|4.0|No one can deny that Dirty Dancing contained great music that really made you want get up and have some fun.  This colledtion combines both soundtrack albums released (Dirty Dancing / More Dirty Dancing) with a few bonus tracks previously not available and a small booklet.<br />Of the bonus tracks, only the extended movie version of &quot;Time Of My Life&quot; is worth much intrest.  It's a bit odd that the radio version isn't included as well, but it is nice to hear the full length song for once.  The other bonus tracks are instrumental versions of &quot;Time Of My Life&quot; that are actually excerpts from the score instead of full length dubs.  One runs 41 seconds, the other 58 seconds.  My one real gripe with the set is that the total running time of both CD's is just about 75 minutes.  That's just enough to fit on one disc and should have been done to save the consumer some money.  Also it would've been nice to have the songs presented in the order they appeared in the film.<br />The discs are stored in the front and back flaps of a hard bound CD book with a 24 page booklet between them.  The booklet has many stills from the film (most retouched through a colored filter) and a few behind the scenes shots as well.  I would've liked to see a directors note or an overview of the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; phenomonon, but overall the packaging is done very well and only enhaces the feel of a special collectors item.<br />I've awarded four stars because there's just not enough offered for someone who already owns both soundtracks and is not a manic fan of the film like myself.  There are minor things that could have been done (ie; putting all tracks on one disc in the films order of appearance, including both versions of &quot;Time Of My Life&quot;) that would've made the &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; something really special.  However this is the perfect set for those that don't already own both Dirty Dancing soundtracks.  It's a great collection of music that makes great beach music and is sure to liven up parties or a bad day.  If you don't have it yet, you MUST get it now.kes great beach music and is sure to liven up parties or a bad day.  If you don't have it yet, you MUST get it now.
B0000025FG|2.0|If disco had been nipping at ELO's heels on 1977's &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, this is where it caught up and ripped them to shreds. The album is virtually unlistenable, save for three tracks: the hard-rocking &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot;, the humorously wistful &quot;Diary of Horace Wimp&quot;, and the upbeat and atypically straightforward &quot;On the Run&quot;. If only Jeff Lynne had used his powers for good... Of course, it was a huge hit.
B00004XQP4|3.0|Green Day's new album, Warning, plunges into deep new genres for the band.  When I bought the album, however, I was extremely disappointed.  The songs are creative, and a few of them catchy, but gone are those bopping distorted riffs and zany lyrics.  There is hardly a trace of anything that I have come to enjoy from Green Day.  To me they are saturday morning cartoon punk, often hilarious and impossible not to enjoy.  Now they are dark, accoustic and not smiling :-(.  They have unfortunately embarked on the final course of most punk rock bands... letting their music carry too much weight.

B00000DLUV|5.0|I have been a Bee Gee fan for as long as I have been alive (32 Years). My Father introduced them to me as a child and I have always LOVED them. This recording is like a great big hug from the Bee Gees as far as I'm concerned. I can put this cd on and leave it on all day and go through my day as happy as a clam. If you want the definitive music of the GREATEST entertainers and songwriters of all time then buy it.Run dont walk. Barry Gibb has the most tranquil voice I have ever heard. If the day sucks you can put this on and the day just melts away. My husband has been known to say &quot;Honey you need some Barry &quot;. He is always right. BUY IT you won't be sorry.
0226264017|1.0|Upon purchasing this book, I was expecting to read a logical argument in defense of free market capitalism, coupled with a defense of liberty and democracy.  Instead, I got what could only be called a poor intellectual argument, trying desparately to point out the glories of capitalism, but accomplishing nothing but failed logic and a depressing argumentative style.<br />After reading this book, I marvel at the fact that Milton Friedman actually recieved the Nobel Prize.  He uses almost no logic in his ethos, and actually points out many of the failures of capitalism in the process of glorifying it.  I would almost recommend this book to a liberal who is looking for concrete proof that conservatism is failed.  Here you have a man who is considered to be one of the smartest conservatives of the twentieth century, and he ends up doing nothing but Marxist bashing in this sad little diatribe.<br />I will give you an example: at one point in this book, Milton Friedman tries to attack the Communist ideal that wealth should be shared.  He gives the example of four men stranded on islands, three of whom land on islands with no resources, but one of whom ends up on an island with enough resources to nourish dozens of people.  He asks the reader, would it be justified if the other three men were to force the lucky man to share his resources?  Most readers would be tempted to say yes, as Milton points out.  He then moves on to another example to clarify the situation.  Suppose four men are walking along on the street, and one of them happens to find a fifty dollar bill on the ground.  Although the other three men might think it generous for the man to buy them drinks with this money, Milton claims that they surely would not be justified in forcing him to do so.  And he actually thinks that these two examples are synonymous!  He has changed the situation from a matter of life and death to a matter of a few refreshments!  This is outright sad for a Nobel Prize winner, and frankly I would expect more from a ten year old boy.<br />If you are looking for a review of conservative philosophy on government and economics, I would suggest for you to buy a book that is not as poorly written and sadly illogical as this one.  Purchasing this book is nothing more than a waste of money that could be spent on something more useful, and believe me, ANYTHING is more useful than purchasing this book.y I would expect more from a ten year old boy.<br />If you are looking for a review of conservative philosophy on government and economics, I would suggest for you to buy a book that is not as poorly written and sadly illogical as this one.

B00005A1PR|5.0|i consider myself to be one of the best critics of fine music that i know (if i do say so myself).  i have introduced many friends, family members and colleages to various types of music (that most of you won't hear on the radio or in your lifetime).  however, e'ry now and then (new yorker using my new found dc slang)you find a jem out there in radioland amongst those other records that mainstream radio makes us listen to time after time after time again. however, i don't think they knew what they had in india.arie!  this girl is hot and gifted and &quot;i see the GOD in her&quot;!  she touches the soul and can be compared to many that have tried before her, but this young lady &quot;...messed around and put out a classic&quot;.  trust me, if your review of this album was anything but, &quot;hot&quot;, &quot;slamming&quot;, &quot;dope&quot;, &quot;sick&quot;, &quot;off-the chain&quot; or just plain 'ol &quot;whoa&quot;...then you should perhaps go and dust off your r kelly albums and wonder where real music has gone.  then when you wake up, you'll realize that a classic just passed you by.  put it on random, listen to the songs that your friends have told you are great, then choose your own!  do whatever.  just enjoy it and save it for our next generation who may just think that ja-rule is as creative as it got in 2001!  oh yeah, make sure you learn every song and sing them...LOUDLY!  and if you want to take out an album, grab &quot;baduism&quot;, &quot;caron wheeler&quot; (living in the light), &quot;adriana evans&quot; and &quot;bridgette mcwilliams&quot; (1st one, also) to see the likeness and consistency of classic r&amp;b from real divas (i won't even start on that one).
B00005J6UP|5.0|&quot;The Goonies&quot; is the kind of film that comes around only once in a lifetime. It's a movie that a whole generation of kids experienced. It's by no means a &quot;serious&quot; movie but rather a fun, action-packed adventure which you will enjoy time after time. Basically the plot consists of a group of kids going on a treasure hunt but the plot is not as important as the adventures that take place.    Things that should be noted is the fact that the movie was scripted by steven Spielberg, but more importantly features Joe Pantoliano of Matrix fame (Cypher).    The DVD itself should be an absoulted gem containg such features as a video commentary consisting of a large number of the cast as well as the director. Other features include a &quot;making of&quot; and deleted scenes.     This should make a classic dvd which you will enjoy watching time after time, and if you have kids, it's time to introduce the goonies to a new generation.
B000001FE0|5.0|Odessa has to rank with Mr. Natural as one of the greatest unknown Bee Gees albums ever.  It definitely was their best of their 4 '60s CDs (although the other 3 are all solid).  What made this album even more incredible was that it came out at a time when all 3 brothers were having a tough time getting along with each other and by 1970, Robin had left the group.  If all you know about the Brothers Gibb is their stuff from the late '70s, then you really need to listen to this album because you will really be amazed at what you hear.  Originally envisioned as a concept album, Odessa is an hour of musical bliss.  Here's a track listing and my thoughts on each: 1) Odessa -- The title track is over 7 minutes long but it's an incredible 7 minutes.  Unbelievable harmonies that only the Brothers Gibb can do.  Starts the theme of love lost at sea. 2) You'll Never See my Face Again -- A light-hearted piece that's okay, but not one of my favorites. 3) Black Diamond -- A great song!  Robin gives one of his best performances ever in singing this gem. 4) Marley Purt Drive -- A song that definitely has a country feel to it with the banjo playing in the background.  Interesting song in many aspects including the memorable line &quot;with 16 kids and a family on the skids, I gotta go for a Sunday drive.&quot; 5) Edison -- A fun song to listen to.  I love the sound of the instruments in this song. 6) Melody Fair -- Classic Brothers Gibb.  An unbelievable song to say the least.  One of the main reasons to buy this album. 7) Suddenly -- An okay song but like #2, one that I don't really listen to alot. 8) Whisper Whisper -- A different type of song that was somewhat revolutionary in its time.  This isn't Stayin' Alive or Night Fever that you're listening to.  Curiously, it's one of my least listened to songs on the album. 9) Lamplight -- An important song for Bee Gees buffs (this was the song that caused Robin to leave the group).  IMHO, one of the best songs on the album.  Robin giveshis usual fine performance, but what makes this song great is the unbelievable harmonization by Maurice. 10) Sound of Love -- An okay song that has some good background music to it. 11) Give Your Best -- A somewhat hokey song that I usually skip when it comes on. 12) Seven Seas Symphony -- Purely instrumental.  It's actually an outstanding track as it showcases the Brothers' composition talents. 13) With All Nations -- Another instrumental track that is less than 2 minutes long.  Sounds alot like track #12. 14) I Laugh in Your Face -- One of my favorites on the album.  I love how they develop the mood to this song and then change it to something completely different. 15) Never Say Never Again -- Another solid song featuring a fine performance by Barry. 16) First of May -- Believe it or not, the only song on this album to hit the US Top 40 (peaked at #37).  Once again, Barry gives a fine performance.  This was the song that was picked over Lamplight and caused Robin to leave the group. 17) The British Opera -- The third instrumental track on the album.  It's a little more scary sounding than the other two. All in all a great and underappreciated album.  The best tracks are #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #9, #10, #12, #14, #15, and #16.  If you like good music, then the Bee Gees are always a smart choice to get; however, where most of their albums, like all other artists, have their filler tracks, Odessa is an example of what they can do when they really focus.  Once again, it's hard for me to imagine that they were able to do this considering the personal problems they were going through plus they were only 21, 19, and 19 when they did this!  Do yourself a favor and buy this album!
0783231032|5.0|I just rented this movie the other day and loved it. It has tons of big name actors in it. Belushi, Akroyd, J. Candy, etc. It is a great movie with tons of laughs. Belushi portrays Wild Bill Kelso perfectly and the DVD is great. The only problem I had with this movie is that it goes on a little longer than it should have. Other than that it is a great movie for everyone in your home.
B000001FNL|5.0|Before I review this great album, I feel that I need to get something off my chest.  I'm sick and tired of not only so-called &quot;music lovers and experts&quot; bashing the Bee Gees but all of American radio.  It is my sincere hope that everybody will give the Brothers Gibb's new CD This Is Where I Came In a fair chance.  People who think that the Bee Gees are nothing but disco need to listen to their first 4 albums especially Odessa or some of their later stuff like One and Size Isn't Everything.  Then they would realize how stupid and ignorant they really are when they &quot;discovered&quot; that the Bee Gees did other types of music besides disco.  Well, enough about that--on to Main Course.  This is without question their most consistent and endearing album that they ever did.  While Saturday Night Fever (which is technically not a Bee Gees album)and Spirits Having Flown had the bigger hits, Main Course has the better songs.  Here's a track listing and my thoughts on each: 1) Nights On Broadway -- One of my all-time favorite Bee Gees songs!  It is criminal that this song only reached #7!  I love the bridge! 2) Jive Talkin' -- The song that really started their comeback as it became their second #1 in the US.  Personally, it's okay, but there are other songs on this CD that I listen to more. 3) Wind of Change -- A pretty popular B-side that would later show up on their double CD, Greatest.  It has a good funky beat to it. 4) Songbird -- The first slow song or ballad on this album.  It features a harmonica and great harmonies. 5) Fanny (Be Tender With my Love) -- Another one of my all-time favorite songs by them!  Only reached #12 on the singles chart which I thought was a joke compared to what else was out there.  Very complex harmonies that featured many layers. 6) All This Making Love -- A bizarre song which is okay but is probably my least favorite on the album. 7) Country Lanes -- Another of one of my all-time favorite Bee Gees songs!  This has to rank right up there with And the Sun Will Shine and For Whom the Bell Tolls as one of their most underrated songs.  Robin's performance always sends chills down my spine. 8) Come On Over -- A solid song that would later become a minor hit for Olivia Newton-John and a country hit for Conway Twitty.  A great song for the musical ignoramuses who think the Bee Gees are nothing but disco to listen to. 9) Edge of the Universe -- A song that would become a minor hit but only when it was done live.  The lyrics to this song doesn't make any sense.  However, I like it over some of the other songs on this CD. 10) Baby As You Turn Away -- A great song to close out a great album.  All 3 brothers do a good job in harmonizing on this ballad. All in all, get this album because of Nights On Broadway, Wind of Change, Fanny, Country Lanes, Come On Over, Edge of the Universe, and of course, Jive Talkin.  If you decided to get only 1 of the 20+ Bee Gees CDs, this one would have to be your choice.  If you like great music like me, I guarantee that you won't be sorry if you buy this.
B00004YKUY|5.0|Once I saw the DirectTV preview of their Las Vegas concert, I thought, &quot;Journey is back; with their second wind.&quot;  I love Steve Perry, and I always will, but I know his failing health cannot allow him to continue the Journey legacy.  That is why I am so thankful God put another powerful voice on this earth like Steve Augeri.  I loved their concert, and I have loved their music for as long as I can remember.  I am glad to hear them back out there, going strong.  The songs on Arrival are traditional Journey, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Buy it as something to wail to in the car!  You won't be disappointed!

The way Pullman mixes it up with the 2 prequels will leave you amazed and gratefull that he ever took the time to write it.The only thing is, you must read the two books before it too fully understand it and get the full amazement, so read them FIRST!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD is a jam packed compilation of  #1 hits from the US and the UK spanning the 8 year period that the fab-four are so well known for. Starting with the light hearted Love Me Do, we travel through the many periods of their career including the movies they made, the Sergeant Pepper era and the introduction of Yoko's influence on the group. The CD wraps up appropriately with the song titled, The Long and Winding Road.<br />I found myself singing at the top of my lungs and enjoying the memories, as well as the upbeat feeling these songs are so capable of leaving me with. If you were ever a Beatles Fan or one of those people that only had a few favorites on each album this is the CD to have, and if you loved all of their music then this is some of the best of the best. You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Kelsana 4/20/01
0553213105|4.0|The book was recommened to me and I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I started reading it anyway.  The book drew me in adn I could not put it down.  The characters are all so charming.  Elizabeth Bennet is by far my favorite character.  She is very admirable, witty, smart, well informed and always polite.  She was always more concerned with her sister's love life then with her own.  This brings us to another character, Jane Bennet.  Jane is the prettiest in the Bennet family and her mother's favorite child.  Her relationship with Mr. Bingley, the new neighbor, is the talk of the town.  Their relationship is referred to a lot in the book, but the novel focused mostly on Elizabeth and her relationship with Mr. Darcy.  This is waht kept me interested in the book.  The story line is romatnic and kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. The question throughout the novel is if anything will happen between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic story lines.
B00003BDXG|5.0|When i first saw this movie i thought it sucked. but i watched it again a few years later and saw how amazing it was. Oliver Stone is a brilliant director. this film is one of the top 5 most well directed films of all time. lots of different camera tricks and stuff make this film great on a visual level. This is a satire on the media and it works brilliantly. it shows how the media cant be trusted and exploits people like Mickey and Mallory to make money by presenting them as heroes. lots of good scenes illustrate this. i love the scene where they are walking down the corridor to escape from the riot. also this film is actually kind off funny in a weird way sort of like \\" A Clockwork Orange\\" was kind of funny. dark humor but still funny. Great performances especially Tommy Lee Jones who really was impressive and funny in his role as the psycotic warden. dont judge this movie unless you actually watch it!
B00005AFVR|5.0|I admit it, this is my first Springsteen CD. After years of liking his stuff just enough to listen on radio(but never pay for a CD), I saw portions of the HBO special only because there was nothing on TV.  The intro to &quot;The River&quot; alone convinced me to purchase it, along with &quot;American Skin&quot;. I then discovered Springsteen emotion on &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, &quot;My Love...&quot; and even &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, which I had never cared for until this version came along.  Buy this CD now, it could change your life!
1573225517|5.0|I made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book.  Don't get me wrong -- I really liked the movie.  In fact, I own the movie, but, I wish I would have read the book first, just so I could have had a better insight on the characters.<br />&quot;High Fidelity&quot; by British writer Nick Hornby is probably the most humorous piece of fiction I have ever read.  I have never read any of Hornby's other works, but after reading this, I can't wait to get started on the next.<br />Hornby's main character, Rob, narrates the entire book, letting the reader in on the &quot;ins and outs&quot; of the male mind.  Very original. The book starts with Rob's girlfriend, Laura, moving her things out of their flat after they had broken up.  Rob tries to convince himself that he will be fine, that the breakup won't affect him in any way, and that Laura will be back.  From there, the story stems to Rob's trying to cope with losing Laura, and his many stages of getting over her.<br />The best part of this book, in my opinion, would be Rob's co-workers, Dick and Barry.  They add just the right comedic touches to Rob's life that he needs, but doesn't realize it, or appreciate it, for that matter.  The constant bickering between the three men in Rob's record store, Championship Vinyl, was enough to make me laugh out loud....honestly.<br />If I would have known better, I would have read this over the summer when I had more time to fully appreciate Hornby's writing, rather than reading it while having other things going on during this past semester at college.  But, I fully recommend this book not only for it's humor, but because it has an excellent plot and is very well-written.
6305907439|5.0|As others mentioned before, this video is great.What impresses me the most is the excellent performance of Steve Morse.Watching him play his guitar is absolutely fabulous.I was lucky enough to see the live show of this concerto twice,once in Belgium and the other time in Holland.The video differs slightly from those life performances.It's a pitty that the tape does not include &quot;Night meets light&quot; and the beautiful intro to &quot;Smoke on the water&quot;.What I regret the most however, is the fact that the camera is not always focused on Steve Morse while he is soloing.For instance there are a few moments of amazing guitarwork during &quot;Pictures of home&quot;  where the camera is showing members of the orchestra.During such important soloparts the camera should better stay close to the performing artist.Nevertheless when there's nothing interesting on TV, wich is mostly the case in our coutry, I put my tape of DP on and enjoy it over and over again.
B00003CWTI|4.0|well, this mammoth of film took me two previous rental attempts before i could actually finish it.  eventually, i really got into this film.  but the problem was, it seems that all the stories could not be all actually working in perfection all at once.  you see, in the opening, most of the performances were either &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;pretty good&quot; minus julianne moore's, of whom was just kinda...[boring]...at the begining.<br />eventually, tom cruise got his screen time and i can safely say he will never be in a better film.  however, once the interview he had reached it's climax... it kinda fell out.  eventually, julianne moore's previously lagging performance sped up and she was gooooddd.  then, of course, the cop (too lazy to check the name, sorry) became tiresome (the &quot;finding gun&quot; sequence was really awfully photographed), and i was totally immersed by the game show.  however, at this point phillip seymour hoffman, of whom i am a big fan of, had a performance consisting of running around a lot.  then of course, william h. macy kinda fell apart, but it all reached a point where everything was good.<br />so, to sum it up: it was good, but then it started lagging, then it was good again, etc.

B00003CXGP|4.0|this has to be one of the better recent films i have seen.  the film had attracted a lot of controversy, so i figured what the heck, i'll go.  and rightfully so.  the film is very, very violent (but one wonders how a blatant yuppie like patrick would obtain a chainsaw...) but the violence is just so funny.  i, honestly, have never seen a funnier portrayal of yuppies than in this film.  the film lacks the book's hilarious use of brand names, but other than that this is solid.<br />so, why, might you ask, did i not give it 5 stars?<br />well, first, i'm all senile and stuff, and second, yeah, it can get a bit ridiculously over the top sometimes.  but you should still see it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a very good movie.  The animation is superb, and the story is very compelling.  All the characters are well crafted and very original.  The DVD version is very good because of it features.  I think every kid should be able to watch and enjoy this movie.  It is an awesome movie.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie struck an emotional chord with me that no other movie has before.  Russell Crowe's magnetic performance anchors the spectacular action.  <br />But this is not just an action flick.  As a matter of fact, I hate action movies.  I seriously despised Braveheart.  I rented this movie expecting to hate it.  By the time the ending credits rolled, I was shaking in my chair from the sheer emotional impact and the catharsis of it all.  <br />Gladiator is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.  It's simply wonderful.  By the time I'd watched it three or four times, I started to notice how well-crafted everything is:  the cinematography, the art direction, and most especially the musical score.  But the first two times, it was a pure emotional experience.  My #1 all-time favorite.
6300214826|1.0|How people rank this movie so high I will never know. It was extremely difficult for me to watch this film, because I was so disturbed by the graphic deaths/murders of innocent Vietnamese. No doubt that scenes such as that were very realistic, and probably US soldiers did that and worse, knowing how much disregard they have for human lives in real life (i.e. The Gulf War, WW2, Korean and Vietnam Wars). I am extremely disapproving of war in general, and there is a lot of pain left over from these unnecessary battles that are lasting, for the innocent victims. If there should be a movie at all about how horrifying war is, it should not be graphic, intensely disturbing displays of mass murder; but a thorough examination at the psychological aspect of those involved with the war: the soldiers figbting against each other, the families of those who leave for war, the emotional scars of those who have lost a loved one. This is truly an awful movie, to say the least.
0399146253|5.0|Great Book, Great Book, Great Book! A pen pal of mine turned me on to Patrica Cornwell a few year back. She sent me her copy of All that remains. I enjoyed it some. Then later I read I Black Notice. I enjoyed that one too and found myself wanted to read more and more of the author. Why? So much had happened between those too books and I did enjoy the characters.   I didn't think I would get another book by this author until I read that The Last Precinct  starts right after Black Notice. I was interested in how the author would manage the after effect in a novel.  She did it Masterfully. Quite so. This is a very propelling book to read. With the right amount of symbolism we were able to see that the outside world cutting into the Dr's like just as how work might.<br />Uniquely, sub plots, as usually are ever present but not so much that it distract from the Doctors life.  We have scandal, lies and betrayal all together with a strong character with no way to turn.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|Did you read my earlier review below? Well, I just forgot to mention that &quot;S&amp;T&quot; features digitally remastered versions of all the songs, which in itself adds a new depth to the band's sound and their production techniques. Sure, the trio's early albums were released in the infancy of the CD technology, which makes the slightly muddy audio of &quot;Head over heels&quot; and &quot;Tiny dynamine/Echoes..&quot; forgivable, but the low dynamic range of their mid-to-late-'80s material detracted a bit from the quality of the music. Listening to many Cocteau Twins albums and EPs over the years shows clearly that the trio thrive on economical pop arrangements which nevertheless employ a lot of sonic details and manage to transcend any musical boundaries -- apart from the need to find an appropriate musical accompaniment for Liz's vocals, which is one of the hardest tasks one can imagine. Now you can fully appreciate the band's striking artistic and technical achievements with the dynamic and utterly flawless audio quality of this 18-track compilation: The early cuts such as &quot;Sugar hiccup&quot; and &quot;Lorelei&quot; do greatly benefit from the remastering treatments; the drum machines hit a bit harder and echo around in various directions, while Simon's bass playing is much more discernible in the mix, bringing a new clarity to his style. In short, all the instruments frame the voice of Liz much better than before, perhaps best heard on &quot;Aikea-Guinea&quot; whose clanging frame drums have never sounded better. Robin's opening guitar chords on &quot;Pink orange red&quot;, &quot;Heaven..&quot;, and &quot;Carolyn's fingers&quot; also achieve a stronger emotional power than before. It's a pleasure to listen to the opening section of &quot;Lazy calm&quot; with tape hiss subtracted, and &quot;The thinner the air&quot; finally lives up to its title as everything sounds like it's floating randomly in the air. It also should be noted that you can hear some elements which were buried in the arrangements before: There's a lot of acoustic guitar playing on the latter-day songs, and some of the cymbals/hi-hats/claps are brought out much clearer now. Although not among my favorite CT songs, &quot;Fifty-fifty clown&quot; and &quot;Watchlar&quot; have improved because the insistent bass pulses propel both songs more effectively than before and add a stronger edge to these otherwise not so exciting songs. Of course, the way Liz's vocals are integrated into the music (or, depending on your view, the other way round) also deserves a glowing critical bouquet: During the last verse of &quot;Pandora&quot; her voice sounds like echoing up from the depth of a cavern, while at other times she floats ethereally over chiming guitar chords (&quot;Carolyn's fingers&quot;, &quot;Heaven or..&quot;) or sounds a little more 'normal' and intelligible in context (&quot;Blind..&quot;, &quot;My love..&quot;, &quot;Iceblink luck&quot;). Another bonus is the 8-page, full-color booklet, which contains liner notes by Alan Warner and makes for as professional a finished product as one could hope for. One might question the value of an item which is almost entirely composed from previously available singles and album tracks, but that would be missing the point. Firstly, this is the best place to start for new fans (&quot;BBC Sessions&quot;, &quot;The pink opaque&quot;, and &quot;The forgotten 4AD track&quot; are more expensive and not as representative of the band's work), secondly, the songs are virtually all highlights, and thirdly, the digital remastering shows the virtues of the band in the best light. In sum, this is a thrillingly enjoyable album from one of the most influential and distinctive bands of the '80s.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|I had seen TotW in the theatre (Anthology Film Archives, NYC), on video and I could feel the power, in spite of the jumpy images, splotches of darkness, scratchy prints. The DVD transfer is magisterial. Clean, sharp, the underlying visual rhythm clearly discernible, the structure of the work exerting its magic without restraint. And, as good a sound as one can ever expect. The transition between pompous nocturnal nazi party celebrations to a misty dawn progressively clearing to reveal air views of Nuremberg's ancient rooftops, with the lens coming to rest fully sharp on row upon row of simmetrical white tents, where party members are waking up, all set to the quiet prelude to the third act of Wagner's Meistersinger (a piece in itself celebratory of German art and set in medieval Nuremberg), is pure cinema magic. And it establishes visual continuity (ergo historical?) from the traditional Germany of Hans Sachs to its 20th century flowering under Adolf Hitler...... not a small feat to accomplish within less than a handful of cinematic minutes.<br />Like magic, there is technique behind it. This is not a news-style documentary but a film constructed flawlessly in the editing room. Leni had full control of the editing and supposedly did most of it herself. The result is mesmerizing. One can understand how an unthinking populace could fall for it, and how keen an intellect and great an artist Riefenstahl is (I gather she's still active at 90+).  This is not just a nicely crafted collection of pretty pictures of an old city and massive nazi spectacle. Everything is calculated to evoke an emotional response helping consolidate the identification of Germany as Hitler and Hitler as Germany. Yet, it is also a beautiful film.  It is frightening for its lack of human ambiguity, for the willful surrender of a people to a master. There is a lot of &quot;joy&quot; portrayed in the film (perhaps of the &quot;strength through joy&quot; kind) but after seeing it this time, I realized there is not a single funny moment in it.<br />Placing myself in 1935 Germany, and erasing from my mind everything that subsequently happened, I was comfortably glad to realize that, temperamentally, I would have had a hard time with the nazis, indeed would probably have reacted to all things around me by becoming an anarchist or some such thing. But ... who knows? Films like this are made to seduce.<br />The DVD comes with a short documentary of German military maneuvres also from 1935.  It still amazes me that the French and the English, seeing these two films, not to mention taking into account other German actions in the Ruhr, etc., did not commence rearmament sooner or would not have been so duped at Munich.<br />If you feel it is immoral to watch this movie .... get over it. Anyone with a serious interest in film needs to see this. Anyone interested in seeing how visual imagery can be structured to propagate a faith needs to see this. For that matter, all our contemporary putative manipulators: marketeers, political consultants, advertising executives, TV and  movie producers ought to see this. Citizens who want to remain informed and self-determinating ought to see this. Most immediately, anyone who wants to put together a beautiful, masterly structured film from tons of negative reels needs to see this.... and I don't think anyone born after the war has seen it better than in this DVD.d there is not a single funny moment in it. <br />Placing myself in 1935 Germany, and erasing from my mind everything that subsequently happened, I was comfortably glad to realize that, temperamentally, I would have had a hard time with the nazis, indeed would probably have reacted to all things around me by becoming an anarchist or some such thing.

B000059R8Y|4.0|This is musical humanity. I've always liked Eric Clapton but he always had this larger than life quality. Here he shows his human side, I think that comes out because the loss of his uncle. He can still rock and his solos on &quot;I Ain't Gonna Stand for it&quot; are right up there with his best. He does what he does best and that is make good songs. I listened to the original Stevie Wonder rendition and Clapton's isn't better or worse, just definitely Clapton style. The same is true for his cover of Dylan's Born in Time on the album Pilgrim. His covers are never knock offs, they always have his distinctive signature. He also covered a James Taylor song but I don't know the original. He's getting more and more acoustic which is alright. Travelin' Light is a good down and dirty song written by songwriter J.J. Cale who also wrote After Midnight and you can tell. The original songs are also good, these include Believe in Life and Reptile. Good album all around, a good mix of styles and sounds.
B00003CXQY|5.0|After a few Disney disappointments and Dreamworks successes, it was beginning to look like Disney had lost their edge, however this magical film has recaptured Disney's magic in allits glory.  The villian is reminiscent of Cruella DeVille, but with magic backing her up.  <br />This cartoon/movie has a unique hero in that he's not a stereotypical Disney good-guy.<br />The humor is fast paced and clever.  Another Disney success.
B00004Z400|5.0|Ah the Deftones...personally my favorite band. Their third effort White Pony was the most anticipated rock album of last year. For a reason. It starts off with the pounding sound of &quot;Back to School&quot;....an anthem for every teenager out there. This is probably Chino's second most screamy song. his first is &quot;Elite&quot;....not really my taste but constantly gets stuck in my head......To, me the best song is &quot;knife prty&quot;...its highly envigorating and refreshing....the lyrics are so intricate....chinos singing is purely mesmerizing......it always suprised me how chino can go from a soft whisper to a high pitched scream in about 1 second....this whole band has talent<br />if youre looking for a cd that youll keep in your stereo for months....this is the one....<br />white pony is an evolution for the deftones
B000002U6E|5.0|So, what can i say...it's great!!! Seriously, it's the best. Micheal Cretu makes you feel the same emotions that he feels when he listens to his own music. He can make a single song become an own album. I bought this cd just few days ago(reading Amazon's reviews) and i found it so incredible!!! You just don't want to stop listening over and over songs you've already listened thousands of time!!! Lyrics tell some historical(like &quot;Silent warrior&quot;)and personal(like &quot;The dream of the dolphin&quot;)sories. They are very simples but they had made me think how long&quot;...white men came in the name of God...but for the ones who abuse his name there'll be no chance to escape on Judgement day...&quot;. I already have their last album(The screen behind the mirrow), and The cross of changes is a bit different from it. The first is made with modern sounds, the second is more primitive but also more original!!! If you like this kind of music, Enigma will explain you how many meanings an album can hide. The only adjective I could say are...inspired, dedicated, historical and marvellous!!! Follow my advice, you'd better buy this cd.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Kevin Smith takes a shot at religion especially Catholicism in this riotous comedy that was the best movie of 1999. This movie makes a lot of philosophical and poignant points. The thing to remember is that this is a satire and you should be offended by it although as with plenty of movies out these days people invaribly did.  If can look by that you can truly enjoy this great movie.  Two angels(Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) have found a way to get back into heaven. The only problem is it will lead to the destruction of the world.  The only chance to prevent this catastrophe falls in the hands of a decendent of Jesus Christ(Linda Fiorentino)two goofy profits Jay and Silent Bob(Smith and the great Jason Mewes),the 13th apostle played by hilarious stand-up Chris Rock and Alan Rickman who provides sarcastic and witty lines as the voice of God.  Jason Lee once again pops up as Azrael. Alanis Morissette makes a cameo appearance as does George Carlin(he plays a cardinal) Salma Hayek does a decent job as a sexy muse.
0553106635|5.0|The only other fantasy I remember reading and enjoying was the Lord of the Rings. As great as Tolkien was, I really think Martin has taken a seat at the head of the table. I read all three books in this series in a couple of months, then went back and read the whole thing over again. I never do that! Absolutely delicious characters and plotting, cleanly written. It's going to be a happy day when I can lay my hands on the next one, right now would be soon enough for me.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Kevin Smith is the best filmaker ever. His first feature was this hilarious and innovative look at the lives of two best friends who are employees at a convenience store and rental store. Smith did this movie on practicly no budget, in black and white, and cast his friends into roles in the movie.  I find it ironic that this is the best movie ever beating out all the big-buget Hollywood movies with A-list actors and actresses.  Smith's humor is a mix between gross-out and subtle and intelligent jokes.  There are plenty of classic scenes in this movie i.e Randal(Jeff Anderson) ordering porno movies in front of a young child and a mother and Dante's (Brian O'Halloran) girlfriends startling revelation. Smith does an excellent job of creating dialogue between the two manin characters and the many customers they encounter on an average day. His witty satire makes many great comments on the nature of suburbia and society as a whole.  I would without a doubt recommend this movie to you.
0785721681|1.0|Seems thrown together by Grisham to capitalize on the popularity of his earlier books, to which I would asign an average of 4.5 stars. I will continue to try his books but with lowered expectations.
B000058T5E|5.0|If you like monsterous guitar tone, great beats, and amazing guitar talent, you won't take this out of your CD player. Nadia and Suspension are destined to become classics, and the solo in Dirty Mind is awesome. Left Hook and Loose Cannon show Jeff is by no means 56 years old....Clapton can't even get close to this! Buy this CD, and buy a few more for your friends. Jeff Beck is back and in fine, fine fashion!
B000002G87|4.0|I can definitely agree that this is a high quality recording by Eric Clapton and the rest of the Dominoes.  Eric contributes some of his best songs here such as Bell Bottom Blues, Layla, I Looked Away, and Why Does Love Have To Be So Sad.  The guitar duels between Eric and Duane Allman are indeed legendary and the vocals by Eric and Bobbie Whitlock in support are quite strong as well.<br />What keeps this recording from receiving a five start rating to my ears is the plodding bitter blues tone that exists from track to track.  Variety is somewhat lacking on this collection.  I Am Yours and to some extent Thorn Tree In The Garden are the only variations that exist here.<br />As I stated before, this is a strong collection by Eric Clapton no doubt about it.  However, I prefer Disraeli Gears from Eric's Cream days and Another Ticket, UnPlugged, Behind The Cradle, his debut solo record, and possibly a few other discs because Eric varies his approach just a little bit more.
B000058T5E|5.0|This is Jeff Beck at his best. He is, simply put, the greatest guitarist on earth. But don't take my word for it, buy You Had It Coming and push play....you'll see the light!
B000000WGL|3.0|I do applaud Keith Richards for recording this solo album.  After numerous years of showing what he could do as a Rolling Stone, I find it interesting hearing Keith keep his rock n roll roots while the late seventies and early to mid eighties Rolling Stones recordings were delving into the excesses of disco and punk.  I Could Have Stood You Up is a nice bouncy rockabilly tune that features some neat solos from former Stone Mick Taylor.  Make No Mistake features a nice duet between Keith and Sarah Dash with a nice mellow jazz/funk background.  You Don't Move Me and Take It So Hard feature some classic Keith riffs even if the hooks are a little weak.<br />Probably what keeps this record from getting a higher grade is the overall lack of hooks.  Many of the songs on the second half of the record just beat to deatht he same chord progression.  Heck Rock A While sounds like a broken record all together.  I guess that is why Mick Jagger was so essential to the Stones.  He could write in a good change of pace chord sequence.<br />Anyway, this might be an interesting addition to most Stones fans collections.  However, it rates more as interesting rather than spectacular.
0345350499|3.0|I have read both Mists of Avalon and Forest House.  Both have excellent character portrayal.  You really feel you are living in the time with all the conflicts between ancient and &quot;modern&quot; British civilization.  The viewpoint from the women's perspective is very good.  I particularly liked the portrayal of the mysticism surrounding the ancietn Celt Goddess.  However, the book was tedious and very slow moving.  I had to work up a mindset to read it.  It was not one I longed to get back to and couldn't wait to start up after laying it down.
B000003CMB|3.0|No doubt about it.  The Allman Brothers will live on as one of the Classic Jam Bands that ever recorded music.  Duane Allman and Dickey Betts could solo like only a handful of others.  Jamoe, Greg, Butch, and Berry are talents as well.<br />This recording is loaded with Blues based jams delivered in a rock n roll setting.  Where the tunes are pretty cool, after a while the length of the songs can grate on many listeners nerves.  This collection would be more appropriate in video as one can see and feel the experience of an Allman Brothers Concert.  Die hard fans should grab this collection right away but those who like a little more polish and focus with song length not exceding ten minutes can pass this one by.
B00000BKDW|4.0|powerslave is a great album and of course should purhcased by anyone who favours heavy metal a la maiden. however it seems that the album is missing something, a key element to the songs isnt there. in this review i will attempt to tell you what and where i believe important elements are missing. 1) aces high- great pounding opening track great rythm, lead and rythm guitars and of course bruce is singing well 2) 2 minutes to midnite-same as aces high a classic 3) lofser words- creative if not repetitive instrumental worth listening to  4) flash of the blade- fantastic opening, verse and chorus riffs youll be singing along to this one. However, there is no guitar solo, just a nice little melodic bit. my complaint with this is the rythm guitar and drum during this bit(Nicko sounds like hes banging on pots and pans and whoever is doing ryhtm guitar decided to make it really dull) 5) the duellists- this song doesnt sound at all like iron maiden teh main verse, while being nice and melodic, just doesnt have a maiden feel to it. the solo in this song is overly long and makes you want to put your head in your hands. The lead bit is ok( nothing special)  but it would have been much enhanced had there been a good, tight rythm section( which it doesnt) 6) back in the village- worth skipping 7) powerslave- magnificent song, its better live though because it doesnt have that stupid background chanting during the chorus 8) rime of the ancient mariner- great song, the part in the middle gets a bit boring, but the part after that rocks boys and girls, there arent many moments in rock history that are more powerful than right after bruce sings &quot;down comes the rain!&quot;<br />so laddies to sum it up this album is definetely worth buying. However, in my opinion,it doesnt have the  bone chilling, headbanging maiden feel that makes them so great.For the most part the rythm section is almost catatonic(except in songs like 2 mins, aces, powerslave, and mariner) some of the songs lack the energy and speed of other songs from other albums(number of the beast, piece of mind, iron maiden, killers, somewhere in time, 7th son of a 7th son, no prayer for the dying, brave new world)<br />Up the Irons!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is truly the epic film. As a movie lover, I have never seen such poetic heroisim in any kind of story. David Lean has his masterpiece. Every aspect of the film is nearly perfect. Although at times seems slow for younger viewers, at 20 years of age I was inspired to research more of this young Lawrence of Arabia. From what I read about Sir Lawrence, he was truely intellegent, brave, and at times seems mad beyond common sence. He captured the imagination of a generation of a people at war. His Seven Pillars of Wisdom gives us his wisdom, courage, and his wrath. He also tells us he has had his doubts. That he has a conscious. Human and then some. But then David Lean (Peter O'tool) shows us more. The madness of this misfit anglo-saxon-arabian knight who was in the right place at the right time that becomes the general of the first modern Arabian Army. And he is not sure that he wants to be the legend. He who wants to be human (average). Far from being so, in any case, not only is the character interesting but the location, directing,  cinematography, soundtrack, acting and the insight will insure that there there won't be a remake of this MASTERPIECE for a long, long time. Now at the age of thirty, this is in my top five films. The DVD features are excellent. Although my keep-case is falling apart.
0156907399|5.0|I loved this book.   I would not have liked it as much when I was younger, under 40, that is.   I would recommend all read The Hours by Michael Cunningham and look for the movie that is being made of it.  It won the Pulitzer Prize.   It is mostly &quot;about&quot; Virginia Woolf.  HJK
0425152251|1.0|The plot is awful, the &quot;twist&quot; absolutely cliched, and, most importantly, the &quot;history of philosophy&quot; is abismal. Do NOT think you know ANYTHING about philosophy after reading this book.  If you want to know about philosophy --  and not just be able to drop names --  GO READ PHILOSOPHY!  You can do it.  Its not dry, its not boring, and it can be done.  If you don't want to actually learn about philosophy, don't pretend you do. And if you want to read a good novel, pick one that has a real plot, real characters, and real ideas.  I suggest Italo Calvino -- he actually knows how to do magical realism.  (And he probably understands Kant better too.)<br />DO NOT give this book to anyone.  Do not reccomend it. Do not read it.  Its cliched, banal, and morally reprehensible.
0380788624|1.0|Although the story had a potential there is not a cluster of more than three pages which can keep the readers interest for more than a few minutes.Overall the book is way too long and too fragmented between one too many settings to be a good read.
B00000163G|5.0|If you have followed The Source magazine through the years, you are sure to have had your fair share of beefs with their ratings system.  They have been stingy with their esteemed 5-mic rating (and rightfully so).  While they never officially weighed in on this album, it is definately every bit as worthy of classic status as any of the albums that have been given the praise (from Life After Death and Aquemini to Paid In Full).  The reason I say this is that this album has something for everyone.  While the backpackers can listen to &quot;Got My Mind Made Up&quot; with a show-stealing performance by the ever amazing Redman on their headphones, their little sister can be down the hall listening to &quot;How Do You Want It&quot; on the radio, while their mom could be heard humming the tune of &quot;Life Goes On&quot; in the kitchen.  <br />This album captures 2Pac at the peak of his short lived career.  What set him apart from all of the other comparable MCs was that he put his whole heart in every line spit.  That is why his pop songs were so good that you almost didn't feel guilty for liking them, while his harder songs sounded so real that it is almost eerie when you listen to them juxtaposed against the context of his early demise.  While the standout tracks are many (the only flop on the album is the strangley off point DJ Quik produced &quot;When We Ride&quot;)the real gems are: the barn blazin' opener &quot;Ambitionz Az a Ridah&quot;, the Devante Swing (yes, the same Devante Swing who made Jodeci the best R&amp;B group of the past 20 years)produced &quot;No More Pain&quot;, the (Knot Just)Knee Deep/Whats My Name tinged &quot;Can't C Me&quot;, and &quot;Picture Me Rollin'&quot;.  In fact the only area where this album falters is when less than average MC get their chance to rap along side legends (the Outlawz, Syke...).  This can be overlooked though because a majority of the guest appearances fit right in with the overall epic feel of the record.  <br />While everything 2Pac put out is worth a listen, if for some reason you can only have one Pac album, pick this one.  His first few albums were him trying to develop his talent to match his ambition while his post-death work (aside from the outstanding Makaveli album which was fully completed before his death)is very hit-and-miss due to questionable production.  This album is truly a classic in every since of the word.
B00003CXB2|1.0|I am used to seeing movies with fast action or at least a good story. This movie has neither. Some british guy goes to the mideast and fights with turks. The screenplay never explains why he would do that. At least the writer who wrote this uninteresting piece of fiction could have created a plausible story. The movie is so slow moving and dull that I fell asleep.
0385493622|5.0|Okay, he might deviate a little from the subjuct at times, but Simon has still turned out a masterpiece, of which you don't need to know alot of math to understand.<br />Simon has done an amazing thing when he wrote this book. He made a book about math sound interesting. IMAGINE THAT!<br />Well, go on...read it...buy it...it is worth your money
0792156684|2.0|This story of a big ship getting sunk is plainly unbelievable. They should have thought about the plot better before setting out to film the movie. Why write the story in such a way that the ship sinks and everyone dies? It would have been a better love story if the ship had just plainly reached its destination and had a happy ending. Just my 2 cents.
0385495315|5.0|Simon Singh has put out another masterpiece. The Code Book.<br />This is a must read for everyone, from a casual reader, to one who digs mystery novels. Singh puts the entire science of codes into one book. He covers the ancient start of codes and travels into the future, where quatum computers will make and break codes.<br />Simon has a way of writing that makes you want to read on, even if it covers a subject that might seem a little dull. To read this, a background in math or cryptology isn't needed. All you need to know is english. And since you are reading this review, you must know it, so you can read this book!<br />So go onward...click buy...and enjoy!
B00003CXPD|5.0|As a dancer myself, I am in love with Billy Elliot. It has a certain magic that touches the heart of every aspiring human out there.  This movie inspires me that I can do it.  It relates to me as a person.  Jamie Bell is fantastic, and since we took dancing classes together, his life and character in the movie is fascinatingly similar.  We all come from the same town and share the same dream, but he is the one that made it so real that viewers and friends like us feel it.  I bought the soundtrack right away and have seen the movie 5 times including once with Jamie himself.  It was cool to get insight from him.  Believe me, this is a must see.  Way to go, Jamie!! :)  This movie will make is easire for you to come closer to your dream.  The dancing scenes and the last scenes are my favorite.  I will watch it again and again.  Love it.
0140177396|5.0|I had to read this book for my American Literature class and I just thought that it was going to be another boring book.  I was surprised to find out how wrong I was.  Lenny is this guy who is not smart but is strong.  George is the &quot;brain&quot; in this duo.  These two are the people who are least likely to become friends.  They are the typical Freudian friends.  I don't want to give any of the good parts away, but this is one of the greatest books I have ever read.
B000002GOZ|5.0|We all have come to love and cherish the simply awesome musical talent of Bryan Adams through these past two decades. In this awesome 1996 release, Bryan Adams takes some of his old hits and some of his unreleased talent to make one great show/cd. One of the greatest songs on the cd has to be &quot;When You Love Someone&quot;, sort of a Titanic theme meets Celine Dion ballad. Another highlight of this cd has to be the opening track, Summer of '69. He takes the somewhat rocky hit, tones it down a tad, and produces an awesome live track. If you own any Bryan Adams cds, make sure to pick this one up, you'll love it!!
0156711427|5.0|This is an excellent book, but it is not the easiest of reads.  If you do not understand Hindi, then you may have learn a few words, but there aren't too many.  I do not think that the novel has a straight-forward moral that says, &quot;The English are bad.  Good bye.&quot;  Instead, the novel shows the ambiguity of human life and the fact that there is no column in which you can put all of the good guys and another in which you put all of the bad guys.  The characters in this novel are complex and show different weaknesses.  The book offers excellent insight into the world of colonial India and the many different social strata that existed.<br />This book is best read in long sections - don't read a few pages or one chapter at a time.  I hope you enjoy it.
B00004XOWM|2.0|What happened, when I 1st listened to 3doll.bill, I thought that the band was very raw it sounded like a demo(it really was) but there was talent there. Then with your second album, the band really grew the songs were different and it was a well rounded album, I still listen to this album to this day. The new album seems like it was just thrown together most of the rap songs do not even sound mixed properly or how about letting the guest rappers play with the band(who still sound good) after all this was a limp bizkit album. there are about 4 or 5 good songs which in todays world is a lot, but on a whole save your money and buy an old cd that you might have lost that you liked. In my opinion this album was a money making scheme that is why they are so quick to put out a new album in july!. they probally only had material to make 1 good album but instead they decided to run a scam on the fans by breaking it into two. well they lost the respect of this fan and the sale of asecond album fooled me once they will not get me a second time----so only buy this album if your 15 and under or a girl because you can get your parents to pay for it
6304981635|5.0|This is such a great DVD, i was very pleased with it. Firstly, it has good picture and sound quality, as well as widescreen mode. The DVD has extras like an interview with Bruce, an introduction by his wife, and a behind-the-scenes feature. In the interview Bruce discusses alot of his personal philosophies and his life, which is a real treat. The other extras are quite nice too. For such a low price you really get a well-made, good quality DVD.<br />Oh by the way, this is one of Bruce Lee's finest movies. If you haven't seen it go do it now, whether you're a kung-fu fan or not. The Legend lives on!
B00005A1PR|5.0|I am very pleased to say that I am very satisfied with this purchase.  India.Arie is a very talented sister.  I love this whole CD.  My favorite songs are &quot;Always In My Head&quot;, &quot;Brown Skin&quot;, &quot;Simple&quot;, &quot;Part Of My Life&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;.
B00000JGEF|5.0|This is one of the most unique science fiction movies I have seen in all my years of reviewing movies. I loved it so much that here I am, in 2001, reviewing this flick which was made in, I believe, 1987. The casting was perfect: a tight knit band of soldiers sent on one mission, but who end up running for their lives when some space predator decides to pick them off, one by one. Its convincing -- the jungle serves as the perfect setting for a number of scene switches, from water and mud to forests. But what really makes the movie work is the fact that the movie is on almost 30 minutes before you even see the monster! That's how good it is. I like the use of Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Arnold as leaders of a multi-racial team of soldiers; I also liked Carl Weathers playing what he really is -- a &quot;tom.&quot; But other than that, &quot;Predator&quot; is a combination of &quot;man vs. man,&quot; &quot;man vs. his environment&quot; and &quot;man vs. himself.&quot; Arnold is innovative as he fights the intergalactic &quot;scavenger&quot; who takes human spines as his trophies. This movie is to &quot;neo-science fiction&quot; what &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is to conventional sci-fi fare. If you haven't seen this movie, you'll be riveted to your seat. And the haunting melody of the soundtrack is as exciting as the action on the screen.
6305750750|3.0|This movie is surrounded in controversy.  Some hate it and some like it whilst others seem to like it but have problems here and there.  I fall in the latter category.  I like this film but I had a few problems with it.<br />Before I continue with the review of the film I will just mention a bit about the transfer.  The widescreen image that we get on the video is THX certified and is one of the most impressive widescreen tapes I have.  Colours just jump from the screen.  The sound is also reasonably good.  Just turn it up really loud and you will know what I mean.<br />Firstly the positives.  The lightsaber battles, the pod race, and the droid fights were extremely impressive.  The large space battle towards the end was very impressive.  Well done Industrial Light and Magic you guys have produced quite impressive pieces of eye candy.  The story was relatively simple and easy to follow as well.  Jar Jar did not annoy me, he provided some well timed comic relief for the kids as well as few instances for the adults.  Lastly Ian McDiarmid has the best performance in this film in my opinion.<br />The problems however were concerned mainly around the actors.  Jake Llyod was awkward with his deliveries.  I expected so much from Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor, that their performances seemed dry.  Apart from the acting and a relatively slow middle (on Tatooine) it was an impressive Star Wars film.<br />By the way the only thing preventing this from getting 4 stars is the fact that this would look so much better on DVD in anamorphic widescreen and full 5.1 surround.  VHS just isn't that impressive in its presentation anymore.
B0000584V3|5.0|I am writing this review in response to the person from London who gave this album 2 stars!  This album is a classic, and deserves an arguement in its defense.  The reviewer complains about its lack of musicianship and its too prevelant non-metal qualities.  Fine, its not very technical for death metal, but does that really matter?  His power metal bands are very technical, but do they combine innovative musical styles with good song writing like Opeth? No!!  I will also agree with his assertion that Blackwater Park is a record that doesn't stay within metal exclusively.  However, I find it a refreshing change of pace within a relatively stagnant genre. With each Opeth CD you can be certain to recieve a kind of music that only they perform, and excellent clean vocals and beautiful acoustic guitars make a perfect addition to death metal!  I will admit that I don't like this album as much as Morningrise but Blackwater Park is not a sell-out album and Opeth won't be poppy anytime soon like In Flames and Cradle of Filth are becoming.  Listen to songs like Bleak, Harvest, The Drapery Falls or the Funeral Portrait and then decide whether chessy Power Metal and sell-outs COF and In Flames could write material this good.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator, Academy Award Winner for 2000 Best Picture.  The story of a General's fall and rise to Arena champion in his pursuit of vengeance is powered by Russel Crowe's great performance and Ridley Scott's impressive direction.  This 2 Disc set does the film justice.  Another impressive effort from Dreamworks.<br />The video transfer presented in anamorphic widescreen is extremely impressive.  With vibrant colours to the bleak greys and blues of Rome this transfer never ceases to impress.  The opening battle is also complemented by the earthy tones present in the transfer giving the film a gritty and realistic look.<br />The sound on the DVD is extremely impressive.  The Dolby Digital track is very impressive.  The clarity is there and it makes an impressive use of the surrounds.  However the DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete soundtrack is amazing.  I consider it reference quality.  The sound is absolutely amazing.  If you have a DTS capable amplifier don't even bother with the Dolby Digital Track.<br />The extras are not as plentiful as some other DVDs on the market yet they are of very good quality.  The 3 documentaries are very interesting.  There is an extensive deleted scenes section.  As well as plenty of storyboards and trailers and TV Spots.  The Spencer Treat Clark journal is actually quite interesting so give it a read.  Lastly the commentary with Ridley Scott and the Cinematographer and Pietro Scalia is very interesting and entertaining.<br />A film that could be considered an epic has received a very worthy treatment on DVD.
B0000399WI|5.0|You've read all the other reviews - this movie has everything: brilliant plot, top notch acting, great directing.<br />I predict in say, 40 years time this movie will be regarded as, just that - The Greatest film of all time. Ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, more and more people have been taken in by this underrated masterpiece. It's only a matter of time.
B000050FEN|3.0|Seven is a great movie.  If you're reading this, you probably like the movie, so there's no point talking about it.<br />The added bonuses, however, fail to live up to expectations.  The commentaries are inane at best.  When talking about scenes that were cut down or cut out, the director's comments are &quot;We decided to cut this scene.  I like the lighting, though.&quot;  Nothing about why they cut the scene, or why they decided to change it, or anything that might have been interesting.  When talking about the opening credits, he says something like &quot;We hand wrote the names.  Neat.&quot;  Not where the inspiration for the pictures came from, just that they made credits.  The &quot;additional endings&quot; they promise are a test ending that is basically the same as the final ending, and a storyboard ending that wasn't filmed.  Not what I hoped for.  The pictures from John Doe film is really dumb, since most of the pictures are badly exposured and have been deteriorated to the point where there's no picture, just blobs.  Dumb use of disc space and a waste of time to watch.<br />I was expecting something more in the commentaries, like why they did what they did, not just that they did it.  The movie gets 4 stars, the other stuff gets 2 for an average of 3 stars.
B00004ZD69|2.0|This c.d. from the Canadian collective with the unusual name and the album title that's even more unusual,I purchased last year.This was based on one or two reviews in music magazines that said this c.d. was indispensible!I also read all the reviews on this website and decided to give it a go!<br /> Well it was a bit of a shock when I bought it cos it's a double c.d. that has only 4 tracks-or suites as the group themselves like to call them.The music is part of the post-rock genre that seems to be gaining in popularity,what with groups like Mogwai and Sigur Ros doing quite well.There is no vocals on this c.d. really to speak of.There are a few monologues-my favourite being the old man talking about Coney Island when he was young-but this gets old pretty fast.The music always builds up to crescendo's very,very gradually.I mean nothing on this album happens quickly and there is very little immediacy on the 2 c.d.'s.I suppose the group are building up the mood.It's all pretty ambient,full of distorted loud guitars,spacy guitars and some more gentle sounding mellow guitars.Added to this there are vast string and full-bodied orchestral sections that all sort of comes together during the climax of each suite.I don't know,I mean I've made a great effort with this c.d.,but despite listening to it on numerous occasions I just find it too much a strain to really enjoy it.It could best be described as a very interesting but very difficult listen.I suppose that is what the group is striving for and if this is the case then they have certainly succeeded.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever heard. I've been listening to it almost every single day since I got it (which is almost a year and a half ago). It is that good. I had just recently lent my CD to a friend and he told me it's making him a fan now. If you like upbeat songs, you'll probably like &quot;Affirmation,&quot; &quot;The Best Thing,&quot; or &quot;Chained to You.&quot; If you like slow songs, you'll definitely love the rest of the album. My most favourite songs include &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; (which is a simple love song), &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; and &quot;Two Beds and a Coffee Machine&quot; (this is a sad song about spousal abuse). Not only are the lyrics good but also the music. Darren and Daniel are definitely genuises. They are the best. If you liked the first album, you'll definitely like this one (unless you think slow songs are boring). It's WAY better than the first. They songs are more poetic and more mature than their first album. If you haven't already got the CD, I suggest you try it out.
1569382603|5.0|To really appreciate all of Mr. Hancock's materials, I recommend viewing the tape Monuments to Life, which is a lecture he gave at Leeds in 1996.  In this tape he presents a wide range of his views, and shows his great insights to the ancient clues that surround us here on earth.<br />One of Mr. Hancock's greatest assets is his contempt for the &quot;stories&quot; we have been told as facts through the years, and his replacement of far more plausible explanations.<br />I would have to rate Mr. Handcock as a guide in the wilderness, and his insights provide a path to a far more acceptable presentation of the ancient world than any other single speaker.<br />While I would assume they don't welcome him in Egypt, I welcome him with open arms, and mind, because he looks and reports what he finds, not what he feels will be accepted.<br />NOTE: The next time you see pyramids with steps, don't think of them as being used to go up, think of them as being used to go down, and see if the picture makes more sense...
B000002UJQ|5.0|It is a little out of the mainstream, but you will love it on your 2nd listen, guaranteed. It matches the Bends!
B000002LCB|5.0|You'll really enjoy this album.     Why? because the music in it just makes you smile. It has it's more quiet tunes and more thrilling tracks, thus making it fit for every occasion--like talking, studying, working, sleeping... or reading The Princess Bride book, even.     Just like the movie, this album has everything--from love songs, or themes about friendship, swordfights, enemies, giants, the cliffs of insanity...     If you liked the movie, you must own this album. If you don't know the movie, listen to the samples above and find a whole new world of magic.
B000002UR7|3.0|I suppose that I would have given a more positive review of this CD if I had listened to it before I listened to Radiohead's masterpieces like the Bends, OK Computer, KID A, and the yet-to-be-released Amnesiac, but I din't. This is a nice grunge album, at its very best equaling Nirvana in music quality, but it is not as experimental yet still pleasing to the ear as OK or &quot;Bends&quot;, or as whacked out but still devilishly cool as Kid A or Amnesiac. Still, a good introduction to one of the world's greatest bands.
B0000027G6|5.0|John Barry's score for Dances With Wolves has been a classic and for good reason.  The John Dunbar theme has been heard countless times and is famous like the theme from Jaws.  It is simplistic like the other themes but this makes it even better.  It has a homely feeling like Home On The Range but without the lyrics.  Two Socks', the wolf, theme is bittersweet and sad-sounding.  Hearing the part where he gets shot is guranteed to make you cry.  The Love theme is lovely and homely-sounding like the John Dunbar theme but sounds more like a village theme.  Track 3 has a great secondary theme played by the strings and french horn.  It's sad that it's only used once because it really fits in with the western frontier theme of the movie.  The high, tense strings in the Pawnee theme sends chills up my spine every time, like on track 5.  Track 8 is my favorite track and theme but it has a hard time competing with track 10 that has John Dunbar's theme played lively by the brass section.  Every track on the cd is great and this is a rare occurence for any score.  I recommend this as a MUST for ANY SCORE FAN.  It is highly original and has a very western sound to it.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I felt this was a great adaptation of Cameron Crowe's adventures as a journalist for Rolling Stone, powered by strong performances, especially with Jason Lee and Kate Hudson. The soundtrack, though not exactly my type, does a great job setting the mood for this classic story.  This is one of the most original, touching, at times flat-out hilarious rock and roll stories ever created!
B000000OEI|4.0|How would I know that a score about some people in a submarine would be so great?  Crimson Tide is an excellent blend of electronics, orchestra, and chorus.  It beats The Hunt For The Red October in suspense music but it has a little bit of trouble competing with its excellent theme.  The theme played mainly by french horn and chorus in the minor key is very masculine and fits the spirit of the submarine, bursting out with power in the major key when taken up by the trombone section.  The villian theme heard on track 2 near the end is very hostile-sounding but doesn't carry out long enough to be considered a theme.  The use of &quot;Eternal Father Strong To Save&quot; by Zimmer is a nice touch to the score.  As I said, Crimson Tide sounds great with suspense music but it gets tiring after a while, especially considering that the cd consists of only 5 tracks of massive size.  I mostly have to skip around until I get out of the low suspense parts.  Near the end of massive track 2, a chilling male chorus plays as a confrontation occurs between the main characters, one of the best parts I've heard from a chorus.  At track 4, the music starts to get frantic and confrontational but a still has some boring suspense music.  I recommend this to anyone who likes the score to Hunt For The Red October or masculine brassy scores, but just make sure your cd player has a fast-forward button because you'll be using it quite often.  It has small great parts between tension music.
B000003TAW|5.0|Despite the fact that 95% of these reviews are positive, there are a few nay-sayers, accusing Weezer of being unoriginal, uninspired and tiring. Well, who really cares? They are a fun group to listen to! The thing is, only Weezer can do Weezer-esque rock. Many &quot;Weezer-esque&quot; bands (ie: Ozma, Matt Sharp's The Rentals, and a plethora of indie bands) have attempted to re-create the sound of Weezer with their own songs, and often come up short.  The only group (well, it's one person) who has managed to come close to re-creating &quot;Weezer-esque&quot; rock is drummer Pat Wilson's The Special Goodness. The aforementioned Rentals come close, but steer off in a completely different direction, which appears to be intentional. Which proves that only Weezer can re-create Weezer, no matter who it is from Weezer doing it. Confused? The only people who can do Weezer-esque rock have to either belong, or have belonged to, Weezer (Although it is worth noting that the Sugar Ray &quot;tribute&quot; song to Weezer, &quot;Rivers,&quot; eerily re-creates River's vocal aura, and I HATE Sugar Ray.) Anyways, this is a great album, Pinkerton is a very underrated album, which at times tops this one in it's lyrical complexity and overbearing guitars, despite the raw production turning off mainstream fans. The thing about Weezer that really attracts me to their style of music is how universal the mood of the music can be.  I can listen to Weezer, no matter what mood I am in, and I can't truly say that about any other band.  Whether it be the strange irony in the lyrics, the aggressive, heavily-distorted sound of the guitars, or the smooth-yet-strained vocals of Rivers Cuomo, this is my favorite band, I have owned (well, co-owned, with my older sister, but she eventually let me keep it) this CD since 6th grade, in 1994, when &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; was a huge radio hit, and still listen to it regularly, although my new favorite track is &quot;Say It Ain't So.&quot;
B00003CXN4|5.0|Many parents won't let their children see this because of the gritty drug content.  Those parents are missing the point.  No self-respecting child would get involved in drugs after viewing this film.  Traffic has a realistic quality usualy only found in documentaries.  The cast is so good that you forget that they're even acting.  This movie deserved every oscar it garnered and then some (namely Best Picture.)
B00005B1EX|5.0|I expected a lot from this album and got even more than I bargained for; this is truly incredible. With the exception of &quot;Slow Down&quot; (and only because I'm just not a fan of the song), every track is a winner. While I think &quot;Resurrection&quot; sounds a bit better on the album, it still comes off very well here. It's also great to hear some old Priest tunes re-energized with much heavier guitars behind them. Finally, &quot;Screaming in the Dark&quot; bodes very well for the next studio effort.  Of course, Halford's voice has to be commented on. Does anyone else sound so good at his age? The guy's in his 50's! I honestly don't know how it's possible for him to be hitting those notes after so many years and so many shows... It is clear now that Halford is THE heavy metal vocalist of all time - no one else even comes close (Ian Gillian and Ronnie Dio being more hard rock singers, in my opinion, and they don't sound nearly so great as they once did). Buy this album.
B0000025T6|5.0|Atlantic City is one of my favorite Springsteen songs, but I'd only heard it as a single separate from the album.  I'd been told by various friends that this album was very dark and the songs were stripped of the drums/horns/electric guitars that were the driving force of some of his other songs.  I didn't think that this album would really be appealing, but found that it's impossible to dislike.  It's amazing, and the fact that it doesn't have songs like Born to Run or Human Touch make for a much more intimate and personal listening experience.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen brothers serve up a beautifully filmed and nearly perfectly executed movie with many scenes and songs that linger in ones head.  It shows both the dark and light of the South in the depression, and reminds us of the power of the music that tried to help everyone get through the rough times.  The warmer sounds of songs like &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; and &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; are yearnings for that better place far away.  The premier song, &quot;Man of constant sorrow&quot;, is a great blues\bluegrass piece, with both performances by Clooney and Cohorts being enjoyably funny.  But perhaps the most impressive song and visual in this film is the baptism scene, when our heroes are suddenly surrounded by white clad Christians floating through the beautiful Southern woods like fireflies all singing a building gospel hymn &quot;Down to the river&quot; - a very mesmerizing moment.<br />The performances are great.  Clooney has an energetic wild eyed zeal and pulls of some great rapid dialog as Ulysses.  Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro do well as the slow witted traveling companions.  Daniel von Bargen (probably known best currently for his role as the Commandant at the military school on &quot;Malcom in the Middle&quot;) fits the old image of the sherrif perfectly with his cool mannerisms, black outfit, sunglasses (the only person wearing them) and black hat.<br />While generally funny, the film also has reminders of the effects of the depression on already poor farmers.  It also doesn't forget racial issues in the form of the KKK and how many of its members could make themselves out to be &quot;normal decent folk&quot; during the day when they weren't hiding in bedsheets carrying silly names.  Some people take offense at the KKK scene in the movie, but I thought it pointed out the silliness of these people dressing in these costumes and thinking they were superior while also showing that enough stupidity gathered together can do some pretty terriblethings.  It can be an uncomfortable scene, but it does contribute to the story (and shows, through our heroes, that not *every* white person in the south was a bigot).<br />Ultimately, this movie was an enjoyable experience for me.  I could even call it uplifting, as it's beautiful photography and soundtrack have caused me to start liking the South again and appeciate more of the Gospel and Bluegrass from the time.  I love listening to &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; from the soundtrack and picturing soaring up over the dusty roads and fields through gold tinted lenses.
B000021Y77|5.0|I did not expect a 50-year old like me would find this move awesome, but I did.  The techo-beat during most of the film kept my body moving in rythym with the beat.  The subtle songs in the background by the star (Franka Potente) fit perfectly in the scenes in which they were inserted.  The best part after watching the DVD three times was the commentary by the director and by Franka Potente.  Their insight into the challenges of filming on a tight budget and trying to get permission to film in varous parts of Berlin was entertaining.  Best part number 2 was the music video by Franka.
6304698682|3.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Pale Rider\\" (1985) is an entertaining yet derivative Western that represents the flip side of the actor-director's \\"High Plains Drifter\\" - a far-superior effort. Though Eastwood delivers a fine performance as the mysterious Preacher, with good support from Michael Moriarty and Carrie Snodgress, the overall film lacks the dramatic resonance of \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" and \\"Unforgiven.\\" Instead, \\"Pale Rider\\" tries to evoke the classic tradition of George Stevens' \\"Shane\\" and partially succeeds. The film has some good action sequences, but drags a bit in the midsection. Still, a flawed Eastwood Western is better than none.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This must have been great Cable-TV when it was on HBO, to which we don't subscribe. It's even better in the DVD version. High quality resolution AND surround sound via DVD make this a must-see for intelligent, sophisticated viewers who don't find much to satisfy on standard network TV. <br />In fact, if even movies were this good, we'd be going all the time! The writing is superb, as is the acting, sets and fast-paced story line. If you've ever lived, as a single, in a large urban city and were remotely involved in the 'dating game', then you'll be able to relate to the characters. While mostly women, there are enough male characters for both sexes to connect with the 'dating game' and its ups and downs-- and the characters' ambitions, loves, fears and shared joys.  Now I know why there has been so much &quot;buzz&quot; about this series... It's a totally sexy, hip romp! (Note: this is defintely not something that  &quot;Christian Coalition&quot; types will admit to liking....!)
B00005A1PR|5.0|I am into many different genres of music, but I have noticed lately alot of less-than-stellar female vocalists (ex. nelly furtado).  I think India.arie has a great voice and she has the ability to turn a basic three chord guitar line that has been used in 50 other songs into something original and special.  This is a very good album.
B000002BE9|5.0|Wow! Wow! <br />Fiona Apple's music is the most elegant music. It compares to Loreena McKennitt and Sarah McLachlan. Here lies true talent and beauty! Fiona's voice is so gorgeous that when you see a photo of her, your jaw drops. Such a small person with such a huge, deep, powerful voice. <br />&quot;Never is a Promise&quot; and &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; are my favorites. Very moody, but gorgeously intelligent and deep in raw emotion. But the whole CD can play and you will never want to change the track. <br />Tidal is a classic. It should be one of those albums that stays in your collection forever and never leaves.
B0000025DR|4.0|Fire on high is quite simply hands down the greatest recorded rock instrumental period.
B00004YKUY|3.0|Ignore all the hype that this new singer sounds like Steve Perry. It's not true. That's not to say he's bad, just that he is not Steve Perry. Also, lost in all the commotion over the singers is the fact that replacing one of the top 5 drummers in rock history has also altered their sound significantly. Again this isn't necesarrily a bad thing, in fact, I'd say the writing is quite good on this. If this had been released as a Bad English album, I'd say it was by far their best to date--I'd even go so far as to say Steve Ag is like hearing John Waite amped up to 10. Johnathan Cain and Neal Schon have some killer hooks--some of their best-- but with the Journey name hanging over it, I keep going back to the notion that if it were Steve Perry singing and Steve Smith drumming on these songs, this  could possibly have been the best Journey CD of all time.
B00004NHCC|5.0|I'm not one to overly examine music, I'm not sure if I fully understand what a riff or an octave is. Luckily one doesn't need to know these definitions in order to appreciate the majesty and power of this recording. 'April in Paris' is a beautiful peace of music. I couldn't say what the song is about, it goes beyond semantics to feelings of lost happy memories. 'September Song' condenses the cycle of renewal and decay of 52 weeks into just under 6 minutes of music. Epic yet intimate. The uptempo numbers are strong too but it is the slow ballads that really demonstrate an artist at the height of her powers interacting freely with an excellent small ensemble. The song 'Embraceable You' could easily be addressed to this great collection of tracks. I only regret that at 31 I didn't come across it sooner.
0446677450|3.0|I tore through this book in a few hours.  It's well written, yet not rich in content.  I thank Mr. Kiyosaki for sharing and Ms. Lechter for her editorial/writing skills.  I found many of the concepts that Mr. Kiyosaki delivers in the book brought back old thoughts that I had when I first enetered the work force almost 20 years ago.  After years of success and set backs I wish I had kept my focus on the thoughts that I had then and Mr. Kiyosaki reinforces in this book.  If you are looking for a reson to kick start yourself towards independence from the rat race this is a very good reminder of why you need to do it and may give you the push you need to go for it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a great cd, and has all of the Beatles songs we know and love. It's got everything. From &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; to &quot;Come Together&quot;. This cd explores both the &quot;Bubblegum Beatles&quot; and the &quot;Hippie Beatles&quot;. This cd is definately for everyone. The Beatles re-envented Rock N' Roll. This cd is certainly worth the money. You won't be disapointed.
0553347845|4.0|I read this book for a high school physics class.  I really ended up reading it because it was ine of the few books that my dad had in his personal library.  (I didn't feel like going OUT and getting a book)  It actually turned out to be an interesting book.  It had lots of funny parts, along with some informative sections about science &quot;things&quot;.  I found it to be a good book, not as good as something that I would read for leasuire, but it's a book that I'm glad I read.
6301955595|5.0|&quot;Santa Sangre&quot; is a shockingly original film. It is brilliantly written, performed and directed. It is amazing how much director Alejandro Jodorowsky packs into this visceral masterpiece. There are so many story threads and connections and characters and each never lapses. The visual style of the movie is also haunting, with images that are unforgettable. There are moments when Jodorowsky's film takes on the impression of a dream (or nightmare). There is surrealism, drama, violence and romance mingled so brilliantly that there are reminders of the great Spanish surrealist Luis Buuel. The actors are incredibly good and the film has a passion that flows in the imagination of it's construction. There are moments of spectacle that are unrestrained and truly impact, like a scene where an elephant's coffin is tipped over onto a garbage dump and is ripped open by starving scavengers. And there is the haunting sequence in a graveyard where the spirits of past victims rise out to haunt the main character. In a time of such tame work, &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; shows true filmmaking passion and the daring art of a great director. You know a director is great when out of such violence and chaos he can still sustain a sweet love story. &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; is a masterpiece.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I think that this is one of the best pj cds of all time, its so freakin diverse. its got punk, its got pop, its got all sorts of great music, it has the bands guitarist singing on &quot;Mankind&quot; and the albums 3 straight ahead rockers, 'Hail, Hail,' 'Lukin,' and 'Habit,' are really great punk songs, with 'Lukin' only going on for about 1 minute, in the true punk fashion. &quot;In My Tree,&quot; a song about getting high, is really a great song as is &quot;Who You Are&quot;  You know how PJ are huge Who fanatics? well dont you think that its funny that the who have &quot;Who Are You&quot; and pj have &quot;Who You Are&quot;  i think thats funny, i mean, the songs dont sound anything alike but still, interesting coincidence. Off He Goes, Around The Bend, Sometimes, I'm Open, and Smile are great pretty songs. I wish that i could make pretty songs like that. I think that theres a song that im missing but i cant remember<br />well, anyway, i think that for the few albums that this has sold (its barely went platinum) its an extremely diverse album and, like Vitalogy, hints at a band growing up and fully  matured on the next album. But that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.
B0000024ZC|4.0|Gentle Giant's third album (but their first US release which, interestingly enough, uses the cover art from their very first album)was more unified and structured (in terms of the themes) when compared to their first two albums. This concept album (which conceptually was the brainchild of Phil Shulman)works well at exploring the divergent paths that can both change and bring childhood friends together.<br /><br />The inconsistent songwriting mars what could have been one of GG's finest albums. Still, Three Friends manages to convey all of the mixed emotions of its theme in a thoughtful and musically interesting fashion. Although not as compelling or stunning as Octopus, (the follow up album and the last to feature Phil Shulman as a member)it is also less indulgent than that album. Three Friends clearly established the ground work that would allow the band to create a trio of great albums including Octopus, In a Glass House and Free Hand.<br /><br />The sound quality on the Columbia CD is murky when compared to some of the imports. I'm sure this has to do with the analog copy that Columbia used for the CD issue. Still, it's not compressed like the poorly done Japanese reissue in mini-sleeve from 2006 and it has better dynamics than the version that was mastered by Eroc for 2008. The 2011 remaster done by Ray Shulman and Fred Kervorkian used the original mastertapes for the first time EVER for CD but that version isn't as dynamic and has some peak limiting applied to it which, if they hadn't done that, might have made it the best edition of the album on CD ever. Unfortunately, each CD release of the album is flawed in one way or another.<br /><br />If you're working backwards from the band's more accomplished albums, you'll probably be either baffled or disappointed. I'd recommend giving Three Friends a chance as it continues to improve with time.
B000002VCU|5.0|The real way to look at this LP is was this a Movie Soundtrack that never Developed? Have been listening to Alan Parsons since I Robot and this reminds me of the previous albums ...ie: Always painting a picture for our Ears...Thank You For Reading my Review...Gregory
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is my first Sarah McLachlan CD and I *loved* it. Everyone else says it's way more impersonal than her other CDs and live performances... I was shocked, because I thought it was just amazing how much emotion she puts into each word. So I can't wait to get her other CDs. But I think this one is great- and contrary to what everyone says, it makes a great first CD for a new McLachlan fan! The best songs on the disc are Building a Mystery, Adia, and Fear.
B00000ICD9|5.0|A story about soul mates going beyond life to find eachother. Captivating and inspiring, Robin Williams' best film yet.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Well. While I saw it last year, films such as Caesar and Cleopatra, Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Quo Vadis? and Cleopatra rolled in my head. But this was different. A real characterisation of a person who longed for a family reunion in Valhalla. And even better; the action/spectacular scenes never interfered with the story but served its purpose... It is a magical piece of work and a good swansong for Oliver Reed.
B000002BYD|5.0|I think that this might be the only PJ album (and one of the only ever) that rivals the greatest cd of all time, In Utero. thats an opinion of mine that in utero is the greatest cd, but thats not the point right now, lets talk about yield, i think that this cd has great almost country-ish style songs like Lowlight, and Wishlist and also great punk song Brain of JFK, and (my fav. pj song) Do The Evolution, unlike with Vitalogy I like the experimental after DTE, the first time i heard it i thought it was funny but then i tryed to listen to what they were saying and its actually &quot;We're all crazy at war&quot; i thought they were just repeating themselves but thats not important, on to the last 2 songs Push Me, Pull Me &amp; All those Yesterdays, i think that Push Me Pull Me has some of PJ's most interesting lyrics ever,  and All Those Yesterdays is a good song, the only bad part is when i try to sing it it sounds like ragtime but dont let me start on my singing, ok?  The instrumental after the last song is great and it sounds spanish flavored<br />all in all this cd is really great and i love pj for it. underated and better than Ten.<br />But thats just my opinion. I could be wrong.
B000000993|4.0|Undertow the second of the 3 (soon to be 4) Tool albums. This is probably the less heavy of them. Fans of the less heavy A Perfect Circle will probably like this one the best. Every thing about this CD is good except for the disgusting pictures in the liner notes. Favorite songs are Prison Sex, Sober, Intollerace, Undertow, Bottom. Buy it!
B00003CXE7|5.0|WOW, this was a great one. The scenery was absoluty amazing. The Roman Collesium brought back to life! The fight scenes for all you action junkies were the best I've seen in a while! The plot was well made. Not enough can be said about this movie. One of the greatest of all time. It's your duty as a movie watcher to go out and see this one or pick it up on DVD! The DVD has great special interviews and a lot more good stuff. Hooray for Gladiator!
630542845X|5.0|I think that this movie is absolutely amazing--I've wanted to see it for years, and finally got around to it.  I think that other movies like THE GREEN MILE definitely borrowed elements from this film, and that POWDER is really well-done and forces you to think.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is going 2 be short. Simply because &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; is a modern masterpiece. WHYYYYYYYYYYY? Well, because the cast and crew has given us a flowergreeting, a heavenly symphony orchestra that plays the most magical music ever... ????????? That was a metaphore.  BILLY ELLIOT is a stunning piece of filmmaking and should NEVER be missed.
B000003TAR|5.0|I definitely think that In Utero is a great album. the first time i heard 'Milk It,' I got scared, and that was cool. Besides that, Rape Me, Tourette's, Serve The Servants, RFUS, and Scentless Aprentice continue on the band's unique pop/punk grunge stuff, but a handful of newer styled songs keep Nirvana from falling into the &quot;Seattle&quot; sub genre of music, Nirvana are not just grunge and Pennyroyal Tea, All Apologies, and Heart Shaped Box prove that to be true.<br />But that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.
B000002AZ8|5.0|I'm a huge Smashing Pumpkins fanatic, so I am connected to the whole grunge scene in some sort of altered way. Pearl Jam has never been a good band to me. Until recently, anyway. I know I'm going to get shot for saying this, but I didn't really fall for Ten. It just sounded so easy to make. The only thing I really liked about that album was Oceans and the lyrics to most of the songs...(but I like Even Flow and Deep, the rest just seem boring). Well, after that, my parents happened to slip me the Yield CD. Boy, that CD woke me up. I love every single second of that CD, and I still do. After that, I gave Ten another try. And it was better than before, but just not what I was looking for. I didn't know much about Pearl Jam, so I decided to get Binaural. That CD has to be the best CD of the past 20 years, yet so many are overlooking its genius. After that, I got Vitalogy. Bingo. Now this is music. No song, no matter what anybody says, is weird. Why? Because it shows that Pearl Jam is a versatile, always-changing-yet-still-connected-to-their-roots kind of band. Pry, to is an awesome song; I wish it could have gone on for more time, but keeping it short is the smart way to go. I put that song on Repeat 1 and listen to it over and over, although it doesn't make sense, it sort of does. I had seen Pearl Jam do Not For You on SNL a few minutes before leaving to get my drivers' license, and I had that song in my head for forever. The simple riff and beat made it an awesome song. The subject matter seemed perfect at the time because of all the Ticketmaster fiasco and the trouble of being less commercial with themselves. Nothingman and Betterman, while both extremely similar in name, are not the same sound. And they are great. I love Stupid Mop. I think it's weird, but so cool. The wacky speech in the background makes it interesting to listen to. Bugs is awesome, too. It sounds so cool when you have it cranked up in your room. Spin the Black Circle was fast and furious, which isthe way I like 'em. Last Exit was cool, too. It seems the first song on the most of the CDs by Pearl Jam are short and melodic but fast (Brain of J., Last Exit, Go, and Breakerfall). I think my favorites on this CD are Corduroy and Tremor Christ. I love the sound of Tremor Christ. The lyrics are astounding and Eddie's voices just knocks me over. Definitely a classic. Same with Corduroy (maybe a song about Ticketmaster?). If you have some money on you, forget whatever your going to use it for, and buy this CD. If you have the CD and don't listen to it, put it in your CD player right now and listen. And when I say listen, I mean LISTEN. You can hear the power and emotion in the songs, even if they are weird. Just listen, and it might change your point-of-view on Pearl Jam.
0393307050|5.0|I like historical fiction and this is my first venture into fiction involving the sea.  It's the first book in a 20-odd book series about a commander of a British vessel during the Napoleonic Wars and his associate, the ship's doctor.  This first book describes how Jack Aubrey becomes commander of a British vessel and the first battles he encounters. The book is interesting because there is so much detail about the Royal Navy.  The food they eat is described as well as the frequent punishments handed out to sailors for offenses such as drinking on the job.  It's a fictional book you can learn some naval history from too. I liked it and plan to read the others in the series.
6304535570|4.0|My mother was uncertain about me buying this video at first, but when I insisted on getting it after reading the reviews here I was satisfied that my money had been well spent. The Saint is unlike any movie I've ever seen before. Like in my title: yes, it is abstract and dim, the dialogue gets a little backward and hard to understand, and Simon Templar seems to have very few motives that made him an international spy. His disguises give the movie it's comedy, of which there is not much because the lovely Elisabeth Shue is the co-star which of course catches your eye. The romance is rather weird but charming, and some things in the movie seem to happen for no reason at all. But it's still good spy action as Simon and Emma, Shue's character who has created the formula for cold fusion, are pursued around Russia by a politically powerful and corrupt group of authorities whom Simon tried to trick.   Their adventures there, in Russia- which the movie displays as cold, crowded, and rather malevolent- are definitely worth your time. Val Kilmer is quite handsome and suave as the Saint, and although he's not english, this unique film will serve you well.
B000001IQH|5.0|I love Rancid, and this CD.  Rancid are a different kind of punk.  They have an edgy, ruling sound which nobody else could create besides Rancid.  This CD is truly amazing.  Everybody who wants a good CD to listen to non-stop, should buy Rancid's, &quot;...And Out Comes The Wolves&quot;
B00000163G|5.0|i love 2 pac music but i just mostly his song on disc one and these song are life go on and how you want it and also ain't mad at cha and also whatz yall phone number and on disc two i just like a couple song on this disc and thereare wanna why they call u ratha be ya and all eyesz on me and than run the streetz and this is the best cd that 2 pac ever put out beside me against the world these two cd is the bomb im telling yall that yall need to pick up these two cd and belive me yall will not be wasting yall money because i have been a big 2 pac fan since 1993 when his has release his third album strickly for my nizza and that cd it alright but not like me against the world and all eyesz on me .
B000002U9W|4.0|Of course, nothing Pink Floyd ever did after Syd Barrett left ever matched The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but the rest of the band were very good musicians in their own right. It's unfair to constantly compare the band's later efforts to their first album, as they did evolve into a very different unit. Atom Heart Mother has the advantage over more celebrated albums such as Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here because it is much fresher and less world-weary than the aforementioned albums. The band retain a sense of humour in this album, therefore making the grandiosity of the work easier to accept than their subsequent moody and over-serious extended compositions. Pomposity - a detrimental claim continually levelled at the band by critcs - is certainly present, but I do not feel that this in any way hinders the music - quite the opposite, in fact. In any case, the willingness to try something different and even slightly experimental is too often mistaken for pretension. The title song works much better than it sounds like it should when you consider that it was PF's stab at a near-classical composition, and for this much credit must go to Ron Geesin as well as the band. I only decided to give this album another listen recently after neglecting for a long while (the price of paying too much attention to self-righteous critics), and it has now become one of my favourite Floyd albums, if only for that damn attractive cover art.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This movie was better at home on DVD than in the theater.  I didn't think much of it until I got it for christmas and sat back at home and let it rip.
B000002UAX|5.0|The only word I can think of to describe this album: Incredible. Music doesn't get much better than The Beatles' White Album. You have something for everyone. You've got ballads like &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;Julia,&quot; you have classic rock n' roll in &quot;Back in the USSR.&quot; You have 60's pop in &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; and &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; and hard rock in &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;Yer Blues&quot; (plus, a kickin' guitar solo in the latter song). You have folk- &quot;Cry Baby Cry,&quot; and even some swing music here with &quot;Honey Pie.&quot; This album is THE BEST, and The Beatles really demonstrate just how immensely talented they are both as a group and as individual members. This is a MUST HAVE album.
B0000025F7|5.0|Growing up in the seventies, I thought Michael Jackson was already the most important star(he was to me) and I only sang along to his parts on all the Jackson 5 albums.  Then 1978 came, and when &quot;don't stop..&quot; was released I was amazed. <br />Wow.<br />&quot;looking in my mirror, &quot;.. Has there ever been anything more beautifully sang than this song??? <br />As for those that demean and depreciate Thriller....<br />Stop playing. I mean, really....Stop playing.   Thriller was and is as great as we thought it was the first time we heard it BEFORE ANY OF THE VIDEOS!!!!<br />Stop hating the man, Love this music.<br />The music of our lives.
B00003CWOL|5.0|I can honestly say that Kevin Smith is one of my top few favorite directors. I love all of his films. Clerks was a very smart comedy. Mallrats was a dumb comedy(that's why that's my favorite one.). Chasing Amy was a very charming comedy. Next on that list comes Dogma.<br />Dogma is a story of two fallen angels, a faithless woman, the voice of God, two prophets, a 13th apostle, a muse, an angry demon and Alanis Morrisette(Once you'll see it, you'll know what I mean). All these characters blend together in a hilarious comedy that makes you think about Catholicism in a different way.<br />On to Brandon's DVD scale. (1 the lowest, 5 the highest)<br />Movie: 5. It's not Mallrats, but it's close.<br />Picture and Sound: 5. No complaints here.<br />Special Features: 3. Languages and Subtitles and a trailer. Nothing that great. I guess I'll have to wait for the Special Edition.<br />All in all. 9/10. Highly recommended.<br />P.S: Jay and Silent Bob rule!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|i must say, there are few harcore/punk bands these days, which i really like. relationship of command is in fact one of my favourite releases of 2000. this is very unique and the melodies are catchy. the music seems like it was written during an adrenaline rush. actually every song is great, but my favourites are the brilliant opener &quot;arcarsenal&quot;, &quot;pattern against users&quot;, &quot;one armed scissors&quot; and &quot;mannequin republic&quot;. i also strongly recommend snapcase, refused and boy sets fire as other very good hardcore bands
B000059H98|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I know it did not do well at the box office, but I wish they would make Tank Girl II! The critics are too hard on movies.  Movie are meant to entertain and this one does that and more! Lori Petty was born to do this part. The story is fun, the music is great and you can watch it again and again and not get bored. WATCH IT, BUY IT!
6305205639|5.0|TRULY AN AMAZING VIDEO.  I HAVE THE BOX SET AND CLIFF EM ALL AND I LIKE HAVING SOME NEW STUFF IN MY COLLECTION OF VIDEOS.  THE STAGE RULES AND JUST EVERYTHING RULES.  DONT LISTEN TO THOSE FAKE FANS THAT GAVE THEM 1,2,3, OR EVEN 4 STARS. THOSE PEOPLE JUST DONT GET IT. THE BAND DESERVES 5 AND MORE BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORKED SO HARD FOR 20 YEARS AND ITS TIME THAT THE REAL FANS TELL THEM HOW GREAT THEY ARE. METALLICA RULES AND YOU GOTTA GET THIS VIDEO.  I ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT AND IF YOU'RE A REAL FAN, YOU WILL ENJOY IT TOO.
630575067X|1.0|i've never been so completely disappointed by a movie. Lucas let the special effects drive the story.. oh wait, what story? The only part of the movie which was even remotely well done was the pod race. maybe because it didn't really require too much acting. The characters were completely one dimensional, showing absolutely no passion whatsoever. <br />Star Wars meets disney is what it was. Jar Jar Binks (or whatever his name was) was the most annoying characters i have ever had the displeasure of seeing in a movie. <br />The movie was over before it even began: special effect, some dialogue, special effect, special effect some dialogue, etc.. movie over.<br />If i were lucas i would have thrown The Phantom Menace out and started again from scratch. if i could, i'd rate it negative stars .
B00003CXRP|2.0|First impressions last. The films beginning is long, not to mention cheesy. We first meet Chuck, our hapless workaholic FedEx employee, in Moscow where he's ranting and raving about time usage. Later we meet Helen Hunt, who's his equally busy girlfriend. Over Christmas [or somewhere around it], Chuck is called away for some emergency work. Before he leaves, Helen gives him a watch. In case the viewer hadn't picked up on it, the importance, or rather unimportance, of time is pounded into us from then on. This was one factor that made me angry about the film: it seems to assume the viewer is lacking the vital brain cells needed to pick up on plot elements.<br />After we wade our way through the drawn out opening, Chuck's plane takes a dive, and he finds himself stranded on an island. This is where the heart of the film lies. The whole point of it. So why, I ask, do the start and finish take up just as much time? Anyway, we watch as Chucky Boy moves from the stages of hope, to anger, to acceptance, and eventually to total desperation. In this desperation he creates a friend for himself, a ball named Wilson. Sounds ridiculous, and I suppose it is, but you can sympathise. You don't laugh at a grown man having a discussion with a ball. This is the mark of good story telling.<br />But, saddly, the ending doesn't follow through. It takes too long, and suddenly the walls seem fairly appealing. You might find yourself creating your own friend, naming him Alfredo, and discussing what it's like back out in the world.<br />The directing for the island parts is impressive, even poetic. Hanks gives a solid performance, but it could have been a bit more subtle. In fact, the whole film could have been.<br />The DVD looks to be loaded, so if you truly loved this movie, go for it. If you have yet to see it, I strongly suggest you rent it first.
B00000IP2L|4.0|This is one of the best heavy metal albums I've heard to date. The riffs are amazing, the leads are amazing, Zakk's voice is one of the best (alongside Phil Anselmo from Pantera and Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden). To one of the reviews below, if you have any doubts about Zakk's voice then listen to his acoustic album &quot;Book Of Shadows&quot;. The guitar has a sludgy but cool sound, the bass is fat and the piano (here and there) sounds chilling.<br />Just think: Zakk Wylde sings, plays all the guitar parts and piano parts and writes all the songs - the guy's a genius! This is an essential purchase to anyone interested in some real traditional metal. If you're looking for nu-metal you won't find it here. If you're looking for some down to earth, non-repetitive, proper heavy-metal, thats what you'll find. This is my favourite of the two Black Label Society albums due to the amount of variation, although Stronger Than Death is amazing as well. I recommend both of them!<br />Right from the opener &quot;Bored To Tears&quot;, the depressing &quot;Peddlers Of Death&quot;, the riff-frenzied &quot;Low Down&quot;, the cheeky acoustic solo &quot;T.A.Z.&quot;, the comedy of &quot;World Of Trouble&quot; right to &quot;The Beginning... At Last&quot;, this is one album that is as hard to put down as it is to forget. My version has a cover of Ozzy's &quot;No More Tears&quot; and I have to admit I do prefer the original (when Zakk was in the Ozzy solo band). Other than that, crank this up loud, annoy the neighbours and show all those Limp Bizkit fans some real metal!
B00005ATZT|5.0|One of the best remakes of an old movie/tv show i've ever seen.  Great action and terrific acting by some of Hollywood's finest (i.e. Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones).  A great movie that will keep you on edge til the end!
B000003TA4|2.0|This may be Nirvana's most famous album but it is also thier most commercial. Instead of the sludgy heavy production that greeted thier muisic with Bleach, this was lighter, crisper, cleaner and generally more radio-friendly. Some of the songs are excellent, but if this album had the production of Bleach, it would have been amazing. Many people rave about this album, whilst some people (even hardened Nirvana fans) moan about how it is thier least favourite album.<br />At first I loved it. Now I can't even remember the last time I listened to it. Just listen to the live version of Smell Like Teen Spirit - it's a million times better and contained all the angst, aggression and sheer energy that this album should've had. At the end of the day, this &quot;classic rock album&quot; fails to stike a chord with the people it REALLY should, and those people are a large amount of true Nirvana fans worldwide.<br />Lastly Cobain was not a genius.... Almost all of his songs had the same structures and the lryics don't mean anything most of the time (something else HE said in an interview).  If Nirvana didn't have so much commercial appeal and he didn't kill himself then they wouldn't be anymore popular than most other grunge bands. Oh, and Nirvana didn't invent grunge, neither do they define it.
B00003CXFG|5.0|One would think, this movie being a USA pictures release, that this movie would be incredibly poor and full of unnecessary junk.  WRONG.  This movie is a refreshing break from the 'Try-too-hard-to-be-Aliens' sci-fi movies.  Vin Diesel gives an EXCELLENT performance as the bad guy you just have to love.  Full of plot twists and surprises, the special effects are very good and the the entire movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Suspenseful, shocking, scary and all-out fun.  DON'T miss it!
0679879269|5.0|I just finished this book today. It was a moving, at times shattering experience. The emotion the writer manages to evoke in some of the scenes (like the one where Lyra is forced to leave her daemon, and of course the one where Lyra and Will actually realise they're in love!) is almost - well, I'm no writer and am probably putting it badly, but the effect was almost physical.I mean, I know I cried. I liked how Mr Pullman combines total innocence with sensuality in Lyra and Will's experiences. At the end, though, the writer's message - about this world being the only one that matters - seemed a little obvious and jarring.And while the most attractive characters in the book (again, by my standards) have got to be Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel I was a little unconvinced by Mrs Coulter's sudden change of heart - hell, even Asriel was! I totally agree with what earlier reviewers have said about this book: you do have to keep an open mind when reading it but I don't think your personal beliefs ought to have any effect on the way you respond to a good piece of fiction. And as for Lyra and Will being too young to fall in love, well, they're not ordinary pre-teens, are they? This is a great book that, apart from being a fun, interesting, engrossing story, also has serious things to say about the nature of good and evil, of religious beliefs, the process of growing up, and also about being human.
B00005221L|5.0|Of all the movies I have ever seen...no matter how spectacular the special effects, the acting, the script writing, anything....this movie is, and always will be, my favorite movie of all time.  Quite possibly Arnold's BEST movie, this movie is non-stop action.  An involved plot follows the story of a team of 5 Rescue Specialists and a CIA Operative who are dropped in a warzone somewhere in Central America.  A Guerilla camp has taken diplomatic hostages and it is up to Arnold and his team to rescue them.  However, when the team discovers another team of American soldiers horribly mutilated, suspicion begins to arise, and it soon becomes apparent that the real enemy is not of this world....... The entire movie is action-packed, full of Arnold's trademark grunts and groans.  The special effects are excellent and the environments are incredible.  The 'Predator' creature would go down in movie history as one of the most popular sci-fi creatures of all time, eventually clashing head to head with THE most popular creature ever, the Alien, in numerous comic book, novel, video game, card game, and action figure incarnations.  Arnold is a great hero and the final battle with the Predator is indeed a memorable one, sporting one of the most famous lines in Sci-Fi history.  DO NOT MISS THIS!
B0000028RR|5.0|If you are just getting into RATM, this is the place to start. Every song is good, hell every song is excellent! This is music meant to be played loud! The lyrics of Zack de la Rocha fume with politics and Tom Morello's unique guitar stylings accompany them perfectly. Looking back 20 years from now, this will be up their with &quot;Who's Next?&quot; and &quot;Zepplin 4&quot; as a classic album. Although de la Rocha left the band last year, the music and its message will not fade away anytime soon.
B00000IL1K|5.0|but this is easily one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Every time I listen to it, it just gets better.  A divine voice, and I'll even forgive her for re-doing Celine Dion's pop [stuff].
0399226907|5.0|My son (11 months now) Loves this book, he smiles whenever I start reading it &amp; he sticks his little fingers in the holes! I can't wait till he starts identifying the food the caterpillar eats! I recommend it to any new parent, It's a joy for you &amp; your child.
B000053V7Q|1.0|I just can't help believing!  (Actually, this is one of the songs that is not included on this DVD.  Can you believe it?)  I have no idea how to access to those &quot;Bonus Selections&quot; that are listed.  I think there must be something wrong with the production line.  Read the other reviews, they are all true:  all the great songs you like from the original version are gone!  To all disappointed fans, send a complaint to Turner Entertainment/Time Warner Home Video and ask them to get things right and replace the ones we have bought.
0783211856|3.0|The critical and commercial success of this slickly produced but ultimately hollow piece of Shoah-kitsch in 1993 has always puzzled me.  If Spielberg were any less than the master technician he is, I'd give this film one star.  The black-and-white photography, which so many have praised, is undeniably lovely in itself, but as a means of lending the story emotional impact and credibility, it is the single worst aesthetic decision Spielberg made for the film.  The technique, deliberately grainy to recall old newsreels, nicely distances the viewer from the action, and ensures that we see this as a story &quot;out of the past.&quot;  This might not have been the case had the cinematographer refrained from the annoying, pseudo-avant-garde technique (seen in every rock video!) of shooting carefully selected fragments (such as the now-famous red coat) in color, another aesthetic decision that calls attention to itself and prevents the viewer from fully identifying with the characters.  Second, for all its &quot;authenticity&quot; (the production design is truly remarkable), the film is filled with the usual Spielbergian cheap, manipulative and blatant emotional appeals - it is an insult to everyone who died in Auschwitz to replicate the style (but not the substance, since the characters aren't actually going to be killed) of the Zyklon-B shower deaths as a suspense scene - this is one of the most sickening things I have ever seen in a movie.  Additionally, huge portions of the script are obvious lifts from such telefilms as John Hersey's THE WALL, about the Warsaw Ghetto, HOLOCAUST, and even THE WINDS OF WAR, such as the woman's killing of her infant to keep it silent lest its crying betray the group...The final sequence, where all of the surviving &quot;Schindler's Jews&quot; are paraded around in living color only underscores the sleaziness of Spielberg's cheap melodrama.  The film also distorts the facts - Oskar Schindler was no &quot;hero&quot; (which the movie at least recognizes), nor was he the only industrialist who made huge profits from using cheap Jewish and prisoner slave labor during the war.  After this film was released, several of the survivors revealed far more ambivalent attitudes towards Schindler than you will see in this film - he may have saved most of their lives, but he also worked them like drayhorses and made money off of them anyway.  I will commend the uniformly fine performances, but this film is wildly overrated.  See A. Holland's EUROPA EUROPA for a film with an almost identical structure to this one, that even incorporates the &quot;real&quot;people at the end without seeming manipulative.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Best Picture 2000... that should be enough.  When I saw this movie in the theater, I was absolutely transfixed.  I have never scene a more incredibly detailed, beautiful and exciting epic in my life.  The moment the war began at the start of the film, I was glued to my seat.  The visuals of Rome and the Colluseum were breathtaking.  Russel Crowe...Best Actor 2000...he's the man.  Joaquin Phoenix SHOULD have won Best Supporting Actor... I don't know what movie the judges were watching... Incredible cinematography, top notch acting and heart-stopping action wrapped into one beautiful package.  This movie is one of the best you may ever see.
0679879269|4.0|I have just finished Philip Pullman's trilogy and found each volume yielded up a treasure-chest of delights and surprises.  The great strength of the books lies in the author's ability to create worlds which seem as real as our own and to people them with characters with whom readers can sympathise and identify.  Younger readers will enjoy being swept along in a fast-moving stream of adventure, while older readers and adults will appreciate the literary references and philosophical issues raised in the plot.  <br />My only reservations about The Amber Spyglass is that sometimes the author seems to have bitten off more than he can chew and has difficulty keeping all the strands of thought and action together.  The style of writing also tends towards the verbose in this final volume.  Therefore I enjoyed the first two books more. Nevertheless there is no denying the achievement of the author in creating such a large cast of vivid characters and painting detailed pictures of imaginary worlds and beings. Like many other readers, I was moved to tears by the portrayal of the love between Will and Lyra.   Those who object to the &quot;anti-Christian&quot; sentiments in the book should think more carefully.  It is precisely this kind of narrow-minded intolerance that Pullman appears to condemn.  Indeed, one of the few pure &quot;villains&quot; in the trilogy appears in the final book in the form of the fanatical priest, Father Gomez, and he comes to a bad end....There are many positive ideas in the books, such as the importance of love, loyalty and friendship, which are not out of keeping with Christian ideals.<br />To sum up, I would highly recommend this and the other two books (they must be read in order) in the Dark Materials trilogy to anyone who enjoys a good story which is well-told, gives plenty of food for thought and which will linger in the imagination long after the last page is turned.  It will appeal to adults and younger readers alike. I think younger readerswho have read widely of other literature (e.g. C.S. Lewis, English poetry, the Greek myths, etc.) will get even more out of it.
B00003CXDG|1.0|What the h-e-double hockey sticks is this?  First of all, the makers of the first MI dared to do the unthinkable...they not only killed Jim Phelps, but they made him the bad guy... talk about sacrilege!  Now, in MI:2, they take what could be a fantastic franchise, add a terrible plot, throw in some bad actors (excluding Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins) and &quot;spice&quot; it up with Mortal Kombat Kung-Fu moves expecting it to be a good movie...well, how about no?  Garbage. That's about all this movie is.  Utter garbage.  I would much rather watch the old tv show.  The ONLY positive thing I have to say is that Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins were in this one...acting very well as usual.  As for the rest of the movie...what a let down!  We miss you Mr. Graves!
B00003CXPD|4.0|Billy Elliot is an inspiring British film about Billy, who boxes, but finds that he enjoys doing ballet more.  But, he has big family problems.  His brother doesn't want to be seen with a brother doing ballet, and his father just hates the idea.  These conflicts build up the movie.  Everyone gives great performances, especially the ballet teacher (Julie Walters).  Only one disadvantage:  (I think) subtitles are a must in some cases, because of the british accents.  This was still a great film, and a must-see DVD.
B00003Q438|5.0|Simply excellent.  The Abyss was already a favorite of mine after seeing it in the theaters, it's even better with the expanded scenes.  It's another great, original work from the director of Aliens and Terminator...not to mention Titanic, the biggest money-maker of all time.<br />Movie aside, whether or not you liked the movie, you HAVE to see the making of the abyss.  This WILL give you a healthy respect for the movie, the actors and everything involved with bringing this film to life.  I had no doubt after watching it that this had to be the most incredibly difficult film to ever have been made!<br />The Abyss is a great sci-fi flick.  It's entertaining and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Five Stars...two thumbs up...what else can I say?  Check it out!
0553213105|5.0|I must admit that when I finally finished reading Pride and Prejudice I wish I hadn't finished.  This is by far the best story i have ever read in my short life.  This woman is one of the best writers I have ever encountered and this novel got me hooked.  I was so detirmined to finish it that i stayed up all night long reading. I could not wait to see what was ever to become of Elizabeth and Darcy.  I started reading it as an assignment for my 9th grade honors english class one week ago and was kicking myself at the end of the book for not reading it on my own.  I have now started Sense and Sensibility but I am sure that nothing could be as good as Pride and Prejudice.  If anyone hasnt read this you are missing out on a great story.  I have yet to see the mini series but i plan on borrowing it from my teacher.  I urge everyone to experience Pride and Prejudice.
B000006NPY|5.0|The first Pumpkins album I bought was Mellon Collie, and from my first listening of it I was hooked.  The Pumpkins are probably my favorite band, with their amazing musical talent, and of course Billy Corgan.  His voice is so unique and his lyrics are unbelievably beautiful, poetic and truthful.  I know there are those out there that love the Pumpkins but hate this album.  Personally, I can't understand it.  To me Adore is beyond anything they'd ever done before and is unspeakable beautiful and sad.  Many times the songs on this album have made me cry... they touch something in me I guess.   Okay, I'll try to finish this up, my favorite songs on Adore are the ones I find the saddest- Tear, Crestfallen, Annie-Dog, To Martha, and Blank Page.  I think this is an amazing album, but unique and unlike standard Pumpkins, so I see how some could be thrown off guard by it and not give it a chance. But it truly it a musical masterpiece.
6302256615|5.0|I remember when I saw the trailers for this film so long ago I thought how stupid could a film get.  A bunch of guys robbing banks in masks of the ex-presidents.  So I never bothered to see it in the theater.  I missed out.<br />This film is phenomenal.  And I have to give Keanu Reeves credit.  He has a good understanding of what will work on film even though his acting talents are less than exemplary.  But he was great in Point Break as a young hot shot FBI agent assigned to hunt down the ex-presidents.  <br />Point Break has all the elements that make a film for alot of guys: action, conflict, comedy, some sweet chicks, and ultimately redemption.  It just grabs you from the start and never lets you go.  Makes me wish that I could surf and chase bad guys and lay up with Lori Petty.  Patrick Swayze was great as Boedi the self appointed leader of the ex-presidents.<br />A can't go wrong film!
0452282152|5.0|I was very surprised to see a negative review of this book.  The review suggested that this book lacked momentum.  This book, indeed, is far more than a simple, unfolding plot.  This is a book with rich characters and rich description of the Dutch society, culture and scenery of 17th century.  While the very romantic story-line is subtle in many ways, it is the more meaningful for it and held me spellbound over the day and a half over which I read it.  I read &quot;Tulip Fever&quot; (by Moggach) immediately afterwards, in the hopes that it would be a repeat of Chevalier's book.  It's story-line and characters seemed so simplistic and formulaic in comparison to &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; and left me very disappointed.  &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is really a treasure.
B000006TRV|5.0|First of all: buy this record right now and then come back to read the reviews and see what a great album you've just bought. Now, let's talk about it. The Wall is a masterpiece, unequalled. It shows Pink Floyd at their very best.  Roger Waters' lyrics on isolation and alienation are terrific. The music is absolutely wonderful. Another Brick In The Wall, Mother, Young Lust, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, Run Like Hell... the list goes on and on. Milestones. Songs that are part of public conscience. And of course, Mr. David Gilmour... listen to Gilmour's solos and you'll find out why he is one of the greatest guitar players to ever grace the face of Earth. Mother and Comfortably Numb have probably the most beautiful guitar solos ever. If you NEVER heard anything of The Wall, you won't regret. You're buying the best album ever recorded.
B000059ZLH|3.0|Ok, this really came as a disapointment to me and I really feel bad to have to write this. What do I mean? Well, the concert was great! I saw the tour in Orlando at the House of Blues and I was WOWED!!! Dream Theater is a really impressive band, with more talent behind them than any other single band today. Metropolis Part II: Scenes from a Memory is probably one of the best pieces of work I have ever heard from Dream Theater, let alone 90% of the other bands out there. The concert was a perfect recreation of the album with nothing left out. Just a straight shot through with some minor differences here and there. <br />Now, I'm sure you're asking &quot;how could he be giving this DVD only three stars when he is praising the album so much&quot;? Let me assure you it was a hard thing to decide on a three star review for one of the best concerts I have ever seen, with one of the best albums I have ever heard, and one of the most talented bands around... <br />For starters, lets start with the disc being in pan and scan (Full Screen). In this so-called &quot;High Definition&quot; world that we are entering, pan and scan is a joke. Luckily this is just shots of the stage, but most of you know that a Pan &amp; Scan disc cuts off the edges of the full picture to crop it on to a normal 4:3 television. What about those people who have a 16:9 set or plan on purchasing a Widescreen TV in the near future? I was really hoping for a widescreen release of this concert with animorphic enhancements, but that didn't happen! There goes one star...<br />Next, 2.0 Dolby Surround sound... What went wrong here? This film was recorded in the year 2000. The same year DVD Audio was released! The same year that Super Audio Compact Discs were brought out on the market. The same year that every new film is either encoded in DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1 and the Dream Theater DVD has none of the above. I guess the folks at Elektra and whoever mastered the audio tracks on this disc found it unimportant to give all of us audiophiles out here a great sound track. I don't get it... Eric Clapton and The Eagles got DTS encodings with Clapton's Unplugged show and the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over concert. What a big upset to Dream Theater fans when all we get was a two-channel stereo source. Thank God for Pro Logic, DTS Neo 6 and the up and coming Pro Logic 2. But still, I'd appreciated a 5.1 audio encoding of some sort. There goes the other star to make it only a 3 star review. <br />Those were the downfalls to Dream Theater's first DVD release. Sorry I had to tear it apart, but I'm sure others will be very disapointed with a lot of the aspects to this DVD. I'm looking at it from a technical view. I couldn't have been any happier with the Metropolis album, nor could I have ever been disappointed with the concert. That would have been hard to ruin ;) But, I'm glad this DVD has finally been released. I have been awaiting it since November when I first heard the news of a DVD release. I just find it odd that it had been pushed back from early Feb to late April and it was released with the most basic features. <br />Well, I just have to say it!!! Great Concert, perfect album, but the DVD is nowhere near perfection. Overall, I would give my ultimate recommendations to purchasing this DVD. There is absolutely no reason why this disc should not be in your collection, however I do pray for an Ultimate Edition in the future with some more bonus material and better audio encoding. Widescreen would be a plus too!<br />Do your self a favor! Buy it. Watch it. Enjoy it. Because, it is Dream Theater's first, and only DVD yet.
0380796090|2.0|I liked this book.<br />Despite the fact that I found it unbelievable and wanted many times to smack various characters, this book is perfect for the day at the pool with a margarita in one hand and a novel in the other.<br />For much more than that, I fear it will fall short.<br />I get the sense that the author sat down and made up the entire story as she went along.  The majority of characters are caricatures of old standards, and they all contain that particular quirk or eccentricity particular to characters in novels of British origin.  But they are funny.<br />It's froth, of the type found on milkshakes.  But then, an occasional milkshake isn't such a bad thing.
B000056NX5|1.0|This is pitiful - it was pitiful on Broadway, and deservedly didn't last long.  It &quot;updated&quot; the 70's move, pretty bad on it's own, to a modern setting.  Best advice...pay no attention to the early movie and even less to this one.  Buy the original cast CD, sit back and listen to a great musical work and a believable (accurate?  I don't know) retelling of the last days of Christ.
1573225517|4.0|This is the masculine Bridget Jones.<br />Really.<br />There's not much more to say!  This guy, while British and not really familiar to me on that basic cultural level, does indeed seem afflicted with the identifiable young-adult syndrome experienced by both sexes which crosses boundaries of time and space.  While Bridget (whom I really do see as his feminine literary counterpart) smokes too much and drinks too much and ruminates too much to deal with her intrinsic insecurities, this guy does what many guys do to find similar consolation: buys records, talks to his lame buddies, and pines for women, especially the object of his affection who formerly rejected him.<br />It's funny.  Men would like it.  Occasionally, I found myself irritated by the unerring stupidity of some of the characters; while I'm sure the author did that on purpose, I found it annoying enough nonetheless to eliminate one star.
6302787564|5.0|The dictionary defines a community as a group of people having common interests. Well, if you look around you do you see anyone sharing common interests? Heck no. When I look around I just see a bunch of multi-cultural &quot;subjects&quot; paying taxes to the government. Like the lyrics of a certain MDFMK song describe, &quot;WE ONLY BUY INTO WHAT WE CAN SELL.&quot; If your not economically viable then, well... I guess your obsolete. So much for living in a real &quot;community&quot;. <br />We're all a bunch of slaves if you ask me. Liberty is just the right to do what the law permits. Of course we're free to pick which cancer-ridden cheeseburger to eat, which car to buy, which house to mortgage, and which plot of land to lease until we die (by the way, who gave the U.S. government permission to sell the land in the first place?). Even after you die the government still owns you-- by law you have to be taken to the morgue, your cold, dead body has to be photographed by some sort of inspector, basically they own you; and then they plop you down into some shallow grave, which also costs money-- heaven knows a person can't be burried unless their in an official cemetary plot. I think that I'll go out into the woods when I'm ready to die and just let the animals eat me or something-- better than having Big Brother catalog me on a piece of paper and then burry me in one of their private-corporation grave yards, yep cemetaries are buisnesses too, they have to make a profit. What's the going rate for a casket these days? Probably triple digits. Give me a break. Western society is so bent on money.<br />Anyway, this movie is awesome, it's one of my all-time favorites.
B00004TFK3|2.0|Ok the story as an absolute story is not bad, actually it's somehow interesting. The animation is perfect and well done too. I think this is the best film ever for Will Smith! Oh yes, and you may accept this movie as a light commedy.<br />One of the main downfalls of this movie was that the Science Fiction side of the film was badly affected when the story got framed into commedy! In other words, the suspense was dead!<br />Some of you are comparing this movie with Star Wars or Aliens... I think this is not right! Nor Star Wars or Aliens was a commedy! Instead the suspense was very genuine and the movie turned out to be very powerful Science Fictions!<br />Anyway, this movie maybe worth seeing once or twice... but I do not recommend buying it unless you are a big fan of Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones!
B00000J6AG|1.0|This album is just awful.  I bought it expecting something completely different, like content.  It's just a series of sampling tracks, as if Fatboy Slim teamed up with the mid 90's group &quot;Beautiful People&quot; for a duets album.  It has one redeeming quality...I think it would be a valuable resource for an avertising exec for commercial music.  I recognized two tracks that are currently background music in TV commercials.  And don't get me started on the liner notes.  Moby missed their audience with my purchase.  My dog liked it though, he's crunching on it now.
1573300403|4.0|The songs are brilliant, the Sound &amp; Picture are great! What I liked the most was the teaser at the beginning and the ending Treasure Chest!!!<br />You cannot take this as the only MJ greatest songs, there are so many great ones that are not included on this DVD... plus this DVD has no extras at all. But no matter what better have it and hope that other DVDs of his are to come.
0792846443|4.0|I do not like Stephen King's books, or the adaptations of them to film but, despite this I saw MISERY. I watched this for one reason, and one reason only: to see Kathy Bates's Oscar winning performance. I'm so glad I did. Not only is Ms. Bates brilliant, James Caan is superb, and the direction... simply flawless. Excellent cinematography, as well as a great score. A MUST- SEE for anyone interested in 2 hours of pure entertainment.
B00004U8H4|1.0|I cannot understand what others may see in this meaningless weak erogant bad acting psycho!!!<br />For God's sake the acting was bad, the story is meaningless, the scenes are weak... no plot, nor a twist or anything worth watching.<br />The actor did a great job to make me hate his acting and this film... the director did an extremely bad job as well. I did not read the book, maybe it was much better and that's why I blame the director and the actor for this ...(balony)!<br />Don't make my mistake and buy this DVD, if you are that curious go and rent it first then you decide.<br />The one star is only for the nice DVD cover and an interesting title of the film... the remaining is worth no stars!

0780631684|1.0|So many people that I know liked this movie... obviously here at Amazon.com as well! But to tell you the truth to me this movie is nothing but a big F.<br />The trailor made me believe that this is the new &quot;SCREAM&quot; or &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;... the beginning of the movie was so perfect! Until the plane crash took place, the movie itself got killed too!<br />There's so much exaggeration in the story that the viewer's mind can no more accept it and go with it....<br />Sorry to all the fans of this movie... but as for me I am truly sorry for watching this!
B000059R8Y|2.0|The persons responsible for supplying music for elevators and hospital waiting rooms will love this album. Die-hard Clapton fans will buy it just to have it. Everyone else, listen to it before you decide to buy it.
0783233477|4.0|The idea of the film is one of a kind, the story is well told and the acting is so great!<br />This could be one of the very best movies for Anthony Hopkins! Claire Forlani was so beautiful, sexy and perfect. This movie is the only good movie for Claire Forlani.<br />The emotions in this movie are so genuine and Anthony's speech at the end of the movie is BRILLIANT!<br />Good drama, good actors, one of a kind story and very surprising. I highly recommend watching this movie if not buying it.
B00004W5UA|5.0|An amazing movie. If anyone hasn't seen it, I highly suggest it. The direction is amazing, as is the writing. The acting is not the only part that makes this movie captivating. It is worth watching at least twice in a row, I know I did. A new aspect will be noticed each time you watch it. The characterization is wonderful, as is the writing, and the very basis. Keep your eyes open, it's an experience. Join the fight.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I would consider the task not being able to even snicker once through this entire movie would be impossible. It's fantastic. When I was watching it for the first time ever, my brother fell out of his chair because he was laughing so hard! It's excellent for people the age of 5 through who the heck knows! A superb masterpiece to add to your Disney collection.
6305041156|4.0|RAN is one of the few films that, should a global disaster strike Earth, deserves to be put in a time capsule for future generations to find after they climb from the rubble to rebuild everything.<br />Based loosely on Shakespeare's King Lear (with more than a passing nod to Macbeth), RAN proves the paradox that the more culturally specific a work of art, the more universal are its themes.  In 16th-century Japan, old Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is nearing the end of his life, and so decides to essentially split his kingdom among his three sons, under the command of his eldest.  His youngest son, Saburo (Ryu Daisuke), counsels strongly against it; he knows the motives of his brothers all too well.  But Hidetora, in his hubris, believes himself the wiser.  He disowns Saburo - the only one of his sons who truly has his best interest at heart - and lives to regret it.<br />For Western audiences especially, the very &quot;foreign-ness&quot; of RAN throws its bitter meditation on human nature into sharp relief.  Like the best works of art, RAN's strong, elegant, simple design expresses both great aesthetic beauty and Spartan functionality.  Not a moment is wasted; not a single composition haphazard or thoughtless.  Watching it is a bit like falling into a profound dream.<br />RAN really deserves the THX treatment, and given the respect that Kurosawa's work commands among filmmakers, it is shameful that at least one of them has not yet stepped forward to do so.  As it stands, this DVD lacks the sharpness and fidelity due its subject, although I actually like the off-center letter boxing, as it allows the subtitles to appear below the picture without covering it.  Given RAN's extraordinary imagery, that is a blessing.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I got this cd for my bithday a year ago, i just heard the song &quot;higher&quot;. Then when i heard &quot;what if&quot; i hated it but when i heard the cd  listend to some of the songs. Then later i started to listen to all of them and now i love all of them. the best songs aree &quot;With arms wide open&quot; &quot;wash those years away&quot; and &quot;what if&quot;. This album has so many things that you can pick up the deep meaning. I still listen to this cd every day, get it and you'll love it.
B00003CXFG|3.0|Great movie, though doesn't explain why a night creature is on top of the food chain when 99.9 percent of the time it's daylight.  Unless these creatures weren't indigenous to the planet to begin with, were introduced by the miners/colonizers/visitors which upset the ecological balance of the planet, and laid waste everything in it's path.  That would explain why they were so destructive to the environment.  Or maybe the planet fell out of orbit and the surface life died (which were bountiful or hearty enough to survive the night creatures attack) because of the constant heat and not the night creatures.  So, again the ecology got thrown out of balance.  It's science fiction, so anything is possible.<br />Anyway, the real reason I'm writing is because of Claudia Black.  This is the first time I've seen her anywhere and I was absolutely stricken.  I hadn't even heard of Farscape yet until a week ago.  Claudia Black is now on my top ten babe-a-licious list.  Wow, I wish I could say more about her, but I'm going to be a male pig about this.  Claudia, you are the jam in my jellyroll, the whip cream on my banana sundae with tiny chocolate sprinkles on top, and the fluoride in my toothpaste.   Anyway, I think you get the point.  Oh yeah, your a pretty good actor too.  You have to be a good actor to split yourself in two like that.  Doesn't that hurt?

B0000026WD|5.0|Dangerous is Michael Jackson's true masterpiece. In every sense of the word, it fits its description to a T. <br />There have been few pop albums since, in fact no pop albums since, which have been able tolive up to the standards set by this brilliantly conceived album. <br />From the beginning the sound and the music take the listener on a journey that no other Michael Jackson album has done before or since. <br />'Jam' the first cut, shines with electronic bleeps and a pounding beat. Pure dance pop.<br />'Why You Wanna Trip On Me' is, in my opinion, one of the best Jackson tracks ever. And with his catalogue, that's a noble feat. The lyrics are what make this one great. More personal than anything from 'Off The Wall', 'Thriller' or 'Bad', combined. <br />'In The Closet' is another great Jackson track. Great beat, driving sexual lyrics and a mystery guest vocal (Princess Stephanie of Monnaco). This song is a classic all the way, and completely unerplayed now.<br />'She Drives Me Wild' has got a great hook, great beat and great lyrics. Why was this not a hit? With seven other songs released from this monster album, it just couldn't be, but has every bit of potential as the others.<br />'Remember The Time' is classic Jackson. Everything in it makes you wanna move. And that's the great thing about Michael Jackson is his ability to make you wanna get up and dance! This song is pure irresistable pop.<br />'Can't Let Her Get Away' is another great song. I've got nothing else to say, except it is slammin'.<br />'Heal The World' could possibly be Michael's answer to 'We Are The World' from the 80's. It is a beautiful song, with great lyrics. Michael's voice shines and the production is wonderful. Another classic cut.<br />'Black Or White' is in my opinion, a theme song for the 90's. It is a great song with a killer guitar riff through-out, and it has super meaningful lyrics. It could have been a bit longer in my opinion because I'm kind of let down it only runs at 4:00 with about a 1 minute introduction. Never-the-less, classic.<br />'Who Is It' is the best track on the entire album. His best song since 'Billie Jean' and the main reason that to this day I am in love with Michael Jackson's music. Awesome lyrics, killer bass line (like 'Billie Jean') and beautiful orchestration. Another classic.<br />'Give In To Me' has got a guitar solo by Slash of Guns N' Roses, raw emotion and great lyrics. What can I say, except another classic!<br />'Will You Be There' is beautiful. Simply put. Just beautiful. This song showcases why Michael Jackson is the master of his game. In all honesty, one of the best songs ever written.<br />'Keep The Faith' is wonderful. The 'Man In The Mirror' of the 90's and the second best track on this album. I have never heard a pop song in recent years with half the meaning of this one. Buy it and you'll hear why. The lyrics are somthin' else.<br />'Gone Too Soon' finds Michael delivering his best vocal work since the 'Off The Wall' album. 'Childhood' off of 'HIStory' showcases the same vocal beauty as this.<br />'Dangerous' is electrifying. A classic song to end off the greatest album in POP history. And I'm not kidding folks!<br />This album shows the Michael Jackson we (well about 100 million of us) all fell in love with. The man who creates music for the ages. Not the man who lives in the tabloids and press.<br />Buy it for the music and the genius it is. <br />But watch out for September 18th, 2001. Michael Jackson will be back and might possibly surpass this album in every form when he releases his new album. <br />Five Out Of Five
B000002IZ4|5.0|Without a doubt the best Stone Temple Pilots Album ever. Deep moody base, dark complex lyrics and some smashing leed work. Swinging from the upbeat and fast paced 'Army ants' to the harrowing, sad emptyness of Kitchenware and candy bars. If you liked there earlier works you will love 'purple'.
6304117302|2.0|Ok, I just watched this film last night.  After browsing amazon.com for good reviews on a classic adventure movie like BRAVEHEART, I came across LAST OF THE MOHICANS.  I dowloaded a few songs from the soundtrack and fell in love with the music. Naturally, I had to see the movie.<br />I'll get to the point...THE MUSIC AND SCENERY WAS AWESOME.  I thought the acting was NOT up to par, I thought the love story was completely underdeveloped and I thought the script was horrible.  I was completely lost the first 45 minutes and so was my mother, who teaches Cooper's novel. BUT...I have to say, the ending scene was beautifully done--visually. <br />Anyway, go buy the soundtrack--that's where the real magic of this movie is. <br />Anyone agree with me on this...because I see many great reviews for the film on here...honestly, I thought it was semi-cruddy.
0780628551|1.0|This movie is a SLOW Rosemary's Baby from outer space.  'Nuff said!
B00003XB8K|5.0|Why do you people hate Modern Crusaders so much? All right, I agree that MC's shouting is mediocre, but I have heard songs a lot worse before, like those silly heavy metal screaming. And I think combining O Fortuna and heavy beats is simply cool, as in Track 9. I really hope they had extended the track.
6305169187|1.0|This film is not worth watching - it's kids stuff. The action on Earth is simplistic but just about watchable. The action in space is plain trash. They seem to have gone for just about every movie cliche possible - too many to list here - but the 'stupid' Russian astronaut part is particularly tasteless.
B000001FI7|5.0|I can not really recall the first time I heard Portishead, but then I guess that it is because this album has never left my stereo for more than a few days at a time since. It is the definitive mood music and I really enjoy just laying in bed listening to Beth Gibbons just pour her heart out. If ever my heart is broken, I listen to this and it makes it more bearable. When I first heard this album I realized that this album was from a group destined for greatness, I put it in a category with debut works such as RATMs first album and the Smashing Pumpkins Gish. If, for some reason you dont own this album, buy it NOW! It is one of the best five albums I own and I will personaly give you your money back if you dont like it.
1884822312|4.0|This is a great book for players of AVERAGE strength. (1300-1750) (Players outside this rating range may not get as much value from this book.)<br />Its a big book of problems. As a Chess Master, I can confidently say you will find problems for ANY level player. From a 'Mate in One' for a beginner, to mates in three or more. Plus there are game fragments and short games in here also. AND a section on tactics and combinations.<br />Just the size of this book alone makes it a value. It will entrtain any chess playing family for years to come.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Geddy Lee's powerful vocals in this album are strongly evident.  The music both lyrical and poetic casts the listener into state of both delight and wonder.  Of all the music I have ever owned, this is one of the albums that stands out in my mind as one I can listen to over and over.  The Title song, Xanadu, Closter To The Heart and Cinderella Man.... there is very little if anything on this album not to like.  If you love classic RUSH and do not own this set, you are missing a keystone to RUSH's legacy in music.
B000000OQF|5.0|With my father being such a music aficionado, he recommended this album to me when I was about 12.  Of course, I had already heard such classics like Paradise City and Welcome to the Jungle on the radio before, but I didn't know what to expect from the other tracks.  The first year or so I had it, I listened to it just for those 2 songs.  I kind of thought of them as a bad image band (which they were of course) but damn one night I played the whole CD through and every song was just so catchy.  It seemed that as the CD went along the songs kept sounding better culminating with my current favorite track, Rocket Queen.  The songs flow extremely well and soon enough I found it to be one of the best hard rock albums ever.  I mean ever since 1988 when this came out, I don't think anything can compare to this album.  It's purely a shame that after this one, they went down the tubes because Appetite is so good.  Also I recommend the Live Era CD for that is high energy and has most of the Appetite cuts on it
B00000IAU3|5.0|I liked dido from the first time i heard her part on &quot;stan&quot;. Thank you is a great song, but there are other great songs on this cd too, like 'here with me', 'don't think of me' and 'i'm no angel'. her voice is incredible and the songs are catchy. i think she's a cross between joni mitchell and nelly furtado with a little of enrique iglesias' style.
0786915749|2.0|While I'm out of step with most reviewers, I found Dragons to be an unconvincing read.  The authors do not spend the time to create a realistic historical, geographical, linguistic, or anthropological background for their world or Krynn and its inhabitants.  The religions are especially underdeveloped, given the central role that they are intended to play in the good versus evil quest.  Rather they take the shortcut of relying on achetypes from Tolkien and TSR to guide their readers:  elves, mages, dwarves, etc.  The sole new entries are Kenders and Gully Dwarves (good guys), and Draconians (bad guys), and those only serves to highlight how unimaginative the authors were.   The overall impression is of unoriginality and cliche.  <br />Further there are several loose ends not tied up at the end.  Raistlin and Caramon's half sister Kitiara, who ominously failed to show for the long planned meeting at the book's openning, never reappears to play a role.  Why then do the authors introduce this plot twist?  The &quot;person&quot; to whom Goldmoon is to deliver the disks of Mishakal, probably he is Berem the Green Gemstone Man, has no ultimate role despite being set up as the quest of the book.<br />Perhaps these are to be resolved in subsequent volumes.  But the effect is unconvincing.  I for one won't read on to find out if there is any redemption to be had, that is too high a mountain for them to climb.
6305131090|4.0|This is a rather bizzare movie on the life of the Austrian composer Gustav Mahler.  Then again, perhaps it would be borderline impossible for anyone to conceive of a movie about Mahler which was not bizarre.  The movie makes an attempt to reconstruct the psychology of an artistic genius, one who was so inspired by the works of Beethoven, Wagner, Goethe, Nietzsche &amp; Novalis.<br />The film takes place aboard a train; Mahler and his wife are both travelling on board.  The trainride sees Mahler indulge in a number of flashbacks and nightmares, all of which provide the vehicle for Ken Russell to divulge the more salient episodes of Mahler's life.  Among these are his childhood artistic inspirations, the rocky relationships he had with his wife &amp; family and the unfortunate but infamous encounter he had with the emperor of Austria.<br />As a biography of a composer, this one does not rank up there with &quot;Amadeus,&quot; &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; or Richard Burton's &quot;Wagner.&quot;  However, it does do a credible job of engaging some of the more memorable epochs of his life, as well as his incessant infatuation with death. There are also some intentional anachronisms, such as his &quot;meeting&quot; with Cosima Wagner.<br />Far more important though, is the introspective look which the movie offers on the isolated existence of a tormented genius.  The continual anguish of this friendly, misanthropic megalomaniac is felt throughout.  Someone once asked Mahler, &quot;How could a man as kind-hearted as you have written a symphony so full of suffering?&quot; &quot;It is,&quot; replied Mahler, &quot;the sum of all the suffering I have been compelled to endure at the hands of life.&quot;  Such is the theme of this movie.  Such was the theme of Mahler's life.  It is a theme sometimes gruesome, sometimes hauntingly beautiful, and always gripping.  See this movie, and hear the theme for yourself.
B00000099Y|4.0|i worked at a record store awhile back, and i remember every time a customer would bring this CD up to the register, i'd get all giddy and go &quot;ooooh! look at the cover! this is so cool!&quot; (the little eyes move around it kind of like a flip card...but better) Then I found out by listening that the songs Stinkfist and Aenima were songs I'd heard on my alterna-rock station and liked a lot. (forgive me, o devout and die-hard Tool fans, I only recognized that these songs were by Tool once I found out that Tool was the other band of the lead singer of Perfect Circle--mer de noms, that's a great album too). So in otherwords, to people who were like me and had only heard Tool songs on the radio, this CD has two of the aired singles--and some more good songs... and buy it just to go play with the &quot;magic&quot; cd cover when you're in *altered states of mind*...that is if you're into that sort of thing...have fun!
0783225733|5.0|Now I don't usually give 5-star reviews, but movies this good aren't usually put into theaters. I usually stick to fiction, historical fiction, and sci-fi movies,(like Star Wars, Grease, and Princess Bride)and comedy(like anything by Mel Brooks.)But this movie has elements from all of those, minus the fiction and most of the comedy. It is a serious movie about a serious story from the last century. And not only is it very entertaining, but while you're watching it, you keep saying to yourself &quot;this really happened.&quot; The real Jim Lovell(who Tom Hanks played in the movie)saw the movie before it's public debut. He said that it was very accurate, and his wife said that Kathleen Quinlan's (she played Marilyn Lovell) hair in the movie(it was a wig) looked exactly like her hair had at the time.   Ken Mattingly(played by Garry Sinise)was my favorite character. While he wasn't the star or the obvious hero, he basically brought them home. He was the one who got into the simulator, and who figured out how to suck every available amp outta that ship to get his pals home.
1883217040|5.0|Concise and entertaining text; Clear analysis with excellent musical examples; The section on Chord/Scale applications alone is worth the price; Check out Levine's analysis of Coltrane changes: he makes this complex harmonic device comprehensible, and even manageable! This is the last theory book I'll ever need.
0671027344|5.0|I loved this book!  This was recommended to me by someone 10 years my junior, so I was a bit leery.  But I have to say this really took me back to my time as a high school freshman.  The euphoria of making friends (with upper-class men no less) when you think you're in for four years of lonliness.  Discovering &quot;cool&quot; music like the Smiths, Nick Drake or U2.  Smoking your first cigarette, your first joint.  Feeling like you're just an observer of life, rather than a participant.  The author writes with a voice that rings so true you forget this is fiction.  At the end I wanted to go to my mailbox and find a letter from Charlie.
B000051VWW|4.0|LOVERS ROCK has been my most anticipated album of the last 5 years, EASILY. I'm more than glad Sade didn't feel she had to deliver an album that sounded like her previous work. Some reviewers have said they were disappointed by the sound and style on the new album. I guess some of her fans were expecting more of the same music. It's great that Sade is taking her music in a different direction. In my opinion she's doing what she wants and that's why she continues to deliver the goods every time. Even if she makes us wait 8 years, it was worth it.<br />I'll admit I do miss of the &quot;jazzier&quot; elements of Diamond Life (my absolute favorite) with saxophone and drums. But, the songwriting and the overall production are amazing. Sade doesn't disappoint especially on my favorites: King of Sorrow, Slave Song, Immigrant, It's The Love That Gets You Through and the unbelievably moving Somebody Already Broke My Heart. I can play that one song over and over again, and never tire of it. Too bad the local radio stations in Denver don't take the time to play ANYTHING off this new album. Only one radio station, which is mostly contemporary jazz, will play her, and even then infrequently. Would be nice if her label would put some marketing power behind this. It is a classic for Sade fans all over the planet!
0679735259|5.0|I first read this book while in journalism school in the late 70's. There was constant discussion in our classrooms about the coverage of Viet Nam. We had professors who had covered the war. Mr. Herr's book took us there and let us experience it for ourselves. What better compliment could be paid to a journalist? I've read it numerous times since college. It chills me still.

0312243022|4.0|I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. Cunningham's writing style is very easy on the eyes, and brain. The imagery of Manhattan really hit home. I've only been there 3 times, but every time he went to paint that picture, I felt like he was describing home. The other 2 or 3 scenarios were similarly enjoyable. All the characters were created and shaped with just as much attention to making this book a personal experience for the reader. HOWEVER, the cheesey plot culmination at the end, I could have done without. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book, but I spotted the end at about halfway through the book.
B00002DEOL|5.0|Not only is Rocket to Russia THE best punk album of all time, it is also one of the best Rock n Roll albums of all time. There is not a false step from beginning to end, including the lyric sheet with the art by John Holmstrom. &quot;There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'/ Ya gotta keep it beatin' for all the hoppin' cretins/ Creeeeetin/ Creeeetin....&quot; Joey Ramone. RIP.
6300214826|5.0|The first time I watched this film it &quot;really put the hook in me&quot; Apocalypse Now is the benchmark I use for watching film. The movie made me want to read heart of darkness, the golden bough, and from ritual to romance, trying to understand mankind's decisions with power. Never under estimate the power of myth
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece, beautiful animation and compelling storyline. I'd recommend it to any anime fan or anyone who is interested in the Japanese culture. I feel that this film has been sadly overlooked because it's just dismissed as kid's stuff. I've heard complaints from parents about the film's violence, but that problem could have been solved by looking at the PG-13 label on the DVD. Even though the film comes close to 3 hours, that's the way Japanese story telling is. The reason why I recommended this to anyone interested in the Japanese culture is that they know that the Japanese like long drawn out stories and us Americans want the movie to get to the point. This movie also has a lot of symbolism so watch out for that. This movie was so moving that I actually cried at the end. This is a must-see...
1573226521|5.0|I have to say that I did watch the movie first and I that I do like the book better. Not because everything is \\"different\\" in the movie, but because Richard is much, much more likeable in the book. Having said that, I do think that some of the story is a bit contrived, however, it's not anything that makes you cringe.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This CD is, without a doubt, one of the greatest pieces of music to come out of the 20th century. Brian Wilson's knowledge of the studio has never been more beneficial, his musical vision never more stronger, his communication with the session musicians (his &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;), and with his lyricist Tony Asher never more open, his state of mind never more optimistic, and his confidence was unshakable, even winning over Mike Love, who not unreasonably had his doubts on some of the lyrics' pessimism.<br />This could be one of the first &quot;concept&quot; albums, dealing with the various stages of love relationships. And the instrumentation used to reflect the depth of human feelings (including empty water bottles and bicycle horns!) are very effective.<br />The most important instrument used was, of course, the group's vocals, never on better display as it is here. Brian's amazing knowledge of harmony structure, of which member's vocal should be used, when to use it (and just as important when NOT to use it) reenforces the fact of Brian's genius is not just an illusion. This of course applies to a number of Beach Boy songs and albums. <br />The one song that feels lyrically out of place is &quot;Sloop John B&quot; but it's such an incredible performance that this is nit-picking.<br />What's great about getting both the mono and stereo versions here is that you can compare the subtle differences of the vocals (and vocalists) used. This is explained in the 32 page booklet.<br />Of the bonus tracks included in the 1990 reissue, the only one to make it to this reissue is the &quot;guide&quot; vocal version of &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; later changed to &quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; to placate Mike Love.<br />A friend of mine bought me this album 25 years ago (yikes!) on my 12th birthday. It's been a part of my life ever since, and on this version you get the best of both worlds (mono and stereo) with the best sound quality you're likely to hear. There's no excuse now not to buy this beautiful CD.<br />Brian was inspired by The Beatles to make Pet Sounds. The Beatles were inspired by Pet Sounds to make Sgt. Pepper. What goes around comes around.<br />And Brian, if you're reading this (highly unlikely) I just want to thank you for opening up my 12 year old heart by baring your soul (and making me feel like a child every time I hear it)! You're the best.
B00004XQP4|3.0|Plain and simple.  It's just not the same. I'm a huge Green Day fan and I'm sad to say that they are becoming just like everyone else. Remember when Long View started being played on the radio and MTV? It broke the mold of pop music and was a relief to many who were fed up with the current music. But Warning does the oposite; it joins with everyone to create the same boring music. If you like stuff this is for you but before you buy this c.d. just remeber that this is not the same punk band that you might have been expecting.
6305205639|5.0|Man this was great.I'll have to agree it felt like I was at the concert LIVE.This video was second to none.The only MetallicA video that even comes near this good is S&amp;M.So if you are a die hard METALLICA FAN you MUST get this NOW it ROCKS!!!!!Oh as James said he would he sang as loud as a F...
B00003XACV|5.0|Thomas Newman's fantastic score accompany's a fantastic movie. I bought the Sountrack CD first (all that I really wanted was the theme &quot;Dead Already&quot;) and loved every second of it, so I had to go out and buy the score. Newman was cheated of the Oscar for this piece, for I have &quot;The Red Violin&quot; soundtrack and it is no where near as fantastic as this one. Newman's use of different instruments makes it all the more interesting, haunting, compleling and memorable. I only have one other soundtrack which I praise as much as this one, that being Hans Zimmer's GLADIATOR (Which again, was cheated out of oscar to CTHD). If you are a fan of AMERICAN BEAUTY and/or love Thomas Newman, run out to your nearest music store and pick up both the score and soundtrack to the outstanding moive.
B0000028RR|3.0|This is good as far as rap/rock goes. Zack's voice does get monotonous, and I don't really agree with their extreme left wing politics. The music is alright though. Check out Audioslave, the vocals on there are brilliant. Than again, it's Chris Cornell, so can you expect anything less?
B000002UJQ|4.0|all the hype surrounding &quot;ok computer&quot; is well deserved.  it's a damn good album, that may someday become an archetype for the perfect concept album.  there was so much effort and work put into the idea of anti-technology, anti-1984 beliefs that it's an admirable work on that basis alone.  the songs are some of the best radiohead has ever written, including the unparalleled opener &quot;airbag,&quot; with an ingenious mix of distorted guitars and syncopated, synthesized percussion.  if that's not impressive enough, it's followed by my personal favorite radiohead track (ever), &quot;paranoid android,&quot; a three-part journey into dissonance and (duh) paranoia.  other highlights include the trippy &quot;subterranean homesick alien,&quot; the hauntingly melodic &quot;let down,&quot; and &quot;exit music,&quot; a brooding slow acoustic number that eventually explodes into a totally fuzzed-out bass-filled black sabbath-like soundscape.  the feelings of paranoia and apprehension for cell-phones and laptop computers pervade the album's lyrics even in apparently random contexts (&quot;we hope that you choke&quot;, &quot;this is what you get when you mess with us&quot;, etc).  what hurts this album (ever so slightly) are the missteps on &quot;fitter happier,&quot; which is a little pretentious in its attempt to be radically different, though only a band of radiohead's caliber can pull it off without seeming that ridiculous, and &quot;electioneering&quot;, which isn't terrible, but it doesn't have a lasting impression and seems a little misplaced on this album.  overall though, this is quibbling over details, and the last few tracks certainly pick the pace back up, if in a more subdued tone, with a beautiful rendition of the lullaby-like &quot;no surprises&quot; and &quot;lucky&quot;.  &quot;ok computer&quot; is significantly more ambitious than &quot;pablo honey&quot; and less so compared to &quot;the bends&quot;; the songwriting makes this on par (more or less)with the previous record, though it isn't as personal or cohesive (it comes awfully close though in the latter case).  it's also easy to see (in retrospect at least) the electronic tendencies that creep up and eventually took over on &quot;kid a&quot;.  as anyone will admit, you can't call yourself a radiohead fan without this, but even if you're intrigued by the sounds of pink floyd and u2 (circa &quot;joshua tree&quot; and &quot;achtung baby&quot;) or have heard and liked &quot;paranoid android,&quot; this is a worthy addition to your cd case.

0451191153|4.0|The Fountainhead is a story of one man, Howard Roark - Ayn Rand's ideal man- and it is the story of how he fights the natural tendency of our world toward collectivism. Roark is a lone creator in a world of fakers, followers and phonies. <br />For those out there who follow a religious sect who believe in compassion and altruism as lofty goals - the atheistic objectivist credo of Ayn Rand may be hard to swallow. For me, it was not difficult at all. In fact, I had no difficulty at all reconciling Howard Roark with my religious beliefs. Simply, God and the highest ambitions and accomplishments of a creative individual, to me, are one and the same. Compassion and pity are not the loftiest Godly virtues in my world. I can reconcile compassion with objectivism. <br />In my religious world, individualism and achievement reign supreme. Compassion does exist but is secondary. Simply, the American experiment works so well because it has done a masterful job of balancing both fundamental needs of man: the need to create in an unfettered environment(liaises faire capitalism) and the need to believe in God. Ayn Rand's objectivism is a necessary antidote to our present condition to help restore the balance in a world where altruism is becoming the highest ideal. Although Ayn Rand is a proclaimed atheist, I do not think it is impossible to be both an objectivist and a believer. Man does not have to destroy the greatness in the individual to be God-like. One does not have to be a sociopath to be like Howard Roark. (One reviewer called Roark a sociopath and I totally disagree.) Roark has no use for most of the world and unlike the warped sociopath, he does not scheme to get his way - he merely works and achieves. The textbook sociopath feeds off the sickness of the world and achieves through cunning and deceit. Perhaps Wynand could be considered sociopathic, Toohey - definitely - but not Roark. His selfishness is the virtuous kind - directed toward creation. If one is religious - Roark is god-like and of course, blasphemous to the secular and non-secular priests - like Toohey - that are not willing to allow another god in their presence. (Toohey's god is power.)<br />In this novel, Ayn Rand describes her philosophy of objectivism through the interactions between characters. Peter Keating, an architect, achieves greatness by copying others. He is immoral and despite wealth and seeming success, his life is empty. He is the ultimate user and hypocrite. Keating is the immoral user that is the antithesis of the moral hero of the objectivist philosophy. <br />But Rand does not favor altruism as an answer to immoral deeds. In fact, altruism itself is evil because a society, which fosters it, always does so at someone else's expense, and that someone is, as in Roark's case, the true creator and ndividual. This warps and compromises the rightful way of things and inevitably leads us down the path to collectivism. In the person of Ellsworth Toohey, a sociopathic newspaper columnist, Ayn Rand shows how the power hungry manipulate the masses by setting a standard of mediocrity which fosters collectivism. Altruism is a favorite method of manipulation.<br />In our own time, over 50 years after the original publication of the Foutainhead, we can see how in the name of altruism, greedy and soulless politicians are still selling us an Altruistic nirvana. What started as an altruistic call to help the underclass and the oppressed, Affirmative Action and other programs of its like have become programs of evil. Though well intentioned, Affirmative Action programs allow the mediocre to take the place of the best and the brightest in our schools and other institutions. And the sickness is not merely that it advances the stupid and slow among us. There are some very bright but terribly misguided people who think that Affirmative Action is a good thing. Out of guilt and the need to conform, many intelligent people have been led astray as well. And for the people ofcolor who think it is a good thing - it is nothing more than the face of slavery in a new costume.<br />So, in the end, Roark's passion for his work and uncompromising creativity in accomplishing his professional goals set him apart from the second-handers - the same one's that feed off the creativity of the greats thinkers of history: the Galileos, the Edisons, and yes, even our modern Prometheus - the Edward Tellers of the world! <br />Roark is a hero because he will never compromise despite enormous pressures to do so. Although many argue about the necessity to compromise depending upon circumstance, compromising to misplaced altruism or the forces of evil leads to immorality, or fascism, or downright stupidity. Does anyone really want to be operated on by an Affirmative Action brain surgeon?<br />Roark did not sell out. He is certainly a valuable model in this world of immoral leaders and corrupted politicians willing to sacrifice even the greatest among us for their collectivist agendas.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|Gone in sixty seconds disappointed me to some extent but I can't say that it was awful..<br />I hadn't seen the original &quot;cult&quot; movie dated 1974,but I had heard a lot of good things about it..The cast for the new version was great and I was especially happy that Nicolas Cage,one of my favorite actors,was playing Memphis Raines,the lead character.The listed cars to be stolen by our thieves were real beauties and they alone were a sufficient reason for me to like the movie..Well,at the end,it turned out to be the case,as they were one of the few good things about the movie..<br />Here is the simple plot..The young brother of the legendary car boost Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines and his crew make a deal with a mobster and agree to steal some cars for him..Things don't go right and they mess it up..The mobster,an italian nicknamed &quot;The Carpenter&quot;,holds young Kip Raines hostage in order to convince big brother Memphis Raines to do the job..Memphis,who had quit the city and &quot;boosting&quot; cars some years ago,reluctantly agrees and gets his crew back together in order to steal 50 rare and expensive cars in 3 nights...<br />The movie could have been good if only the script was a bit heavier and the characters were better developed.My guess is that Bruckheimer,the producer of the movie and the big audience entertainer,decided it would slow the movie down.But I should also note that altough the final big chase was quite entertaining (somehow I have the feeling the big chase in the original film was better),that's almost the only car chase in a movie you expect to include a lot of.I was under the impression that from the moment Memphis agrees to do the job,all the script did was to prepare us for the big final show.<br />The actors did a pretty job altough I don't think they had to spend too much effort for those &quot;weak&quot; characters they played.Nicolas Cage was fun to watch and Angelina Jolie was strange looking in blonde hair.But my favorite actor was Giovanni Ribisi in this movie.(Kip)<br />The DVD includes a nice amount of extras and the picture and sound quality are great..<br />I give this 3 stars because of Nicolas Cage and some nice scenes here and there..If you are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat or a movie with surprises,you probably won't like this one..If you are looking for lots of car chases,again you may be disappointed.If you are just looking for having a nice time and have a wild ride,then I suggest you to try Gone in 60 seconds..rite actor was Giovanni Ribisi in this movie.(Kip)<br />The DVD includes a nice amount of extras and the picture and sound quality are great..<br />I give this 3 stars because of Nicolas Cage and some nice scenes here and there..If you are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat or a movie with surprises,you probably won't like this one..If you are looking for lots of car chases,again you may be disappointed.If you are just looking for having a nice time and have a wild ride,then I suggest you to try Gone in 60 seconds..
B0000042FP|5.0|I have always been highly skeptical of the fanatic devotion that some fans have to some singers. I hear the fans go on at hysterical pitch and wonder what all the fuss is about, or why they get so worked up over an opera singer.<br />However, Tebaldi is one singer whose following I understand. Her recording of La Wally knocks me out, and her Fanciulla del West sends me into orbit; but this Forza has left me gasping for breath. Listen to &quot;Madre, pietosa Virgine&quot; and you'll know what hysterical devotion feels like. This is one voice that could make an atheist believe in God: the gorgeous tone and seamless legato as she sweeps up these famous phrases is something purely angelic.    Take Tebaldi at her absolute peak, del Monaco in a role that requires his kind of power and not the refinement he usually lacks, Siepi who had one of the most gorgeous bass voices ever heard anywhere and you have a full recording that the world cries out for (as opposed to another uninspired Boheme).
B0000524E5|4.0|This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly.  The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.   <br />Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar.  The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow.  They do not take away from the story, but hold it together.  Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make.  There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching.
B000059MEK|5.0|I never succeeded in listening to Homework from start to finish despite some pure gems interspersed in it. Discovery, despite their humorous attempt at self-destruction by choosing One more time as a single, is a wonder from track 2 and keeps growing on you after each new listening. <br />Highly addictive and perverse stuff. It takes some times to accustom to your ear to their new work but once you're in it, it's over and this CD is squatting my Hi-Fi. There is no warning. I was trapped as soon as my 2nd listening.<br />I suspect that they're so comfortable with so many styles they could come into Air territory and dwarf them.<br />Open your mind and enjoy the MUSIC ; it's one of the best released in the recent years.<br />Disregard the media over-exposure, the journalistic hype and the fact that this album doesn't fit in any music &quot;box&quot;, give DISCOVERY a chance or two and DISCOVER this album is the most innovative and moving in electronica since a long, long time.<br />This album has much to offer but no exactly where you'd expect it to be.<br />PS : Still can't bear One more time despite the cartoon clip.
B00003CXE7|4.0|To my detrement I did not see this on the big screen where I think it must have looked spectacular! The gladiatorial combats are a treat. I think that this must be one of the best representations of what it must have felt like to be a gladiator at the Colloseum. It had a profound effect on me and I was thinking about it for ages afterwards. In the scene where the gladiators are waiting to enter the ring, you can really feel the fear of these poor souls. It is comparable to the first scene of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; where you really get inside the fear of the soldierd aboard the landing craft. But, even though there is some gore, it is not as &quot;in your face&quot; as in &quot;Ryan&quot;. I do have some complaints about it though. In one scene Maximus is in germany and in the next he is in Spain, having evaded capture and having ridden the same horse all that way! Also in the last fight scene, why should the general (I forget his name) suddenly tell his men to sheath their swords and let Comodus die, after all, he has betrayed Maximus throughout by not supporting him. it doesn't ring at all true. Also, I was sorry to see that Hollywoods original departure from history is stil the norm for gladiator films. The thumbs up/down thing to indicate whether you want a downed gladiator to live or die is actually THE OPPOSITE WAY ROUND! Thumbs down means SHEATH your sword. That is where the 4 stars comes in. It is interesting, though, that they used Derek Jakobi, star of the 70's multi part I Claudius. Maybe it was somewhat of a tribute to him. Also, most of the actors are English, which makes sense because, on the whole, English actors really ARE actors.   Some great filming though, and Ridley Scott's obsession with darkness and varying shades of orange is ever apparant. Worth seeing.
6303187064|5.0|the crow is a movie that you either love or you hate.most people who see it, like me, love it.its mix of chilling stories, amazing fight sequences, and a gothic over-look made the crow a movie that can really capture the tastes of everyone of all ages.every actor or actress who performed gave a 5-star performance.the only flaw the movie had was the fact that a great actor got his life taken away by a stupid little accident of putting real bullets in a gun instead of blanks.so if your into gothic type of movies, fighting movies, and or horror movies, i strongly suggest this brilliant cinematic masterpiece.
0871137380|5.0|I cant say enough good stuff about this book. At first I wasnt sure if i wanted to buy it, but after i talked to a few people and it was brought up, (Somalia), they said they also had some doubts at first but went ahead and actually liked it. Being a medic in the Army, I felt I should also give it a shot and I also liked it so, yeah, its a good book and you should buy it.
B000002U9Y|4.0|Overall this is a pretty high quality Floyd album.  All of the songs are fairly good with the exception of the 11 minute title track that lacks spark or anything special, otherwise this would be just below Dark Side and the Wall.  The album starts of with a great opening base on Let there be more light then turns into a longer Barretesque type song with the cosmic lyrics.  The two songs that Rick Wright wrote are both tremendous, See-Saw and Remember a Day which are both possibly remincient of his childhood and display many of the paranoia and schizophrenic elements of their prime.  Set the controls is along the same side as let there be more light, both are quite good.  Corporal Clegg is a pretty good song with a nice beat to it and I do like the voices in the background but the kazoos killed it.   Finally, the Barret song Jugband Blues is, to me, a bitter song about his departure from the band &quot;I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here.&quot;  Overall this is a good Floyd album not for the beginning listener, first go and pick up their 70's stuff.
055347359X|5.0|I love unique books, and this one is marvelous!  Although it is classified as juvenile fiction, I recommend it to young and old, male or female - it is such an imaginative story that gets you to think about life as we know it.  I couldn't help thinking of Prozac while listening to this book, and how this and other drugs may be used to mask &quot;feelings&quot; and thus mask life, and make everything kind of vanilla.  It's one of those books you want to walk around recommending to everyone you talk to, just so you have more people to talk to about it!
B00004XONN|5.0|Well, I for one love this CD.  I think it's a classic.  Some people hate it and there are also some people in between.  I'm not going to try to join the debate and repeat what everyone else has said.  I'm not going to tell you what you'll think of it, or that you should or shouldn't like it.  Who am I to say that? <br /><br /> Maybe you will erect a shrine to Kid A in your living room, or maybe you will want to smash the CD with a sledgehammer.  But this is one case where you should definitely take that risk.  Kid A has made such an impact that you should be able to have an opinion about it, one way or the other; otherwise you're really missing out.  Even if I didn't like it, I'd still recommend you check it out, just to find out for yourself.  I wouldn't say this about every CD.  But Kid A is, if nothing else, extremely &quot;important&quot;, much as I hate to use that term.  <br /><br /> If you hate it, at least it will make a good Christmas gift for someone you don't like.  Or, if you've already smashed it with the sledgehammer, use the pieces as glittery decorations for arts and crafts.  Whatever.  Just give it a try.<br /><br /> now, where's that new album? just 42 days to go till Amnesiac...42 days...42 days...
0780631684|3.0|\\"Final destination\\" starts out very fine indeed! From the ominous title-sequence, accompanied by Shirley Walkers effective score, until the inventive first murder, the atmosphere is thick with foreboding and threatening omens. And the airplane accident must surely be the most terrifying ever to be put onto celluloid! Scary stuff, to be sure!!! However, the movie goes downhill from there. The murders become more and more unconvincingly contrived (the bus-accident is a very well handled shock, though) and characters, grown-ups as well as adolescents, behave increasingly silly. Anyway, it's well above average for this kind of horror-thriller even if the final isn't as surprising as the filmmakers probably intended. Competent all the way with an unusual premise to begin with and, above all, a very nice surprise from a genre that seemed to have outlived itself after all the latest Screamclones.
B000002AT6|5.0|This is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. It may seem strange, but some of the tracks actually sound like Montana. My favorite track is &quot;The Ludlows&quot; becase the violin is breathtaking. I give this soundtrack ten fingers up!
B00000JGEN|5.0|I often rewatch my favorite Arnold action flicks.  This one's a classic!  Of course the premise is ridiculous: in the near future, the most entertaining television show will feature supposedly convicted criminals being pursued and slain by enormously muscled, outlandishly costumed, ludicrously personae'ed &quot;Stalkers&quot;.  Implausible... or is it?  Rewatching just the other day, I suddenly realized how eerily accurately this 1987 film seems to have spoofed the phenomenal evolution and popularity of the World Wrestling Federation!  Not so coincidentally, the film's Stalkers are played by 'roided-out pro-wrestlers of its day, including Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura.  The obnoxious, smarmy gameshow host is a forerunner (or futuristic clone?) of WWF honcho Vince McMahon.  There are even scantily-clad bimbos, the titillation equivalent of Wrestling's &quot;Ho Train&quot;.  (None of the &quot;Running Man&quot; dancers have silicon implants; an aesthetic omission the WWF would never be guilty of!)  There's no chainsaw murder on &quot;Raw is War&quot; -- yet -- although come to think of it, a few Stalkers might actually improve those inane &quot;survivor&quot; shows.  OK, maybe not.  But at least Arnold &quot;The Running Man&quot; never takes himself so seriously as those deadpan contestants of WWF and &quot;Survivors&quot;.  There's plenty of grisly humor.  Each of the Stalkers meets an appropriately karmic demise, punctuated by one of Arnold's trademark one-liner quips.  But the best line of the film comes from Dweezil, son of the late, great Frank Zappa.  That's right folks -- &quot;Don't touch that dial!&quot;
0694524786|5.0|HarperAudio has produced a exciting, unabridged, audio recording of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,&quot; featuring the well-known British actor, Michael York, (who played John the Baptist in Zefirrelli's outstanding film &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;).<br />Our family recently listened to the CD recordings while on a car trip. York brings each character to life with his vocal inflections, his use of dynamics (loud and soft voicings) and best of all, his mastery of various accents--British, Irish and Scottish--given to the different characters. Here each &quot;person&quot; has a vivid personality, and the listener can easily picture them in his or her mind.<br />We've enjoyed the Focus on the Family dramatization, as well as the BBC version, in the past, but I'd prefer to hear the unabridged text of this C.S. Lewis classic fantasy, with its spiritual and allegorical undertones. We've read this story aloud several times in our family over the years, but I believe that, from now on, we'll let Michael York read it to us. This is a pure delight (not like the &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; that Edmund ate)!
B0000019PA|5.0|In The Aeroplane Over The Sea is a concept album of sorts, centered around mythological characters, confused yet magical existenstialism, mysterious sounds from above, musical eclecticism from the wonders of yesteryear (marching bands, singing saws, bagpipes, etc.) and today (folk guitars, electric rock), free-spirited religious ponderings, and endless imagination. It's the equivalent of a children's fantasy book, but adulterated enough to avoid being ignorant pap. It mixes the world of today, the world of yesterday, and the supernatural world into a psychadelic psyche fest worthy of a melancholy series of dreams set in a vaudevillian wonderland. Mangum may not be as prolific as the great Robert Pollard (a.k.a. Guided By Voices), but the two are on the same serendipity-drenched wavelength. Hopefully, On Avery Island is as beautiful as this.
B00003CXMG|1.0|I purchased the almost famous dvd because I am a fan of Fairuza Balk and she is listed in the cast, she is completely cut from this dvd and to me this is false advertising
B00003CXPD|5.0|I haven't seen a movie as uplifting and inspiring as Billy Elliot in years.  Totally overlooked at the Academy Awards, this movie definately should have taken home some hardware.  Hope this young actor continues to produce such great movies.
6300216268|1.0|I saw this movie in 1971 and to this day I consider it to be the worst film I have ever seen. I consider myself to have eclectic tastes; I watch all kinds of movies made from all over the world. But I have to say that the memory of &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; still makes me cringe after 30 years. It has a following that is obviously very passionate about it and I risk my Amazon rating by giving it a bad review. Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort's characters are extremely annoying. And I'm sorry, but the idea of a 20 year old and an 80 year old being romantically involved is, how shall we say, contra naturum. Taste is personal, but as C.S. Lewis asked in the &quot;Abolition of Man&quot;, if a waterfall is sublime to one observer and mundane to another, which is it in reality? Can it be both sublime and mundane?  In the case of &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, the answer is a resounding 'no'. It is a most mundane effort.
0446677450|4.0|I purchased this book with no real expctations of what I wanted to get out of it.  While I did not find any recommendations for &quot;get rich quick&quot; schemes, this book did help me develop a better philosophy about money, investing, and life in general.  After reading this book, I now have a better appreciation for life-time learning, what the pros/cons are of considering more &quot;risky&quot; investments, and what the benefits are of building your assets so you can get out of the &quot;rat race&quot; and into the &quot;fast track.&quot;
6300182355|5.0|This movie is great! Im a fair fan of sci-fi and this movie is throghly enjoyable. The effects and costumes are CHEESY but I did not mind. I kind of liked the cheesy effects. I don't know if the movie would have had the same affect on me if it had good effects. Classics hero movie.
0553106635|5.0|Did you ever sit around the campfire as a child and have someone tell you a story so good that you didn't want them to stop but demanded a conclusion as well....this series is that story.

(Otherwise I'd have to demand a s&eacute;ance!!)

B00003CX8I|4.0|In attempting to rate a movie, I ask myself 1 simple question - would I pay to see it again?  In the case of X-Men, yes.<br />Had this movie not already been so thoroughly reviewed, I would have provided a synopsis.  That not being the case, I will simply add my two cents (and rating) to the average.<br />Short and sweet - if you like the comic (or cartoon), you'll love the movie.  Don't expect a deep plot or award winning performaces.  If that's what you're after - look elsewhere.  If you're looking for pure and simple entertainment, without the cerebral factor, you've found it.  My only complaint would be it wasn't long enough and there were too few characters.  But hey, that's what sequels are for right ;-)
B0000508U6|4.0|I must admit, it's not often that I'll buy a CD before I've heard at least 3 songs on the radio, but with Coldplay, something made me take a chance...  I was intrigued by &quot;Yellow&quot; and decided to risk buying the whole CD rather than the single, and I was pleasantly surprised by the music.<br />Some of my favorites are: Trouble, High Speed, Sparks, and Everything's Not Lost.  The guitar in these songs is often very lilting and relaxing, although there are places where the guitar is a bit edgier.  I consider Coldplay's Parachutes an unexpected treasure and a great introduction--they've many more albums than this one, but &quot;Yellow&quot; has made them a name here in the States.<br />I can't/don't see a similarity between their music and Radiohead.  True, Radiohead's music is pretty introspective, but it's a harder sound.  Coldplay's sound is best described as dreamy and ethereal (at least on this album).  I really identify with the song &quot;Trouble&quot;--the whole song is an apology for hurting someone because circumstances have made things that complicated.  It's a simple concept, but with the music and the wording, the actual regret comes right through your speakers.<br />I enjoyed this CD so much, I plan on trying out their past music!
B000000WA4|5.0|After five years listening, this is still my favourite album ever and the best album Pumpkins have ever made. It is actually a little miracle of rock. You can listen it anytime and in any mood. It might tell something about this album's absolute greatness, that I started to play guitar because of it. I personally think that every teen should buy this album, it won't get much better than this. Buy it. Now. It is really something that's worth it's price.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Please!  Dido doesn't sound anything like that booooring Sarah McLachlan!  Nor Sinead.  Nor does she write like Alanis. She sounds like Dido.  She writes like Dido.  This is the best new (first) cd I've heard in ages.  Dido successfully combines synthesizers with acoustic guitar, flute/pennywhistle, piano and, sometimes, even harmonica.  Though the cd could be said to be thematic, the songs and lyrics and tempo all vary.  She is a very versatile young lady, and if this is her first effort,  LOOK OUT!  She's gonna be great.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Limp Bizkit had done a great job on this album especially with songs like nookie, breakstuff, and rearranged.  The songs beat varies so that your not listening to the same beat all the time.  I reccomend this CD if you want a good album with songs where you can just play the whole album without having to skip over any bad tracks.
0553284347|5.0|This book was very inciteful since my wonderful husband was literally destroying  himself with overeating as a result of my mother-in-law. My mother-in-law is a very controlling, domineering, manipulative person who would rather see her son my husband alone and 400 pounds than happy with me and our sons because when he was alone he paid most of his attention to her but was unhappy and unloved. My mother-in-law loves my husband so long as he does everything her way and would do anything in the way of manipulating him to get me away from him but thanks in part to the book and great comunication he refuses to by into it anymore and basically cut himself off from her and is much healthier as a result he has recently had a gastric bypass to lose weight and lost over 60 lbs in a month and a half and is on his way to being whole again. Thank you for writing a book that had to be written and helping people like my husband deal with destructive parents!!!!!
B00003CXPD|1.0|I recently purchased &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; on DVD because it had great reviews, and somehow it had missed showing at all of our local theaters.  Once I saw the movie I realized why it never made to our local theaters.  The movie isn't anything special.  The cinematography could have been much better, especially the audio (I found myself having to adjust the volume constantly) as one scene is extremely quiet while the next is extremely loud (very annoying).  The story was very predictable.  All in all, a very disappointing purchase.
0441172717|3.0|This book was ok! if you like fantasy fiction then you will probably like this book, and better yet after you read it you can watch the movie and see everything that happens or you can watch the movie and read the book . whatever that you choose it is your choice but i think you should read dune it is  very good book.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|&quot;oh la la&quot; is the name of the song and it's a good one, although &quot;glad and sorry&quot; is even better! both written and sung by ronnie lane! that's right! rod stewart and ron wood waz in the band but ronnie was the heart and soul. buy &quot;rough mix&quot; also,it features ronnie with some guy named pete townsend who tries to write songs as good as ronnie, but guess what, it's a tie. HA.
0451160916|4.0|This is, as incredible as it sounds, the first Stephen King book I've ever read. I would like to start by saying that it is indeed scary, and an enjoyable read. Reading this book for a prestigious literary course, I had to put all stereotypes aside, that a thriller can't be worthy of literary praise, that a cover the screams #1 bestseller isn't going to have any literary worth when I read the book, as my teacher assured us that Stephen King does know a think or two about literary conventions. Theme, worldviews, and characterization-it's all in there. <br />In fact this novel is written in the five-act Shakespearian structure; exposition, inciting incident, rising action, crisis moment, and falling action/ resolution. In a thriller book, this is the only logical way to present the thrill. However, I admit that I felt the book should've been shorter, mostly because I felt like I knew the ending from the beginning (and I've never seen the movie). The prose seemed simple; so simple sometimes I felt almost as though King wasn't granting any credit to the readers. <br />The overall thematic intent of the book seemed muffled. At first I thought it was somewhat of a ghost story, but then it seemed as if the alcoholism that Jack suffered from took over with the dramatics, then back to the ghosts of the Overlook hotel. All the while both, not to mention the psychic encounters his son Danny faces or a talent King calls \\"shine\\", are destroying the family. In the beginning there is a definite distinction between the Torrence family competing against the Overlook hotel, which are equally corrupt. Then Jack is removed from the family because the hotel spirit has defeated him personally because he was the easiest target, corrupt past, drinking problem, bad tempter etc.  These issues were explained in the beginning exposition, or act one, so it seemed to spoil a potential suspense for later in the novel.  So then with Jack under the control of the hotel evil, it is obvious that Wendy and Danny aren't equally capable of defeating this opposition on their own. Very predictably, a character reappears to save the day. <br />One very important dramatic decision King made was establishing a past for the rivals. This is where the theme of history repeating itself is introduced. Knowing that it is cyclical in nature the reader waits to see if either opposing force can defeat it's own history. The lesson to be learned here is that if you aren't informed, history will repeat itself; hence the \\"overlook\\" name. Those who violate those laws of nature are punished in the end. Luckily, so the ending being in agreement with every reader's expectations saves the overall worldview. <br />Another disappointment for me was the falling action. As I said, I felt I knew what was going to happen so perhaps it took away from the suspense. The material was well put together in the beginning, very scary, and well positioned. However it seemed that in the progression of the five acts, the end fizzled, it didn't explode. And with a book of that potential all through the beginning and middle parts, it needs to go out with a bang!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Any film that can make me cry is one I will always remember. An animated film that can make me cry is one I will never forget. Breathtaking.
B000002N2Z|5.0|this is an awesome CD. every single song is a nonstop screamfest. chino belts out some of the best lyrics i've heard since rage's first album. engine no.9 is my personal favorite, but 7 words, one weak, bored, minus blindfold, and nosebleed are also excellent examples of what the deftonnes are made of. rock on deftones.
0553573403|5.0|I had stopped reading Fantasy book for some time because I found them to be formulaic and simple to the point of being childish.  A friend of mine insisted that I read this to the point of buying it for me.  I'm glad he did.  This is complex, unpredictable and completely captivating.  Don't look for everything to be tied up in a nice neat package and don't get too attached to any character.  Martin does not shy away from adult themes or actions and the story is better for it.
6305892806|1.0|This movie is awful.  I was so disappointed to see that the novel was not followed closely.  The director actually had the audacity to try to improve on Jane Austen, which just cannot be done.  The story line has been twisted, the costumes and hairstyles are mediocre at best (especially Edward's!), and the graphic sexual scene is completely uncalled for and inappropriate.  Jane Austens novels have a pervading modesty and the director just ignored that.  Also, the business about slavery was totally out of place.  Use your money on something else -- like the BBC's joint effort with A&E of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", which is a truly wonderful film adaption of an Austen Novel.
0792151712|2.0|Best picture, best original song, all that....<br />All right- I hated the movie.  The special effects were incredible, but the rest was dumb.  Reason: too predictable.<br />Now, I don't mean, &quot;Oh, the ship is going to sink.  It is too predictable.&quot;<br />What I mean is, I saw the movie and could, at every single scene, predict what was going to happen in the next three scenes.  And, I was right all along!  It was like every other romance movie.  It doesn't deserve those awards it got.  It was just another pointless movie.<br />One other thing I hate about it: &quot;My Heart Will Go On.&quot;  The song was the same as every one of Celine Dion's other songs, so it should have stayed on the CD.
0060174900|4.0|This is a great book.  It neatly shows how those with psychiatric problems may look normal on the outside but inside they are rotting (and I think I am entitled to use the word rotting).  Plath's work clearly demonstrates how even the most promising are in reality just a few steps away from personal hells.  The descriptions of electro-convulsive therapy are terrifying (although the process has suppousedly been made less barbaric today).  It would be interesting to read this book if it had been written today when psychotropic drugs are somewhat more effective.
0671646788|5.0|David Schwartz's classic success book &quot;The Magic of Thinking Big&quot; is one of the top ten all time best proactive success books.  After you have read it you will begin to refer to the earlier part of your life as &quot;before I read the book.&quot;  Even before you finish reading it the first time, you will be a changed person - it's that incredible.  I say first time because you will want to read it again and again.  My copy is well read, well read, and well marked.  It has been a treasured part of my library and I've recommended it to others countless times.<br />I consider David Schwartz to be one of the earliest &quot;proactive thinkers&quot; in the world.  If you haven't read this book before, get ready for profound wisdom.  Schwartz makes it easy to understand that our thoughts are things and have God given powers, far beyond what is commonly taught by others.  I can tell you from my own astonishing situations and experiences that, &quot;your success really is most definitely determined by what and how you think.&quot;<br />Schwartz covers all of the proactive bases: smart thinking, system thinking, futuristic thinking, and positive thinking.  If you are truly seeking the kind of success and abundance that makes your life 100% livable - you must read this book.  Many of his ideas are found in SUCCESS BOUND, another book built on learning how to live a proactively life that is God centered and fulfilling.<br />You will find that this exciting book becomes a part of you.  Don't hold back - let it happen.  In fact, you should spend 10 to 15 minutes every morning focusing your thoughts on the truths of this book, thereby allowing them to seep deep into your subconscious mind.  If you do this I guarantee this wisdom will most assuredly bring you the success and abundance you deserve.<br />Enjoy the book and your new proactive success life!
0767824571|2.0|THG is classic Python with laughs a minute and insightful satire a-plenty.  That said, let me emphasize that the low rating I give this DVD has nothing to do with the film itself.<br />However, how the marketers can get by calling this a &quot;Deluxe&quot; anything is beyond me.  Not only are there no extras (forgivable), the quality of the transfer is atrocious.  Sure, it looks better than my VHS copy, and for that I'm grateful.  But there was no attempt made to clean up simply things like dust and fiber from the print.  In addition the sound is mastered at a volume that is too low to do much with.  Any other disc I watch, my system rattles the room.  With this disc, the volume was up to 11, and a room of 5 people had trouble hearing the shouting.<br />Very disappointing.
B000000WHX|5.0|Released in 1990, BLUE LINES was the first LP by Massive Attack, a trio from Bristol that had colloborated together before, with others, as the Wild Bunch. The nine tracks of BLUE LINES hit contemporary music in the gut, creating a new style that was more melodic than hip-hop but still retaining a beat. Combining the soulful singing of Shara Nelson, the rapping of Grant Marshall and Robert Del Naja, and the reggae crooning of Horace Andy, this album was something new and exciting.<br />More than ten years later, it's still an surprisingly fresh album. &quot;Safe From Harm&quot; deserves radio play still. The dialogue rapping &quot;Daydreaming&quot; continually amazes me. &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; has retained its excitement, and DJs like Sasha still spin it.<br />Massive Attack's first album, and just as good as the two since released.
0380796090|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but alas I came away rather disappointed.  I just did not find it as laugh out loud funny as many of the reviewers.  The writing is weak, the plot predictable and the characters rather shallow.  I am a huge fan of British humor, but I would advise readers to give this one a pass.
0385470819|5.0|In my opinion, A Time To Kill is the best book John Grisham has written to date.  A Time To Kill is a modern day novel dealing with an issue the United States has been dealing with since being a colony; the issue of black versus white.  A time To Kill is a modern day Uncle Tom's Cabin or, better yet, To Kill A Mockingbird.      The story takes place in Ford County, Mississippi, in a small rural town called Claton.  The Ku Klux Klan is alive and real in this small community.  A ten-year-old black girl is beaten and raped by two members of the clan, Billy Ray Cobb and Pete Willard.  Cobb and Willard throw the girl in Foggy Creek to die, but because of a strong will to live the girl makes it to the road and is found.      Her father, Carl Lee Hailey, buys a gun and hides in the courthouse waiting for Cobb and Willard to go before the Grand Jury.  He steps out of his hiding place and takes the law into his hands, killing the two rapists.      Jake Brigance is a young lawyer whom Carl Lee appoints as his attorney.  His defense team includes himself, a graduate student, Ellen Roark, and an investigator, Harry Rex.  This team takes on racial prejudice, the Klan, the NAACP, and the community as they defend a black man accused of killing two white men.      Chapter to chapter, page to page, A Time To Kill is filled with action.  This book will make Americans look at their prejudices and how they affect all our lives.
B00005ATZT|4.0|This is not Harrison Ford'd best film it it still is excellent.  Harison plays Dr Kimble who is being framed for killing his wife.  Dr Kimble who is high in society has to avoid being caught in order to prove his inocence.  This film is action packed with the main part being the spectacular crash scene involving a bus and a train, which is one of the best crash scenes that i have ever seen in a movie.  This is a must have film, which i have on video but will be replacing on dvd as soon as it is released
B000059TPN|5.0|Only Bad Boys comes close to this action extravaganza about a group of marines who take hostages on Alcatraz and threaten the San Francisco Bay Area with poison gas rockets.  Sean Connery, Nick Cage and Ed Harris are in fine form supported by a great ensemble of actors, including the always excellent David Morse.  This is Michael Bay's best.  It has a good story (never mind some of the plot holes this is a movie!), tons of action and great shots that make it look very slick.<br />The DVD presented by those generous folks at Criterion is pretty good.  The video transfer is exceptionally good with only a few artefacts here and there.  The sound comes in DTS and Dolby Digital and both are loud and make full use of the surrounds. The score by Hans Zimmer just roars into action.<br />The special features are extensive with a commentary and several interesting documentaries.  It is a pretty extensive (not more so than Armageddon) 2 disc set with a very interesting commentary on disc 1.  The Hollywood Gunplay feature is one of the more interesting ones that deserve a mention<br />This movie with a running time over 2 hours goes by at a blistering pace.  I highly recommend the Criterion Collection set of The Rock.
B00004THAY|4.0|How could this go wrong? A great CD displaying two guitar legends, their mutual respect for each other shows clearly, they never get in each others way. New songs and old songs, all of them very well performed. The sound quality could have been better though, especially the extreme panning is annoying, Clapton far left and BB King far right. Still, a must have for anyone who likes Clapton and/or BB King!
0804106304|4.0|This book was incredible.  From the moment I picked it up I couldn't put it down.  I had to find out what happened to the various people next.  Mrs. Dumke, if you ask me to say their names, I'm just informing you, it's not going to happen.  There is no way I could pronounce those names correctly.  Anyway, for all of you out there that haven't read this book and are considering it, read it.  It's one of the best books I've ever read, and there aren't many that I truly love.
6304493681|5.0|This is it, one of the best science fiction Anime films that was ever made.  Following a plot line and carrying a message similar to that of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, Ghost in the Shell features good script, plot, art, and cultural cross over experience.
B000002GYG|5.0|While I couldn't pin down my overall favorite Tom Waits album, I can point to &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot; as my favorite work of Waits in regards to lyrics. Tom Waits gives prose a saucy depth that is all his own, and this album is the piece that brings that prose out in its greatest glory! This is a unique live album since the audience is a small gathering, so the cheers and chuckles sound like Waits is entertaining several dozen people at a party. This initimate setting works well since he does unforgettable spoken introductions for a number of his songs which are almost as poetic as the songs (IE &quot; I was reaching the end of an emotional cul-de-sac&quot;). My personal favorite tunes on this CD (for both lyric and song) are &quot;Putnam County&quot; (spoken to music; describing the lazy social going-ons in a tiny blue collar American town) and &quot;Spare Parts&quot; (awesome upbeat tune describing dawn in a seedy urban setting: &quot;The stew bums showed up like bounced checks/rubbing their necks, and the sky turned the color of Pepto Bismol/ and the parking lots growled&quot;) This CD is not just a great Tom Waits CD; this is a great CD for anybody's collection!
B00004XMV6|3.0|When I first saw this movie I was torn between the opinion that it was either very good or really not.  Much like Last Tando in Paris, a film of similar pretense, 9 1/2 Weeks will either hit or miss with it's audience on an individual basis.  One way or another this is a powerfully erotic movie and when it is over it will leave you thinking.<br />Elizabeth(Kim Basinger) works in an art studio and apparently has not had much luck with men since her marriage broke up.  One day while in a store with her friend she runs into John(Mickey Rourke).  There connection is instant, although neither of them acts on the initial impulse.  Later in a open market John sees Elizabeth and proceeds to sweep her off her feet.  There relationship gains momentum quickly.  John takes control of Elizabeth, particularly, in the physical part of the affair.  He makes her do things she has never done before, and despite being timid at times, she seems powerless to his demands.  As John and Elizabeth get more involved they eventually fall in love.  <br />The film ends rather unexpectedly.  Despite some weak subplots this remains a strong film.  What makes it so strong is the electric chemistry between Rourke and Basinger.  They make the film quite watchable.  The direction by Adrian Lyne is exactly what it should be.  It's dark mood sets the stage perfectly for these two accomplished actors.<br />I do not believe this film is for everyone, but it is a good movie.  I would recommend viewing it if you are in the mood for a character study or a break from the mainstream.  Some people will decide, as I have, that this movie was worth watching, but others will feel they just wasted their time.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Wow.  What a phenomenal CD.  I saw this in Florence with Mehta conducting, and was completely blown away.  This recording is just about the only one I've heard (although I've only heard three *griN*) that really does justice to Puccini's masterful opera.  Although he didn't compose the final part of the opera (he died before it was completed), it still stands as an amazing piece of work.  My knowledge of opera is very close to nothing, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  Of course, if you are a casual listener like me, then maybe my review will be of some value after all.  So anyway, Turandot is characterized by its monumental brass fanfares, carefully balanced by its soft, lyrical melodies.  Parts of the opera are almost jarring in their fierce harshness, but not overwhelmingly so.  Sutherland and Pavarotti both sound wonderful (again, note that this is to my non-classically trained ear).  The soft savagery of this opera and this recording in particular make it an indispensable CD.  I lost my original copy, and was completely elated when my girlfriend bought me a replacement for my birthday.  I have no doubt you'll be similarly pleased :)
B000050XEI|5.0|Yes 5 years is a long time, but good effort takes time. This is clearly real adult fun. The music is best enjoyed while sipping a white wine and staring into a medow. Many of us live tense lives and Enya helps take the edge off. My only question is this: If you went to an Enya concert wouldn't it spoil the mood to applaud?
0684853523|5.0|First, I have to admit that I have never read a Stephen King novel.  Ever.  But I know that everyone else on the face of the earth has read his books.  As a writer who struggles for ever word, I wanted to find out what Stephen King had to say about writing.  It turns out King has some wonderful ideas for finding just the right word as well as great ideas for finding stories.  His life story is fascinating and the step-by-step writing help is invaluable.  I couldn't put this book down and I bought a copy to keep.  In the autobiographical section, King tells us how everyday experiences sometimes give him story ideas.  For example, at one point Mr. King slips in a restroom... and he uses the experience as the basis of a very imaginative story.  This book is highly recommended by me.
B000002GYR|5.0|I was first introduced to Tom Waits' music, as this grouchy singing bluesman, with a witty twist of words. But after I heard &quot;Closing Time&quot;. I realized he had another hidden side to him. And you know what..it blew me away! In contrary to his successive albums in which he imposes a dirty smirk on your face or even haunts you with his theatrical expressions, here you'll get to lie down in a darkened room totally surrendering to your inner vulnerablities. And at the end of the record, you'll wonder how did this guy get to you so effortlessly?! Enjoy.
0345404475|4.0|&quot;Blade Runner&quot; is and had been for many years one of my favorite sci-fi movies.  I'll take its film noir-ish depiction of the future over Star Wars's cartoonish-ness any time.  And after all these years, I finally got around to reading the source material.  When they say that &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; only &quot;inspired&quot; the movie &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; brother, they are not kidding.  &quot;Blade Runner&quot; took a story written in Phillip K. Dick's usual absurdist style and gave it flesh and blood.  Dick's writing is quite philosophical and tends to leave you cold as a reader.  Often his characters act in ways that seem to make little sense on a narrative level.  &quot;Androids&quot; is no exception to this.  The concepts are great, but the details are baffling.  For instance, could anyone really live on an Earth mired in the throes of a post nuclear holocaust raidiation cloud?<br />Ultimately, comparing &quot;Androids&quot; to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is quite unfair to both.  &quot;Blade Runner&quot; represents that rare science fiction film with more brains than brawn while &quot;Androids&quot; is a typical Phillip K. Dick mindbender.  If you like his stuff, you'll like this book.  If you're contemplating reading it just because you liked the movie, don't waste your time.
0440180295|3.0|I definitely enjoyed some of the humor and the innovative structure of the book.  Regarding the latter, I've become so accustomed to seeing movies and reading books in an out-of-order fashion and it's fun to do so.  Always there will be some confusion at the beginning, but the order of events clears up.  The humor was more of this ludicrous type - the type where you're reading something and you say to yourself &quot;Well that is just silly&quot; because it was written to be like that.  But maybe my complaint stems from that in regard to the whole alien kidnapping thing. When I started reading that, I could not take this book seriously anymore.  Was that the Vonnegut's intent?  This is what war can do to a person?  This is how a person reacts to war?  Billy becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot; so he doesn't think about war or face the realities of war?  If Vonnegut wants to say that war is silly and pointless, well of course it is - we all agree on that.<br />Basically Billy went mildly insane and this is what the book details in its plot.  Maybe the point did get across to me, but it was a point not worth repeating again and again.  I was looking for something a little deeper or more meaningful.
B000000OYN|2.0|No wonder Coverdale recorded again the tracks &quot; CRYIGN IN THE RAIN&quot; and &quot;HERE I GO AGAIN&quot; in his smash hit album WHITESNAKE ( 1987 ). These are the only two worthwhile songs in this album. But, for US$ 6,97, you may buy it...
0789723107|4.0|I once took part in a Web design exercise which set the participants a &quot;budget&quot;: we sliced up an imaginary heap of money for spending on design activities, all listed on cards. At the end of the exercise, my team had one hundred imaginary dollars unspent. So on a blank card we scribbled a new category - &quot;lunch with the guy who controls the pursestrings&quot; - and assigned the $100 to that. This whimsical touch started heads nodding all around the group. Everyone in the group agreed that creating a usable Web site required real organisational commitment, commitment that could only come from senior management. And most of the designers and design managers around the table that day wanted to build such support. But few knew how to teach their colleagues about the importance of site usability.<br />Enter Steve Krug, with a book you can hand to your collegues and your manager for them to browse overnight, a carefully-crafted little volume that will sell Web site usability painlessly to your colleagues. As a bonus, most usability practitioners will enjoy its stylish condensations themselves.<br />By the standard of current texts like Joann Hackos and Janice Redish's hefty User and Task Analysis for Interface Design or Jakob Nielsen's ubiquitous Designing Web Usability, this book is a carnival midget - eleven large-print chapters, some under 2000 words long, the text broken up by scores of cartoons and other pictures. As Krug himself suggests, he's created the Classics Illustrated version of all those bigger usability texts, the comic-book version that tells you what's in the big books you haven't read.<br />The Classics Illustrated approach starts with the name. Krug titles his book Don't Make Me Think. Like everything that follows it, that title packs maximum effect into minimum space. Krug calls the phrase his First Law of Usability:<br />&quot;When I look at a Web page it should be self-evident. Obvious. Self-explanatory. I should be able to 'get it' - what it is and how to use it - without expending any effort thinking about it.&quot;<br />When Krug talks of eliminating effort, he's targeting mental effort that holds up the user for even fractions of seconds. The defining chapter of Don't Make Me Think (available online) argues that site designers work as though users will pore over every detail of their work, when they should expect users to take almost no work at all. In particular:<br />- Users don't read; we scan.<br />- Users don't make optimal choices; we look for the first good-enough solution (a process that economics calls &quot;satisficing&quot;).<br />- Users don't figure out how things work; we muddle through.<br />In other words, designers should think &quot;roadside billboard&quot; rather than &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot;.<br />Krug doesn't ruthlessly strip out material the way the billboard analogy implies. Indeed, many of his page designs look almost as cluttered as anyone else's. But the principle holds. If you want your site used, pare everything down to the essentials.<br />Actually, the principle of paring everything back has produced good design for thousands of years. The book itself works because it has slimmed the messages of Web site usability down to an essential core. It makes itself useful to designers by powerfully reinforcing a handful of key ideas that most designers already use. It makes itself useful to the designer's non-designer colleagues by teaching those ideas in a concise but highly engaging style. It is least useful when it tries to dig deeper into issues such as navigation design.<br />Before Don't Make Me Think, Steve Krug was a relatively obscure figure in Web site usability. His book suggests a flourishing consultancy practice, and contains endorsements by the likes of information designer Richard Saul Wurman and designer Roger Black. But Krug's most convincing qualification is Don't Make Me Think itself. Like some of the very best Web sites, it lets its audience learn without ever feeling that they've had to make an effort.ithout ever feeling that they've had to make an effort.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|What T.S. Eliot and Rimbaud did for poetry...introduce modern imagery into poetry, Bjork does for music more so than any other musician of our time.  This is especially true for &quot;Cvalda&quot;.  She incorporates the clanging and clinking of the factory into an eerily beautiful groove.<br />The setting is modern day industrialized setting into which Bjork breathes the fire of of something new, old and shamanistic.<br />Thomas Seay
B00003CXB2|5.0|wow. i just say, they did a superb job in creating this DVD. the extras are all wonderful, the menus great, but just the film itself. i had a widescreen copy on tape, and the colors and sound transfered over to the DVD are amazingly perfect. i was amazed at the colors, how full and rich they were. good job to the creators of this DVD!
0345440757|3.0|I thought this book was very good.  It helped us to get our baby on a schedual and therefore made our lives slightly more sane.  Our daughter is 10 weeks old and slept throught the night when she was 5 weeks old.  I use this book and the book &quot;On Becoming Babywise&quot; as references.  Both have the same ideas as far as getting them on a schedual.  &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot; says to go to the baby whenever she cries.  &quot;On Becoming Babywise&quot; says to let them cry it out.  I think there needs to be a happy medium between the two.  That is why I say I use them both.  Bot agree that the baby should feed, play and then sleep.  Neither tells what you are supposed to do if the baby falls asleep after a feed and you cannot get her to wake up.
0393312836|4.0|I saw the movie first and was blown away by how disturbing and real it was.  While it is true that I and many others have been de-sensitized to violence, the book delves into a different kind of violence.  I guess what scared me after reading A Clockwork Orange was that we do not really know why Alex was &quot;evil&quot;.  Alex would do his thing every night, come home to sleep, then in the morning, gets up and eat breakfast and usually goes to school. What is up with this guy?<br />Usually when you see movies or read books that involve killings and other types of violence, you can always trace the reason to a person or an event that happened previously.  Even in the Columbine shootings and others like it, the kids had reasons and they acted out this anger.<br />But in A Clockwork Orange, Alex chose this evil.  This freaks me out.  It's not I find the other type acceptable, but when shoud people ever have a choice between a good and evil lifestyle?<br />Anyway, the book was good.  It took me like 15 minutes to read the first three pages because of the Nadsat language.  Make a printout of the words and keep it on hand when reading.  The first-person narrative was great and I do think the movie makes the book better because you don't quite get all the emotions of Alex out of the book.  For example, you can hear him laugh and giggle during a rape scene in the movie - something you can never get from a book even if you have a great imagination.  Then reading about his trip to the chair to watch the films - wow - it was described so well - you actually had to feel for the guy.<br />I did get a little turned off by the politics - maybe that is because I always get turned off by politics.  But this book was great!!
B000003N7K|5.0|Of all the CDs in my jazz collection, this is one of those I treasure most. John Coltrane's tender and sensitive accompaniments are a refreshing contrast to the &quot;sheets of sound&quot; reputation for which he is better known. However, for all of Coltrane's greatness, make no mistake:Johnny Hartman is THE star of this recording. His warm baritone is enthralling and irresistible throughout. The highlight of this outing is Lush Life, and Hartman gives THE definitive version of that timeless standard. It is absolute perfection. Hartman's version never has been, and never will be surpassed. We can only speculate why Hartman did not enjoy greater acclaim while he lived. I only know that since I first heard him on the radio in 1993, my life has been richer as a result. As an aspiring singer myself, this CD is a must for anyone who wants to hear it done at the highest, most intimate level.
B00003CXN4|2.0|Okay, I guess Ive been spoiled by the likes of Gladiator and The Perfect Storm. But I realize that Steve Soderbergh is a good director (&quot;Out of Sight&quot;). But I was astounded to realize that he had been nominated for THIS!<br />I went to the theater HOPING I'd like this movie. I'd been waiting a while to see it. Ultimately, the movie seemed like a 4 hour drug trip (no pun intended). It felt like you do at 2:00 in the morning, when your'e not sure what's real or not. I don't know if this was intentional or not; I doubt it.<br />Each location is shot with a different filter; Mexico is yellow, DC is blue, etc. Call it inventive, call it annoying, I didn't like it. It gave the movie a fake look to it (especially when it strives to be realistic). <br />My main problem is that it is not a good movie to sit down and watch. It is NOT entertaining. It probably does do a good job of protraying the world of drug traffic. And I do recommend it to anyone who takes drugs or wants to. This movie is too long, and there are hardly any characters to sympathize with besides Michael Douglas. And, as in real life, there is no 'Hollywood Ending'. After watching this 3 hour movie, I was very disappointed at the ending. I felt I had wasted my time. <br />Thank God we can all look forward to &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; on Memorial Day, May 28.
0060278234|5.0|Sabriel set the stage for what begins to take place in Lirael.  Once again we meet Touchstone and Sabriel in their quest to put the dead to rest who reek havoc, harm and destruction on their beloved &quot;Old Kingdom,&quot; a world that exists right next to modern England and only separated by a wall filled with powerful charter magic.  However, unaware that they have a new ally in Lirael and her faithful companion, they leave the &quot;Old Kingdom&quot; entering the modern world of politics in hopes to keep people who cannot protect themselves in this magical kingdom from crossing the border into the &quot;Old Kingdom.&quot;  Lirael our new herione, just as spunky and likeable as Sabriel with the aid of her faithful friend begins a self-discovery into who she really is, what her path will be and how she alone holds the power to save the Old Kingdom and its heir from imminent destruction.  In her search, she follows a history full of dark, old magic that will eventually return everyone to the beginning of charter magic.  This book reads quickly and brings the characters to life easily.  You can lose yourself in the story.  Somewhat graphic in its description of everything, even evil parasitic death forms; it never dumbs down the subjects of death, pain, betrayal and hurt that life can bring.  This novel will please even the pickiest of thriller readers.  Well Done, Garth!
039472903X|4.0|I have owned three copies of this book. I wore out the first one; it fell apart. The second one was stolen. The third one sits on the shelf of my office. And when I need a little inspiration, even a little reassurance that what I'm doing as an ad writer has a purpose, I go to this book. I equate it as the advertising equivalent to EB White's &quot;Elements of Style.&quot;<br />Granted, Ogilivy was a bleeding egomaniac, one of those eccentric types who believed what he believed and God forbid you should prove him different. But in this book, he does admit some mistakes he had made in his career regarding approaches and ideas. <br />Still, a lot has changed in advertising since this book was published and I find myself looking at the ads inside for inspiration now, more than Ogilvy's somewhat self-serving commentary. Which is probably as it should be.<br />Oh, that Bill Bernbach had written a book like this before he died!

B000001H00|5.0|It's all music. At one time you don't hear the violin and the violonist himself is not a presence anymore. All you hear is sound so pure and coming so straight from the place souls are born that all is an unbelievable experience. <br />Talking by the fire maybe you can remember about tehnique, about dance, virtuosity and so on but when you are just listening is all about finding things that you believe in singing to you. You meet yourself in a way possible only trough music.<br />Maybe this is the best of all recorded sets (I haven't listen to all) but sure is one that can set a standard. But believe me you won't care about any classifications once you've listened to it.<br />A very must for everyone music is a life keeper.

B00004YYDI|4.0|If you have seen the american version of this film, you may be in the majority of viewers that feel that it was a pretty cool movie in the beginning, and had a great ending, but slow and a bit pointless throughout the middle.  This is the main problem with the &quot;cut&quot; version that hit the theaters here in the U.S. years ago.  This full version bridges the opening and closing action with a complete story, a love interest, and it gives Leon a heart.  The extra footage (24 minutes or so) fills in the holes in the story, and it makes more sense.  I liked the Professional, but I loved Leon the Professional.  If you were at all intrigued by the U.S. version, buy this one, you will love it.
6305252521|5.0|FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTO CINEMATAGRAPHY<br />The cinematagraphy on this movie is REALLY, REALLY, REALY nice! And Jim Carrey is ONE of the few actors who are really hard to get ahold off for a movie, once you got him to be in your movie, he is REALLY, REALLY hard to work with. And just by &quot;watching&quot; the Truman Show, i can see he did a great job on it! The Truman Show was ALMOST nominated for the academy awards, and i think i should have because of the nice shots, and that's mainly what they look at! The story is good too, it's a silly little beautiful story, plus it's funny.

0385335482|4.0|A fun and light hearted tale of a Girl who's job and lifestyle are not quite what she hoped for.  What does she do to console this humdrum existense?  Shopping of course, and lots of it.  I love the way the Author took a rather shallow character, Rebecca Bloomwood, and helps her find more substance in her life from all the adversity that her chosen lifestyle creates.  I had a few good laughs and enjoyed the situations the main character is put in.  (The Finnish Bank interview is priceless) If buying a designer label can give as much joy to a person as it does for Rebecca Bloomwood, then the outrageous price for such items just might be warranted.
0788811355|2.0|This movie reminds me of the &quot;Ciderhouse Rules&quot;, in that it is a vehicle for the Contempory wisdom of our time, the unsanctity of life (abortion, and mercy killing). The end of the movie features euthanasia; and defends the mercy killing with the rationale of the entire previous juxtaposed amoral plot. ...Ralph Fiennes charactor is the anti-hero, binal, and unredeemed - he struggles not for any good but his own pleasure in the present.  One wonders if the author of the novel was tring to take the double strandard of Occidental  morality and throw it in the West's cultural face? I got this movie by accident at the Video store. I was all set to get &quot;The Bridge on the River Kui&quot;. Instead, I got The English Patient, as liking Ralph Fiennes in &quot;A Dangerous Man&quot;. I should have stayed with the David Lean film. At least it had  moral fiber...
B000002U82|5.0|pink floyds Darkside of the moon is truly a masterpiece.  It goes beyond the ears and penetrates directly into the soul. You can't just listen to it once, you have to listen to it over again and again.  Every time you listen to it you hear something different.  The effects are truly genius.  Considering that there weren't digital effects when this album was released is truly humbling.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead = Pink Floyd of now,  Kid A = DSOTM of now  This album is the birth of a human clone but unlike the first track suggests, nothing is in its right place.  This is evident everywhere in the disk.  Electric beats replace guitars, distorted voices and raw sounds are everywhere as radiohead attempts to create the atmosphere of the planning, birth and life of the clone.  A copy of a tape is never as good as the origional recording.  This album is so far ahead of its time just as radiohead is with the entire music industry.  I have tried to understand it completely but it is impossible without actually sitting down with the 5 genius's from Oxford.  Any band that can create an exceptional concept album deserves to be put on a higher pedastal than other musicians.  Srgt Peppers, DSOTM, The Downward Spiral, OK Computer, Kid A.  Radiohead has made 2 and i have heard the newest album, its another masterpiece.  When listening to this album if possible get a winamp plugin called G force, and play it to the CD on your computer, this album is incredible, please keep an open mind because this band will tell you a story if you can comprehend it.
1577311523|5.0|This book is about living in the now to find peace and  happiness. We all spend so much time consumed with past hurts and the possibility of an unpleasant future that we are unable to live in the now. I have gained progress toward the goal of living in the now by studying this book and the book An Encounter With A Prophet. If you would like to give up bringing emotional garbage into your present and stop worrying about the future I recommend you read both books.
B000059R8Y|3.0|I'm glad to see Clapton got back from the polished ,over produced vacation he took with the last album of his own,Pilgrim...But then again,he doesn't owe us anything.To me, he has the right to play anything he wants.But I'm happy to see he's back doing what he does best.Blues,ballads,and things inbetween...    I think this one is worthy of buying no matter when you became a Clapton fan.It shows all of his styles with a grace that can only come with the kind of life he has led,and let us as fans in on.    After all these years he is still Eric Clapton...a REPTILE...
B00004SPYJ|2.0|The film looks great, the music is legendary, so why can't I recommend this love story?  I have two quibbles, and they are BIG ones:  1) For those who haven't seen the film, the titular star-crossed lovers of this piece both commit suicide, and this is a bad message to be sending today's youth.  Would it not have made for a more happy and dramatic ending had the Capulets and the Montegues worked out their differences?  My second knock is levelled against the film's screenwriter.  People talk REALLY weird in this movie and half the time I couldn't figure out what they were saying!!!  To sum up, this film is an incoherent and socially irresponsible mess!
B00000HYXB|5.0|I love the sound of this album.  If there had been metal back in mid-evil times, this is what it would sound like.
B000009EHU|5.0|All right everyone says THE SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i am telling you this is the funniest movie ever made for horror. I laughed the hole time. I think it was a good movie but it was very funny. I especially enjoy the scene in which Linda Blair pretens to be and airplane. I laughed my head off and i think you should rent it and scare your friends because that was the whole point of why this movie was made. AND IT IS A VERY GOOD HORROR MOVIE IT IS MY FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE.
B00001W0FD|3.0|&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; (the 1962 original, not the 1998 direct to video piece of crap called &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;), although maybe not the best or most well known horror film ever made, is certainly one of the most creepy and unsettling movies I have ever seen.<br />The film is about a young, pretty woman who, after having &quot;died&quot; in a car accident, finds herself being stalked by a pale, ghost-like figure who comes to her in nightmarish otherworldly visions of desperation and despair.<br />&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; is a cinematic wonder that just goes to show that you don't need a big name score composer, a big time director and cast, or a huge budget to make a good movie.  This is a true-to-form 1960's, black and white, B grade horror film that sets out to do one thing and one thing only, shock the living daylights out of the person viewing it.  It may not be the best movie ever made, and at times it can be quite corny and over-acted, but those factors only add to the nostalgic quality of the film.<br />To sum it all up, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; is a true horror movie gem that should not be missed by die hard fans of the genre (or anybody for that matter).<br />By the way, just in case your reading this review and wondering exactly how chilling this movie could actually possibly be, George Romero once said that &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; was constantly on his mind while directing the original 1968 horror classic &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;.
6305358567|3.0|While this is an engaging and entertaining movie, it rides roughshod over the facts of history.  Most of the events in it are factual, but the movie makes it appear that they all happened over the course of perhaps five years.  In fact, it took over thirty years or more for most of them to play out.<br />Watch it for entertainment, but NOT history.
B000008DA5|5.0|i have been obsessed with the smiley smile record for quite some time now.  oh, sure, i own a few smile bootlegs that hint at a more magnificent record, but smiley smile definitly stands on it's own.  although the version of heroes and villians on this record is a near travesty, everything else shines, even compared to their smile counterparts.  vegetables is amazing.  and lets not forget wild honey, a good album in it's own right, worth about three or four stars.  the title track has an amazing hook in the chorus.

B000002H1T|5.0|My introduction to The Cars was hearing the haunting Drive on the radio in 1984, watching its hypnotic psychiatric patient video on TV had me hooked.  Hearing the sublime title track Heartbeat City was the impetus to buy the album, and I was not disappointed with what I found.<br />Now I was a new romantic boy (minus frilly shirts and make-up) so I was drawn to the keyboard sound used in this era, so I am not what I would consider the typical The Cars fan.  I am aware that a lot of these fans hate this album, and after hearing the Greatest Hits album can understand why.  The change in style for this album was quite significant, but for me I never heard anything previous that surpassed anything on this album.  I'm not sure if it was the involvement of Mutt Lange or just the natural evolvement of their sound, but whatever the cause the result was good.<br />The song Drive was also used an anthem during the build-up and the concert Live Aid, new video footage of the starving Ethiopians instead of the original video.  The lyric &quot;you can't go on thinking nothings wrong&quot; seemed to be what brought this to the organisers attention.  Not much of a link to the heart rending situation, but then you can forgive them a bit of poetic licence.  The Cars played both this and Heartbeat City during their Live Aid performance, one of my many highlights of that day in 1985.<br />The follow-up to this album in 1988/89 was a flop, and they split up shortly after.  This album should be their epitaph.  Die hard fans aside, I defy any 80's music lovers not to like this album.
B000002N2P|5.0|Of course, the collective punk world held their breath when Green Day released the follow-up to Dookie, arguably the most important punk record to ever hit the scene.  Dookie was the album that brought orthodox punk rock into the mainstream.  Some would argue that Nirvana did it, but I can't really say that Kurt's grungier punk spoke for the whole genre.  But I digress.  So in summary, was Insomniac what everyone hoped for?<br />Damn straight!<br />This is, without doubt, the hardest, fastest album Green Day ever did.  The crunching guitar riffs, snarling, sarcastic lyrics from Billie Joe Armstrong (literally a genious in that area), excellent bass work from Dirnt (one of the greatest punk bassists I've ever heard), and Tre Cool's insane speed and cut-time beats reign supreme here.  Although I never though about it before, I must say there is a SLIGHT bit of metalish sound in here, but there's no question it's a PUNK album.  86, Westbound Sign, Jaded, and Walking Contradiction are arguably some of the best songs the band has ever done (my vote goes to 86) and the songs are just brimming with energy and creativity.  The ONLY hitch is that sometimes the three-chord songs get a little redundant just because you know you've heard it before somewhere.  It's not quite as good overall as Nimrod simply because Nimrod had so many styles and variation on it, but it's damn close.  Buy it.
B00003CWTI|2.0|Daring? Inventive? Full of surprises? Did anyone who described this film with these words actually see it? Where exactly are all the coincidences we hear so much about? Where is the miraculous movie announced at the start? PT Anderson shoots his bolt in the pre credits sequence. Everything that follows resembles an expensive, beautifully shot and star-studded student film. A bad student film. Cruise is good, but not on peak form. The writing gives him no more than a bunch of underwritten speeches that leave me wondering why no redraft of the script was ordered. I really liked Boogie Nights, but this one was dire. I was sitting in front of it waiting for something great to happen, until I realised that about 15 minutes were left. Then it started raining frogs. Had the whole movie been so absurd, I might have actually loved it. But after almost three hours of whining, crying and unconvincing melodramising - bang, it rains frogs. 'This is something that happens' says one character. Brace me people, I'm about to burst open with admiration. Is this some kind of great hidden truth?  The movie might have worked if the melodrama beforehand hadn't been so darned heavy handed. It reminds me of Vincent Minnelli's THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, wherin a great director instructs Kirk Douglas that to shoot every scene like a climax would make a very bad director. Every moment in Magnolia is shot like a grandstanding Oscar moment, with overdone music and emotions, exhausting anyone with taste and judgement. Look at Lynch's The Straight Story. Less is more. Magnolia would have seemed excessive to Douglas Sirk even. At least Sirk balanced things out.  Those who love it - well I just don't get you people. I love movies from A to Z. I love Chaplin, Spielberg; Bresson, and, er, even Kevin Smith. Hell, I rate PT Anderson very highly. But he sure laid a rotten one with this film. He should learn to be less precious with his feet of film and more self critical. Not every movie has the capacity to be an epic. I rate it 2 stars for the songs, the outtakes and the pre credits sequence.
B000059XUI|2.0|I saw this film recently, and it just didn't hold up over time.  The story is still great, and general Zod rules...but a lot of the movie came across as...cheesey.  The scene where Zod and gang terrorize New York was just plane silly, and New York looked like a sound stage.  It's too bad, because this was one of my favorite films as a child.  Maybe your kids will like it, but as a previous fan...the magic was gone.<br />On a positive note, I saw the Wrath of Khan recently as well, and that movie did hold up!

Take hold of the magic, and roar your terrible roars, claw those claws, and please, roll your yellow eyes.

If Steve Perry was singing with the heart and soul of Steve Augeri on this album the album would have been awesome.

B00000IPAX|5.0|Alright, Alright, laugh all you want....I like this CD, so im reviewing it....its good, I know a lot of you think there 'sellouts' and what not, but not to me, there still the same old Blink. I think this is there second best release (Behind Cheshire Cat) and it deserves the recognition it has earned the band... The CD starts off with &quot;Dumpweed&quot;, one of the better songs on the CD in my opinion. The chorus is catchy as hell. &quot;Dont Leave Me&quot; is next, its a pretty good song. &quot;Aliens Exist&quot; is up next, Tom finally got his way, and got to write a song about his fetish, Aliens....I dont hate the song, but its not the best thing on the cd or anything. ''Going Away To College&quot; is one of my two favorite songs on the CD, the guitars/drums/lyrics all fit together perfectly, its a good punk rock love song. Next is &quot;Whats My Age Again&quot; ya ya ya, everyone hates it cause it got big, oh well, its a good song. &quot;Dysentery Gary&quot; is a good song, but not a lot like the 'normal' blink....the next two songs are the other two 'radio' songs, &quot;Adams Song&quot; and &quot;All The Small Things&quot;, both are good songs, and &quot;Adams Song&quot; has a really positive message, despite what some people think or do. &quot;The Party Song&quot; is a song about going to partys (If that wasnt obvious) It tells about how he doesnt like partys, cause people are fake, and are just in it to get some 'action'. &quot;Mutt&quot; is a song about Sex, flat out, I hated this song when I first heard it on 'The Show' comp, but Ive grown to love it, its one of my favs on the cd. &quot;Wendy Clear'' is another punk rock love song, good song. and finally &quot;Anthem&quot; (The second of my two favorites) is about playing a show at a friends house and having the kids parents show up, and cops as well, and all getting busted, and Tom threw some somewhat serious lyrics into it as well. My overall rating of the cd is 'Great', everyone should have this, who cares if it got Blink popular. Im happy for there sucess, and wish em more luck.....everyone go buy it, if you dont already have it.
1570429596|3.0|I grew up with &quot;money is the root of all evil&quot; mindset drilled into me. Lately (after making some real money, of course), I've had a partial change of heart. Money itself is neither good nor evil. It's a tool. It can be a hammer or a sword. <br />&quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; is born from a mindset the opposite of mine, which is &quot;money is a good thing&quot;. I bought this book-on-tape to try and understancd a point of view that I don't customarily ascribe to, so I could evaluate my own assumptions and predjudices.<br />Mr. Kiyosaki's take on how the middle class and the poor view money is pretty accurate. Most of their (our?) financial decisions are based upon an emotional response: fear and/or greed. To really succeed financially, one must learn self-discipline. Absolutely, I agree. <br />However, in lumping emotions into one pile, he fails to credit what most financially successfully people attribute their success to: The Gut. Instinct. Knowing deep down when to move forward and when to retreat.<br />Mr. Kiyosaki also seems to have glossed over (either intentionally or out of self-delusion) the fact that his wealth building tactics exploit the disadvantaged. Even though he asserts (correctly) that our educational system fails to teach us the fundamentals of finance, in all probability his own fortune was built on the misinformed mistakes of others. He seems to justify it with the tired old excuse that the poor are poor because they deserve to be. From what I've seen, the real reasons are far more complex and insidious.<br />At the end, to prove that he's really an ok guy, he reminds us that generousity is paramount to being happy and wealthy. Give and ye shall receive. Not that I disagree with this philanthropic philosophy, but I wonder how sincere he really is about this. After all, donations to charity make great tax write-offs.<br />So overall, I'd say I learned a thing or two here about how the rich think and that may even help me build my ownwealth. However,  I don't plan on taking advantage of others. Of course, a bargain is a bargain...
B00000J631|4.0|It's the newest project from one of punk rock's most innovative minds today, Fat Mike... 101 bands on one album playing 30 seconds-and-under songs. The album taps the scenes of over ten countries, and leave it to Fat Mike to collect the most varied lineup of punk, old-school, hardcore, emo, ska, and radio bands of any compilation. So unplug your phone, remove all distractions, and lock yourself in your room before listening or else you might miss half of the bands. Don't plan on doing anything afterwards either, because your attention span will be completely shot.<br />There are a lot of cool tracks on the comp, mostly from bands that have mastered the art of the short song, such as the Descendents. The lineup features everything from legends like Bad Religion, Black Flag, and the Subhumans to today's popular punk bands like NOFX, Pennywise, and the Bouncing Souls. But with such a screwy setup, you're bound to get plenty of bands that don't really take the project seriously, and there are some disappointments. Out of 101 bands, though, what did you expect? There's enough good stuff that you can skip over the crap and still get your fix. Plus, the full-color booklet features a little something from each band, including as pictures, contact information, lyrics, or random band jokes. It's hard to take this CD seriously, but it's a good opportunity to hear a wide mix of punk bands or just sit around with some friends and see who can name the most bands (or count which bands can swear the most in under 30 seconds).
B000059MEK|5.0|I have never heard of Daft Punk until I heard 'One More Time' on the radio and instantly fell in love with it. Then I saw the video and enjoyed the song even more so I decided it was time to buy the CD. It was a great choice. The music has great beats and never slows down for a minute. This is a great CD to get you in the mood for a night at the clubs, or if you just want to listen to something upbeat to get you going for the day.
0451457994|5.0|I read quite a lot of Arthur C. Clarke in late childhood and reread as an adult what I considered then to be his best works. I've decided this is the best of his best. The movie version, by the way, depends utterly on its soundtrack, and contrary to popular misconception very little of that is Richard Strauss's music. No, over thirty minutes of Gyorgy Ligeti's music, especially his &quot;Atmospheres&quot;, is crucial. <br />I recommend interested readers get hold of Richard Toop's GYORGY LIGETI (20TH-CENTURY COMPOSERS).
B00001NFCY|3.0|In Response to Mark Delaney:    If you are seriously looking into buying this CD, I would.  It is a great addition to any collector's libray.  Although I have to agree with one of Mark's points about Creed, in that, they tend to use the same guitar riffs over and over, but, the moving lyrics make up for it quite well.  The lyrics are hardly &quot;cheesy&quot; and have a Christian influence, which is even better.  The riff in 'Higher' is hardly annoying, but I guess that depends on the person.  I guess our friend Mark is more of the 'pure' grunge rock personality, such as Perl Jam or Alice in Chains.  Over all Creed is a great buy and the entire CD is worth listening to.  That's not something I can say for the latest Pearl Jam.  Creed Rocks!  :-)
0446677450|3.0|The short and to the point review of this book is it is basically a financial philosophy outline.  I found no specific formulas, but I found an impressive attitude and mind frame for success.<br />I highlighted 14 specific ideas.  Heres the top 3. 1.Investment risk is always reduced if you love what u r investing in, understand it and know the game.<br />2.Wize business is working with and hiring individuals who are more intelligent than yourself.<br />3.Corporations are one of the biggest secrets of the rich.<br />I think if the book had more specific guidlines for accumilating wealth I would have rated it higher.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Buffalo Springfield was a band more known for what it's members did after they left, than the great music they made as this short lived group. Although only together 18 months, they were the blueprint for some of the most successful country rock bands to come, such as CSN, Poco, and the Eagles, along with about every other west coast rock group. The songs on this retrospective, which originally came out in 1969, just after their breakup, were written by either Steven Stills or Neil Young. The lone exception being &quot;Kind Woman&quot;, which was penned by Richie Furay, who later recorded it again with his band Poco. The first song here, and probably their most famous single &quot;For What It's Worth&quot;, established Steven Stills as a great songwriter. It also had that catchphrase in it, &quot;There's something happening here/what it is ain't exactly clear&quot;, which was a popular line in 60's counterculture at the time. Another great Stills song is &quot;Bluebird&quot;, which features some nice  guitar work. It starts out as an all out rock song, then comes that famous guitar interlude, and then switches gears and becomes a banjo driven country song. Absolutely brilliant! Not to be outdone is Neil Young. He pens 3 great tunes in a row, starting with &quot;On The Way Home&quot;. I love this song. With it's horn arrangements, it's different than any other Buffalo song. &quot;Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing&quot; is a beautiful folk rock song with CSN type harmonies. His masterpiece here is &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. A unique song that has a bit of everything in it, from full orchestration with a bolero type of drumbeat, mixed with a countryrock sound with numerous rhythm changes. This song rivals anything those boys from Liverpool were doing at the time. There may not have been a better songwriter around than Neil Young during the Springfield period leading up to his first 2 brilliant albums &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot;, and &quot;After The Goldrush&quot;. Although this is a relatively small retrospective, every song here is a gem. Buffalo Springfield was one of the most creative bands of the 60's, but because of their strong individual writing and performing talents, this was also the reason for their breakup. This is an excellent historical document of the band that started the whole folk, country rock movement. Highly recommended!

B0000019PA|4.0|If you're looking for new summer music, look no further. Catchy tunes, acoustic guitar and a guy playing the saw. I'm leaving out a lot of other stuff of course. Think the 90's equivalent of the Violent Femmes. Check out the sound samples of the first three songs. If you like it, you probably should buy it.<br />I say again, great summer music.
B0000542DJ|5.0|Ever since I was born I've heard the claim that America is the land of the free, with a strong belief in freedom of speech. Why, then, does a film that presents an opinion get dragged through the mud?<br />Before seeing the film I'd read many books regarding the assassination. Going in, I had my own opinion that Oswald could not have killed Kennedy. There was definitely the possibility that he'd been involved, but he couldn't have done the shooting.<br />This film presents the idea that the CIA had been invloved - something I agree with - but primarily it follows the case of Clay Shaw. Personally, I don't believe he had been involved. And if he was, it was unknowingly. Like Oswald, I think he was used. Like many people it would seem.<br />The films most positive trait is its willingness to leave room for you to come to your own conclusions. It presents many well known, and some not so well known, facts. As an assistant to Jim Garrison [our main character] says, when referring to Oswald supposedly doing the shooting from the Book Depository, &quot;that's the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting&quot;. Coupled with all the reports of witnesses to a man behind the fence on the knoll, and the clear evidence that more than three shots were fired, we know that many of the reports are a fabrication.<br />The most important question it asks is not who killed Kennedy, but why he was killed. The idea of it having to do with Vietnam is a little far fetched, but worth considering. Garrison's meeting with Mr. X is especially revealing, when you discover how much basic Secret Service protocall was ignored that day.<br />The special features are excellent. Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful, and the 50 minutes of cut scenes worth watching twice [with and without commentary]. Also impressive was the enourmous amount of chapter selections, coming in at over 80. The multimedia essays are a little dull, but it's to be expected. A lot of effort has gone in to this DVD and it shows.<br />The film is, despite your opinion of what actually happened that day, excellent. The brilliant editing, along with John Williams' usual top notch score, cap off an already intriguing concept.<br />Watch with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.

The two of them discuss dying, love, children, and many other important facts of life.  They also discuss what it's like to die, and why you shouldn't be afraid to die, you should be afraid not to live.  It's a book that makes you take a look at your own life and think hard about the way you live from day to day.  It also makes you appricate what you have while you have it.
0446608955|4.0|A very touching remembrance of life at seventeen, told by fifty-seven- year-old Landon Carter. Son of a senator away from his family most of Landon's life, Landon lives in the shadow of his family wealth he knows was acquired by his grandfather at the expense of many of the citizens in his home town. <br />Landon is painfully aware that his own minister, Hegbert as he refers to him, was one of the people his grandfather duped during a time when Hegbert worked with Landon's grandfather. Although Landon believes Hegbert preaches &quot;at him&quot; in every &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; sermon he gives, Landon &quot;unwillingly&quot; becomes associated with his daughter, perceived as a strange, religious girl Landon describes as plain, ordinary, and the kind of young person every adult admires. <br />Through his participation in the Christmas play, written by Hegbert, Landon begins to see this girl, who is not like anyone he knows, from a different perspective. And, in the end, we understand how Landon's life changed forever when he was seventeen. <br />I've enjoyed getting to know Nicholas Sparks as an author, who has portrayed feelings of youth we can remember and thoughts about the past that only come with age and experience.
0440416027|5.0|This novel offers many gifts. Written by British author, David Almond, Skellig has been awarded the Michael L. Printz Award for excellence in young adult Literature; this is a story layered with elements that will surprise and delight.  Recommended for readers 10 years and up, the storyline is by no means juvenile.<br />Michael is ten, an age that requires that the beliefs and interests of an earlier age be put away forever.  But sometimes circumstances provide a need to believe in the possibility of magic for just a little while longer - to belive that by wishing it so, a life can be saved.  And so this beautifully told story unfolds.<br />Michael and his family have just moved into a new house, a larger one to provide space for the new baby that is soon to be born.  The house itself is old, neglected and the very place where the previous owner, Ernie Myers died.  Michael is not happy about this move because everything is different, everything is sad. The baby has arrived too soon, there are complications.  She cannot breathe.  He cannot sleep at night, things are not going well at school  His parents are distraught about the baby, there are trips back and forth from the hospital.  Michael is consumed by worry!  Then, at the back of the old, falling down garage, behind a tea chest, he discovers Skellig, a most unusual being in need of help.  Together with his first true friend Mina, Michael finds a reason to hope, and the courage to believe in the power of Divine Intervention.<br />David Almond writes with sensitivity, and with just the right amount of insight into the world of ten year olds. Life is not about play, and yet, David Almond provides humour in measureable amounts throughout this novel. The chapters are divided into well written scenes that will make every reader anxious to see what will happen next.  Hope there will be sequels.
B0000203Y5|5.0|This terrific movie shows that the poverty of communism does not inevitably lead to poverty of the human spirit. I do not have much to add to previous excellent reviews.  Rather, my intent is to urge readers and viewers to consider an excellent companion movie: &quot;For Love or Country: Arturo Sandoval&quot; (a &quot;true&quot; story&quot;).  This well made for TV film also has outstanding Cuban vibes plus romance, and drama. More importantly, Arturo Sandoval reveals the bankruptcy of the the Cuban revolution and how it has depreciated the humanity it has subjected its self upon.  Worth seeing for the entertainment alone, the political truth is unmistakable and unavoidable.
068484267X|5.0|In an amazing way Mr.McCourt is able to present his thoughts as a child in the mature age he now is; There were moments that I cried reading this book and many others that I laughed out loud (being in Frankfurt International Airport as well) and I think that we all know that not many scripts can make a person laugh out loud in public; It's amazing, fulfilling, sad and funny, but most of all, a life statement and a good written one; I highly recommend it............
B00004RFFU|5.0|What amazes me is what little violence/gore and little scariness this adaptation of Anne Rice's popular 1980s book. It cuts down to the chase and holds true to the tenderness and fascination that Anne Rice's vampire books contain. Tom Cruise cuts down his clean-cut image, dons a long blond wig and does a good job playing the casual Lestat, while Brad Pitt also does an impressionable job as Louis. Both do a commendable job as a screen duo, and both actors need to take on more roles like 'Interview,' instead of an hot-shot sports agent (&quot;Jerry Maguire.&quot;) and a guy out to get his lover (&quot;The Mexican.&quot;) Roles like these best fit their quiet, pleasing dispositions, and they should do a prequel like &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;, or maybe one of Anne Rice's standalone recents like &quot;Vittorio The Vampire.&quot; Rated R for mild language, sexual content, nudity, and some vampire violence/gore.
0880389052|5.0|Homeland was the first Forgotten Realms novel I ever read, after having played Dungeons and Dragons for about a year. Homeland progressed to Exile, Sojurn and the entire series to date based on the renegade dark (drow) elf, Drizzt Do'Urden.

B00000DGXN|4.0|One of the more delightful surprises of the late 80s was the 'Reunion' CD in which Gary Burton reunited with Pat Metheny to produce a handful of beautiful tunes, aided by the likes of Pete Erskine.  It illustrated the changes in both musicians' approaches since their previous collaboration, 'Passengers', which for me is still the highlight of their joint careers.  With 1998's 'Like Minds', Burton assembled an even more stellar cast to close out another decade.<br />But to be honest, I was slightly disappointed by the result.  As artists get older, there is a tendency for the amount of care and effort they put into each new artefact to be inversely proportional to the amount of wealth they have already accumulated.  These guys are outstanding musicians, and perhaps they feel that their most outstanding contributions are behind them, and they want to spend more time enjoying their wealth with their families.  In the liner notes, Burton says that most of the recordings on the album were first takes.  This is useful to know, but it puts me off.  I want to read that months of effort went into the composition of each album, not they knocked it off in less than a week, so that Pat Metheny could go off and do yet another rushed collaboration with someone else.<br />That said, as a Gary Burton album, this is one of his best.  In retrospect, 'Passengers' is dominatd by the emergence of Metheny as brilliant guitarist and songwriter.  But here Pat takes a very modest background seat, and lets Corea duel with Burton.  I guess that with three lead instruments you have to be careful not to clutter the recording.  Burton's vibraphone is excellently recorded here, but alas this cannot be said for Corea's piano.  As another reviewer says, it sounds distant and tinny, and it's an awful advert for the Yamaha CF3.  We're almost back to the sound of the early 70s 'Hymn of the 7th Galaxy', which I wouldn't wish upon anyone.<br />Overall good, but a missed opportunity.  Next time, I'd like Corea and Metheny to lock themselves together in a mountain hut somewhere remote for a minimum of six weeks to produce something really outstanding.  It may be unfashionable to say so, but until that happens, I will continue to believe that the guitarist who worked best with Corea was actually Al di Meola.e Corea and Metheny to lock themselves together in a mountain hut somewhere remote for a minimum of six weeks to produce something really outstanding.

B000002C4J|5.0|This has to be Celine's best album to date. 15 great songs in almost every category. Wonderful duets with the likes of The Bee Gees, Barbra Sreisand, Diana King and Brownstone, and Pavarotti make this an album that no Celine fan should do without. Over 70 minutes of terrific music. And of course it features the Titanic song, &quot;My Heart will go on&quot;. This album really showcases Celine's vocal ability. The 18 page booklet contains all lyrics and plenty of photos.
B000056NX5|1.0|A &quot;remake&quot; of an almost-as-bad 1973 movie.  This version updates the story to a &quot;modern&quot; setting.  Hmmm, and this was necessary to...?  The fact that this version didn't last long on B-Way should tell you all you need to know.  Hey, maybe Brittney Spears should remake &quot;Revolver&quot; to bring it into a &quot;Modern&quot; setting. <br />Here's my suggestion, buy the original 1970 JCS on CD.  Sit back and LISTEN to a superb work and a credible (accurate? I have no idea) retelling of the last days of Christ.  The ORIGINAL was fantastic.  Both movie versions are sad, this latest one is beyond sad...
B000002LIR|5.0|This set covers the period from 1964 (Good morning little school girl) to 1989 (Downtown Train). Even though the set is titled 1964-1990, the last song was recorded in 1989. The large format book is packed with photographs, an essay by Robert Palmer, and notes on each song, by Rod himself. This is a 4 cd set that no fan of Rod's should be without. You get not only his big hits, but some lesser known songs and album tracks as well.
6305807086|5.0|I think almost every reviewer will agree that this is one of the most original American films in years. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is wild, outragious and bizarre on many levels. But it is also lyrical and superbly witty. Every time I saw this film I felt like one of my surreal classmates from second grade had grown up and made a movie. But somewhere along the way it seemed that that kid had developed a tremendous understanding of life, of literature and of the audience. <br />One of the refreshing things about &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is that it manages to be wild and unique without trying too hard. It balances an outlandish plot with a subtle and intelligent wit that permeates the entire film.<br />Even the best American films tend to be a little too full of themselves at times. The great thing about this one is that it threw out all assumptions about film making and pushed everything to the envelope WITHOUT any visible trace of effort.
B000002BQK|5.0|I know what a lot of the critics must be thinking: &quot;Yeah, it's another Mariah CD. Let's go ahead and give it a three. You KNOW what it's gonna sound like.&quot; Well, I TOTALLY disagree with them. This album penetrates the body, strengthens the mind, and accentuates the human spirit. Never have I or will I hear such emotion and coloratura all within a 60-minute timeframe. From the the get up and dance &quot;Honey&quot;, to the highly reminiscient &quot;Fourth of July&quot;, all the way to the cover of Prince's &quot;The Beautiful Ones,&quot; and the powerful identity ballad. The lyrics alone on this album make you just wanna get up and create one of your own CDs (which is what I'm working on). Maybe I'm partial to it because I have not only been a fan for over ten years, but because I can relate to about 90% of what Mariah wrote. Don't get me wrong, I like RAINBOW, too, but if you're looking to find Mariah's most personal, intimate, and simply put-&quot;classic&quot; album, then THIS IS THE ONE

B00000163G|5.0|Although Pac's lyrics are shaky at times on this album, the great production on this album and the classic songs make up for the average joints. This album has more of a commercial feel to it than other 2 Pac albums, but the some of the heart-felt emotions that Pac put into his music are still evident on songs like I Ain't Mad At Cha, Life Goes On and Only God Can Judge Me. IMO, this album is a classic because it was released over five years ago and artists are still capitalizing on the trends, images and concepts that came from this album. It is by far, the most enjoyable 2 Pac album that has been released so far and it will remain in heavy rotation in my CD player for years to come. IMO, this is the only hip-hop double disc that is worth the money. Your Pac collection isn't complete without this classic album.
B0000508U6|5.0|Man this CD is one of the best that i have. The whole bands colalboration makes it an amazing sound! The lead singer Guy, has an incredible voice that can change tones for all song. This CD is good for ppl who are hopeless romantics like myself. The songs range from unrequited love, to songs that tell someone that you'll always be there. The songs are moving and are defintely in a new age love song mood. All the lyrics are so moving and great to listen to because it reminds you what a tru love for someone is. So i guarantee if you like a dreary love song CD that you wish you could sing to someone this is it. They might not be all popular now, but they are definitely ranging up there with the best of the best!                                       -GY

0393317552|4.0|... it was fun and educational to read. The fact that most were never taught world history the way it should have been taught had me anticipating each chapter to come. It sort of bogged down for me here and there, but not enough to lose interest. His observations/theories on the rise of civilizations were pretty much on target but seem to peter out after contact with the new world. He also avoided(?) many ancient civilizations that would probably have acted as a monkey wrench thrown into the gears of his theoretical works. Also, another item in which I think should have been given equal space to were the political/religious decisions that most likely had very serious progressive/regressive results ( he used China as one of the examples and I have a few of my own). At the end Diamond acknowledges this point very very briefly, and I'm sure it is because it could have made all the effort of writing this book in the 1st place look like a total waste. Can't blame him for that, but it forces me to hold back on 1 star. Still, more than worth the time and education to be had. I recommend it.

6305232660|5.0|This exciting movie is more a drama than a disaster flick.  I had the privilege of working on the movie as a science advisor and can attest that the producers, director, and writers had a strong commitment to making the movie as realistic as possible within the framework of the human drama they were telling.  The effects of the impact are realistically portrayed, as is the surface of the comet and the overall premise that such an impact could occur.  I believe the realism of this movie makes it much more exciting and dramatic.  Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall are terrific, and there are a number of powerful emotional scenes.

It's a foggy, back of the throat, whiskey and cigarettes album, which is obvious enough if you're a Waits fan. But it's just so pretty. You might try and write odes to it if you're so inclined. The muses have all taken the night trainout of Greece and gone to visit Tom to sit on his lap and whisper in his ear. It's what the Beats wanted to do but failed at. Its the musical equivalent of The Dead. It's divinity. It should be sung in churches with a full choir of drunkards. <br />The Piano has Been Drinking is one of the most comical song poems i've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. Bad Liver and A Broken Heart- Come on. The title is good enough to cruise on. Small Change is right up there with Romeo is Bleeding from the Blue Valentine CD as one of the greatest storytelling tunes ever recorded.
B00003Q43A|5.0|WOW WOW WOW!!! never i've seen such amazement in my life. the story deals with a race of 15-mile spaceships who descend to Earth and destroy all the major cities in the world. it's up to President Whitmore ( Bill Pullman), David ( Jeff Goldblum) and Stephen Hiller ( Will Smith) to save the fourth of july from the apocalypse. It's a wonderful, imaginative, intense, movie experience filled with humor, tears, Action, Explosions, sci-fi references, and everything to fill a action/sci fi lovers taste. you must see or own this Grand and entertaining experience on DVD and it'll make you feel like you went to see it at the movies for the first time.<br />Recommendations: The Fifth Element, Stargate, War of the Worlds,  The Matrix, Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Armageddon, Deep Impact, Con Air, The Rock, Star Wars and Men in Black.<br />ENJOY!!!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is perfect. Period. I've listened to it and re-listened, and I cannot find anything wrong. My only annoyance (and the album is so awesome this does nothing to detract from it), is that on three songs (Brave New World, Blood Brothers, and The Mercenary), the refrains tend towards one or to lines that are repeated. Surprisingly, this doesn't get old or feel repetitive. While there isn't a throwaway song on the album, the highlights are Wickerman, Ghost of the Navigator, The Mercenary, and Thin Line between Love and Hate.<br />The first thing you notice when you put this album in (after the killer opening riffs of the Wickerman, that is) is Bruce's voice. It's never sounded better. The break from the crucshing tour schedule that made him souond so awful on Fear is gone, he's obviously learned a LOT from his solo career. This is arguably the best he's ever been, definitely at his best since Live After Death.<br />The Wickerman hits the ground running, and never loses it. It harder and faster than Aces High, although shorter. Just the opening four notes says this is not a wimpy album, it's going all out.<br />Ghost of the Navigator is an incredible effort, arguably the best song on the album. It starts off with a lyrical guitar section, before the rhythm comes in, and it goes from there. Ghost is one of their best epics ever, comparible to even the mighty Hallowed be thy Name (although falling short of that unreachable mark).<br />The Mercenary is hard, fast, with a killer solo. It's harder than the trooper, although the lyrics fall short. Easily one of Maiden's best &quot;power songs,&quot; it keeps you going from beginning to end.<br />The Thin Line Between Love and Hate can be summed up in one word. Bruce. You've never heard him like this, not with Maiden, not solo, not anywhere. He covers all of his formidible range, at times powerful, at times soaring, never weak. It is incredible to listen to, especially the high, piercing notes of the chorus. This songalone shows why Bruce Dickinson is one of the greatest vocalists ever in rock/metal. Don't get me wrong, though, there's a band behind him, and they're not just sitting there. This is probably the second best song on the album, behind Ghost.<br />Is Brave New World Maiden's best? No. While outstanding, the songs never reach the impact of the never-to-be-equaled Hallowed Be Thy Name (although Ghost tries, and comes closer to succeeding that you would expect). While the power songs, especially Wickerman and Mercenary, can equal anything Maiden has ever done, but the epics and ballads fall short. While technically perfect perfect, the songs just seem to lack the impact of Powerslave or Rime of the Anceint Mariner. But, this is still an awesome album, and easily the best effort put forth by Maiden in years. In fact, I would rate it overall behind only Number of the Beast and Powerslave. The fact that it can't measure up to their absolute best says a lot about just how good Iron Maiden truly is. Brave New World is flawless, it's just that those two went beyond perfection.
B00000JPH6|5.0|No words can describe this flawless and brilliant fantasy classic from Jim Henson. The Story deals with a Elf-like being called a Gelfling who's called &quot; Jen&quot; and must return a Crystal Shard back to the castle of the Dark Crystal before the Vulture-like Monsters called &quot; Skeckis&quot; take over the world and the universe. Entertaining, breathtaking and stunning movie that is one of those that changed my life forever. The Disk here is sharp, clear and meant to be in Widescreen with extras that you fans of Dark Crystal can own.<br />Recommendations: Labyrinth, The Last Unicorn, The Hobbit, The Fifth Element, The Matrix, Return to Oz, Willow, Total Recall,  Stargate, Dune, Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness, Heavy Metal and Highlander.
B00000373U|5.0|i didn't know a whole lot of background information about elliott smith when i first heard his music, and i still haven't seen good will hunting, but after a friend introduced me to his incredible music he has become my favorite musician!  his voice is just plain beautiful!  i can't describe it any other way.  <br />either/or was the first cd i heard by elliott smith, and is probably my favorite out of all the elliott smith albums.  every song is pretty emotional and full of feeling.  the tone is really mellow, and not abrasive like most of the music of today. i personally love &quot;depressing&quot; emotional music, and it makes me feel good.  either/or is perfectly blended between sad and beautiful music.  this is one of the few albums that i can listen to the whole cd straight through.  my personal favorite tracks are:  &quot;between the bars&quot;, &quot;angeles&quot;, &quot;2:45&quot;, &quot;speed trials&quot;, no name no. 5&quot;, etc.  i love every track!<br />this is somewhat sad music, but it doesn't really make you sad.  i am really amazed that this truly gifted artist exists!  really, this is beautiful music that everyone can appreciate!!!
B00004TRD8|4.0|The DVD features in here are amazing just like on ID4: Special Edition or The Matrix. We all know what this movie is about; Cyborg protecting kid from Shape changing Killer ETC. but never mind that, Get this loud and intense experience on DVD. it features three versions including the longer version, it's got Extras, audio commentaries, Trailers and everything you Sci-fi and action lovers would be dying to see. <br />Get this Disk and be home Happy ^-^.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old boy played by Jamie Bell.  On his way to a boxing lesson, he happened upon a ballet dancing class.  Soon he discovered that he was very good at ballet, and he then wanted to become a dancer despite his family's wishes.  This is a really touching and inspirational film about achieving dreams that will leave you cheering!<br />This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few considering that I'm only 14.  &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; is very similar to &quot;October Sky&quot;, which is another great movie.  (Even the kid's dad is a coal miner!)  But it is also very different in the way that it is much more complex and subtle.  I have noticed that because this is a British movie, it seems to be a lot more daring than most American movies, with a lot of things that Americans might consider extraneous.  But that's what I like about it; Every character is so well developed even if they have a very small role (e.g. Billy's supposedly gay friend).  These little aspects of these minor characters add a really nice touch to the already powerful story.  <br />Also, DON'T let the R-rating fool you.  THIS IS A FAMILY MOVIE.  This movie is NOT pornographic, or violent, or chock-full of coke-sniffing.  It just contains some language that little kids shouldn't use.  Even so, the profanity is used very maturely.  It is never gratuitous or unnecessary, it's just how these British people speak.  And the film never seems to glorify the use of such language.  <br />This film was WAY overlooked at the Oscars.  It's definitely better than &quot;Gladiator&quot;.  &quot;Gladiator&quot; may have cool combat actoin, but it's got a very straightforward plot which doesn't make you think.  I have NO IDEA why Jamie Bell wasn't nominated for his act.  He has a very auspicious start in his filom career with this movie!<br />If there's one thing to criticize about this movie, it's the fact that the dialogue is spoken with heavy British accents, making it hard to understand at times.  But that's not enough to keep me from saying that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Watch &quot;October Sky&quot; first, to give you an idea of how an American movie tells a dream, then watch &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; for a more sophisticated British idea.
B00000JMOJ|4.0|a Flawed film but hey! you gotta admitt that it's a lot of fun kind of movie.<br />Rent it if you a fan of &quot; 5th Element&quot;.
0920668364|1.0|I totally agree with the librarian who wrote about this book being a horror story. I think people are too caught up with the theme of a story of &quot;tables turned&quot; which is &quot;as a young child is taken care of BY his/her parent, so must the parent eventually be taken care OF.&quot;  However, an old &quot;granny&quot; as depicted in this book, is able to climb a ladder nightly to cradle her adult son - come one! get real here!  In addition, the illustrations are totally out of proportion and give a sense of oddity to the whole story. One final warning, be careful who you give this book to.  I gave it as a gift to my aging mother, who thought it was a nightmare! She didn't cry out of sentiment, but took offense and thought I was ready to spoon feed her and carry her up to her death bed!
0802130208|4.0|&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; gives the reader an interesting look into the life of Ignatius J. Reilly, the main character involved in a hilarious chain of events. Most readers will come to absolutely loathe Ignatius' mistreatment of his mother, pompous attitude towards blacks, homosexuals, and most humans for that matter, and his mannerisms toward his ventures in the working world. Set in the late 1950's in the seemingly blasé city of New Orleans, Louisiana, Ignatius, a disgustingly obese bringer of negativity, has a conflict with any other member of the human race, including Myrna Minkoff, an old beatnik girlfriend of Ignatius from his college days. Throughout the novel the two correspond via mail, describing the changes taking place in the country from their point of view, while hilariously exaggerating the events themselves. Ignatius also butts heads with his mother, who believes her son to be lazy and useless (and right she is indeed. The man is thirty!). Though understated, Ignatius has many insecurities, and though he has a college education, he has a conflict with himself and his correspondence with the social world. <br /> The charm and delight you'll find reading this novel is not within the hatred of Ignatius, but the underlying intrigues taking place amongst the antagonists, all of whom have come to know Ignatius in a rather unpleasant way. Patrolman Mancuso is forced to wear tacky costumes and work the dregs and ghettos of New Orleans when he attempts to arrest Ignatius in front of a local department store. The ball goes on rolling from there, creating many subplots that win the attention of the reader.<br />   Some people will find that they dislike the protagonist, which may keep them from reading further into the story. The author, John Kennedy Toole, does such a fine job creating memorable characters that you just may want to keep reading to see what lies ahead for the other characters, and how the vile Ignatius affects the paths of their lives. Using the Levy Pants company, Toole symbolizes the underpaid black workforce of America during the late 1950's, and uses New Orleans as a platform on which America is represented at the time. Though hilarious with dialogue, action, and personl musings, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; won my heart because it is a truly great novel with an ambiguous message of the American culture and its acceptance of unorthodox protocol.
B00004YKUY|3.0|Steve Augeri is a competent singer, even a very good singer, but he isn't Steve Perry.  I'd compare his singing style more to Dave Bickler of Survivor (&quot;Eye of the Tiger,&quot; Rocky III) than Steve Perry.  Steve Perry is probably the best rock/ballad singer in R&amp;R history...he has a certain timber to his voice and inflections that no one else has. While this album is worth buying, particularly considering the (c)rap and pablum currently getting air play, if you're expecting the second coming of Perry, you'll be somewhat disappointed.<br />Buy it if you like, but I'd spend my money on Grand Funk...Live! :-)
B000002JSR|4.0|I found this CD in the remainders bin locally and gave it a listen today. Of course, I'd already read the reviews here and, as a long-time Zep fan who prefers their early work, I thought this might be a bust. Not so! I actually like this album quite a lot! Although I'll be skipping Bonzo's Montreux (a little too MUCH drumming for my taste), the rest are rockers from the old school of Zep. Plant's voice is still superior and listen to Jimmy take his guitar to task. Bluesy rockin' stuff!
B000000H48|5.0|For those of you who don't know this, &quot;Conspiracy&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Them.&quot; If you have not heard &quot;Them,&quot; do so before you listen to &quot;Conspiracy.&quot; After hearing this record, I said to myself: &quot;Hendrix who??? King Diamond is FAR BETTER!!!&quot; For those of you who read my review on &quot;Them,&quot; you know that I gave it 4 stars. When I picked up &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; I wondered if the sequel would match the original. Within SECONDS that thought of mine was more than answered. The sequel was better! As wonderful as &quot;Them&quot; is, &quot;Conspiracy&quot; is more intense, more frightening, and more chilling.&quot; (One time I was listening to this record on a dark cold night; my father came up to my room; when he started to open the door, I jumped from my bed, grabbed a cross, and hid in the closet!) The lyrics in these tracks almost look like they were written by the great Christopher Marlowe himself. (Organized, intense, tightly unified, terrifying, fierce saracastic humor, and the occasional badly needed release of tension.) The music is no less than the perfect symphony for this masterpiece. I said this about &quot;Them,&quot; and I will say it about &quot;Conspiracy.&quot; This is far more frightening than any horror movie I have seen (with the exception of the Frank Langella's &quot;Dracula&quot; with Laurence Olivier as Abraham Von Helsing). King Diamond forgets the over blown effects and corny acting so he can deliver pure terror! CAUTION: If you are not used to this kind of music, read the lyrics in daylight before you listen to this record.
B000002GOZ|5.0|I've never cared too much for live albums as they lacked the vocal quality of studio recordings,and frankly I like to hear what they're saying.After catching the Unplugged show on MTV I bought this album.WOW!I've been a Badfan for 20 years and was impressed with the blues infused If Ya Wanna Be Bad-Ya gotta Be Good/Let's Make A Night To Remember making me think he should definitely cross over to Blues a little more often.Some older tracks have been sped up/slowed down to change the sound. A Little Love gives you some social issues to ponder. All in all,this is recommended to the fellow Badfan's out there. BADFAN TILL I DIE!
B00005ASOC|4.0|Gus Van Sant strikes again with this tale of a kid from the South Bronx who turns out to be an ingenious writer.  Robert Brown (in his first performance of his acting career) gives us a character to really like.  He is just there, doing his thing when he meets someone special.  A writer by the name of William Forrester (Sean Connery), who now lives in seclusion, inhabits an apartment near his home.  They become friends.  Connery helps Jamal (Brown) with his writing while he tells nothing to no one about him.  This is one of those movies that do not come around that often and should be watched to see its' true magic.  I reccommend this one to all who are in search of a good time.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This 2 disk DVD is THE example of what makes a VERY good DVD.  One of the most well done I've ever seen.  The movie's restoration was retained...  the color of the sand is correct, it's the original length before release!  The sound has been remixed and takes advantage of the 5 channels in 5.1 English.  An awesome effect during the echo scene in the canyon.  The extra features on the 2nd disk are great including the documentary... the paper insert from the original movie program is well done.  The interactive map viewable on a PC was also well done and it provides a good illustration of the superhuman efforts T.E. Lawrence pulled off on foot and camelback. Even the case with the cloth like feel is really nice.  The movie itself is a true masterpiece and the DVD with 5.1 DD is the best way to experience it outside of a 70mm theater.  Each scene is a work of art.  True the story may be a bit slow per todays standards, but you can see the story/movie's influence on many others such as Dune, the English Patient (some story elements come directly from the time period) and the first Star Wars movie.
B00005ASHM|5.0|You don't have to be a Beach Boy fan to appreciate this disc.  This CD should be in any music lover's library.  This triumph predates The Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; and had a profound effect on Paul McCartney.  Amazingly unappreciated at the time, it has been remastered and cleaned up to crisp perfection.  Get it now!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I won't get into how great the story and acting is in this movie. I'll just be repeating what everyone else states. I do want to emphasize the cinematography. It beat out any film this year. The use of light and color as well as sets and even physical types of everyone in the film (including extras) gives this film an incredible visual feel. Watch PBS documentaries of the era (minus the color experience),  and I think you will see to what I am refering. I have even sent for compact discs featuring Lonnie Johnston, Ry Cooder, the soundtrack to this film, etc. Like someone else more or less said, see this movie, and, when you feel stressed, think of &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; I have never looked so forward to purchasing a film.
B0000024TQ|3.0|Here's an album that reaches highs and lows so wildly opposing as to make any straight-thru listening difficult at best.<br />&quot;America&quot; is one of the true classics of the 1960s, as is &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; (I give some of the credit to Dustin Hoffman, but &quot;America,&quot; at least, could have stood on its own).  &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter,&quot; while not my cup of tea, shows off that Paul Simon world-weariness, for which he leans way too heavy on Dylan Thomas, that has always been big among 20-something pseudo-artists.  And I've always had a spot for &quot;At The Zoo,&quot; &quot;Fakin' It,&quot; and the haunting &quot;Bookends.&quot;<br />But the lows on this LP--&quot;Save The Life of My Child,&quot; &quot;Overs,&quot; &quot;Punky's Dilemma&quot; and, worst of all, &quot;Voices of The Old People,&quot; are just dreck.  Simon was always too willing to go cutesy--I sight &quot;Feelin' Groovy,&quot; quite possibly the worst post-Beatles hit on the pop charts--and the self-satisfaction on this LP is too hard to stomach. <br />Simon &amp; Garfunkel made some great, great records, but LPs were decidedly NOT their forum.  They were a greatest hits package waiting to happen.
6305657947|1.0|First, what ever happened to the four Romanians that Crown presumably hired to create the diversion?  Second, the police are portrayed as a bunch of idiots who do nothing but sit around and drink coffee.  Third, does anyone really believe that a female insurance investigator is goint to have all of the stats on a Sikorsky helicopter right on the top of her head?  Fourth, the police detective unrealistically lets Russo excape with Crown because he really doesn't give a damn about a stolen Monet? Fifth, does anyone really believe that an insurance investigator is going to seize evidence illegally?  Sixth, does anyone really believe that a real-life Thomas Crown would throw everything away to run away with this?? He wouldn't even do it for a Zeta-Jones, who would be much more compelling.  Don't spend the money!
B000002GVZ|4.0|Carly Simon was famous before her songs were done to death in cracker commercials and soundtracks to chick flicks.  She was, in fact, tough as nails on pop, top-40 radio.  White suburbia's Laura Nyro, if you will.<br />If you think you aren't familiar with her best stuff, check out the samples here.  You'll recognize most of them.  Along with Carol King, Simon dominated radio play for a couple of years, putting out a series of sparkling piano-based singles that told stories from a side of the coin pop hadn't heard in a while.  <br />She could do anything for a while.  I mean, who would have said &quot;Mockingbird&quot; would be a hit?<br />While I think this is a great album--the first 6 titles are all minor classics of American pop--it's &quot;You're So Vain&quot; that will always make Carly Simons reputation.<br />What a perfect, perfect single.  Mixed like a Lennon record, with those throaty Carly vocals and a nasty lyric (&quot;You gave away the things you loved and one of them was me,&quot;) that sent everybody on edge when it was released.  For a time, there was a real debate about the focus of the title: Warren Beatty? James Taylor? Mick Jagger?  I think the final consensus was Beatty; Jagger sings backing vocals on the track.<br />That's how big she was: Mick Jagger was a hired backup singer on her records.<br />&quot;You're So Vain&quot; sits in my alltime top-10, and the rest of this album is a study in Pop.  Get it.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Look, I don't know much of anything about music.  Actually, I know nothing.  I just go out to a store, buy a CD, listen to it, and if I don't like it, I don't listen to it anymore.  This CD is one of those that I liked a lot, and now even six months later, I still listen to it like I got it yesterday.  It sounds nothing like the other Beach Boys stuff.  Most of their other stuff is all upbeat, you know, and I love that too...  But this is nice and calming and soothing.  And the really funny part is that I have a set of CDs tht I call my fall asleep CDs.  I can't fall asleep without music, so I have a set set of CDs that I keep out so I can pop 'em in as I sleep.  Most of the music that I fall asleep to is sort of loud like Green Day, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Incubus, etc.  If I can't fall aslep to that, I pop Pet Sounds in, and I'm out by the third song.  I love it.
B000001FSR|3.0|This is one creepy album.<br />On previous records, Waits toyed around with homeless, slightly crazy characters.  Here, Frank's visions of grandeur fall flat on their face and he ends up, at least by my reading, a drunk on the streets.  There is madness, real madness, running through this record.  <br />To coin a scientific phrase, this record gives me the willies.<br />Not to say there aren't good songs here.  Most of them are excellent.  But, with the exception of the stunning &quot;Yesterday Is Here,&quot; &quot;Cold Cold Ground,&quot; and &quot;Train Song,&quot; they are painfully hard to listen to.  Makes you feel like you're stuck in a haunted house.<br />&quot;The bats are in the belfry, the dew is on the moor...where are the arms that held me and pledged to love before?&quot;  That is the resolution here, the final sentiment of the closing the tune.  &quot;You're innocent when you dream&quot; doesn't sound hopefull by the end of FRANK'S WILD YEARS, it is a defeated voice rationalizing past mistakes.<br />This isn't the best Tom Waits but, if you can fight off the ghosts, it's still a very good LP.
1576461823|5.0|this one is a thriller not that much of suspense but still it forces you not to give it up before finishing it.
0385470819|4.0|A Time to Kill, written by John Grisham, is a fast-pace thriller about a lawyer named Jake Brigance.  Jake inherits a law firm from an older lawyer who was disbarred.  The firm is in a small rural place called Ford County.  The time period is the 1980's.  Grisham jumps right in at the beginning to describe the crime. Jake goes to work on the biggest case in the history of the town.   If he wins he will become rich and famous as a lawyer.  Two white men named Billy Ray Cobb and Pete Willard were out in the woods drinking and raped a little black girl named Tonya Hailey.  They raped her and beat her, then left her in a ditch.  When they got to the hostpital, they realized that she was badly hurt  Cobb and Willard went to court, they were caught!  They got a trial date and were denied bail.  Immediatly following the trial Carl Lee Hailey, Tonya's father, ran into the room and shot the two men who had raped his daughter.  Jake is hired to defend Carl Lee. Grisham uses flashbacks right after the killings to tell what the rapicsts were doing before they were murdered, and also to portray the involvement of the KKK.  In this novel Grisham is trying to teach that two wrongs don't make a right, no matter how bad the first wrong makes you fell or haw mad you get about it. This book is the best novel I have ever read.  I will continue to read works written by John Grisham.
B00000JNO2|5.0|I once read an interview with Gary Rossington and he felt Gimmie Back My Bullets was Skynrds worst effort.  I would have to disagree.  Sure &quot;Pronounced,&quot;Second Helping&quot;,Street Survivors are classic lps.I think Bullets captures the true nature of this band.u can feel Ronnie Van Zant struggling to hold on to his values during a time when the band was in flux with Ed King leaving the burnout of the road and the frustraion of dealing with &quot;pencil pushers.&quot;  This is the album I love to listen to when I'm pissed off about something and I think Ronnie and the boys were pretty ornry when they recorded it.  The picture on the front cover shows how dishevled and wore out the band was from the &quot;Torture Tours&quot; and all the vices that occur when touring.  This is a great album.  I only wish they would have put the acoustic version of &quot;All I can do is Write&quot;  on the reissue.  I am thinking of having that song played at my funeral even though I'm a Yankee.  Buy this disc and all the Skynyrd music you can.
B000002O51|5.0|After releasing Don't Look Back in 1978, Boston took eight years to release its follow-up, Third Stage.  I don't know how it took eight years to make this record as it sounds like their first two, but that's a good thing.  The album is full of major power chords, big hooks and roof raising vocals.  The album kicks off with the power ballad &quot;Amanda&quot;.  The song is a perfect a power ballad that was ever released and Brad Delp gives a tremendous vocal performance.  The band was rewarded with their one and only number one song.  &quot;We're Ready&quot; was another top ten hit and is a driving rocker.  &quot;The Launch&quot; is another chance for Tom Scholz to show off his MIT degree as it is amalgamation of guitars that produces a symphonic sound.  &quot;Cool The Engines&quot; is a great song and &quot;Cant'cha Say You Believe In Me/I Still Love You&quot; is an epic song.  Third Stage showed that Boston still could be a force on the charts even after an eight year disappearance as the album hit number one in late 1986.
0783226063|1.0|This movie is terrible on so many levels it is hard to do it justice here.  The acting is terrible.  The story is terrible.  The special effects are terrible.  Fans of the book will hate it because it completely departs from the book.  People who do not know the book will hate it because only someone who has read the book can even fathom watching it in the first place.<br />Anyone who sees depth and meaning in this movie is intellectually masturbating.  Save your money.  Do not buy this DVD.  Buy the Sci-Fi Mini-Series Version.  I can only hope this review saves at least one person the pain of seeing this rendition of Dune.
B0000025C0|4.0|Don't Look Back was the follow up to what was at the time the biggest selling debut album in history.  Boston's self titled debut was filled with arena rock anthems that featured a wall of guitars that inspired air guitarists everywhere.  Don't Look Back follows that winning formula.  The album doesn't contain the number of classics that the debut does, but it still pretty darn good.  The title track is barrage of guitars that contains an explosive vocal from Brad Delp.  &quot;The Journey&quot; shows off Tom Scholz's studio wizardry.  &quot;A Man I'll Never Be&quot; finds the band treading into ballad territory to good results.  &quot;Feelin' Satisfied&quot; is a burner while &quot;Party&quot; is just that a party of guitars.  If you like guitars and lots of them, then this album will be to your liking.  Alot of people liked this album as it became the band's first number one album in late 1978.
B00005B58Y|5.0|Kind of Blue was aptly named and so was this masterpiece! I just added the above adjectives to help describe the sheer passion presented by these musicians.
B000002JPA|5.0|I was turned on to this group by friends in College.  The best word I can think of to describe them is Amazing.
6300183971|4.0|This is an epic movie, deep, complex, thrilling, and enjoyable. I watched the whole thing from beginning to end in one sitting, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.<br />Based on the reputation of the book as a very complex tale of intrigue and struggle, I knew a four-hour movie just wasn't going to do the book justice. But the trade off is that most of the scenes are rich with story info just asking for analysis and synthesis.<br />As would be expected of an epic saga about a pan-galactic human civilization, there is an abundance of cultures. The nuances that you encounter in the movie fit in perfectly -- details are important. Also, many of the personalities have strange accents and place emphasis on odd syllables. Not only do they do this well and believably, but it adds a lot of realism to the whole production.<br />The special effects are sometimes lacking. What can you expect from a four hour movie that is supposed to look like it was all shot in a desert? But for the scenes that count, the special effects are breathtaking, and well worth the movie alone.<br />Towards the end of the series the story kind of breaks down. Too much is going on, and much of it is mystical, having to do with the effects of &quot;the Spice&quot; on certain individuals. But overall it is still an excellent movie.

B00005067B|5.0|Hi, I bought the box yesterday in a shop in Milan. I've been waiting for it since December. Now it's mine!. I think this is a funny and wonderful black and green box that contains a black embroidered t-shirt with the logo A.T.Y.C.L.B, a golden pin, a mouse pad and the limited version of A.T.Y.C.L.B. cd! If you are a collector and you have the money to buy it, you'd be better go and run worldwide to find it. As soon as possible 'cause  it's a limited issue of 1000. Once you've got it, you can go proud of it and one day ... you can tell your son: 'Hey son, you're a lucky boy. This box is for you. U2 are the best rock band ever in the world and you've got something special of them!. Enjoy U2!'. Ciao.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|What happened? Did I miss something? When did the Offspring become a pop-rock band? And after such albums as Smash, one of my all-time favorite albums.I liked that one because it was widely appealing to alternative fans of all sorts. Melodic, yet heavy. This one sounds just watered down. The music is weaker, and the lyrics lack meaning.Except &quot;The Kids Aren't All Right&quot; That song is true Offspring, not watered down pop. Please,do yourself a favor and pick up &quot;Smash&quot;. I assure you that you won't be disappointed.
6304936362|5.0|This movie describes the B-17 missions down to the bullets. It gives a vivid and real description of what being in the 8th Air Force was like.I recomend this movie to anyone and everyone who is interested in WWII. This movie is awesome.
B00000IPAX|1.0|I'm not entirely sure why this is called punk. The music certainly doesn't show it. And the lyrics! Don't even get me started!! The guitar and bass sound far too poppy, but the drumming isn't terrible. In fact, their drummer has quite a bit of talent. He should form another band. Punk is bands like NOFX,Pennywise,Rancid and old Offspring( new 'Spring{Americana,Conspiracy of One}sucks).In fact, go buy &quot;Smash&quot; by the aforementioned Offspring. And while you're at it, check out early Silverchair and anything by the great Nirvana. Those bands were punk in the public eye that WEREN'T poppy or sell-outs.Avoid these guys like the plague.
B00000ICD9|5.0|My husband and I rented this movie thinking it would be all right, but probably not wonderful. A few hours later, we were both sobbing in each others' arms, having gone through one of the most amazing journeys on film I've ever experienced. If you've ever had a soul mate, this movie is something you must see. If you are a thinking person, this will be a breath of air in a creatively stifled world. If you would prefer to watch another re-run of &quot;Married With Children&quot; or you preferred Robin Williams when he did that good ol' &quot;Mork and Mindy&quot; (and you don't quite get that weird art stuff he's doing) then don't even think about watching this movie, because you don't deserve it. It is a jewel.
078322608X|5.0|If you only want to watch movies where everything is straight-forward, films where you are never called upon to really think, then by all means, this movie is NOT for you.  If, on the other hand, you are inclined to view ambitious projects that test your imagination, then this film should be on your wish list.<br />The film is basically a Grecian tragedy that is transposed into the medium of the science fiction genre.  It centers around the concepts of fate and pre-determination, using the instruments of sci-fi lore instead of the seers and prophecies of Greek mythology.  The allusion to Cassandra  (daughter of Priam &amp; Hecuba [king &amp; queen of Troy], condemned by Apollo for betraying her promises to him) is not only appropriate, but utterly delicious.  This is a film for classical scholars and aficionados of mythology if there ever was one.<br />The production also features an all-star cast.  Bruce Willis is superb in what is quite an out-of-the-ordinary role for him.  Madeline Stowe, as always, is top-knotch.  Brad Pitt is wonderful as a crazy man, delivering perhaps the finest performance of his career.  To round things out, we get to enjoy Christopher Plummer as an eccentric scientist.<br />To anyone who enjoys Grecian tragedy and / or post-modern thought, this film is a must see.  It ends up being the perfect marriage of the two genres.  Not to be missed.

B000050FEN|5.0|In this movie, Morgan Freeman plays a police officer (William Somerset) who is well-read (whoa!!).  Let me repeat that:  Morgan Freeman's character can tell the difference between the writings of Hesiod and the plays of Racine.  That his character is erudite is reason enough to rent this movie, regardless of whether or not you like thriller-type flicks.<br />Brad Pitt is excellent as Freeman's ignoramous partner, David Mills.  The plot has the two of them attempting to apprehend a felon who is every bit as learned as  detective Somerset.  Due to this, the movie is able to do what few other movies have ever done;  it delves into the morose Dantesque overtones of sin and punishment.  For a brief introduction to the works of Dante, visit this website:<br />[...]<br />Besides Dante Alighieri, the film also contains allusions to John Milton and Earnest Hemingway, among others.<br />Besides the intellectual apparatus of the movie, it is also worth seeing plotwise as well.  A great film, especially for lovers of literature.
B00003CXPD|3.0|I enjoyed the story a great deal. However, the sound in the DVD version is really bad.  I kept having to turn the volume way up to hear the dialogue and turn it way down for the louder passages.  I would like for your sound analyst to check this out.
B00003CWL6|5.0|If this movie is to be labeled as an &quot;experimental movie,&quot; then it is a successful experiment.  When I first saw it in the theatre, I had no idea what to expect.  To my surprise and delight, I found a truly deep and stimulating film;  something that is almost bereft in Hollywood productions these days.<br />The movie centers around the life of one Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey.  This is a different sort of role for the usual masculine Spacey, and he turns in an Academy Award calibre performance.  The story details the plight of Burnham as he approaches middle age and the dreaded &quot;mid-life crisis.&quot;  His marriage no longer holds any passion, his daughter feels nothing but apathy towards him, and his employer feels that he must write up a report to &quot;justify his existence&quot; as the company he works for is ready to downsize (if that's not a buzzword these days for corporations, I don't know what is).<br />There is a haunting nostalgia and foreboding which saturates this movie as few I've ever seen.  Burnham's meditation on his own death is utterly fascinating.  The tale distinctively brings to mind the passage &quot;Death By Water&quot; from T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Wasteland&quot;:<br />Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,<br />Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss.<br />  A current under sea<br />Picked his bones in whispers.  As he rose and fell<br />He passed the stages of his age and youth<br />Entering the whirlpool.<br />  Gentile or Jew<br />O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,<br />Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as<br />you.  (312-322)<br />Through all this, Spacey's character dreams of reclaiming lost youth &amp; the vigour for life that he once held.  There are also Faulkneresque overtones straight out of &quot;The Sound And The Fury&quot; as Burnham's daughter &amp; her boyfriend confront the awakening of their sexuality and the concept of death simultaneously.<br />This is a tremendous effort of film-making, and I just wish Hollywood would take more chances on cerebral projects such as this one, instead of sticking to the safe, redundant &quot;tried &amp; true&quot; formulae movies for which they are so well known.  Whether my wish comes true or not (it probably won't), this is a fantastic post-modern film to be enjoyed by all.he concept of death simultaneously.<br />This is a tremendous effort of film-making, and I just wish Hollywood would take more chances on cerebral projects such as this one, instead of sticking to the safe, redundant &quot;tried &amp; true&quot; formulae movies for which they are so well known.

B000002ADT|5.0|...and possibly the greatest album ever recorded.  The master of modern jazz, Miles Davis, rocked the music world with this smooth CD of beauty and glory.  Each song takes a unique style, a special beat, and a sort of rhythm that leaves me humming for hours after I've heard it.  Easily the best album in my music collection, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; proves that jazz is alive and well, and that it will live on.  Davis pours his heart and soul into his music, and the music will lift even the most downtrodden of spirits.  Truly inspiring in all regards, this album is a MUST for all Davis lovers, for all jazz lovers, and certainly for all music lovers.

B00005B6C9|5.0|I'm 22 and have been a Bee Gees fan for years. This is one of their best albums yet. It is right up there with Still Waters. There's a good mix of all kinds of sounds from a rock sound to some nice good love songs. This is a great album and it is worth buying. I just bought it today when it came out and have been listening to it all day. A must album for any Gibb fan.
1570428654|5.0|As a close follower of David's work, I was thrilled to hear he had another tape out.  I have listened to all of his others and never tire of his humor.  This tape is centered more around David and his partner, Hugh, and their lives in New York and Paris.  I prefer the stories about his family, but these are satisfying as well.  Highly recommend....

The road trip is long and dumb with a little hurmoers Ques in there.  One being Tom Greens name in the movie is BARRY MANOLOW. lol damn it wont let me write no more  Well to the next time this MARk

B00000ILDE|5.0|When ALIENS was released in 1986 the studio made James Cameron cut over 17 minutes of film because they felt it was too long. Still the released film was over two hours, but audiences didn't seem to mind.  The film was branded an instant classic, setting a new standard for sci-fi, horror and action movies... all at the same time.  It even earned Sigourney Weaver (returning to her role as Lt. Ellen Ripley) a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination.  ALIENS proved that a sequel can live up to, if not surpass the vision of the original. It has been imitated dozens of times, but is has never been topped. <br />Ripley awakens 57 years after A L I EN, only to find out that no one believes her story about a monster that gestates inside of humans, killing it's host (rather violently) at it's birth, grows very fast, has acid for blood and is pretty much an \\"unkillable\\" killing machine.  So they fire her and threaten to sue her for destroying the Nostromo (the company's ship in part 1).  She's forced to live in a run down apartment building and gets a job working on the cargo docks because no one else will hire her...However, the company did send out some colonists to check out her story. The colonists are unaware that for the past 20 years they've been sharing the same planet with Ripley's monsters. <br /> That's the setup before all hell literally breaks loose. <br />James Cameron masterfully choreographs a decent into the bowels of a planet taken over by a demon monster and her brood (and there are many of them in this one).  This DVD edition includes the 17 minutes of cut footage, which adds tremendously to the narrative, filling in some rather irritating gaps that were left in the theatrical version.  Ripley is given a past, making her relationship with the little girl Newt more understandable. You actually see how the aliens took over the colony on LV-426.  So when the marines arrive at the colony, you FEEL the loss.   The movie is an emotional roller coaster ride and at the same time, a well-crafted nightmare.  The final 45 minutes alone will have anyone literally sitting on the edge of their seats.  Followed in 1992 by a somewhat mellower sequel, ALIEN 3.
6302641888|5.0|To really comment on a film like Persona there would first have to be written full, a dictionary of completely new words and terms.  Verbal language simply cannot describe the emotional piano Persona plays.  Along with 2001: A Space odyssey, it is the single most disturbing and mind opening film I have ever seen.      While in the middle of performing the last act of Electra, Elizabeth Vogler suddenly freezes, and from then on ceases to speak.  She is in perfect health both mentally and physically, but for reasons unknown has simply retreated into herself.  Sister Alma, a young nurse, is sent to look after her.  They go together to a small remote Island, where Alma attempts to nurture her out of her silent facade.  At first, due to her silence, Alma cares for Elizabeth like an oversized doll.  But then, with the opportunity of real conversation, Elizabeth becomes to her an empty vessel into which she spills her soul.  And Elizabeth, hollow, becomes a sort of vampire, constantly taking in Alma, but at the same time giving herself up as well.  Nestled together, without the interferences of the world, their personas begin to mesh, as they become the two sides of a single personality, one soul living amongst two bodies.  However, as a human body warns off a foreign intruder, the personas of Elizabeth and Alma become allergic to each other, engaging in a fierce battle for identity.    Throughout, as if testing his own skills as a seducer, Bergman tries to remind his audience that it is just a movie they are watching, not experiencing.  But true to his form it becomes of no use... Persona is an experience.  Alluring, compelling, mind opening, and disturbing, Persona is all of these things.  It is a film that works on a multitude of complex levels.      In a sexual sense, not a stitch of clothing is removed, and yet the film permeates with eroticism.  It is on many stages completely surreal, but you don't realize that.  You don't realize anything... you simply experience.And then afterwards you sit in awe, trying to recall what has just gone on.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Contrary to popular belief (probably by those who have never actually seen this movie), Pitch Black bares little if any resemblance to ALIEN or any of it's sequels.  This movie gets by completely on it's own merits.  Not only is this movie intensely suspenseful and very scary (mostly by what you hear and don't see).  Not only does it have incredible special effects galore and original (and extremely vicious) monsters, but it has character development.  Surprisingly, the development of these characters is totally unpredictable and a little bit shocking.  So is the end of this movie.  You don't know whom to route for... or who to hate, but you eventually figure it out.  In most movies of this genre, you know how the movie will end as soon as the opening credits have stopped rolling.  This movie was a pleasant surprise in that respect. It was also an unexpected emotional trip and a hard lesson in salvation and ultimate redemption as well.

B00004RE7C|5.0|When everyone says that all the Star Trek films with odd numbers are duds, they must've forgotten about Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.  Although the title may be dumb (if you saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, then you are well aware of exactly \\"where\\" Spock is), this film is just about equal to The Wrath of Kahn.  Part III picks up exactly where part II left off, with everyone saddened by the death of Spock. The Genesis Project is now very controversial because it is known throughout the galaxy as a very powerful weapon.  Enter the Klingons, led by Christopher Lloyd (in a role that had to have been tailor-made for him).  He battles Kirk for the Genesis Project...and so on.  <br />This movie's emphasis on the theme of friendship and sacrifice above all else makes it a winner in the hearts of Trekkers, or anyone with feelings for that matter.  The rescue of Spock and the aforementioned \\"sacrifices\\" are just as dramatic and haunting as Spock's demise was in part II (there are two really big shockers in this sequel).  The only real weak link in this movie was the replacement of Kirsty Alley by Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik.  Alley's Saavik in The Wrath of Khan was played surprisingly with a lot of emotion, and that's what made her character likable.  Curtis plays her as being very dry and too \\"logical,\\" which given who she was in part II, makes no sense. Part III was cleverly directed by Leonard Nimoy who also directed part IV: The Voyage Home.
B000002J0P|5.0|With their heavy resumes (Stills ex-Buffalo Springfield, Crosby ex-Bryds, and Nash ex-Hollies), this trio came together in 1969 to release this incredibly well-crafted album. The songs here showcase each member's honed songwriting talent and fine instrumentation skills, particularly Stills' mastery of the guitar and bass. The vocal blend and harmonies that would become their trademark is in full force on this album. Stills' &quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes&quot; is a classic, as are &quot;Helplessly Hoping&quot; and Crosby's &quot;Guinnevere.&quot; &quot;You Don't Have to Cry&quot; is a great track, one of my favorites. As Crosby once said, Nash's addition to the songs he and Stills were working on was &quot;the rightest thing I ever heard.&quot; It still is. This cd is the best!
0385474547|2.0|I'm sure that if i hadn't had to write a paper, and analyze every word in the story, i would have been ok with this book. Unfortunately i was forced to did deeper into a book which did not suite my interests and i came to the conclusion that the book had nothing intellectually stimulating to offer and it was a generally boring book. If you think you can make it through, or if this genre interests you, by all means read it....but if you have any doubts, dont analyze every word, it ruins the fun.
0060278242|5.0|Everyone else has seemed to cover the reviews and such for this book, complained about the whinning Prince Sameth..etc,etc. I have absoulutley no complaints, I loved this book, it comparest to none. Up until I read &quot;Sabriel&quot; my favorite trilogy was the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; set by Philip Pullman, and this clearly surpassed that. I cannot wait until the release of &quot;Abhorsen&quot; and I congratulate Garth Nix on his wonderful novel!
B00005B6C9|4.0|The Bee Gees have done it again. 'This is Where I Came In' is full of little gems, sure to become fan favorites. What is missing is the overpowering falsettos of previous albums. What this album does have is beautiful music and harmonies, from the title track to the heart tugging 'Sacred Trust'. This is a must have for any Gibb fan. The tune 'Wedding Day' is sure to become a wedding favorite. (I used it in my August Wedding for the first dance) 'Man in the Middle' has Maurice Gibb's smooth voice singing about a position he knows all to well. Over all this Album is very good. A definate must have. Full of both ballads and upbeat tunes.
6300180468|4.0|This 7th of the most influential internatioanl music competition was quite enjoyable, stimulating, for sure! You will see how Sergei Stadler did almost bit Viktoria Mullova, the other violin virtuoso, by dispaying his philosophcally mature contemplation with high-qualitied skills on Tchaikovski Violin concerto No.1. Most of all, you wouldn't pay through your nose for this VHS by merely being amazed with the 2nd winner, Vladimir Ovchinnikov's Tchaikovski Piano concerto No.1. It was definitely powerful and technical playing with graceful manner so that the great Rachmaninoff 3rd Piano concerto by Peter Donohoe(shared 2nd prize)wasn't even my primary concern!  On a bit disappointing account, for such a international competition all over the world, there was not a single performing-scene of 2nd prize winner for Violin and 3rd for piano from Japan. Given that for instance Tomoko Kato's playing Ravel made the laureat just a violin's embodiment, it was ahamed to unable to see some other great works. By and large, however, it is truly worth getting it in order to at least feel how herculean efforts the classical musicians are demanded to make, never as a &quot;mickeymouse guy&quot;.
B00003CXRP|1.0|I am sorry, but those who thought that Tom Hanks should have won an oscar or other such nonsense need to see more films.  His performance, most especially in the middle portion, was one-dimensional.  The beginning was mildly entertaining, highly cliched and predictable.  Tom shouts a lot and is generally obnoxious and insensitive.  Then he ends up on the island and shouts some more.  Hanks' acting technique: if I shout loud and often enough and lose weight, I'm a great actor.  We were supposed to see despair, hope, weariness, introspection, anger, frustration and sorrow.  What we got was a lot of crazed shouting.  Loud and grating, crazed shouting.  If you take out the middle portion of this movie, you have a very unoriginal, short mildly entertaining mainstream movie - with the middle, it just plain stinks.
B00005B6C9|5.0|WOW!!!!!!  I must say I am thrilled about this new release by one of the most legendary music groups!  This new cd by THE BEE GEES is stellar!!!  I am very picky with my music but every track on this album is excellent!  From the opening chorus of THIE IS WHERE I CAME IN to the closing track, VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS, this cd is so great!  Anyone who enjoys this group MUST RUN OUT and buy this album!  You will enjoy it!  Plus, if you purchase it at certain stores, there is a bonus live cd with 3 songs....I'VE GOT TO GET A MESSAGE TO YOU, RUN TO ME, and TOO MUCH HEAVEN!!!  Enjoy this cd and THIS IS WHERE I CAME IN!
B00000AOSL|4.0|If blindingly fast guitar 70's style is to your liking, this is the cd for you.&quot;Back on the Streets&quot; begins with a good solid rocker title track and takes off from there on a journey through several musical styles that Gary manages to master one and all.&quot;Don't Believe A Word&quot; is a great bluesy tune more in common with the material he is now best known for.Three songs in the middle find Gary tackling jazz fusion stuff very remeniscent of the Jeff Beck / Jan Hammer collaborations of the same time period. You might even think of Al DiMeola circa &quot;Elegant Gypsy&quot;.&quot;Song For Donna&quot; has some sweet mellow tones and worth the price of admission alone is the original studio version of &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot; with lead vocals by Phil Lynott with Gary doing backup vox.Absolutely fantastic! This cd is a must have for completists and anyone interested in the evolution of one of the best guitarists of this or any other era.I would have given the disc 5 stars except for the inclusion of the song &quot;Fanatical Fascists&quot;, which is probably the worst song Gary Moore has associated himself with.( Italian mustaches?)Otherwise a superb recording.

0789723107|4.0|The first thing I thought when considering whether to purchase this book was, &quot;Wow. Could it really be worth ... in soft-cover?&quot; Did I buy it? Well, sure--otherwise I wouldn't be writing this review. And the thing that made me finally decide to purchase the book was the title, &quot;Don't Make Me Think.&quot; In a world that values simplicity and ease of use, those are words to live by.<br />Designers looking for some real nuts and bolts technical information probably won't get much from this book. Actually, tech talk is not what it's about. &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; is a friendly, accessible treatise on the principles of Web usability--how to keep users at your site longer by giving them the most uncomplicated experience possible. Will it tell you how to implement your latest Flash creation? Nah. But it will help you discover ways to make your site more &quot;user friendly,&quot; and usability is an important issue in building a site that attracts--and most of all, KEEPS--visitors.<br />I got two chapters into this book and my head was already churning with ways to make my site easier to use and understand, and therefore more &quot;sticky.&quot; By chapter three, I'd begun a total redesign of my website, and continued working until 3 a.m. (My advice? Don't read this book unless you're willing to stay up late.) A month later, when all was said and done, I had built a better site and my stats showed that instead of the average 6 pages viewed per visit I had been experiencing previously, the site was now averaging double that with 12. All in all, not bad results for a ... investment.<br />&quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; does wander off on a few tangents that have more to do with design and less to do with usability or the psychology behind what makes visitors keep on clickin', and the fact that it wanders from its chosen topic makes it slightly less useful. Still, if finding ways to improve your website visitor's experience is one of your goals, you'llenjoy &quot;Don't Make Me Think.&quot;
B000031XCR|5.0|This is a fabulous cd.  It highlights the most popular songs of Celine's career in the U.S.  The album spans over ten years, combining her best work at various stages of her life.  Nine songs have been previously released, which include such favorites as &quot;All By Myself&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, and many others.  It also includes seven new songs which have become quite popular, such as &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot;, &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot;, &quot;All the Way&quot;, and Celine's version of &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; as heard on Celine's television special in 1999. I would definitely recommend this cd to major Celine fans as well as moderate ones.  If you only buy one Celine cd, this should be it.  All of your favorites plus seven amazing new songs, commemorating Celine's incredible career thus far.  I guarantee you will love this cd!
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is the absolute best &quot;Superman&quot; film of all time because you get to see how it all started. You get to see Superman's father, Jor-El (played by an astonishing Marlon Brando), and you also get to see how his earlier life had been before he wore the red cape and blue. And no one could ask for a better Superman than Christopher Reeve. Reeve just blows the competition out of the water as the Man of Steel. Also, &quot;Superman&quot; has some comic relief from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Ned Beatty as his bumbling sidekick, Otis. But also, this film has a soft side when Superman falls for Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). This is the ultimate Superman movie for years to come, with action, romance, laughs, and a great storyline, this movie has it all. And the top-notch directing from Richard Donner (before &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;) has never been better. Also the special features on the DVD are outstanding!! Especially the screen tests, trailers, and the deleted scenes. I urge anyone out there to OWN THIS FILM, whether it's on DVD or VHS, own it! Like I said, this IS the best Superman film to date, there will be no other film like this.
6300263673|5.0|Since this movie first came out to now, 2001, it's been my favorite of all time!  Baby and Johnny represent the classic love story:  girl who starts out as innocent/shy type meets jerky boy who ends up showing his sensitive side and they fall head over heals for each other.  All the while, Baby has to learn how to dance to help out Johnny's partner. The best scene in the whole movie is at the very end when Johnny comes back to have the last dance of the season with Baby as his partner. Those two weeks were part of a summer that changed both their lives forever.  Quotable Quote:  &quot;Nobody puts Baby in a corner.&quot;
B000001EHS|5.0|Greatest Hits types of albums are always a gamble. However when a group is as timeless as Def Leppard, with their hard driving beats, and catchy lyrics, a greatest hits cd is not as much of a gamble. From the first drumbeats of Pour Some Sugar on Me, to the melodic Two Steps Behind, to the driving Rocket, to the lesser known When Love and Hate Collide, all the way through the finishing Bringin' on the Heartbreak..this CD Rocks...hard.  It's everything that Def Leppard was during that decade long span from 1985 through 1995. Any true blue Def Leppard fan is singing along with this CD from beginning to end. And for the more casual Def Leppard fan, it's got a majority of tracks that you'd be familiar with and could sing along with, while the other tracks draw your attention from being pure Def Leppard material.  If you missed out on getting the individual CD's from Hysteria through Slang..you've got 'The Best Of' right here on this CD. That in and of itself is reason enough to buy it.
B000050FEN|5.0|Everyone has heard of the seven deadly sins, but most people can't name all of them.  Most people forget a couple, but after seeing this movie I do not think I will ever forget any one of them.  The movie is powerful and well-acted by Morgan Freeman, and (surprisingly) Brad Pitt.  The premise alone is ingenious, maybe, even the best concept for a thriller in a long time.  I have a feeling the screenwriter, Kevin Walker, will be a high commodity for a long time.<br />What is the premise? Well, it's about an extreme righteous killer named Jon Doe (played by the ever talented Kevin Spacey) being tracked down by two detectives, the soon-to-be-retired Somersett (freeman), and the new kid, Sims (Pitt).  Although we never see the deaths take place, we do see the aftermath which is very unsettling and let's your mind wander on how it all took place, the torture Jon Doe put them through.  When Jon Doe is told that he is killing innocent people he responds, &quot;innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?&quot; then says why those people deserved there death sentence, each linked to one of the deadly sins, of course.  Then when you think the movie is unsettling enough, the ending will push you over the edge.  GRADE: A
B000001A9P|5.0|From the opening notes of Dancing to the Rhythm, to the closing notes of Another Star, you get the full live experience of the great Stevie Wonder. All of his popular songs from a majority of his career are on this collection. There's not a single song to skip past in this two disc set. I almost feel like I was at a concert at the moment, every time I listen to the CD. If you listen to Stevie Wonder at all, you definitely need to have this CD. It's perhaps the pinnacle of his recordings, and definitely one of the best live CD's I have in my collection of music.
B00005AUBA|5.0|there has always been something about mogwai.  i can distinctly remember the day i bought my first mogwai disc (young team), popping it into my car, and being blown away.  soon after, one by one, i purchased the mogwai discography.  and there hasn't been any purchases i would take back.  i enjoyed all their releases and i respected that they proved with each album that they refused to stay the same.  they were a great example of how a band should evolve.<br />so you could say i had incredibly high hopes for &quot;rock action&quot;.  i wanted another great album that showed yet more progress.  there hadn't been too many &quot;great&quot; albums released yet in 2001 so i set even higher expectations for it.<br />and this album exceeded every single expectation.<br />from the opening hum of &quot;sine wave&quot; to the final guitar strumming on &quot;secret pint&quot;, this album is pure musical bliss.  never before has there been a mogwai album that sounded so varied, yet so focused.  they incorporate more electronic elements into the mix on some tracks, and the accoustic guitar line on &quot;dial:  revenge&quot; is beautiful (as are the guest vocals from gruff rhys from the super furry animals).  and speaking of vocals, there are more on this album than previous releases.  this actually made it harder for me to get into at first, but now after more listens i appreciate it so much more, as they used them very tastefully and never overdo it.<br />&quot;rock action&quot; has no spots that lag, and some of the songs are catchy even...but still beg you to listen to them over and over.  this is an album that will stand up to repeated listening (as all mogwai albums do) and should become an important part of your music collection as there is not much that sounds like it.<br />this album does not sound like come on die young.  if you're expecting them to revert to the sound on young team, think again.  but if you are expecting them to progress again and make more great music, buy this album, as you will not be disappointed in the least.<br />and if you've never heard mogwai, this would be a great starting point, as it is probably the most accessible for untrained ears.
B000001DVD|5.0|High N' Dry is far more raw than the more popular Def Leppard releases that followed, but for anyone that is a true blue Def Lep fan, this CD fits right into the collection without skipping a beat. The beats are harder driving, the guitars harsher, and Joe Elliott just sounds a lot more raw. This CD was their first effort with Mutt Lange (the producer that oversaw all their top CDs) and you could see the growing pains on this one. This CD even more than On Through The Night shows the potential that this group had, and how close they were to breaking through to top the charts. If your Def Leppard collection starts with Pyromania, you NEED this CD. It's probably their best work, and that's not just because it has less of a pop feeling than their later work. This album rocks from top to bottom.
B000002UAX|5.0|Everybody has their favorite Beatles album, whether it's &quot;Sergeant Pepper...&quot;, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; or &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. Those are all remarkable works that they released, but when listing the Beatle greats, you simply cannot leave this album out of the list. In my view, this is the greatest album ever released. The songs on it mirrored their own personal lives (Like John's &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot; or Paul's &quot;I Will&quot;)and the world around them (Like &quot;The Continuing Story Of Bungalo Bill&quot;). This is probably why it was simply titled &quot;The Beatles&quot;, or more popularly known to their fans as &quot;The White Album&quot;.<br />It's kind of funny how such a prosperous album came out of undoubtedly the darkest year of the '60's, 1968. Many of the songs are short, but haunting. It starts with the snappy and upbeat &quot;Back In The U.S.S.R.&quot;, and ends with the fitting &quot;Good Night&quot;.<br />This was an album made when The Beatles were just about to go their separate ways and become individuals, which is why it carries such a different sound than previous albums they made. Of the greatest elements of &quot;The White Album&quot; is the chemistry the songs have together. Each sounds so different from one another, but they sound great together. It's one of Paul's songs followed by one of John's songs throughout the whole album, with sharp disturbances (good disturbances) by George and Ringo songs. Inside, a &quot;photo album&quot; is featured with pictures from their lives which makes it seem all the more intimate.<br />The song differences show how much each member was different. John's songs were deep and political. Paul's songs were &quot;pop-like&quot; and simple. George's songs, like John's, were very deep. Ringo's songs (well, his one song, &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot;) were very fun with nice melodies. <br />&quot;The White Album&quot; is also notable for it's variety. It has rock songs(&quot;Helter Skelter&quot;), pop songs(&quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;), protest songs (&quot;The Continuing Story Of Bungalo Bill&quot;), simple songs (&quot;Birthday&quot;), funny songs (&quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;), poetic songs (&quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;), personal songs (&quot;Julia&quot;), socialy conscious songs (&quot;Revolution 1&quot;), and other great songs.<br />You may not see the same thing I do in this album, or get the same profoundness on first listen, but even if you're not a Beatles fan, this is a music lover's album. And believe me, this is going to go on your Top 10 list.
067101756X|2.0|As the title of this review states, if this was whole truth behind the Roswell incident, the powers that be would not have let this book be published.<br />I believe this book may contain kernels of truth scattered here &amp; there but the potential to spread misinformation through a book such as this is enormous. I'm sure those truly in the know (no, I am not a mad conspiracy theorist!) are always glad when books such as this one are published as they help to further muddy the water and keep us ignorant of what's really happening in this world.<br />An OK book but not the &quot;truth&quot;, I think.
0345350499|4.0|This is a modern day classic. Don't miss it.
0446677450|5.0|This is a book designed to provoke you into thought and action. It will almost certainly make you uncomfortable - it's really difficult to read that the home you've been paying on for years isn't really an asset. Those of you that have been working for years at a job, looking forward to that retirement package, thinking that &quot;downsizing&quot; won't happen to you - well, it's time to take a look at your &quot;assets&quot; and &quot;income&quot; in a new light.<br />This book will NOT give you ideas to get rich quick. Instead, it  gives you examples of what the author and his wife did. The book is written in a conversational style, it is not a text book.<br />The author made much of his wealth in businesses that he did not have to run from day-to-day, and real estate, so most of his examples are drawn from that experience. He tells you that not every investment works all the time, everywhere. The message throughout the book is to &quot;Mind your own business&quot;. <br />The author does not tell you to quit your day job, he doesn't tell you to do what he did, he tells you what worked for him. He constantly compares his two dads because they provided a contrast for him - one highly educated, one not. One building his wealth so that he wouln't have to work so hard, and could spend more time with his family. The other working harder and harder, and spending less time with his family the more sucessful he became. This book does NOT belittle either of his fathers, it just gives a living example of two men working at their futures from different directions, and how it turns out for them, and what the author learned from each. There are life altering lessons there if you are willing to suspend judgement, and really listen to the words.<br />While some of the author's methods may not work for you personally, there is a critical underlying message here:  If you run your financial life as a business, whether you actually own a business or not, you will be further ahead than the majority of your peers. This book is worth the price many times over to anyone looking to better themselves - and their future - I can't recommend it enough !!!!
B000002J27|5.0|Ripples alone is worth buying this record for.  Although I really prefer the live version which is on Archive 2, this is nearly as good.  The instrumental in the middle with Hacketts' guitar kind of whining and wailing is just wonderful.  From Peter Gabriel through Phil Collins some of the best moments of the band is when no one is singing!  They have the best instrumental arrangements I've ever heard, and Ripples (the middle section) and Los Endos really display their creativity.  The main difference in their instrumentals between the Peter Genesis and Phil Genesis is Peters' flute.  It's really missed after he leaves the band, the calm, relaxing moments before he leads you into the storm such as on The Knife and Suppers Ready are really missed after his departure, but these tracks are nearly as good, if not as good.  If you're new to Genesis, this is a good albulm to start on... Duke, Three Sides Live, or Selling England By The Pound are other good starting points too.  Even if Ripples never come back, you're sure to come back to this albulm again and again.
0345347951|5.0|hi i am 17 and i hate reading books but this was one of the best books ive read and also one of the very few that i finished. I just wanted to tell people it is worth reading.
B000059MEK|1.0|After reading the other reviews, I can only assume I got someone else CD in the case - Nope, it says Daft Punk on it. <br />It's truly awful to be quite honest. It bears little correlation to the excellent work they did on Homework. Most of the beats are weak at best and the Cher-Believe/Antares Autotuned vocal is very overused with no imagination. The whole record sounds like a bad trip through the late seventies and early 80's. Sounds like they're trying to be Air instead of Daft Punk. They fail at that too - Air was cool and easy - this is cheesy, but maybe that's the point. If so, the joke is on those of us who bought it and the french duo must be laughing all the way to the bank.<br />They impersonate robots as they have become robots, capable of little but rehashing overused (and bad in the first place) ideas. It takes gimmicks like this to sell such a bad track. <br />In short, this is why it takes Daft Punk so long to run out another record - They've lost the wit, imagination and spark that was so abundant in Homework. There's a million better records come out this year already. Stop paying attention to this one. <br />I want to give this zero stars, but apparently you can't. It's that bad.
0316777722|4.0|\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a series of short stories about David Sedaris. His childhood, his different jobs, his family and - my favorite- when he moved to France, and tried to learn French.<br />I love the story of his childhood, how he due to his lisp becomes a kid with an outstanding vocabulary (to avoid words starting with \\"s\\"), the story of his artistic career, and also his brother - \\"The rooster\\". But his story about moving to France and trying to learn French is amongst the absolute best.<br />I can perfectly well relate to his frustration trying to learn another language. I have done something quite similar, I went to Ecuador to study Spanish with only 7 words in my vocabulary (the numbers 1-4, thank you, please and Merry Christmas) so I found those chapters absolute hilarious. My favourite is when he is having trouble with singular/plural and to circumvent this he always buys more than one, no matter what it is. His boyfriend is getting upset about this and I love Sedaris' comment \\"Just wait until he sees the *CD-players* I have bought for his birthday\\"...<br />I have not read many books that have made me laugh as much as this one has. To my surprise, Sedaris and his story kept me completely hooked for the 270 pages.<br />This book makes you laugh - laugh out loud!
0804115613|5.0|The story starts of in the 1920s into the 80s following the lives of the Threadgoode family from Whistle Stop, Alabama.  A family with a heart of gold is the heart of the little town of Whistle Stop.  And who better to tell the story then one of the members of this family, Ninny Threadgoode.  Ninny who grows up in the Threadgoode household and ends up marrying one of the Threadgoode boys puts her excellent story telling skills to use when she tells it to Evelyn Couch.<br />Ninny at the time in an old people's home befriends Evelyn who is a visitor over there and in desperate need of a friend as she is going through mid-life crisis.  Ninny goes on to tell a heartwarming story of Idgie Threadgoode, her sister-in-law.  Idgie, a heroine in every respect, defies the authority of the Klan as she serves to the Blacks in her Caf&eacute;, falls in love with a woman and makes a home with her, runs her own business.  She cannot be characterized as wild but she is fearless and sometimes reckless in her behavior.  Another thing working in favor of Idgie is a very supportive family and community.<br />Ninny goes on to tell a story of a people coming together in times of crisis and later the community falling apart as the country develops and people move into big cities.  During the course of her story telling, she saves Evelyn. Stories of Idgie's courage motivate Evelyn into bringing change in her own life for the better.<br />Although the movie version is great as well but lot of characters from the book are missing in the movie.  The book is an experience in itself.  The book will make you laugh, make you cry and you will remember the characters of this book for a long time.<br />ps.  There are recipes from the caf&eacute; in the end, an added bonus.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|Having watched this three times all the way through, I am now addicted to both the British and American versions. Each version has its own twists to similar situations and each is true to its environment - I do appreciate the uniqueness of each. If you love watching folks, you will love this. While living in the San Francisco area probably contributed to my initial tuning in of the American version, the stories and the character developments have hooked me - some remind me of tales of activities in San Francisco in the 1970s.   Can't wait until the American version is released on DVD. I don't think I am part of the QaF target audience since I am female, over 50, married and heterosexual, but these stories are great.
B00004Y635|1.0|I strongly didn't like this movie. I think it's because I just don't care for scary horror type of movies. But if you DO like them then this one might be for you.
B00004X01U|5.0|This is by far Madonnas coolest album yet. Just when you think shes done it all, she makes Music... Beautiful. I feel like she wrote Amazing for me. Anyways, I loved it. This is sure to become a classic.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Oh, no, another one?  Is this your first impression the moment you see this album?  I mean, as an all-time beatles' fan, you, like me, might already spent every penny on every single album that's availble in the market: The white and black, the blue and red, the anthology...and so on.  Is this one really necessary?  In my opinion, yes it is.  Why?  Because however perfect your collection may be, it's not like all-in-one.  You may have several most favorite songs, distributed in several different CDs or even LPs.  This is the CD that contains most of the Beatles' most hits.  My suggestion is, check the song list above first and evaluate if it's filled with most of your favorites.  If yes, you should definitely take the worth-the-price all-in-one collection.  You won't have to switch CDs all the time with this one, then.<br />For those who are not familiar with the beatles, this is your chance to have your first contact with them.  They represent a classic in the music history, and that's no accidental.  The album collects many of the beatles' most popular songs, altogether 27 songs in just on CD.  Those songs stayed in the board for so long for a reason.  Check it out. <br />Another good thing about the album is it introduces the beatles to the young generation.  The red cover with a big &quot;1&quot; on it attracts peoples' attention and they start to think: what's the beatles so great about anyways?  In that way, curiosity leads to trend.  If you have kids, this is a good chance for you to share your memory with them.  Trust me, they're going to fall in love with the beatles - just like you and me.
0425170349|4.0|The book starts by introducing John Clark who has left the CIA to create an England-based organization code-named &quot;Rainbow.&quot; Its mission: establish an elite squad of American operatives combined with handpicked British, French, and German agents to fight terrorism whenever it is required. Rainbow's emergence could not be more timely: in quick succession, the force solves three attempted terrorist problem such as an alleged bank robbery in Switzerland or an attack on a theme park in Spain. But Clark becomes suspicious when Russian agents suddenly show interest in Rainbow's work.  Later on in the book these Russians become more and more important as, in a narrative that simultaneously traces the Rainbow team, a former KGB agent named Popov is introduced. Following these two places of action the reader gets small pieces of information of a great puzzle that finally is revealed as a great conspiracy concerning the Australian Olympic security team and a strange group of American scientists. Bit by bit Tom Clancy is able to reveal artfully the mystery of &quot;Shiva&quot; [...]<br />The Rainbow Six-novel satisfies all the levels that Clancy like (A very famous book of this author is also \\"Hunt for Red October\\"). In the thrilling action of the book the Rainbow soldiers, from Navy troops to German fighters, are created to impress the reader by describing their physical and mental power such as \\"typical heroes\\". The book is infatuated with the latest developments and inventions in the technical sector. Therefore there are plenty of words to describe e.g. the operation instructions given to the Rainbow-Team besides the detailed descriptions of the weapons used. Clancy fans are used to this fact and are not annoyed by the unknown words that hardly anybody could know all at once - except a real soldier in the US-Army or the author himself who is visible in typical military clothing on the back cover of the book (At least when you study the \\"Berkley international edition / May 1999\\"). But besides this stereotype of hero-novels there's a fact that evoked deeper thoughts in me because of the postulate that humanity should be punished for their rape of nature although it can be a reason to destroy mankind.  In my opinion this novel is a very good piece of literature and I am convinced that also many people who have never read a book of this author will agree to me after studying it. In retrospect the book has been very successful until nowadays because there's also a PC-Game in which you can become a member of the elite-force and lots of famous magazines and newspapers praise \\"Rainbow Six\\" e.g. the Dallas Morning news writes \\"When the door blows and the shooting starts, nobody does it better\\".<br />Johannes Weiß
B000002OX7|5.0|There are a few problems with this album.  Firstly, the three best songs, `Baba O'Riley', `Behind Blue Eyes', and most of all, `Won't Get Fooled Again', have been rather overplayed (though not, fortunately, to `Stairway to Heaven' levels).  Secondly, this reissue was an obvious opportunity to assemble the other songs from the aborted Lifehouse project, such as `Relay', `Let's See Action', `Join Together', `Time is Passing,' `Long Live Rock', et al in one at least vaguely coherent package. Was this opportunity taken? Was it ****. Heaven alone knows why. Wilful neglect, sheer sloppiness, or a calculated move to get the punters to buy this, plus Odds and Sods, plus the box set? I wonder, although not very much.  Another problem is that at times `Song is Over' can drag a bit, and `Pure and Easy' is a tad over-rated, and...<br />Sod it. I can't really grizzle for too long. Much as I hate to gush, this is a masterpiece. The new tracks do add to the album, as they should, although the original was already superb. In particular, the alternate take of `Love Ain't for Keeping' included here ROCKS, with Townshend (pissed out of his mind, according to the recent Keith Moon biog) taking an impassioned lead vocal.  The three aforementioned classics are here in all their glory - `Baba O'Riley' mixed a three chord wonder approach with synthesisers and a lyric where Townshend's spiritual concerns met youth culture; `Behind Blue Eyes' starts as a ballad and then when the rock bursts through in the middle an unleashed Keith Moon turns the drums into a lead instrument; and `Won't Get Fooled Again', which set the template for a decade of hard rock - guitars and drums bouncing off each other.  Other highlights include `Bargain' - while some of the song's metaphysical musings leave me cold (&quot;I'm looking for that free ride to me&quot; sounds like a slogan for the whole spoilt, self-centred baby-boomer generation) the playing was never bettered by the Who. The entire band outdoes itself on this track. And that's saying something.  `Pure and Easy' is another great number, to be sure, although I've never been able to understand why some critics rate as a great lost Who track. To me, it's always trembled on the brink of pretentiousness, without actually falling over. And that line about &quot; a child flew past me riding in a star&quot; has always sounded so DISNEY! Having said that, every time I have it on the stereo I always find myself humming it a few hours later. But overall, while the best opportunity to re-assemble the component bits of Lifehouse has been shamefully neglected, the basic music still stands. And that music is some of the best of the rock era.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I wanted desperately to see this movie in the theaters, but with two small children at home, it was impossible.  Thank goodness it came out on videotape!  I am a huge Cameron Crowe fan (&quot;Say Anything&quot; is my favorite), and I was not disappointed in this film.  The acting by Fugit, Hudson, Crudup, and McDormand were excellent.  I keep seeing the scene between Crudup and McDormand on the phone, and I have to smile.  Billy Crudup was the epitome of a rock singer in the 70's; I couldn't have cast his role any better.  Kate Hudson was wonderful as the band's groupie.  The music in the film was fantastic; I haven't heard some of those songs in a long time.  Knowing that the film was semi-autobiographical made it all the better.  Camerone Crowe did a great job with this movie.  I was so happy to see that he won the Oscar for best original screenplay.<br />If you want a great movie for a Friday night with friends, rent this one!
0385493800|4.0|This was one of my favorite books written by Grisham. He has shown that he has a human side, something that is quite uncommon amongst lawyer. Perhaps he did in fact make the right career choice when he moved away from a future of jurisprudence and power lunches. In the modern fast paced world would think that the probability of an alcoholic and a missionary hitting it off as they dit in this story to be impossible. I, and Grisham, have said and think why not??It is well told story that I thoroughly enjoyed right up to the last page.
0783228317|5.0|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is unlike any movie you will see for quite a while.  The visionary behind 12 MONKEYS and THE FIShER KING Terry Gilliam has directed this film about a drug-addicted journalist and his equally addicted lawyer with style and panache.  Based on the popular book,  this film is both moving and hilarious on so many different levels.  The plot is basically this:  Raul Duke(played by Johnny Depp;  Edward Scissorhands,  Blow,  Ed Wood),  is a journalist for an unnamed magazine,  who is asked to cover a race in Vegas.  Taking along his lawyer Dr.  Gonzo(Recent Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro;   Traffic,  Snatch,  The Usual Suspects),  they embark on a drug-induced farcical journey into Las Vegas where anything can happen and often does.  The excellent direction and cinematography in this film is stunning,  as well as the performances by the two stars.  Johnny Depp is incredible as Duke/Narrator,  definitely one of his best yet unknown performances(He is somewhat unrecognizable without a head of hair).  Del Toro rocks as Dr.  Gonzo.  Definitely a sign of things to come as he would launch himself into some of the best performances of his career.  Also,  there are many great and memorable cameos by Tobey Maguire,  Ellen Barkin,  Christina Ricci,  Christopher Meloni,  Craig Bierko,  Cameron Diaz,  heck!  Even Dr.  Evil's Mini-Me makes a two second appearance if you look closely.  All in all,  a riotous and riveting movie that I absolutely love!
B00005B7CK|4.0|I have to admit it, George Clooney was very funny. Three prisoners, they are 'forced' to break out of prison together, he and John Tuturro, and another convict are all chained together. They escape through the deep south, hooking up with a blues guitar player who has sold his soul to the devil for the ability to play the guitar. They go on to record a hit song, and become stars, playing Mississippi delta blues. Very, very, very funny.  If you like this one, check out Millers Crossing.
B000003TAW|5.0|Quite possible the worlds most perfect CD.  Every song is great even 7 years later...if you dont have this CD you should...BRING ON THE GREEN ALBUM...I NEED MORE WEEZER!
B000059MEK|1.0|ok here is the deal.  if you like danceable house music like the kind that jumped off of homework, you get &quot;one more time&quot;.  And that is the last time you'll hear a good house track on the album.  The rest of the album is trying to move out of dance music and more into moby style electronica.  Music to listen to, not to dance to with a mesh of different styles of music and lots of vocals.  To me, this was a disappointment because I think these guys have the talent to really make people move.  If that feeling you got when you first popped in homework is what you think your gonna get, dont even listen to the cd.  It will break your heart.
B00002DE2L|2.0|And I don't mean that in a good way.  While I give credit to ASM for her obvious intelligence and her commitment to artistic exploration (you can always tell that she's thought every note through), I also think that her artistic aspirations can backfire, as they seem to do in this CD.  She obviously wants her Vivaldi to sound &quot;fresh,&quot; &quot;modern,&quot; &quot;romantic,&quot; &quot;hip.&quot;  What her recording of the Vivaldi ends up being, however, is an interpretation that screams, above the music itself, &quot;Hey, this ain't your mama's Vivaldi!&quot;  Her need to push boundaries exhausts me after a while.  <br />There are certainly some glorious moments, but again, they're overshadowed by a lack of subtlety and also by an ensemble that seems to be better suited driving a Mack truck than playing Vivaldi.  You can hear them coming from miles away.  <br />And all that self-congratulatory stuffing between the CD covers...what's up with that?
6302610702|5.0|The Godfather trilogy, the greatest gangster movies ever made without a shadow of a doubt.  The Performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and not forgetting the fantastic performance of Fredo by John Cazale along with James Caan's performance as the passionate but violent Santino are the best they have ever produced.  The first two movies are arguably two of the greatest movies ever produced and even though the third Godfather film took a grilling from the critics I feel it is a movie that shows Michael Corleone in his true light as an ordinary man who is searching for peace in his life and redmption for his mistakes.  The scene where he confesses all to Cardinal Lamberto is truly touching and the standard of acting produced by Pacino to show his grief at the loss of his daughter towards the end of the film is the greatest moment of cinematic acting ever produced.......
B000002UAX|5.0|Paul McCartney has said somewhere that the last few songs on any given album tend to be a little weaker than those which open the album. Given that the Beatles came from the age of the LP, when emphasis was given to Side One of something which had to be flipped on its back in order to be heard in its entirety,it makes sense that the first disc of the only double-LP they made while still a group is more concentrated than the second disc. George Harrison says he thinks of it as two distinct albums. My theory is that it's like a giant 45. The A-side is meant to be the hit; the B-side is more obscure. Sides One and Two of &quot;The Beatles&quot; have a punch which means business; Sides Three and Four are loose. Lennon once called it &quot;Son of Sgt. Pepper.&quot; It's the one recording the Beatles did which reached further than they'd intended. Nobody is indifferent to this one.
0385493622|5.0|Singh's account of the conquest of Fermat's Last Theorem goes far beyond just the history of Andrew Wiles's sucessful proof.  The story begins all the way back in the time of Pythagoras, and Singh tells it in an informative and entertaining style.<br />You need very little knowledge of math to understand this book.  What little you do need, Singh tells you lucidly and without patronizing his readers.  The book is full of human-interest stories from the history of mathematics (and yes, there are many!), so the book is certainly not for mathematicians only.<br />It's remarkable that Singh can discuss the activities of research-level mathematicians in such an easily-readable book, but he has done it.  Highly recommended!
B00004SU5J|4.0|In a wonderfull colaberative effort, St Germain brings together a mixture of the UK's Massive Attack vs The Mad Proffessor, Adrian Sherwood/Primal Screams's ECHODEK, and Modern Jazz.  The result is an amazing audio expierience good for listening at all levels.  Be it in you home on the Hi-Fi, or in your car with the windows rolled down.  St Germain definitly catches all of your audio interests and lets you expierience the wonderfully trippy and melodic tunes encased in this amazing CD.  After only hearing a few of the tracks, I had made up my mind.  This CD belongs in my collection along with all the other greats.
B00005B6C9|5.0|If you like The Bee Gees then this is the CD for you and I bought me a copy today and I love it and so far this is the Best of 2001.
B00005214X|5.0|With its laid-back, gentle line of songs, this album is an excellent choice for Beatles fans and non-Beatles fans in search of a mellow listen. Harrison's mastery of the slide guitar is almost as pleasant to listen to as his reedy voice.  There are many great cameos from a who's-who list of classic rock artists, such as Dylan, Clapton, Starr, and most surprisngly Phil Collins on the congos.  There are also many great extra tracks, with hardly any of them warrenting the label \\"filler\\".  This re-issue is a keeper.
B00005B6C9|5.0|This CD is totally amazing.  Old sound of the Bee Gees mixed with sound of today.  If you love the Bee Gees or are just getting to know the Bee Gees this is a CD for you.  Each song is totally different from the one before.  Has so many different sounds would be a definite for any kind of music lover.  Standouts on the CD would be Sacred Trust, Wedding Day, Embrace, She Keeps On Coming and The Extra Mile.  Hard to pick a favorite for this one because they are all so amazing.  A definite 10 on a scale from 1 to 5.  Love it - definite must.
6302799066|5.0|This is the best comedy ever! And what scares me, is that it is probably very realistic. Fiction can never outdo reality!!! Thats the genius of this film. If you like sick sick sick comedy, you`ll just love this movie.<br />Just notice this.. The plot is serious and it is possible to believe it. Its the stupidity of the carachters and the entire world-political system that makes me smile.<br />Imagine this. Both the presidents in the movie can destroy the whole world. But they only have a bad phone line to communicate with to each other.. Hehe...<br />And of course, we have the &quot;ragnarok&quot; expert Dr. Strangelove. An imported German scientist, that of course is raving mad, and has the right solutions for the situation that occures at the end of the movie. <br />I challenge you all: Is there any better way to deal with a worldwide nuclear catastrophy then the solutions Dr. Strangelove got????<br />But remember, if you`re wong, you got to answer to the coca-cola company!!!
B00003CXMG|5.0|There were some great films last year, but this one for me took the cake. It just encompassed everything - romance, fun, adventure, drama, comedy, passion, love, heart and soul. It was FABULOUS! And the music - it'll blow you away! Rent it, see it, buy it, enjoy it! It is definately a classic treasure.
B000002U9L|5.0|I have seen the movie, but I have never listened to the whole soundtrack... but one song that I have heard and love, As the World Falls Down is such an amazing love song... the soundtrack would be worth it just for that song... trust me, listen to that song with the person you love, and you'll be brought to tears... it is my favorite love song... buy the album for that song, and if you like the other songs then that's an added bonus, but trust me, As the World Falls Down is a beautiful, and magic love song that almost brings me to tears everytime I listen to it... the soundtrack is worth the money just for that song...
6304698623|5.0|I rented this movie for Vanessa Lee Chester... and shes only one of the reasons i like this movie... it also has a very nice story line! This movie is VERY entertaining! And Vanessa Lee Chester is soooo hott! and fine!
1559408855|5.0|This film is the sickest one I have ever seen, and I love it! Based upon Marquis de Sade's \\"120 Days of Sodom,\\" this film deals with the grotesque acts of what was described in the novel, but instead of the 18th century, it is taking place during WW2 with young teenagers. The film itself is extremely graphic and will leave people with weak stomachs running for the toilet. Personally, I loved it. Due to censors these days, people do not get to see the full affect of many stories because everyone is worried about weak-minded children. This film chose to ignore that case and present it full force. Thank you, Pasolini!
0671042858|4.0|This book is far different from other SK novels, first of all this has to be the shortest book from Stephen King I've ever read.  Second, unlike &quot;Insomnia&quot; and &quot;Desperation&quot; this book lacks a strong supernatural tone.  But, over all, this book was a nice read and might just get some new Stephen King readers, while keeping the returning victims of his books interested.
B000059ZLH|5.0|At last I can see what the musicians are doing up there on stage!  Petrucci is lightening fast, Portnoy creative and enthusiastic, LeBrie hits vocal ranges no one but an opera star can hit, Rudess is absolutely incredible, and the fingers on both of John Myung's hands fly over his six-string bass.  I spend most of my time watching this video saying &quot;holy moly - how do they DO that?!?&quot; and being totally enthralled by the music.  Thank you, thank you for giving the fans this terrific video!
B00005B6C9|4.0|The new Bee Gees album, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;, is a strong collection of material.  Following the excellent 1997 release, &quot;Still Waters&quot;, the Gibb Brothers had the difficult task of producing an album that could surpass that triumph.  Instead of making &quot;Still Waters Part 2&quot;, the group decided to re-tool their sound slightly.  Gone are the falsetto vocals and bombastic, slick production.  The title track opens the record with the brothers utilizing acoustic guitar and live drums.  The verse is sort of a broken melody with brothers Robin and Barry trading lead vocals.  The chorus is very catchy and led by powerful vocals from Robin.  This is a very typical Bee Gees song in terms of the looping chorus and excellent harmonies.  Next is &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot;, which is an up-tempo rocker featuring Robin on the lead.  Complete with electric guitar and an anthemic chorus, his track resembles Dire Straits - &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; and the lyrics are quite clever.  The two ballads that follow are quite good, especially &quot;Wedding Day&quot; where Barry handles the verses while Robin sings the chorus.  It is quite melodic as is &quot;Sacred Trust&quot;, which showcases Barry's breathy vocals.  The two Maurice lead vocals, especially &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; are strong.  This track has some great guitar and fanstastic production.  &quot;Walking On Air&quot; is a little weaker overall but the chorus is quite refreshing and is clearly influenced by the Beach Boys.  &quot;Deja Vu&quot; is a mid-tempo synth track with lead vocals from Robin.  The track that follows entitled, &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, is a 40's style piano bar ditty.  It's quite bizarre at first but it is a stylistic triumph and Barry pulls it off with a nice delivery and simple lyrics.  &quot;Loose Talk Costs Live&quot; is Barry Gibb's best vocal on the album.  This soothing ballad coupled with Barry's silky vocals is a real treasure.  This gem is followed by &quot;Embrace&quot;, a slightly above average dance track with a much slower intro.  Robin sounds quite good on it, but overall &quot;Deja Vu&quot; is superior.  The second-to-last song, &quot;The Extra Mile&quot; is the best song on the disc.  Originally written for the 2000 Olympics, this lush ballad features a full orchestra that introduces the song with a hint of patriotism.  As on previous tracks, Barry takes the verses and Robin sings an incredibly uplifting chourus.  In terms of melody it is top notch and the vocal performance is phenomenal.  The album closes with a fast-paced rocker called &quot;Voice In The Wilderness.&quot;  It is the least melodic track on the album, but is very exciting.  They obviously wanted to try something a bit different and the performance is solid.  Not my favorite track, but certainly no worse than average.  Overall, this is a very good album.  The group is in fine voice throughout, especially Robin who sings more lead vocals than usual.  The production and musicianship is masterful.  I must say I would not have minded a little bit of falsetto, but the Bee Gees obviously felt that it had run its course.  Whether this album eclipses &quot;Still Waters&quot; is hard to say.  Yes, the production on that album was much slicker, but the melodies may have been a little more memorable than those present here.  Still it is a very consistent album and certainly a must for any Bee Gees fan.  Highly Recommended.
B00005ABX0|4.0|The Brothers Records &quot;2-fer&quot; reissue fest continues with the runner-up for best in the series (next to &quot;Sunflower/Surf's Up&quot;). The remastered &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and its related &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; sessions bonus track alone is worth the price of admission. Too much obsessive musicologist handwringing has occurred lamenting over the &quot;shoulda-coulda-wouldas&quot; that &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; &quot;hints&quot; at. Listen folks, lets get over it, it's been 35 years, two Wilson brothers are gone, Brian still drags himself out in public beyond all possible odds (Syd Barrett hasn't ventured back onstage since 1968...think about it!) to please his fans and 95% of the &quot;artists&quot; currently charting can't show me anything from thier set list that is one-half as creative as any 30 seconds from &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. The experimentation of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, coupled with the rootsier rock/R &amp; B sound of the &quot;Wild Honey&quot; album almost turns this compilation into the Beach Boys' &quot;White Album&quot;, unique in thier canon. Excellent remastering and interesting bonus tracks make this one a winner.
B00005ASOC|3.0|My very favorite movie of all time is &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; That is an example of a film where the writing, acting, and directing clicked so perfectly to create a modern film masterpiece. The story was heartfelt and, although touching, was not too mushy or sentimental as to turn off male viewers.  Now why did I mention &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; in a review of &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;? The reason is simple: In many respects, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; are the same movie. And that doesn't even factor in the facts that Gus Van Sant directed both movies, and that Matt Damon, the star of &quot;Good Will,&quot; has a cameo near the end of this film. Look at the similarities: Both films tell the tales of underpriveleged young men who have minds that are so brilliant it would seem impossible that they could have come from the meager backgrounds from which they did. Both male leads have friends or brothers who recognize their talent and do not want them to squander it by remaining at their current station in life. Both men become befriended by older men who are also stuck at a dead end in their lives. Through various meetings, the older men help the younger men reach their potentials, just as the younger men help them realize that they could still have great lives if they break out of the shells they created for themselves. &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is definitely a beautiful film. It is set apart by Sean Connery's brilliant performance and his easy interaction with the young actor who plays Jamal. Their friendship is a really beautiful story. Unfortunately, the film as a whole is inferior when compared to &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; Although Anna Paquin is wonderful as Jamal's love interest, their relationship is never as interesting as the complex and multilayered one Will had with Skyler. Also, &quot;Forrester's&quot; characters fit too much into set cliches much more than the very original ideas of &quot;Hunting&quot;.  Old colleagues/enemies occur in both. The difference is Forrester dislikes Jamal's teacher based on his writings, although he never met him. Sean, from &quot;Hunting&quot; has an old personal relationship with Will's teacher that is intriguing in its blend of friendship and animosity. Also, the bottom line for me is Jamal is just not as interesting as Will. Maybe he would have been if he came first, but he just doesn't seem to have the personality and fire in life that Will does. On one level, all these similarities do not matter, though. The film really is beautiful and even reaches brilliance in many areas, but unfortunately its similarities to &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; are so overwhelming that it seems as times that the only differences is the color of Jamal's skin. Compare Jamal's talk to the racist white man in the BMW and Will's famous &quot;How do ya like them apples&quot; speech, and you'll see they're really the same scene. The subtext might be different, but both are based on brilliant people breaking down others assumptions of them based on outward appearances. If only this movie had taken a different direction and been more original, I could have said it had shades of &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; but didn't copy it completely linearly. Unfortunately, that's not true.
B00000I01A|5.0|If there is a better training CD,I have yet to see one.There are only ten songs on this CD,but all of them are very good.Especially good are 1,2,4,5,6,7,10.The rest are also good,but not quite in the same league.This CD helps a lot when you are feeling depressed.I ahve had this CD for about two years and I am still a fan of both the movies and the soundtracks. If you liked this CD,you will also like the original Rocky CD,which concentrates more on jazz and less on training music which was not as popular back in the 70's.Worth every dollar.

1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements are a practical wisdom to live our daily lives by in getting back to basics in a complex world.  Words are important tools, and thus we should say what we mean is an important aphorism to be learned. So is asking what is meant, and not making assumptions. Not taking things personally is equally important but harder to master, as it is similar to the Buddhic philosophy of mindfulness and impersonality. Finally, striving to do our best in our endeavors and in dealing with others with love while maintaining our spiritual integrity provides inspiration to live each day to the fullest. Other important books/authors for those on the spiritual path are:  &quot;The Kybalion&quot;- by Three Initiates ; &quot;Meditation&quot;- by Sri Chinmoy ; &quot;Lessons From the Light&quot;- by Kenneth Ring ; &quot;The Mystic Path&quot;- by Raymund Andrea. And the books by Zachary Lansdowne &amp; Alice Bailey for the more advanced on the spiritual path.
B000056VIY|3.0|Well, I heard Ms. Lopez's first CD and thought there was too many ballads, but this one is catchy, more uptempo, and ecletic.  However, the lyrics are very repetitive.  You'll find yourself asking, &quot;Didn't she say that in another song?&quot;  There are some good songs on the album, my favorites being  I'm Real, Play, Walking on Sunshine, Come over, Talk to Me, That's not me, and Dame.  I'm not a hardcore J.Lo fan, but her voice doesn't sound that bad.  She knows her vocal range and never goes out of it.  I would even go as far as to say that she is pleasant to listen to.  If you like cheesy bubblegum music, then you will like this.  It is not a bad investment.
B000000W9Z|5.0|This album is a forgotten classic but has been brought back to life by that good ole boy Marilyn Mansun. During his album Mechanical Animals he mixed Outside with Marillion's marillion.com and didn't do either justice. Listen to this album its fantastic.
0452282152|4.0|This is a beautifully told story.  It explores the complications and private motivations in the heart and home of the painter Vermeer.  We are privy to the interior world of the artist through the eyes of a young maid. Her relationship with the painter and his capacity to &quot;see&quot; her and the world around him are a fascinating study in human perception.  He uses a box to transpose the image of the girl and to allow him to experience the world in a different way and thereby paint with a different vision.  The family around him is turning upside down while he hides under the cover of the black box.  The placement of this gentle story on the best seller list is a reaffirmation of humanity's  need for mystery. The slow revelation of the characters to the reader mirrors the experience of visually absorbing a great work of art. We stand and stare until we see what we perceive to be the true message behind the painting.
B00003CXMG|1.0|Possibly the most overrated movie of all time. I almost gave up on this one at least half a dozen times. Absolutely no character development. Kate Hudson was horrible. I laughed maybe twice. There was nothing--absolutely nothing--interesting going on in this movie at any point, on any level, with the possible exception of PSH. It's mindboggling that so many people liked this....
B0000025DV|5.0|I had the 8-track in the late 70's and can't wait to hear these splendid sounds again on CD.  Nothing like it.
B00000AFGM|5.0|What if you take David Bowie's OUTSIDE album and Marillion's MARILLION.COM album and put them in the blender? Well you get this album actually. Its not a bad effort but you should check out the other two first.
B0000024K1|5.0|When it comes to reviewing &quot;It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back&quot; - I'm more along the lines of Flava Flav than Chuck D. I could wax eloquent about this album Chuck D.'s commanding forceful style: &quot;The bass pounds in your ears as Chuck D.'s authoritative baritone raps jackhammer the dense sonic texture of The Bomb Squad.&quot; You get the point, critics hype this album so much just go to any review and I guarantee you, they'll have mouthfuls to say. But all I really want to say is &quot;Yeaaaaahhhh boyyeeeee!&quot; What is seriously left to say about this album that hasn't been said before? It's the most brilliant and the best hip-hop/rap album EVER. I mean, just the way everything interlocks and moves - its seamless yet you can distinguish all the jigsaw pieces. Its just one of the most amazing rock/hip-hop/punk albums you'll listen to. Look at everything that this album has: First of all, Chuck D. - he's not an amazing rapper but he has a edgy urgency in his voice that gives him a conviction and an almost scary acusatory command. He confronts issues like racism, drugs, and authority. I'm not black but Public Enemy is appealing because its essentially the core of the music which is rebellion against stereotypes and asking people to be open-minded in questioning authority and situations. But Chuck D. would be nothing without his sidekick Flava Flav and most important THE BOMB SQUAD. Squeals, sirens, wicked scratching, guitar, moans, drum beats give the album an almost claustrophobic paranoid feel. Its just beautiful how all these elements are torn down and then built up into this monstrous sonic structure. Public Enemy are not anti-Government nor are they racist. But I don't want to get into politics or history, even if you don't agree with some of their beliefs you have to respect Public Enemy for their influence and sheer strength of belief and conviction.
B00002613K|5.0|I first heard this album in basic training for the British Army in late 1986, a recruit friend playing this on his tape recorder while doing laundry.  I'd never heard of Magnum and thought they were a new group, my friend soon filled me in on what I'd missed.<br />Now while I like some of the early stuff (Just Like An Arrow &amp; How Far Jerusalem amongst the few), this album is the definitive Magnum album for me.  Produced by Roger Taylor of Queen, this album shows the group in true radio-friendly rock mode and the influence of Taylor is clear when you listen to other material.  A lot of rock purists are not so hot on this style, but it's the only way I listen to rock so I'm happy.  There's not a duff track on this album, even though Magnum didn't get their commercial breakthrough until the follow-up single Start Talking Love a few years later (before sadly fading away again).<br />Best tracks : Need A Lot Of Love, Midnight (You Won't Be Sleeping), When The World Comes Down &amp; Back Street Kid, although the rest are not far behind.  Although it's very much an album of it's time, it is still a big player in my house.
B000058983|5.0|Of all of the L.A. bands of the mid to late 60's, Love was the one band that most perfectly blended the hazy hippie rock with the darker underbelly of L.A.; nowhere is this dichotomy more brutally apparent than on the band's 3rd lp, &quot;Forever Changes.&quot;<br />Jim Morrison said on more than one occasion that Love was the band he wanted the Doors to be. While this notion was admirable, Morrison et al never even remotely approached what Love was- the perfect mix of the late Bryan MacLean's moving long songs (the gorgeously lush &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; and his look at not only love, but respect between elders and youth in the tearjearker &quot;Old Man&quot;) with the harrowing look of life through the eyes of Arthur Lee.<br />From the opening chords of MacLean's &quot;Alone Again Or,&quot; the album is special. As he always did, MacLean is able to convey the whimsy of the hippie era through his lyrics. The wonderful use of spanish style guitar adds to the beauty of the song. MacLean was the master of love songs, and he scores a bulls eye here.<br />From here,(save the haunting &quot;Old Man&quot;) founder and leader Arthur Lee's incresasingly disoriented (yet also amazingly perceptive and eerily prophetic) world view takes front and center. &quot;A House is Not a Motel&quot; takes on people's lust for violence, while the horrifying &quot;Red Telephone&quot; takes on paranoia, and is easily the most disturbing song in Love's canon. &quot;Andmoreagain&quot; can be seen as an updated version of the Beatles &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; in all honesty. The sentiments are more or less the same. The Hendrix based &quot;Bummer in the Summer&quot; is also a harrowing piece of amazing work.<br />The brilliance of Lee and MacLean come front and center on this essential re-issue from Rhino records, who continue to bring on the goods from the 60's. No collection can be complete without it; It is the last great moment of late 60's L.A. rock. Amazing.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The proper use of Special Effects is to enhance a film, not to outshine the actors, characters, or story. Sadly, Lucas spent too much time on his visual 'sumptuous feast', rather than developing characters, and especially their interaction with each other. <br />The premise itself offered no real prelude to the famous trilogy, where it should have been exploring the origins of the Force, the Dark Side and the Jedi Council, then leading into the action sequences. At least Terry Brooks got that bit correct in the book, when he explained the significance of a Master and an Apprentice (there are only ever two), and the history of the Dark Side.<br />Jar Jar Binks is almost completely superfluous to the plot (almost, because he does serve the role of Guide), and is essentially there as a marketing gimmick for children; just listen to his dialogue! - &quot;Exsqueeeze me!&quot;<br />What made the original trilogy brilliant was that the story was character driven. Han was a scroundel, Luke was a naive youth coming of age, Leia was a feisty girl and so on. These characters had depth, whereas no-one in Episode One did.<br />The imagination and story-telling skills behind the first triology were clever and artistic. It is clear Lucas has the talent and skill to make brilliant movies based around strong, well-developed characters and stories. Unfortunately, with Ep. 1, he seemed more concerned about producing a marketing giant. He knew people would flock to the movie because it was Star Wars and so did not need to entice people to the cinema wih strong characters and interesting storylines.<br />I hope that with Episode II Lucas goes back to more traditional story telling methods, ie., characterisation, dramatisation, plot line developments, in order to tell a great tale. The potential is there for a great new trilogy - the tale of a boy strong with the Force succombing to the powers of the Dark Side is a tragic scenario and should be dealt as one - not some flamboyant expression of digital technology mimicking artwork.
0345409671|5.0|Question: Why on earth should Rice (or any author) be expected to limit herself to writing one type of novel, in one style, on one note? For that seems to be what the negative reviews here seem to be insisting she do. A sampling of these would turn up such words and phrases as &quot;it's boring,&quot; &quot;this isn't a vampire novel,&quot; &quot;this isn't Lestat,&quot; &quot;it's out of character,&quot; &quot;offensive,&quot; and many other such (let's be polite here) well-intentioned chidings...all of which sound rather put out, and many of which miss the point entirely.<br />First, let's take the notions that this isn't a vampire novel, that it isn't Lestat, and that his behavior is out of character, and dispense with them right off. One: It seems to me that this is a vampire novel, as it does have its share of vampires haunting the pages. Two: If you study the overall arc of Lestat's character, from Interview through to Memnoch, the overall effect is a softening of Lestat's hard, conscienceless demeanor -- The Tale of the Body Thief really brings this to the fore, in fact; read it again and see if I'm wrong. Memnoch's characterization of Lestat in my mind is perfectly in keeping with what's gone before. As to the idea that the characters do not act in keeping with their usual presentations in Rice's previous vampire novels, well, ask yourself this: If you met, in the span of a few hours, both God and Satan, and had your mind blown by both Heaven and Hell, AND had your entire belief system turned upside-rightside-inside-out, how rationally would YOU act? My guess is not very, and that was part of the point Rice was trying to make: we're far too comfortable in our various faiths, and that kind of complacency is very dangerous. We need to question more, Rice is saying. We need to ask hard questions -- even if we don't like the answers.<br />Which brings us nicely to addressing what a lot of people say about this novel: That it's offensive, that it portrays God asa bumbling incompetent and Lucifer as the wronged party...and worse, that he's attractive to boot. Well, let me just say this about that: This is a work of FICTION, folks. A novel. A big fat lie, told to amuse and amaze you in your unoccupied moments, nothing more. If you're offended by the notion of a fictional vampire sinking his teeth into the fictional neck of a fictional Christ on the cross (note that Lestat makes no appearances in the Bible!), then maybe your faith isn't as strong as you think it is. At the very least you need to get out more often. And so Memnoch is handsome, attractive and persuasive. So what? Isn't that what makes evil such a siren call -- that so much of the time it is attractive, tempting, seductive? Would Eve ever have been tempted if the serpent hadn't used honeyed words and gentle persuasion? Finally, God is not presented as a bumbler here so much as he is cold and indifferent to his own creation -- and haven't many of us suffered from that suspicion in our darkest moments? &quot;Where were you when I made the world?&quot; God asks Job when Job questions him -- in other words, I have a plan and you don't know the half of it, pal. The thought that God knows what he's doing, but doesn't trust us enough to let us know too, has driven plenty of people to question, even doubt, their own faith. (And I'll fill you in on a little secret, too. It's all right to question and doubt. I'm sure God has his doubts about us sometimes. It's when you let those doubts drive you from God that you become endangered.)<br />Okay, what's next? Is Memnoch boring? Well, maybe -- if you have the attention span of a gnat. (Thought I was going to be polite here; oh well...) If you go into this novel expecting typical Lestat-type adventures, you will be disappointed. If, however, you pry that cover open without any expectations other than reading a well-told, intelligently-thought-out tale, you may just be in for a treat. Yes, it is a tale that's been told before,notably by Milton in Paradise Lost (&quot;It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven&quot;), but Rice comes up with a few wrinkles even Milton never thought of. This is not your average chapter of the Vampire chronicles (thank goodness)...which brings me back around to my original question. If Rice had written a more typical Lestat adventure, I'd be willing to bet that the reviews on this page would be even more scathing: &quot;We've read this before! How about something new? It's the same thing over and over again!&quot; etc. It's easy -- far too easy -- to tell the same story over and over again, as witness the novels of Sidney Sheldon, Jackie Collins, and (God save us and preserve us) Barbara Cartland. Rice could make a comfortable living doing that -- but instead she comes at us (or at the very least tries to) with a different perspective nearly every time, with a different story to tell. This is how writers become better at the craft: they try new things, explore new ideas, stake out new territory in their lives and minds. This, by the way, is also how people expand their horizons, by leaving behind the old and familiar for the new and uncharted. I'm proud to say my horizons were expanded by Anne Rice's bold, daring departure from her usual fare, and hope for more of the same in the future.<br />P.S.: You want to read a really boring novel? Try something by Sheldon &amp; co. I guarantee a fast cure for insomnia. Remain In Light -- Phrodoe.
0399146253|5.0|Another great addition to the Kay Scarpetta series.  Readers should beware - you really should read the rest of the series before this one.  This book relies on the reader knowing the history of Kay and the other characters.  I really enjoyed this book because it gave better insight into Kay - her background, what drives her.  Once again, P. Cornwell has written a great book and I can't wait for the next.
B000002U3P|4.0|A strong collection to accompany one of the best movies of the 1990s. It's an agreeable blend of pre-punk and post-punk with no \\"punk\\" music--or what I'd call punk music--to be found. Which is to say that it ably blends tracks from such American stalwarts of the 1970s as Iggy Pop (\\"Lust for Life\\", \\"Nightclubbing\\") and Lou Reed (\\"A Perfect Day\\") with contemporary Brits like Blur, Elastica, Pulp, and Underworld.<br /><br />And you'll appreciate it even more if you've seen the movie--like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino and PT Anderson--Danny Boyle really knows how to jack up a scene by adding just the right song to it. Witness the irony of \\"A Perfect Day\\" playing while Renton (Ewan MacGregor) is having one of the worst days of his life. Lou Reed's lovely little number adds just the right touch of irony to the proceedings. The soundtrack as a whole serves a similar purpose in preventing the movie from ever descending into pathos or self-pity...and you can enjoy it even without the amazing visuals.
0920668364|5.0|I started crying at about halfway through when I picked this up at the bookstore last weekend and was bawling even just telling my husband about it.  It's a book more for a parent than a child, and being grateful for what you have.<br />I honestly have no idea why anyone would find this book to be 'creepy' at all -- some of what several of the negative reviewers were saying was not anything I saw in the books at all -- nor would it be anything any other reasonable person would see.  If they interpret such messages from such a simple book one could suppose that they went into reading it looking for such trouble instead. <br />Take the book for what it is -- the simple lesson of sharing love from one generation to the next.
B000005JA8|5.0|If there is an album that to me represents the willingness to let go and challenge oneself musically without caring about how uncommercial the final result may become, it has to be &quot;Trout mask replica&quot; - one of the few releases, that truly deserve to be mentioned as an immortal masterpiece in 20th century music - regardless of genre!<br />Hilarious, baffling, dadaistic, surreal, frustrating and far out are only words that briefly summon up what this album creates of notions upon hearing it for the first time. I still remember the initial impact of this album on me VERY clearly.. Music never seemed quite the same again... This is musical madness par excellance! ...Not to mention the lyrics, which, even though they at first glance seem to be totally random, in fact are very heartfelt and infused with an delicious sense of surreal humour.  MASTERPIECE!!
B00005ASOC|5.0|One of the few films I have left recently glad I spent the money! Too bad there were not a few car crashes, shoot-em-up scenes so that my sons would want to see it! <br />Through a chance encounter, the young man from the South Bronx, and the recluse from two or three decades earlier become friends. Interestingly, it is hard to judge who benefits the most from this unusual friendship, which in spite of the differences, grows into one of mutual respect.<br />Sean Connery can do very little wrong, and this to me is his best role since the award winning performance as the seasoned old Chicago cop in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; He is perfectly cast as Forrester. Another reviewer was correct: he really has to work at letting the tough exterior(hiding all manner of bizarre vulnerabilities) break down, and when he does, we see the maturation of a grown man just beginning become open to the trust in, reliance upon and assistance to his newfound friend. <br />The film has several high points, not the least of which is the well deserved come-uppance Connery gives F. Murray Abraham (who is splendidly cast as a jerk of an English teacher who accuses Robert Brown of plagiarism). This is most reminiscent (to me) of the similar scene with Al Pacino from &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, but Connery has so much more power (enough which spares him the need to shout) in this dramatic display of friendship. Ditto the scene at Yankee Stadium where we first see how much Brown's character Jamaal does for Connery's Forrester. <br />I was pleased to see this film avoid the cliches that Hollywood cannot seem to resist when attempting t portray young African Americans. Additionally, I was pleased not to see the interplay with Anna Paquin (the eager young prep school girl with the &quot;concerned&quot; father) turn to the inevitable sex/race clash.<br />As another said, this is a must see for people (not just  children) who have trouble coming to grips with any on a number of God given abilities. <br />This film was much to good for the lack of popular appeal it experienced, and is far too good to let go by. No heart pounding action, and nothing to maker the viewer jump up and high five the next person. There were sure a bunch of pretty pleased looking folks leaving the theatre, though.
B000002OTL|5.0|Vocal tracks, instrumentals and dialogue excerpts smoothly blended into the mix--like Vincent (John Travolta) telling Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) about a recent encounter with a \\"Royale with Cheese,&quot; French for a MacDonald's Quarter Pounder.  The soundtracks to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction follow-up, Jackie Brown, and Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels follow the same M.O., but this is the pick of the litter.<br />Favorite tracks include Dick Dale's surf classic, \\"Miserlou\\" (now inextricably linked with the film), Kool and the Gang's \\"Jungle Boogie\\" (\\"Get down, get down\\") and Dusty Springfield's \\"Ode to Bobby Joe\\"-ish, \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\" (originally written for Aretha Franklin and later recorded by The Diva after she heard Ms. Springfield's slinky \\"Dusty in Memphis\\" take on the tune).<br />The soundtrack may even be better than the movie, which is saying a lot.  Mr. Tarantino would make a fine club DJ, should this auteur thing ever fizzle out.
B000006MS3|3.0|Steady on, people. The Dreaming is a good album, and Kate Bush's necessary first step away from the traditional piano-and-voice style which had characterized her first three albums. But although it is good... how can I put this? It's just not THAT good. Her usual flair for melody almost disappears down a dark alleyway of drum machines and Rolf Harris, and whilst the sound-collage effects and heavy beats certainly have a compelling power, they are just the rehearsals for the far more accomplished pieces which would make up the first side of Hounds of Love three years later. <br />That's not to put this album down, though: it's innovative, always creative and certainly dark and sensuous. On side two it gets really strong: the title track, Night of the Swallow, All the Love and Houdini is a magnificent suite of songs. The problem is that there was another album released exactly at the same time as this one: Security, Peter Gabriel's fourth album, took the same basic building blocks of drum machines, intensely dark moods and ethnic rhythms and created a masterpiece that pushes The Dreaming firmly into second place. Get both - your musical knowledge is incomplete without them.
B00004STPT|5.0|Beautiful, grandiose, descriptive, seductive, hypnotic and moving; these are all words befitting to describe the Gladiator OST. So what if Zimmer &quot;borrows&quot; from Richard Wagners &quot;Gtterdammerung&quot; and Gustav Holsts &quot;The planets&quot;, because all is forgiven when it is done to underline the films storyline in the best possible way, which it most certainly does! The &quot;humming&quot; of ex.-Dead Can Dance vocal-goddess Lisa Gerrard in some sequences is just that little EXTRA icing on the cake to make the Gladiator OST worthy of my 5th rating star! I thought the Bram Stokers Dracula OST by Kilar would be the best soundtrack, I would ever come across, but... I STAND CORRECTED!
B000059Z8J|5.0|What a great movie. It is an epic, and the pretenders which have come in its wake pale in comparison. Another reviewer opines that this is but only &quot;one of the best adaptations of a comic book&quot;. It is more hopeful than the incredibly dark Batman series. I, for one have never seen better in this genre, and defy anyone to come up with its equal. <br />You don't have to have Seinfeld's enthusiasm for Superman to find some magic in this movie. One word dominates the adjectives many reviewers use : Spirit. It is a joy to watch.<br />This story from the DC Comics is thankfully restored to its original glory by director Richard Donner, who indeed does have an incredibly command of the story-telling ability necessary to compress the whole Superman story into two and a half hours. Donner has us hooked from the wonderful opening: We see a young child (who could be any of us) reading from the opening pages of the original 1938 Action Comics issue that launched The Man Of Steel. Then we see over The Daily Planet building from that same period. <br />The restored footage is superb, and should never have come out. The additional time on Krypton, as well as the entry into Lex Luthor's lair would have been well worth keeping in the original, and it is nice to see them restored. Seeing Noel Neill and Kirk Alyn (meaningful to those of us who remember &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; from television) on the train Superboy runs past is a nice touch, showing homage to the series.<br />There are a whole host of other wonderful little touches. We expect nothing less than to see young Clark Kent eating Cheerios back in Smallville. The dialogue is as snappy as the prose Perry White extols. Wonderful is the scene of Superman's arrival in Metropolis. The helicopter crashes, and Clark Kent looks for a place to change. He walks up to what used to be a phone booth (now, in the late 1970's two pieces of plexiglas open to all) and seeing no place to change, his look says &quot;damn&quot;. Then, the greatest compliment of all from a local pimp (the first earthling to see him in costume): &quot;Say, Jim, that's a BAD out-fit!&quot; When Superman catches a falling Lois Lane and reassures her of her safety, she has a great line: &quot;You've got me, but who's got YOU&quot;.<br />Wonderful supporting work by all. Ned Beatty does great work as bumbling sidekick Otis, and Jackie Cooper is Perry White. However, the award for first among equals must go to Gene Hackman, who showed his versatility as Lex Luthor, The Greatest Criminal Mind Of Our Time. His lines, looks and attitude are worth the price of the disc.<br />So what if a few of the plot turns were implausible! Yeah, I guess one could not reverse the earth's rotation backwards, and thereby make time go in reverse. Maybe one cannot &quot;seal&quot; the San Andreas Fault. But what the hell, if you can suspend your imagination to the point of a flying man, why not cover these little tricks too? And if you cannot suspend your imagination, this is not the movie to see.<br />For the rest of us, happily not so afflicted, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours.
0875428940|5.0|As I do in all my reviews of tarot products, I'd like to first assure the reader that I am not what you would call a regular practicioner of the tarot.  I collect and use the cards as a hobby, to provide perspective when I am facing a difficult decision, or simply to relax. When I first got involved in the tarot, it was shortly after I had finished reading the Illuminatus! trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, and I wanted to investigate some of the things discussed therein.  Since Crowley had been mentioned several times in the writing, I gravitated towards the Thoth deck, and it very nearly scared me away from the hobby entirely.  While I can now appreciate some of the symbolism of the art in that deck, it's certainly a little too intimidating for the beginner to pick up and try to learn. Fortunately, I didn't give up, and the next deck that I tried was the Robin Wood.  I can't say enough good things about this deck.  There are two reasons why there are so many tarot decks in print--the first is that there is a group of people who collect them, and that market is apparently substantial enough to support prices.  The second reason, however, is that many people have a hard time finding a deck that &quot;speaks&quot; to them.  This deck is that one for me, and, I think, for a lot of people. The imagery in this deck is clear and the illustrations are done exquisitely.  Relating to this deck shouldn't be a challenge for anybody.  If even a person like me, who is so put off by the overly pagan influence in the tarot, can relate to these cards, which confess to a certain degree of pagan influence, I think just about anybody should be able to find something for themselves in this deck.  This is a wonderful pack to start with, and one that has enough maturity to stay with a person for their entire life. That's not to say that there aren't a couple of problems that might come up.  For one thing, if you're thinking about reading for clients, you may want to avoid this deck for those more sensitive to nudity.  While all are tastefully done, there is a pretty fair amount running about in the deck.  The coloring on the images also does tend to lean a little in the positive direction, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.  There have been a couple of objections by reviewers here regarding the more positive feel of these cards, in fact, but I don't think there's any real grounding in that objection.  The traditionally negative cards still hold all the negative imagery and connotations--the three of swords is basically a redrawing of the original Rider-Waite design, and the ten of swords loses none of its threat either. Overall, there's really not much of a downside to this deck, from what I can tell.  I can shuffle the cards easily, and they've held up well for me, both materially and in utility.  This deck, in my opinion, is a must have for any novice reader of the tarot, and a welcome addition to any more advance user's collection.
B00000JPH6|4.0|This Henson masterpiece deserves to be released on DVD-Video.<br />Finally seeing this movie in its original aspect-ratio is the primary advantage of this release of the film.  (To my knowledge, it has never been available on VHS in its original format.)  Additionally, the disc contains many valuable bonus features, including behind-the-scenes documentaries, an isolated musical score, and deleted scenes.  The content of this product is very complete and satisfying to anyone who loves this film.<br />One of the chief characteristics of DVD (!!DIGITAL!! Video Disc), is its high-resolution and consequential picture and sound fidelity.  I would have expected that, with the transition of the film to DVD, the pulishers would have the decency to give it the ol' buff  and polish.  While the sound seems to be quite flawless, the picture is not.  Tell-tale dirt and grime intrude upon many frames, just as if the viewer were watching it at the movie theatre with its dusty projector.<br />Admittedly, I am unaware of the specific costs and benefits of film restoration; maybe George Lucas restored the Star Wars Trilogy because he is rich and loves his creation--and Star Wars has (as of the date of this review) only VHS availability!  I would have gladly paid an additional ten or fifteen dollars for The Dark Crystal to be restored to its original glory.<br />This issue of restoration is my only reason for NOT rating The Dark Crystal (DVD) as a five-star product.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Imagine being 16 again. Imagine getting a car, having all that freedom. And imagine being with that first love, your high school sweet heart. Then throw in this album and try to not get lost in the music. Try to not choke up a little bit. Try to not be completely taken back to those days and remember all that feeling and all that emotion. I'm very sure you can't. And you know what, I think thats exactly what Brian Wilson set out to do with this album, and my what a job he did with it.<br />I am 16, I do have my first car, and I am spending all my time with my first love. And I absolutely did love every single track on this record and alomst felt as though the whole thing was written just for us, just about us. I listened to this album for the first time, called up my girlfriend that night and told her it was the best album I ever heard, just because its just a collection of great love songs. She called me a nerd for it, but later did, in a serious way, tell me that it was cute. But who couldn't fall for this collection of &quot;sappy love songs&quot;.<br />Brian Wilson, when writing this album, essentially wanted to re-write everything we knew about rock 'n' roll music in this time. The Beatles had just released &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, which hit Brian Wilson so square in the heart that it is what inspired this masterpiece. But this was, in my opinion, the first, and greatest, concept album of all time. Forget &quot;Seagent Peppers...&quot; as the first. When you listen to this, you will realize that The Beatles were only elaborating on what Brian Wilson did. Many may be shocked to find out that it just wasn't John, Paul, George, and Ringo that came up with the idea for a concept album, but rather the humble and yet ambitious Brian Wilson of the misunderstood Beach Boys.<br />I say misunderstood, because when a friend of mine told another friend of mine that two popular music magizes selected this album as the greatest album of all time, he was shocked, appauled, and would have nothing to do with actually believing this. But this was not fun in the sun with good looking beach girls. This was love, and maturation. This was life. And this was Brian Wilson's ultimate gift to music, from him to you. And it was the greatest gift any true music fan will ever recieve.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Ditto what that other reviewer said: this is another great Harrison Ford vehicle. They really DON'T make movies like this any more.  It needs not typical DVD additions, not cut scenes, not trailers, or interviews.<br />Back in the day, Wednesday morning school was dominated by the discussion of the latest episode of &quot;The Fuge&quot; from the night before. This is the only film I can think of which actually did justice to the classic television show from which it sprang. <br />Tommy Lee Jones is a fantastic U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard. He appears not to be obsessed with the capture of Dr. Kimble (as was his television predecessor, portrayed by Barry Morse). Nonetheless, we get the feeling that he brings the same determination to every case he has. Ford once again is the &quot;everyman&quot; (if a doctor who gets sent to prison for killing his wife and then escapes can be thought of in those terms) who prevails through all manner of adversities. [As an aside, I wonder how well Ford could stretch himself - could he ever be convincing as a real bad guy, like a John Malkovich or Anthony Hopkins?]<br />This movie has a lot of pluses. It is a great story, updated from one of the sixties' best shows.  Sure, there were great stunts. The bus crash/train wreck was stunning (made even more so by seeing Ford almost comically hobbling along, trying to outrun the carnage while wearing leg shackles).<br />However, it is the competition between the two dogged adversaries Jones and Ford that makes this work. They are one real pair of incredibly strong personalities- (and screen presences) Nothing better than the sequence in the dam early on with Ford protesting his innocence and Jones equally sincere reply &quot;I don't care&quot;. Both smart, even though Jones hides his behind a gruff and self-deprecating exterior. The good and decent Doc must be determined (after all, it is his can on the line), but seeing him persevere - hiding his own persona in a hospital, evading the police while tracking down the one armed man is intense, even though we know the outcome. <br />Great editing; especially when we think the Marshals are getting close to the big bust, and we find out that they are actually making a collar across town. <br />This one is a winner.
B000056K04|4.0|I was introduced to DMB a couple of years ago, it was the Live from Red Rocks album. Brought it back to Europe and played it over and over again. Later I bought Crash and Under the Table and Dreaming, so good you play it over and over again. Heard I Did It on national radio (first time I've ever heard DMB on the radio in Denmark)and the impression was that Everyday is more mainstream than previous albums and the texts aren't as deep and thoughtful as previously. He doesn't play with the words the way he used to, maybe because he doesn't write them himself. Everyday is in my opinion not nearly as timeless as previously released albums, but still way better than most other albums out there.
0441172717|5.0|If you are intimidated by what you've heard about Dune, pay it no mind. Never before, even in the works of Tolkien has such a detailed and intricate world been created within the pages of the book. Arrakis and the world surrounding it is as real as our own as told through the cryptic yet poetic words of author Frank Herbert.<br />So much can be said for what this book symbolizes. Not only does it take modern religions and translate them to the 110th century, not only does it argue philosophically with the nature of war, not only does it show fascism, communism, oligarchism and democracy in truly creative lights, but it also is one of the greatest adventure stories ever written. Paul and Jessica's journey through the desert (and eventually the Fremen way of life) will keep you interested the whole way through. It is a page turner until the very last page.<br />Pick up the original Dune - and when you're done with that, read the next two. The three after that aren't for all tastes, but they too enrich the original even further (as do the prequels). And whatever you do - DON'T watch that god-awful 1984 movie version. If you really must watch one before you read the book, pick up the DVD of the 2000 Sci-fi miniseries. It doesn't have fantastic production values (... for 4 1/2 hours doesn't look great) but it's heart is in the right place. But I'm wandering. Go by the bloody book.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is a great CD to own.  Each track is different the Cd keeps flowing.  Also the lyrics does have some foul language but nothing like some of the other groups out thier.
B00003CXE6|4.0|Okay, let's get the facts straight: GLADIATOR is a really good movie that had been very overhyped. The background of the film was specatcular, though I do think they went a little overboard with the setting, and the special effects/sound effects were amazing, too. After all, when my parents rented this video (they had turned up the volume, of course), I could hear the sound perfectly and clearly all the way upstairs in my closed bedroom! Talk about excellent sound effects.<br />The acting was pretty supurb, too. Especially Russell Crowe. And I think he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. Well...it's actually kind of hard to tell (especially that &quot;affair&quot; he had with actress Meg Ryan!). The action is awesome, too. But some of the Oscars I don't believe this film should have won. Sometimes, I believe the only reason this film won all those Oscars was because it was so overhyped and it hit big in the box office. But flat out, good film and definitely one that shouldn't be missed. I really enjoyed it and it gives accurate historical events and the setting and costumes make you feel like you've actually traveled back in time during the Roman Empire.<br />Still, this film doesn't top my list of favorite films of 2000. Some of the other 2000 films that I enjoyed a lot more were ALMOST FAMOUS, BILLY ELLIOT, and CAST AWAY. It would probably be in my honorable mentions list. But GLADIATOR is definitely worth your money and you definitely have got to see this film!
078062582X|2.0|Demi Moore as a stripper.  Burt Reynolds in a satirical role as a politician with a few screws loose.  Smooth and rhythmic sounds from Annie Lennox.  What more could you ask for?  How about a film that doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewing public.  I guess that would be too much to ask.<br />The movie is almost B grade but the performances of Reynolds and Armand Assante in particular manage to keep this film from totally going in the toilet.<br />Watching Demi was a REAL THRILL!  Unfortunately though that was about all there is.
B000059XUI|5.0|I love the Superman movies and cannot wait till it comes out on DVD, May 1st. This happens to be one of my favorite Superman movies of all time. It is better than the first one because in the first one of the beginning it runs a little slow because of the Krypton scene. I hate that scene but the scenary is pretty nice. Do not see the third and fourth one because those are the worse ones. Stick with one and two they are great! The only thing bad about Superman on DVD is that they don't have the new scenes during the movie I thought they will. They only have them with the features of the deleted scenes which makes me a little disappointed but I'll deal with it. Because I have all Superman movies on video and I am selling them all to get the collection on DVD. Even though if I only like the first two I would like to own them all on DVD so it can be a collection. Thanks to the DVD industry and Warner Bros. As I said stick with one and two do not see three and four they suck!
6301016289|5.0|First off I definitely don't view Gordon Gecko (GG) as either a sinner or a saint.  In my mind there is considerable merit in much of the wisdom that GG espouses.  One of my favorite lines from the film has to be when Buddy (Charlie Sheen) asks GG 'What about hard work?'  Gecko's response is right on the money and histerical at the same time.  Gecko's ethics may be lacking but his sense of what is truly reality in our society is absolutely correct and should be pondered and learned from.<br />And then you have the contrast of Martin Sheen's character who is just your average typical hard working blue collar guy (commendable).  But he like so many others like him is at the mercy of the true powers that be.  THERE IS A HAPPY MEDIUM BETWEEN THE TWO. Each has its own merits. That is what I personally strive for.<br />Charlie Sheen is fabulous.  He displays so much honesty in every scene whether it's snorting coke with a hooker, schmoozing secretaries to gain entrance, or utter deflation as he is being arrested.  Michael Douglas gives one of my favorite performances ever.<br />It's a real thrill to see the hope and naive exuberance of youth be contrasted with stark reality of truth.<br />One of my top 10 favorite films of all time.
630522577X|3.0|Harrison is excellent, so is Hepburn. Fun for all. The only thing that really upsets me is they should have used Julie Andrews since she did it on the stage(Not knocking Hepburns performance). Also Hepburn did not sing anything, all her singing was dubbed by someone else. Julie would have sung them all herself. That said, the movie still is a joy!
0786915749|5.0|From the fist page to the last, every single character, every single villan, every single battle and adventure is just marevelous, there are just very few books that can include fantasy, romance, adventure, personal conflicts, real character interactions in which each of their decisions and actions have an impact on the rest of them and the story as a whole. You'll just get thrilled with this great fantasy novel and you won't stop reading it until you're done, and I guarantee it will be no more than a couple of days.
B000004727|5.0|Paco de Lucia's name will stand as one of the innovators in flamenco guitar, along with other greats like Ramon Montoya and Sabicas, and being an innovator, he will be subject to adoration as well as to harsh criticism. When Ramon Montoya brought flamenco guitar to the stage front early in the last century,  all traditionalists screamed: no, no, the guitar is for accompaniment only! When Paco de Lucia introduced new harmonies and new instruments into flamenco, purists were disgusted. Now, those then-new harmonies are accepted into the flamenco dictionary, and the cajón (a south American percussion instrument that Paco brought into flamenco use only a few decades ago) is considered a \\"very\\" flamenco instrument and is being used almost universally in the art form.<br />No one will ever be able to deny the great importance this one man has had on the development and the appreciation of the flamenco guitar, yes, of flamenco and of guitar music in general. An innovator will tread where others have not gone, and therefore will always be one step ahead of everyone else. And for that reason will be often misunderstood, certainly by those who cling to forms from the times that they themselves started appreciating flamenco.<br />Paco de Lucia has for the past 50 years devoted his life to the flamenco guitar and culture. While other mortals spent time with their families, Paco was spreading the word on his culture, and defending flamenco against prejudice that classified it as \\"music of the street\\". He would come back from a US tour, looking forward to spending three days over Christmas with his family before flying off to Argentina, only to learn that there was TV and press-conference duty that reduced his time off to ... three hours. To us, the audience, he gave his huge and incredible work output, both recorded, and on the concert stage. It has been a sacrifice, to gain appreciation for his beloved flamenco.<br />To me, his finest albums, the ones that I most recommend, are: \\"Almoraima\\" (1976), \\"Siroco\\" (1988) and \\"Luzia\\" (1998). Of those three to my ears, Almoraima is the first album in which Paco really outlines his signature unorthodox approach: the Alegría with the choir, the use of an oud (Arab lute), the deliberate build-up of the album as a whole, yes indeed the production (unheard of!). His albums up until this one had consisted of superior guitar playing, but in other people's mold. Here, Paco creates his own terrain, and that of many guitarists to follow. A gem, a jewel of a work where I cannot find a bad or overlooked moment.<br />After this, Paco comes out with extraordinary albums like \\"Solo Quiero Caminar\\" and many others, in which he explores his boundaries and does some of his best playing, but always in a jazzier context.<br />Then, he releases \\"Siroco\\": an album of so much purity, that it almost feels as if you are \\"there\\", listening to Paco play in an intimate setting. The first time I heard \\"Siroco\\" was in a very impersonal big department store in Córdoba. Tears streamed over my face during the opening song: I forgot totally where I was and let me be grabbed by this beautiful guitar playing. Well over a decade of listening to this album have not diminished its enchantment. This is to where the flamenco guitar had developed: the master first learned how to play traditionally, took an experimental and then jazzy approach, and now came back, enriched, to the roots to make a profound statement of what could be done within this traditional yet totally new idiom.<br />Other, younger players stood up and gave Paco a run for his money. We heard the records and concerts of people like Gerardo Nuñez, Cañizares, Tomatito, and of course Vicente Amigo, and these guitar players, who started with the level and musicianship of Paco as the leading example, and current trend, of course developed it further, and impressed us all. And, well, Paco surely was resting on his laurels. Wrong. Out comes \\"Luzia\\". It is as if Paco de Lucia wanted to set the record straight: who exactly is the master of flamenco guitar? This is an album by a mature player who is in total control of both his instrument and his idiom of choice. Gone is the youthful exploration of \\"Almoraima\\", and in comes a statement so profound and personal it is almost frightening. Paco sings (!) of how his friend and long-time collaborator, gypsy singer El Camaron, has been taken away from his side (Cameron died in 1992). There are two bulerias on this cd that are so flawlessly filled with new and exciting material it is frightening. A solea that has melodies straddling the traditional compas in a way that had never been done before and yet makes total sense; a siguiryias that builds like a classical composition.... All right, the Alegría seems a reworking of that on \\"Siroco\\" (but just as great), and the Tangos (with Duquende singing) sounds a little too easy-listening to me, but all-in-all this ranks in my world as the definitive Paco de Lucia-album.<br />To anyone who is in doubt whether to buy \\"Almoraima\\", \\"Siroco\\" or \\"Luzia\\", my honest advice is: skip dinner and buy all three.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Powerful guitar riffs with beautiful female vocals? I didn't think it was possible either, until I started listening to Oceanborn. I'm simply amazed!<br />Much of the sound on this album is reminiscent of Finnish neoclassical power metal bands like Children of Bodom and Stratovarius, especially with the heavy emphasis on keyboard work. However, Tarja's vocals and Tuomas's beautifully-written melodies take Nightwish far and beyond any typical power metal!<br />Every track on this album is excellent! You MUST listen to the second song (Gethsemane) -- it is simply fantastic and beautiful! The third song (Devil and the Deep Blue Ocean) has an unusual twist with interspersed death-metal style backing vocals.<br />On a side note, I am hoping that this album attracts more female fans to the vast and diverse heavy metal genre (even though I happen to be male). The American &quot;nu-metal&quot; market has largely turned off female fans with their bad vocals and crude cliches, and it is refreshing to see a band like Nightwish add classy female vocals to music that is already great.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit has outdone themselves this time !!  this album is a masterpiece .. i'm probably the only person that actually says something good about this album. I know a lot of people hate it but i don't care if they don't like it . I praise Fred and the rest of Limp Bizkit .   P.S.  FRED IS GOD !!
B00000JJQK|5.0|I agree with many who say you must evaluate each artist unto themselves and not compare &quot;apples to oranges&quot; but this LP/CD invites comparison by being incomparible.  Of course that doesn't make sense, but that's the point...this is an emotional issue so I'm going to make this review from deep inside with my own emotional being!<br />I am old enough to remember this LP when it first came out in all of it's monophonic glory.  My brother and I had been Beach Boy fans since 1962/63 and followed their music religiously.  As we lie in bed every night we would listen to different artists, different albums almost every night...falling asleep to their hits and misses as most LP's of the time seldom showed any consistency from one tune to the other.  <br />Then the night came in 1966 when my brother came home from his job with the new Pet Sounds lp he had bought.  I can't remember how many nights that was the only album to guide us to sleep...but I know it was well over a year...without a break!  From the first time I heard it, there was something magic in those grooves.  Brian was talking directly to me in his music and words.  He tugged at my anticipation of growing older with songs about loss...loss of innocence, loss of love, loss of friends...all warning me of what growing up would do to my heart and soul.  Brian provided this musical backdrop that featured humourous snips of sounds that didnt' seem like they should fit but ironically made the overall feel of the music DEEPER in retrospect.  The sound of a bicycle bell, the squeek of a horn, all woven in the tapestry of angst...although I had no idea what that meant, I did know how it felt.  <br />I ached night after night at the desperate emptiness of Caroline No...followed by the sound of a train moving away and Banana and Louie barking their heads off wondering if I would ever feel that lonely in my lifetime, somehow knowing Brian knew I would.<br />Each song has an emotional resonance about it that is so personal, as if Brian were speaking to me directly in every line, with every tempo, with every voice he directed, that I felt then and still feel today, that Brian wrote Pet Sounds specifically for ME!  Listen to it and you will most likely feel the very same way!<br />After seeing Brian perform Pet Sounds Live last summer with my brother, (it was his 54th birthday present from me), I can honestly say I have lived a full life and have witnessed two amazing feats...Pet Sounds the Album and Pet Sounds the Tour, I can die now...I've reached VALHALLA!<br />OGIE
B000053V7Q|4.0|The only reason I give this version four stars instead of 5 is because many of the original songs are missing. I assume at some point after the legal hassels that there will be a part two to this. I can't believe that many of the reviewers like the original version better, it contained interviews with completely unknown (not to mention strange and weird) people, the overall quality was poor and grainy, angle shots were bad and the sound sucked. Sorry guys, this new versions is by far the best!
6305307261|5.0|This movie is often seen on IFC at least once every 2 months.  Gripping and frightening.  A bit strange, but if you are familiar with foreign movies, it suddenly becomes alot less strange.  You can feel for the characters, and the actress who plays Lucy is very sexy and charming.  The make-up on Nosferatu is astounding, he is frightening to look at and his skeletal movements and girations will make you jump!  Definitely a great example of foreign ingenuity.
B000002KXO|3.0|As much as I would like to support this album more, it  seems clear to me that &quot;Mirage&quot; is below the standard set by the group's late 70s releases and the beginning of their slide into mediocrity.  This is not to say that the album is not pleasurable--even though the songs are largely uninspired, the production touches, group harmonies and playing keep things listenable.  And each writer manages to come up with at least one gem: Nicks' sublime &quot;Gypsy&quot;, McVie's lilting &quot;Only Over You&quot; and Buckingham's sharp &quot;Eyes Of The World&quot; remind one of what these people are actually capable of. The rest of the platter is diverse but mostly minor; the jaunty country-pop &quot;That's Alright&quot; (actually a song written way back in '74) sits next to the 50s throwbacks &quot;Can't Go Back&quot; and &quot;Oh Diane&quot;, and then there's two catchy/fluffy McVie hits (&quot;Love In Store&quot;, &quot;Hold Me&quot;) to round things out. This album has most of the ingredients which made &quot;Fleetwood<br />Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot; essential, except the two most important-- the emotional and lyrical edge.  So what one gets instead is a by-the-numbers FM work, which proved that the group could still entertain under these circumstances but was not  an encouraging harbinger of things to come.  Thus, while aspects of the album remain underrated--and there are always those three top-drawer tracks to mull over--&quot;Mirage&quot; deserves most of the underwhelmed reaction of its critics.
B00004RF98|5.0|Probably repetitious...but this is a joyous film...so much can be said about this, truly a valentine to old hollywood(may I also suggest the Kaufman and Hart play...Once in a lifetime) ...fabulous Kelly work, Masterful Stanley Donen direction alongside of Kelly.  Great music...but here are the unsung heroes..............................Donald O&quot; Connor.........Jean Hagen......and the incredible Comden and Green screenplay.  This is a hilarious film.  Even if you think you won't like thiis, or you know this...check it out.  What a glorious feeling....Watch it and get happy again.
B000002KD5|5.0|It's impossible to overestimate the impact this album--which came out of virtually nowhere back in 1975--would have, not only with regards to Fleetwood Mac as a band but the musical climate of the late 70s in general.  In retrospect, its stunning commercial and artistic success should have been easy to predict: its predecessors were, after all, the  excellent &quot;Buckingham/Nicks&quot; and &quot;Mystery To Me&quot; albums, although both works were largely unknown at the time.  However, when this magical tenth lineup of the group did finally did coalesce at the beginning of '75, its very first product sounded fully formed, as if the bandmembers had been playing together for years.  To their credit, the remarkable rhythm section of  Fleetwood/McVie (who *had* been playing together since 1967) kept things grounded, and when listening to the album for the millionth time it is their contributions which stand out more and more.  <br />Christine McVie, who had gradually established herself as the group's most reliable songwriter on the previous three albums, contributed three of her best songs to date (&quot;Warm Ways&quot;, &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;); her even- tempered voice and the delicacy of the arrangements (a banjo lick here, an answering piano flourish there) makes these simple pop songs sound so much more sincere.  However, such triumphs actually take a backseat on &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; to the contributions of the two new members.  Buckingham's &quot;Monday Morning&quot;, &quot;World Turning&quot; and &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; were instant classics and strong live setpieces, the latter two in particular being greatly expanded on stage into intense, emotionally supercharged jamming warhorses.  And then of course there's Stevie Nicks, already at the peak of her powers and ready to take on the world with the signature works &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Crystal&quot;.  It is almost impossible for FleetwoodMac/Nicks fans to imagine a world without these three songs, so powerful has been their impact over the years; &quot;Crystal&quot; is my personal favorite, a track which begins as a graceful folk number that climaxes in extraordinary harmonies and then fades out to a magical, flowing keyboard solo set against a waterfall backdrop of acoustic guitars.  The effortless blend of pop and rock, the mastery of a diverse range of styles within the two ranging from country folk to blues to prog, the presence of three incredibly gifted songwriters with distinctive styles and the subsequent rash of mega-success all combined to give the group the crown of 70s Beatles.  The only weak track is &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;, a bit of tossed-off McVie filler that is still OK.  &quot;Rumours&quot; followed soon after, and while one may debate which album is superior, it's kind of like debating whether &quot;Revolver&quot; is better than &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot;, which is probably the highest compliment a group can recieve.
B00003CXLF|4.0|Ron Howard's directing at its best -- Jim Carrey seems to have found a role where he doesn't seem annoying. I was impressed by his acting, the set, and even little Cindy-Loo-Who. In addition, this movie has a great soundtrack. I plan on watching this every Christmas for years to come!
B000002IOW|4.0|Rush was once one of the most important bands in my life. Along with Jethro Tull, they really accounted for most of the music I listened to in high school. My tastes have since changed, matured and broadened. I've also become pretty much of an audio-geek, obssesed with soundstaging, &quot;air&quot;, spatial cues, etc. The testament to this album's greatness is the fact that I've loved it since the day it came out and still listen to it all the time. The first thing that sets it apart from Rush's previous work is the more dynamic, open sound. Not everything sounds smashed together. It also avoids sounding too slick and just comes across as a great, almost raw, full-band sound. Not quite audiophile caliber, but definitely easy on the ears. The lyrics are among Rush's best, not over-the-top but still sufficently fantastical and scientific. Imagine an album full of songs on the level of &quot;time stand still&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; and you'll get the idea. The playing is, of course, insanely good. And you can hear every nuance thanks to a perhaps overly detailed full-digital recording (DDD). You can really hear why these guys are considered musician's musicians. the rhythmic interplay between Peart and Lee is probably some of the most complex ever committed to tape. The songs structures are particually interesting, almost funk-influenced. They really break out of the sameness that mars much of their work. The title track is a standout, moving from accoustic passages to funky interludes and mingling with soaring lead electric work. &quot;Available light&quot; is another stunner, and &quot;The Pass&quot; has one of the most addictive openings I've ever heard. These days, it's the only Rush album I ever listen to all the way through.
0792838084|5.0|David Lynch in this film is typically himself : initiation of young people to the dark side of society, the rotten apples in the police institution, the artistic cult of darkness in the pictures, suffering as a lifestyle for some women who accept it and long for it essentially, but also for some social bullies who are criminals and traffickers and who enjoy inflicting that suffering on anyone at hand. And you add a love affair between two of these young people and the pipcture is nearly complete. The last element is the liaison between the young man and the woman-victim of the violence and it introduces us to the impulse that pushes aside the refusal to be violent in sex and that engulfs the young man into being violent against his own rational will. This is the best element in the film : violence comes from a deeply-rooted impulse and cannot be evaded in some situations produced by society. The last touch of David Lynch's art is the slow motion of the film. And there you are with a cataclysmic denouement that brings both liberation and the pains of growth and the pains of the recollection after growing of these first pains. The butterfly remembers the chrysalid that remembers the larva that maybe ven remembers the egg. No escape from this truth : the child is the father of the man. The minutiae of the work of David Lynch, in this film or others, is a real pleasure in the moonshining process of distilling human emotions. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar,&quot; and while I love the original 1970 album, the 1973 movie version/soundtrack album is equally just as powerful. While the 1970 version remains the best &quot;Superstar&quot; recording in several ways, certainly in regards to production and sound quality, the 1973 movie version tops the original recording in one respect at least: it's the only COMPLETE version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar.&quot; The 1973 movie &amp; it's accompanying soundtrack album present &quot;Superstar&quot; in a wonderfully expanded version that actually builds on the amazing accomplishment that composer Andrew Lloyd Webber &amp; lyricist Tim Rice had already achieved with the landmark 1970 album.For the movie version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar,&quot; Lloyd Webber &amp; Rice had to write some extra material in order to beef up the film. The extra musical goodies they supplied include &quot;Then We Are Decided,&quot; a great song that the high priests Caiaphas &amp; Annas sing, in which they contemplate in private their plans against Jesus. This song is a great addition to the opera, as it delves a bit deeper into these two characters &amp; their motives. That it's almost never performed in any stage production of &quot;Superstar&quot; these days is a very sad ommission. &quot;Then We Are Decided,&quot; in my opinion, SHOULD be a part of all future &quot;Superstar&quot; recordings and performances. But for now, it's only available on the movie soundtrack.Other bonus material include an extra lyric for Jesus to sing in &quot;Hosanna,&quot; the lovely Mary &amp; Peter duet &quot;Could We Start Again Please?&quot; (which IS included in most of the recent &quot;Superstar&quot; productions, thankfully), and last but not least, a dramatic, extended version of the &quot;Trial Before Pilate&quot; that greatly improves on the shorter, original version. The original &quot;Trial&quot; is fine, but there's a LOT more conflict &amp; drama between Pilate &amp; the crowd in the extended &quot;Trial,&quot; as Pilate is shown greatly wrestling with his own conscience over what his final decision on Jesus' fate should be. It's a very powerful moment, indeed. Once again, I'm glad that many productions of &quot;Superstar&quot; lately DO incorporate the extended version of the &quot;Trial.&quot;You get a marvelous cast that includes brilliant vocal turns by Ted Neely, Carl Anderson, and Yvonne Elliman in their respective roles of Jesus, Judas, and Mary, and, of course, the classic music &amp; lyrics by Lloyd Webber &amp; Rice, performed here with great passion by the assembled musicians, almost just as good as on the original &quot;Superstar&quot; album. The sound quality, however, isn't all that spectacular---it sounds like everyone is singing through a telephone line! (Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit). But nonetheless, the performances are first-rate, and so is the music. In the end, this is an excellent version of this legendary rock opera, and it's the ONLY version of the musical that's 100% complete. Personally, I suggest buying BOTH the movie soundtrack of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and the original 1970 version, too. They compliment each other very well, and they're the only recordings of &quot;Superstar&quot; you'll ever need to own.ilate &amp; the crowd in the extended &quot;Trial,&quot; as Pilate is shown greatly wrestling with his own conscience over what his final decision on Jesus' fate should be.

6301247485|4.0|Okay, so even though I think the movie version of The Great Gatsby is by no means up to the standards of the book - it is still a decent movie.  Robert Redford plays Gatsby in a quiet, mysterious manner and although Mia Farrow goes a bit far in accentuating Daisy's ditzy behavior at times, she is still adequate in the part.  The musical score was dreamy and marvelous and actually won an academy award, but then when the movie was brought out on video they CHANGED this wonderful music.  I couldn't believe that the song &quot;What'll I do&quot; which is perfect for the scenes where Daisy and Gatsby are rekindling their love affair in a slow, delicous dance, was replaced by some nondescript, elevator music !!  What's the deal with that?<br />The book is a classic and definitely has a 3-hanky ending.  I think the ending scene in the movie version sticks close enough to that eerie feeling to be worth watching.  However I would remind viewers that the current version has a disappointing musical score and is not the haunting, original academy award-winner.
0399226907|5.0|I bought this book to my baby girl when she was 11-month old.  and found she loves all the tiny holes in the book.  She doesn't have much patient for the first few page, can't wait to turn to the apple, pears, plums...... The tiny holes are perfect for her tiny fingers.<br />The board book is perfectly designed.  It uses different sizes for different fruits.  Very attactive to the one-year old baby.
0553293397|5.0|Having successfully solved the murder of a Spacer on Earth, and thus prevented a disastrous punitive war, Elijah Baley is once again called upon for his investigative prowess.   Another Spacer has been murdered, but not on Earth this time, on the newest colonized Spacer world, Solaria.  Solaria is the antithesis of Earth, having a VERY lopsided robot to human ratio, while on Earth, robots are still despised and distrusted.  Teaming again with R. Daneel Olivew, his investigative partner from Caves of Steel, Baley must deal with not only his own aversion to the vast robot presence, but the frequent travels through the outdoors, which his agoraphobic mind can scarcely tolerate.  In addition is the nature of the Solarians, who have become so isolated from each other as to consider obscene the actual presence of humans.   Meeting resistance constantly, from the Solarians and from his own partner, Baley begins to see that the Solarian way is just as bad as the Earth way, where the people are not isolated from each other, but from the galaxy.  Eventually, after pursuing several wrong leads, Baley hits upon the truth, but it's not quite as one might expect. I highly recommend this as another great Asimov novel;  as part of the Robot-Empire-Foundation storyline, it's a very good part.
B00004XPP0|1.0|I would never give Star Wars 1 star...EVER.  However, enough is enough.  This trilogy is one of the greatest ever made, no doubt, but where is the DVD?  Star Wars has been re-released so many times, now we see George Lucas, not as a great director and story teller, but a business man who is just in this to make another buck.  Give us, the fans, a break.  Release these on DVD and stop wasting our time.  This new set features about ten minutes of useless EPISODE 2 footage, that tells us nothing {we already know its too soon to expect anything COOL}  So my advice is not to buy this one, unless your a die hard fan who wants to keep this one on the shelf.....WRAPPED of course.
B000007MVX|1.0|Finally I begin to understand.<br /><br />It is about 6 years now since I originally reviewed this album. At that time I criticized it as too impenetrable and too silly. I gave it one star. Although I can edit this review now, it seems I can't change the number of stars. I'm not sure what number to give anyway, with others in mind; the album is good, yet is almost impossible to understand. In fact, I know of one website devoted entirely to this single Jethro Tull album, and I think the folks there are considerably off the mark in interpreting it.<br /><br />The \\"Hare\\" story in the middle I believe is basically an intentional distraction, yet a sincere statement of libertarian convictions in itself. While I appreciate it, I wish my CD was set up so I could skip over it. I've heard the story enough times now.<br /><br />The rest of the album... Well, it may not be what it seems. A hint: forget the whole \\"play\\" thing, with it's various \\"acts.\\" That is just another red herring. Just pay attention to the music.<br /><br />I believe that this album is a camouflaged statement of philosophy -- perhaps the most daring philosophy a man can hold.
B00004XMTH|3.0|Make-up and costumes are great. Lots of dancing, some of it not so great for kids. If I never hear &quot;Memories&quot; again it will be much too soon. The T.S. Eliot book is better.
0451160916|5.0|Usually I am not a person who likes to read horror novels at all.  I avoid any kind of really scary book or movie.  But we got assigned to read this book for class and I figured, &quot;Hey, I'll give it a try.&quot;  We came to learn that there is more to the book and writing than just a bunch of scary events just meant to entertain.  Perhaps people never look beyond these events to see the thematic choices the writer has chosen to make.      I actually really enjoyed the book.  Yes, I was a bit scared in some parts (thank goodness I wasn't watching a movie of it), but there was a lot more depth to the book than I would have originally thought.      The novel starts off with this family, The Torrances.  The father, Jack had just gotten a job as a winter maintenence man for The Overlook Hotel.  We learn that Jack used to be an English teacher at a prep school and got fired and that this job is kind of a last resort for him.  His wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, don't really want to go to this isolated hotel for the winter, but they want to be supportive of Jack and so they agree.  Danny, however, is a different child than most, because he has &quot;the shine.&quot;  He begins to get bad feelings and visions from his friend, Tony, about this place. It is bad news.      As things happen at the hotel, we learn more about the history of this family.  We learn that Jack has a bit of a violent past, which has an effect on his relationship with his wife and son and was the cause for his termination at the prep school.  Jack tries to overcome this history, but certain events keep pushing it back in his face.  They drive wedges between Jack and Wendy.  Weird things begin to happen, scary things, and at first when Danny gets hurt, Wendy suspects Jack has done it to him.      Through the different scary events that begin to happen, we are able to see a distinct conflict and rising themes in the novel.  The conflict is between the Overlook and The Torrances.  This family is just trying to survive as a family and not break apart.  There is a theme of trying to overcome one's history, which, as I mentioned, we most obviously see through Jack.      This novel makes for a most interesting and suspenseful read.  I would definitely recommend it to others, because you keep flipping pages.  You don't want to put it down, and it keeps you wondering what's going to happen.  Who will win, the Overlook or the Torrances?
B000056NX4|3.0|This was my first time seeing any production of JCS, although I was familiar with the tunes that became radio hits. I think the sets and costumes detracted from the story--the graffiti scene at the beginning was so boring I almost turned it off. Some of the lyrics were difficult to understand, being drowned out by music--not that one might sing it at home, but you at least want to know what's being sung! Overall, vocal performances were very uneven, and while singers don't have to be operatic types (although it would help), they do need to have musical theater experience, and if they did, it did not come across as such here.<br />Glenn Carter reminded me an awful lot, lookswise of Jeffrey Hunter in King of Kings. I did not expect to be hearing a falsetto on Gethsemane(?), but that is what you get when you sing out of your range. Oddly enough, it seemed to fit in quite well with this production, it wasn't too out of place with all the other strange stuff going on. I did enjoy his performance overall.<br />Rik Mayall, fine as he is on the occasional Black Adder and that other show he is associated with (the name escapes me at this time) comes across looking like Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. The resemblance was uncanny. His singing talent--NOT!<br />Johanson as Pilate was one of the better singers. Owens, who played Caiaphas, seemed way out of his range at times, although he was certainly an imposing figure.<br />Finally, nothing about this version made me even come close to crying. There was too much going on with the weird sets and costumes, which detracted from the interesting music and the story itself. Cabaret meets A Clockwork Orange and 1984. A bit TOO much on the stylistic side. I will have to check out the original movie for comparison.<br />My advice is to watch this on PBS if they run it again, or rent it before you buy it, especially if you happen to be a fan of the original.
0140177396|4.0|John Steinbeck's novel &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is one of the best books I have read in a long while.  The setting of this story is in the south were racism and prejudices are just a way of life.  The story is about two men who are trying to reach their American dream of having their own house on there own land.  George is the smart one who act as an older sibling to Lennie, a man who is big and strong but has a heart of a four year old girl because he's mentally handicapped.  Throughout the novel George is constantly telling Lennie that he would be better of without him.  They eventually get to Tyler Ranch their new place of work.  While settling in there they make plans to buy the land and house with Candy, an old crippled man.  At the farm Lennie is treated with respect from everybody at the ranch except for the bosses son Curley.  While on the ranch Curley is always trying to stir things up with the workers, especially Lennie.  While the men are having a horseshoe tournament Lennie is inside the barn with the pup he want to get.  Throughout the book Lennie is constantly killing small animals on accident.  He eventually kills the pup, meanwhile Curleys wife who is a constant nuisance enters the barn and starts flirting with Lennie, while petting her hair Lennie gets frightened and incidentally snaps her neck and runs from the ranch as quick as possible. You must read the book to figure out what happens next. This is a heart-warming novel that once you start reading you wont put it down.  I recommend you read this book as soon as possible.

B00003CWL6|3.0|Lots has been said about this movie that I won't rehash here. I'll just say that I thought it was an interesting fable of materialism run amuck, and the consequences of such lives. <br />This movie has some dumb parts (the plastic bag) and can be a bit heavy-handed at times(How many saw the Marine's secret from a mile away?) but overall it was enjoyable.<br />There's something dark lurking behind the McMansions and the SUVs and the overprogrammed families that comprise so much of our middle class in the US. This film comes close to articulating that darkness.
0440224764|5.0|This book was so great I'm going to read it again. I couldn't put it down. In the beginning, when they caught Patrick, I thought it was going to be all about his trial. Instead, it was about how Patrick used his lawyer expertise to work his way out of spending even one night in jail. Sandy McDermott was one of my favorite characters because he worked so hard and put his life on hold to help Patrick. Also, I really liked Eva Miranda, through her love and commitment to Patrick, has taught me that no guy is that important to risk my life for. One of my least favorite characters was Trudy Lanigan because she is just too sleazy and she was not commited to her husband. I blame Trudy for Patrick's rebellion. Jack Stephano is not one of my favorites either, but he is a character that makes this story so interesting. When Patrick was being tortured, it made me extrememly angry. I wanted to run in and save him. Reading this novel has taught me that as long as you get an education and become good at what you do, then no one can walk all over you. This was truly a great book.
0920668372|1.0|This book is absolutely horrible for children! It's right up there with The Giving Tree in terms of giving kids a warped view of what real life and realtionships should be about. Nevermind that even the angles of the illustrations promote a feeling of sneakiness, nevermind that the mother's face is half hidden behind the bed as she's crouched stalking her sleeping child. Nevermind the fact that this woman is driving across town at midnight to break into her adult son's house and ordering him to come see him because she's old and sick... Not once, the entire time he's growing up, does she express this (obsessive) love she has for him during the day when he can be a part of it. That, I think, says it all. This is a book of pure nostalgia and it is meant for adults. By reading it to children you put the burden of love and codependence on them. That's not fair.
0380778556|5.0|You will like this book IF:  You like well written stories.  You enjoy real, not dippy, suspense.  You adore books with surprise twists.  You hate classics but read voraciously.<br />This book IS a classic, but if all classics were like THIS one, no one would fail high school English anymore.  The word choice is fantastic.  The story evolves with such sophistication, it happens almost without the reader's awareness.  The characters are enthralling, as is the perspective of the heroine, whose mystery is so thorough as to include even her name.<br />You like good books?  Read this one.  'Nuff said.

B000002HMH|4.0|Many ex-Metallica \\"Fans\\" labeled the group \\"sell outs\\" after the release of their longest album to date. I don't know where they get the idea that they sold out. <br />Selling out is doing what the public wants, even if it goes against your artistic view. Bands like Sugar Ray, and Smash Mouth sold out. They traded away there musical roots for cash with their 3 minute pop songs (by the way, both bands [were not good] even before making it big). <br />Metallica didn't do such a thing. They changed their style a bit during the nineties, but to their liking. They didn't do it for MTV, the didn't do it for radio play, and they didn't even do it for their fans. They changed for themselves.<br />On the first 4 records Metallica was Thrash Metal at their best. During these records James and Lars called the shots (except for when Cliff was around). They told Kirk, Jason, and even Cliff (a little) how to play a certain riff, and when to play it. During these recordings they were pretty uptite about the sound. This is why Metallica sounded the way they did during the 80's.<br />When the black album came about, James and Lars were a little more easy going with the way riffs should sound, and the way the songs in general sounded. Because Kirk is so much into jazz-rock, the black album sounds a little bluesier (but still heavy).<br />When they made Load, Kirk and Jason played a lot bigger role in the way the sound of the next record would be. Kirk added the blues, and Jason added the Alternative feel (almost Alice in Chains or Soundgarden). <br />As you can now see, they didn't sell out. The first 4 or 5 records were James and Lars'. And Load and Reload are more Kirk and Jason's.<br />Some people complained about the song lengths being to short on Load. This is just a stupid complaint. Load is not only the longest album they ever put out, but it also has the longest song in the bands history (Outlaw Torn).<br />The Average Length of Songs for their records is:<br />Kill Em All: 5.11 minutes<BR>Ride the Lightning: 5.97<BR>Master of Puppets: 6.77<BR>And Justice for All: 7.24<BR>Metallica: 5.19<BR>Load: 5.64<BR>Reload: 5.84<br />As you can see, the lengths of the songs on Load and Reload aren't very short. They are longer than Kill Em All and the Black Album. They are only slightly shorter than Ride the Lightning because of the instrumental,Call of Ktulu.<br />People even complained about their hair, can't they give the guys a break. They are about the music, not their image (another sign of selling out). They thought it was time for a change in their look so they did it. Besides, I think that was a very ballsy move on their part.<br />Now lets get to the actual music. While its not as good as their original sound, these experimental records that Metallica put out are still way above average. This record showed how talented Metallica is. It showed how good they are at song writing with their deeper lyrics, and using their instruments for melody. <br />Load also showed the world how good Metallica could groove. You can even dance to this record, while it still keeps its heaviness. Never before these recordings did a record show off how good of a guitar player Kirk Hammett is. He is not only a great metal guitar player, but also a master of the blues sound. Load and Reload really make his \\"wah-wah\\" guitar sound work.<br />Load is also Metallica's most differential album to date. It has Metal, it has blues, it has a classical sound, and it even has some country in it. The only style it doesn't have is rap (thank god).<br />This disc also has some of the groups most harsh material. King Nothing is not only their meanest song ever (almost Megadeth like lyrics), it is one of their best tunes ever. <br />While not quite \\"Fade to Black\\" or \\"One\\", \\"Hero of the Day\\" is one of the best ballads that I have ever heard. That song, along with the rest of the CD has some really, really deep meaning.<br />So in conclusion: Load isn't quite \\"And Justice For All,\\" it is a very, very good record. It is their most unique CD, and shows off the bands' talent very well. This disc has 13 excellent songs, about half a dozen gems, and one dud (\\"Mama Said\\"). I would give this 5 stars, but this isn't quite in the same ballpark as \\"Master of Puppets\\" or \\"And Justice for All.\\"
0684800713|5.0|There isn't a single false note or short-changed character in this book. A crisp and sharp-edged look at a few ex-patriates traveling around Paris and Spain, drinking endlessly, while they ask questions about how they are going to fit into the new post-war world around them.<br />Frustration, anger, contempt was never better expressed than through these &quot;lost souls&quot; of the previous century.<br />Hemingway was a master of the short sentences: his dialogue was funny without being &quot;too clever&quot; and cynical without being unnecessarily sarcastic.<br />It's disappointing to learn others had problems with this book, I can't think of a single complaint...other than it was too short.

B00005AFVR|2.0|Bruce can't do much right when it comes to live albums.  Once again he includes the same songs, virtually identical versions, of songs we've heard too many times.  Some of the more obscure material here is excellent, but to include a over 10 minute version of tenth ave. freezeout, with the ridiculous introductions of the band, was too much.  Then to include the worst song he's ever continued playing live, Murder Inc., is incredible.  I say his having seen him many times, and owning many boots that put this to shame.  What a waste.
0767849493|5.0|This is the funniest movie I've ever seen!  God is a woman, the 13th apostle was a black man, not to mention Jesus is black too. A muse who looses her touch, two prophets, one who goes by Silent Bob, and another that has the most foul mouth a man could have. It's so funny, I'd recommend it to anyone, you can't help but laugh. Check it out,
B000002J2D|4.0|What happens when you take two virtuosos out of a band? In general, that band has no air left to go. But if the name of that band is Genesis, then the answer is: there are three virtuosos left.<br /> Once Peter Gabriel left the band in 1975, people feared that the singing part could not be substituted by anyone. Phil Collings proved everyone wrong.<br /> Next in line to leave the band would be guitarrist Steve Hackett, in 1976. This time, the guitar would suffer, as Mike Rutherford, though good is never as good as Hackett. But album-wise, the album that the remaining trio recorded is one of incredible beauty where the solo capacities of the members become very obvious.<br /> Probably not the best 'new era' Genesis album (my vote for that one goes to 1980's 'Duke') but a very good album though.

B00004WIBW|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Jhonny Dep at one of his best acting. He's the best Ichbod there could be! Its a in depth look at the Legend of Sleepy Hallow. You learn about the headless horse man, and it's very gothic and creamy? It's a good moive! But for the younger one's who've seen the cartoon, this isn't for them. There is alot of graphic killing's but don't let that discourage you, but it's awesome. A must see!
6302453356|5.0|The subtitle to the play \\"Peter Pan\\" is \\"The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up\\".  Spielberg's sequel could well be called \\"The Man Who Grew Up Too Much\\".  The story of Peter Pan is reversed, as are many roles.    Robin Williams has the easy task of playing the thoughtless parent, the moderate task of playing the grownup Peter Pan, and the incredibly difficult task of making the transition between the two believable.<br />Dustin's Hoffman's Capt. Hook knows, as do all of us who remember his soliloquy, that no little children love him.  His concern with how he will be remembered, and with Good Form, ring quite true to the original.  The character is suave, urbane, vicious, captivating, and ultimately tragic. <br />At first I was annoyed at the modern elements in Never-Never-Land, but I soon realized that they had to be there, as Never-Never-Land was always a compilation of everything Lost Boys found exciting.  In the twenties, that included Red Indians, but if they were lost in the 1980s, well then, baseball and skateboards should be included.   The original play was Edwardian, but the movie makes no sense unless it's updated.<br />The role-reversal and eventual re-reversal is fascinating.  In the play, the same actor always plays both Hook and the thoughtless and cruel father, Mr. Darling.  But here, Peter is the uncaring father and a corporate pirate, while Hook takes the children to Never-Never-Land.  The lost boys are, at first, quarrelsome and threatening, while the pirates are a happy adventuresome lot, even sentimental in the lullaby sequence.  But while the Lost Boys help Peter recover himself (and to recover their own innocence), Hook's attempt to win over Peter's kids is, in the end, a failure, and we are brought full circle.  The final scene of the helpless Hook surrounded by Peter and his boys parallels the earlier scene of the helpless Peter Banning surrounded by Hook and his pirates.  (\\"Somebody lend me a hand.\\"  \\"I already have.\\")<br />The movie has one major flaw - most people don't know the Peter Pan legend well enough to really understand it.  Seeing the play \\"Peter Pan\\" won't help much, either, because there's a lot in the storybook \\"Peter and Wendy\\", and in the play's stage directions, that enhances the understanding of the movie Hook.  In a scene usually cut from the play, Peter sacrifices himself for Wendy, and thinks he is about to drown.  His line is \\"To die will be an awfully big adventure.\\"  Later, when Wendy and the Lost Boys are leaving Never-Land, Peter is left alone, slumped in his chair.  The stage directions state that at this point, if Peter only understood a little more, he would say, \\"To live would be an awfully big adventure.\\"  Hook is the story of how Peter finally learns that to live is, indeed, an awfully big adventure.  Along the way, he must also discover what a Happy Thought for a grown-up is, and that a man with no childhood is as incomplete as a boy who would not grow up.<br />The pretend-food that was always Peter's favorite kind of meal is used to excellent effect.  I found the first moment when Peter's adult façade started to break down surprisingly believable.  He is in an insult contest, and losing badly, until he finds the intersection between his grownup life and the childish contest.  He wins with the biggest, most impressive insult, ending with \\"... don't mess with me, man, I'm a lawyer.\\"<br />Maggie Smith's Wendy fills in the roles of both Wendy and Mrs. Darling from the play.  Her concern with the night-lights is especially fulfilling.  We are also re-introduced to Tootles, who was the Lost Boy who always missed the adventure, and so he does again.  Several times in the movie, the first time I saw it, I mouthed the dialogue along with the actors, because I knew that after Hook said, \\"Prepare to die\\", Peter had to reply, \\"Dark and sinister man, have at thee.\\"  There's a brief appearance of Michael's bear and John's top hat, which they took with them to Never-Never-Land so many yearsago.   Lisa and Nana return (Nana IX, really), and many other details make it a wonderful reunion. Bob Hoskins's Smee and Julia Roberts's Tinkerbell are true to the original, and yes, she says The Line She Had to Say.<br />Yes, Peter Pan grew up.  But he didn't do it when he became a lawyer; he did it in Hook.
B000008JUM|4.0|Having read some of the other reviews of this CD I felt compelled to write one of my own.  I agree that some of the renditions of Cole Porters songs are I'm sure not what he intended, but I would have to say that I don't think there is really one bad song on the album.  I am sure that as an artist he would appreciate what most of these other artists have done with his songs.  There are some songs that I like better than others, but then we all have different tastes.  This is definitely an enjoyable album, and 20 songs for under 12 bucks is not to be sneezed at.  One thing I do agree with everyone on is that is is worth buying even if you only like a couple of the artists on here, simply for the fact that the money goes to a great cause.
B000056N8X|3.0|Since Highlader 2: The Quickening (which should be renamed just the Quickening, removing Highlander from it) Highlander movies have sucked. Endgame was the becon of hope. Maybe now they'll get it right. Not quite yet. Endgame is better than H2 and H3, but its no H1. The best way to look at this movie is as a sequel to the tv show, not the movies. Only the first movie could have happened before this one, and even that is slightly impossible. I suppose that a different imaginary version of H1 happened before Endgame in which key events like being the last immortal and winning the prize didn't happen. As a sequel to the show, this movie works. As a sequel to the movies, well it pretty much is impossible. Adrian Paul was actually pretty good in his first Highlander movie. I did not like what happened to Chris Lambert's Connor MacLeod though. The best way to describe this movie is Star Trek: Generations for the Highlander series. This movie retconed the previous 3 films and paved the way for a new batch of films with Paul's Duncan MacLeod. Since Duncan didn't win the prize, we can be assured that Panzer and Davis won't make anymore mistakes like H2 or H3. H1 and Connor are casualties but maybe now we can forget the past mistakes like H2 and H3 and make new Highlander films that don't suck. I still think that the fist film should be the only one, but no matter how much we want to we can never get rid of H2 and H3.

B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is awesome! Don't stereotype or label this band as something it is not. I know a lot of people who had ideas about Tool being very heavy metal, scary marilyn manson poser types, and are glad they gave them a shot, or heard them thru someone else. Tool is a brilliant band, led by Maynard, who is not like anyone you have ever heard before. I bought this CD years back when it first came out and have had to replace my worn out copies repeatedly. It doesnt matter what kind of music you listen to. My music collection is as diverse and eclectic as anything. If you appreciate good music, you should definitely buy this record and buy buy buy buy their new record!
6302878527|1.0|The locations, the clothes, Audrey's hair - they all look fabulous. But this movie is a big SNOOZER! It's overly stylized and hard to follow - a 1960s movie experiment gone awry. It's different and modern for the sake of being different and modern, and nothing else. And, god forbid I should say this, but Audrey Hepburn is just horrible in this movie. She is so obviously ACTING - she's stiff and affected.<br />&quot;Two for the Road&quot; would have made a wonderful multi-page fashion spread in the June 1967 issue of Vogue, but as a full-length motion picture it's a big dud!
6304602898|5.0|The gremlins were first and I think they ought to do one these days where the gremlins get out and get the furbies but as for this film it is the one of the greatest movies to come from eighties.  It's a kid's film but scary enough that adults will like it but yes you should be on hand for grabbing if a child wants to watch but maybe you should watch first and see if it's suitable for your child age.  Some children are more sensitive than others are.  My daughter seems to scare easily but she loved the gremlins.  I loved it as a kid.  It's great rooting for Gizmo and hoping he ends up all right.  Hope you all enjoy it as much as my family.  I try to share the classics of my youth with my children.
B00003CXD5|5.0|John Huston created a work of art with this pessimistic, cynical and yet oddly uplifting exploration of human behavior locked in the guise of a simple adventure story. The power of materialistic greed corrupts absolutely and completely in this film, which stands proudly next to the finest stories of Steinbeck and Hemingway and the paintings of Hopper, O'Keefe and Benton.<br />Based on B.Traven's marxist tome, the film centers around three prospectors confronting greed, betrayal and death while searching for gold in the Mexican mountains. I usually despise cyncal films for they usually insult and assault the viewer. Madre instead enlightens and entertains in the best sense.<br />The worst does happen to many of these characters and almost nobody displays true altruism, hence the pessimism and yet all we can do is laugh and therein lies the uplift. Walter Huston's haunting laugh and the end does somehow life the viewers spirit above any tragedy. &quot;Laugh brother, for that is all you can do. The worst isn't so bad once it happens.&quot;<br />The rich black and white photography, performances (Bogie's fines hour among many other fine hours) writing, staging and editing all add up to a memorable film going experience. I must say I enjoy the film even more than Citizen Kane.<br />The only drawback? a perfectly awful musical score.<br />I also strongly reccomend watching this in a double feature with Peckinpah's equally excellent The Wild Bunch. The similarities are astounding. This is a definate don't miss!
6305090564|3.0|You don't need a well-developed brain capacity to get the gist of &quot;Deep Rising,&quot; but it's not without its perks. The plot is pure contrivance and formula, relying on throwing its characters into situation after situation with little regard for originality or intelligence. But there is suspense to be had with the movie, and this use of non-stop action keeps it moving at a pace that keeps it enjoyable on a level which requires little thought. There is a surprising amount of intensity, but what really sells me on this movie is the witty dialogue from the cast and the nicely-crafted special effects. <br />The movie opens with two separate stories, one involving a water transport service led by John Finnegan, who is unaware that his passengers are transporting massive firearms to their undisclosed destination. This revelation sparks a takeover of the boat by the gruff passengers, leaving Finnegan and his two crew members, Joey and Leila, at their mercy. As this is happening, the new cruise ship Argonautica is out on its maiden voyage until a mysterious person tampers with the computer mainframe of the vessel and causes the ship to lose any and all control. To complicate matters for the passengers, the ship is brought to a terrifyingly jolting halt, accompanied by spooky noises from outside the ship's hull. <br />The two stories converge at this point, as Finnegan's vessel arrives at its destination: the disabled cruise ship, at which point everyone but one of the bandits and Leila board the ship. Armed with machine guns and a vast array of weapons, they search the ship from top to bottom, only to discover that the passengers are nowhere in sight, save for the beautiful Trillian St. James, a seductively crafty thief whose attempts to rob the ship take a backseat to staying alive, and the ship's captain, Simon Canton, the pouty whiny jerk of the story. <br />At this point, things begin to get a little clearer. We learn the secret connection between Canton and thearrival of the gun-laden bandits, while also discovering that the ship has become infested with worm-like creatures with a taste for humans. They don't merely eat humans, but drink them and then rid themselves of the skeletal remain, which will turn more than a few stomachs in the audience. The story segues into a race for survival, as they struggle for a way out of the ship before they are all digested by the creatures. <br />The story itself is mostly juvenile, and despite its R rating, it is given a pretty basic treatment that most preteens would be able to understand. This is due to its never-ending formulaic plot twists and contrived attention-grabbers that pop up at least once every minute. Scenes which pit the surviving members of the group against the dangerous monsters always leave a way out for them, and it is because of this that we are able to predict so early on who will end up making it off the ship. There seems to be a mantra for the story that if you can't find a way out of a situation, then the most ludicrous scenario you can imagine turns up being the way out. The movie follows this mantra in almost every action sequence, and I found myself heaving an &quot;Oh, please&quot; through a good bit of the film. <br />Writer/director Stephen Sommers shows no apparent shame in borrowing from almost every disaster movie involving a creature or a ship that we've seen done before. There are elements of &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; present in a scene that requires our heroes to swim through underwater sections of the ship to reach a safety spot. The composition of the creatures comes dangerously close to copying the &quot;Anaconda&quot; craze, and let's not forget to mention how they travel through the ship, which is resonant of &quot;Alien,&quot; in which the alien made its way around through air-conditioning vents (here, our creatures use water pipes). <br />What comes as a surprise to me is the amount of suspense the film totes along with this formula and contrivance. All of those plots twists and attention-grabbers may be old, but they certainly have not lost their touch, and I found myself watching with increased attention and jumping in certain scenes. This movie uses a lot of fast shocks, especially ones accompanied by sudden, shrill chords of music, and these work quite well in delivering shocks and thrills. And those situations where they always find a way out? Well, they may get out, but it's not without the close calls and the heightened rush of adrenaline you get from watching scenes like this. You know they'll make it to safety, but there's always that little area in your mind which questions that fact. <br />What really makes the movie enjoyable is the way Sommers incorporates humor and witty dialogue into the story to balance out the thrills and shocks. This is becoming increasingly fervent in his films, and was the case with his remake of &quot;The Mummy.&quot; In the midst of all the intensity and violence, we are still given a chance to laugh at the characters' remarks, mostly from Trillian and Joey. Trillian is played by Famke Janssen, who has such a knack for turning colorful phrases and making them completely convincing (if you don't believe me, watch 1999's &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;). And Kevin J. O'Conner plays Joey, whose subtle timidity and high-pitched voice make him a stand-out for comedy. <br />Treat Williams plays a good action hero as John Finnegan, and while his character may seem a little too hammy (and maybe a little too insightful as to the connection between the captain and the villians), he plays it well and looks like he's having fun with it. Anthony Heald is our whiny, two-faced antihero as captain Canton, and his segue is well-acted and convincing. The supporting cast also includes Wes Studi, Derrick O'Connor, Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, Clifton Powell, Trevor Goddard, Djimon Hounsou, Una Damon, and Clint Curtis.<br />Despite its many flaws, &quot;Deep Rising&quot; can be a fun and exciting ride that is not without its suspense factor. It does prove, on a mediocre level, that formula and contrivance can sometimes be fun. Wit and humor abide very nicely within this film, which allows us to laugh while jumping in fright at just the right moments.
B000000H4V|4.0|I can't compare this to any other Sep CDs, as this is the only one I currently own.But I would count it among my favorite albums.The guitars are heavy, and the bass is often distinct and seperate.And Igor's drumming!!It's just awesome!Despite the prevelent heaviness, it's melodic and listenable, as opposed to death metal.Standouts include &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot;,&quot;Territory&quot;, and &quot;Nomad&quot;. But all of he songs rock, and I would definitely recommend it to fans of old school thrash, and Pantera/Slipknot thrash.
B000059TPN|5.0|The Rock is quite possibly one of the very best action movies ever.  It's amazing cast, great action sequences and incredable dialogue and one-liners brighten up the screen.  I unfortunatly own the normal edition because the Criterion Collection wasn't out yet.  Believe me if it was I would have bought it.  I have to assume the Criterion collection is unbelievably amazing.  A whole second DVD of extra stuff.  I also own Gladiator on DVD and I really appreciate the second disk.<br />I will quickly discribe the story to you.  A US general gone mad[gen. Hummel (ED HARRIS)] takes over Alcatraz(or the rock)threatening to launch a battery of very dangerous gas rockets into the heart of San Francisco. The US government decides to send in a SWAT team of Navy Seals.  Along with the Navy Seals the government sends chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed(Nicholas Cage) and the only person to successfully escape Alcatraz, John Mason(Sean Connery).  The SWAT team enters the rock and all members are brutally killed in a major battle, except Goodspeed and Mason.  It is now up to them to defeat a platoon-full of elite marines before the entire San Francisco population is inhialated.<br />The Rock is a truly superb movie and will be enjoyed by all.  It has a great story,cast &amp; crew, dialogue and action scenes.  Stanley Goodspeed's fiance is really hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004Z459|3.0|I think Linkin Park is both under-rated and over-rated.This Cd is not awful, but it's not five star material.The guitars are somewhat repetative,the bass is lacking, and the Dj is really not needed.The occasional good Dj is fine with me, but this particular one isn't par for the course.And why two singers?The great Chino Moreno has more range than both of hese guys.But anyway, this cd is pretty good. A pro of this album is the fact that there is no cursing.Cursing doesn't offend me,but many bands take to the extreme,which is VERY boring.These guys may be a great band one day,but now they're just average.
0553573411|4.0|In Assassin's Apprentice Robin Hobb created a child-adolescent character more convincing than most author's can do, particularly in the sff genre. ...  are probably the only sff child characters I have read about recently which struck the same chord of realism, and even then her children were all prodigies, wise beyond their years. Fitz graduates to the ranks of adolescent-adult in this novel and though he is anything but wise most of the time he is superlatively human - his behaviour despicable at times and his motives suspect, still he remains in my mind one of the great sff characters of the 90s.  I have a dislike for black and white/good vs evil literature and Robin Hobb's two recent series have well suited my tastes, where sympathy might be felt for an assassin or a pirate and distaste for a king of good character (e.g. Shrewd) or a beautiful dragon.  Whilst reinventing traditional fantasy themes such as dragons (given their mystical nature i think dragons can be a theme as much as a character), Hobb also managed to include seemingly uber modern themes which I think give her an edge over most writers in this genre. The principal theme I'm thinking of here would have to be abuse, for I think that it was Hobb's treatment of the abuse that Fitz suffered that gave him life as a character. Whilst Assassin's Apprentice showed the mental and physical abuse that crippled Fitz's skill (and his character in many ways), and the excellent sequel to this series shows his abuse by fate, Royal Assassin is an often troubling account of Fitz's abuse of himself. drug/skill abuse &amp; mental self-abasement addle Fitz's growth into adulthood and for anyone who has seen similarly young, bright minds descend into despair and irresponsibility it was just as amazing a piece of writing as more famous/mainstream tracts on drug abuse.  Because Robin Hobb's novels are exceptionally great adventure stories and meet conventional expectations for fantasy trilogies, I think that her talent for writing complex human emotion is sometimes ... ....just hoping to remind everyone to think carefully about what they are reading and give this writer credit where due. It's writers like this who are raising the profile of sff.
B000003BEM|4.0|There have been several versions of the Rolling Stones--The British Invasion Stones, The Fight The Power Stones, The Jet Set Stones, The Heroin Stones, The Disco Stones, The Aging Punk Stones, The Blues Stones, and the current version: The Tour On Bad Albums and No Hits Stones.<br />Beggars Banquet is the Fight The Power Stones in full bloom.<br />I am mystified by Jimmy Miller's production.  On acoustic numbers like &quot;No Expectations,&quot; &quot;Dear Doctor,&quot; &quot;Factory Girl&quot; and &quot;Prodigal Son,&quot; he steps away and lets the performances speak for themselves.  As a result they are great, great recordings.<br />But his approach to the electric numbers, especially &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; and &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; is just baffling. &quot;Stray Cat Blues,&quot; which exists in masterpiece form on GET YER YA-YA'S OUT, is all muddied up here, with Jaggers vocal buried down in the mix, and &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; is virtually unlistenable.<br />And what to say of &quot;Salt Of The Earth&quot;?  The debate has always been about sincerity.  Was Jagger, already a millionaire and only about 20 months removed from tax exile status, nodding to charity or poking a stick at it?  Either way it's a great tune and, I think, Keiths first real vocal.<br />I should say I'm not a typical Stones fan, by the way.  For instance, I've never been much of a fan of &quot;Sympathy For The Devil,&quot; which I find kind of silly.  Great backing vocal part, though.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I own. I have listened to all of the tracks over and over for almost a year now. The first time that I heard the song, &quot;With Arms Wide Open,&quot; I cried. I'm a male and that is the first and only song that I have ever cried after hearing it. If I were you, I would buy this album right away to listen to all of the different kinds of music. And the highly spiritual lyrics.
B000002GYR|5.0|This great, great album, arguably the best of Waits career, has been in my Top 10 since the day I first heard it.  If anything, it has edged higher up my personal chart as the years have gone by.<br />Once upon a time it was a great late night drinking album, one my friends and I would listen to on cassette while driving from DC to Baltimore and back on a Saturday night.  Later, during a phase I'll only mysteriously hint at, because that will give me a cool, artistic aura that drives chicks crazy, it was a late night drinking LP for me and me alone.  Still later, it was a great CD to sing along to as I tried to get my newborn son to sleep.  He still likes these songs.<br />There is so much great music here that I won't even waste your time with a track-by-track review.  My personal favorites are &quot;Old Shoes(&amp; Picture Postcards&quot; and &quot;Grapefruit Moon,&quot; but this is a near-perfect record, from open to close.  Anyone who saw Bette Midler's teary version of &quot;Martha&quot; on Saturday Night Live a few generations ago could see the effect Waits songwriting had on his L.A. contemporaries.<br />By the way, Waits version of &quot;Ol' 55&quot; proves that the Eagles, who covered it on their first LP, could kill even the greatest of tunes.
630588255X|5.0|This movie is a must-see... period.  I have never been so moved by a film before in my life.  Harold and Maude is such a creative film filled to the brim with symbolism and dark humor that every time I watch it, I find something else to sincerely reflect on. I don't really know anyone who didn't like this movie upon first viewing.<br />I will not describe this movie for the sheer fact that it makes an incredible impact on the viewer if he or she knows absolutely nothing about it.  I know, because it did me.  I highly recommend you do NOT read any description, spoiler review or anything related to the content of this movie because the pleasure with viewing this will be much, much more intense.  Go rent or buy and laugh and cry -- I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

Warner have transferred &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; to DVD in it's original aspect ratio-2.35:1,and the picture is stunning,to say the least.Pin sharp throughout,never has &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; looked so good,and the sound quality also,does justice;The Fairground ride noises,the motorbikes,even the Vampires flying through the air,crystal clear.The only thing really missing from this DVD is some cool extras;maybe Warner Bros.and Joel Schumacher will surprise us,soon.Overall,Excellent entertainment,picture and sound quality to match,and reasonably priced,4/5.
B00004X01U|2.0|I've been a Madonna fan since 1983 and I'll tell you this--I'm a fan, but I'm not a &quot;yes-Madonna&quot; fan.  That is, I don't rate EVERYTHING that she makes 5 stars, which I find incredibly irritating when it comes to buying music.  All musicians make great, good and okay albums and okay is what &quot;Music&quot; is all about.<br />First of all, if you're looking for another &quot;Ray of Light&quot; look again.  Whereas &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was a great album, &quot;Music&quot; doesn't necessarily hold up.  Toted as French-techo, this album is unique, but mostly acquired taste in my opinion.  It truly sounds as if she was influenced by Cher's &quot;Believe&quot; album with the synthesizer-enhanced vocals and pops and squeals.  It's not bad, it's just not that great.<br />The strongest song is pretty much &quot;Music&quot; which quite frankly has been played to death on the radio.  The rest of the album I find that I hit skip, skip, skip looking for something good to leave on and suddenly the album is over.  That isn't necessarily a good sign of a great album.  &quot;What it feels like for a Girl&quot; isn't bad, actually is pretty good, although I prefer the suped-up techno version played with the banned video (which is being released on DVD -- more on that later.)  The other one song I like is &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; which is because I like the dance-techno style and quite frankly get bored with Madonna's ballads because she really hasn't had one with much depth since &quot;Take a Bow.&quot;  Other than that, &quot;Don't tell me&quot; is okay, but the only other song worth listening to. The rest is pretty much forgettable.<br />The worst about this album would be the number of songs and the jacket content.  She REALLY skimped on the number of songs as well as there's almost nothing on the jacket aside from diva-like posed pictures.  There isn't any lyrics or even real personal messages -- just facts and of course, &quot;Go to this website!&quot; which bugs me.  Madonna used to be about artistic expression, but I'm beginning to believe that she is now about money.  Comparing to the quality of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; which even had patchouli oil mixed with the glue to give the disc jacket a &quot;church-smell&quot; to it, this is a huge disappointment.  &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was a work of art--music and content-wise.  &quot;Music&quot; is not.  Basically, &quot;keeping it simple&quot; means getting more money out of you for a cheaper disc.  Very disappointing as well as feeling taken advantage of.<br />So what do I recommend?  Listen to it first before buying it.  In fact, go download the MP3s somewhere (and don't feel that you're &quot;cheating&quot; her out of a profit because her whole album was on Napster for two months and ended up becoming the biggest selling debut of an album she's ever had...interesting, isn't it?)  If you like what you hear, go ahead and buy it.  If you like the techno version of &quot;What it feels like for a Girl,&quot; go buy the DVD, which has the audio track on it rather than the album.h bugs me.

0767817664|4.0|Poor old Mr.Vincent,could never really come to terms with his treasured little mirror bearing no reflection,to Jerry Dandridge.Peter Vincent's idea of Fright Night,was a cheap,tacky horror show,that had bad ratings,not this. And Charley Brewster,watching too much T.V,started to actually believe that their new neighbor slept in a coffin.And why did Charley's Mother have to go and let Jerry in the house,now he can come around whenever he wants.And why is Jerry always out everyday,and only appears after six p.m,eating an apple? Fright Night maintains an interest throughout,shining through in terms of Direction and Script,and the performance of Roddy McDowall as the local T.V.Stations &quot;Peter Vincent&quot;-Vampire Killer,who will not believe young Charley Brewster,who begs for Peter's help,to seek out and kill the Vampire next door!Excellent,inevitable,and well staged climax-the look on Peter Vincents face at the end,beaming!-show's every possible,relevant emotion,perfectly.About the transfer:Outstanding,shown at 2.35:1,allowing the full width,and fine details coupled with just the right colour depth,&quot;Fright Night&quot;,to date,Never looked this good.The sound:English/2-Channel Dolby Surround,gives an adequate performance.No real emphasis on not being subtle,but clear,with no background noise,source,or hissing related problems.Overall,in terms of picture quality alone,this DVD emerges a winner.A special Edition of this film,with a 5.1 soundtrack would be cool.4/5 for this Edition.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I know alot of people will that have listened to &quot;Jagged&quot; and &quot;junkie&quot; might disagree with me saying this album is worst then the first. But I certainly beg to differ!!! It has so much growth lyrically,vocally,emotionally,and musically. And whether you're happy with the newer Alanis music Alanis is sure as heck happy with it. And so am I. Tracks like thankyou represent all the things that helped her find peace in her three year break,and more. Unsent is just talking sincerily to other people. And all the other tracks have a wonderful and significant meaning. Allthough its not filled with the same angst as was &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; its still a great buy for a someone looking for an alternative to the lighthead pop found everywhere in the music industry nowadays. She has shown unlike most artist she can grow in all directions and expand and not let others get in her way. And I respect that more then anyone will ever know. I hadn't read any of the other reviews because it would alter my opinion. So here it is and here's the truth on a truly inspiring record. By a truly inspiring artist.
B00004XONN|5.0|Its all about tracks 4 and 10... anyone who would even think of reviewing this poorly is a schmuck.... this CD is amazing, you just have to be in the right mood for it...
0440219078|5.0|I'm gonna keep this short and sweet..... The Giver by Lois Lowry is the best book I have ever read. Its one of those books that make you think, and the ending leaves you feeling fulfilled. Wonderful descriptions also. I recommend everyone, young and old read this book.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This was one film that I really enjoyed from start to finish. The DVD looks and sounds Fantastic if you have a Dolby Digital or DTS system. I have watched this movie at least ten times already. I really like the story of revenge against the Emperor. The coliseum looks great! Russel Crowe does such a superb job that I was quite happy when he won the Oscar for Best Actor. I really thought Ridley Scott would finally win an Oscar for Best Director, but again he gets the shaft. My friends come over all the time and this is the only movie they want to watch over and over. Of course this is more of a guy movie. My wife and her friends like it, but didn't love it. The second DVD has some really great deleted scenes that I thought should have been included. It is definitely worth buying.
B000002UDB|5.0|This record has gotten alotta bad rap but it is a beatiful and fun album.... worth every penny. &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is one the most beautiful songs to come from the psychedelic era.
0679879269|4.0|The His Dark Materials trilogy is an incredible, imaginative trio of books. All well thought out, cleverly crafted, a designed to take you to other worlds. I was left craving more of Lyra and Will's world(s) after the second book, and I got it. This trilogy is number 2 on my entire book list (sorry- no one can beat Harry Potter). I loved a devoured this book, myself wishing I could climb through a window in the air into the town of Citagazze (is that how you spelled it?) or into so many of the intriging worlds. You may be wondering why, then, I chose to rate this book with 4 stars. Although I only have 1 complaint, it is a big one. Me, being a very religious christian did not enjoy the anti-god (sorry if that is too harsh)  portion. I will not complain however, because everyone, Including Pullman is intitled to there opinions. I just warn you that if you are teetering on the edge of the religion decision, don't take this book to seriously. There is a God! Just remember this is fiction. The part about no god is just as true as the part about talking animals. Once again, I do urge you to read this book if you can understand it is a work of fiction, because it might well be the best work of fiction on the planet. (Not counting Harry Potter- of course.)
B00005ASOC|4.0|Finding Forester if taken as an independant fil is excellent with Sean Connery making a comeback in one of his greatest roles yet.  Finding Forester is about a young male who is in with a bad crowd and who has never been academic who stumbles across an old man in an apartment.  The old man turns out to be William Forester who wrote an awrad winning novel who then dissapeared.  The young man (Jamal) is played by a newcomer (Rob Brown), who gives his character that something special as we dont have any preconceptions of him.  Finding Forester is a film worth watching, and yes it is similar to Good Will Hunting but wasnt that a good film as well
B00003CX8J|4.0|I really didn't know much about the X-men. I have a friend who absolutely loves them. He would describe all the characters and would tell me over and over that I have to read some X-men comic books. Anyhow, I went with my wife to see this movie. I really like Wolverine - a very funny, sarcastic wit that steals the movie. Everyone else is O.K. The bad guys in the movie are more appealing then the good guys, but there should have been more bad guys. The picture and the sound on the DVD are excellent! Last year there weren't that many fun movies to go and see, but this sure was one of them. Even my wife, who doesn't like comic book movies, liked this picture more than I did.
B000001E8S|4.0|As a longtime fan of both U2 and Brian Eno, my expectations were high for this collaboration. I made the mistake at first of trying to listen to this in the morning, on the way to work. The choppy first track, &quot;United Colours,&quot; turned me off, and by the time the beauty of &quot;Slug&quot; (pretty song, ugly title) was kicking in, I'd switched to another CD. The next time I gave the CD a listen, I was in bed, listening to headphones and gazing at the small slit of light beneath the bedroom door. That atmosphere meshed with the textures and mood of this album, and as &quot;Slug&quot; gave way to &quot;Your Blue Room,&quot; I felt like a powerful medication was kicking in. The rest of the first side -- &quot;Beach Sequence&quot; in particular -- builds up to &quot;Miss Sarajevo,&quot; one of the best tracks U2 or Eno has ever done. The blips and stomping drums of the next two tracks introduce the more experimental and ambient -- and less listenable -- side of the album. &quot;Corpse&quot; is relaxing, but the comedy track &quot;Elvis Ate America&quot; is painful to listen to. The last three tracks don't rescue it, and the album's second side is a disappointing anticlimax following the sweeping buildup of side one. This is a great CD. However, if it were trimmed to a seven- or eight-song EP, I'd be inclined to give it five stars.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I found Secret Garden purely by accident, but now I am so in love with this cd.  The music is so beautiful, romantic, and peaceful.  I used the song &quot;Seranade to Spring&quot; as my processional music for my wedding, and had so many people asking about it.  Even if you don't usually listen to new age/celtic music, buy this cd!
014100018X|5.0|I originally saw the movie first and instantly fell in love with the story and I ran out to get the book (I know we're supposed to do it the other way round so shot me).  After the first few pages I noticed some major differences between the book and the movie so I was unsure if I'd like it but I have to say it has been great to read it and to see the differences.  The book is just so vivid in it's descriptions and it's feeling is just wonderful, no wonder it was made into a movie.  Buy this book and enjoy it with a cup of hot chocolate.
0440539811|1.0|When I was a child, I spake as a child.  I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.       -1 Corinthians 13.11.<br />Like virtually everyone else, I read this book in high school after I had finished Umberto Eco's _The Name of the Rose_ and _Foucault's Pendulum_, which I greatly enjoyed.  I forced myself to finish it simply to prove that I could.  Here's the way it is folks:  Robert Anton Wilson (RAW - as he refers to himself) is an infant, and he wants to be treated like a screaming brat infant.  Give him a slap!  His admirers, all suffering from attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder (AD/HD) after reading this book are infantile too.  The &quot;philosophy&quot; (certainly not meriting that dignified epithet) behind this book is nothing more than a series of self-competitive hedonistic nonsense progressively aiming to outdo each previous iteration of its own ridiculousness in hopes of achieving something revolutionary - a series of baubles used to amuse three year old babies.  However, there is no synthesis, nothing is produced from it.  Rather, it would have us all robots driven outside of our minds by every blind and base impulse imaginable in a hedonic frenzy, all the while engaging in remorseless rape of the language to achieve some sort of verbal ecstasy.  To overcome the ennuie which immediately ensues we are provided with grandiose puzzles (paradoxes) to contemplate with ever increasing absurdity.  This sort of mental hedonism can lead to only one thing, total and complete destruction.  It is not the highest in man; rather, it is in fact his lowest.  Instead of seeing this as a product of euphoriant intoxication or mental disorder (let's not give it that much credit folks, even drugs or mental disease would produce more profound effects), I prefer to look at it as the product of a reasonably intelligent mind that has chosen to systematically disengage its will.  This philosophy comes complete with ameans of self-identification among its anarchist followers, through the presence of the word &quot;fnord&quot; appearing at various places in their reviews.  As you can tell by reading some of the reviews here many of Wilson's disciples seem to have mastered the art of sesquipedalian obfuscation - an iterative procedure to generate pseudo-profundities by the successive manufacture of nonstandard grammatical combinations through the use of excessively big words.<br />P.S.  By the way, if you're going to send me an email calling me a fascist, an &quot;authoritarian personality&quot;, a control freak, or whatever other psycho-anarchist buzzword is popular among latte' drinkers don't even bother.  I don't respond to that.  It seems every time I tell it like it is about Wilson, one of his hypnotized &quot;disciples&quot; sends me hate mail.<br />[If you agree with me on this point, but would still like some alternative type literature to puzzle over, I recommend both Douglas Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_ and Mark Danielewsky's _House of Leaves_.  For the real Illuminati, read the book _Fire in the Minds of Men_, which discusses the role of freemasonry in the French and Bolshevik revolutions.  For conspiracy read Pauwels' and Bergier's _The Morning of the Magicians_.  Hell, even Pat Robertson's _New World Order_ and _The Unseen Hand_ by Epperson carry more weight than this.]
014028009X|5.0|I kept on resisting reading this book but when I knew the movie was coming I gave in if only to be able to say I'd read it before seeing the movie.  I was pleasently surprised.  This book is realistic and it addresses a lot of the neurosis that we all suffer from each and every day.  Bridget has one hell of a year in this book, but it and read it and see how much of you is in this book.
0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevalier eloquently conveys the richness and rustics of everyday life back in the mid-1600's to a piece of paper. This book sent shivers down my spine. Griet, is an amazing character, full of spunk and confidence, and is the subject of one of Vermeer's most celebrated paintings. This book truley is a gem, and whatever your age, its an amazing novel.
B000001F7R|4.0|On Through The Night..the debut album by Def Leppard had a sound that was a combination of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. The producers were definitely looking at the boys from Sheffield as the replacement to England's most famous rock group, and it was reflected in Joe Elliott's singing on this CD. On Through The Night is more hard driving than the 'mainstream' Def Leppard that most fans are used to. And personally I think their best track is on this CD..a track called Wasted. It has in my opinion one of the best opening guitar riffs in rock music, but yet this CD is highly overlooked because it was so early.   This CD is a great effort by what was at the time a band full of teenagers. If you are any sort of Def Leppard fan, you need this CD to get an idea of what the beginning was for these guys. From this CD onward, you can tell that they were going to be something big.
B00003CXPD|3.0|Think Rocky in tights.<br />The performances are solid, Jamie Bell a find, the father great. We've seen the story a million times before. The 'powerful' scene where he dances in anger I found irritating. Cliched on the teacher, Granny, Brother characters.<br />Great soundtrack though.<br />Want to see a great movie with the same themes get 'Kes'.
B000002B7W|5.0|For anyone who doesn't understand how much Randy Rhodes meant to Ozzy Osbourn, get this CD. Randy was probably the most elite guitarist of his time. There are two tracks on this CD that show how far ahead of the pack he was. His solos on Mr. Crowley and Suicide Solution are just mindblowing. Unfortunately Randy was taken from us all far too early in a fatal plane crash. Ozzy's response was to have this CD put together to remember the best of Randy's work and ability. Another track on here that shows the direction that Randy was going is the track Dee. It's just a simple bit of fiddling about on guitar in the studio, but you could see how he was a classically trained musician, who found a way to make this sound work in the hard rock/metal genre. This CD really does do justice to the work of Randy Rhodes, and all Ozzy fans or even guitar fans should have this CD as part of their collection due to the brilliance that was Randy Rhodes.
B00005B6C9|5.0|Well for those fans of the Bee Gees who felt left out in the cold when they  dropped they're classic  `60s &amp; `70s rock sound and went disco around `75,  welcome back! It's been a long time coming, but they're new album This Is  Where I Came In (Universal) is absolutey brilliant! This is no disco or heavy  dance record. This album is not filled with over produced sappy r&amp;b styled  songs. This album is CLASSIC BEE GEES and ranks right up there with some of  they're greatest works as a well-rounded and crafted work. Past Bee Gees  albums that rank up there in my books are Odessa (1969), 2 Years On (1970),  Mr. Natural (1974) and Main Course (1975). Yes, they produced some great  songs on Children Of The World, Spirits Having Flown, Living Eyes, ESP, One,  High Civilization, Size Isn't Everything and Still Waters. But as a genuine  album that collects one great tune after the other, well they don't come  close. This Is Where I Came In does! The title song &quot;This Is Where I Come In&quot;  is just the tip of the iceberg with its &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941&quot; feel.  Maurice who usually gets to sing lead on 1 tune every couple of albums has  two here. &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air&quot; are brilliant and can  easily be top choices for hit singles. The latter has one of the most  beautiful choruses from the guys in a long time. This song is a smash! A  light Euro dance/rock groove graces both. Barry Gibb turns in some great  tunes and some great vocals in his real voice once again. No falsettos here!  &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; &amp; &quot;Wedding Day&quot; are beautiful ballads with a country/r&amp;b  tinge. On &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot; they rock harder than they ever have with  Barry spitting out line after line without running out of gas. Perhaps they  have been listening to too many Motorhead, Sex Pistols, David Bowie and Iggy  Pop records lately! The chorus echoes David Bowie's twisted punky style  vocals. Love it! As for Robin &quot;Deja Vu&quot; &amp; &quot;Embrace&quot; show that he also can  deliver the goods. Both songs have shimmering acoustic guitars with catchy  melodies and choruses that his voice glides over like an angel in flight. The  latter once again incorporates a light Euro dance groove.  &quot;She Keeps On  Coming&quot; has him and the guys rocking `n' rolling. Yes they have put they're  rock `n' roll boots back on. I think I said enough already. The other songs  are equally as good and now you will have to be the judge. If you have a  musician's ear which I have (I'm a musician), you can tell these songs were  produced very sparse and that both the music and vocals were recorded live  with very few over dubs. Just like they're great `60s &amp; `70s rock classics.
B000009EAD|3.0|First off, there are two reasons why I bought this CD: 1. The artwork on the cover is incredible. It reminds me of Todd McFarlane's artwork and I've always been a big fan of his. 2. I've read multiple reviews for this band and they always get compared to Iron Maiden. now. Iron Maiden are my number 1 favorite metal band of all time, hands down. So I decided to give some new metal a try because listening to powerslave and number of the beast OVER AND OVER AND OVER gets a little tiresome. haha.. well, not really but anyway.. onto the friggin' CD. When listening to it, the first thing I noticed about it was the guitar work. It's VERY well done and the song structures are deeply rooted in classic metal. The vocals and lyrcis get a little annoying at points but it's not too bad because the musicianship really overshadows that. The sound and producing is top notch and it really has a full, rich sound to it. Now when I listen to this all I can think is that it's like James Hettfield singing for Iron Maiden. Either that or a modern day version of DIO. DIO had those same &quot;cheesy-but-still-good&quot; sensibilities so there.
B000005JAK|4.0|Husker Du has made a history of being one of the seminal punk bands of the 80's.  Listening to their albums, you notice their range of being able to play almost any kind of music.  With Candy Apple Grey,Bob Mould(guitar/vocals), Grant Hart (drummer/vocals)and Greg Norton(bassist)show their ability to sing about one of the hardest things in life, breaking up. Mould and Hart write songs that get right to the truthfulness of breaking up. Hart's &quot;Don't Want to Know if You're Lonely&quot; is a rocking plead to an ex-lover to stop tempting the narrator to come back for another heart break. Hart's songs have a full sound that give an encompassing atmosphere of what the singer is feeling. His optimistic &quot;Sorry Somehow&quot; is an organ driven punk anthem about a couple trying to give it another try. Bob Mould's songs are straight and direct, hitting you right in the chest and not letting go. The beautiful (and my personal favorite)&quot;Hardly Getting Over it&quot; shows a man trying to tell the story of a friend being ripped up by post-relationship depression and dealing with his own depression.  You can hear Mould's heart tear when he lowly sings &quot;Now he's hardly getting over it/Hardly getting used to getting by&quot;.It's one of the most emotional songs I've ever heard.  &quot;I Don't know for sure&quot; and &quot;all this I've done for you&quot; give Mould a little more kick to his emotional punch. &quot; Dead Set on Destruction&quot; is a hard punk song that call to the day's of Husker Du's suicidal opus Zen Arcade.Mould's &quot;Crystal&quot; fails to live up to the rest of the album with muddy melodies and swampy riffs that just don't give you the real Husker feel. The same goes for Mould's &quot;Too Far Down&quot; except that &quot;Down&quot; has that dark feel that Candy Apple Grey keeps after &quot;Crystal&quot;. &quot;Eiffel Tower High&quot; and &quot;No Promise Have I Made&quot; keep the emo punk light burning with smart lyrics and melodic guitars.Over all this album doesn't live up to the thrash melodies of the amazing Zen Arcade, but it's a great album on it's own terms. Grey blends acoustic emotions and alterna-punk strumming in a way that is unbrassingly evocative, and it sets Husker Du as one of the most ambitious artists from the 80's punk scene.
B00005B6C9|3.0|The buzz on this album was that is was &quot;Organic&quot; and &quot;back to basics&quot; with real instruments...etc. I think they may have been talking about the opening track only.<br />1.)&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is a great song and starts off this album with a promise.<br />2.)&quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; stays in the groove with a great moving chorus.<br />3.)&quot;Sacred Trust&quot; is the first ballad with a very restrained Barry vocal. Never goes over the top but is still good.<br />4.)&quot;Wedding Day&quot; Very nice. <br />5.)&quot;Man In The Middle&quot; Ouch. Reminds me of Maurice's &quot;Omega Man&quot; from the &quot;Size Isn't Everything&quot; album. Too much programming.<br />6.)&quot;Deja Vu&quot; Wonderful! My immediate favorite. Curiously, it's all Robin (with studio musicians) Barry and Mo are nowhere to be found except in the writing credits. Great song.<br />7.) &quot;Technicolour Dreams&quot; Surprising...and charming.<br />8.) &quot;Walking On Air&quot; Ouch, again. Sorry Mo (and Mo fans.)<br />9.) &quot;Loose Talk Costs Lives&quot; another smooth Barry ballad that once again stays steady and never really boils or goes over the top. Still nice.<br />10.) &quot;Embrace&quot; begins with an acoustic guitar and then goes techno. Disapointing.<br />11.) &quot;The Extra Mile&quot; Orchestrated ballad that reminds me of thier early days.<br />12.) &quot;Voice In the Wilderness&quot; What the hell?? Written by Barry and the backing band this is an odd rocker that stomps the album to a close. Puzzling and unexpected...but...okay.<br />All in all I'm thrown for a loop. I thought I had them figured out. Some nice magical moments, but really weighed down by the lesser songs.
B00005AUBA|2.0|The anticipation over, dissapointment fills my heart. I have been thoroughly misled. After reading several reviews of Mogwai's new Rock Action CD, excitement and curiosity filled every part of my being. Now, after purchasing the CD on its release date and listening to the product, I have lost some respect for the band who was previously one of my favorites. The CD is not reminiscent of their greatest work. Some might say they have taken a step forward. To me, they embarked on too many collaberations and came up with a CD that barely scratches the surface. Their previous CDs were filled with so much emotion. I would sit back and sink into their content. ROCK ACTION doesn't even give me enough time to sit. Clocking in at just over 38 minutes, and containing only 6 real songs, the CD left me wanting a refund. If they had used some of their previous formulas as a point of reference, I am sure I would have given the CD more stars. Instead I am left scratching my head wondering why they ever hooked up with Dave Fridmann.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! It is a sweet wonderful story about a boy following his heart to do what he really loves and a father and a brother who don't think that it is 'macho' or 'manly'. You find yourself cheering outloud as you watch. This is not to be missed.
B000002INR|5.0|Skid Row's debut can only be described as all telling and all knowing of the 80's youth. As an avid follower of Skid Row, I can only describe this release during a time of overplaying of other power-ballad, hair band, excess lifestyles as the ultimate in rebellion and anthems for the generation.  18 and Life was the breakthrough hit, though radio airplay had little to do with this band's rise as thousands of fans took arms with their other tunes as well. LONG LIVE Skid Row!
B000050FEN|5.0|I owned a copy of this when it first came out on dvd. Quickly gave that one away in favor of this version and I AM SO GLAD I DID!! As dark and gritty as ever, Kevin Spacey makes your skin crawl like no one else can. He is the embodiement of evil. Gwenyth Paltrow has such a small role in the film, you really wonder if she should have gotten such a high billing.Normally don't care for Brad Pitt that much, because I find him to be too much of a pretty boy, but he is good as the somewhat cocky new guy learning the ropes from Morgan Freeman's character who wants to retire, but can't until the John Doe murders are solved. This is one dvd that anyone with a dvd player should own. The movie is great and it is loaded with great extras.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is a killer DVD. There were a couple of specific items that I did not like. For example, I am into all of that sound system stuff- this DVD is in 2.0 instead of the 5.1 Dolby Digital on normal DVDs (it is just like puting the DVD into your stereo- no independent channel for your sub). Secondly, If you have purchased the SFAM album, you know that there is a storyline. They put the clips of the storyline on the entire tv screen instead of showing JP shredding. The clips were about 5-10 sec in length- they got to be annoying after awhile. (The clips were on the monitors at the concerts). On to the good stuff... The New York show had no opening acts and lots of extras including Teresa Thomason and the Choir, and the Hypnotheripist. DT's playing is phenominal. They play the SFAM record all the way though. In the Bonus material (sorry VHS owners), DT plays Change of seasons all the way through- I have never seen them do this ever (live)! (Only on the Change of Seasons EP) I wish I could give this DVD a 6. I am very satisfied that I can play this over and over without the deterioration of the VHS tape. This is a must for any DT fan.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Funnier than Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I am not really a Brad Pitt fan, but he really proved that he can be funny here. Vinnie Jones is even better here than in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels because he has a bigger role.The  rest of the cast as always are terrific in this film about the people involed in a diamond heist gone horribly wrong, and all the people looking for it. Bencio del Torro is underused in this film, his role is small before he meets his demise, but he stands out once again. Dennis Farina is great as Avi, a Jewish jewler/gangster type  who wants the diamond back It is too hard to describe EVERYTHING about hthis film, because there is so much that happens. It is funny and violent and an all around good time, but it is far from your average gangster flick.
B000000WA4|5.0|What i find to be most impressive about this album is the range of emotions that it expresses; it goes from anger-rage-scorn (&quot;an ode to no one&quot;/ &quot;X.Y.U&quot;) to nostalgia (&quot;1979&quot;) to intimate love songs (&quot;tonight, tonight&quot;/ &quot;beautiful&quot;), among others. The point remains that on this album, the Pumpkins attempt to, and I find are successful in, expressing almost every emotion that a human being can feel. <br />Of course, with such a range of emotion, and as contrasting and conflicting emotions demand like sounds, there is also a wide range compositional styles. As one would expect, songs of anger and frustration, such as &quot;An Ode to No One,&quot; are loud and full of heavy guitars. On the other hand, songs such as &quot;Stumbleine&quot; are much quieter, although softer doesn't necessicarily mean &quot;happy,&quot; and instead is often used to explore loneliness, futility, and remembrances of yesterday. Of course, there are plenty of songs between the extremes, such as &quot;Muzzle&quot;. <br />Regardless, because of the great contrast in sound and emotion, each song, i find, gains its meaning and significance, to a degree, in relation to the rest. For example, if all of the songs were soft, the Pumpkins would come off as over-sentimental and mushy. On the other hand, if all of the songs were hard, the Pumpkins would come off as anger-obsessed (which seems to be the norm today in rock music). However, because there is a mix of soft and hard songs, they act on each other, to give additional meaning and emotional significance. For example, softer songs such as &quot;Lily,&quot; rather than being mushy and over-emotional, take on an almost eerie aura when listened to in comparison to songs such as &quot;X.Y.U&quot;. Overall, I highly reccomend this double album, although it does seem, as another reviewer put it, a bit &quot;bloated,&quot; meaning that it has a few too many songs.
0767824571|1.0|...i gave it one star so it would help to even up the number for all those collage kids who over-rate this movie so much...Now for the movie itself:= i'd read &amp; read tons of peope who had said this was the &quot;funniest movie ever made&quot;..(which its not BTW) i do love Monty Python..so i bought it expecting a very very good comedy (Mel Brooks,or Zucker-Brothers standards perhaps)....&amp; the first time i seen it (i was honestly wanting to love it)i was extremely disapointed overall- it was funny enough when the python cast was on screen, but when others were thrown into the picture (mostly scenes in the boring castles) it became rather cheap...&amp; speaking about &quot;cheap&quot;= one thing that hurt this movie a lot (for me) was the picture-quality.. this picture was FOGGY,FOGGY FOGGY !! (not to mention that in the actual scenes of the movie they used FOG everywhere they went as a scenic prop)...most of it is GRAINY as well..if they had made this with a different &quot;look&quot; it would of been much more enjoyable..but the color was saturated it was very bright &amp; the whole thing looked DULL when putting up with the Fogginess (the grain isn't that annoying, but my god the fog is it makes it look so saturated &amp; DULL...........as for the much critisized &quot;ending&quot;= its not bad at all, it was an original &amp; mean-spirited way to end the silly thing (&amp; it showed that it wasn't taking itself too seriously)-..i sort of liked it....this is by no means the funniest movie ever made (not even close)&gt;&gt;&gt;BUT it is funny on its own terms...&amp; some funny scenes (which should of been carried out further &amp; done better) keep it afloat &amp; afterwards it just sort of lies there like a cheap, likable movie.....i did laugh out loud at the &quot;run away-run away&quot; scenes &amp; the taunting frenchman,the Black knight,  the killer rabbit, &amp; the part where they threw the cows &amp; other animals at them off the castletop..&amp; there were some other amusing scenes (Knights who say Nee was funny but has been way over-rated)...the animations were not funny (if they were intended to be)...there were lots of dumb misfired gags that bogged it down as well. ...overall it is a very OVER-RATED comedy thats very original &amp; likable (although not always funny)..lots of things ruin it from being a great movie (which it could of been had it been done better)..i watched it a second time &amp; i felt about the same about it..but it does give some good scenes &amp; is well worth renting...(the other python movies are more amusing &amp; better done IMO)..i wanted to love it, but its just been too Over-rated by all its &quot;fans&quot;.its a fairly good movie....
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you were drawn to this soundtrack by the powerful and melodic &quot;I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; alone, then you might think again, or listen to the clips provided before making your decision.  In general however, this soundtrack has proven to be one of my all time favorites.  The excellent acoustic variety and stunning vocal performances take me back in time, as though I was sitting in a vast field, in the deep south, during the years of the Great Depression.  Moving.
6305165912|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It only gets funnier with every screening you see of it.  The dialogue is superb and the comedic content is unbelievable.  There are people who don't find this movie hilarious and do not think it is funny.  They have a poor sense of humor.  If you don't like it the first time, give it another try becuase this movie will payoff.
B00005B6C9|5.0|Odds would have you believe that within the past 25 years the Bee Gees could produce at least one disappointing album. However, like a &quot;Sacred Trust&quot;, the Bee Gees have never let this lifelong listener down!<br />&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is a wonderful compilation of individual and group efforts between the brothers. Each song has its own unique feel, yet that distinctive R&amp;B sound of the Bee Gees is present throughout. <br />Expect &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; and &quot;Wedding Day&quot; to bring tears to the eyes of &quot;brides-to-be&quot; everywhere, while &quot;Deja Vu&quot; and &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot; will take you to extreme ends of the dance floor!<br />They say that there are only TWO certainties in life: Death and Taxes.  I would propose that there are in fact THREE certainties in life: Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb<br />GREAT ALBUM! :-)
6305499365|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I really want to like this film, but it doesn't pass one age old measurement of quality. I would not pay $7.50 to see this at a theater. $4.50 matinee, yes. Rental; yes. Purchase. Not unless I found it for under $8.00.<br />I have a great deal of respect for Mike Judge. I loved Beavis &amp; Butthead; and got caught up in the whole Hank Hill propane and propane accessories saga. And this film is great in a cartoon reality sort of way. Milton is fantastic (Stephen Root is incredibly versatile); a great caricature of the scary guy cowering in the corner of his cubicle clutching a CLASSIC Swingline stapler.<br />But it's not really a film about people; per se (sp?). It's really a bunch of funny situations with one liners you always wanted to say. And Mr. Judge can always pick up colloquialisms that define his characters. The a-hole VP who says, &quot;Why don't you go ahead and...&quot; or talks about exchanging ideas and brainstorming and filling in and interface and networking and network solutions and a solution outside the box and pushing the envelope and...<br />You get the idea. And our protagonist is a GenX slacker who dreams of doing nothing. Not that interesting, and even when he attempts to bring down the company, he's still kinda boring. And he's dating Jennifer Aniston, who plays a character so innocuous that you feel like you're watching her subconsciously.<br />Add two pals and coworkers; a wannabe Beck &quot;loser&quot; computer geek and a &quot;foreign&quot;, overexcited computer geek, and what do you have? A really good cartoon. Even better than Dilbert.<br />So, all in all, this is a funny film; especially if you watch it for free. It'll probably be on Fox next year.
B000002N3N|5.0|THIS ALBUM LIKE OTHERS IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL, THE ALBUM STARTS WITH THE MEMORY OF TREES-A BEAUTIFUL INSTRUMENTAL &amp; VOICES, THEN GOES ONTO ANYWHERE IS, ANOTHER BRILL TRACK, PAX DEORUM IS VERY CLASSICAL IN SOUND, FROM WHERE I AM IS AN ELEGANT PIANO INSTRUMENTAL.  CHINA ROSES IS A BEAUTIFUL LOVE SONG HOPE HAS A PLACE REMINDS YOU OF PREVIOUS ENYA TRACKS LIKE EXILE &amp; EVACUEE. TEAHOUSE MOON IS A CATCHY KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTAL AND ONCE YOU HAD GOLD IS SIMILAR TO MARBLE HALLS IN SOUND AND THEN WE GET TO THE SPANISH TRACK: LA SONADORA AND TO FINISH IS THE UP BEAT TRACK:- ON  MY WAY HOME.
B00004Z1GH|5.0|I saw thirty minutes of this movie and at the end of this movie the two main characters kill the creators.  I found this movie a great film that shows how violence in video games may influenced people to use violence in real life.
1586210912|5.0|Within a few hundred pages of easy to read text, your view of money will be change forever.  How to make it, how to keep it, the &quot;secrets&quot; that the rich have used to manage wealth now available in such a way that every man, woman, and child can understand and apply, if they choose to do so.<br />Kiyosaki's works have become a world-wide movement that may very well spark the next age in our global society: The Financial Age.  Old unworkable myths about money are being exposed as companies lay off hundreds and thousands at a time, and stock markets fall.  People are seeking answers and &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; not only provides them, it trains the reader to use their mind and knowledge base as a tool to continually learn, apply, and prosper.  <br />There is absolutely no better entry point to the subject of Financial Literacy than reading this particular book.  If you really want to do better financially this book will instantly become your first and most important wealth building tool.  <br />Robert Kiyosaki teaches you how to use Financial Literacy right, and without the hype.  His methods are very do-able.  Share these concepts with anyone you really care about.  It will change their lives forever for the better, as it has changed mine using what Kiyosaki has to offer as the fundamental guideline to success.  I'm living proof: these methods can and DO work.  As a 20 Business Management Consultant, I've never found anything else that even comes close.<br />After you've read it, do yourself a favor and give it to your kids.  It's the only real education on money in our society they will ever receive.
B000002H97|5.0|&quot;Black Album&quot; is the one of the best albums of Metallica. it contains&quot;Unforgiven&quot;,Whereever I may roam&quot;,and other lots of excellent songs . If you don't have any metallica casettes or cds, u can start with this.Esp. listen to the songs &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and Whereever I may roam.
014028009X|5.0|Lots of other reviewers can give you a good idea of what this book is all about, but I did have a few thoughts that I didn't see in any other review.<br />What I Love: Bridget is a snap-shot of a single woman in the self-improvement obsessed 90's.  She is convinced that if she can just get down the pounds, become a nicotene-free tee-totaler, and find a decent man, she will at-last find happiness.  The problem is, Bridget's true demon is self-confidence.     I love that the book succeeds in giving a voice to women who are single, not through character flaw, or not being sexy enough to get a man, but through being too smart to settle for the wrong one just because it is hell to be alone at times.  Like Shazzer says,&quot;we don't need to wash anyone else's socks.&quot; <br />What I Don't Love: 16 alcohol units in 24 hrs?!  Hello!  Is our singleton heroine really just a functional alcoholic?  By glorifying Bridget, we are giving a skewed idea of many of us single women who are not compulsive smokers, drinkers, or &quot;Women Who Love Too Much.&quot;  Bridget is AN EXAMPLE of a single woman, but she is no icon for us all.
B000002U82|5.0|There is no comparison; this is the greatest rock album ever recorded.  There is a reason this album was on the top 100 for 714 weeks (over 14 years!)   I own this recording on Vinyl, Cassette, and now CD, and if they come up with something new I'll buy that first too. It's almost blasphemous to suggest that you could have a favorite song on this album becuase they are melded together so well, but if I had to choose I would say that Time is my favorite....
B000002JNJ|4.0|Pantera's debut on a major label proved successful.  The album is much different from all the other albums pantera has put out.  It resembles early Megadeth, and Metallica.  The riffs are fast and the solos are amazing.  CFH shows that music can be heavy, fast, and still remain different.  CFH also contains what is considered Pantera's best song, Cemetery Gates.  It's as close to a ballad the guys have ever gotten to.  The rest of the stuff on the album is some of the fastest music I have ever heard.  Definatley worth buying.
B000000OTU|5.0|Awesome cd includes my favorites walk on water, love in an elevator, rag doll, what it takes, janie's got a gun, and amazing.  This cd is a must have for all Aerosmith fans.
B00004STW3|1.0|This is probably the most humourless, pile of putrid garbage I have ever seen in a movie. I can't believe so many people like this. It is moronic.  It was excruciating to have to sit through it. I would rather be bored with nothing to do, in fact I would rather be in the dentist's chair that see this appauling insult to my good taste again. The people who like this are morons with no taste who are easily pleased by anything. This is a definite contender for my &quot;Worst movies ever&quot; list. Get a life!!!!
B000056K04|2.0|This album, like Before These Crowded Streets, was a major disapointment.  The songs are almost all pop, without the awesome jam-band sound that made Remember Two Things and Under the Table and Dreaming great 5-star albums.  Don't waste your money.  Dave Matthews Band is one of my favorite bands of all time, but I think this album REALLY sucks overall.
B000050IMG|4.0|I'm not really one for spofs but this one is great! There are plenty of cool gags and the movie doesn't go on too long or overplay anything which you tend to get in movie these days (Austin Powers!). I love the way they changed the spook's mask for a couple of scenes, especially the &quot;Wazap&quot; one. The film makers had a sense for what is funny and when it should be brought in. I want to see it again!
B00005214X|5.0|It's true.  Beatlesesque song-writing, harmonies, arrangements (All Things Must Pass, Beware of Darkness, on and on....) and Clapton/Dominos background vocals, rhythm blues, guitar (What Is Life? Wah Wah, The Art of Dying).  The new mixes allow all of the great voices on this album to come through (Harrison, Clapton, Pete Drake, Ringo, the soon to be Dominos Keltner, Gordon, and Whitlock, Ginger Baker, on and on).  Listening to Harrison (probably the most underrated rock guitarist of all time) and Clapton playing together is simply amazing.  Anyone who fancies themselves a Beatles fan must own this record.
079073639X|1.0|This movie started out well with promise of being an intriguing sci-fi. Unfortunately, the interest soon wore off and it became apparent that &quot;Sphere&quot; is just a repackaged version of various other alien orientated movies. It's &quot;Abyss&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;2001&quot; thrown together with a couple of different actors. We have a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean and there is something malevolant on board that starts to manipulate the crew. Yawn! It drags on and on and on with characters doing things for no particular reason. Why did Jackson enter the giant gold golf ball from outer space on a whim? Why, seeing what it had done to Jackson did Hoffmann follow him...and hang on! What was Hoffmann doing in this rubbish anyway? I mean you can see the other maronic actors taking the job but why dear old Dustin? He must have a severe gambling debt, or something! This film didn't require his talent!!! However it was adequately suited to Stone's and jackson's lack thereof! There is supposed to be some interesting &quot;past&quot; for Stone and Hoffman but it just doesn't work in the film. It is not intriguing and after the two or so hors when it reaches it's climax, you are asleep anyway. This is a very poor movie. OK, so it has &quot;effects&quot; but which movie these days doesn't. That means it deserves nothing above a 1 star. Give this one a miss!
B000001GQQ|5.0|In my opinion, this is THE Prokofiev 3rd Concerto to have. It is simply wildly breathtaking. Argerich does not use her formidable technique to show off what she has, but rather to benefit the music as a whole. The rhythmic drive is so intense that the orchestra - this is the Berlin Phil we are talking about here - have difficulty in keeping up with her. But nonetheless, they do a super job in accompanying her. She makes the piano sing, playing notes as if she was singing. The sheer energy of this pianist is amazing. In her debut recording for EMI, she was said to have taken several cups of black coffee before entering the studio to record. Perhaps she did the same thing for this recording? Anyway, the way she interacts with the orchestra is most uncanny. Great performers have the ability to listen to others, but Argerich has the ability to almost accompany the orchestra (!) when necessary. The piece sounds as a whole, not as individual movements, in my opinion, which is great: that way it fully keeps the listener's attention. She lets rip in the last movement and the result is unbelievably improvisatory, but she maintains tension and control in the movement, and indeed the whole concerto. I think tension is one of the main keys to playing this concerto well. Otherwise it sounds technical, not musical.  The Prokofiev ends spectacularly. Then comes the Ravel concerto in G. It is very jazzy, and Argerich's version has rarely been surpassed. I think that has a lot to do with her improvisatory approach to music. Someone commented that she is a true improvisor, in the tradition of Liszt, but unlike her predecessor, she never tampers with the notes itself. Here, that improvisatory approach really works, and it never for a moment sounded dull or repetetive. Abbado seems in full agreement with Argerich and it is another successful recording.  After the wonderful concerti, the Gaspard de la nuit. It is a notoriously difficult piece, but Argerich makes it sound dead easy, as usual. She is said to have learned the piece in less than five days when her one-time teacher Friedrich Gulda, told her to master the piece in five days. She says that it was easy because she didn't know it was supposed to be difficult! Well, that certainly comes across, and she gives a very pictorial account of the work that borders on the frightening.  The remastering is first-class. It has clarity and fullness compared with previous remastering, although in the Prokofiev the sound was a little opaque, due to the orchestral detail, which makes the orchestra sound a little compressed. But it is a small matter, as this is a disc that has few equals or competitors, and I doubt it will ever have serious competition with future versions. Stunning.
B000059R8Y|4.0|I really don't understand the amount of criticism that I find among the previous reviews.  I'm a long-time Clapton fan, and I really wanted to like Pilgrim, but I could not.  I've tried several times to revisit it, but every time I do, the same weaknesses come to the fore - my God, a whole album with Clapton playing to a drum machine?  After the fire of Cream and Derek &amp; the Dominoes.  Why would you want a drum machine on your music when you could play with any drummer you wanted to?<br />IMO, Reptile is nothing like Pilgrim, which is odd, because they share the same producer (Simon Climie) and virtually the same band.  However, on Reptile, ace drummer Steve Gadd plays REAL drums on every track, and the wonderful Impressions add a fine, fine element to the album.  Hard to believe that some people don't enjoy the Impressions in this mix; to me, they add a warmth, honesty and musicality that deeply enriches every cut.<br />Also, the song selection is much better on this album.  The covers are outstanding (I LOVE 'I Ain't Gonna Stand for It), except for Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight, my least favorite song on the album.<br />This is Clapton's best original work since Journeyman, and this has a richness that Jouneyman did not have.  Granted, Clapton doesn't burn with the fire he had years ago, but, then again, neither do I.  It doesn't mean his work is any less valid.  If your mildly curious or tempted, be open-minded and give this album a chance.  It will grow on you, believe me.<br />Personally, I love it.
1558908846|5.0|Yet another great Sylvester Stallone movie. This certainly isn't for those who like very serious movies--but this movie is really fun! It's a nice break from pure die-hard action, suspense movies (don't get me wrong I love action and suspense movies!). I do think Stallone is worthy to be called the greatest actor of all times! I really think the movie depicts how life is getting to be, although it's certainly not this bad yet.
B00005B1W7|4.0|QBVII was a TV mini series in 1974 starring Ben Gazzara, Lee Remick and Anthony Hopkins. It is a intriging courtroom drama where Hopkins is being charged with Nazi war crimes. <br />This is a riveting thriller that has been long overdue on DVD. The only problem I have with the film is overlength. It will keep you watching and guessing till the end.
B00004XOWM|1.0|well read the title and you get the picture. if you want some GOOD raprock go get (hed) pe, broke the best raprock album in my opinion. also check out linkin park, taproot, and slaves on dope.
B00005ASOC|4.0|If you've caught the trailer or read anything about this film, then you have probably already started guessing what the ending will be. But it's how the character's reach the story's end that is such a joy to watch unfold.  Comparisons with Good Will Hunting are hard to avoid, as again, the director has woven a tale of clever-boy, hiding his genius to fit in with his peers and a charismatic mentor bringing it out. However, as with G.W.H., it's the depth of characterisation that grips you, so that you don't really care about the predictability.  Buy this movie if you want to watch a perfectly paced and beautifully shot story where you're not really watching the clock wondering how much longer there is to go.  I'm repeating myself, but to sum up, Finding Forrester is a joy to watch.
B00005B6C9|3.0|Basically, this is a decent cd by the Brothers Gibb, but after seeing the A&amp;E special and hearing the single, I expected much more. The title track is excellent pop with great harmonies by the brothers. Other highlights include &quot;Deja Vu&quot; which features a great lead vocal that only Robin Gibb could deliver. Another terrific little ditty is Technicolor Dream which sounds like a song Eric Idle would have sung in a Monty Python movie. Or kind of like McCartney's &quot;Honey Pie&quot;. There's plenty of variety here, from edgy rock tunes... to soft ballads... and everything in between. I've deducted two stars because too many of the songs are mediocre. And the &quot;Wedding Song&quot; is just plain sappy (didn't Don Henley do a bad song just like this on his last album?)There is certainly enough good material to please the casual and the hardcore Bee Gee fan however, so I recommend the CD. Just don't expect it to live up to the music on there best albums like &quot;Two Years On&quot; or &quot;Horizontal&quot;. And, don't be scared off because of my three star rating. I think the people who critique cds on this site are always too generous. Every CD can't be a classic!
0553275569|3.0|This was the latest of the selections that my Reading Group picked out to read and I think that the overwhelming feeling was that we were left wondering what all the hype was about. Indeed, the book touched on a topic that is of interest to nearly everyone. Who doesn't like to think of shooting through space in a spacecraft? But, in reality, I think I am a generation too young to have experienced the fervor and fury the American people experienced. Tom Wolfe's narrative was entertaining in the beginning with the story of a pilot who doesn't get picked for Project Mercury, but then the middle section of the book gets quite dry and dreary. All I kept wondering was &quot;When the heck are they going to get launched into space?&quot; Finally, after 100 pages of tedium, we get to the actual individual space flights of the 7 astronauts and the ordeals their wives went through. This was entertaining and interesting reading which I enjoyed quite a bit. The chapters on Gus Grissom and Scott Carpenter I found fascintating since they hardly received the hero's welcome compared to John Glenn and Alan Shepard. Unfortunately, John Glenn received the lions share of the chapter when more could have been devoted to the foibles of those fellows whose flights were problematic. Overall, it was a book I am sure glad I read for its place in American history despite the problems I encountered.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Something compelled me to put the headphones on at the listening station and preview this recording. Well, I could not just preview it, I had to hear the entire CD.<br />Unlike some great albums that take time to get used to, St. Germain is immediately intoxicating. I happen to have a wide variety of musical tastes. I am very particular when it comes to jazz. The only jazz I actually own are elements found within my Frank Zappa and Steely Dan albums. I do love certain jazz, and this album is very easy to love.<br />There is a theme running through this CD and the theme is jazz flavors. You will not be bored by the continuity of jazz style because there is no one jazz style presented - and that is what I love about St. Germain. What is presented is contrast and colour throughout! Variety is the spice of life and it is found here. This music is what jazz is all about. The musicianship is superb as well as the production. Do give it a listen and hear for yourself.
B00005J6UP|5.0|To start out I am 23 and the Goonies has been my favorite movie for about the last 14 years or so.  I used to come home everyday from school and watch it with my next door neighbor!  People who have given it a &quot;bad&quot; rating have looked at it from &quot;serious&quot; perspective, not how the movie was meant to be looked at!  It is a classic children's (but also for adults!) movie containing action, adventure, comedy, and good'ol fashion fun.  The characters are based upon a gang of kids who at any point could have been you when you were younger.  There is the classic problem: trying to save the house, the classic solution: One Eyed Willie's Map and the classic bad guys trying to foil their plan: the Fratelli's.  Overall, this is one movie that anyone who saw as a kid can't help but love it now; even if you did not see it as a kid it is one that you must rent, buy or borrow from a friend because of its long lasting &quot;movie durability!&quot;  Can't wait for the DVD version!
0385486804|2.0|The story is an interesting one.  And Krakauer is a good writer when he can stay focused on the story.  Unfortunately he pads this simple story way out of proportion.  It's a real insult to the reader.  He adds all kinds of quotes from high falutin sources to try and make the story take on trancendent meaning, and it's just gets in the way.  Also, he just assumes that everyone will fall in love with MacCandless, but that is hardly the case.  He seemed like a nice enough kid, but not nice enough to justify all the praise and attention heaped on him here.  If the people that MacCandless met on the road took a liking to him, then that means he was an outgoing, personable guy, not some kind of saint in training.  If MacCandless was so otherworldly and saintly then the facts could have spoken for themselves, instead of having to smash the reader in the face with the conclusion over and over again.  This story has all the poignancy of one of those evening news feel-good, &quot;kitten in a tree&quot; stories.  I think this book insults MacCandless's memory more than honors it.  I doubt MacCandless would have approved of this book if he had lived.
014100018X|2.0|I'm not sure what all the hoopla and fanfare was about--Chocolat was not a good book.  I'm not faulting its magical realism genre of &quot;Delectable Food Induces Amorous Affairs.&quot;  It just wasn't written very well.  While reading this book, not a moment passed where I didn't get hit with de ja vu.  Even the ending was foreseeable--and the reason definitely is not b/c I've got this great prophet-like power--it's simply that the author does absolutely nothing new with this concept.  This terrain has been mapped far better in other works.  Think Isabelle Allende's &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; or the wonderful movies, &quot;Tampopo&quot; and &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman.&quot;

0800132343|5.0|This is it. The movie that ALL other Submarine movies will be compared to for MANY years to come. It is that good. Let me remind you though that this was a book first, then made into a movie. However, this is one of the FEW movies that does FULL justice to the book--it follows the book almost EXACTLY plotwise. When I first saw the movie trailer for this movie, of course it showed all the depth charge explosions and action, but this movie has so much more than that. The dialogue is excellent, the characters are believable and the filming is top-notch. After watching Air Force One, I couldn't believe that it was the same guy who did Das Boot. In this movie, you'll get to see what it was REALLY like aboard a submarine. Cramped with food, only one bathroom, having to RUN when an alarm is sounded, dishes and whatnot flying everywhere during a 5 hour depth-charging, SICKLY pale faces (the actors weren't allowed to be exposed to light during the filming!), etc. Although this movie is mostly serious, it has its comical moments. But ESPECIALLY impressive is the ending. It is true to the book, for one thing. That last shot before the credits will always stay in my memory. . . . In many ways, this movie is the SAVING PRIVATE RYAN of the submarine movies. In fact, I'd say that, as a war movie, Das Boot is BETTER than Saving Private Ryan overall. The music is wonderfully done and really sets the mood. Also, about 90 percent of the movie takes place on the boat, giving the viewer a sometimes claustrophobic feeling. When they're out on the Atlantic, the actors are getting DRENCHED with cold water. Not the still, calm waters that other dumb sub movies would have you believe in. Some other good scenes involve two submarines in close proximity to each other, a destroyer and submarine encounter, and, of course, the unforgetable ending. BUY this movie as soon as you can--you won't find a better one.
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II vertan who has become &quot;unstuck in time.&quot; Set partly in war-ravaged Europe, post-war America, and the alien planet of Tralfamadore, Vonnegut creates a modern novel unlike any I have ever read.      One of the many creative aspects of this novel is the style in which it was written. Vonnegut writes the story in a series of flashbacks and sporadically jumps from one point in Billy's life to another. He also writes in an easy-to-read manner that allows the reader to understand the story.      Billy Pilgrim is Vonnegut's anti-hero, described as a &quot;filthy flamingo,&quot; and as Cinderella. Billy struggles to deal with himself and the absolute tragedy of the world around him. Billy finds solace on the planet of Tralfamadore. Tralfamadore is obviously a figment of Billy's imagination that he created to escape reality. Tralfamadore is Billy's Garden of Eden; Billy is Adam, and Montana Wildhack, a motion picture star also brought to Tralfamadore, is his Eve.      Vonnegut successfully makes his point that &quot;there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre&quot; by repeating simple phrases like &quot;poor old Edgar Derby&quot; and &quot;so it goes&quot; to make powerful statements. The black humor of the novel also lightens the subject matter and allows the reader to truly appreciate its sadness.      Its thought-provoking themes and clever approach at writing make Vonnegut's &quot;famous book about Dresden&quot; one of the great modern novels that won't die as other attempts have. So it goes.
B00003CXS4|5.0|If you were to chose 1 comedic DVD to buy this year it should be Snatch! It continues where Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels finishes althought it's funnier and more violent, not in a redundant excess like Hollywood movies. <br />It shows off Richie's inginuity with camera editing and storytelling and his facination with the underworld and indie films.  The cast is brilliant, you've never seen B. Pitt as a comedic hard hitting gypsie. It's worth the price of watching Pitt speak! Jason S. is excellent and you almost feel compassion for the 3 hapless black guys. Superb typecasting of Vinnie Jones, Dennis Farina, Goldie ect.<br />In short, it's hilarious, action packed and suspenceful but you have to understand european humour.<br />So Snatch it before your neighbour. On DVD region 2 it has a good extra material disc.
B00004WG4G|1.0|This movie is awful. Beats me why so many people think it's great. In that case people are really down-grading their knowledge of what is a good movie. This movie makes you feel crappy and has no real good story or action. There are many movies better than this one like Dirty Harry or The Straight Story. But this movie is just a feel bad movie full profanity and b.s. and screwed up people.
B00003CX8J|5.0|The movie was a worthy attempt of conveying the true feel underlying the X-Men series of comics. However, as with most movie adaptations, it fails to do so completely. It is an inherent limitation of the medium. As far as the story goes, it is well thought out and portrays the story arc well enough, but the absence of notable characters from the movie doesn't help matters a lot. The contradictions detract from the movie for someone familiar with the comics, but if I were new to the storyline, it would be an enjoyable exercise in fantasy. All in all the movie is well done technically. The DVD is really good and the hidden easter eggs are a nice treat. The picture and sound are first rate and make the DVD an overall good deal.

B00004Z1MO|3.0|I was willing to make all sorts of leaps of faith in this time-travel, back-from-death movie because I was determined to like it!!  (I like Dennis Quaid.)  <br />I was upsest by so much smoking.  I don't like advertising in movies, and I especially do not like advertismeents of a product that killed both my sisters, beautiful women who died prematurely.<br />I was, therefore, gratified to learn that our hero died of lung cancer.  But I didn't figure out how he escaped the death from cancer, not even after watching the film twice.
B0000017CA|5.0|This album is completely awesome. Every song is great, but I'll descire my favorites in a little detail. <BR><BR> Tranquilized is groovy. It is a one of a kind from these guys and they never get this groovy again.<BR> Fingerpaintings Of The Insane is a pretty creepy song, but great, of course. The best part is the deranged rambling at the end followed by singer Dax repeating kill the father, rape the mother, kill the father, rape the mother.<BR> I was obsessed with Jezebel for a long time. &quot;If I took this cigarrette and put it out on you...would you love me?&quot; More messed up but somehow great lyrics about... a prostitute? The song starts out with blast beat on drums and it could be Acid Bath's heaviest moment ever.<BR> Dr. Seuss Is Dead is an evil song. It's slow and brooding and churning until the killer chorus, which makes use of both Sami's and Audie's throats. Three men screaming and double bass, it doesn't get much better.<BR> God Machine is my current obsession. Partly because I understand the lyrics more than most of the other songs, but also because the song rocks.<BR> Both accoustic songs, Scream of the Butterfly and Bones of Baby Dolls are wonderful and beautiful, but I think I'm in the minority when I say Bones is the better of the two.<BR><BR> The band's next album is also a must have, but I don't think it's as heavy. Dax's voice was good enough to make me buy the Agents of Oblivion cd (which is mellow but great) and the Deadboy and the Elephantmen demo (also great, even more mellow).<BR> I've spoken to someone who knows Dax and Mike and he says Acid Bath aren't known out of NO LA. I hope this isn't true (hell, I'm from NYC, so it can't be completely true) because they are one of the best metal bands I've ever heard.
0131103628|5.0|Boy, does this book ever take me back. The first edition of this book was the first book about computers I had ever read. I had an Apple IIe, a C development environment (on 6 floppy disks, which had to be swapped in and out while building), and was trying to teach myself to program. I mostly understood what I was reading - until I got to the section about pointers, which I found incomprehensible. I just couldn't figure it out, until I was reading another book about the Apple II, which explained how the video system worked - then I got the idea that if I took a pointer and set it to video buffer, I could change what was displayed on the screen. Voila, it worked, and I was started on a profession that lasted to this day.<br />I still have that first edition, and years later, in 1988, when the second edition was published, I bought that. Well, there hasn't been a third edition, nor has one been needed. C is essentially a finished product. It does what it was made to do, which was to fill a role that didn't exist at the time of its creation, a language that could be used for both systems and applications programming. At that time assembly language was used for systems programming, and languages like COBOL, FORTRAN, or Pascal were used for applications programming. C could be used for both, and the rift between systems programming languages and applications programming languages was healed, at least until recently (applications programming has largely migrated to C++, while systems programming is still largely done in C).<br />If you want to do systems programming, you just need to learn C. But what if you want to do applications programming? Is it still worth your while to learn C? Well, yes. Here are some reasons why: First, C++ (and Java too, for that matter) are derived from C and are easier to learn once you know C - in fact, C++ is essentially a superset of C, to learn C++ you need to learn pretty much all of C anyway. Second, there are still a lot of C programs around, it is handy to be able to work on them should the need arise. Third, programming examples pretty much everywhere are routinely written in C. Fourth, C is just a neat language in its own right in which to write code; it is small and easy to learn, lends itself to small, fast code, and is available in almost every development environment.<br />So, if you are going to learn C, should you get this book?<br />For the first edition, the answer was easy because the book at that time not only taught people to program the language, it was the authoritative definition of the language - you would have been foolish to attempt to learn the language without it.<br />For this edition, that is not necessarily true - in fact, the book cover now refers to &quot;ANSI C&quot;, as ANSI has taken over defining the language standard, which the first edition of this book had formerly filled. In one sense, &quot;K &amp; R&quot;, as it has been known through the years, is now just another book about C. But in another sense, this book still is C - you can put the first edition and this one side by side (I have both before me now - the first edition is battered and worn, but otherwise very like the second), and be amazed at how similar the two are. Not many changes were made to the language definition between the two editions (all of them good ones), so there was little need to rewrite because of content changes. Most of the changes were for clarity - the chapter on pointers, which gave me so much trouble so many years ago, was the only one completely re-done for the second edition and is much the better for it.<br />So what does this book have that other C programming books do not? Authority. History. Community. The creator of the language wrote this book. For over two decades programmers have learned the language from this book. This is the book that you are more likely to share with other programers than any other. In sum, if you are interested in learning C programming, it should bean easy decision to go ahead and get this book.
B00005B6C9|4.0|Before Hanson and the boy bands there was the Bee Gees, and &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; shows us where the newer models got their ideas from. Although the brothers Gibb are still loathed in some circles, I have always been a biased fan of their music and harmonies. &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; certainly has some great harmonies like &quot;Sacred Trust&quot;, &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, &quot;Walking On Air&quot;, &quot;Embrace&quot; and the title track. I found this cd more catchy than 1997's &quot;Still Waters&quot;, and found the Bee Gees incorporating their past achievements with new ideas. For example, &quot;Loose Talk Cost Lives&quot; reminded me of &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; reminded me of &quot;New York Mining Disaster&quot;, and &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot; was a step in a completely unexplored direction--ragtime jazz. I bought the UK import with the two extra tracks: &quot;Just In Case&quot; and &quot;Promise The Earth&quot;--both worth having. There were even a couple of rockers this time out with &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; and &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot;. It seems there is something for everyone on &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;. Once again, I suspect that the record company and the public will overlook this solid recording because it's the Bee Gees and because most people who listen to popular music think that musicians over 50 have lost their edge, and therefore, are no longer viable. I disagree, and it's a shame that the music made on this disc will receive little exposure or acknowledgement. As a fan of the Bee Gees, I expect &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; to suffer the same fate as 1993's &quot;Size Isn't Everything&quot;, 1991's &quot;High Civilization&quot;, 1989's &quot;One&quot;, 1987's &quot;ESP&quot; and 1981's &quot;Living Eyes&quot;. If you are a fan, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is worth owning, and if you are just finding out about the Bee Gees it's worth looking into.oking into.
0312117337|5.0|As is my usual practice, I'll preface this review with the disclaimer that I am not what you would call a professional practicioner of the tarot.  The cards are nothing more than a hobby for me--one that I picked up after becoming intrigued with tarot during my reading of the Illuminatus! trilogy.  Since then, I have begun to collect decks a few at a time, but I treat the entire pursuit more as an entertaining hobby than any kind of lifestyle. That being the case, you might think that Osho Zen Tarot would run a little roughshod across my sensibilities.  After all, these cards are designed almost specifically for meditative purposes, and I'm not the sort of person who's real likely to put in that sort of time. That's really not the case, I've found.  In fact, I'm not even sure that I'd call this a tarot deck--most tarot cards are designed with at least some divinatory capacity in mind, while these focus more on personal reflection and an exploration of the self. The cards have been reworked to a great extent.  Both the major arcana and the minors have been rewritten and reordered--I have a hard time even relating this deck and other tarot decks.  It is because of this difference that I cannot recommend this deck to beginners--not only is it vastly different from every other set out there, but it's probably also not what you're looking for to begin with.  As usual, my recommendation for beginners is to stick with the Rider-Waite or another deck done in the style, but this one's probably not up their alley. The cards themselves are fully illustrated, with keywords printed at the bottom for aid in interpretation.  The court cards are indistinguishable from the rest of the cards in the suit, except for the presence of directional arrows at the bottom of the card instead of a number.  The trumps are numbered, but don't appear to directly correspond to the majors of other tarot decks. One thing should be noted before purchasing this deck--Osho can rub some people the wrongway.  Reading the book, some of what was included for aid in interpretation was useful, and some was a little disturbing--reminiscent more of cult rhetoric than real guidance for life.  The ostensible purpose of the deck is to relate Zen and tarot--not being a practitioner of Zen, I can't say how well that's been done.  The inclusion of a twenty third trump, however, should be reflective of the tone and attitude of Osho--the twenty third trump is labeled the master, and his picture is plastered all over it. I'm really not sure what to make of this deck, all things told.  I am glad that I own it, and I think that any collector of the tarot will definitely want to add this to their stash.  I'm not so sure about these cards' utility for divinations, but for personal exploration I expect they should work very well for most people.  If you can put up with a little bit of arrogance from Osho, than this deck is probably a good investment for you, with beautiful artwork and an interesting take on the tarot.

B00005B6C9|5.0|Review by tracks:<br />1. This is Where I Came In: Great acoustic sound, going back to their roots!  Very stlistic!  This is a great inroduction to the whole album<br />2. She Keeps on Coming: Robin's solo is great!  Some Lennon-McCarteny's influence!  The verse &quot;She Keeps on Coming back for more!&quot; with he great bass line is sticking in my head!<br />3. Sacred Trust: Now, this is a great song with great melody.  Just listen to it, and you'll fall in love with it.<br />4. Wedding Day: The intro to this song is memorable.  Surely to become a favorite dance music for Wedding's.  <br />5. Man in the Middle: Maurice's style... if you like &quot;Omega Man&quot; or &quot;Closer than Close,&quot; you'll like this one.  It describes the role he is playing perfectly.<br />6. Deja Vu: definitely upbeat and pop-like!  Hittable!  Robin's style... this will be enlightened in later traack, &quot;Embrace.&quot; <br />7. Tehnicolor Dreams:  Barry's nod to Tin Pan Alley.  Very broadway-music or vaudeville like.  Adorable interpretation by Barry.<br />8. Walking On Air: Not a very memorable tune.<br />9. Loose Talk Costs Lives: Yes!  Finally, we could hear a song of Barry going back to his good-old 70s glorious day!  As delightful  as ballads &quot;How Deep is Your Love,&quot; &quot;Don't Throw It All Away,&quot; and &quot;Islands in the Stream.&quot;<br />10. Embrace:  Along with the title track, &quot;Sacred Trust #3&quot; and &quot;Wedding Day #4,&quot; this song stands out from the album.  The hymn-like pop medlody with Robin soaring like an angel... just great!  It makes me think of Cher's &quot;Believe.&quot;  A great one to dacne to!  Hope it'd become a hit!<br />11. The Extra Mile: The orchestra in background is deinitely delightful.  Nice harmmony of the BGs!  Soothing melody.<br />12. Voice in the Wilderness: Bee Gees' attempt for post-modern... it is worth a while to listen to...  <br />Recommeded: 1*, 2, 3*, 4*, 6, 7, 9*, 10*, 11
B00000JMOF|5.0|We're all mis-understood, our opinions, our actions etc. This classic horror flick is like a re-telling of our maker creating us. The monster is in every one of us. The violence we have is taken seriously, but if we take ourselves back to the monster's status, we're just mis-understood and very, very sensitive again.<br />This classic horror film has one of the early cemetery scenes, which is not only a tradition in horror films, but a known gothic thought, though it does go on long before films, it's films that gave even more thought to such terrible things as grave-robbing or people returning from the dead. Frankenstein is perhaps the definitive horror movie. Many say alotta the old classics aren't scary anymore. But I still find Frankenstein to be very frightening. The monster's appearence is amazing. I wonder how scared people were of the film back in the '30s.  I'd also like to point out that Dwight Frye plays the hunchback assisstant named Fritz. Very often mistaken for Ygor, played by Bela Lugosi in future films, though part of the mistake may because in those sequels, Ygor tells us that he was Dr. Frankenstein's assisstant.
0802130208|2.0|Both camps are right about this book. It is both funny and annoying.  The people who think it's funny, love the laughs and ignore the fact that there is virtually no story.  The people who hate it, don't.  I laughed for about a hundred pages and then the book falls into tiresome repetition- Surface activity with no point.   The protagonist is someone none of the reviewers would spend five minutes with.  I couldn't make it past page 150 or so. A more interesting story would inviestigate how the publisher used word-of-mouth about the authors suicide as a marketing tool, allowing fans to credit themselves with coolness for finding this &quot;underground&quot; hit.
B00004LN16|3.0|&quot;The musical growth rate of this band is uncharted -- they swim in a sea of retarded sexuality and sexist lyrics.&quot; (From &quot;Spinal Tap: The Movie&quot; -- paraphrased)  This quote is more than apt when describing AC/DC's latest aural assault; however, it is not enough.  True, the bass and the drums sound like they might as well be coming from a drum machine; to put it more accurately, Cliff Williams' bass isn't even noticable until you finally realize that all he's doing is the same thing he's always been doing -- mimicing Malcolm's rhythm's guitar for that extra oomph.  Yes, the lyrics are stagnant and yes, it is the same old thing they've always been doing,  but it's more than that.  What &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; really is, beyond the Spinal Tap lyrical stagnation and the parody of itself the band has become, is a real genuine blues album.  The bass and drum aren't relavant as music so much as they are as something to keep the beat with.  From the title cut to the final torturous growls of &quot;Give It Up&quot;, they serve the function as the primeval footstomp, the pounding of the foot on the front porch.   At some point in time, AC/DC is going to have to give up playing the arenas and become a blues festival favorite, and this disc is the precursor to it.  &quot;Meltdown&quot; is the kind of raunchy guitar romp familiar to those fans of the band during their bar-brawling &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; days, while &quot;Can't Stand Still&quot; is a simple 12-bar blues played to echo the idea behind the &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; riff.  &quot;Satellite Blues&quot; and &quot;Can't Stop Rock 'N' Roll&quot; are the boys doing their best imitations of, respectively, the Stones and themselves, while &quot;Safe In New York City&quot; (which, judging from the cover of the album, was originally intended to be the title cut until the marketing people put it up against Rage's &quot;Battle of Los Angeles&quot; and decided that AC/DC should never, ever be associatedwith anything safe, which, ironically, is all they have been since Bon Scott passed away) is an ironic comment on America, joining &quot;Damned&quot; and &quot;Ballbreaker's&quot; &quot;The Furor&quot; in the social commentary section of the 'DC library.  The real treasure here, however, lies in &quot;Hold Me Back&quot;, a song which uses an incredibly restrained riff backed by a steady beat to build dramatic tension before exploding into a cutting (predictable) guitar solo by Angus Young, yet still remaining somehow subversive?  How do the guys do it?  I don't know, but something must be pissing them off, and thank God for that.  However, they may want to let Brian start writing lyrics again, because the ones on this album are lame and repetitive.  On the other hand, they'd do just as well to just throw in well-timed grunting noises -- this is, after all, the basic, hard, sexy blues...<br />                                                                            Copyright 2001
B000059ZLH|1.0|This DVD is very poorly made.  I popped the thing in and was 100% dissapointed.  As a huge fan of Dream Theater and knowing that they work so hard for their music, they got extremely lazy on this release.  Come on a concert DVD without the Dolby Digital 5.0 surround sound.  This is a waste of a DVD and is not worth it.  Don't buy this DVD if you dont want to be dissapointed.  It made me sad to see Dream Theater slacking of.. I want my money back.
B000025RX4|5.0|The only Johnny Winter album with no blues tunes, it was cut on a single day. The rapport between Derringer and Winter is incredible! I love the funk of &quot;Ain't That A Kindness&quot;, and the soulful vocal on &quot;No Time To Live&quot;. But my two favorite tracks are probably &quot;Nothing Left&quot; and &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, two Winter originals that show he could write heavy tunes with the best of them. Some real Hendrix influences on several tracks. A fantastic record, but the CD is not as clear as it should be.
B000059MEK|5.0|I wasn't too great a fan of Homework - I loved the thumping tracks like Revolution 909 and Alive, but I thought that too much of it was just unlistenable grating noises that seemed to follow the simple routine of just getting louder and louder.  This is a whole different ballgame, with only Short Circuit sounding remotely like a refugee from their debut. It's more like an up-tempo Air style sound, best showcased on tracks like Digital Love and Veritas Quo. My only criteria is that the last two tracks are a little pedestrian, very average run-of-the-mill house music.
B000002H33|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best Metallica album released.
B000002O4S|5.0|Well lets just say that the sound track is great, just like the movie.  The songs on it are so good and they make me think of the movie.  If your looking for a good thrill buy this!
0679746048|5.0|It's about a girl who trys to commits suiocide and ends up being checked into a mental hospital. She see'a what's it's really like and even trys to escape a couple of times. It's truly is a book that keeps you hanging a wanting to know what happenes next. I thought that it was good because it tells what real teenagers go through. It doesn't sugarcoat it at all it just gives you the cold hard facts. It gives you the innermost thoughts of this girl and shows that teens don't just have soap opera lives but the have real troubles.
B000002BPS|5.0|Face it, Offspring isn't exactly Bad Religion, Black Flag, or Dead Kennedys.  But with this album beginning with a PSA by Jello Biafra (DK), you know that they must have something special going on.  This is my favorite Offspring CD, and I really think it is a cut above their other albums.  They take the songs here a bit more seriously, lyrically; balanced with a wonderful musical intensity that surpasses &quot;Smash&quot;, and wasn't quite matched in &quot;Americana&quot;.<br />The highlight of the CD for me was &quot;Gone Away&quot;, a song about loss.  This song is one of the most personal and powerful songs ever written.  I saw them perform it live at the Benefit for Dennis Dennal (of Social Distortion), and saw several people in the crowd whipping the tears from their eyes.  The CD is worth it for this song alone... in fact, that song is why I bought the CD.  To my pleasure, not only was the rest of the CD not a disappointment, but it surpassed all expectation.<br />I am really bothered by the weakness of music lately, and it's nice to have Offspring around.  Though I am a lover of the harder/political punk, it's nice to see a band that doesn't need to have an issue 100% of the time.  The Offspring are having fun.  Yet, in that fun the \\"punk rock social consciousness\\" message still gets through in a subtle way...once you dig deeper, past the radio hits.  This applies to all of their CDs.  Though Offspring is a lighter punk band, they aren't weak (a weak band is Blink182...which I can't believe are even allowed to pretend that they're punk...more like Backstreet Boys meet Weezer, but I digress...).<br />If you like this CD, may I please recommend that for your next step into the punk world, try \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" and \\"Generator\\" by Bad Religion.  If you like those, then \\"Get Some, Go Again\\"  and \\"Life Time\\" by the Rollins Band.  Once you have these CD's you'll know where to go from there. (\\"Fruits and Veggies\\" by Dead Kennedys and \\"Damaged\\" by Black Flag)
B000002GFT|5.0|Like many of the reviewers, I could go on and on talking about this amazing work, but I will not do so- the music tells the story all too well by itself.<br />What one needs to know about this lp include:<br />1). What a wonderful story teller the late Sandy Denny was. Her remarkable capability to weave her tales is magical. Her vocal on &quot;Tam Lin&quot; is as great a place to begin as any to fully appreciate Sandy's magic.<br />2). Richard Thompson and Dave Swarbrick made a wonderful pairing instrumentally on this lp. Thompson's guiatr work, as always, is dazzling, but Swarbrick's fiddle accentuate Thompson's work and pushed Richard to greater heights.<br />3). The maturity of this already seasoned group. The band had to endure the untimely death of original drummer Martin Lamble as well as Richard Thompson's girlfriend in a car accident. The band persevered, and with Swarbrick and new drummer Dave Mattacks, reached new, amazing heights.<br />There is much more I could write on &quot;Leige and Lief,&quot; but to best understand it comes from repeated listenings of the lp. It is the cornerstone of the modern British folk scene, and is a necessity any any reputable cd collection. Sheer poetry in motion.
B00000JZIK|5.0|The Usual Suspects is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It is peppered with magnificent performances, excellent direction, and a brilliant script(Which incidentally won the Oscar for Best Screenplay). Director Bryan Singer molds a tight and entertaining tale of five men, falsely brought in on charges of a stolen vehicle, then deciding to join forces and commit more crimes. What transgresses is a story of deceit, corruption and murder. Not only is the tale incredibly gripping, it is also downright hilarious at some points, making it such an enjoyable film. Kevin Spacey delivers an amazing performance as Verbal Kint, a scam artist cripple. Gabriel Byrne is great as the tough but compassionate Dean Keaton. Kevin Pollack delivers a strong and razor sharp comic relief role as Todd Hockney. One of the most surprisingly fantastic performances comes from Stephen Baldwin, who really packs a punch in this one. Benicio Del Toro gained rave reviews for his role as Fenster in this film , with due cause. Chazz Palminteri is also very intimidating as the cop trying to bring them down. This film won two Oscars, for original screenplay(Christopher McQuarrie,  can you believe this was an original?!) and very deservedly for Kevin Spacey and his awesome performance. There is a surprise ending that will knock you off your seat. Sorry, can't give it away. Go out and see it.
B000059MEL|5.0|Daft Punk captivated me with &quot;Around the World,&quot; an extremely popular single from their critically acclaimed album, &quot;Homework.&quot;  As I never really got around to buying the CD, (It was high priced wherever I looked.) I was content with borrowing the CD from a friend for a little while.  I was hooked.<br />Along comes &quot;Discovery,&quot; which I learned about by accident, pretty much.  Personally, I've been interested in dance/electronica music lately.  My last CD purchase was Moby.  What a change!  While Moby had some interesting, somewhat ambient, &quot;backroundish&quot; sounding tracks, &quot;Discovery&quot; was all about bassy loops and upbeat tones.  There are only 3 slow-paced songs on Discovery, and they are very enjoyable.  Not to mention the other 11 tracks, which, as we like to say, &quot;rock the house.&quot;  &quot;One More Time&quot; is a great song, with a happy background loop.  The vocoder vocals really come together with the song, bringing a good, optimistic-sounding experience overall.  &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; is vocoder heaven, with awesome rhythmic beats.  (The ride cymbal in the song is a perfect &quot;interlude.&quot;)  &quot;Something About Us,&quot; is lullaby smooth, with the softly digitized voice and rock-a-bye-baby beat.  &quot;Discovery&quot; is simply Daft.<br />This CD is perfect.  Awesome listening, from the 00:01 to 61:00.  I would recommend it to dance/electronica fans anywhere, and if you're not a fan of the genre, this CD will definitely sway you.
0679879269|2.0|Philip Pullman completes his \\"Dark Materials\\" series, and, sadly, there are few surprises. This last book ends as a preachy muddle, and most of the promised climaxes turn out to be anti-climaxes (the foreshadowed betrayal, the end of the Authority, etc.) As radical as Pullman fancies himself, this work also seems to keep trying to reconcile its anti-Christian impulses with Christian morality (dying to self for others, the value of truth, the gifts of the body and physicality). Pullman fashions a straw man of Christianity that actually much more resembles various Christian heresies such as Manichaeism or gnosticism, all the while espousing some of their tenets. For someone who has vocally criticised C. S. Lewis for a tendency to sermonize, Pullman surprising falls to the same temptation, blunting his craftsmanship in this final book of the trilogy.
B00004Z459|5.0|Back in August/September of 2000, when Linkin Park wasn't anywhere near popular yet, I was listening to some of their music. Some songs you won't even see on this CD... some are what I believe to be Euro releases (check out Esal and My December if you can find them).<br />All I am here to say is that this album is great. Most bands (not to discriminate, so I won't name any) last not much more than a month on my playlist. Back in September, when I bought Hybrid Theory (when it was still at a low price at Sam Goody) it took me a little while to start to get used to Linkin Park. Not only have they survived longer than a month on my playlist, they have risen to nearly the top. Each song tells its own story on this CD, that is why it is so great.<br />Disposable music, to some, as much of it is rather loud shouting, even screaming in some parts, as lead singer Chester Bennington gasps out his cries for help throughout the CD. Those of you who have heard One Step Closer and are buying this CD for that, get ready for a ride.<br />The CD starts off with Papercut, a rap-rock styled tune of hidden personalities and what really is inside us all. If you listen closely to each song, listen to the guitar work and Chester's vocal expression, following the stories he tells as he sings his songs, it is truly moving.<br />The CD continues on to One Step Closer, which I actually consider to be the low point of the CD. This song, which brought mass attention to the band, may indeed cause them to sell out more than ever. Although it's a great song, the rest of the CD is far better. Truthfully, I cannot recommend which song to listen to first or last, because I do not have a favorite. Each song is equally motivating and moving, as the stories he preaches get to you after each play. Listen to the lyrics, that's the advice I can give.<br />This is truly the best CD I own. To this date I have yet to skip a single track on it. (Lyrics for all songs are in the CD jacket or at linkinpark.com))
B000002KOO|5.0|I have owned this lp for any number of years now, and it is one that I go back to a lot for inspiration, or just to listen to. After (literally) thousands of listens, the lp still has a vitality and freshness in it that I find inescapable.<br />The original (and only) Fleetwood Mac had undergone several personal and professional changes by the time this lp was released in 1969. Starting off as a pure blues unit, Mssrs. Green/McVie/Fleetwood/Spencer released 2 great blues lps (&quot;Fleetwood Mac,&quot; &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;) that cemented Green as a blues legend while in his mid 20's.<br />The release of the instrumental &quot;Albatross&quot; gave the Mac a huge hit, but also led them slowly away from pure blues from that point on. As this occurred, guitarist Danny Kirwin was added to the band, while Jeremy Spencer slowly became an outcast in the band.<br />&quot;Then Play On&quot; is not a pure blues lp by any stretch of the imagination. What it includes, however, are well crafted songs written mainly by either Green or Kirwin (Spencer did not participate on the lp despite his picture being included with the band's on the inside jacket sleeve), showcasing their immense talents as songwriters and overall musicians. The gorgeous &quot;Oh Well (pts 1&amp;2)&quot; is a clear example, with Green adding a flute (played by his girlfriend) and cellos to the mix. Kirwin's &quot;Although the Sun is Shining&quot; and &quot;When You Say&quot; are typical of his songwriting style- balads. The band does rock out on &quot;Rattlesnake Shake,&quot; as well as the McVie/Fleetwood penned &quot;Searching for Madge&quot; and &quot;Fighting for Madge,&quot; with Green and Kirwin both getting in some tasty licks.<br />The eclectic song list makes for a complete pop lp that holds up well over time. Technically speaking, the recording quality isn't all that great, but that doesn't take away from the competence of both the songs and the band. far from it.<br />Peter Green's swansong with Fleetwood Mac, &quot;Then Play On&quot; is a gem of an lp and should grace every cd collection. A wonderful set of songs played by very competent musicians. Who could ask for more?
B000002KC5|5.0|Randy Newman's first four albums are all five-star classics, but if I was forced to choose my favorite it would have to be this one.  There's an odd love/hate, happy/sad vibe going through this sneaky little concept album that leaves me highly impressed, but also a little uneasy, every time I play it.  But usually, rather than get bogged down in the politics, I just enjoy the masterful beauty of the songs: &quot;Guilty&quot;, &quot;Louisiana 1927&quot;, and &quot;Birmingham&quot; (which has a middle-eight so beautiful that there's no way it could've been written by a mere mortal) are all examples of a songwriter at the top of his game.  Newman would have a hit or two after these sessions, but his work would never again match the standard set by this gem of an album.
B00004XQP4|2.0|Anyone who enjoys the title track, &quot;Warning&quot; should check out the song &quot;Picture Book&quot; by the Kinks on their &quot;We Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; album.  It's the *same* riff, give or take two notes.  Give me a break.  They barely even bothered to change keys.  I liked Green Day, but Jesus, write a song that *hasn't* been written before!  I know there's no market for originality and creativity today, but why not break the monotony instead of jumping on the bland-copyright-infringement-&quot;musical&quot;-trend?!
B000002JS6|5.0|Is good , I'm wonder why only five starts it deserve more certainly. &quot;Let me put my love into you&quot; is one of my favorites, there is a mix of power with maturity, i don't know is something rare. I'm not consider myself an AC DC fan at all, but i like them and there's no doubt they passed to the Rock history as one of the best bands ever.
B00004T37H|5.0|I have always loved anime, and this movie is no exception.  The artwork throughout the movie was incredible, and the characters were deep and easy to love.  The plot was not unbelieveable, if you could just place yourself in to the world of swords and spirits.  The one thing that caught me more than anything else was the incredible voice acting.  For being dubbed in english, the movie was incredible when compared to many other anime titles that were brought to the states.  Now for the down side. The movie has more gore in it than I thought was really necessary.  Still, it was not overwhelming, and did nothing to diminish the worthiness of this movie.
0345404475|5.0|This is a book with, among many thought provoking ideas, about humans loving animals and furthermore, humans identifying their humanity by their capacity to LOVE a fellow living creature: animals.  So what is the problems?  The problem is, humans have decided that androids must be destroyed, there is an industry to destroying them, AND the destroyers, &quot;bladerunners&quot; such as Rick Decker are beginning to think that androids may be just as VALID to live as humans.  Why?  He hasn't figured out just what makes a human a human such as loving fellow living creatures (but aren't androids fellow living creatures too?).  And what of the androids INCREDIBLY strong WILL to live?  Don't they have as much rights to live too??  <br />Humans are keeping android animals in secret to &quot;pass&quot; as real and androids are living in secret and passing as humans, so the ONLY real &quot;defining&quot; way to prove whether one is a human or one is an android is to give a &quot;test&quot; like a lie detector test that shows that one has empathy for a living creature.  Do you kill a coach roach?  Do you recoil at a snake?  Then maybe you aren't human, maybe you are an android??<br />How do you define your humanity when it is defined by your empathy for life as it is in this world?  Then how do you reconcile your job when it is to KILL androids who think that they are alive and do not wish to die?  And how do you live with yourself when you are killing androids just so that you can have money so that your wife can buy a real life sheep so that she can feel that she is more human??<br />This is a maddening paradox and so incredibly inspired that Philip K. Dick is recognized as one of the best writers (sci-fi or not) in the English language. <br />The movie, &quot;Bladrunner&quot; is good but it is not the book.  With the poaching done from the book, and the movie in the mainstream consciousness, the book still stands alone and cut above as what PKD intended.  You can enjoy bothalthough the book is more profound and much more of a puzzle/a Rorschach test of just what you think you see in this book.
0441003257|5.0|GOOD OMENS is clearly one of my favorite books. It does follow Douglas Addams' style, and has many of Pratchett's witty ideas. However, Gaiman adds even more to the copia of that wonderful piece of art. He explores the connections between good and evil, between holy and damned. He opposes and unites God and the Satan and their angeld and demons. He presents a fascinating view of the secular ideas of the modern Christianity and all religion as a whole, touching important areas of humanity. This is an apotheosis of great ideas, wonderful writing style and Gaiman's immensely vivid flux of creativity.
B000050FEN|5.0|Is Se7en a great movie? Yes!  Is the Se7en DVD better than Fincher's other great DVD Fight Club? No. Don't get me wrong, this is a must have piece of DVD collection material because it's Fincher and becuase it has so many goodies packed in. But to this day there hasn't been anything in comparison to Fight Club in terms of price range that just offers that much. Toy Story Toy Box is the only thing that I know of that can put a hurt to Fight Club, but it'll cost you. Se7en is totally worth it, do yourself a favor and click the &quot;Buy Now&quot; button. You won't regret it.
6304936362|2.0|I enjoy patriotic films, am a warbird buff, and went to highschool with Matt Modine. However IMHO this movie was barely watchable for many reasons. Scene one, bomber returns from mission, skids to a stop at the airfield, and detonates. Uh... there's no gas, bombs, or bullets on that B17, what exploded? Later in the movie they seem to show a crewman get ejected from an aircraft due to cabin decompression... these planes weren't pressurized.<br />It's nice that the moviemakers took the effort to remove the chin turret from the B17 they used for filming. Kudos for that. But then to have Matt make a big speech during a bomb run that he's worried about a german school right next to the factory... What's that, a pc sanitization of bombing for audiences of the nineties? I believe CEP for a norden bombsight was a quarter mile, and don't you think that the Germans would be smart enough to move their children during a bombing raid??? Yeesh.<br />This movie placed 90's attitudes and 90's adults in WWII cliches. A better movie might have attempted to capture the essence of the teenagers who left the farms to go to war in these aircraft.<br />I can't think of why anyone would watch this movie when 12 O'Clock High is still available
B000001GKC|1.0|Not so great a conductor. This 7th is for the casual Brucknerian at best. It's a good easy &quot;ReadersDigest&quot; version of a sublime work. If you need true inspiration and are willing and able to &quot;understand&quot; Bruckner - try the EMI/Celibidache/Munich or the DG/Furtwangler/Berlin Phil. True wizards of the very highest order.
B00005B6C9|5.0|BACK TO THE BASIS, WITH GOOD PERFORMANCE, SPECIALLY &quot;THIS IS WHERE I CAME IN&quot;, &quot;DEJA VU&quot;, WITH &quot;TECHNICOLOR DREAMS&quot; WHICH MIGHT BE USE IN A FILM. AFTER A BRIEF PERIOD, THE BEE GEES RETURN WITH ENERGY AND QUALITY IN THE CD; WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH THE ENHANCED VIDEO. PERHAPS, IN MY OPINION IS MISSING ONE OF THE BEST SONGS, &quot;JUST IN CASE&quot; WHICH I WILL TRY TO SEARCH AND BUY AN IMPORT CD. I WAS LUCKY TO SEE A VIDEO WHERE BARRY SING THIS SONG, IT IS FANTASTIC. I WIIL KEEP AN EYE WITH THE NEW REALESES OF THE BEE GEES. MANUEL, A PERUVIAN IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, USA.
078324228X|1.0|This movie is nothing more than a disappointing load of garbage, better-suited to be found on network television as a palatable-for-the-masses made-for-TV movie brought to you by Hallmark. <br />Plot holes abound. To wit: it was never explained what the motivation was for Dan Hedaya's character's life-long vendetta against the Hurricane. Why all the effort? And every scene involving the Canadian troupe was cringe-inducing.  A contrived group of feel-good saviors.  If the movie is to be believed, the Hurricane was basically saved by a bunch of overacting cartoon characters. The story would have fared better had those characters been Scooby and the gang. <br />Every \\"dramatic\\" portrayal was comical at best, except for Denzel's which was plain infuriating. Here he plays the same character he plays in every movie.  It's frustrating how poor this movie is and that it opened to glowing reviews. An Oscar nomination? Pshaw - what a laughable notion. <br />It's deplorable that a compelling true-life story about an unconquerable human spirit could have been botched so profoundly, but there is NOTHING redeeming about this entire production. Usually if I rent a stinker I'll finish watching it on principle, just to get my couple of bucks worth.  Not this time.  This is the ONLY movie I ever returned without getting my money's worth.  I didn't even bother rewinding the tape in order to avoid the chance of it getting stuck in my VCR.  <br />Read the book instead.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Finally, after seven long years of wiating one of the best anime films ever is going to be released to DVD.  In short Akira encounters an escaped experiment and has a bizarre power activated within him.  simply one of the best anime ever, with truly astounding art work and visuals.  If you are even slightly interested in anime this is a must own.
B000001ELL|4.0|I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD AFTER I HEARD THE SINGLE &quot;I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU&quot; AND FOR THE MAIN REASON THAT KISS HAD JUST RELEASED A NEW ALBUM. I'VE BEEN A LOYAL KISS FAN SINCE I WAS SEVEN AND THESE GUYS WERE MY SALVATION FROM THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS THAT LIFE PUTS US THRU. KISS WAS A WORLD THAT I COULD ESCAPE TO AND FIND COMFORT AND HAPPINESS. DYNASTY HAS MANY MEMORABLE MOMENTS AND SOME FILLER AS KISS OPENED THEIR CREATIVE MINDS TO THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL WORLD OF DISCO. &quot;I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU&quot; IS KISS MIXING HARD ROCK WITH A DISCO BEAT AND COMING OUT WITH A SUCCESS. IT'S ONE OF THEIR BEST SONGS FOR THE REASONS OF IRRESISTABLE MELODY,CAPTIVATING LYRICS,AUTHORITIVE DELIVERY,AND A CATCHY PULSE THAT IS HARD TO RESIST. THIS IS A DANCE SONG THAT TRUELY ROCKS. THE OLD STONES CLASSIC &quot;2000 MAN&quot; BECOMES A RAW ROCKER IN THE HANDS OF ACE WITH SOME CHUCK BERRY STYLE GUITAR SOLOS THAT BURN AND A SOLID VOCAL INTERPRETATION OF THE LYRICS. &quot;SURE KNOW SOMETHING&quot; IS A BALLAD THAT SWINGS WITH A SEXY DISCO BEAT YET IT HAS THE ATTITUDE AND TENDERNESS OF ROCK N' ROLL IN THE DELIVERY AND LYRICS. &quot;I'VE BEEN A GAMBLER BUT I'M NOBODY'S FOOL...SURE KNOW SOMETHING...YOU TAUGHT ME THINGS THEY NEVER TAUGHT ME IN SCHOOL... SURE KNOW SOMETHING...NO ONE CAN MAKE ME FEEL THE WAY THAT YOU DO&quot;      ONE OF THEIR BEST. &quot;HARD TIMES&quot; IS A COOL ROCKER THAT FINDS ACE TELLING US WHAT IT WAS LIKE LIVIN' ON THE MEAN STREETS OF NEW YORK WHEN HE WAS A TEEN AND WHAT THOSE LIFE LESSONS TAUGHT HIM. IT'S ABOUT NOT GOING BACK WHEN YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. SOME RIGHTOUS STUFF. DYNASTY ALSO CONTAINS THE POP METAL MELODIC SPELL OF &quot;MAGIC TOUCH&quot; AND THE BAD LOVE CHAIN BREAK OF &quot;SAVE YOUR LOVE&quot;. DYNASTY MAY NOT BE THE BEST KISS ALBUM BUT IT CONTAINS MANY MOMENTS TO SATISFY AND A FEW SONGS THAT CAN STAND WITH THE BEST OF KISS. WORTH A LISTEN.          O.F.
0375500901|5.0|Daniel Silva has yet to disappoint me. The action revolves around the Arab/PLO/Jewish conflict. As novels about that political situation are of little interest to me (my preference is the USA hardboiled detective), it takes an extraordinary tale to captivate me the way &quot;The Kill Artist&quot; did.<br />As with Mr. Silva's other novels, I could not put it down. It's one of those books you steal time for. The pages fly by.<br />The characters are richly portrayed and fairly complex. You get to know all of them. On both sides, the major players are flawed, and the reader must decide who truly wears the white hat. So much evil has been perpetuated on both sides...there is plenty of blame to spread around.<br />Excellent cat and mouse plotting. Great attention to detail in the spy versus spy aspect and the physical settings.<br />While it gets a bit muddy at the very end, I applaud this one and highly endorse it to those readers who are fascinated by thrillers that do not stretch credulity and place you as a reader in the middle of the action.<br />Mr. Silva is an excellent story teller, who does his homework.
B000002O7C|3.0|Don't get me wrong; I definitly like the music on this CD, with The Hymn to Red October being the showcase. But there was so much more music in the film. Why was the instrumental version of the Hymn omitted? This too-short CD could easily have been expanded. My biggest disappointment is the omission of the Red October crew singing the Soviet National Anthem-certainly integral to both the plot and the score.
B00003CWN3|4.0|This movie was difficult to watch and it had a disturbing, unoriginal plot, but Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny are absolutely brilliant. Hilary Swank should have won hands down and I applaud the Academy for NOT being politically- correct and giving the coveted award to the deserving actress, Hilary Swank rather than the expected winner, Annette Bening for AMERICAN BEAUTY. As for Ms. Sevigny, she was brilliant, although one can't make a very good case for her with Angelina Jolie against her for her equally haunting performance, in GIRL INTERUPTED. Sorry Chloe, Angelina was just great. Over all, an incredibly disturbing film, which probobly should have been rated NC-17. Lastly, I congratulate the producers and financers of the film for taking a risk, and creating an exceptional film.
B00005B6C9|3.0|Buoyed by the wonderful acoustic based title track I held out high hopes for this latest Gibb release. But alas, aside from the aforementioned title track, Wedding Day and Just In Case (import version only) this CD is more a collection of solo material. Robin's Deja Vu, Embrace and Promise The Earth (import only) all stick to the &quot;europop style&quot; he explored on his solo single &quot;Juliet&quot;. His, She Keeps On Coming, is more effective and actually rocks. Barry's Sacred Trust and Loose Talk Costs Lives echo his work with Streisand and Dionne Warwick. His Technicolor Dreams explores 30's music hall jazz as Paul McCartney did with When I'm 64, Honey Pie and Your Mother Should Know. Maurice has 2!! entries on this CD. The first is typical MG, Man In The Middle. The other, Walking On Air, tributes those great Brian Wilson songs of the 60's. The production is more consistant as the Brothers have jettisoned the muli-producer experiment per Still Waters. Lyrically of course the Gibb's rarely stray from love song territory be it a fast or slow tempo song.That is fairly fustrating at this point in their careers. You would have thought that men, all in there 50's, would have some interesting observations to share about their world. In the end this record adds to the Gibb canon of impressively &quot;crafted&quot; pop songs. It's just that &quot;craft&quot; seems to have taken over from &quot;inspiration&quot; the last few years.
B000002KO1|5.0|Further proof that American's can't Rock: Ohio-native Chrissie Hynde had to go to London to find musicians to play her music.<br />Luckily for her--and us--she found James Honeyman Scott, who flat out plays on this LP.  Losing him was a disaster this band never quite got over; this is their only complete LP.<br />Two of the tracks, &quot;Precious&quot; and &quot;Brass In Pocket&quot; became FM staples, but everything here is solid.<br />Where did this band learn time signatures?  There's a bit of 4/4 here, but what is &quot;Tattooed Love Boys&quot;?  <br />To me, &quot;Kid,&quot; with it's bass-string guitar riff, and the straight-ahead rocker &quot;Mystery Achievement&quot; are the best tracks here, but they are all solid.  This is a can't-miss CD.
B000001GXI|5.0|This is to me the best recording of the most divine musical creation ever; Die Zaberflte is music touched by the hand of God, and this recording, though imperfect in certain areas, is still my choice as &quot;favorite CD to take with me to a deserted island..&quot; The sound-quality is needless to say not up to par with the standards of now-a-days, but not bad either. Especially the female vocal cast is not up there with the best on the marked (Rita Streich as Knigin der Nacht would have been sublime..) but the male singers more than makes up for that! Hotter and Fischer-Dieskau are brilliant, but it is the &quot;Wonderful Wunderlich&quot; that steals the show with the best Tamino, I have ever heard... Bhm and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra plays grandiose, beautiful and with lots of time on their hands, and it works perfectly, as far as I am concerned, although some may prefer a quicker, more brisk tempo.. The only contempory alternative to this Zauberflte, is the one with Willian Christie and Les Arts Florissant on Erato, where the sound-quality is top-notch, the music is performed on period instruments for a more &quot;intimate&quot; feel, and the vocal cast is above average all around... But the Bhm version is still the best...
B000001FXV|5.0|Along with the Who's LIVE AT LEEDS and the Rolling Stones GET YER YA-YAs OUT, Bob Marley's LIVE! stands as one of the greatest live LPs ever recorded.<br />The version of &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; on this CD is thE ultimate Bob Marley recording, full of love and passion, tender and sweet but still tough and rock solid.  A perfect performance.<br />&quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; shows the opposite end of the Marley spectrum.  It is pure revolution and, if you live in Babylon and don't feel your hair standing on end during the chant at the end of this record, you ain't listening.
B000005J08|4.0|This is musical anarchy!!! Not since &quot;Trout mask replica&quot; by Captain Beefheart have I heard an album, that challenge peoples pre-concieved notions of what music is!! At first listen, this album seem like random noise, but with repeated listening ones ears slowly begin to sense the myriad of details actually inherent in the music. The ultra-short outbursts of sound, and the more &quot;melodic&quot; re-workings of well-known musical themes makes for a TRULY unique album, featuring some of the most talented musicians in Jazz/Avantgarde. On par with Zorn`s other enduring masterpiece &quot;The big Gundown&quot; but somewhat more contrvercial!!! Few albums can claim to introduce something totally new to the musical world... &quot;Naked City&quot; is such an album!
052594527X|3.0|The book is very well written.  However, I went through the entire book waiting for something to happen.  While most of the characters were very well developed, the character of the artist was not.  I was hoping to get a better understanding of his position and feelings, but nothing.  I actually felt the book was pretty boring.  I am enjoying the Girl in Hyancith Blue much more.
B000001GPX|5.0|First off, I have to say thanks to DG for remastering this masterpiece and selling it at mid-prize, giving all the chance of experiencing this cornerstone recording of Beethovens signature symphony in all its glory! ...And what an interpretation it is... Like Celibidache, Kleiber was a fierce perfectionist, and therefore only recorded a handfull of classical works, and nearly all were sublime, but to me, his and the Vienna Symphony Orchestras rendition of Beethovens 5th symphony remain the most perfect... Perfect music performed the perfect way... What else matters?
1577311523|5.0|This book is a profound (although repetitive) condensation of basic Buddhist philosophy.   Presented in a clear and simple manner, it addresses the basic questions of existence and provides us with cogent answers.  You can feel Eckhart's gentle and compassionate smile from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this book to any serious seeker.  Fully understood, it may be the last book you'll ever need to read.
6305841861|5.0|As great as the VHS was, this DVD is even better.  Includes a wonderful doctumantary and histerical commentary.
0783240287|5.0|I have seen a few broadway shows in the past, but when  I saw Joesph for the first time in Salt Lake City I was blown away.  I instantly went out and bought the DVD and every Sunday my family and sit down and watch it togather.  The set up with the school kids watching the show in the school auditorium magical and touching.  Go Go Donny and I hope to see you in Salt Lake city again.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|The best horror film ever made makes it to the great status of DVD!  A horrifying, intense movie.  With options, all Deadites need to but this.
B00000IMYA|5.0|You do not have to be much of a jazz fan or an Ellington fan to recognize this is one of the most exciting live performances ever recorded. Huge kudos to Columbia Legacy for producing the original recordings of the entire 1956 performance -- if you listen to the studio mock ups (included on Disc 2) that previously passed for the Newport concert, you can appreciate how this album went from patchwork disaster to, in its current form, absolute nirvana.<br />The songs are especially well chosen -- from Black and Tan Fantasy, to Take the A Train, to Mood Indigo and Skin Deep, these are some of the best of the best. As great as the songs are, the performances will really make you up sit up and listen. Johnny Hodges, Willie Cook, Clark Terry, Cat Anderson and especially Paul Gonsalves with his legendary solo turn in the performances of a lifetime. Ellington's piano is characteristically brilliant.<br />A big surprise: recording quality is exceptional for a live performance from 45 years ago -- and in stereo, nonetheless (1956 was very early for commercial stereo). I heard only a few places where microphone placement could have been a bit better, but this stands head and shoulders above much of what was recorded in that era.<br />One minor suggestion: while I admire Columbia's completeness in retaining the old studio-doctored tracks, and applaud the extensive liner notes (five stars in themself), I would have been happy to have only the original concert -- the rest is just a document of how overzealous studio teams could ruin something that was perfect to start. This is really nitpicking, though. Maybe it is important to document what happened, as well as the happy ending.<br />If you even think that you kind of might like jazz even slightly, or if you are new to Duke Ellington, I would strongly and urgently recommend this album as a starting point. This recording could stand alone as an homage to one of America's national treasures.<br />You need this album.
0767817710|5.0|In a western town, a female gun-slinger appears with a chip on her shoulder and vengance in her heart.  She enters a quick draw contest and quickly climbs toward the finals.  Excellent acting by Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, and Russell Crowe.  Sam Raimi fills this movie with amazingly interesting and effective shots, keeping you at the edge of your seat.  Would definately watch over and over again.
B000002KB8|5.0|Sometimes, I am in the mood for the later, more polished work of this band.  But when I am in the mood for pure, raw, unadulterated Black Sabbath, nothing else will do but this album and Paranoid, for these are the 2 albums that defined the dawn of a band and a new era for rock 'n' roll.<br />This album was not called &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; for nothing.  It defines their ultra-heavy, forboding style with the very first song, the appropriately titled &quot;Black Sabbath.&quot;  All of us fans know how it goes: first, the light sound of rain, then the growing sound of thunder in the background, and then the bell...one ring, then the second, then the third, then the fourth which is slightly faded, then louder thunder, then the fifth and louder bell, then...WHOOMP, simultaneously the first earsplitting guitar chord crash by Tony Iommi, the first electrifying bass chord thump by Geezer Butler, and the first thunderous bass-drum thump by Bill Ward.  This begins the first Black Sabbath riff, which continues with the bell still ringing in the background, till it softens up a bit.  Then Ozzy Osbourne starts to sing, in his most pained voice, &quot;WHAT IS THIS, THAT STANDS BEFORE ME?&quot;  Ah...THIS is the pure, raw power of Black Sabbath the song, on Black Sabbath the album, by Black Sabbath the band.  What an all-time classic!!!!<br />After that epic opus, we then get treated to a nice harmonica tune that begins &quot;The Wizard,&quot; before the rest of the band joins in.  Who ever said that bluesy harmonica can't coexist with crunchy fuzz-guitar riffs? :)  With Black Sabbath, ANYTHING is possible!!<br />The first of two jam-sessions on this album, &quot;Wasp/Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B.&quot; has Black Sabbath showing off their roots while being alternatively mystical, creepy, and sleazy.  By the now, all of us fans know the classic riff to &quot;N.I.B.&quot; in our sleep.  As Ozzy says, Oh yeah!! :)<br />After the wonderfully wicked &quot;Wicked World&quot;, we get to the grand finale of the album:  &quot;A Bit Of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning.&quot;  This is a 14-minute-plus extended blues jam workout that you can just picture how much fun the band had while playing it.  It still sounds as fresh as it did back when it was recorded...hell, if you play it loud enough, it sounds like the band is right there in your living room!  It is not for the faint of heart, and never was.  It has some of the most blistering lead guitar work you will ever hear, and some of the fastest bass and drums. And the bluesy, I-don't-give-a-damn vocals by Ozzy Osbourne, who ends it all with &quot;I was born without ya, baby / But my feelings got a little bit too strong...just a little bit too strong.&quot;  Thus ends one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever made.  Just think, it only took them 16 hours to record it all!  That's what I call pure, natural talent. &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; defined a new form of music, and that is BLACK SABBATH itself. :)
6305095566|5.0|Sam Raimi's film will grip you by the throat, make your heart pound, and keep you at the edge of your seat.  Bruce Campbell is just lovable as the ever bumbling, almost cowardly Ash.  This is one of the best horror films I have ever seen.
0441172717|5.0|If you haven't read this because you were put off by the &quot;cult&quot; status of Dune, don't be. I delayed reading it for years because I usually avoid cult classics and overhyped books. But the moment I started reading Dune, I was captivated.<br />This book creates an entire world and society (what I love best about sci-fi, when done really well.) And this book has an epic struggle of Good and Evil. The bad guys are really BAD. The good guys are complex, heroic and vulnerable at times. There are plots, sub-plots and counter-plots.<br />Some fascinating concepts are introducted in Dune; an order of women who control breeding of superior human beings and influence politics--the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, human savants who replaced computers when computers were banned from the universe for their &quot;dehumanizing&quot; effect. And the Fremen, a desert people who are fiercer than the trained killer army of the Padishah Emperor.<br />This is the most exciting science fiction book I ever read, and is one of my favorite books of all times. If you haven't read it, you are in for a treat. Dune is complicated at times, but always worthwhile.
6304819935|5.0|Great film!  Bruce Campbell does some amazing acting in this film.  Gotta love Sam Raimi's unique filming style.  A great balance between horror and comedy.
B00000IQBM|5.0|This movie is excellent.  Period.  I have read Stephen King's novel and I strongly prefer Kubrick's version of the story.  The made-for-TV version of this film, which closely followed King's novel, was TERRIBLE.<br />Two elements make this an essential film.  First, I beleive this movie displays Jack Nicholson at his absolute best (however,all the actors in this movie do an incredible job).  Secondly, Kubrick's films are both beautiful and effective.  Just like any other Kubrick film, you sit back and take in the wonderful sets, acting, camera work, lighting, and dialogue.  There is no other film like this...
B00003CWHS|4.0|A great film made ever better for the fact that it isn't cut.  The original ending is wonderful to see.  The deleted scenes are also a definate plus.  Loses one star for not having the S-Mart ending.
B00004U5SC|3.0|Let me start by saying the movie alone is 5 stars in my book.  Sure, a little corny, but aren't all Westerns?  <br />Anyway, there are enough detailed reviews already here to give a good synopsis of the film itself.  I am rating this as a DVD only, and sadly must give it only 3 stars.<br />The picture quality itself is excellent, and the settings and backdrops in this movie take full advantage of the DVD format.  Sound is fine, but not spectacular.  Where the DVD falls flat is in the &quot;special features&quot; portion.  Unfortunately, George Stevens Jr. (The director's son) and Ivan Moffatt (I'm still not clear on exactly what his role was other than being a friend of George Stevens Sr.) present a rambling, ad-libbed summary that is often irritating in that their descriptions are frequently out of sync with the scene at hand.  Ivan Moffatt, in particular, borders on the terrible.  His heavy British accent is so thick it's disturbing, considering we're watching an American Western.  And his comments are almost inane at times:<br />Shane: &quot;A gun is a tool Marian, no better or worse than the man using it&quot;.<br />Moffatt comment: &quot;Oh, the NRA would like that&quot;.<br />Marian: &quot;We'd be better off if there were no guns left in this valley&quot;.<br />Moffatt comment:  &quot;They wouldn't like that&quot;.<br />Thanks Ivan, for interjecting your own personal (and totally irrelevant) liberal political beliefs in a film review.<br />More than that, Moffatt and Stevens Jr. are continually harping  (almost nostalgically) about how when Stevens returned from the war he had a different view of violence and wanted to portray the dangerous image of the six-gun in the movie (apparently he was peeved at all the youngsters he found running around with cap-guns).  So how does Stevens de-glamorize guns?  By making them seem louder and more powerful than they really are!  (In another ridiculous statement, Moffatt describes the scene where Torrey is pulled backwardsby wires when he is shot by Wilson to show the &quot;powerful effect a .45 has&quot; on it's victim.  While the technique used is interesting trivia, the common assertion that people are &quot;pushed backwards&quot; by bullets is false, as any ballistics expert will tell you.  Alas, this technique has now been copied in dozens of other movies.<br />My point here is that if George Stevens intended Shane to be an &quot;anti-gun&quot; (or even &quot;anti-violence&quot;) film, then I think he failed miserably.  After all, even if little Joey is &quot;too young to go loaded&quot;, all Joe Starret's problems are ultimately solved by fisticuffs or bullets.  Lastly, by rambling on about Steven's pacifistic leanings, Stevens Jr. and Moffatt never really delve into the nuances of the love triangle, which is a major part of the movie.<br />This is a great film, and you really don't have to listen to the documentary piece anyway, but the &quot;extras&quot; on this DVD don't justify paying full price.  If you must have the DVD, wait for a sale.
0783225733|5.0|I bought the DTS version of this movie.  Like other DTS versions (ie, Saving Private Ryan), you get the movie and NO extras.  It comes down to quality versus quantity.  DTS requires a lot more info stored on the DVD, leaving little or no room for the extras.  But, its worth it - you can rent the lower quality DVD to see the extra &quot;stuff&quot;.<br />The movie is a true story, featuring great special effects, brilliant acting, and another great directing effort from Ron Howard.<br />So, when are we going back to the moon!
0385470819|5.0|&quot;A Time To Kill&quot; was written in the middle 1980's by John Grisham, but was set in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi, on the late 1970's.  Jake Brigance, the protagonist, is a lawyer who is trying to win a case that can help his career while at the same time endangers himself, his family, and any other people invovled with the case.  The case involves a black man, Carl Lee Hailey, who violently took the law into his own hands by murdering his ten-year-old daughter's two white rapists.  The entire town has their own opinions of the black man killing the two white men and of Jake because he took Mr. Hailey's case.  The town of Clanton versus racism is one of the conflicts of this novel.  Racism is the antagonist against Jake and the angered father that sought revenge for his daughter's pain.       The themes are that although people think racism is a thing of the past, it is still alive in some people and very dangerous.  Another theme is that when the law is taken into your own hands, it may seem like the best and possibly even the only solution at the time.  However, when it is all said and done, it may not be the best way to solve your problem after all.       This book was amazingly well written to be the first novel of a new writter.  I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys to read.
B000001ELP|3.0|A lot of people HATE this record. A lot of people LOVE this record. Both are probably wrong, although it's perhaps better than its detractors may admit. KISS tried a concept album. KISS is not the smartest band (musically speaking) in the world. No one is denying this. It's apparently based on some short story Gene Simmons wrote. But don't let that worry you -- there is really nothing on this record that forwards a story of any kind. These are really just somewhat unusual KISS songs, written and arranged as a little bit more than typical KISS fare.<br />But one big distration on this record is the pretension pouring from it -- especially from Gene. It's obvious he took this project very seriously, to the point of being comically somber thorughout most of it. The pseudo-philosophy of &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot; is laughable and the full chorus singing out on &quot;Under the Rose&quot; hardly inspires comparison to a great moment in opera.<br />Musically, as is ALWAYS the case, Paul does better. His &quot;Odyssey&quot; feels right, even if the words are comic book-level at best. His &quot;The Oath&quot; is a good setup for what could have been a much more interesting album than &quot;The Elder&quot; turns out to be.<br />So KISS tried to make an album for grown-ups. It doesn't really work -- but it doesn't suck either. It's got some nice songs with some bad lyrics -- thus making it a lot more most other KISS albums than some people realize.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Dante Spinotti, who was also behind the visuals on Heat, is amazing.  The Insider, as a trained cinematographer, is one of the best and inventively shot films I have seen in a long time.  <br />As well, Michael Mann does an amazing job overall, of directing these two fine actors.  He also is one a director I hold in the highest esteem.<br />Whatch this one - do not let the synopsis prevent you from seeing it because you're afraid it may be &quot;boring&quot;.  Give it a chance and you will find it to be very exciting and full of both energy and touching moments.  <br />Absolutely outstanding.  Crowe deserved &quot;Best Actor&quot; for this, and Mann &quot;Best Director&quot; at the Oscars.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden came back the old-fashioned way -- doing what made them famous in the first place -- and doing it REALLY well. This is simply a classic Maiden record. In fact, as an album it easily holds its own with the classic Maiden records. The formula is still here: long songs that start slowly, build to something heavy and then rock back and forth between the two. The lyrics, though, are a little more solid although still entrenched in the usual Maiden mythos: monsters, airplanes, mythology and war.<br />If Bruce Dickinson ever wants to prove he's metal's finest singer, this album just may do it. He's gotten better with age, his voice is huskier, his tone more dramatic. He's telling stories and does so masterfully.<br />This album does not miss for the first 6 songs. The opening &quot;Wicker Man&quot; feeds directly into &quot;Ghost of Navigator&quot; which deques right into the title track. In a music world where albums are usually nothing more than 2 or 3 good songs sandwiched between filler, this album succeeds in building momentum with each track -- climaxing with a true classic Maiden epic &quot;Dreams In Mirrors.&quot;<br />And in between we get another classic called &quot;Blood Brothers.&quot;<br />The fact that the album's final few cuts are a little forgettable can't hurt the power of the first half. This is as good an album as Iron Maiden has ever done. Nostalgia act? I think not!
B00003CXN4|4.0|I must say Traffic had one of the most beautiful and touching endings I have ever seen.  A powerful movie, one that is well worth the last shot.  <br />Del Toro is incredible in this, with his lost eyes and tired face - he is extremely convincing as a jaded Mexican police officer.<br />The opening shot completely took me with its grainy, high-speed look, but from there you become accustomed to it.  Fabulous hand-held action through-out, this is one not to miss.
B00003CXB2|5.0|&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is one of the great epics. A film that is captivating in its scope and grandeur. Director David Lean has here his best film. It is a remarkably well-made film with a fantastic screenplay by Robert Bolt and dynamic performances by Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif. But what makes the film a masterpiece aside from the great dramatic elements, is the incredible visual quality. The vistas are breathtaking and it will be a very long time before anyone films the desert like Lean did with this film. It is even more breathtaking a movie to watch when you know this was released in 1962, long before computer graphics were essential to visuals. Everything is REAL, alive and thundering. And whatever beautiful visual side-effects we see in the sand or caused by the heat caught in the background by the lenses, is quite natural too. The action sequences are also great to this day. This film is epic and grand, heroic and exhilarating yet beautifully artistic. And there is of course, the romantic, wonderous musical score by Maurice Jarre. It is one of the great masterpieces of the cinema. A true classic that still stands the test of time. This new DVD edition is fantastic and the making-of documentary is fascinating and very informative. It is a worthy treatment. Here is one of the truly great films.
0790729628|4.0|An amazing sci-fi movie that demonstrates alot of depth not only through its storyline, but also through its images.  Ridley Scott's use of &quot;selective focus&quot; is amazing during one of the most powerful scenes in the movie - a scene between Rutger Hauer and the actor who played his maker.  Superb!  <br />As well, the special effects put alot of todays CG animated movies to shame.  Model effects are still great when done properly, and dare I say, they still sometimes pale CG in quality.<br />Overall, Ridley has created a rich world, as he normally loves to do.  We see this as well in Gladiator, though that one was not quite as good as this...
0393317552|5.0|In &quot;Guns, Germ and Steel&quot;, Jared Diamond presents the rather simple thesis that the rise of complex societies has been influenced primarily be geography.  I say &quot;rather simple&quot;, because the author goes to great lengths to prove it.  There is actually nothing simple about his argument, as geography encompasses climate, suitability for agriculture, native fauna, natural resources, etc.  Furthermore, he needs to revise his argument for North and South America, Australia, Africa and much of Asia, to account for  different variables in each locale.  <br />Finally, after laying out and backing up his thesis, he applies it to a walk through of modern history, and identifies why Europeans were so successful in dominating the rest of the globe.  He is no apologist for brutality and slavery, but he correctly points out that the diseases the Europeans brought with them were the overwhelming cause of death and defeat for indigenous cultures around the world.  In turn, these diseases were the result of the urban lifestyle Europeans had.  A lifestyle supported by easily farmed grains and domesticated animals.<br />Of course, it's all much more complicated than that, and Diamond does a superb job of walking the reader through his thesis in well written, easy to digest chapters.  A background in evolution, biology or sociology will certainly enhance the readers understanding/enjoyment but it is by no means necessary.  My only complaint about this work is that Diamond tends to belabor points long after his case is made.  A zeal for thoroughness, however, is a small complaint about an otherwise excellent work.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|Lets be honest guys, if this wasn't Maiden, it wouldn't have got 5 stars from Kerrang. Its a solid CD with a few excellent songs, but a lot of the songs are boring, drag-outs. The Wicker Man, Ghost Of The Navigator and Brave New World are the only good songs - the others don't really hold for themselves. Songs such as Nomad, Blood Brothers and Dream Of Mirrors get boring quickly, and they don't make me wanna listen to them more than a few times. I tried to like this, but compared to older Maiden stuff or Bruce's solo albums, this ain't that great. Sure, it's better than anything else Maiden released in this decade (aside from Fear Of The Dark which is of a similar standard), but that isn't saying that much. I listen to Maiden loads and loads, but not this CD.<br />If I had to describe it I'd say a cross between late 80s and early 90s Maiden cross with the more recent Dickinson albums. Unfortunately, this isn't as good as either of those (Aside from 1990's No Prayer For The Dying album which was quite atrocious).<br />I do love this band and they were without any doubt they were THE band of the 80s. But their heyday has gone, and this doesn't rescue it. Go listen to thier old stuff, but this is a bit of a collection completer, and I would be kidding myself to honestly think otherwise. To give this a rating as good as the ones that I'd give Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, Number Of The Beast or Powerslave would be ridiculous. This simply is not in the same league. Go buy Live After Death for a great introduction to Iron Maiden.
B00000K19E|5.0|When you get this movie on DVD you win a lot more: from an every scene explanation from the director, to a behind the scenes and making of it. The sound, the video, everything is just the way it should be. It's like the first movie you should get on dvd and test your equipment. Choose any scene, and if it doesn't sound ok, change your receiver. It'll be hard if any other movie gets special effects as good as this one.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is one of those CD's that defines what music should be.  Ms Arie utilizes the gift of verse that evoke a warmth that I haven't felt in quite a while in music.  Come Back to the Middle, Nature, and Ready for Love leave me wanting to here them over and over.  This one will be in my CD player for quite a while.
6305558167|5.0|...&quot;Excalibur&quot; is easily the best film about King Arthur and in fact, the best film about knights in general. While it is far from perfect, it captures the essence of Malory's stories while adding a brooding, violent nature to the film. Boorman also perfectly blends realism and surrealism which every great fantasy film should have a firm grasp on. Add to this some nice battles, and timeless music and you have a great (if not perfect) film.
B000000OAL|3.0|On their self titled debut, Queen shows the listener a hard rocking band with a definite prog-rock influence. Soaring guitars, fantasy influenced lyrics, and driving vocals dominate but there are hints of the sophistication found on later Queen recordings. &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; and &quot;Liar&quot; stretch the band musically and &quot;Opera&quot; style harmonies are heard throughout the CD. An interesting start to what became a truly original career.
B00003CXPD|4.0|You have to ask yourself how lucky Stephen Daldry was to find this particular young gentleman, Jamie Bell, to play the lead role of &quot;Billy Elliot.&quot;  I can't think of another youthful actor ( much less a dancer ) who could have been so successful in carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Julie Walters does an excellent job as crusty teacher.  Some of the best scenes in the film are the moments when student and teacher start in on the verbal battles that can leave you laughing and crying at the same time - a wonderful change from the calm, caring, though eccentric teachers of American film.  The soundtrack of the film is very well done, as is the choreography for the dance sequences.  The father, brother and ( especially ) the slightly loony grandmother are wonderful characters, as are Billy's best friend Michael, and the teacher's young daughter.  <br />Regardless of the media hype ( which actually does Billy Elliot a disservice with it's use of chliched exclimations ), Billy Elliot does have flaws, some of them glaring and very nearly unforgivable.  The script often tends toward the normal, the expected, and even the trite.  The background of the coal miner's strike is appropriate, but director Stephen Daldry doesn't always make it clear why he dwells on it for quite so long.  DVD specific ( I assume ) there are some problems with sound - often the music covers voice, and the volume between scenes is so radical that it's wise to keep your remote in your hand so that you can alternately hear what's being said and avoid bursting your ear-drums.  <br />For all of the above, &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; finds &quot;Moments of Grace&quot; frequently, where you may burst out laughing, or wipe a quick tear from your eye.  They are quick, they are short, they are instant, and they are brilliant - and they ARE worth it - every penny and ever moment and every flaw ... most of them thanks to Jamie Bell ( watch out for his smile - it only happens a few timesin the movie, but it's a killer, folks. )<br />Conclusion:  Ignore the media.  Ignore the hype.  Discard your expectations.  Get &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; and take it for what it's worth - in my opinion - a wonderful, sweet film, filled with moments of glory that are well worth your time and effort and appreciation.
B000002GOZ|3.0|Too bad Adams wasn't a bit more courageous on this live recording. It would have been interesting to hear Adams and his guitar take on these songs. Instead, we get Adams, his band w/string accompaniment by Julliard students making for just another greatest hits package with a twist. Some interesting versions of Adams' hits are to be found, but it all adds up to nothing new. However it is very listenable; particularly the bluesy &quot;If you wanna be bad-You Gotta be Good.&quot;
0811826848|4.0|Years in the making, the long awaited &quot;Anthology&quot; by the Beatles is sure to please the casual and diehard fan.  The surviving Beatles tell their own story, with printed excerpts of interviews with John Lennon telling his tale.  The text is eminently readable, with the book divided into year-by-year sections.  Pictures abound, many never before published, showing the Beatles in concert, at home, and in the studio.  Colorful layouts add texture and scope to the book.  There are a few drawbacks: the coffee-table size format does not allow the reader to curl up with the book for long periods of time; many sixties-era Beatles documents are printed over text or pictures, making many of them difficult to read; and there are few captions with the pictures, forcing the reader to flip back and forth to the index to identify the photos.  All in all, however, one cannot argue with the importance of the book as a document of the sixties and a document of the Beatles.  Young adults interested in music or the sixties should also find this an essential read.
B000002GGU|3.0|Adams' work is usually easy to sum up; tunes you'll remember, lyrics you'll forget. Love in its many forms, (lost, unrequited, passionate,etc.) is the main topic on Reckless. Many of Adams' most popular songs are found on this disc(&quot;One Night Love Affair&quot;,&quot;Heaven&quot;,&quot;Run To You&quot;)but it's the last five that make this disc worth getting. From the blistering nostalgia of &quot;Summer of 69&quot; (probably Adams'best song ever)the anti-new wave rant of &quot;Kids wanna Rock&quot;, Tina Turner's contribution to &quot;It's Only Love&quot; the confused narrator of &quot;Long Gone&quot; and the dumpster solo on &quot;Ain't gonna Cry&quot; this CD finishes with the edge you wish was present throughout.
B00000JCOV|2.0|This used to be a 5-star review, and I used to really love this band. No, I didn't listen to them because of all the \\"angst\\" and \\"image\\" everyone complains about. I used to listen to them because I like the music. I'll give them that. This band was kind of like a gateway for me. When I first heard this cd and Iowa, I thought they were way too heavy for me. But I grew to like them. And then, I started browsing this site for other heavy bands. Then I discovered bands like Opeth, In Flames, Morbid Angel, Meshuggah, Iced Earth, Death, and countless other great metal bands that you never see on TV or hear on the radio. And here is where Slipknot's problem is.... compared to all these bands, they are just weak! There is a ton of nu-metal stylings, no guitar solos, and it just doesn't sound as good as any of these bands. So while I don't really hate Slipknot like many \\"true metalheads\\" do (they did get me into heavy music after all), I can't deny the fact that they are nowhere near good as many of these underground bands. If you like this band, check out some of the other bands listed. I guarauntee you will like them a lot more than Slipknot. They will open up a whole new world of metal bands to you.
B00004Z400|5.0|Alot of people will tell you that Around the Fur is a better album than white pony.  If they tell you this ... because they are dead wrong.  This album is a huge step forward for the Deftones, and one of the best albums released in 2000.  From Chino's incredible vocals in Digital Bath, to the extremely hard Elite, then to the great mix of aggro-rock and progressive in White Pony, it just doesn't get much better than this.  Every track is great in it's own way and the album moves like a train - no stops, no getting off.  If you can, grab the early special black or red version for the last song on those CD's - it's called The Boy's Republic and it may be the finest deftones' songs yet written.
B000001AKM|5.0|This album starts out with 3 newly recorded songs of 1992, &quot;Do it to me&quot;, &quot;My Destiny&quot; and &quot;Love, Oh Love&quot;, and then moves on to his greatest hits. The 3 new songs are just as wonderful as the others, with that classic Lionel sound. This is an album for anytime and any occasion. Not only are his solo hits here, but also some with The Commodores. The 20 page booklet includes all lyrics and a few photos of Lionel. A must have for all Lionel Richie fans.
B000031WD9|2.0|Oh yes it is funny... but in a very explicit extreme way!<br />Now-a-days it is not easy to create a commedy or to make viewers laugh! So it would be very easy to make a cheap type of commedy by building it with a sexual foundation!<br />It is a successful commedy but with zero morality!
B00005B6C9|5.0|At long last, the Brothers Gibb have crafted an album that surpasses all their earlier efforts. The sound is more basic (less synthesizer) and more mature (simplifying all their talents). The range is varied, but always maintains an upbeat, rock filled tempo. &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; and &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot; are amazing surprises of excellent R &amp; B rock. Is this the Bee Gees? Even the ballads are mainstream upbeat, such as, &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, &quot;Embrace&quot; and the oddly named, &quot;Loose Talk, Costs Lives&quot;. Although, the title track has been chosen as the first single (in the rest of the World), any track could make it, (save for &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, which is a pleasant, but odd novelty song). Maurice even tops himself with the Beach Boys styled &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air&quot;. There are lots of surprises here and there is absolutely no way to try and pick which songs will be chosen for air-play. They are all that good.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|Look here, the songs available on this DVD are great and are the most of Whitney's best. So for Whitney's fans this DVD is a must!<br />Now for those who want more songs, than what is available on the DVD... we shall hope for another DVD release but this doesn't underestimate or degrade this DVD!<br />As for the DVD extras I didn't find it to be all that... <br />I wish they had Whitney's GREAT NEW SONGS with E. Iglesias &quot;Could I have this kiss forever&quot; and the other one with G. Michael &quot;IF I told you that&quot;!
0679879269|3.0|I regret that my remarks cannot be all positive. Pullman's work is filled with exciting and fun concepts. A universe with multiple dimensions. In Lyra's world, everyone is connected to an external anima/animus-like soul. Lyra has a golden alethiometer (a truth meter). In Will's world, there is a subtle knife capable of cutting through the fabric which separates the various worlds. In the first two books, the Church constitutes the bad guys, which I find not unreasonable. But use of the word &quot;catholic&quot; shows a lack of good taste. But the third book shifts from Church-bashing to God-bashing, and Pullman's lack of good taste is replaced by a lack of good judgment. There is absolutely no excuse in a fantasy for young people to bash the God of the Bible. In the well over 1000 pages of the trilogy, only a few pages are needed to taint the work. And it's so unnecessary! The biblical fallen angels cast out after the war in heaven become the good guys. From there, Pullman has a good fallen angel name the biblical &quot;Creator, the Father, the Almighty, etc. etc.&quot; as the evil Authority who is a great and power-hungry LIAR! The Authority uses Enoch as his muscle (his evil Regent). So the Holy One of scripture as well as the holy Enoch become the personification of evil. In the end, the biblical god is portrayed as a senile old man who is &quot;demented, powerless, fearful, crying, whimpering, groaning, without a will of his own, who finally dissolves into extinction in exhausted relief.&quot; By weaving such garbage into the very structure of the story, Mr. Pullman requires the reader (a young person) to contemplate and tacitly accept great blasphemy in order to maintain an imaginative, emotional connection with the storyline. I am so disappointed. Magic is fine. Witches work. Harry Potter is delightful. Pullman's work could have been as well. But unfortunately, it is damaged goods.
0446310786|1.0|I reckon this be anoth'r classic that doesn't deserve that status.  For the first 28 (out of 30 chapters) nothing happens.  Finally, in the last two chapters, you get the world's most predictable ending that you spot from a mile away!  It's a crime this book is called a classic.  Symbolism my (....)  Harper Lee HOPES you find symbolism in this shallow book.  I strongly urge you not to even read this book for free at the library; your still getting ripped off.
B000000OUE|5.0|this cd is one of the best metal cds i own. everything is just great here. the pounding electronic style beats put up quite a speed, also making this very danceable. the riffing is heavy and funky, putting up a great metal feeling. robs deep growling voice does the rest. but the lyrics are not quite that what you would expect from a band like this. everything seems kinda satirical, nothing is taken too serious. a great unique cd. much better than everything rob does on his own. also get their first &quot;la sexorcisto&quot;. if you like this i recommend: ministry, machine head, spineshank, static-x and powerman 5000
0060282983|1.0|I read this book when I was 10, and it is one of the dumbest books of my youth.  It really isn't anything special.  But the thing I hate the most is this;  How come they praise the pig for being special when the spider should be the one getting the attention?!?!  Kids will hate this book, including me and the whole 5th grade.  Also, Kids will not pick up on any morals; adults will not find it interesting either.
0060926317|1.0|It is sad that people still continue to buy and praise this book. For those American readers who may not understand the issues, please understand that the book is offensive to many Aboriginal people - the very people Morgan claims to be celebrating. It is not a minor squabble about whether it is true or not (although you should know that Marlo Morgan herself admitted it was fiction when confronted by members of the Dumbartung Aboriginal corporation). This matters to Aboriginal people - they are tired of being misrepresented, tired of having white people exploit theem for material (or personal spiritual) gain. To suggest they should forget about it is to fail to understand the long history of misrepresentation and the terrible consequences this has had for Aboriginal people. Remember it is a 'real' people you are talking about, real people with feelings who have suffered oppression for 212 years, people who are always talked 'about' by others and not allowed to speak for themselves. Saying it is a metaphor for a deeper spiritual truth is not good enough - Aboriginal people are not metaphors. Read the Dumbartung web site (in a earlier review I think) and discover for yourself.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Having to wait so long for a Iron Maiden album that had the true line up was very sad, considering they had some of the most historic albums ever. I was vey happy to see bruce dickensen back, now ill tell you this album was not incredible but it reminds me of seventh son of a seventh son, very melodic. I love the wickerman and blood brothers, however outside of these two songs, you dont get much, but who cares these 2 songs carryn the album and lets just all be happy we got another maiden album to put next to the master pieces like powerslave, killers, etc... Iron Maiden will go down as a band that was way ahead of there time and believe me they where, they inspired bands like metallica and megadeth before they were anyone in this business. Bottom line this album is a Maiden album go get it. THE WICKER MAN&gt; DAN THX
B000006NPY|5.0|It is very simple... If you cannot appreciate this album you are not a Smashing Pumpkins fan.  Billy Corgan was ahead of his time in creating Adore, and it may not be for everyone, but it is certainly touching and powerful.  Obviously most people have a problem with this type of music, because poor taste is in healthy supply among the majority of the public.  Just look at what IS popular these days : (
1558908420|5.0|Why this movie didnt get more attention is beyond me! This movie was a low budget movie that Stallone did while receiving a pay check of about $60,000 just to work with the likes of harvey Kietel and Robert De Niro. It is the best acting performance Stallone has ever given. He was a vulnerable Sheriif who was not the guy who takes out 50 people by himself, and maybe that is why most people have never seen this movie. Shame on you because it is a great movie, it is a cop drama with some heavy hitters in it including ray Liotta. For the love of god next time you see this movie on the shelf pick it up or better yet buy it you will be surprised it has some wonderfull acting in it. Dan thx
0553296981|4.0|Anna Frank is a 15 years old when Nazi start destroying Jewish people and their belongs. In this time Anna and her family were hiding in the basement. Then Anna decided do keep a diary, because there wasn't anything that she could do except read or write.  Things became worst day after day. They couldn't go out side to do anything. When they feel hungry, there was one girl who helped them by bringing water and food. But that's the girl who told the Nazi solders that they were hiding. Anna and her family live there for almost two years. After around two years the soldiers came and took all of them. They put them in concentration camp, while they were there; her mother and her brother were killed. When she left their house Anna didn't take her diary with her. So she didn't had a chance to write about the things that was going on in camp.<br />When Anna was at the basement, she wrote about how things were bad to them. How they can't be what they wanted to be. She felt that there wasn't nothing that she could accomplish by just hiding and writing. But she didn't stop writing until they came and took them out. So after a while Anna got some kind of diseases and died.  When the whole family died, there was only their father who was alive till the last minute.  Then after Nazi destroys all the things that Jewish people have and killed around 60,000 them. Finally thanks to USA, they became free. I think the leader of Nazi killed himself.<br />When Anna's' father got out of concentration camp, he went to the basement that they hide and found her diary. He took and read it. After the peace that he got, he decided to publish it. This book was distributed for many countries, especially in Eroup.  It was also written to many languages too.<br />This book teaches us many things about Nazi even if we didn't live in that time. We can learn how Jewish suffer from this problem and be able to survive from it.
B000002TPS|5.0|Second to Rust In Piece this is one of the better Megadeth albums out there. Although Rust In Piece is the best Megadeth album ever, this album comes in at second because the first four songs are incredible and drive the album. In the mid 90's Metal was dying in Los Angeles, and I just happened to be in a store when I saw this album and I didnt even know megadeth had a new one out. I was amazed at the maturity they showed in there music, and yet it was not as commercial as countdown to extinction. I think train of consequenses is a incredible song, and this album is a blessing compared to risk, so if you liked countdown and rust in piece then you wont be dissapointed with this album at all. god I cant wait for the return to hanger 18. DAN thx
0060191325|2.0|It took me almost 6 weeks to get through this book because the writing is so freaking boring. Yes, unlike many people who talk about this book all the time, I have read the book from cover to cover, front to back, the whole enchilada and to be perfectly honest I am not any different than I was before. This book did not change my life and I can't understand why it was a best seller for so long.<br /><br />The premise of the book is simple: men and women are different, so different they might as well be from different planets. The author only got the equation half right. Men and women are different, but we aren't from different planets. Yes, we are different physically and have different thought patterns and emotional structures, but we are all human. This is one area where this book fails (as so many other relationship books do as well) pointing out the differences in the sexes, but failing to illustrate the similarites. Of course, it fails in a lot of other areas, too.<br /><br />Most of the helpful tips are things that should be obvious to anyone who has any maturity at all (talking about conflicts, giving people their space, etc.). The writing is bland and more repetitive than the bass beat in techno music.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can understand how some people could be helped by reading this book. For someone who is emotionally immature or who has never learned basic relationship skills, this book could be useful. However, other than that, don't waste your time buying it and if you want to read it, go to the library.
B000002UUX|5.0|Every now and then you run into a album that you can truley consider great. Of all the megadeth albums this one is the pinnacle of what is a great band. I have never heard up until that point in 1990 nor have I heard anything like it since then. It is in my mind a true musical masterpiece, how often can you pick up a cd and listen to every single song and then play it over and over and over again. After almost 12 years it is one of the best true metal albums ever made, and should be given more credit as it kicked anything elses behind in that era. if you are a true fan of megadeth then you know what I mean when I say that this album is a riff driven musical masterpiece that truely showed us why dave Mustaine is a geniuse and we all forgive him for RISK. Dont even think just pick this one up, if it came out today it would still blow you away. DAN
B00000I7AJ|5.0|I absolutely love this album! I didn't really find anything too bad about the vocals, except that at times they were hard to understand (but every metal album suffers from this a little). My favorite songs are Stand Alone (track 5) and Consequences (Track 6). Also of note is track 3 (can't remember the name offhand).

6300183211|5.0|Even though it appears I'm about the 3,000th person to weigh in with a review of this underrated gem, here goes...  Not only is it a disgrace that Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for his gritty, balls to the wall performance as a Cuban-refugee-turned-Miami-hood, he wasn't even nominated!  Back in the mid-80's, when my hometown first got cable, it seemed as if &quot;Scarface&quot; was on 24 hours a day, a constant and somewhat fascinating primordial ooze of blood, cocaine, and the F-word.  For a while, my friends and I took to talking like Pacino's Tony Montana, in some sort of twisted homage to his performance for the ages.  Clutch this video closely to your heart.  In the politically correct environment we now find ourselves shackled with, Hollywood will never make another one like it.
B000056K04|2.0|This album sounds like &quot;warmed over&quot; Peter Gabriel meets Pearl Jam.  This was my first Dave Matthews Band album and will certainly be my last!
0679879269|4.0|A great book, but be sure to read the first and second books beforehand. The political stuff, like religous hypocrasy, will fly over kids' heads but the book is still good for everyone. This book isn't as cosy as Harry Potter and is more believable, but Coulter's unexplained personality change throws part of the story. The same goes for Asriel's &quot;revolution&quot; - a dissapointing anticlimax.<br />Overall, great story, valid points, too many holes.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay's album was very good for a debut.  There is a lot of good songwriting present here.<br />The thing that I was most surprised about (and thrilled) is that they do not sound like U2, nor any other artist.  There are a lot of unique sounds on here and I believe that they will be a lot better in the future.<br />Dont think that this is the best album of the century, it isnt, but I think that they have a lot of potential.  Its very good, no matter how negative I may sound.  Its just that its a little too English poppy for me, but if you like the Travis type of sound, this is one of the best albums of the year.<br />I can reccomend this to basically anyone and their tour this summer promises one of the best ever.  (They are touring with Grandaddy, who is exellent)
B00005B6C9|5.0|Barry, Robin and Maurice were, and are, masterful musicians, arrangers and songwriters.  Unfortunately, their burn-out was so severe it has lasted several decades.  I was one of those casualties.  Really could not stand to listen to much Bee Gees music, especially anything from the late 70s.  Nevertheless, it did not mean they were/are any less talented.  Their new album confirms that.  It is my first purchase of a Bee Gees album in over twenty years....and it's a winner.<br />The pre-release buzz on this album was pretty good so I decided to give it a try, and was most pleasantly surprised with how much of it I liked.  Stand-outs include &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; which, impossible as it may sound, reminds me of a cross between David Byrne's Talking Heads and The Beatles.  Hard to imagine, I know.  Other winners are the rock-tinged &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and the upbeat &quot;Walking On Air&quot; and &quot;Embrace&quot;.  <br />A problem for this album may be in getting radio airplay since their burn-out backlash is still an issue.  I worked in radio for years (am in TV now) and understand some of the issues radio station programmers need to address.  Preventing tune-out is a big one.  This album is good enough that several cuts should get airplay, perhaps without identifying the artist so there are no pre-judgements before the music is heard.  The musical styles here are varied so format appeal depends on the cut.<br />Radio's resistance to a stigmatized artist is not new.  I remember the angst and hesitation many AOR stations went through in the early 1980s before adding &quot;I Know There's Something Going On&quot;, the first solo effort by ABBA's Frida.  It was a great rock song, but she was stereotyped as part of ABBA.  In the late 1980s, New York's WPLJ took a chance on a new Donny Osmond release that launched his comeback.  They played his new release, identifying him only as the &quot;mystery artist&quot;.  The switchboard lit up with callers wanting to know the artist and the song eventually went Top 10.  Both the station and Donny won.  If given a chance, several of the new Bee Gees compositions could do similarly as well.<br />Airplay will be the critical component in the success of this album.  However, lack of airplay should not in anyway dissuade one from purchasing this, or at least giving it a listen.  This is good stuff, and I recommend it highly.
B00000IAU3|4.0|In some ways, Dido can do a lot better than she did in No Angel.  Not only is she a master vocalist (one of the best of pop music, really) she is also a master songwriter.  She has written excellent songs for her brother, Rollo Armstrong (known as Dusted to the music world).  However, her full talent is surely no shown in No Angel.<br />While her actual song-writing deserves a lot of credit, its the vocals that get me, theyre something like Britney would sing, with just a pinch more taste.  While I think its a matter of time before some actual good heartfelt lyrics are on her album (besides from Honestly Ok on this one).  I just hope that that comes sooner than later.  Her new titles sound a little more promisisng and a new album is on its way as i type. <br />Dido's music is unique and unlike other things.  While people hear the core, pop-diva sound, there is that sound that's simply electronic, and Dido does have a DJ, Pete Meiser.<br />Dido will soon branch over into more eerie things.  I think that we will be hearing more beats from both Meiser and work branching over more toward her brother, who has been in the music business much longer. A lot of good will be coming from this young lady.
B000056K04|4.0|Although I cannot claim to have been a DMB fan as long as others can, I do love their music and can comment on this new album. Firstly, yes it is a change from previous albums, with the focus of this album being electric guitar, with violin, bass, and sax taking  signifcantly smaller roles. The sound is different, but different does not mean worse, in comparison to other DMB albums. As a musician I realize something that others might not, that artists have a driving desire to progress and evolve their art. So, for those of you who want to hear 'Crash into Me' listen to that song, dont expect to hear it repeatedly on new albums. All great bands, the Beatles and U2 to just name a few, changed their style tremendously over the years, since there existed the need to progress and transform. In reference to Everyday, there a number of great titles, such as I Did It, Space Between, So Right, When the World Ends, Everyday etc. Do not avoid or set aside this album because it doesnt sound exactly like past albums. Consider it for what is worth, on its own merit. Those who keep an open mind will not be disappointed.
0790737345|4.0|There is an offbeat sense of style and passion which sets &quot;City of Angels&quot; apart from most other romantic films, a sense that comes from the movie's refusal to cast flashy, young stars amidst a cliched plotline. Instead, the film enhances a highly original story through two very enticing leads, Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, who have a pulsating chemistry that is intrical to the overall effect of the film. Director Brad Silberling's visual style and an enigmatic soundtrack all converge to create one of the best romances of all time. <br />The story begins by introducing us to Seth, an angel who brings freshly dead souls to Heaven (&quot;I always asked them what they liked best about life&quot;). He is not alone on Earth: there are many other angels on the planet, circulating throughout the city of Los Angeles in black trenchcoats, making their way to the beach to watch the sunset... heck, their local hangout is the public library. We are witness to many different situations, deaths and one convenience store robbery, where the angels interact in order to instill their sense of calm over people. <br />Seth is a very complex character, his charming and calm attitude and his handsome looks making him an ideal angel. On his arrival to take a dead hospital patient to Heaven, he meets eyes with Maggie, or thinks he does (she can't see him), and he is immediately drawn to her beauty. He later learns that if he wants her to see him, then she will in her own time, which, fortunately for him, is sooner rather than later. Maggie does not believe in angels or God, so the many strange occurances that surround her meeting and her getting to know Seth will test her faith in her beliefs. <br />Of course, this big question is whether or not they will end up together in the end. This is something that the movie toys with immensely as it examines the relationship between Seth and Maggie, which is more fragile than you would think. Maggie's insecurities about her newfound love andSeth's naivety of the ways of human life provide some heartwarming and sometimes tear-jerking moments which further enhance the bond between them. And once Maggie finds out about his origins, the relationship takes an entirely different avenue, which I'll leave you to discover on your own. <br />There is a nice amount of chemistry between the two lead acting talents. Nicolas Cage is the perfect choice for Seth: his angelic looks and his sensitive demeanor evoke feelings of serenity and calmness while the audience is graced by his onscreen presence. His character is very complex when it comes to making new discoveries about life, and Cage brings out all of the confusion quite convincingly. Meg Ryan is outstanding, as always, in her role of Maggie, who is required to experience big shows of emotion. Ryan does this superbly, and one scene that comes to mind takes place in an empty hospital stairwell, where Maggie cries for her patient. This scene gives the actors a chance to show what they are really made of, while subtly bringing to life to budding chemistry between the two that will culminate later on. <br />Two supporting roles of this film also add to the movie's story. Dennis Franz plays a fallen angel who chose to leave his heavenly status for a woman he fell in love with, and once he meets Seth, he begins explaining his experiences to his new friend in order to help him get a grip on his feelings. Andre Braugher plays Seth's confidant angel, who helps him keep his head on his shoulders. Both of these characters offer interesting insight and element into the secret life of angels, which makes us think of what really does exist out there. <br />The overall sense of style and grace that the movie charms us with seems a bit more sophisticated than most romantic films. The images are easy on the eyes: we are given everything at a steady pace, which allows us to pay more attention to the love story. Silberling's brilliant shots tell the story in such intricate and enlightening ways. Tight shots of the actors bring us more into the emotion of the film, while beautiful beach shots of the sunrise as underwater filming are breathtaking. Seth's &quot;fall&quot; will certainly be talked about for its wonderful composition: there is such a momentus amount of intensity and awe in that moment, which makes it one of the film's defining turning points. <br />The soundtrack is also a major key element to the success of this film. Most of the music centers around the theme of loneliness, wanting someone back, and (what else?) angels. The most evocative song of the film is Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Angel,&quot; which rings outs its haunting melodies and meaningful lyrics to a scene that practically melts my heart. The score for the film, done by Gabriel Yared, combines new age influences with modern beats that keep it interesting and emotional. The score certainly fits the film, as do the many songs. <br />I deeply enjoyed &quot;City of Angels.&quot; This is a movie that I can sit through and not have to worry about bashing: it has all the classical elements of a romance with a new twist, which is carried out meticulously by superb acting and a tremendous directorial effort. This is the best supernatural romance since &quot;Ghost.&quot;
0440178002|5.0|James Clavell's Shogun ranks up there as one the greatest stories ever told.  It tells the story of an English Pilot(John Blackthorne i.e. Anginsan) who makes it to the Japans and wins favor with a powerful Japanese daiymo (Toranaga).  It also tells the story of a forbidden love as Blackthorne falls for his beautiful married interpretor Mariko. A very compelling and powerful story that takes you to a different time and place.  This a a story for the ages!!!!!!
B000002ULO|4.0|He Makes It Seem So Easy. This Album Is Great From The Beginning To The End, I'm Not A Big Fan Of Paul's &quot;Slow&quot; Songs, But The Ones Here Are Very Good. It's Not As Good As Mccartney Or Ram, But It's Close!. Young Boy, Flaming Pie, Souvenir &amp; The World Tonight Are Highlights.
078322740X|5.0|Forget what the uptight film critics had to say.  If you enjoy Steve Martin at his best, and if you're a fan of Goldie Hawn, this movie's a keeper.  Is it silly, goofy and a bit predictable?  Yes.  But who cares?  It's a comedy, and that's what's comedies should be.  Martin, Hawn, along with a wonderful supporting cast make for a memorable movie!...
B00005B6C9|5.0|You know when a CD is good when you have 2 of the songs constantly running through your head.  I love the style of Technicolor Dreams, sound something like a vauldvillan tune. I have been a fan of the Bee Gees since 1978 and this is undoubtly the best album they have ever made.  Although I like the falsetto sound, it was never my favorite.  I am so glad they went back to the early sound.  This proves what I always thought, The Bee Gees will never go out of style.
B000003S0P|4.0|I gave 4 stars only because of   'Providence',it doesn't seem to fit well on this album. The other 4 songs are totally awesome. I own about 700 albums and most of what I bought doesn't stand the 'test of time',THIS ONE DOES. If you're thinking about buying &quot;RED&quot;- GREAT CHOICE!
B00004RJ71|5.0|Man this movie was great, actually is was the greatest movie of all times better then The Matrix or Even Whatever you think is the greatest. This movie is all true nothing in this movie hasnt happened. I live in California and i see this every day and i know what this movie is telling and that is that these young people are stuggling through life some make such as Paco and some dont such as Miklo and some just go through some terrible times and bearly pull through such as cruz. I think there is no other movie that cap top this movie i have it on; vhs,dvd,Downloaded on my computer i just plain love it and i yhink if u havent watched it your in for a very good movie.
B000023VR6|3.0|I have heard alot about this album and finally decided to listen to it. I was very unsatisfied and only 3 songs on the album caught my attention. Dre utilizes a similar format for all his sounds. Considered by many to be the greatest rap producer of all time, Dre fails to live up to his billing. Misogynistic and explicit lyrics aside, the beats are pretty decent as with all Dre albums. Dre CANNOT recapture the power and feel of the original Chronic. The genius of the first album is it Perfectly Captured the Moment. It was like walking into COMPTON and taking a picture. You can't TRY to reproduce a classic. The orginal Chronic was great cause everything just happened to come together. For those who don't know DRE can't really rap. I doubt he even writes most of the music, according to Daz, Dre rips off alot of other artists sounds.What Dre does have is a good ear and a good feel for sound levels and effects. I am very glad I didn't buy it, MTV once again determines the sales of most albums. Keep in mind what SUGE KNIGHT said, Dre doesn't do alot. In 14 years as a rapper he has only completed about 5 records! 2PAC did five records in about 20 months! Dre also avoids utilizing the reggae bottom coupled with high end key boards and loose funky beats which was his signature sound. Should have stayed with the FUNK. Maybe George Clinton should save the day again?
0684171600|5.0|There's a whole demographic group out there of students who are not being exposed to this book, who are growing up bereft of any knowledge or feeling for terms like \\"shiver me timbers\\" or \\"smart as paint.\\" One measure of a great book is whether kids like the story itself, and then if there's even more to it to appreciate as an adult. By that measure, this belongs in a well-fitted library and on the floor next to the bed of all your kids.<br />The colluquoy between Israel Hands and Jim Hawkins is as precise a look at good v. evil, materialism v. spirit as you can find, and comes out effortlessly in their brief encounter after Jim has gone back to the ship while the battle between the good guys and the pirates is waged on the island.<br />Whatever else went through Stevenson's mind as he lay dying of consumption in Indonesia after writing this, the way he squares off these concepts amid the diffuse clamor of a bloody mutiny, and using a conversation between a young boy and an illiterate but lethal pirate, is a lasting monument to substance in the midst of what is essentially children's literature.
B00002Z88D|3.0|As bizarre as the idea may seem, Metallica backed by the San Francisco Symphony doesn't really sound all that weird--most of the time, anyway.  Michael Kamen, who has worked with innumerable rock bands on their orchestrations (including Metallica on the Black Album's &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;), takes the helm of the SFS, and for the most part his orchestrations fit in neatly with the songs here, particularly songs off the Black Album and &quot;Load.&quot;  A couple of earlier songs also fare well, most notably &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls,&quot; which to me exemplifies the effect Kamen and Metallica were trying to go for with ths show.  However, there's a number of occasions when it seems like band and orchestra are going in two totally different directions, and the results are a cacophony.  The worst is &quot;Battery,&quot; in which Metallica plays at hyperspeed and the orchestra tries in vain to keep up (and sounds horrible in the bargain).  Hardcore Metallica fans bemoan that &quot;S&amp;M&quot; is just another sign of the Great Sell-Out, but those less emotionally involved will enjoy a lot of this, especially side two, which will hold the more familiar songs for non-fanatics.
B000050XEI|5.0|Ever since the first time I laid my ears upon Enya's music, I was hooked. I ended up purchasing every CD she has and then some. I found it quite amusing as some reviews claimed this CD's the same old boring thing. Well, this is what you'd expect from her when you bought the CD right? I mean you could always get the best selling Now That's What I Call Music series of CDs if variety is what you desire. But being you purchased this CD, I assume you have a heart for Enya's style of music. I would be disappointed if Enya wastes her beautiful vocal on a pop single. Wouldn't you?
B000000W5N|5.0|STICKY FINGERS, like AFTERMATH before it, marks another major turning point for the Stones. And I'm not just talking about the move to their own record label. LET IT BLEED was the last Stones album Brian Jones played on. I doubt that anyone fully realized how much he would be missed. Jones gave the Stones a pop sensibility comparable to what McCartney gave to the Beatles. He also had a versatility that enabled him to play just about any instrument that came to hand and he had a flair for arranging music. His touch is especially notable in Stones albums from AFTERMATH through LET IT BLEED. But, with STICKY FINGERS, the Stones began to eschew simple acoustic songs like &quot;Lady Jane&quot; and &quot;Backstreet Girl&quot;, moving instead toward a denser, more layered sound like what you hear on &quot;Sway&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot;.<br />STICKY FINGERS is a great album, but I must confess that it has never been one of my favorites. For me, it just doesn't have the accessibility or the listenability of earlier efforts like AFTERMATH, BEGGARS BANQUET or LET IT BLEED. Warm, homey tunes like &quot;Dear Doctor&quot;, &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, &quot;Factory Girl&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot; give way here to the stark perfection of &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; and the somewhat lugubrious &quot;Sway&quot;.<br />The album begins with one of the Stones best rockers. &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; has a great guitar riff, and the dynamite rhythm guitar drives this cut from beginning to end. &quot;Sway&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; are fine songs, but with a slow tempo and &quot;heavy&quot;, layered, ponderous quality, that have kept them from being real favorites of mine. Then comes &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot;, which just cooks for about two and a half minutes before suddenly morphing into the most un-Stones-like jazz instrumental imaginable. Another verse, another chorus, and this would have been a great rock song. As it is, it's an enigma. &quot;You Gotta Move&quot; is a throwback to the band's early, R&amp;B days. &quot;Bitch&quot; is a nice rocker. &quot;I Got The Blues&quot; is another blues/R&amp;B throwback. Then there's the cold &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;. A brilliant piece, but not one you pop in to sing along with while driving down the freeway. Catchy rock-and-roll gives way to &quot;art&quot;. Jagger gives the vocal on &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; a loopy sound, as though he's making fun of himself. The album closes with &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;, another pretty tune but slow and burdened with layers of orchestration.<br />STICKY FINGERS is one of the great rock albums. A classic. Whenever I actually sit down and listen to it, I always enjoy it. And I'm always impressed by it. Usually, though, when I get it out, I just listen to &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and then put it away. Is it possible for something to be too good? I don't know, but if it is, this album would be my candidate for the honor.

6305603847|5.0|The first time I saw &quot;The Wall&quot; was about a year ago, and I was very quick to understand where this movie was coming from. Im 18, and like Pink in the movie am self absorbed, and self destructive, with a certain sense about things. Ironicly this film was released the excact day I was born. I've never before seen a movie like this and dont expect too again, because unlike many of todays films this movie has meaning without cute sarcasm, and an artistic image that had an impact on me. Through the fog of over rated, unrealistic, plotless movies, that by the way can all be easily compared to movies released just before them, this movie even today stands out. To all the people who saw this movie but didnt quite get it, watch it again and look deeper. Open your minds to it, and it will come to you. Understanding what &quot;The Wall&quot; means metaphorically, and feeling what is felt by Pink as he stares star eyed at the television will make the movie much more enjoyable to you.
B000002MJC|5.0|I started out not being impressed with this album on the first listen because it seemed such a departure from their usual sound and had much more of a \\"rock\\" sound. Don't let this deter you! The rock is seamlessly and quietly blended in so that it meshes perfectly with signature DM style (you can breathe easy, trust me). I ended up LOVING this album and cannot get it out of my head. The best songs are \\"Rush,\\" a sexually charged romp that bites your heart and burns angry tears of passion-and also, \\"One Caress\\"  which is the most beautiful sweet, delicate, sad melody that just glitters from the whole album. It is the one song that will pierce your mind and soul with deliciously haunting cellos, strings and other orchestral manoeuvres in the dark. You will notice that every song on this album starts out slow and lonely, then violently EXPLODES into melody.<br />SOFAD is sheer brilliance. The overall vibe is of melancholia (of course) only more aggressive, stabbed with guitar stylings while still being DM with its electro-synth beats and hooks which are signature of synthpop. However, if you're not familiar with DM, don't get this album right away. It's just not the proper segueway into appreciating them fully. Listen to their earlier works and then get this one---as a satisfying piece de resistance.
6304140428|3.0|My initial response to this film was total shock.  I was amazed at the method of communication between the two.  They are two miserable individuals who have become comfortable in a total failure of a marriage.  The hate each other but are afraid to be apart.  They have created a an imaginary child as a glue to somehow keep the marriage in tact ( the child being the sole reason for them to stay together).  Unfortunate for both Martha and George, she shares with Honey, their young guest, the most sacred and fantical part of their marriage - the baby.  She allowed someone else into their fantasy.  This was the beginning of the end of their illusions.  When George &quot;killed&quot;  the baby, he infact, killed what was holding their marriage together... or did he?  I felt very sad for the both of them.  They represent to me, two miserable people are afraid of life and living.
0876852630|5.0|This is the third book of Bukowski's that i have read (the first two were &quot;Post Office&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;) and thus far it is my favorite. <br />This book is composed of a series of short passages, 87 total. This book is mostly about Henry Chinaski (meaning, for the most part, Charles Bukowski) drinking, having sex with women who drink, and moving from job to job. I dont know how many jobs Chinaski has in this book, but he often holds them only long enough for a single one-page section. <br />If there is any unity in terms of story and plot in this book, it is found in the women, such as Jan and Laura, who manage to stay in Chinaski's life for a few jobs; the women serve to string together the sections. <br />More significant than any plot are the various interwoven themes that Bukowski deals with, such as futility, solitary existence, and death (all themes that might lead us to link Bukowski with existentialist philosophy). These ideas (among others) are all related, and also related to the ways in which they are expressed, namely, through alcohol, cheap sex, disgust towards humanity, and peacefulness in the strangest situations-- and of course, Henry Chinaski's inability to hold a job or even have any desire to do so. On one hand, this book is a quick and light read; on the other hand, a close read that keeps in mind the interplay between the different themes involved truly exposes the genius of Bukowski. <br />Overall, this is a book that for the most part ends where it begins (it begins with Chinaki arriving in New Orleans and &quot;looking for the poor section&quot; and ends in a go-go bar, with Chinaski holding his last 38 cents), but this circularity, i find, is intimate to the theme of futility: why go anywhere? why do anything? As Bukowski writes in the movie &quot;Barfly&quot;, &quot;Who made up this rule that everybody has to 'be somebody'?&quot; Chinaski doesn't refuse to &quot;be somebody&quot; (remember, he has a great will to write),but he refuses to do it in terms set by other people; he refuses to define himself in terms of occupation, and other surface illusions--as to be somebody in such a way, he finds, is far too confining. On a side note, it seems as if Bukowski lifted a lot of material from this book when writing the script for &quot;Barfly,&quot; as Laura becomes Wanda in the film and both the book and the film have Wilbur, among other similarities. Overall, this is a fine book that is both an enjoyable read and constantly impresses the reader with clever insights into what we often take as ordinary.
B00000J9HE|5.0|This is a 2 CD set which can be recommended to those who do not normally react well to Karajan's music making.  His interpretations are legendary, and the recordings are excellent, bearing in mind they are 35 years old.<br />The Fifth especially (recorded for the 100th anniversary of the composer's birth) is one of the recorded classics, and the recordings of the other works are hardly inferior.<br />Sibelius himself, on hearing Karajan's 1950s Philharmonia Orchestra mono recordings of his music, said 'Karajan is the only conductor who knows what I meant', and when one listens to this set, one can hear why.<br />If you want these works on CD, do not hesitate.
B00000634B|4.0|This album brims with angst and troublemaker from a less violent day.  Fist fights versus guns.  Racing cars instead of a drive by.  Hip, pop, rock, and a voice all rolled into one band.  It gets my listen every now and again, but it's got so much energy, that I get tired of it after a while.  It'd be better as a &quot;best of&quot; album if it had some slower stuff mixed in to balance it out.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This album is nothing short of smashing.  India Arie has the true voice of a Queen and the soul of our ancestors.  The entire album is filled with phenomenal lyrics, extraordinary music, and a superb, harmonious voice!  I hope this album goes at least triple platinum!  To all of you who are considering burning this CD...please do not!  Purchase it for yourself so that we can support this sister!  I hope to hear many more beautiful albums from this gorgeous Nubian Queen!<br />One!
B000000XB9|5.0|If you like Creedence, but don't know what to get to hear their music, this is an excellent starting place.  Every track is a hit that most are sure to know the words to, and can certainly hum to.  There's no song that isn't something I've heard before and loved - unlike many &quot;collection&quot; albums which feature half good songs, and half remix wanna-bes.  This is everything for the casual Creedence listener.  The cover evens gives a history of their music.  One problem would be that my copy has a &quot;low-volume&quot; problem, which means I have to turn up my stereo a notch to listen to it.  Not a bad thing with CCR!
B000002JS8|5.0|Highway to Hell is not only a classic album but it's one of the greatest of all time. This is AC/DC's last album with original singer Bon Scott before his death. The band is in top form on this album, the rhythm section of Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams is very solid, and rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young plays the perfect rhythm parts to compliment his bother Angus' amazing leads. The songs on Highway to Hell are pure heavy metal, so if you don't like metal, don't bother even looking for this cd. All of the songs stick to the same format as all of AC/DC's music has for the last 27 years, straightforward upbeat metal. This album features one of AC/DC's most well known songs, Highway to Hell. There are also many fan favorites on this album such as Girls Got Rhythm, Shot Down in Flames, Night Prowler, and my personal favorite off this album, If You Want Blood (You've Got It). The less well know songs such as Walk All Over You, Get It Hot, and Touch Too Much are also great. This is an excellent album reccommended to anyone.
B000002GBB|5.0|I think that this is one of the Greatest Styx albums out, along with The Grand Illusion. They're harmonies are wonderful, the organ in I'm OK is awesome, Renegade is just really cool, Great White Hope an excellent rocker, Pieces of Eight is moving, Blue Collar Man is powerful for the working peoples, Queen of Spades and Message/Lords of the Ring bizarre, but good none the less. You get the point. This is my most recent Styx aquisition, and I love it. The instrumentation is excellent too. It just has a lot of power in the songs and arrangements. A must for Styx fans and and non Styx fans.
B00004LN16|5.0|Stiff Upper Lip is AC/DC's best album in a long time. While all of their other albums throughout the 80's and 90's have been good Stiff Upper Lip blows them all away. AC/DC manages to start 2000 on a high note with one of the best albums of the year. Singer Brian Johnson's voice seems to have gotten more powerful since the Ballbreaker album, just when everyone was doubting him he comes back and surprises everyone. As far as the band what else can be said, they've been making the same style of music for almost 30 years and they still sound great. This is Phil Rudd's second album back with the band, and he and bassist Cliff Williams prove that they are one of the greatest rhythm sections of all time, and of course you can't forget rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, he is one of the most underrated rhythm players ever. Then of course there's lead guitarist Angus Young, what else can be said about him, besides the fact that he's one of the greatest guitarists of our time, with his simple blues based riffs and solos he's gained respect from many other musicians for playing under his ability. It is also the reason why he's also very underrated, as the whole band is. Stiff Upper Lip was produced by George Young, brother of Angus and Malcolm, who produced their early albums. You can expect from this album what you'd expect from any other AC/DC album. It's very much blues rock, so if you didn't like them before the odds are that this album won't do it for you. There are many upbeat rockers on this album such as the title track, Safe in New York City, Can't Stop Rock and Roll, Satellite Blues, Damned, Give It Up and All Screwed Up. There are also some laid back songs that are very bluesy such as Meltdown, House of Jazz, Can't Stand Still, and Come And Get It. Stiff Upper Lip is a great album, the best AC/DC has put out in years, but like I said before if you don't already like AC/DC this album probably won't change your mind, but if you do like them definately get this one.
B00005AQAW|5.0|This album is laid back but also has the side if you want to jump around all feeders songs are catchy and they will always stay in your mind a great album id say you will burn out the stereo when you play its so rocky
B000002MT0|3.0|Come is without a doubt Prince's darkest album to date, it is also an amazing piece of work. The songs are for the most part very jazzy, it is also the last album sold as Prince until he recently changed his name back. The first song on the album is the title track it is pretty long but is avery good song. Space is also a great upbeat techno jazz song, this is a very hard album to describe. Pheromone is probably my least favorite song on the album, just something about it doesn't work. The next song Loose is the best song on the album, it is pure dance. He sounds great and there is an excellent guitar solo in it. Papa is a very melodic song while Race is an almost hip hop jazz tune. Dark is another one of the best songs on the album, it is a funk ballad type song. Solo is another song on the album that I really don't like, the only good part about it is that it displays his singing voice. The last real song on the album is Letitgo, this is also a great song. It sounds like a dark funk/r&amp;b song. The album closer is called Orgasm, I don't think it calls for an explanation. If you are a fan of jazz or an open minded music fan check this album out.
B00005B6C9|5.0|&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is an excellent example of the Bee Gee's legendary ability to produce great albums year after year. There's something for everybody on this CD!  The silky-smooth Bee Gees' sound combined with incredibly modernistic musical accompaniment makes this album a must have!  The title track is bold and grabs you from the onset.  Don't miss this one!
B000000OAA|5.0|This right here is classic Queen, Sheer Heart Attack is without a doubt their best album of all time, not one bad song, not one note out of place. Freddie Mercury's amazing, Brian May's guitar playing is fantastic, and the rhythm section of John Decon and Roger Taylor is great.  The masterpiece opens with a masterpiece, Brighton Rock. In my opinion that's one of their best songs ever, everything about it is perfect, especially the guitar solo. One of their signature songs Killer Queen is next, I'm sure you've heard this song before. Tenement Funster is a great song sung by drummer Roger Taylor. Flick of the Wrist is a piano based song with great guitar, great background vocals, and Freddie's vocals are excellent. Lily of the Valley is a short ballad, it's actually really good too. Now I'm Here is another one of Queen's rockin signature songs, so there's nothing really to be said about this song besides the point that it's great. In the Lap of the Gods is another amazing song displaying the talents of the band. It also shows their ability to write extremely beautiful pieces of music and it shows how great Freddie Mercury's voice really was. Stone Cold Crazy is pure metal, it is heavy fast and the band sounds great. Brian May's solo is something to be remembered. Dear Friends is a delicate minute long ballad, featuring Freddie on piano and the band supplying background vocals. Misfire is John Decon's song in the sense that he played almost all of the guitars on it, it shows how talented and underrated he wa as a musician. Bring Back that Leroy Brown is a 40's style swing song, showing Queen's versitility as a band. She Makes Me is an upbeat acoustic song, it's actually very good. In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited is another excellent song. Then on the remastered version there is a remix of Stone Cold Crazy but it sounds the same as the original so it's nothing special. Sheer Heart Attack is a classic album that everyone must own.
B000002UAR|5.0|Around the same time the Byrd's released their 1st psychedelic album, &quot;Fifth Dimension,&quot; the Beatles released theirs, &quot;Revolver,&quot; certainly one of their best. This is filled will great songs, without any fillers, just depending on your musical tastes (but that goes for any album with a group as varied as the Beatles). An amazing achievement, especially in production.... this has some of the greatest experimental sounds to come out of any style of music. 'Taxman' is a Harrison song that is certainly an entertaining song as well as being very witty. Paul, of course, has some great tunes like 'Eleanor Rigby' which is simply beatiful and disregarding what some may say, 'Good Day Sunshine' is catchy and a great song. Ringo does a nice vocal on 'Yellow Submarine' as for some amazing drumming throughout the entire record. Every song Lennon does on this record completely knocks me out, 'She Said She Said,' is a favorite of mine, inspired by Peter Fonda during an ... ... at Lennon's house, where George was freaking out and saying that he was scared, and Fonda relaxed him and said that it's OK, and went on explaining about how he accidently shot himself (he never tryed to commit suicide, contrary to popular belief) and said that he died like four times on the operating table, and told George something like &quot;...I know what it's like to be dead...&quot; and Lennon came over and said, &quot;...who put all that in your head? God man, your making me feel like I've never been born!...&quot; and that's the story of the song. And John had all great songs on this album like 'I'm Only Sleeping,' and his main contribution, 'Tommorow Never Knows' which some like and some hate (I love it, John appeals to me the most), but it is the perfect end to Revolver, a psychedelic masterpiece, in every sense of the word.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I watched this movie because I've read on various music newsgroups that the soundtrack has various pop artists (Sheryl Crow, Tom Waits, Justin Timberlake of N'Sync, to name a few) doing covers of Def Leopard's classic tune &quot;Armageddon It&quot;   THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE!   .....but i sat through the movie regardless, hoping that these musical interpretations would appear, perhaps as a climax.  I was just about to abandon my hope, as Bruce Willis' character fashions a makeshift time-machine  (Back to the Future eat your heart out!) to return to a time when the Armageddon could be stopped......... my heart raced!  He's going to go back to the 80s, and THEN we'll hear Def Leppard!  Not so.  The time machine only brought him.... well, i won't ruin it for you. I'll just say there's no Def Leppard... and that Bruce Willis' subtle nod to another famous Bruce in the climactic closing battle (let's just say it's a vicious spinning side-kick) was a brilliant and emotional tribute.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I think few will argue that The Bee Gees are the most underated group in the industry, with that said....I am a big Bee Gees fan in my 20's and I have bought every album since ESP, plus some of there oldies.  I am happy to say that this is their best album, overall, that I have ever listened to.  If you are a fan, buy this album!!!
B000056K04|4.0|Darn-good album..nearly every track is a keeper. &quot;So Right&quot; is tremendous and will have the melody sticking in your head for extended periods of time after listening.  So, this album is a &quot;departure&quot; from other DMB releases--change is GOOD, folks!!! Those of you not embracing the change need to live somewhere like where I do (Boise, ID.), where vanilla crap tunes are all you get.  BUY IT!!
B0000019PA|5.0|So you like that indie rock do ya? well then you can't get anymore indie that this. This album is a great example that the media sucks and that underground music is better than ever before. Get this just so that you can feel educated about todays best music.
B00005AFVR|4.0|Having caught Bruce &amp; the E Street Band on their reunion tour, this live CD captures the excitement and sheer artistry of this veteran, seasoned unit.  As a lifelong fan, one who has been a fan since '73, I have to say that after all this time, Bruce and the guys are tighter than ever.  The sound quality on the CD is superb; the mix between Bruce's singing and the band's musicianship is nothing short of excellent. Max's drumming is superhuman; the 3 guitar attack of Bruce, Steve &amp; Nils never misses it's mark.  And how about Steve himself?  That was a great move, bringing him back in the fold. The performance: how can you argue?  If you caught the HBO concert special, you can just begin to realize just how damn good these guys are in concert.  There is nobody better; not today, not back in 1978 when they were arguably at their all-time peak.  Sound quality is probably the best of any of Bruce's live efforts to date.  This collection does the &quot;Live '75-'85&quot; collection one better; as for the &quot;MTV Plugged&quot;....let's not go there, OK? Those of us who are true fans know that the '92-'93 Tour (also known as the Lost in the Desert years) was a joke, save for the performance of &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; from that disc.  Otherwise, that one just plain sucked.  Just listen to the E Street Band's take on the new CD of &quot;Atlantic City&quot; and you realize 2 things: first, the MTV Plugged version is weak, and second this song should have been electrified all along.<br />So why do I give only 4 stars instead of 5? Because Bruce could have done this one even better had he not dropped in &quot;Born to Run&quot; at the last minute.  Did he really need to put this song out live for a third time? NO.  I also question his putting out for the second time a live version of &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;  Yes it was a show-stopper, but 16 minutes worth is time wasted.  He could have used the opportunity to put out a live version of &quot;The Promise&quot; or &quot;The E Street Shuffle&quot; from the 2 NYC shows.  &quot;The Ties that Bind&quot; or something from another night on the stand would have worked also: &quot;Trapped&quot; &quot;Factory&quot;  &quot;Back in your Arms&quot;; the possibilities could have been endless.  So to that end, I'm a little.....and I emphasize A LITTLE...disappointed.  But, all in all, this is a killer collection.  The performances of &quot;Atlantic City&quot; &quot;Mansion...&quot; &quot;Youngstown&quot; &quot;Murder Inc&quot; and &quot;Badlands&quot; are as riveting as you'll ever hear on CD.  Disc 2 highlights are a dead-on &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot; (finally!) and a superb acoustic version of &quot;BITUSA&quot;.<br />Bruce played it smart here in the sense that he gave his public 2 new songs, the excellent &quot;American Skin&quot; and the uplifting &quot;Land of Hope &amp; Dreams&quot;.  These guys have alot of steam left in them.  This disc proves it.  I just wish he'd listen to what the fans want more.  A couple of different tunes, and this would be 5 star all the way.<br />A minor flaw on an otherwise excellent collection.  The E street Band is back!  Give it a listen and hear what real rock'n'roll is about.
B00005B6C9|4.0|I must admit I was surprised when I noticed this album was very different from their last (brilliant &quot;Still Waters&quot;), but who's complaining?  TIWICI has a more retrospetive feel, blending clasic Bee Gee musical stylings from the last 4 decades.  A very brave effort indeed..the brothers Gibb have produced somewhat of a &quot;melting&quot; of their past and present (hopefully NOT a swansong)  Highlights include &quot;Wedding Day&quot;-a sugary pop balled sung by Robin and Barry, &quot;Deja Vu&quot; -very catchy and uplifting sung by Robin, &quot;Embrace&quot;-a more contemporary song, and &quot;Technicolar Dreams&quot; - a very 60's and kinda psychadelic feel :-).  I feel that &quot;still Waters&quot; remains the Bees Gees best, but TIWICI is a lot of fun!  Keep them comming Barry, Robin, and Maurice..we love you!!!
0399134204|5.0|I love this book. I can't wait to finish reading all of Amy Tan's stuff. This book is so incredible! The characters are so real. I enjoyed Lindo Jong the best! I had to look up and see if any of this stuff was biographical...I found out some of it was based on her life loosely. The book did a great job of showing the relationships between mothers and daughters. It's not just a book about chinees women and thier relationships; it's about every women alive.
B000059ZLH|4.0|When you think of Dream Theater, the first thing you imagine is four masters of their instruments and a &quot;patented&quot; voice box. Dream Theater does hold up to all that I'd imagined from them on this DVD. Right from the opening scene through to &quot;Finally Free&quot; it's a well orchestrated performance with all round brilliance from the guys. John Petrucci is awesome as usual, but to be a bit critical, he does lose it for a while in the &quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot; solo. But to be fair, it just proves everyone's human. Jordan and Mike are mind blowing and so too John Myung and James.I loved this performance. More than &quot;scenes...&quot;, it is the bonus live material that makes this DVD a great buy. I'd recommend it to all rock, metal and prog-rock/jazz fans. <br />On to the presentation. I think they could have done with a little less of the video presentations. While watching the DVD it takes your mind off the music, and thats what I bought the DVD for...the musicianship. This is the reason for my 4 star rating instead of 5, apart from certain technical stuff on the DVD thats real sloppy as pointed out by quite a few people already. All credit to DT for their amazing musicianship and for keeping the flag of rock/metal flying high. Keep rocking!!!
B000001F26|4.0|Starting with Layla, this collection pretty much puts all of Clapton's most worthwhile tracks of music from the past several decades on one cd.  These are the more recent classics and this is a very good album.  I especially liked Wonderful Tonight, which is a very beautiful song.<br />However, with the exception of Layla, none of these songs feature any particularly clever or extraordinary guitar playing.  VH-1 recently did a survey of music critics and musicians to list the 100 greatest rock guitarists of all time and Clapton was listed as No. 1, ahead of Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana??!!  If that survey was conducted in 1975, I would not object to Clapton being placed in the top five, but in the year 2000, come on!  Name some artist who Clapton has significantly influenced - I can't think of a single one.  He simply has not shown any remarkable guitar skills in the past quarter century on any of his albums. If you have heard of Clapton's prowess as a guitarist and are seeking audio proof of his skills, you won't find much of it here.  These are by and large, songs that were hits on the radio.  If you want to hear examples of Clapton's work when he truly was a great guitarist, buy Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton, when he was the lead guitarist with legendary Brit bluesman John Mayall.  Additionally, buy all of Cream's albums.  <br />To summarize, a strong album displaying Clapton's talent at writing popular songs that received much radio airtime.  This is not the cd for music fans looking for examples of the man's [former] brilliance on the guitar.
B00000JFC5|5.0|I bought the cd after only hearing just a few songs and I absolutely loved them. Since then I've shared the cd with my friends and family who love Moby now too. I have been meaning to buy more of his music, but I listen to this so much, I don't bother. This is one of my favorite cds of all time! I love Moby!
B000051VWW|3.0|I have been a Sade fan since her first album came out, have all of her other cd's and have listened to several of them probably two hundred times a piece.  After her long hiatus, I expected Sade to have stored up some really special melodies for this cd.  Well, it appears that she spent her long period away from the musical spotlight focusing more on her family than on being a songwriter.  I can't criticize that at all in a general sense, but the result is that this cd is a couple notches below that of her other albums.<br />Per the VH-1 Sade special, I now understand that &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; is actually a bit of a double entendre, as it is a style of slower, more sensual music that has African and Caribbean influences and is a distant, more refined cousin of reggae.  I have never heard of this style of music before (although I have been heavily intersted in music of all sorts for the past two decades)and I doubt that this cd will promote that style to any further popularity.<br />In her prior works, Sade's incredible voice just entrances the listener, but the rythm of her songs is equally effective, reaching out with an invisible, velvet-covered gauntlet to impart a gentle sway in the listener's shoulders.  No portion of this album has that effect.  As others have stated, this cd has a slower, much less upbeat sound than her prior works, and less originality; many of the songs sound so similar that if a one were to have this playing in the background while focused on some task, one might not even notice the transitions between songs.  <br />If another artist sang these same songs, it would probably deserve a 1 star rating.  Sade still has the smoothest, most sensual voice of any current singer.  However, her voice is just not enough to carry her beyond mediocrity on this cd.  There seems to be a recent trend of artists focusing (sometimes quite arrogantly) so much on their voices that they disregard having memorable tunes or instrumental accompanyment to theirsongs (e.g. Sarah McLaughlin, Sting)and it seems that Sade has taken a few steps down this road.  There is also a recent trend for groups to market lousy material that pales in comparison to their earlier works and a further trend for many longtime fans of the group to lap it up out of thoughtless devotion to their idols, without spending a second of time attempting to make an intelligent, discriminating evaluation of the new music's quality (e.g. groups ranging from U2 to Jimmy Buffet to Sarah McLaughlin).  These trends are unfortunate, and it seems that Sade and the 5 star-reviewing fans of this album have acquiesced to them.<br />This cd is very comparable to U-2's All That You Can't Leave Behind, but without the single great song &quot;Beautiful Day.&quot;  If you loved that album and are a Sade fan, you will likely love this album also.  If you have a bit more discriminating taste and found U-2's latest cd to be bland, you will likely find this cd to be bland and would rate it at the bottom of the list for Sade's music.
0399146253|5.0|I was surprised to read so many negative reviews about this book.  For the type of novel it is, I thought it was great.  I have read most (if not all) of the Scarpetta series, and I thought this was a terrific chapter in her on-going saga - there were even a few words I had to look up!  <br />Admittedly, I grew tired of the banter with Marino and felt more could have been resolved with him, but I *enjoyed* seeing more into Scarpetta's psyche, and finding that even our strong, capable heroine has a few soft spots.  After all, anyone who can cook gourmet Italian meals in her spare time after 12 hour workdays, while drinking like a fish, not exercising and still maintaining a terrific figure, deserves to have a minor break-down or two!    <br />As for the sequel issue, well, aren't they *all* sequels??  It's difficult to read them out of order, since the men in her life have changed over the years.  Also, previous cases are mentioned in later books all the time.  Yes, it is a bit tiresome to re-read what you already know from a previous book, but it can also be nice to get a refresher on what's hapenned to date.  <br />In short, I could only find the hard-covered edition, and I'm not sorry I bought it!
0671004107|5.0|I recommend Contact by Carl Sagan as a summer reading book for anyone who is looking for an exciting and intellectually stimulating book.  The main character, Ellie Arroway, discovers a signal from aliens.  After decrypting the message, she and other scientists find that it gives instructions on how to make a spacecraft.  The book gives a views of different groups in the world and how they react to the message and building the spacecraft.  The way that Sagan writes the book gives the reader the impression that the book is actually about the human race.     Carl Sagan's writing is well done and makes the book exciting.  He challenges the reader to think and to look at the world from a totally different perspective.  He incorporates various intellectual studies, especially philosophy, to give his book power and to make his themes apparent.  Because it is well written and incorporated a lot of ideas, this book left me speechless and wanting more.
0385501005|5.0|Yes, here it is, another book about a single Londoner, unlucky in love and with jobs.. but this time around, our heroine is actually a hero - wow. And I must admit, that while I enjoy the Bridge Jones books and their clones, this was a welcome break from that formula and opened up a whole new world by showing things from the male perspective.<br />Instead of the perfect boyfriend, this time around there's a perfect girlfriend our hero has mucked things up with - and the central theme ... can Duffy commit or not? Despite the very typical premise of a commitment-phobe male, Mr. Commitment is not a typical book - it's extremely well-written, humorous, enjoyable and quite believable. As Duffy reaches his decision, you realize that you've pretty much watched him get there, seen why he did it, watched him bond the way guys do and everything falls into place without being contrived or too shmarmy (of course there is some shmarm, as it's also basically a romance). And it didn't feel as though someone had taken the same old plot and simply switched genders - throughout it felt as though things were being told from a male perspective.<br />I definitely enjoyed this book both more than I expected and more than I've liked others in a similar vein. There are great characters, a good story, humor, drama (of the funny sort) and a whole new lens through which to view things. I think this book has a lot to offer to anyone, whether or not you like the genre. I came away very impressed and surprised by how much I liked it and how highly I recommend it.
0553106635|4.0|This review goes for all the song of ice and fire books. <br />The world G.R.R.M. has created is not unique but good enough to feel alive.  The 4 stars are mainly because of the character drawing. It´s still rare to find an author of fantasy that can create people who are complex, interesting and have a real feeling to them. It´s even rarer to find someone who actually makes the players of his fantasy drama not all good or all bad. They are just people, and you may not like all of them but why they do what they do becomes understandable. <br />What worries me is that the story seems to be long in the telling and G.R.R.M may lose, not the hold of the readers (cause everyone wants to know how a story is going to end) but rather the total fascination that´s still got it´s hold on me. That´s what happened to the &quot;wheel of time&quot;-series by Robert Jordan. I will read them all but my pleasure is not what it was and I also got an irritating thought that says &quot;get to the point&quot;.<br />Please G.R.R.M. don´t let it happen with the song of ice and fire-series.
0792833201|5.0|POLTERGEIST: (noun)-meaning noisy ghosts. See movie for details.<br />I saw this movie for the first time back when it was released in 1982. I was twelve years old at the time, and found it genuinely frightening.  Now that I'm older and have seen it many times, it doesn't scare me so much anymore, but it still delivers.  A collaboration between Steven Spielberg (of such films as....well you know!) and Tobe Hooper (director of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre). POLTERGEIST is the only ghost story that I have ever seen that delivers chills, state-of-the-art special effects, and unforgettable (and very believable) performances by the entire cast, yet remains in a class all its own simply because it laces these elements with both humor and warmth.<br />After living in their brand new house for the last five years, the very close Freeling family starts to notice strange happenings every now and then. Particularly observant is 5-year old Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke as an absolute doll).  At first the ghostly pranks are a little exciting to the family, but soon they realize the ghosts are not simply just playing around, but mean real business.  The POLTERGEIST swings into full force, making it's intentions clear, pulling the family into a living nightmare from which they may not escape.<br />This DVD edition doesn't really offer many extras, but the picture is the best that I've ever seen (the televised versions that we saw for years were very grainy, even blurred).  An interesting observation that I made was that the theatrical trailer actually shows some extended sequences/dialogue that are not in the film (?).  Maybe we'll be treated to a special edition somewhere down the line.  Followed in 1986 by the sequel POLTERGEIST II: The Other Side, which would've been slightly better had Hooper or Speilberg been involved.
B0000048YO|4.0|For years I've wondered about this film, ever since the glimpse to it in &quot;the Shawshank redemption&quot; -&quot;Me ? sure I'm decent...&quot;,and &quot;So this is Jonny Ferl, I've heard a lot about you, Jonny Ferl...&quot;<br />Finally I got the chance to watch the entire movie, which was quite an experience ! Rita was great, without her the movie wouldn't stand out. Her performance was superb, shadowing the rest of the crew, that ,frankly, wasn't that great.I understand now all the fuss about her in the &quot;Shawshank&quot; movie, she deseved it. She is the movie, put any other actor beside her and the movie would still be great, omit her and it's just anither movie. She was really amazing ,talented actress.<br />I recommend this movie. Like most of the oldies it's a bit naive, nonetheless -worth seeing.
B000002J2F|5.0|&quot;Duke&quot; is one of the best recordings ive ever heard. From the overture of &quot;Behind the lines&quot; you feel up-lifted by the thrilling emotion of the fantastic instrumental intro and the rest of this magnific opener. &quot;Duchess&quot; is fantastic with his drum machine-loop atmosphere and its linked with the incredibly brief and heart-breaking &quot;Guide vocal&quot;. &quot;Man of our times&quot; is simply the best song of M. Rutherford for Genesis. I tell you, theres no weak song on this CD. &quot;Heathaze&quot; is almost painfully haunting and beautiful and, of course is written by Mr. Banks.Specially i love &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot;, wich has many armonic modulations and breathtaking intro &amp; finale. The most pop-oriented tracks and the ballads are all examples of good taste and musicianship. The final suite &quot;Dukes travels&quot; &amp; &quot;Dukes travels&quot; are the most thrilling 10 minutes of my life EVERYTIME I HEAR IT!!!. In thgis instrumentals you have at full dispaly all the wonderful magic of Genesis. Its unbeliavable and indescriptible the feeling that leaves you shaking and taking your breath again after the last chord. A must-own by any fan of any era of Genesis, this stuff never gets old, and i only hope i could hear music like this today...If i could give 6 stars...
6302293553|5.0|For being a low budget film, this one is really good.  The classic Monty Python actors come together the funniest rendition of King Arthur and his K-nig-hits.  It was filled with comedy, a funny story, weird twists, french men, and a killer rabbit.  The only thing that I didn't understand (well not too well anyway) was the ending.  Other than that, It was excellent and well worth your time.
6300214435|1.0|Ever read Dante's Inferno? Well, this is what this movie reminds me of. A dark, red-hued hell with all sorts of devilish characters. Like Leonard Maltin said, it'll give you a headache. The storyline is DIRT compared to RAIDERS. The acting isn't so great, either. And really, who cares about three stupid rocks in the middle east? I don't know if there even is such a thing as three sacred rocks in middle eastern culture, but it would be nice if Indiana went after an artifact that's a little better known to us. Which is why I think the series went with the Holy Grail theme in the last movie, LAST CRUSADE. All in all, this is a very dark, depressing movie, with few parts that are really worth your time, or your money.
B00000IAU3|5.0|With beautifully written music and lyrics, Dido shows nothing but pure talent. Having been compared to the likes of Sarah McLachlan and Sinead O' Connor, Dido's own unique style shines through brightly in her debut album, &quot;No Angel&quot;. <br />I first heard Dido's &quot;Here With Me&quot; in Melbourne last year, when I watched &quot;Roswell&quot; on tv one night. The mysterious and melancholic tune greatly caught my attention...such a fantastic track! I wanted to know who the singer was but thought it would be just another one-off artist. I later saw the video to &quot;Here With Me&quot; through cable music channel and it just took off from there. <br />Dido's current hit, &quot;Thank You&quot; can be very infectious as you'll find yourself humming to it at every opportunity. I think many would agree. Many would also say that their first introduction to this track was through Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot; and although &quot;Thank You&quot; has been featured in two motion picture soundtracks, &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; and more recently, &quot;Bounce&quot;, it really only received massive airplay after her collaboration with Eminem. <br />I must say &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;All You Want&quot; are other great tracks that should be released as Dido's next singles. It has good tempo, and I love how Dido's songs are different in a way where a suspicious intro is accompanied by intelligent mixes of background music and a surprising chorus that diverges from the first few lines, yet preserving the melody of the song. <br />The one over minute intro to &quot;Honestly OK&quot; kept me curious and eagerly waiting for the singing to begin. I really liked the slow, soothing feel to it while the sorrowful first few lines in &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot; really set the mood for me as I was reading Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;. It came across like a sad, traditional Irish poetic tune at the beginning, &quot;...returns no more, I will not watchthe ocean. My lover's gone. No earthly ships will ever bring him home again. Bring him home again&quot;, but the beat caught up around the second verse, so it didn't turn out as a depressing track, but more of a moving love song. <br />All the tracks on &quot;No Angel&quot; share a distinct touch - Dido's style, which might be a bore to some but her beautiful haunting voice most certainly makes for easy listening, especially if you're a fan of the Lilith Fair.
0800177177|4.0|Keanu Reeve's excrable performance amid an otherwise excellent cast threatens to take the whole film down with it. Only Copolla's rock-steady vision, combined with Oldman's astonishing performance as the man/beast Dracula preserve the glory of this enduring myth. Part tribute, part remake, Copolla eschews modern special effects and deliberately uses only effects possible in Todd Browning's day. A clever prologue and epilogue leave the original novel fairly intact while adding immensely to the story's meaning and depth.  Embued with this extra dimension, Drac rises from the level of mere spooky monster to that of classic tragic figure.  Coppola also manages to flesh out Stoker's wooden victorians with some entertaining human touches.  Why not five whole stars?  Reeve's performance will make you squirm; you actually feel embarrassed for him.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Whilst Australian music is usually my forte, here is such an album on which I feel compelled to comment about: its return to the basics.  2001 has seen many forms of music being not cluttered but pared down to its simplest form.  Dido's savvy folk sets an example.  The strains of &quot;Here With Me&quot; and &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot; demonstrate that which is the core of popular music - catching and storytelling.  Dido obviously has explored this thus giving her licence to adapt it to both a contempory and 'old-school' audience.  Welcome to the world Dido; and from someone in between those two categories, 'Thank You'.
B00004XMV6|5.0|Ok, I know that's a silly question. If you didn't catch the tongue-in-cheek, here it is, spelled out for you. Sure, it's erotic. Sure, it's exciting. What most people miss is the intense imagery. As an artist, some of my tastes are a little too eclectic for some folks, but this has been one of my favorite movies for years and years. Few people catch the &quot;fish&quot; metaphors. In the beginning, she's buying sushi in Chinatown. When she starts to doubt the relationship, she visits Farnworth, surveying his dead fish, telling her &quot;It's the moment the thing is so familiar...&quot; and toward the end she gets ill at the party...on the fish. There are so many more subtle, masterful, intense images. You just gotta look past the sex.
B000059XUI|4.0|&quot;Superman II&quot; is not the best film compared to the first one, but still worth watching. Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, and Margot Kidder did a pretty okay job in this one, but not as good as their performances in the first Superman film, which also starred Marlon Brando. You see Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor character in league with the three outcasts from Krypton to find a way to destroy Superman. But you also see a little bit of a repeat from the first film, where Lois Lane is still falling for Superman. But still, this is one of the best sequels around, with action and romance, etc.
B0000009SI|5.0|This is classic Zappa. I can't believe so many people haven't heard of Zappa. It's downright sickening. I think it is because you have to give Frank's albums some time to grow on you, and that's why he never achieved enormous commercial success. In this modern age of instant hook within the first five seconds, people get bored way too easily. But trust me. If you don't like the album the first time, go back and listen again. If you don't like it that time, listen again. With any Zappa album, use the rule of four. Only after listening to the album at least four times can one determine whether or not he likes the album. I have grown to appreciate Apostrophe as a rock masterpiece.  &quot;...Yellow Snow&quot; is catchy and downright hilarious, &quot;Nanook Rubs It&quot; displays Zappa's amazing guitarwork, &quot;St. Alfonzo&quot; is pure insanity, &quot;Father O'Blivion&quot; is the end to the concept that dominates the first half of the album. Then there's &quot;Cosmik Debris,&quot; a satire on the hippie era which was coming to an end. The last track is good enough, but the highlight for me is the instrumental, &quot;Apostrophe.&quot; The guitarwork can get tedious to listen to, but STICK WITH IT, when it's over you'll realize you've listened to a musical genius. Then there's always the superb piano intro on &quot;Uncle Remus.&quot; If you don't own this album you are MISSING OUT.

0684859106|3.0|Before embarking on my own review of this book I read through the others, and I must agree with several of the not too pleased reviews. This book is filled with wonderful goodies to make, however, I did note a few typos in the book. The authors or the publishers fault? Who's to say, but this book is definately not a Baking 101 book. <br />If you know your way around the kitchen and a cookbook, you can get through it okay. I have made several of the recipes (I have  baking experience) and I must say, they can be hit or miss. I must also must agree with one reviewer: the oatmeal cookies were awful. But, several others (including the chocolate cake, cheesecakes, and magic cookie bars) were wonderful! <br />Yes, if these authors write another cookbook I will check it out. Hope this review helped.
B000059ZLH|5.0|For lovers of Dream Theater and Progressive Music in general this is a must.  It is flawless and is a great value with 3 hours of material contained on the disc.
0618001905|5.0|This book should be required reading for world history education.  Adam Hochschild has performed a service to humanity by presenting the gruesome facts about the extermination of a people through greed, corruption and ritual murder in such a way as to present a fair report championing the rights of the oppressed, while explaining the motivations of the oppressors within the beliefs of the times.   This book was impossible not to finish, mainly because to deny the enormity of the slaughter and the secrets exposed felt like a personal rejection of the innocents.  Months later I'm still thinking about it.  What is so soulshattering is that the Congo again, starting in 1959, has experienced yet another unbelievable decimation of its population through (admittedly well-intentioned) polio vaccination and misguided food sources resulting in the crossover of SIV to AIDS.  Who is writing their story today?
B000056N8X|3.0|The first thing I noticed when I picked up this 2 disc set was the phrase &quot;From the Producers of the original Highlander&quot; emblazened across the top of the case.  This is intentionally misleading, since the producers of the original film are also the people who produced all of the wretched sequels since, Bill Panzer and Peter Davis.  If there's one thing they've shown us throughout their association with the Highlander &quot;franchise&quot;, it's that they'll stoop to new lows to milk their cash cow, with no regard to continuity whatsoever.  Supporters take the stance that, for their to be any sequels, the end of the original film must be ignored.  This isn't so: a character who's 450 years old has plenty of history to explore, and there could've been any number of stories to tell in that time frame.  As for the character of Duncan, and the television series, all they really had to do was set the show sometime before 1985, when the first film took place.  Sure, it would've been a little more expensive, but it would've been worth it, and would've shown more respect to the source material.<br />Now that that's said, I must say that despite all of this, I found Highlander to be better than expected.  I expected it to be awful, and was pleasantly surprised.  That's not to say it didn't have problems, but buried between them were some sparks of genius.  I particularly found the sub-plot involving Duncan and Kate to be interesting, and original.  Unfortunately, I thought the villian was too overplayed and over-the-top, the characterization of Connor off-the-mark, and the disregard for the rules of &quot;the game&quot; disappointing (if even the vile Kurgan would pay heed to the rules, wouldn't the others?  Sure, it may sound a little unrealistic, but...)<br />The second disc, with a rough cut of the film, is an exercise in bad editing.  Everything I enjoyed about the DVD cut is missing from this version (though there were 2 things in the rough cut that I thoughtshould have made it to the final).  Also, I thought the music in the final cut was great, but there was some even more exceptional music in the rough cut -- too bad they don't tell you who wrote it!<br />One other thing I forgot to mention: this film accomplishes a feat thought impossible: not only does it contradict the original film, but ALL OF THE SEQUELS and THE TELEVISION SHOW ITSELF.  But if you ignore all of that, it's really not all that bad.
078401115X|5.0|this is a must see..not for the faint hearted..(X-rated artfilm style movie)...........i was hesitant to see it because it takes place in louisiana (i dont like that culture,-accents,-music ect.) but it was all great...the voodoo was beautifully artfully done (as was the whole film)....deniro is great as always....&amp; SO was Rourke (who i didn't care for as an actor before seeing this)...if you can take graphic imagry &amp; like art films with symbolism this is a must see.... classic in many ways... cinematography is great as is everything else....but like i said before don't watch it unless you are in the habit of watching graphic (even X-rated) films...
B0000027RL|4.0|Beatles or the Rolling Stones? <br /> Pearl Jam or Nirvana <br /> <br /> That is the kind of relationship these two bands share.  You either like one or the other. There is no liking both equally.  I, personally, like Nirvana better than Pearl Jam for the following reasons: <br /> 1. Nirvana was mainstream first. <br /> 2. Nirvana had better lyrics.. <br /> Pearl Jam's music is not for everybody.  It is disturbing in it's own ways (listen to the lyrics of Jeremy OR watch the music video if you are lucky enough to catch it on MTV, the station that spoon feeds teens the music to listen to.)  I did not like this album when i first heard it, so if you don't like it, you are not alone.  But the influence on this album is extreme just like nirvana's whole career.  Look at the musicians who try and imitate Eddie Vedder's voice (Creed).  This album is also still listened to by MANY people today, and how many albums from the 90's can you say that about?  Let's face it, besides Nirvana and Pearl Jam, there were only a handful of good artists to come out of the 90's era.  Anyway, this album is not the best you can find, but it does rank higher than the MTV music out now (can you tell i don't like MTV?).  I would recommend Nevermind before this, because I think it is a better rounded album.  Get this album used if you can.

B000059ZLH|5.0|There is little that needs to be written about Dream Theater's musical abilities; suffice it to say that this is probably their best live performance ever.  The camera work is fantastic - thank God Mike Portnoy directed, because he knows exactly who to show at what time.  When Jordan is doing some incredible keyboard work the camera is on him; when Petrucci is doing his usual insane soloing, he gets the spotlight...and there's some awesome usage of split screen views for when everyone is in the midst of a wild instrumental.  <br />Everyone has a fantastic show, and you can see how much they put into their playing...by the end of the second set, Portnoy is hitting himself on the head between riffs just to not pass out.  These guys are the finest musicians in rock/metal, hands down, and this DVD shows that they have a perfect balance of virtuosity and performing with emotion.  Particularly noteworthy is their performance of The Spirit Carries On, with full gospel choir and duet singing between Jamies LaBrie and Theresa Thompson.  Indescribably powerful and moving...during the audio commentary (which is also excellent - entertaining and interesting enough to re-watch the whole concert with it turned on) the band members agree that it was the pinnacle of their musical careers.<br />Some people have complained about the audio quality because it's not in 5.1 surround.  I enjoy surround sound as much as any audiophile, but I have no problem with a 2.0 stereo soundtrack if the audio is crisp.  The DVD sounds great on my system, and the mix is very good, so there's no reason to cut any stars because of it.  <br />The video quality is worthy of DVD.  I'm personally glad it's in 4:3 pan and scan.  Guess what, 99% of the viewing public doesn't have a wide screen TV and won't for the next few years.  I'd much rather have a full screen display, and I think most people with normal sized televisions will appreciate it too.<br />I also happened to like the video clips depicting thestory behind the concept album.  For the most part were only played full screen during transitions between songs, rarely did they cover up any important musical sections so they weren't intrusive.  The video work on these scenes isn't Hollywood professional, but actually has a gritty feel that fit really well in my opinion.<br />There's also a Ton of bonus footage on this DVD. I'm not giving anything away, but there are many secrets to be found, and well over three and a half hours of footage are captured.  <br />Thanks to Mike and the rest of Dream Theater for this fantastic DVD.  A band with their talent deserves to be captured for all to see.

B00004U8H4|5.0|I have managed to see this movie twice now.  At no point could I find the black humor that some people seem to see in it.  Rather, I would call this true horror.  Just the idea that people are self-centered to the point of being able to mistake one person for another is mind blowing.  <br />Some people have stated that the chainsaw scene is one of the best parts of the movie.  I disagree.  To me the real point of the movie is driven home when he returns to Paul Allens apartment to find it completely cleaned up.  The shock comes when the rental lady simply asks him to leave and not come back.  If this single scene isn't the greatest depiction of horror even played, I don't know what is.<br />To sum up, if you're into thinking movies buy it.  If not, go somewhere else.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I started listing to Dream Theater in 1992. I have yet to find a band that can compare in the caliber of genius that DT demonstrates. This DVD was beautifully done in every aspect. I was excited to see a live version of Change of Seasons in its entirety. The progression of DT and their music is one of the best attributes of the band. I can't wait until their next album. Until then see you Ytsejammers......
1573226521|5.0|This exciting novel by Alex Garland is a must read even if you do not like to read. THE BEACH is a book that as soon as you start reading it you will not want to put it down. The book has just enough action to make the reader want to continue.       THE BEACH is about a man named Rich who finds a map of a secret beach that suppose to be a place of paradise. The man that slid the map under his hotel door in Thailand killed himself right after he gave it to Rich. Rich later became bored with Thailand so he decided to seek out this perfect island, but he could not do it alone.  So he asks the couple next door to him if they want to go with him. They agree and the leave to go to the island. As the go on their journey many problems arise and even after they get there their problems don't end.  They end up facing many more dilemmas through out the novel.  THE BEACH is a very good novel and I would recommend it to anyone even the nonreader.
B00005B6C9|1.0|I've been a Bee Gees fan since the 70's and I just picked up a copy of this CD. I usually don't have to listen to Bee Gees albums before I buy them.But from now on I will. I think this album is a dissapointment.There is a little too much of Robin Gibb in this album.Barry Gibb sells albums. If Robin wants to be the main focus of the band he should go solo.If not he should get guitar lessons and contribute in other ways.There are a few bright spots on this album.Sacred Trust is good.Maurice's Walking on Air is also good.Barry's Technicolor Dreams has alot to be desired.If you liked to the last few albums you will be dissapointed with this one.
B000002J1C|5.0|&quot;The Yes Album&quot; was actually the third album from the group spearheaded by singer John Anderson, but represented enough significant differences from its two predecessors to constitute a new and bigger beginning for the progressive rock group.  Guitarist Steve Howe had replaced Peter Banks (who had gone off to join Blodwyn Pig, remember?), the album featured only original material, and the songs now tended to be much longer tracks.  The four longer tracks--&quot;Yours Is No Disgrace,&quot; &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; &quot;I've Seen All Good People,&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;--are structured similarly, although each allows for considerable instrumental freedom.  Usually a melodic theme is introduced by one member of the band and then echoed by the others.  On this particular album the stand out musician is, rather surprisingly, bassist Chris Squire.  Sometimes I think they made a mistake on the mix and pumped up the volume on the bass, but then it becomes clear this is by design.  Howe's guitar work as well as the organ played by Tony Kaye are given their moments to shine while Bill Bruford's drumming just stays out of the way.  However, the defining element of Yes is probably the vocal harmonies, with Howe and Squire blending with Anderson in the falsetto range, highlighted on &quot;All Good People.&quot;  It was this that made Yes unique from their most obvious British progressive rock counterpart Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.  However, the best is yet to come, with the additional of Rick Wakeman as the keyboard player and Anderson's continued exploration of oblique lyrics.
B000001E18|5.0|ZOOROPA, more than any single U2 album, inspires not just loathing and disappointment, but boredom, a shrug of the shoulders.  Americans do not like this album, and this is perhaps the main reason I love this album so much, because it speaks a different musical language.<br />U2 spent the 80s searching for America, searching for the roots of their own sound.  The soundscapes were vast and epic and each album grew in grandeur as the band, seemingly, became a metaphor for the subject that it was analyzing artistically.<br />Come the 90s, following the diasaster of Rattle and Hum, and U2 turned away from America and towards Europe, a dense, confused, tower of Babel.  ZOOROPA is the perfect symbol for the Europe that emerged from the ruins of the Cold War.  It is a hodge-podge, a mish-mash, that twists and turns and lacks a thematic, ideological center.  For Americans this is confusing, but for Europeans, especially those like myself who heard the pastiche of radio signals that heralds the title track, this was a heightening of immediate reality, a statement on the world that we occupied.  I am selfish with this album because of that simple reason, because it is a European album, a exploration of chaos and the tenuous foundations upon which the new world order was to be constructed. <br />ZOOROPA is a statement on history.
0792151712|4.0|I wish people would stop crushing this movie for innane reasons. Ok, it's FINE if you don't like it--diversity of opinion is what makes the world go 'round! But it would be highly desirable to know what you're talking about before you make a fool of yourself. For instance, one reviewer said that the movie would have been better if the Titanic actually reached NY. Well, it would have been DIFFERENT, except that the really Titanic sank more or less exactly as depicted in the film. Cameron made some gnarly mistakes with the script, but he wasn't stupid (or brilliant) enough to change history for his little blockbuster.   Another reviewer commented that what happened in the movie wasn't possible. Cameron's characters are all strong, if somewhat cliched, but everything they did was possible. Love is LOVE, no matter where you throw it in what era. Of course, social opinion has differed over the ages, and it always affects people, but if no one before now ever thought to go against public opinion, or choose happiness over wealth, we'd be nowhere. There is such a thing as human feeling... and doesn't the film make it perfectly obvious why Jack went to dinner with Rose? He'd saved her life! And anyway, nobody but Rose approved--at least, nobody but those people who were actually fooled into thinking Jack was first class, and those (like Andrews and Kathy Bates) who were too down-to-earth and reasonable to whine about Rose's dinner guest. And it's quite obvious that both Ruth and Cal went out of their way to embarrass Jack.    I suppose what I mean is that, while this movie has its faults (and some of them are pretty big) it's JUST a movie--a few people's idea of a good love story. It was historically accurated, entertaining, emotionally elavating and stimulating, etc. I agree that DiCaprio wasn't the best choice for Jack by far, but Winslet was incredible enough to make up for it, and anyway, he pulled it off OK.   So relax and don't bother to waste time bashing movies you may not have enjoyed. Find a movie you DID like, and review it.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Sarah's beautiful voice speaks to us from many different musical genres on this album. A Kansas favorite, &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; is buried in the midst of movie themes, classical favorites and even one of the most beautiful songs ever written for voice; &quot;Nessun Dorma.&quot;  The latter is a great one to listen to as the sun slips below the horizon at the close of the day, enjoying the beauty of nature.<br />The album has a &quot;New Age&quot; overtone to its production, especially in the percussion section.  Some of the arrangements are reminicent of Enya's or Enigma's work.  Overall, it has a musically rich, relaxing mood, great for a soak on a peaceful evening, or to calm your nerves after a rough day in the &quot;rat race.&quot;<br />If you enjoy clear, willowing vocals in a classically trained style, Sarah Brightman's &quot;Eden&quot; will be a welcome addition to your musical palette.  She paints a beautiful and soothing experience for us everytime she sings.

014100018X|5.0|Who in their right mind doesn't like Chocolate just a little bit? This book is kind of like its name.....you have to admire what it provides for you in its simplicity. Joanne Harris gives us simple delights in both the characterizations in the novel as well as the descriptions of the small French town. I particularly liked the alternating chapters from Vianne and Reynaud describing the events leading up to easter with each of their priorities being so different. Reynaud in the book is a far less likeable character than depicted in the movie, however, this makes the book even more entertaining. He is a real nut! The funny thing is that I have known people just like him. Vianne, on the other hand, is a complex character with a mysterious past that the reader can't help but want to win over the town with her tempting chocolatier's goods. She will always guess your favorites, but be prepared for so much more. I read the book after I saw the movie so I was delighted by both of them. In fact, I would recommend seeing the movie first so that you can enjoy the added depth and intricacies the book offers that the movie can not provide. Watch out for Armande, Luc, Caro, and Josephine.....each one will steal your heart in their own ways. The only problem was that I found myself craving chocolates while I read the book. My waistline was happy when I finished and started a different book. Enjoy!
B000002J1F|5.0|\\"Fragile\\" is the Yes album that has the progressive rock group's best known track \\"Roundabout,\\" but I would certainly side with those who count \\"Close to the Edge\\" as their best album (and the Billboard ratings support the idea since \\"Close to the Edge\\" made it to #3 and \\"Fragile\\" only to #4).  The big difference between this album released in December 1971 was that Rick Wakeman replaced Tony Kaye on keyboards.  While I have also preferred Keith Emerson as a keyboard artist you can certainly admire how Wakeman's flamboyant artistry is integrated into the Yes sound.<br /><br />What keeps this from being the group's best album are the little signs of pretentiousness with \\"Cans and Brahms\\" and \\"We Have Heaven.\\" Lose those tracks and \\"Fragile\\" is a pretty good ride from start to finish. The opening of \\"Roundabout\\" (which always sounds like the beginning of ELP's \\"In the Beginning\\"--is there an in-joke here I am missing?) features Steve Howe's nimble-fingered guitar playing before the rest of the band joins in on the fun that builds to a crescendo until all that is left is Wakeman's organ-simulated lake of water and Jon Anderson's pure voice. Chris Squire's bass and Bill Bruford's drumming stand out on \\"South Side Of The Sky,\\" but \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" is the album's monster track and the best example overall of the group's progressive rock style. Anderson's lyrics are cryptic at best, but listening to Yes was always about the evocative sounds not the meaning of the words.<br /><br />I read that \\"Fragile\\" was completed in less than two months because the group needed to help pay for all of Wakeman's equipment.  Because it was put together quickly there are really just four tracks featuring the entire group and five shorter pieces showcasing the individual band members.  So you have Anderson's overdubbed voice on \\"We Have Heaven,\\" Squire's playing lead bass on \\"The Fish,\\"  Bruford's drums on \\"Five Percent for Nothing,\\" Howe's playing classical guitar on \\"Mood for a Day,\\" and Wakeman's \\"Cans and Brhams,\\" where he takes a movement from Brahams's Fourth Symphony and creates a electronic keyboard fantasy.  The album was given a boost by an edited version of \\"Roundabout\\" that was released as a single and climbed to #13 on the Billboard chart.  Yes would not do better until 1983 with \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart,\\" which only emphasizes that the group's best tracks were not suited for AM Top Forty airplay.  Yes was an FM group perfectly content to devote an entire album side to one song, as they amply proved on \\"Close to an Edge.\\"\\"Cans and Brhams,\\" where he takes a movement from Brahams's Fourth Symphony and creates a electronic keyboard fantasy.

B00000269M|5.0|Michael Jackson had the insurmountable task of following up what was not only the biggest selling album of time, but a real cultural phenomenon.  Thriller was released in late 1982 and due to its success it took Mr. Jackson five years to release its follow-up.  While Bad obviously was not half as big as Thriller in terms of sales, it is still a great record.  The title track finds Mr. Jackson taking a defiant stance and instead of running away from trouble as he did in &quot;Beat It&quot;, he stakes it head-on.  &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; is a bright and sunny song that has an incredibly infectious groove.  &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; is a real treat as he duets with Stevie Wonder and you get to hear two masters at work.  &quot;Man In the Mirror&quot; is a spiritual song that begs one to look at themselves and see that we can all make a difference.  &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot; is a good ballad that is a duet with Siediah Garrett, the songs writer.  It was original written to be sung with Whitney Houston, but when she was unavailable, Ms. Garrett stepped in and does a nice good.  &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; is a blazing rocker and &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; is angry tirade against the circus atmosphere that his life had become due to the media.  &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is a pumping track that has vicious beat and tremendous vocal.  Bad does hold one record over Thriller, it became the first album to produce five number one singles (&quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, &quot;Man In the Mirror&quot; &amp; &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;).
6302150930|5.0|Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors, and I have this film adaptation of &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; to thank for it. I first saw it on cable - my sister told me not to bother with it because it was a long bore. I was curious and decided to give it a try anyway. Well, the film captivated me completely, and I found myself watching it over and over each time it aired. Filled with beautiful, haunting imagery, wonderful acting and cinematography, Hardy's tragic story came alive in Polanski's hands, and I was so swept up in Tess' sad tale that it stayed with me for years. I finally read the book as a college student, and was a amazed how faithful the director had kept to the text. I am sad this film is out of stock, as I have not seen it recently, yet still remember it vividly! I also recommend &quot;Jude&quot; with Kate Winslet and &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; with Julie Christie for fans of Hardy!

6304981635|5.0|As an african-american and a Muhammad Ali fan, I have to take my hat off to greatness when I see it in action. NO stranger to Bruce Lee fare, I still marvel at the movie each time I see it, including the first time I saw it in 1973, the year I graduated from high school. After watching more movies and studying Lee, I can see that what was on the screen was real. &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was so great my children memorized it scene for scene, and I still watch it when I can. But other than Bruce's incredible performances, the movie still as yet is a racist one. And I'll tell you why. First of all, take note of Jim Kelly's role. Jim Kelly was a hero of a number of Blaxpoitation movies and it was clear from the beginning of this movie that he would be treated differently from John Saxon and Lee, who were sent in undercover to check out the Asian crime lord. Kelly had to fight off poliec and steal their car in order to make it to the ship leaving for Asia. Secondly, he had few scenes with Bruce - most of his time was spent skinning and grinning in the face of novice John Saxon, who got way too much play considering his mediocrity. At any rate let's get to point three. Jim Kelly is stereotyped. Of the three  heroes, he is the one who is killed -- but only after being stereotyped. When the first evening of fighting is over and the three men are asked to relax, Lee passes it up, Saxon makes moves on the main moll, and Kelly wants three women to satisfy him -- and will send for more if he needs it. That wasn't very funny, but it fed into the stereotype of the sexual black stud.  In the fight scene with the Asian crime lord, Kelly is killed. But only after being degraded, out-classed and finally, beaten to a pulp. During one point in the fight scene, he lands atop two giggling Asian women. Humiliated. Other than the degradation of Jim Kelly and the undeserved emphasis on Saxon, Bruce's role alone is worth the price of admission. He is cat-quick, intelligent and uses thatone of a kind face inflection to make it clear that he is not to be messed with. He has avenged his sister's rape by the rather large white bad guy, and he has represented the British Government with dignity.
0812548094|1.0|Good writing consists of just a few basic things: interesting dialogue, concise sentences/paragraphs, and focused ideas/plot/characters. Sadly, none of Goodkind's works contain these three simple writing rules.<br />Interesting dialogue: &quot;You are a *special* person, Richard.&quot; &quot;You're my friend... That's what friends are for...&quot; This is really annoying when it comes up nearly every other page. Goodkind simplifies his dialogue to the point where an attentive reader will feel insulted. Come on, chum, we're not that retarded (unless you've been buying the whole damn series).<br />Concise sentences/paragraphs: Why in the hell is this book 1000 pages long? Even &quot;War and Peace&quot; isn't this long, and it's got enough epic plot to fill a hundred Goodkind novels. This boy needs an editor to distill this crap down. Longer does not equal better. (Read the Earthsea novels.)<br />Focused ideas/plot/characters: It's like wandering in Wonderland, but lacking Alice's cat. There are a quite a few focused ideas here: sexual perversion, gratuitous violence, defecation (read the part about the palace), cardboard relationships, cliches, etc. Unfocused include: truth, magic, characters, and plot. The magic system is unwieldy, insipid, and simplistic (additive and negative magics?!). Goodkind mentioned something about &quot;righteous anger&quot; in the first novel; good to see that &quot;righteous anger&quot; actually means &quot;righteous slaughter/murder.&quot; He should've told us earlier. Richard and Kahlan are like love-sick teenagers, and the combined IQ of these two is lower than my caesar salad. Actually, one should ask: What plot? If there is a meaningful plot here, I'll be amazed.<br />One could write an English doctoral thesis on Goodkind's usage, but his list of follies also includes all the &quot;borrowed&quot; ideas from Robert Jordan (who suffers many of the same problems) and Terry Brooks (ditto). We're going to keep on receiving crap in fantasyand science fiction until we demand better authors. At this point, it doesn't seem likely though...
B0000025F7|5.0|When Michael Jackson released Off The Wall in 1979, he was a mere 21 years old, but he had been in the business for a decade.  He had released several solo albums and singles (even topping the charts with &quot;Ben&quot; in 1972), but they were under the control of Motown. Off The Wall was his first real solo release as he was in charge.  Mr. Jackson was always thought of as an unique talent, but he blew away everyone's expectations with the album.  The album has a definite dance vibe, but although disco was at its height of popularity, the album doesn't fall in the disco category.  The songs have fat grooves that make you want to dance, but the core of the songs belong to Mr. Jackson and not the production as is the case with most disco songs.  &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot; is the album's first track and single.  It is a brilliant track with soaring strings and popping rhythms that has a spoken word intro that moves into a high falsetto.  Mr. Jackson sings the song in the falsetto, but he interjects spoken word into verses that provide an echo to the lead.  The song was a justifiable number one hit.  &quot;Rock With You&quot; was the second single and is much slower in its beat, but you can still groove to it.  It also topped the charts.  &quot;Working Day &amp; Night&quot; is a musical workout that sounds like a forerunner of &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot; from Thriller.  &quot;Get On The Floor&quot; is a fiery call to arms that in which he doesn't ask that you get up and dance, but demands it.  The title track has a funky vibe to it and &quot;Girlfriend&quot; is a Paul McCartney song that is pumped up a bit from its slight original, but is still the weakest track on the album.  &quot;She's Out Of My Life&quot; is a straight ballad that is sung with heartbreaking sincerity.  In fact Mr. Jackson literally broke down while singing it and you can hear the sobbing on the song.  &quot;Burn The Disco Out&quot; closes the album in apocalyptic fashion and is a perfect capper to the album.  Off The Wall was a major success that spawned four top ten hits, sold over 10 million copies but surprising never hit number one on the album charts, topping out at number three.  Although Thriller became a cultural phenomenon and the biggest selling album in music history for a time, many people consider Off The Wall his true masterpiece.n and is a perfect capper to the album.

0345350499|5.0|I first heard about The Mists of Avalon from my mom, because she and all of her women friends were reading it at the same time.  I was curious to know what the book was about, but I was far too young at the time to have understood it.  But just recently, I was searching the library for books on Arthur and Camelot and all of that sort of thing.  Then I remembered The Mists of Avalon, and decided to give it a try.<br />I must admit I am not completely finished reading it yet, but I have to say that I have never read a book like it.  It tells the story of King Arthur, but from the women's point of view.  I had always thought of Morgan as the evil sorceress, but now I see her only as a woman fighting to protect her religion, and way of life.<br />However, even though this is a wonderful book, I find it hard to sympathize with any of the characters except for Arthur.  Morgaine is certainly my favorite character, but even she seems somewhat cold and harsh.  Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere) is a pathetic, whiny girl; Viviane is a heartless woman thinking only of herself and of Avalon; Lancelet is just plain icky; and none of the other characters were that great.  But even so, the story is enthralling, and each day I look forward to reading it in the evening.<br />So if you like Arthurian legend, I would recommend you read this straight away.  It is definitely worth reading, and I can't see why anybody would want to give it less than 5 stars.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Arie's debut is so inspirational.  I haven't dug a CD like this since Lauryn Hill's Miseducation album.  <br />I play Brown Skin and Video over and over again--they're those songs that can define and shape an artist.  I hope to see more of Arie.  <br />Thank you for keeping it real with your lyrics and your beats!!!
B00003CXFG|4.0|As an African-American, I am glad any time the black man gets to be the hero. IN this case, Vin Diesel turns in a scene stealing portrayal of a hero who rises above his hatred to save a group of white folks, stranded on a planet that is about to turn -- PITCH BLACK! This movie pulled off what is so difficult in today's cinema: providing lighting in intensely dark situations. The movie is unique in that the creatures who lurk in the dark are only seen a few times; much of the time there are shadows, quick shots, and the rest is left to the human mind. The movie's twist, with Diesel outlasting the typical white hero, is evidence of what Hollywood can do when it goes beyond the formula and simply does the right thing. &quot;Pitch Black&quot; described the environment that the humans were placed in, and their trek to get back to the ship with only small light sticks to rely on (the white man's biggest fear is the dark), but Diesel, is also &quot;Pitch Black&quot; in regard to the lily-whiteness of the rest of the movie's characters.  Right on. We need to see him in more movies.
078401115X|5.0|is fully evident in this late 80s Alan Parker film, an overlooked classic if there ever was one.  In my opinion, no one then or now could do the job portraying detective Harry Angel that Rourke did.  He captures every nuance of the character perfectly, running the gamut from emotional wreckage to physical haggardness.  How someone so gifted could let said gift get away from him the way Rourke did is a mystery almost as compelling as the one serving as the subject of this film.<br />The basic storyline is deceptively simple; Harry Angel is a down and out post WWII New York detective hired by a shadowy figure to find a missing singer, one Johnny Favorite.  That search leads him from New York City to the bowels of the Louisiana bayou, and it's that setting that gives the film so much of its powerful atmosphere.  Things are not as they seem, and the story becomes stranger the further along it goes...  <br />Alan Parker did a fantastic job of using muted colors to convey the sense that this story is not taking place in our time, but rather one of a recently faded past.  Visually, the film transports you to that place and moment in a way that few &quot;period pieces&quot; manage to accomplish.  Add in his notorious attention to detail, and you have little doubt that you are seeing the deep south of Louisiana as it was in the 1950s.<br />The other major performances (Robert De Niro, Charlotte Rampling, Lisa Bonet, Brownie McGhee) are wonderful in their own right, but IMO, this is Rourke's show.  A modern classic!
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson is a rare artist who can easily slip in and out of all kinds of musical styles and genres.  From r&amp;b to rock to dance to fast songs to ballads, the self proclaimed King of Pop is chameleon-like in his approach.  Dangerous is another example of his variety.  &quot;Jam&quot; is a furious, beat heavy song and &quot;Why You Wanna Trip On Me&quot; is an intense number.  &quot;In The Closet&quot; has a slinky groove and &quot;Remember The Time&quot; has a silky smooth sound.  &quot;Heal The World&quot; attempts to be another &quot;We Are The World&quot;, but one can forgive him as you know his intentions are pure.  &quot;Black Or White&quot; has a jangly guitar riff that is the backbone of the song.  &quot;Give In To Me&quot; is a hard rocker and &quot;Will You Be There&quot; has a gospel like chorus.  Dangerous is an eclectic mixed bag that Mr. Jackson shows he is willing to mix it up and try different things.
0140177396|5.0|hmmm... from reading everyone else's review... i guess im juz thinking different or misinterpreting the story. From my point of view, I believe that this book's not just written upon the subject of discrimination of our social society, but it is written to show the loneliness of people and the effects of being lonely..  For example, the wife of Curley, the son of the owner of the farm, acts of more flutterishly toward because of her isolated life from the people of the world, and her preference of attention from everyone caused from this loneliness..., and also the old man Candy kept his dog to escape from his own world loneliness. The main characters  George and Lennie are also affected by being lonely. George has a habit of petting everything because from petting something you are sure of the fact that you are touching something that is alive, to enjoy the feeling of being next to someone escaping from the loneliness. George also tries to escape his loneliness by thinking of his dream house, where everyone will be happy and satisfied of their life.      Of course I'm not saying that the idea of the book is not written upon the subject of prejudice but I'm just expressing my own opinion. So no hard feelings -_-;; lol
B000059MEK|2.0|Daft Punk is another one of those bands that will always be filed under &quot;techno&quot; or &quot;dance&quot; without real justification.  Sure, maybe the music is purely electronic...but this album belongs in the R &amp; B or popular sections of music stores.  Musically, Discovery doesn't impress me very much.  The video for One More Time is interesting, but the song by itself isn't anything to get excited about. Most of the album chugs along at a slow pace, and I like my electronic music fast and intelligent. If you want some real techno, check out artists like Astral Projection, Man With No Name, and even Evil's Toy or Funker Vogt.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I am truly flabbergasted by the plethora of ignorant, asinine reviews listed below.  Frankly, those critics can E M A &amp; B.  That said, this DVD is one of the best I have ever seen.  Mike did an amazing job on this package and it really shows.  The sound quality kicks major hiney, and the performance brings tears to my eyes.  Few words can describe the feeling I get when I immerse myself in &quot;The Spirit Carries On,&quot; but let me just tell you that it gives me the chills.  The bonus material is phenomenal; kudos to the band, Teresa Thomson, and especially to Mike, whose dedication to his music and fans made this DVD what it really is -- a masterpiece.
B000002H2H|5.0|I'm more of a fan of newer bands,but this album has changed that. Metallica has introduced me to the old-school, which I find even better than my fomer tastes.I love this album. From the intense, machine-gunning riffs to the epic solos,every thing is good.&quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; is a great opener, beginning with an acoustic interlude, then catapulting into a blazingly fast metal song. The lyrical meaning revolves around mankind's demise at his own hands, via nuclear war. The title track is a heavy song that deals with unfair treatment of inmates, namely, the electric chair. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is a very epic song about dying needlessly in war, similar to &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; on Master of Puppets. &quot;Fade to Black&quot; is a slower song, which is based on being intensely depressed, to the point of suicide. The somber,melancholic tone definitely reflects the meaning. &quot;Escape&quot; is a weaker song, easily the lowlight on this particular disc. But then, it's better than most bands' best. &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; is probably about censorship, but the lyrics are somewhat vague. Then comes my favorite, &quot;Creeping Death&quot;. It is drawn from Exodus, in the Old Testament. It is based on the final plague of Egypt, the Angel of Death. Finally, the end track, &quot;Call of Ktulu&quot;, a reference to a horror story by H.P. Lovecraft. If you come across anything by that author, read it to this. Overall, this is an excellent album, worth every cent. Fans of new bands, as I was, check out any of Metallica's older discs. If you are already an old-school metalhead, you should have owned this since it came out. Just buy it !!
B000001GPX|5.0|When it comes to buying one of Beethoven symphonies on disc usually you have to choices: to go with the classics (Furtwangler, Klemperer, Walter) and their powerfull and insightfull approaches or to get a more modern approach (to Hogwood) sometimies with pretty strange results. To find a recording that stands somewhere between, that is both emotionally powerfull and yet full of energy of our time the choice isn't easy. And that's where Kleiber comes in. With an extremely responsive orchestra and impecable recorded sound Kleiber gets the perfect balance between classic and modern interpretation. All the tension we were used by conductors like Furtwangler and all the grisp of someone like Karajan is there in a perfect combination of something that must be one of the landmarks in recorded Beethoven and in recorded music of all times. Buy this CD and listen to it. It's as rewarding as people here say. Definitely an essential recording.
B00004XMV6|3.0|This is a love it or hate it story. If you can put that aside you will notice that the imagery and quality of the filmmaking is excellent. It evokes emotion just by the sights. You can almost smell the incense and  feel the dank air in the City -- it is simply a very well made film. That said, the transfer to DVD looks like the film had been left to rot in a vault. This may be the best transfer possible but I certainly hope not. I have 8 mm vacation films that are 3 times as old but in better condition then the transfer to DVD makes this film look. So while it is an excellent filmed experience, the DVD give you a digital copy of a very flawed film.
0060930187|4.0|I read The Bell Jar for a research paper on Sylvia Plath. As I researched info on her life, I was amazed at the events that happened to her that ended up in the novel. The first part of the novel is very funny. The humor slows down at the climax, and stays there for a bit during the conclusion. However, by the end of the book, I felt that I had read everything that was happening before. It was a lot like Girl, Interrupted's hospital, and I realize that this book was the forerunner for these psychological memoirs.
B000002H33|5.0|Like I said on a previous reveiw, Metallica changed my tastes from new metal to the classics. This album, as many have lamented, is Metallica in top form. The 90's Metallica is nothing like this. Their new stuff is less complicated and more radio-friendly. But back to this album. It rocks savagely. I won't give a synopsis of every song,'cause that might fill more than a thousand words. The twin axe attack of Hetfield and Hammet is enough to send poseurs like Kid Rock into hiding. Cliff's bass playing isn't as distinct as some may like, but it is there. And he proves why he's considered the best. And if Lars still played like this, perhaps he wouldn't sue small companies. But that's beside the point. You can't name standouts on here, every song is great. Please, do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this immediately.
6300214354|5.0|Along with Airplane! I consider this to be the best work of the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team.  The jokes don't always work as well as those in Airplane! (although they are just as good as any in the Naked Gun movies) and are a little less relentless in their pacing, but the plot actually plays an important role in this film, moreso than any other ZAZ film, so these minor deficits are balanced out by the overall structure of the film.  While the plot in airplane clearly took a back seat to the skits, Top Secret acts better as a satire of a particular genre (the spy film) than either Naked Gun or Airplane.  It is also interesting seeing a ZAZ film without Leslie Neilson (Hot Shots, though good, doesn't count).
B00004U8H4|4.0|Based on the book, American Psyco is a dark satire.  It takes a look at some very privilaged young men doing very bad things during the late 1980's.  One of these rich Ceo's just so happens to be a mass murderer.  Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale, takes you into his world; revealing his nightly blood lust.  The film is brilliantly directed.  Christian Bale is remarkable!  The film is very violent but not nearly as bad as the book. Watch for when Patrick tests to see if anyone is listening and says off-the-cuff remarks.                               enjoy!                        Allison W.
B000002KNY|5.0|I recently listened to &quot;Fear of Music&quot; after not hearing it for about, say, fifteen years.  So, it was fun to be reacquainted with an old friend.<br />&quot;Fear of Music&quot; sounds as fresh and original today as it did when it came out in 1979.  Unlike some of the Heads' later work, this album doesn't sound dated.  It fits beautifully after the first two studio recordings, sounding both more assured and more experimental than either.<br />I'm one who believes MTV killed rock music.  Albums such as &quot;Fear of Music&quot; and &quot;Remain in Light&quot; would be viewed as unmarketable by today's major record labels.  I hope lots of young people snatch up copies of both of those albums and really, truly listen  to them.  I think they will surely open up a few young minds.  As for us older folks, we can look back, longingly, at the brilliance that was.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Do I really need to restate all of the other reveiws? It's the Matrix!! The best film of the 90's!! It has everything. The great plot, the intense action, and the jaw-dropping special effects, it is all superb. My all-time favorite film, if you care to know. I'm sorry if I sound as though I'm hyping this movie, it just that good. So buy it, preferably many copies, and watch.
B000056K04|3.0|This review is coming from after about two months of owning this album - a more than reasonable amount of time to make a true judgement. Two months after Before These Crowded Streets was released, I made up my mind that it was an awesome album, and was listneing to it everyday. Can't make a nice, little pun for this album - let me just say that Everyday is far, far under par for the Dave Matthews Band. There are songs on this album that I could see on their previous works (&quot;If I Had It All&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot;), but as a whole, this album...stinks. It truly is a great rock album, but a mediocre DMB album. I also think Glen Ballard is really good at what he does, but he just shouldn't do it for Dave Matthews Band. Speaking of doing it, &quot;I Did It&quot; doesn't! Neither does &quot;Dreams of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;What You Are&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Who is this band? I'll admit - I like these songs, but knowing it's coming from DMB, the same people that brought us &quot;Two Step&quot;, &quot;#41&quot;, &quot;The Stone&quot;, &quot;Crush&quot;, etc., makes me...not like them. Now we all know that it would be hard for DMB to make another Under the Table and Dreaming or Before These Crowded Streets, so with that thinking - let's HOPE they never make another Everyday.

I admire the fact that AC/DC never cared about other peoples opinions, they just went forward, delivering good old rocking. And they are loyal guy, too. But I beg them: if they are going to continue, replace Brian Johnson. They can always give some kind of big check to reapy for losses and Brian will go on collecting his albunsroyalties. My God, he just doesnt sing in this CD !!! His voice is gone !!! Myself could be singing here !!! It seems a cat screaming trapped inside a bag !!! Gooosh !!!

The way that Kenneth Branagh directs his movies is so professional and so amazing that, from my point of view, I think that if I would see the same movie by a different director, I wouldn't of LOVED it as much as I adore Branagh's movies. Kenneth Branagh is my favorite actor and director which may be the reason I think that. But what is the reason that he is my favorite actor and director?

0316926345|4.0|I loved reading this book for two reasons, first it completely transported me into another country and into another era. Second, it captured the sheer joy of youthful friendship, where the responsibilities and trials of later life have not yet taken their toll.  <br />To me, the book realisticly portrayed the drama of life and how life's experiences change not only a persons outlook on life, but changes the dynamics between friends with whom, at some point, we felt we could never live without.  What causes friendships that were once so close, to gradually fade away?  This poetic tale allows you to ponder the delicate nature of both friendships and romantic relationships.   Every once in a while you get in the mood for a story that will leave you in an introspective, if not melancholy mood......this is such a story.
B000051YEG|5.0|Ahh the joy's of the mighty Serge... Unless you've had your head under a rock you've probably been hearing high praise for this record for some time now... hushed wispers of its legendary weirdness... well the word on the street is right my friends.. this is an incredible record by any stretch of the imagination.  First up this is basically Serges most &quot;rock&quot; oriented record.. but let me clarify that by saying Serge's take on &quot;rock&quot; is a tweaked out as his take on pretty much everything in life ... so the sound is very weird.. very sparse .. very repetitive.. but at the same time huge and massive (one of the greatest bass tones ever recorded.. and some of the craziest funky drummin' ever) ... then there's the strings which literally sound as if they're bein beamed in from another record somewhere else.. out of this world! ...  yeah its as good as everything you've heard about it... and if you've been dissipointed or hesistant to get into Serge I point you in this lil beauty's direction otherwise your missing out on one of the greatest records of all time...

B000002H33|5.0|Where do I begin? This was probably a question that perplexed us all in writing a review for this CD. The heavy crunch, crunch style of music will be an everlasting echo in your brain if you have this CD. No denying the power of Master of Puppets and the rest of it's cohorts, this album surpasses every other album, including Metallica Albums. Although my favorite song One is'nt on this album, this is still my favorite CD. If you compare Master to what people were hearing on the radio and MTV, Metallica would, and still would, eat them alive. Frizzy hair and songs talking about girls, girls, girls, were not even in the thought process of Hetfield and the rest of the boys. Writing about insanity, drugs, and wanting to beat the hell out of people is what James was thinking. How could you go wrong. Since I was born in just 1983, I did'nt get this album until I was 15. I had never heard any music like it, it was simply CRAZY.To put in the simplest of terms, this is the album that defined the REAL Metallica, and perfected the metal music that Ozzy and Black Sabbath invented. If you really wanna piss your parents off, it just costs 15 bucks, and that's a bargain. A well put together album that will give you a major headache, keep up the good work boys.
B000059H99|3.0|This review refers to the DVD version.  Although I love Rocky and consider it one of my all tiem favorites, I was disappointed with the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  There is almost no sound in the rear channels.  Now I realize Rocky is not a special effects movie, but there were times those channels should have been used such as the fight sequence.  Almost the entire soundtrack is through the center channel.  To be honest I don't now how they get away with calling it Dolby 5.1.  In terms of picture quality there are several glitches throughout the movie, but it is ok for the most part.<br />Also not all of the movies in the DVD 5 pack are Widescreen anamorphic.  It is nice to have Rocky in widescreen DVD, but don't expect the same overall quality as other DVDs.  Maybe that's why this DVD is cheaper than most good DVDs.<br />Movie Rating: 4.5 DVD Rating: 2.0 Overall Rating: 3.0
068484267X|5.0|This book is the account of Frank McCourt and the reminiscences of his childhood spent in Ireland. The story is told from the perspective of young Francis Mccourt, from the young age of 5 until he hits the age of 19, and we see him mature before our own eyes as the writing manner changes from chapter to chapter. This is a story of how Francis McCourt lived and survived through the desolation of his childhood, with a drunken father. The start of the book is very depressing, with the death of Frank's baby sister, following deaths of his twin brothers, many parts of the books still have funny descriptions. I found myself laughing along the way reading this book and defiantly putting a smile on my face. It is truly amazing the kid has not gone into depression in such an inconsiderate atmosphere. He even had dreams of going to America and earning big bucks, which many had tried to convince him to forget. Frank is one determined person to succeed. This is a book not to miss, the insight of Frank is truly amazing and you see life through a totally different light!

This movie Almost famous has a great story line and a great happy ending.  I also recomend the movie The Lengand Of Bagger Vance staring Will Smith.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd has made some of the most powerful music in rock history, but none of their albums manage to reach the importance and grandeur of 1973's Dark Side of the Moon.   Since their formation in 1966, the band's compositions progressively pointed to the conceptual perfection found in this amazing song cycle.  <br />Even as early as 1968, with &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets,&quot; the group was forming multi-sectioned song ideas.  A single from the same year, &quot;Careful With That Axe Eugene,&quot; with its quiet start and explosive ending,  contained an evolution of emotion that was very important to the developing Pink Floyd sound.  Movie soundtracks such as More (1969) and Obscured by Clouds (1972) fed Roger Water's desire to make albums that were much more than a collection of British pop songs.   Atom Heart Mother in 1970 showed even more growth from the band.  \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" experimented with sound effects.  The &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; suite, which covered an entire album side, was their first attempt at a lengthy piece.  This was improved upon in &quot;Echoes&quot; from Meddle (1971).  All this led to the creation of a piece of music that would stand on its own as a full listening experience.<br />The concept is simple, yet deep at the same time.  Things that drive mankind mad: wealth, conserving/wasting time, and failed interaction with others.  There are tape recorded interviews that pop up from time to time creating a very erie feel.  And the engineering of the recording is flawless.<br />Dark Side of the Moon has a fluid, cohesive feel to it that is never interrupted throughout its 42 minutes.  From beginning to end, there are no low points. Challengers to this will point to moments that are fully justified by the context of the album.  For example, the drum intro to &quot;Time&quot; might be looked upon as too long, but when the listener realizes what the song is about, it fits in like a glove.  The female, non-lyrical vocal in &quot;Any Color You Like&quot; may seem tedious at first listen, but then it sets the perfect tone for the pause before &quot;Money.&quot;  Which brings up an interesting point.  The break point between albums sides could not have occurred at a better spot.  While listening to the CD version of the album, this pause has a very dramatic effect.  It's as if Waters had the digital age in mind.  The beginning of the album is effective as well.  It starts  with a heartbeat, followed by a collage of sounds from later songs, and then &quot;Breathe in the Air,&quot; a perfect opener.   The same can be said for the end of the record, the  Roger Waters composition &quot;Eclipse.&quot;  Waters has been notorious for his songs with lists as lyrics, but this one works perfectly. It feels like something great is coming to a close, and indeed it is.  <br />There would be other great Pink Floyd Albums, most notably Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.  They are some of the great achievements of rock, but Dark Side of the Moon is perfect.
B000000WCA|5.0|This is one of my favorite pop music CDs ever. For some weird reason Europeans write better pop music than America. Unlike Britney Spears' pop-dance songs that recycle the same melody and rhythm and just change the lyrics, each song in this album is unique and has a different vibe that is distinguishable from each track to another. &quot;Wannabe&quot; is a strong pop song that screams just what the Spice Girls want out of their mouths, which is GIRL POWER all the way. &quot;Say You'll Be There&quot; shows the vocal harmony of the girls, and &quot;2 Become 1&quot; is a beautifully-written pop ballad. The lyrics are just right and the girls sound great in this song. &quot;Mama&quot; is a perfect song to sing to your mother, for a pop song, it sure seems to sound straight from their hearts. Other songs like &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;, &quot;Love Thing&quot; (I LOVE the interchanging of Geri and Mel B's rapping here) and &quot;If You Can't Dance&quot; are great songs with a good vibe and vocals to listen to. Great album.

The symbols and underlying themes are  told through the innocence of the young child, Scout.  This brings an interesting point of view  to the story because she does not understand the stereotypes that exist in her  small town.  She also doesn't  realize that complications that her dad, a lawyer faces.  Social standings and relationships  between family, friends, and neighbors are explored in this story. The book starts at the end of the story, and there is a flashback through  all of Scout's adventures.  This  book is an exciting collection of events in Scout 's life that together reflect  on society as a whole.  This social  commentary by Harper Lee, shows how a young girl who hasn 't been subjected to  the prejudicial views of society is able to judge character better than  wise  adults that have been through many experiences.  To Kill A Mockingbird is fun summer reading, that leaves the reader with something to think  about.
B00005B3Z6|3.0|After carefully examining both versions, I am moved by the US version simply because it's relates to my cultural lifestyle and the influences America embraces. I won't say the British series is &quot;less of&quot; in any way. Both versions have their merits but an All-American gay boy coming from the US will most certainly relate much better with the US version simply because of &quot;culture&quot; which in-turn will make it far more entertaining and easier to understand. I wouldn't say making something easier to understand \\"dumb downed.&quot; That's just a cheap shot as far as I am concerned in doing a fair review. America is just beginning to understand the whole &quot;gay community&quot; and it's philosophies (if it has any) &lt;grin&gt;. QAF-USA has developed a huge audience made of not only gay people but everyone!  Education seems to be the main focus for this series as many of it's stars and producers... convey in their chat interviews. The US version is most certainly made to educate and entertain, which it most certainly does. The British version (although educates somewhat) seems more in tune to entertain the audience. Rightly so! The British version broke new ground and pushed the envelope on the way Europeans watch prime time TV. That's something that will probably never happen in America-so BRAVO for the UK! If you really want to have a smidgen of understanding the &quot;core&quot; story, I suggest you purchase the first 8 episode DVD British version first and then start watching the more amplified characterization in the US version. You'll see why the US series is quickly becoming one of the most popular and most successful television shows in history. I also suggest you purchase the kickin US soundtrack, which will most certainly get you in the QAF mood. Cheers!
B000000WF9|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible.  It blends into the movie perfectly.  When I listen to it, I can see images of the movie in my mind and make me wish to see the movie again.  At times the soundtrack is dark, but that is what makes it so good.  It touches you at a deep level and makes you wish the soundtrack was even longer.  I rank this soundtrack in my top five of all time. (Gattaca, Last of the Mohicans, fifth Element, The Rock, Star Wars)  If your looking for a dark and moody soundtrack, then I whole heartedly suggest this one.
B000002NHN|5.0|I feel that Loreena McKennitt is one of the most important composers of our time.  She writes musical pieces that I believe the world will treasure forever.<br />She uses her well-ranged, but generally soprano voice in a semi-operatic fashion.  Sometimes, she borrows poems from other places and times, and sets them to music.  Other times, she writes her own words.  But the rich, multi-layered, almost orchestraic music she composes in the background is what really makes her albums brilliant.  Not that her voice by itself isn't lovely.<br />This is classy music for rich-hearted music lovers.  If you only buy one Loreena McKennitt album, I think The Book of Secrets is the one.  But you'd be crazy to buy only one.  Buy the rest of them too!  And keep them in fancy jeweled cases, showcased prominently in your living room.  Because you will soon consider each of them to be a treasure.
B00000099Y|5.0|This cd contains a song who's lyrics are a recipe for cookies. Not only that but the cookies contain marijuana and the song is in german. If you did not know this before hearing that song, you would think you were listening to some sort of Nazi pep-rally. This is just a minor example of the things Ænima can do to your mind. This cd takes a while to get used to, but after you do, you will be breathing along with Maynard (tool's lead singer) in the the beggining of Ænema (yes it is supposed to be spelled differently from the cd title). This cd will take you places mentally that you can not imagine. I seriously recommend this cd. It is one of the best investments i've made in my life.
B00004XPP0|5.0|i love Star Wars and these three movies are just the best!  i mean, lots of people agree with me - it has the biggest cult following of any sci-fi thingos in the history of Earth!  P.S. Obi is the best. -Little Jedi-
B000059ZLH|5.0|I thought the DVD was absolutely amazing.  The bonus material was more than I could ever have asked for, and the audio commentary by the band showed me a whole new side of my favorite musicians that I never knew existed.  Being an avid Dream Theater fan, this DVD adds more to my collection than anything else from them that I own.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|This is 1 of the best bands ive heard in a while. They sound a lot like Rage Against The Machine but the only problem with this cd is that there singer really cant rap. I'm not dissing the dude or anything but if u stack his rapping skills up 2 Fred Durst or Zach from RATM then ull see that he really cant rap 2 good. Its a good cd thouhg and u need 2 get this  be4 they sellout n e more. Ive been a fan of this band sinse day 1 and teenyboppers are starting 2 like them.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen on DVD. I have the earlier VHS version and the difference is unbelievable. The color on DVD is magnificent and having the DVD option of Dolby sound makes the score sound incredible. In its entirety, the film colors are rich and true. Omar Sharif's robes are totally black not grey and Peter O'toole's white robes are breathtaking. Omars eyes are rich and liquid brown, the skies are blue with white clouds, and the camels harnesses are beautiful bright and multicolored. The desert sands are tan colored, light brown and all hues in between, shifting ever so slightly from scene to scene. And the acting is beyond any I have seen in many many years. Peter O'toole should have an Oscar on his mantle because he made T.E. Lawrence a reality for me, so much so that since buying this DVD, I have bought and am reading T.E. Lawrence's book about his campaign in the desert &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom.&quot; A five star event made unforgettable on DVD forever.
B000005IU2|1.0|I heard about the stooges on the vh1 punk show and a few people told me this is a clasic punk cd but guess what it aint punk. This sounds like the Rolling Stones or something u have a serius problem if u think its punk. Check out NOFX, Lag wagon, MxPx, American Hifi, Sr-71, SUM41, Good Charlote, or Dead Kennedie's if u want 2 hear what real punk sounds like.
B000003BF4|5.0|Wow, is the Editorial Review ever off the mark here.<br />The 3 greatest live albums of all time are the Who's LIVE AT LEEDS, Bob Marley and the Wailers' LIVE, and the Rolling Stones GET YER YA-YA'S OUT.<br />The Stones are all power, vim &amp; vigor on this LP.  Mick sings, instead of screaming as he does on some of their other live LPs.  Wyman &amp; Watts are rock solid as always, and Keith runs the band, as he seems to do in all of their best moments.<br />What makes this a classic album instead of just a very good live LP is Mick Taylor, who is just crushing throughout, a dominating guitar player.  Am I the only one who thinks the Stones were at their best during the brief period when Taylor played guitar with them?<br />&quot;Stay Cat Blues,&quot; &quot;Love In Vain,&quot; and &quot;Live With Me&quot; are all better here, much more rocking, than the studio versions.  <br />For me, the highlight here is &quot;Midnight Rambler,&quot; which I could argue is the best thing the Stones ever recorded.  From the opening strains, with the crowd doing some off color chant, the chugga-chugga guitars and multiple time changes make this a true Rock classic, best played EXTREMELY LOUD.  The responses from the crowd, during the slow section toward the end, give me chills.<br />I love this LP.  I don't know that I would consider the Stones a first rate Rock'n'Roll band if they hadn't released GET YER YA YA'S OUT.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|I viewed the 2001 DVD release of &quot;Triumph of the Will,&quot; and I must say I am not disappointed in the least. The pictures are crisper than the VHS copy I own, and this version has the added benefit of an audio commentary and a Leni Riefenstahl short film called &quot;Day of Freedom.&quot; The audio commentary is like a historian sitting with you and explaining all the idiosyncracies of the featured members of the Nazi Party. He tells you who the key players in the film are, what they did during the war, and how they died. Some from old age, and some through execution or suicide. It is truly an educational experience for the dedicated film fan, and one that you should not miss.<br />I must say that if you are hesitating to purchasing this film due to its subject matter, fear not. While the film is propagandist garbage, the cinematography is the real reason to buy it. Maybe most important of all, portions of each DVD sale go to the National Halocaust Museum in Washington D.C. That may ease your mind a bit, but I thoroughly encourage you to buy this document of Nazi propaganda. Let the Jewish words of, &quot;Never Forget,&quot; remain in our collective consciences forever.
B000000W5B|3.0|It's a funny thing.  When the Stones are at their worst, as they are here, Keith always drops a real jem into the album that I can't resist.<br />In this case, it's &quot;Coming Down Again.&quot;  Like all of the album, the lyrics are all over the place, and the guitars are a bit lazy, but the effect is sweeter than anything else on this misguided record.<br />Some of this--&quot;Dancing With Mr. D,&quot; &quot;Can You Hear The Music,&quot; and &quot;Hide Your Love&quot;--are among the worst recordings of the Stones nearly 40-year career.<br />The fact that a couple of FM-radio staples, &quot;Angie&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; are included doesn't keep this from being a let down of major league proportions.<br />It's unfortunate that &quot;Star Star&quot; was saddled with the dirtiest lyric of the 1970s, making it impossible to get it on the radio, because it is the best thing here.  Dirty, raucus, and right on the verge of slipping out of control by records end, it perfectly defines the Stones in the mid-1970s.
B000056K04|2.0|I grew up in Virginia.  Dave Matthews used to play W&amp;L parties, the Virginia Horse Center, UVa and William and Mary all the time, and his classic, energetic shows full of songs that no one else but his band could play have come to define a sweet, warm summer evening for me in my early adulthood.  I have seen him live at least once every year since 1996...<br />But, (and you were waiting for that &quot;But&quot; I'm sure), I won't be going to see Dave this year.  Not because I do not like his music, but because I will not enjoy this album played live.  Oh sure, maybe if Dave went on tour with Sting and His band, this might translate well, but since we're talking about the other 4 members of DMB being forced to play parts that aren't there, I shan't bother. <br />Those of you who caught onto DMB after &quot;Remember Two Things&quot; or &quot;Under the Table&quot; will know exactly what I'm talking about.  There's an energy in those albums this CD comes nowhere close to replicating, if for no other reason than the underside of this disc has Glen Ballard's greasy fingerprints all over it, thus effectively smudging any real impact from Boyd or Leroi on the music.  The two stars is salvaged only by &quot;Everyday&quot;, which listeners of &quot;Live at Red Rocks&quot; will catch as a nascent &quot;#36&quot; with the catchy chorus &quot;Honey Honey, come and Dance with me&quot;.  <br />Not to advocate an illegal practice, but if you can, score a burned copy of the Lillywhite Sessions.  A bittersweet footnote in this otherwise depressing story--only because that's the album that could have been, and this is what we got instead.<br />Sorry Dave.  Maybe next year.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a great album. To someone earlier who said Hendrix was better: consider what Paul McCartney said, &quot;The greatest compliment was when I saw Jimi Hendrix play a club in London, and SGT. PEPPER had been out only 2 days. And Hendrix opened the show playing the song SGT. PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.&quot; So even Hendrix liked this album. If he liked it, the rest of us who like it must have pretty good taste.
B00000IMTE|4.0|Rainbow was formed in 1975 by lead guitar legend Ritchie Blackmore immediately after leaving Deep Purple.  He met and struck up a friendship with Ronnie James Dio, who was fronting the bluesy hard rock band Elf.  Ritchie was so impressed with Ronnie and the band that he formed Rainbow out of Elf.  In other words, when they first began, Rainbow was basically Elf (minus their own lead guitarist, of course) plus Ritchie Blackmore.<br />Although Elf was basically a bar-room boogie band, both Ritchie and Ronnie envisioned Rainbow to be more of a progressive metal outfit with lyrics concentrating on mystical, medieval, and occult themes.  This is why Rainbow's first record has both of these styles represented on it.<br />It begins with what might be the greatest Rainbow song ever (certainly one of their greatest anyway, as well as one of THE best songs from 1975), a 4 1/2-minute song called &quot;Man On The Silver Mountain.&quot;  This is the original song that defined Rainbow's music:  it starts with a good basic electric guitar riff, then the bass, drums and keyboards join in for support, and when Ronnie James Dio starts to sing, it quickly begins to take shape as the progressive heavy metal song it is.  And it has one amazing guitar solo by Ritchie Blackmore!<br />&quot;Self Portrait&quot; is also a dynamic prog-metal tune, but &quot;Black Sheep Of The Family&quot; is a straight-ahead, slightly bluesy hard rock tune with some great slide guitar work by Blackmore, and is obviously one of the Elf-penned contributions to this record.  It is also quite infectious; once you hear it, you can't get it out of your mind for hours.<br />&quot;Catch The Rainbow,&quot; at six and a half minutes long, is the only long song on this album, and is also the most progressive-sounding.  It's the one that really paved the way for their next album &quot;Rising,&quot; as it sounds more similar to the songs on that record than anything on this one.  It's a nice, introspective tune.  &quot;Snake Charmer&quot; is almost the opposite; it is a short, loud, brash song that contains a lot of Dio-screaming on it. &quot;The Temple Of The King&quot; gets Rainbow back into fine progressive form, with lyrics conjuring up the medieval.  The, they do a sudden roots-rock-about-face with the VERY Elf-sounding, piano-and-bass-driven, ultra-infectious &quot;If You Don't Like Rock 'N' Roll,&quot; which some reviewers have dismissed on here, but I think it provides a neat departure for Rainbow on this album.  Besides, it shows all of us where Ronnie James Dio really came from (no, not Hell):  He came from rock's early days. That's right, he formed his very first band all the way back in 1958, called Ronnie and The Rumblers, so you can tell that he still had some of that influence left in him by the time this album was made.  I think it's pretty cool. :)<br />The CD winds down with &quot;Sixteenth-Century Greensleeves&quot; and &quot;Still I'm Sad.&quot;  The former is probably the most medieval-sounding track on here, about a revolt against a tyrant, with some evil-sounding singing by Dio.  The latter is simply one of the greatest heavy metal instumentals ever, with fast time-changes on bass and drums, and absolutely amazing guitar fretwork by The Man In Black.<br />If you know only a couple of their later hit songs, then give early Rainbow a try, especially if you already like Deep Purple.  Some of these songs are very Deep Purple-ish.  If you also like Ronnie James Dio's 80's stuff, then this CD is for you!  And...If you don't like rock 'n' roll, THEN YOU'RE TOO LATE NOW! :)
630528069X|4.0|N.Y.C.Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) arrives in Los Angeles.Its Christmas,so people expect good will,and presents from each other.But in a place high enough to see all of L.A.,McClane only wants to see his wife.The International gate-crashing terrorists who are not in party mood, want to take full control of the building,speak to Mr Takagi,and steal $640,000,000 of bonds in a high tech vault.The Leader of the terrorists is Hans Gruber,a well dressed,well spoken recipient of a classical education.Hans wants the cash,but expects local law enforcement to not co-operate.But Hans did not expect local to be on the next level.Die Hard is without a doubt a non-stop display of thrilling action scenes,and a good performance by Bruce Willis as McClane.Alexander Godunov as Gruber's evil sidekick is excellent,displaying a touch of the psychotic.However,Alan Rickman gives a flawless performance as Hans Gruber,a ruthless,determined,more refined type of terrorist,a performance that literally commands attention,and probably what has become the first thing many people remember,when &quot;Die Hard&quot; is mentioned.4.5/5 for the film.The picture quality on this DVD,while not enhanced for widescreen televisions,is clear and sharp throughout.Minor grain can be seen,on the darkest of scenes.Shown in original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.The sound quality on this DVD is very good,especially the explosions and gunfire,and the more orchestrated parts,well defined.The speech was very clear.4/5.Overall &quot;Die Hard&quot; on this DVD is a good buy for any fan of the genre,and of Bruce Willis,or Alan Rickman.Not advertised on the actual disc packaging,is a very short featurette,lasting only a few minutes,adds a little extra interest,but hardly worth writing home about.Perhaps a special edition in the future with more extras,and an enhanced widescreen format (which would benefit both aspects),and a commentary by Director John McTiernan,is something Twentieth Century Fox should consider.
B000056K04|4.0|Granted this is not a &quot;typical&quot; DMB album, but I give them credit for trying something new.  In a time when most bands churn out the same music album to album DMB did something new by giving a violin and sax a lead role in its music.  Now on &quot;EVERYDAY&quot; they try some thing different and I applaud them for it.  This is by no means their best album, but it is still a quality work.<br />For those people who want a band to keep playing the same type of tunes over and over go listen to Creed, Third Eye Blind, and just about everyone else on the radio.  As for DMB and &quot;EVERYDAY&quot; I enjoy it and think it is a nice change of pace for the band.  &quot;EVERYDAY&quot; has the traditional songs like &quot;The Space Between&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot;.  It also tries new material like &quot;When the World Ends&quot; and &quot;Fool to Think&quot;.  I really like this album and think a refreshing mix of music, which is the essence of DMB.
B00004TDTO|5.0|An outstanding achievement in every respect.Took me right back to the first time i saw it.&quot;Jaws&quot;,one of those films with a rare lasting quality.You know that when a film is memorable for so many things,you can't remember them all,it's something special.In particular,the scene where Quint meets his death;the first time i saw that scene,it totally blew me away,and also,the look on Brody's face,as he watches,helplessly! What's the point in me going in to detail about other scenes?It would spoil your'e enjoyment of what must be,one of the greatest films of all time.In addition,this Universal DVD presents Jaws in it's original aspect ratio (2.35:1),and because the full width can now be seen,greater detail is visible.The actual picture ranges from sharp to extremely sharp-the daylight boat scenes look exceptionally clear.The Dolby Digital 5.1 track on this DVD,is,in a word,awesome.That classic,haunting Jaws theme is re-produced crystal clear.Great film,great extras,great everything.To date,one of the best DVD's out there.
B000003B6J|5.0|Ok well, you might ask yourself, who is the NWA? They ain't just some fools from Compton, they compose of six of the most lethal rappers who ever touched a mic, and one of the most creative DJ's who is known to create chaos on the wheels of steel (Technics 1200 turntable). You got people like Dr Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E providing lyrics that cross the line of explict by a mile. If that isn't enough you have MC Ren, The D.O.C. and Arabian Prince (Brother Rab) in the backseat also spitting madness on the album. The whole CD in general has its highs, and lows. Also it provides a variety of styles. &quot;COMPTON'S N THE HOUSE (REMIX)&quot; is Dre and MC Ren rapping live on stage with cutting by Yella. &quot;STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON&quot; is a classic gangsta rap track with really dope bass and beat production by Dr Dre. Eazy-E's &quot;8-BALL (REMIX)&quot; is a story about him and his beer which sounds very familar for its 1988 setting. If you want to hear the explict lyrics I was talking about listen to &quot;GANGSTA GANGSTA&quot; AND &quot;F--- THA POLICE&quot; with heavy influence from Ice Cube. My personal favorite is when the NWA combines some of its electro beats with hip-hop flavor when Arabian Prince and the rest of the NWA on the track &quot;SOMETHING TO DANCE TO&quot;. Also upcoming star The D.O.C. who was famous for his song &quot;IT'S FUNKY ENOUGH&quot; which was released a year later, appears on &quot;PARENTAL DISCRETION IS ADVISED&quot;. The ONLY &quot;clean&quot; tracks on the album are &quot;SOMETHING TO DANCE TO&quot;, &quot;QUIET ON THA SET&quot;, and &quot;EXPRESS YOURSELF&quot;. But don't let this album get to your head. When you listen to it, remember that these guys told everyone in interviews that they aren't gangbangers, they just use that image to make money. For example, Ice Cube isn't really from the &quot;hood&quot;. He went to the classy San Fernando Valley High School and took drafting classes at a university in Arizona. Dr Dre and Yella bothwere part of the famous World Class Wreckin Cru who performed songs wearing sequins, make-up, lip gloss, and more. You might know Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Dr Dre, and MC Ren for their solo CDs, but you haven't really been a fan of them until you peep this album first. This is NWA's second album and went gold when it orginally released in 1988. Enjoy the album when you get it though, this is really a classic in any old skool or gangsta rap collection.
B00005AFVR|5.0|There's been a lot written about this offering so I'm not going to waste too much space. Music is subjective. People will love this and people will hate it. Fair enough. It's badly packaged, the track listing on the cover is a shambles and the cover itself won't win any prizes. Fair enough. <br />Just don't be fooled by some of the previous reviews. The sound quality is stunning, far better than 75-85 and Plugged, there's plenty of old stuff, plenty of new stuff, the band are probably at the height of their powers and Springsteen's voice just gets better.<br />Even if you've never seen the band or simply want a memento from the tour then buy it. Some of you will be disappointed, no doubt, but that's just the unfortunate burden of unrealistic expectations.
B000007T1M|5.0|This cd rocks ! first off System of a Down has got to be one of the most unique bands out there. Serj Tankian  is the best singer out there ,(besides Corey from slipknot) he can go from eerie shrieks, to soft singing to, deep growls. If you don't believe me listen to samples and see for yourself. best tracks are Sugar, Suggestions, Spiders, Peephole, CUBErt. I highly recommend this cd to any metal fan in general.<br />OPEN YOUR EYES.OPEN YOUR MOUTHS.CLOSE YOUR HANDS AND MAKE A FIST.
B000001FTJ|5.0|So far, this is my favorite Tom Waits album. His lyrics still deal with the less popular sides of the city which can be seen in movies such as Robert Altman's Short Cuts, Burkowski's Barfly or even the Coehn brother's The Big Lebowski. The material may sound like his earlier albums, but now Waits is getting into musical madness. The songs have a touch of the avant-garde musically, but it doesn't seem to be done to make a statement or be seen as artistic. The unique nature of the music perfectly compliments the subject material of the songs. A great album any music fan should own.<br />Shore Leave is one of Tom Waits best songs.
0553573403|4.0|First, why 4 and not 5 stars?  In my opinion there are only are very few true 5 star books out there, so 4 stars is about as good as it gets for me.<br />There are enough reviews here praising the book, so I will not rehash, I will however try to rebut some of the negative comments posted.<br />This book has some harsh realities in it: graphic violence, rape, incest, sex, torture, slavery, etc.  I am not going to deny it, so if you cannot handle this type of a book, get Harry Potter.  Anyone here who thinks that Martin is sick, or twisted for including this type of stuff in his book, needs to check out their history and realize the reality of what feudal life was, and the reality of what close quarters, medi-evil combat was like.  These are real characters, acting the way real characters act.<br />This book is a breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre, where others have fallen back to rewriting the basic plot of &quot;Big,Bad,Evil God vs. good guy, underdog/peasent, boy/girl&quot;. Martin; from the word go tells you this is not going to be like any fantasy series you have read before.
0792839129|4.0|...the same author who gave the world Agent James Bond 007 is also the author of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;? Well, it's true the original book was indeed written by Ian Fleming, Mr.Bond's chronicler. I have to say, the movie version is a bit more fun than the original, and I hardly if ever hold such an opinion. I'm sort of a purist, in that I believe the original book is better than the movie, the reason being the book tells it like it &quot;really&quot; happened without the cinematic liscence(sp?) the movies invariably add. Be that as it may, I recommend both the book and the video with the added advantage that the book includes a recipe for fudge (pronouned &quot;fooj&quot;) made by one of the book characters. Too bad the movie doesn't offer Prof. Potts' recipe for his toot sweets. I'd buy them!
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club By Amy Tan<br /> The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan is no doubt, one of the most enchanting American-Chinese books I have ever read. It was written based on some of the old Chinese history and traditions, traveling through a time line from the early 1900s to the 1990s. It tells the story of four mothers and their daughters. Each story describes the lives of the mothers and how their histories made impacts on their daughters. Every one of them is different, some are heart wrenching, bringing me to the verge of tears, some of them are more optimistic, and definitely inspirational.  Amy Tan clearly portrayed differences in the mothers and their daughters in their opinions and perceptions of the things, drawing a well-defined line between the old traditional Chinese beliefs and the modern first generation American concepts. Yet, amidst these differences, little similarities were slowly revealed. She made use of certain events to draw the parallels in the mother-daughter relationships, and little symbolic metaphors that sum up each story. Little things that hide behind the big events slowly uncover themselves each time I read this book. Although this is an American Chinese book, it would definitely still be interesting for other races to find out more about the Chinese culture and to understand its traditions better. This is indeed Asian-American literature at its best and I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone.<br />-
0792846303|5.0|I strongly recommend this one, if you love horror &amp; spook stuff as much as I do you'll love &quot;The Fog&quot;. John Carpenter is a master director of horror movies, starting with his now-classic &quot;Halloween&quot;. One of his best movies is &quot;They Live&quot; which has the added distinction of starring former wrestling star Rowdy Roddy Piper, who has since become much less rowdy.If you liked the &quot;Illuminati&quot; novels and spin-offs, this movie about alien ghouls controlling the world through subliminal messages will be just your cup of Heinlien-esque tea. I have no guess if Carpenter was inspired by Robert A.Heinlein's novel &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;, which has already been made into a separate movie, but the main concept matches. And some critcs gripe about how Shakespeare already did it all and whatever followed was just a re-telling of his works. Well, my opinion is; sometimes once is indeed not enough. Thank you Mr.Carpenter for the entertainment you've given, please keep up the great job! And reading back over this, it suddenly occurs to me I have rather widely digressed from the main jubject which is &quot;The Fog&quot;. Go ahead rent it or buy it, remember...make sure ALL the doors and windows are locked tight and don't turn off your lights and especially DON'T go outside!!
B00005B6C9|5.0|The Bee Gees have done it again with their latest album &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;. Every song is sounds different from the next. It is quite amazing. You feel like you travel through time due to it's complex use of sounds, some used maybe 40 or 50 years ago (As is the case with &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;). There are great ballads, use of the electrical guitar in some songs, and even some modern dance songs (as is the case with &quot;Embrace&quot;). The title track is awesome and other standouts for me include &quot;She Keeps on Coming&quot;, &quot;Sacred Trust&quot;, &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, &quot;Man In The Middle&quot;, &amp; &quot;Walking on Air&quot;. Actually, as you can see it is really hard to pick standouts because I love them all. One thing also to mention is how Robin sings much more on this album than any other previous Bee Gees Albums. Maurice also sings alot too. It was quite interesting to hear not all of the songs being headed by Barry Gibb. You will love it... Bee Gees fan or not!
B00004YYDI|5.0|Wow, is all I can really say, words can't really describe the greatness of this movie. A friend of mine lent me the DVD, I was busy at the time so it sat on my rack for a week or so. One evening when I was bored I decided to watch a few movies. Seven, being the first movie I watched was great. Still in the movie mood, being a little skeptical at first I decided to try The Professional. When the movie played and the title 'Leon' appeared I thought I might of had to the wrong movie, but it turns out this was the title for the movie everywhere but in the US, so I continued watching. I won't completely give this movie away if you're reading this and haven't watched it yet, I'll just write about what you can basically see in the trailer.<br />Jean Reno plays Leon, a 'cleaner' who is truly a professional at what he does, killing people.  Natalie Portman in her film debut plays Mathilda, a 12-year streetwise girl beyond her years.  Gary Oldman plays Norman Stansfield (Stan), a heartless corrupt DEA agent who can probably range into the 'insane' category, he is truly a psycho. Danny Aiello plays Tony, a mob boss that handles all of Leon's 'business', also holds Leon's money and Leon's only friend (until he meets Mathilda).....<br />The acting in this movie is truly brillant. Jean Reno does a superb job playing Leon in every aspect of his character. Gary Oldman does a terrific job playing the big bad corrupt DEA agent. Danny Aiello does a great job playing Tony. But the one who really steals the show has to be Natalie Portman. Being only 12 years old, her acting in this movie is truly amazing. She makes it look so natural, especially the scenes in the movie that are very emotional. I can't imagine anyone that could play the role of Mathilda any better then she did. .... The musical score in this movie is definately one of a kind. Eric Serra is able to put the perfect (yes, perfect) music together with the scenes, making the emotional scenes have a much larger impact on the viewers. Listening to the soundtrack is amazing because the movie plays back in your mind as you're listening to the music having the same emotional impact as if you were watching the movie. Last but certainally not least is the director, Luc Besson. I've never even heard of Luc Besson (he directed the Fifth Element which I have seen but didn't know he directed it) until I saw this movie. Words can't even describe how he did on this movie. His style of will certainally be admired for along time. The camera work (he's his own camera man) in this movie, is, for lack of a better word, amazing. This is definately one of the best movies I've ever seen (and I've seen many movies), this film will remembered for along time. What troubles me though is the fact that the US version of the film had 24-minutes of the footage edited out. After reading what scenes were taken out, I couldn't believe it. The scenes that were taken out add depth and add to the impact of the movie. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have loved this movie as much if I would of seen the US version with all that critical footage taken out. I wish of give this movie more than 5 stars.
B000005H40|5.0|I believe Blue Train is in the top 3 coltrane recordings ever. He works well with the amazing quintet behind him, each has something uniqe to say and power colratne to higher levels. If you are a Jazz fan this record is a must have.
B00000637V|5.0|two things undermine 'berlin', the first being the fact that it's unrelentingly depressing; to be appreciated fully one has to be hitting an all-time low, it is then that listening to this makes complete sense and is truly rewarding; the other thing is the music, especially in the first part, the bombastic arrangements work against it; 'berlin' works best in the second half, particularly songs like 'caroline says II' and 'the kids', which are sparsely arranged and cut to te bone, but 'sad song' on the other hand is simply swapmed by all the instruments somethering it, the same goes for 'lady day' and 'caroline says I'; ultimately it's unfortunate as the songs are hauntingly beautiful, the second caroline being among the saddest songs ever recorded and 'the kids' certainly one of the most disconcerting; reed is chillingly resigned in his singing, the crucial line being 'me, i just don' care at all'; it would translate into next year's 'sally can't dance' album when the resignation turned into outright hate, the key line on that album being 'isn't it nice/when your heart is made out of ice'; so, perhaps it's no wonder that this bombed when it came out in 1973, it's just too much of a bummer to be enyjoed and listened to frequently, although it is a genuinely impressive collection of songs; highlights: 'caroline says II', 'the kids', 'oh jim'
B00000JPHE|4.0|Like many of you, I have seen this film many times, both in theaters, t.v. and home video. While the 'original' Dracula was always a favorite of mine, I would never consider it all that great of a movie.<br />The Phil Glass score has given this film new life.  It's almost like seeing the movie for the first time.
6304711905|5.0|AMAZING!... The most quotable film on this around (&quot;Why Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave.&quot;) The characters are totally believable. The casting is flawless. Romance AND action (so it is perfect for HIM or HER). Plus Robert Mitchum narrates. A Modern classic.
B0000028UK|4.0|An album of which much credit is due. This album has one of the best songs ever written: &quot;rearviewmirror&quot;. It beats out any rock song by far, and I don't see much others that could come close either. Vs. is a great album, although a little stereotypical sometimes (Animal, although good, is sort of monotonous). Still a strong album. Good job, PJ.
0790729644|5.0|Possibly Eastwood's best role (and with Good the Bad and the Ugly, White Hunter/Black Heart and Josey Wales under his belt, that says something). This film has been called the Gun-control-western. It is sharp, gritty and dirty... killingis horrible and at no point glorified, but shown as painful and desperate... <br />It is the story of a man... a good man, a bad man... a man... which really says a loyt, because so few people are willing to make a movie that shows the truth about us all.
031286504X|5.0|I am astonished at the fact that this novel recieved any bad reviews.  I can understand the fact that some readers felt cheated by the fact that the book included short stories after the novel, but this was simply an added bonus for any Matheson fans.  Enough about other ratings, now I'll explain why I feel the book deserves five stars.<br />The idea of the book alone is enough to make you try reading it.  A plague has turned the Earth's humans into vampires, and there is only one man left.<br />After hearing this idea some readers may be thinking that it sounds silly, or has been done before, but belive me; nothing like this has ever been done before.  For many vampire novels, the author simply gives the vampires the traditional powers and weaknesses, (crosses, garlic, etc.) but Richard Matheson goes so far as to explain why all this is true.  The explanations he gives, though they may seem far-fetched, are extremely plausible when Matheson describes them.  It seems as if Matheson did a lot of scientific research for this novel, because his explanations of DNA are terrific.<br />Finally, don't read this novel if you're just looking for a normal horror novel.  Read it if you're looking for an intelligent, suspenseful tale of a world overtaken by vampires.
0930289234|5.0|The title of my review is presumptuous and probably unwarrented, but I feel that every person on earth should read this book and then... then all the false, callow, poor authors who look down at illustrated writing can go hang themselves in shame.<br />The Watchmen is a Novel in 12 parts. It is a mystery, a story within a story and so many more things than I can say... From the murder of a murderer to the zen realization that their are no happy endings because nothing ends...<br />If you find the idea even mildly intriguing, buy this book... now... today... read and re-read it till the pages fall apart. Graciously give it to everyone you know... and the tell them to buy a copy and do the same.<br />That's what books are for afterall.
630575067X|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  I loved this movie - I saw it five times in the theaters.  But the one thing that really bothered me was the character of Jar Jar.  I realize the movie was intended for a younger audience than has become Star Wars' following...but Jar Jar was too much with his silly pig latin talk and just plain stupidity.  I didn't think he added to the plot at all.<br />What I was very impressed with was the end, how there were so many things going on at once (three? four? different large events) and they were all followable and linked and made sense.  I also thought the casting was fantastic.  Ewan McGregor made a totally believeable young Obi-Wan, and while we obviously had never met an older Qui-Gonn Jinn, Liam Neeson was wonderful in the role he played.  And little Jake Lloyd had the perfect look for Anakin; young, innocent, charming, but with a quiet intelligence and intensity that spoke volumes of his abilities.<br />Did anyone else find the explanation for the Metichlorians (sp) to be rather trivial and silly?  I really didn't like it at all. I'd tend to think of the Force as being something metaphysical - not something you can quantify by taking a blood sample.  That and Jar Jar were my main complaints.  Other than that, what a FANTASTIC movie!  Have four years passed yet????
6304806418|4.0|It was Xmas 1996. I was sitting at the premiere of Evita. It started and I cried. My companion was uncomfortable(&quot;Is he going 2be like t h a t  for the rest of the movie?????) However, I expected something a`la CABARET(1972) and then found myselfwatching - at times - a music video.  I found the libretto - at times mind u - 2 much for the music. And the stars? Well, OK, but it was just a piece of walking though a parade. Not ACTING in any sense. However, before it was finished, I started2likewhat I saw and have since held Madonna in great respect.  It was great on DVD(no - this is not a cinema film only) and when u buy the the premises - it is good entertainmment. It is important that it was virtally the only musical from Hollywood in the 90s(with Paramount`s Liza Minnelli vehicle Stepping Out 1991) and it is a shame that it didn`t revive the musical genre.
0790731983|5.0|CABARET has never looked better, remastered for it's 25th anniversary, with additional features.<br />Liza Minnelli gives the performance of her career as the singer Sally Bowles, on a self-imposed exile in Berlin, entertaining at the seedy Kit Kat Klub.<br />Into her life comes Brian Roberts (Michael York), a mild-mannered English bisexual who falls in love with her.  Both are seduced by the wealthy Maximillian (Helmut Griem) before Sally falls pregnant, aborts the child and Brian leaves Berlin just as the Nazi's gain power.<br />The musical, set against the stormy backdrop of Berlin in the 1930's, is a marvellous piece of film making.  Directed and choreographed by maestro Bob Fosse, CABARET also boasts original Broadway performer Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies, and Fritz Wepper and Marisa Berenson.<br />Also includes reminiscences by Liza Minnelli, Joel Grey, Michael York, Cy Feuer, John Kander and others from the creative team, an old featurette on the making of the film, and the original theatrical trailer.
6303407188|5.0|The reason I saw ED WOOD was because of Johnny Depp. I like his careerchoices(Benny and Joon, Dead Man, Nick of Time, Don Juan deMarco - though not from 1997 and on). ED WOOD is a magical piece of moviemaking - a beautiful motion picture fable about a man who made motion picture trash. The production design, performances etc make this an all-time classic.
B000007PI9|3.0|I always enjoy watching this for about 20 minutes at a time.  But after that it starts to get a little bit boring.  And it doesn't matter at which point you come into the film.  It has some very funny lines and plenty of macho for those of us who like that but after the initial viewing the film loses some of it's appeal.  <br />A souped up cruiser.  A renegade cop.  Some square policemen.  Throw in a few bad guys and a pretty girl you've got most of the films made for guys in the last 20 years.<br />So it's definitely enjoyable but not all that great.
6302642256|5.0|Is a very good movie to watch with the whole family, you will be laughing and maybe a little crying. My 9 year old loves to watch the movie over and over again and again. We have been searching for the soundtrack, he would like to listen to it in his bedroom. Over all the movie is excellent.
6305776369|4.0|If you'd ask me i'd tell you, I hate this film and it sucks. That's a lie a big lie at first I hated this film then I bought the DVD at blockbuster video (wow what a differance). But the second time I watched I found something differt wierd a film I hated I saw myself laughing at it,laughing hard having a real good time. Then I look at th crystal clear picture witch was excellent. The sound is Immpecable it's not Mallrats but it's still very funny.
0141000198|5.0|I love this book not only because it really captures the life crisis that errupts in every late 20s/early 30s person, but it teaches you so much about the interesting aspects of contemporary English culture. This is something far from the Dickenisian world we usually envision, but a fast-paced new business world of intellectuals and modern women. You'll learn so much about the UK culture you'll want to visit.
B00004XPP0|1.0|Don't take this wrong, this is one of the best set of movies ever put out.  So why isn't there a DVD.  These movies are to good to only have a VHS format.  Don't buy this until George Lucas quits being greedy and releases it on DVD.
0385335482|5.0|I admit, I hate reading and rarely do it outside of school.  But this was a book I couldn't put down. When I saw the title flashing at me from the isle of Target, I couldn't resist but to pick it up and check it out.  And from the first line, I was hooked.  I felt like someone took all my thoughts about not only shopping, but life in general, and put them to print.  It's amazing the connection the author made with me.  It's a modern, hip, perky read that all women need to read!  Confessions of a Shopaholic was the best fiction book I've ever read!!
B000002LGA|5.0|I had heard \\"Walk On the Wild Side\\" with my father as a child, and although there were lyrics there at the time I didn't fully understand, the song made a significant impact.  I saw \\"New York\\" in a record (there were still a few) store when it was released and decided to buy it (I was 12).  This album touched me then, as it does now.  In different ways, to be sure.  I have matured and can understand more fully the depth of this music I could only bearly appreciate as a younger boy.  Where has this kind of heart-felt, lyric rich, desperate yet hopeful music gone?  Very few musicians, or people in general, obtain a mastery of language as Lou Reed has.  His ability to convey thought and emotion while both telling a story and making a commentary on the Human Condition is awe inspiring and motivating.  When I have lost hope in Humankind I put on Lou Reed.  I would give my right arm to make art like this.  This is what redeems us all.
