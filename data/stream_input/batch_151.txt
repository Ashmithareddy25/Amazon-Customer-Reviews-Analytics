B001AWJ6J8|5|Good price and they fit great.
B00AKYOZDY|4|genuine article, but a bit pricy
B00P5NHJWY|4|Got a few small air bumps under sticker :(
B00EPDKSO6|5|Great fit!!
B005G5R5LQ|5|Great product
B000WJFSWO|5|Awesome fender looks good fits Good.
B00P05CJ54|4|Yes worked well ran it for a 52&#34; light bar .
B00AHJFN1K|5|Purchased these for my 2012 Sonata and couldn't be happier.  I paired these with a set of Redstuff brake pads and I haven't heard a squeak or squeal since I put them on.  Straight from the package they look high-quality welded and machined.  I've only had them on there for a week now, so I can't comment yet as to how they will stand the test of time but all looks promising.
B008213AU6|5|Great fit.  &#34;BUT&#34; the instructions were in &#34;SPANISH&#34; and not english.  Had to install it the hard way (assembled it first, then made the measurements).
B000C16XJO|5|99 Jeep Grand Cherokee left front, driver side. This product is easy to install and fit perfectly to the original holes, no need to drill any extra holes. It's a plus to have a few clips come with it to replace old and broken one when taking out door panel. Good job Dorman!
B0002UEOPA|5|Will disolve/clean with gasoline. Very durable and everything proof
B006FYJBUA|5|excellent
B00ZV9UCXU|5|Great product. I love it.
B00HESPG9Q|5|We have a Grand Design Reflection 323BHS and my 8 year old son was having a hard time reaching the top bunk, this ladder solved the problem.  Well constructed and serves its purpose.
B00IXW0H3W|5|Quality Allison filter easy to install fast shipping
B00IZZDRR0|5|Very sturdy and a safe step for my mom when she gets into the van. Just a bit heavy, but it's ok since the step remains in the vehicle and I'm not lugging it around.
B00F9RNIPI|5|They work.
B00LBAC12S|5|LOVE THIS.  Definitely helps with long trips + sun.  Drops the degrees in the jeep as well.  Sun still radiates through, but not too harshly with long drives.
B004D6H6JK|5|great  sounding solid exhaust
B001V9V152|4|It ended up being just too big to go on the back of my truck window, so I gave it away.  It looked like good quality though.
B00M9LXHV2|5|There great looks awesome in my softail deluxe thanks
B00M468ZSC|3|Attractive but no more room than my old one.
B001RNOHBC|2|Crapped out on 2nd use. Couldn't charge a phone or a properly run a 120v device.
B00K3QAQJQ|4|Didn't fit perfect on my 2004 Tundra but it was because of tight clearances not the tool.
B00I87FACU|5|good item
B001EA0LZ4|5|A
B004133C20|5|Great item and deal
B00GJ1HUB6|3|Power wire keep falling off different connections
B004RCT19I|5|Exact fit. Works well and easy to instal
B001LA195S|5|great!
B00OPZGTBK|3|More instructions on what is needed to install should be provided.
B00844UB62|5|most secure way to haul your bike when necessary, I outfitted my whole trailer with them, I have 4.
B00V5QUWMO|5|Worked great very satisfied
B00FF9AKKQ|5|Good fit!
B005DZJ7VA|5|My husband was very impressed!
B004BCHOVG|3|need to be sealed with silicon around edges to prevent water
B0000AY3X0|5|It absorbs water, 10/10 would squeegee again.
B00PX6DV84|4|I purchased these for my 2013 Ford Escape. And while they are cheap I was able to get them on relatively easily. Yes they do have a slight chemical order which I'm sure will dissipate and yes they feel cheap but for what you pay for them I feel they do the job adequately.
B0009IQXFO|5|A++
B000182EUU|5|good quality
B003GZ8GXY|5|Very fast shipping, overall good purchase
B001A0F88I|5|UPDATE: purchased 7/2015 and still going strong! Work great and no rust/issues/problems!  I installed them on a 1998 F-150 and they don't fit completely in the space left when you remove the stake pocket cover. Close, but not perfect. This doesn't affect their function at all. This is a work truck and form follows function in my world, but if you've got one of those parking lot warrior show trucks this might be an issue for you. There is also a nice detail under the ring when you lift it up. A Christian fish symbol. I like that little Easter egg.
B000VJPHKS|5|Great sound and more power from my 08 klx450r. Fit perfect
B00X421IDO|5|This is what this scooter needed, Thanks.
B00BMDZLH6|4|Letter are fairly good weight metal and mounted to clear &#34;mounting&#34; tape.  Would be very easy to install.  Unfortunately was folded in half twice to be shipped in a small envelope, so some of the letters came off the tape & stuck to the bag.  Would never stick to the vehicle now.
B00JLVHY4Y|5|I absolutely LOVE these mats. I know a lot of companies advertise floor mats that fit in a variety of cars, but it is well worth the money to get these made specifically for your Honda Fit (or for whatever other Honda car you may drive). They have made my life so much easier than having to constantly worry about anything getting on the interior carpet. Each weekend, I simply remove the mats, shake them out, and put them back in, and my car always looks like it is fresh from the dealership. I would recommend these over mats from any other outside manufacturer. Also, if you have a Costco membership, you get all accessories for 50% off, which makes them a steal!
B00MF4CMJG|5|these fairings are amazing in every way shape and form. they look beautiful and went together than my old suzuki oem fairings. the wind visor i got was for a ninja zx6r tho. with how great they look that didn't even bother me
B00DCFSAKC|5|prefect price, legit product, fits on stock and aftermarket cats/headers and exhausts, you can feel the difference in response and acceleration, and SHINY
B0002MBBIQ|5|Best thing you could do to your truck.
B0080E4AEK|5|Top of the line.
B003YJGYPO|5|the product meet my expectation and looks good
B000NJ1HIW|5|Really well made vest. Like it a lot.
B00HSHWBGY|4|Recently purchased this LED kit for my 3 series; i received all items listed and they all worked. Installation was fairly simple but removing the factor bulbs was a bitch. Good product, highly recommend.
B00556KXVK|5|Great product, shipping and price were fantastic. Highly recommended
B00379ABX2|1|Clearly the cheapest product that I've ever purchased online. The original manufacturer's UPC barcode sticks out like a sore thumb on the bottom front right-hand corner, not shown in the photo depiction. The seller tried to cover it up with their own stick-on label. This is something that Walmart would sell for a couple of dollars.Unless you using as a prank, don't but this piece of junk.
B00HLTN8FW|5|Looks absolutely beautiful
B0006IX878|4|Did its job
B009YHUUXM|5|Love it. Will purchase from seller again.
B000GVOD1U|5|They're yellow
B0030V6XW0|5|polished my brass and chrome fixtures in my home...they sparkle now!
B003SWNVI0|2|We bought this for a move from California to New Jersey. I was impressed at how much this bag holds. So much room and a great price. We had high hopes but in the end we were disappointed. Yes it helped us transport everything to our new home and saved us money but we drove through several big storms the whole way. The end result was wet stinky soggy suitcases and boxes filled with our belongings. We had to throw away any books or papers that were in their. Their was literally a big puddle of water inside the bag when we took it down. If you waterproof everything in the bag it wouldn't be bad but if you are looking for something that will keep everything dry I'd look so please else. I would not buy this same bag again.
B002MPVGKY|5|Wonderful product, easy to handle, our pet uses it with ease and it saves our backs!
B008RIEQXY|5|Nice and bright, and easily installed.  Excellent value.
B006K8YQYW|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Great delivery time.
B008Y8UDNO|5|worked fantastic...... put in a 2000 Impala. Permanent fix.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|“I received the tire gauge yesterday,8/4. I immediately compared its accuracy with a long trusted gauge I have had for years. Its accuracy was spot on. I like the heft of the Jaco gauge and the grip of the rubber wrap. The Amazon price was a bargain and this gauge will find a home in the glove box of my muscle car.”
B000BZGKCG|5|Fit my 83' RX-7 and seems to be well above average in quality
B00BARY7D8|3|Get what you pay for
B00XZCGZQ8|3|Jacket fits good looks nice and can be seen in the daytime. However the piping on the jacket I got is not reflective like it says in the product description not good for night riding, The armor feels like cheap cardboard and I'm not confident it will protect me like my Joe Rocket jacket armor would ,You get what you pay for is true in this case.
B0037LKX3I|1|Just got them and right off the bat you can tell they are not LEDs. You can see an incandescent bulb right inside the housing. False advertising. Problem is I need them for this weekend so I can't turn around and send them back. Looks like I'm stuck with these.
B000COTX34|5|Works great
B001G3Q414|5|it works good
B004SL85RW|1|This is 10W30 oil! Why use the 5W30 picture? It is misleading.
B000C57W36|5|You will have to install the grease fitting and the hole is not threaded. Not much trouble to use the fitting to cut the threads but getting it started can make you say some new words. The ball/head is larger than OEM but the tapper shank is direct fit, this must be a problem they solved (hints problem solver). The larger ball must provide more surface and some other stuff, just remember to pack it with grease after installing it.<br />If you are doing what I did and bought Tie Rod End boots to replace the rubber style with poly then you need to get these and measure first. Energy Suspension part 9.13102R does not fit. Even though they would fit my OEM rods.
B0048E95XC|5|They fit the car perfectly and look nice as well.
B009XH4FJS|2|It completely fell apart pretty quickly.  I was able to reassemble it and used Loctite glue to keep it together.  It's pretty, though.
B0013HV3M8|5|It was perfect!!! MOPAR OEM. Easy to install and looks great!!!  Amazon is ALWAYS my &#34;Go To&#34; supplier for everything !!!
B008HIW424|5|:) Proud of these
B000NOO798|1|Fallowed all instructions product did not work.
B00OP4JVU2|5|Awesome piece, looks great on my Road King along with the matching horn cover and air cleaner insert.
B0038F8SYE|5|Great stool
B0033WDEN2|5|Installation went well, only  took 1 1/2 hours to install on my 2010 Ford Taurus.  Very pleased and was delivered within 2 days.
B005R66BQ4|4|Worked very well on my 2005 Hyundai Elantra. The size c fits pretty good, much better than the slip on steering wheel covers that I have had in the past. Takes a couple hours, but is most definately worth the time. Makes my car feel new again.Fits almost as well as the Honda stitch on i bought for my Accord, i wish i would have found this first, much better value for the money.
B00H888XRY|5|I love the sticker! It is the typical &#34;I haven't done anything to my car but have a cool sticker&#34;
B000N4UQL6|5|Very nice.  Heavy duty, quality. It's been bouncing around in the back of my camper for a few years now and has held up well.  Used it a couple times without issues.  I recommend this because it a strong, durable no BS battery jumper with large, simple controls and display.  Most have stupid lights and gimmicky stuff that you don't need.
B000EQ97VS|5|Works as expected and cheap.
B003VASR9C|5|no problem install
B008USDJZC|5|Fit perfect
B00VVFGIXG|5|a+
B00401CJ8G|5|Easy to install. Good fit.
B00DDYNUC0|5|It fit great
B0041TS6UM|5|Overall it was exactly what I needed. The dealership wanted to charge me $400 for a replacement.  I installed it myself in about 5 minutes, saved around $350.  Looks great.
B00V9T0HZ4|3|I bought this product cause it fit my tundra rail system for my year cause thule stopped making the adapter for that year 2014 cause I would have went with thule. This product is a decent one for the price but didn't like a few things. Shipping was horrible something where lost and some where damaged and the box was not that strong for the product it had to hold. I had no instructions it was a mess. The black cotting on the bars comes of easy and looks cheap. All said and done once put together after everything was replaces and some fixed by me. The rola is strong and feels very sturdy. It's a one level hight not adjustable very easy to put together. Would I recommend this?? yes. Price is good quality is sturdy and strong looks ok but it should be better boxed and I highly recommend that it is or this product will get poor reviews if it doesn't cause first when a box gets shipped badly my first guess is that you will go through what I did and that is already a bad taste.
B004GF7PL2|5|Works great. Easy to install and makes a huge difference over the old ones.
B0035B013W|5|this is so cute
B001QUUTWM|5|Excellent
B0013LUBSG|2|The tape is supposed to attach to fabric on the inside of the door channel and it does not stick. this causes the ventshade to slide down and keep the window from closing.
B00JN0U4SQ|5|love it
B008VPYYRG|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Wrangler TJ
B00HV1VBG8|5|Same as the front easy to install
B00GJZ3A20|5|Very good
B00FS0VINU|5|Great quality and value for a hard to find item
B00AKYP15A|5|good
B001KSCSQU|5|Fit my 2007 Chevy Silverado 5.3 e85. It takes 5 minutes too swap it out.
B00GFYDJMG|3|I bought this because it said it would fit my 1986 Suzuki lt250r and it's not even close. The stock one was about an inch longer so not only will it not mount onto the frame, the little clip inside the boot that clips onto the spark plug isn't big enough to go on my spark plug. However it is a perfect match for my 1990 Honda XR100 so I'm keeping it for a spare for that
B007HSZILE|5|awesome!
B00KI7R62U|5|Nice Decals!
B00GHT6COQ|1|Solved &#34;clicking&#34; noise under dash, a common fault of Ford Climate Controls. EDIT: VERY SHORT LIFE SPAN, LAST ONE LASTED 6 WEEKS! How do I get the Dorman lifetime warranty?
B00KTJ2T7E|5|Improved performance and gas mileage. Perfect fit.
B00OF2UU8Q|5|Purchased this for 16 year old's first truck.  It attached easily & was a great inexpensive fix.
B00X516QQ8|5|super comfortable and has pretty good wind reduction very light and does not catch much wind
B000FGI34E|5|A noticeable acceleration and deeper rumble on my 2012 Scion tC.  Added about 3 MpG and I accelerate quicker??? It's a no brainer...try this for awhile, then buy a K&N Typhoon Cold Air Intake...that's what I did.
B0031P6OYW|5|easy installation, quality replacement
B00GMQ37II|5|Works great
B006IIOAYA|5|Doesn't glow in the dark (who cares)  Easy to read and fit great
B003AODN20|5|Good products, do as expected.  Will buy again
B009X1X78O|3|This is your common Chinese coil that's used on go Karts , ATV's, dirt bikes ...  the part that seems to go bad is the actual  spark plug boot ..it's made of plastic  and not rubber like the American counter part ..over time the heat from the engine  tends to Crack the boot .. if you have to replace these because  of this reasoning  you can do what I did and change  the boot end over to a American  style , you will need cable strippers , rubber spark plug boot ,metal clip for spark plug ,  brass screw on sparkplug conector.  .. also I don't know why this is called high performance  because  it's the same as the coils that come from the factory  ...
B000NBWCFC|5|Good product
B00JBI9AUI|1|Gave one star and I feel cheated because I can't give it 0. These don't plug and play with any American made Cruze. The wiring on the lights are very different and little. These come from Taiwan but I got headlights from the same company and origin and they went in fine.
B009D2VER4|4|Great artwork to bad the helmet sits very high on your head!
B00TSQCD7K|5|As advertised, look great on my car.
B001EWPIIW|1|Does not fit 2004-2007 armadas
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Well built and bright, I would compare the brightness to a good pair of car headlights. I purchased for an ATV and they are far brighter than the factory lights.
B008WTO0G6|4|I love it.
B008VOLLKA|3|ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!! But...when driving highway speeds the attached &#34;hips&#34;, fighting with the wind speeds, really bend the antenna which concerns me.  I will not return them because they are so cute but I think I will cut down the hips in an attempt to cut down on the bending issue.
B00UVBB32C|1|This thing needs work.  There isn't sufficient contrast to read the temperature, the quoted battery type is not what came in the unit and they don't work without modification to the battery cover (followed with unnecessary force to close it).
B00BF0W34U|5|totally pleased with this product
B009BFPT8I|3|It appears to be a good product but it is very hard to program. After first trip I will have to try to reprogram it because the high and low pressure readings are not right.
B008BYQC6I|4|used as a drop in replacement for 2000lb winch I took off a 2001 Polaris sportsman 500 ho. This new style looks to be sealed up well.the old one got water inside ruined the brush end.the holes needed to be drilled a little larger on the mounting plate , as they were off a small amount
B0050Z9QBY|2|Made a mistake buying this type of product. I wanted to have some brighter lights, and a friend referred me to these lights. The package came fast, but one of the lights already looked damaged as if it was already used. I bought an antiflicker and computer warning to see if it would negate the effects, but it didn't. Within 2 weeks of installing, one light burned out and the other was flickering. Their customer service is horrible too, I was put on hold for nearly an hour before being helped.
B003BZR8LA|1|too bulky
B0013T7OL0|5|Love them.
B00681BDXI|5|Programmed on first try. Daughter loves it.
B003GXMJG6|5|Was a great buy
B00A29F180|5|This is such a cute set!!! And everything is so soft!
B00H1NI8GC|5|Works well.  Sturdy.  Wife loves it for the back of her Honda HR-V
B00SA3TGOK|4|oil temp lost bout 20*, would have liked to have instructions with torque specsotherwise seems to be a good unit
B007J0V7MO|5|used and still running
B004HCOE8Q|5|good
B0087GRB1K|1|Did not fit my new headers. O2 sensor placement in a bad spot.
B0013RKEP0|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B000E7YP7I|5|love it!
B000CSWM5G|1|bought this product for a 1953 f100 I am restoring. I have replaced everything from tank to carb so everything is clean and free of old stail gas. I put carb on and it fired up a couple times then wouldnt fire. I was getting gas to the carb but not thru the carb. I put on my old holley the motor came with and truck ran perfect. further inspecting the carb I started noticing a a sludge like substance. Looking further into it I took top plate off and the carb is dirty and full of old gas residue. I did not run truck long enough to have it look like this and the gas I am using  I bought that day and checked to see from leftover in the can and it is clean good gas... At this point I am very disapointed... This is probably why there is only a 30 day return policy on this product.... I dont even want to give it the one star I did give it...
B0009JKGJW|5|Good price for a quality product with prompt delivery. Will buy from them again.
B00P7VVIS0|2|This net does not have enough tension for it to be really useful in holding anything down but the largest object. Even with large boxes, the net remains too loose.<br />Look for an alternative for a rear cargo net.
B00S87A4SU|4|they work great. very helpful to change door speaker and had to take off all door panels. one of tips did bend very easy and wasn't useful after that. but still a good buy.
B001NZZAGU|5|Item was perfect fit.
B000COCTXA|1|I installed these on my 2007 Mazda 3 today. They are awful. The jets spray down at the windshield wipers, and its more of a mist that a nice spray of water. Obviously these are adjustable, so I adjusted the angle using the nozzle adjusting tool that is included in the kit. I went through an entire reservoir of windshield washing fluid, and spent an hour trying to get the spray right... or even remotely acceptable. I finally had to give up.<br /><br />I wonder if BOTH of my nozzles were defective (it seems likely if it would be one of them... but they are both equally awful). I'm sort of mad because this was a waste of money, and I spent a little more to get this brand over the cheaper one offered on amazon.<br /><br />Don't buy.
B00DQO6IX0|5|Definitely takes longer than the 15 minuets the  instructions say....about 30 to 40 more minuets. As long as you follow the them you should have no problem installing this harness. When your installing the  comverter with  double-sided tape make sure you wipe down  the mating surfaces with alcohol to make sure everything is clean.
B00FFGYAB4|5|Perfect - exactly what I expected.
B00JPMQ53A|5|comes in handy and fits in console of car without takign up too much room
B000C2YXF4|5|Item fit was perfect, no problems since installed
B009S31VVW|5|I was hesitant to replace the interior door handle on my 2012 Ford Fusion, after having a difficult time with door panels on previous vehicles, but the door panel was actually very easy to disassemble. After removing a total for four bolts/screws, remove electronics, and carefully pry off the door panel. The plastic fasteners will require some effort to pull out, but it is unlikely that they will break. If they do break, you can easily replace them. The handle is held on with one bolt and is very easy to switch out. The new handle works great and I probably saved a few hundred dollars doing the repair myself.
B00PLIYNYK|5|Looks great at a great bargain
B000GBIQ36|5|This fixed an annoying problem easily and inexpensively.  I'm a happy driver now.  It was easy to install and matched the factory component perfectly.
B00U2R0XNA|5|Looks awesome in my truck!
B00BQN5SUW|4|They work perfect but be careful cause your trunk will fly up!
B01237AQSS|5|I love this product. It is small and lightweight and fits in my backpack without taking too much room. I wish that it came with tree straps but those are easy to obtain. Perfect for backyard, back packing, camping or to have in your bugoutbag. Easy to put up and take down and it all folds up into the pocket on the side. It is comfy too and if you need to you can fold it around you when you sleep, just get a couple clips and it is like a cocoon embracing you while you sleep. This will have a new permanent place in my backpack. Lightweight yet strong. I love that this one holds up to 600 lbs so I can be confident in its strength when my little guy wants to cuddle in the hammock with momma. Quality stitching and materials. Confident I will be able to get a lot of use out of this.I got one of each color.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This is my own opinion.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Absolutely PERFECT!<br />I have a &#34;Plum Crazy&#34; 2007 Dodge Daytona Charger with Black Interior. I had my windows tinted as dark as the law would allow. I live in Central Texas, where the past few summers, including this summer where the temperature has been over 100 every single day for weeks. The heat index is around 105 to 107. It is HOT!<br />When I get in my car, it is so hot I can't breathe. We roll all the windows down, turn on the air and not only does it take minutes to cool off, but the seats are so hot &#60;yep - leather&#62; they burn your booty. Not to mention making fried sausages out of your fingers on the steering wheel.<br />I saw this sun protector and purchased it immediately. With all the great reviews how could I not?!<br />This fits my windshield like a glove. Truly, it's like it was made for my car. There's no excess, it's not too small &#60;at all&#62;...it's *Perfect*!<br />It was 109 today with a heat index of 116. I had to go to a doctor appointment and was almost excited to get in my car. I was able to open up the car, get in without the use of my rescue inhaler, sit on my seats without burning the buns,  turn the car on and the air...no burned fingers/hands!! It took about a minute for the air to cool it off the rest of the way - and I was on my way.<br />It stores nicely when not in use..and is as light as a feather.<br />SO ~ I would not only HIGHLY recommend this sun protector to anyone looking to cut down the heat in their car, but I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more. In fact I'm getting one for my husband for his new truck.<br />I'm THRILLED with this purchase!!!
B001S2ZMSE|5|Right on time also great price
B00K25N514|4|Quality is good.  Finish and manufacturing quality is better than average.  Have not sued extensively yet so cannot give 5 stars.
B0009IBJAS|4|Seems to work fine-not industrial but for keeping the classic car in the garage charged up it's fine. Extension cable a nice plus, but is a plus-an extra charge
B000IYA3R8|5|Worked great!
B007OSL3DY|5|No more worrying about my tailgate getting stolen.
B008ZCEFM4|5|Installed
B0055EALW8|5|It doesn't say synthetic,  why some people are saying it's synthetic<br />?
B00BWBGB54|1|Supposed to be plug and play but its not
B001S80ZZI|5|The part worked great! Perfect fit for my truck.
B002JH7PEQ|4|I ordered this for my husband because he works out of our truck doing mortgage field service. He always need to charge his drill batteries, skill saw ect. and needed to be able to do that on the go. This thing works like a charm for him! It charges everything safe and efficiently. His own complaint with it is it quite large. It fits in our cup holder barely and is the size of a coffee thermos. I am guessing the design is necessary though to be able to charge everything on the go. Needless to say this Rally Cup Holder Power Inverter is a god send for him and we would order another one.
B00M9IJ9F8|5|Easy to install.  Pretty good protection. Be nice if it was two inches higher.  Not a big impact on top speed.  Maybe 3 mph.
B003DNJ728|4|Good quality
B007I8W992|5|👍🏼
B00DX8CEAU|5|look and feel awesome
B00NTU18KY|5|This product does what it says. It gives the reading nicely. I can't comment on the accuracy as I don't have anything else to compare it. However, it certainly does nicely show charging rate. I compared various combinations charging my iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, power bank with the 10W charger, 5W charger, laptop and the readings showed was around the ball park on what I expected. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a scientific way to measure the actual charging performance you have between various combinations of device, cable & charger.
B009DIWHJW|5|This fit my 2.5L Ranger, increased MPG and power. I can skip the tires moving from 2nd to 3rd, when I need to punch it.
B005CLP980|5|Great use and great size~
B000C9QEF4|5|Worked good nice that it's oem part thanks
B001KO0QD6|5|Arrived quickly just not for me. Giving 5 stars because it came on time and as described. I just don't care for it myself. You may love it though
B000FN2VX6|5|great service from america.<br /><br />arrived in England 3 days from ordering,<br />a garage totally wrecked all our wheel bearings, suspension wishbones, wheel sensors, and new driveshafts.<br />so we decided to order this with the hammer extension and joint fork adaptor for next time.<br /><br />it's a sturdy piece of kit and the adaptor fits nicely on a ford Mondeo driveshaft.<br />very happy with the purchase, and it was fun watching it travel from the USA to England,<br /><br />best delivery i have ever seen, and highly recommend this as a addition for the home mechanic.
B0006MRS5M|2|Found lettle use for the fittings in the package.
B00O29G5NG|5|It's a window shade. Love the color!
B000NVW1LM|5|I've had an oil leak in my 1997 Accord (EX-L coupe, 201,000 miles) for about a year and a half. I put about 10,000 highway miles per year on the car as it's my commuter vehicle. The leak's gotten worse over time, from not being an issue between oil changes to needing to add a quart every 500 miles or so. Now when I park the car at work I can see the drip path of oil to my car from where I enter the parking lot. Everywhere I park, when I leave there's a puddle of oil probably the size of a small dinner plate left behind. I'm pretty sure my rear main seal is going bad because that's where the oil is dripping from.<br /><br />I bought this stuff a couple of days ago because a $10 temporary fix is better than a $700 permanent fix on a car worth only about $1200. I added the entire bottle before my commute to work Wednesday morning (50 mile round trip). By the time I got back to work Thursday morning the drip was nowhere to be found! There were only a few drops of oil where I parked my car the night before, and no drops at all in the work parking lot this morning. I'll update this review as time goes on, but so far I'm a believer!
B00MIA1SEC|5|Looks awesome. You really need some elbow grease to tighten the screws. They will come loose on the brake pedal since its aggressively used. I took my rubber brake pedal cover off to get a good amount of strength to secure it in place. Also used the doubled sided foam tape. 05 Trailblazer
B000ECS8UI|3|I ordered the rear section exhaust for my 2001 Z06. The seller, or whoever, did not send brackets for the install or nuts and bolts. Unless you have a Z06 you will probably have to have custom brackets made for your base c5. For the Z's, there at sway bar has to be unbolted in order to remove the stock exhaust. This may seem like a hass but it'll help because you'll need to bolt the exhaust brackets there anyway. The install was simple and straight forward. If you don't want to sound like a motorboat shell out the extra cash and get an X pipe. You will not be disappointed. Also, buy some OEM flange gaskets while you're at it (you will only need two). I don't have the part number in front of me but do some research on the forums. Give yourself a full day for the install. I had a lift and it was still a little time consuming because of the package not having the needed hardware. But if you do decide to get this exhaust you will not be disappointed.
B00HHH1KJE|3|Not as bright as I would like, but not too bad.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Was a little tricky at first figuring out how to fold it up, but once I got that down, its a cinch to use.  Takes less than a minute to put it up and put it away.
B00VNBDOV2|5|This is brilliant.  Why bother with HID kits when you have to mount the ballast, and tuck all the wiring in?  These have a real nice beam pattern, works very will with projectors (well everything is better with projectors) and they are as bright as other 55watt hids, and even a tad brighter.  The beam pattern being so nice is what really shines on this product.  Not to mention, its simple to install, simply swap it with your old bulb and bam.<br /><br />You might want to zip tie any excess wiring, if there is any.<br /><br />DONT BE FOOLED, if you look at the 2 and 3 star reviews, they all say its not that bright or their HID's are better.  They are flat out wrong, or maybe in their specific case.  These bulbs are better in every way, they are brighter, last longer, turn on instantly, have a MUCH better patter, and the installation is much quicker and cleaner.  for 100 bux, theres no reason NOT to buy these, when you can get ripped on some $200+ HID kit with all of its draw backs.
B0000C6FOM|4|Did not mount them according to directions had to mount them under the frame of my boat trailer they seem to be fairly strong and so far have worked as as advertised
B00KVRIQ94|5|Works great. Looks better than the original. Just couldn't use the mounting bracket. Had to use old one.
B002IYJUES|3|ok for price
B00CD2RN94|5|I put these on my 2008 Toyota Tundra and they make it look so much better. It took me around 2-3 hours to remove my old fender flares and put the Lund flares on. I got them painted white to match my truck and if you don't get them painted I would recommend getting a clear protective coat on them just so they don't fade in the sun. It was $10 for me to get the protective coat after I got them painted.
B000KOTXSQ|3|Nothing spacial about this product, old design, hard to crank and slow moving also got rusted fast!!!
B002C3MIN0|5|part of my anti roll kit. like it
B00TR0FYRI|5|Great replacement, great brightness, straight forward replacement.
B00POME6ZE|4|Wonderful for all the snowy days and nights we have had.  Easy to use and love the bag to store it in.
B000A8RU46|5|I bought these to replace the mirrors on a 1989 Toyota 1/2 ton pickup. There were enough adjustment points to make them fit well and they are very sturdy. No more vibration.
B003ETM6VK|5|this product worked fine for me. make very sure all gasket surfaces are super clean and dry. also make sure the adapter plate is flat and completely level and be very careful when installing not to bend it, as it bends very easily. also be sure you have the correct oil pan to timing cover seal as chevy had two different designs and are not interchangeable. the 1/4 inch is for pre-1974 and the 3/8 inch is for newer ( then in 1985 it was changed again). best of all it fit under my short water pump simply by using double water pump gaskets. the oil pan to timing cover seal is very tight and with this design it is actually easier than installing a one piece cover. i used the grey permatex gasket maker as it is very fluid and remains soft when cured. it is impervious to oil and gasoline also. i found it helps to use ARP timing cover studs as they hold everything in place while installing. before tightening timing cover studs install the balancer so the timing cover will center properly ( install timing cover seal first ). i did not drop the oil pan.
B002LF7HHG|5|Looks great!  Easy application.
B0053ODFZU|5|Great fuel additive.  I always notice whenever I do use it, my gas mileage increases and my Mustang delivers more power during acceleration making my car funner to drive.  I've been using this one for years and it's always done wonders for my vehicles.
B000PEZ196|5|I've used this and another 3M sealant product on automotive seams and it nearly replicates the factory material (although I am not as neat!). Excellent product.
B00VTYXIR8|5|Prefect. As described. Quick swap.
B000CQ49X6|4|Better than average life, resists clogging, very uniform grain/particle deposition.
B00BV6XKK4|5|Much cheaper than OEM Gaskets (110 a pop usually that don't even come with the wires you'll probably need).  These parts fit without issue on my 1995 7.3 and the wires included are a lifesaver.  I can't express how much these saved me time and, more so, money.
B00S58V56W|5|Perfect fit.  Completes the car and doesn't allow anyone to see my purchases
B007TY8MZU|5|I ordered tail lights on a Tuesday night. I expected the arrival for the next week. I was surprised and ecstatic to see them on my door step as I was leaving for work on Thursday morning (I leave around 10:45 am). My cousin installed them the same day and I was able to get my inspection sticker (I had my old driver's taillight wastaped on which obviously failed the safety portion. The right side just had an annoying crack that water would get into). It may sound strange but I'm just really excited that I don't have to drive around with a taped up car and I can now go through an automatic car wash and not have to wash it by hand.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very big, fits great
B000GOHV3O|4|It works well so far.
B009DJUZAY|5|Fast service and love the product! 😍🙌🏾
B00EYBXV48|1|Didn't come with the double cardan inner u-joint... Cost an extra $140 to get one after the fact. Disappointed.
B005JPIMQU|5|I bought this for my husband to shine the rims on the road tractor at work and he says it works like a charm!! He said that his coworkers and boss both said that his truck looked awesome! I recommend this to anyone for polishing chrome a good investment by far!!
B00DJ7OGJW|3|The hose is pretty cheap I changed it out seems to work ok
B008032Q2E|5|Highly recommend! Product as promised and 1/4 the cost as local automotive stores.  Shipped on time.
B000XBBBAY|5|Operates on my Suzuki LTZ 250 perfectly
B002UC1AYQ|5|great replacement for the one on my camper that froze and broke
B005CLMYIS|4|I drive a 2002 Ford Ranger with umpteen gazillion miles. I snapped off my door handle during a really cold day this past winter. This replacement handle is a little cheapo-ish but it works and I was able to install this without too much trouble (okay, I got a couple of guys to help me but I'm not exactly mechanically inclined). I can actually get in and out of my vehicle. Success, people! It's the little things. I recommend this product.
B00GI2CBIS|5|I love this sunshade for my car. the design stands out and lets me find my car fast.<br /><br />I love this sunshade for my car. The design stands out and allows me to find my car quick. The packaging was good and the shipment was a day late but worth the wait. I would recommend this product to anyone,
B00BG6IJA0|5|It worked great!
B00852684M|1|Do not work consistently
B0057GWP6Y|5|Love It!!!!
B011TYY22W|3|200 stickers came in two seperate packs of 100 both sets of 100 were identicle. Even packaged in the same order, so i recived actually only 100 stickers in terms of variety. The selection is cool i especially liked the liscenced ones, the mix is probaby 50/50 copyrited material/random kids stickers. three stars because of the other sticker packs sold on amazon this is the cheapest for the most.
B001CDP71Q|5|Seems to work much better than what I'd been using.  I definitely recommend it.
B00COBENQA|3|A little staticky, but you can still see what you're backing up to.
B00CPL8OVE|5|Highly recommended for Diesel motors every six months.
B00062YILY|3|I'm not sure about this. I don't know if this is the reason my car is overheating or what. Shortly after I installed this part, my car started to overheat. It may be the new a/c installed or my thermostat going out. I don't have a noticeable difference in my MPG. I'm not sure of this product. Once I get everything looked at, I might change this review. Do your research and ask around before buying an air filter for your vehicle. I've heard good things about the reusable K&N filters and that is why I bought one for my 1992 Buick Roadmaster 5.7L V8 Limited.
B00276LCX4|4|Fits great!
B007KPW222|5|Nice product! Looks great on my xl883l
B004XAXE2Y|5|just as advertised,good strong chain
B00FDQPCR2|5|Bought two of these lights - they came when they said they would be here. The lights are bright and allows me to find my car in the light.  Saves electricity and I feel safer.
B00OGQHF3E|5|Thanks
B00C309NN0|3|nice sturdy and works..i was just disappointed that once you got it mounted the cover case or the passenger seat didnt close flush..the case cover will have to be altered to get a proper fit.
B007V2DMGE|5|Best product on the market. Plus, it fits like a glove.
B00NA7OH7W|5|Bright
B006CQVGYK|5|Great
B00HVRBH5W|3|Good  just a little too small
B000XQ9MGE|5|Has never failed me.
B0009IBJBM|5|Workhorse at a great price I bought 2.
B000C55MH4|4|A bit too bouncy for a daily driver. Used on my 1969 C10 pickup. They are perfect for hauling heavy loads however. Adjusts perfectly to the load in my truck bed.
B00DMA1O2S|4|I have a 2004 JDM Subaru Legacy GT 2.0 Turbo auto, The CV joint fit great but the boot bag was a little short.
B005LTCNRI|2|It's awesome, but with regular use, the pictures fade after about a year, which is actually pretty disappointing because it's not cheap compared to other more generic versions of steering wheel covers.
B002OMIS2O|5|Just what I needed.  Quick shipment!  Thanks
B0055SYJ8Q|5|Very pleased
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Works great. Started the car three different time on the same charge...it works!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Perfect for my Honda CRV! Easy to put up and then take down and fold away.
B0002UEN1A|4|Does what it says on the tin.
B008KZKANO|4|Works as advertised.
B000B8JUNY|5|Great Product.
B005LXTOEY|5|This product was very simple to install, took about an hour and that was taking it nice and slow. All holes lined up perfectly and fit just like the original part.
B0018YD4I2|5|Awesome shocks great build quality
B00XWC0K4Y|4|Pretty easy to install, but two issues.  First was the claim that the hitch fits my current car. It does, but not without some grinding with a die grinder.  It took about 1 hour to open up holes in the frame large enough to accommodate the bolts and spacers.  Second was that the instructions did not tell you the order in which to replace some of the plastic shielding under the car - this lead to another 30 minutes of re-work.  All told, a project I was expecting to take 2 hours took 3 hours.
B000WJX4BQ|5|This is my first experience with a Maintenance Free battery. That said, I had no problems getting the battery charged and installed on my ATV.
B00TPQHIMS|5|Works great.
B000BYD73C|5|Excellent product, well built and an exact fit for my car.
B00E5P180M|4|After I cut it to size it fit well.  It does have a strong &#34;rubber&#34; smell that is very obvious when you open the trunk.
B001CO6ZHA|5|It fits perfectly for my 2001 ML320, and save several hundred dollars from the mechanic. It is quite straightforward to install also, if you follow instructions.
B000EEU0KM|5|Relieved my pain
B004HCS4P0|1|Terrible on plastic trim. Lasts for....  a few days then runs down the paint leaving streaking residue on the trim and paint.  Tires (rubber) mediocre at best, but at least no streaks on the tire or the aluminum rim (yet)
B00FPGJH7G|5|I love them... No assemble necessary and apply to windows...
B006XKAAAQ|2|The chrome bar is very thin, and the BMW 2001-2006 is abount 3&#34; wide. Not a direct replacement unless you like the thin chrome line.<br /><br />This should be made as the original size of the actual BMW bar
B000TRBOK4|2|Nice dishpan but too large for rv sink.  That is what I was looking for with this search.
B0116GZP1A|3|like it
B00NY1Y9EU|5|Nice
B00UIW6W0C|5|Awesome addition to my suzuki dr 650 se. Look great and definitely would consider in the future. fit perfectly and look great.
B000FUNZF2|5|Royal purple wins again with this gun oil. It's definitely hard to find locally and great that Amazon sells it with Prime. A word of suggestion, a little goes a LONG WAY. I had to learn how to use this gun oil properly. The properties of RP's oil is different than your normal oils. It seeks out and finds metals to bind to. What that means is, after application, you will see it seeping through the seams of your gun. I've used this for several years, no jams, no funky build up. Stays clean and lubricated.
B006RJPE8G|4|People gets the point but aren't really big stickers
B00VX7CK4S|5|The Trash-Zilla bag is even better than its photos and description in the sales promo.<br />It is well made with ballistic nylon quality material with strong seams and straps. The main compartment, with a Velcro closure, has a black waterproof interior lining. A 5” x 10” front pouch and mesh pockets on either side can be used to store necessary items (bottles, laptop etc). An adjustable buckle strap, intended to hang it in the car, can also be used as a handle.<br /><br />The bag can be used as a trash container, an organizer or a combination of both. It can be hung on the car headrest facing backwards or frontwards, or used as a gear bag, or for shopping...it is so versatile that it's uses are limited only by one’s imagination.<br /><br />I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees.
B004X96DLE|4|It works pretty well! You can still see where the scratches were, but not unless you're up very close! It is a little runny, so be careful! Got a good bit of it on my hands, but acetone gets it off!
B00UNTU3VO|5|This is for my husband's Classic Mustang and it is exactly what he was looking for.  He is very happy with it.
B005ZWM0R4|5|This tool has been a great asset to my garage.  I couldn't live without it.  Easy plug and play with the software.
B0006O2S8M|4|Seems to work fine.
B002QO3VHM|1|will not work  can not program with Comcast co.
B0022ZT69C|5|love yuasa batteries  hope they last
B00DHQ5TZ0|5|Perfect fit for my Honda Civic 2013. I love these Reflectors, they are sturdy and effective. I have one for each of my cars. If you get this, you will not be dissappointed.
B001PWFPRU|5|Excellent.........LOVE IT.
B00IKQ2DO2|4|Ok
B007NZ60PO|4|The information concerning the skirt said &#34; smooth&#34;.  This is like all the otherw I considered, textured.  So, I have one smooth (original) and one textured.  However, as if is often not checked, I will use the fender skirt on the 5th wheel.  I do wish it had been  as it was advertixed.
B001UG0ZXA|5|yes I do love the seat covers and very nice I love soon with some of my friends over to buy some from you I'll give you a 5 star feedback your best seller thanks to you and Amazon
B0067P7DRA|1|got the wrong one and wires were pinched or cripped
B000EBKG5E|3|It's okay.
B000J2NYUM|5|Usefull...
B0118V28AY|5|Nice and light weight. Very comfortable.<br />I wish the visor was a little bigger. Great price.
B00I548S2K|5|They fit perfect and looks great
B010TBEID4|5|Excellent product. Easy to put on car. I have leather seats and since I live in the south it's nice to know after a hot day no more burnt legs! Lol, much better than pop up shades.
B000CMKG6E|5|Installed on my 2005 Durango perfect! Loved how simple this was to install. I like how they give you extra slack for whatever your installation needs may be. This saves you all the time of having to splice wires and go all the way to the battery/fuse box. These plug in and install right behind your brake lights.
B007HBQ22K|5|Good replacement...pricey, but far less than my dealer wanted
B0014DGSGM|5|Worked just fine on my 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe LTD 3.3L
B007H8DKJG|5|Works great, use gasket maker to make the damns as instructed in the GM revised work order.
B008T4YOV0|5|Excellent Products!!! This is Protection is Perfect!!!
B00BUMCC08|4|It was a good buy.
B006WNR7H8|5|Works great
B00PV6VDUY|5|I am 100% Satisfied with the product provided by Ameritree. Delivery was quick and prompt and the item in question works as described . The ONLY part of this transaction that I dislike is the fact that I will have to buy another kit to totally replace all the stock lights in my 2014 SV Maxima. On my Model there are four courtesy lights on each door and lights on the Driver and passenger side where your feet go. I was also not able to replace trunk light or the reading light on the drivers passenger side. But thats my fault for not counting how many lights I needed. Product suits my needs and obviously Ill be buying another set to fully deck out my car. Ill post pictures when I have all the lights switched out.
B000GZJDH0|5|exactly what my quad needed. easy mounting and hold everything I need.
B005BNYY26|5|we had hail damage which destroyed the one on our camper.......this one is great quality and even better than the original.......good buy
B00Y43N9UW|4|Everything was great, but the clamps
B00LI36VG0|5|Excellent
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great value, they are exactly as pictured and described. Also arrived early.
B00GHT646C|5|Excellent product.  Quick order fulfillment.  Would buy from them again.
B000OZSAGW|4|Haven't used it yet, but I can tell by the quality it's good. Comes with a bag made from the same material.
B0032J1KAK|5|Very happy didn't think they would work as good as they do . I'm amazed !!!
B001U58A1A|3|look nice but smaller.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|This is keeping my Harley upright during these Texas hot hot days!  Light weight and easy to store.
B00390BS7C|5|Worked perfect to remove the 02 sensor from my Accord. Great tool to have around if you are needing to change the O2 sensor.
B00JBIRBYA|2|I bought these for my chevy truck about 2 weeks ago. Not very impressed with them, they are not bright enough to drive with at night. They look good when installed, just a little disappointed in the brightness.
B000GU5CZ2|1|bought this item in oct.2014 installed on my harley , put it up for the winter , been driving put only 1000 miles on bike took it back to dealer was told starter drive was NOT WORKING, I am very disappointed with this product, I was told the warranty was up nov. 17 2014 .. I tried to call laleterica. ( not sure of the name ) from amazon, 310-530-6410 two times no answer, two times a fax line went on , so I am no moron I would have checked warranty info , none on the page??????????? ( it would greatly help if amazon put warranty info up or make it easier to find... very unhappy customer ..........
B0040CZ79S|5|Good product as explained on the ad.
B008Y3NZ0W|5|Didn't fit my truck motor at all . lost shipping return label . looked like it was for ford
B008O1N1JE|5|Great,.
B004DDHXCI|5|2002 Ford Explorer. Priced at $1200+ to fix the shifter. Found this and total cost was about $48 and 35 minutes time to repair it. Perfect fit. Works perfectly.
B003TUNRGM|2|Foil face started to separate from rubber after a year in my doors. Now when I roll my windows up and down it scrapes like nails on a chalk board.
B003XWG7R2|1|Bought this item to replace a 13 year old power window kit that had failed. The replacement would barely roll down the windows in my 1970 VW Beetle (small glass, rolls up and down very easily with hand crank), and would not roll them up at all. Returned the kit at my expense, three weeks ago, and I'm still waiting on a refund.....
B0052AKQ9I|5|Great product, excellent quality
B009D4KUPY|5|Looks really good Toyota Camry se
B002X1JWTY|5|its a very good product
B00CN40PEM|5|it is pretty easy to installe and it is very soft
B000SXCLIS|5|I have an 05 dyna superglide the cover fit great .  It's sturdy and fit over my saddlebags windshield covers the whole bike.  I'm installing 16&#34; ape hangers soon and I think this cover will still fit fine
B007NEV1R2|5|looks great on the truck. fit perfectly over stock brake light. the screws that come with it are gold in color so i just used the stocks ones.
B000FW2MWW|4|ok
B000Q6A5JE|5|The stinger adjustable tool make it simple to remove my car fan clutch, it's a great tool.
B004MXN71U|5|Easy replacement for our old thermostat.
B003UHNMMS|5|No need to spend 50 bucks on a test light.  This thing works perfect.  Love it.
B00GSAUHB8|4|I replaced a folding sun protector with this wire ring type protector and like to use it much better.  It's much more compact but may not keep as much heat out as the folding/thicker type but the ease of use is worth it to me.
B000C808UW|5|good
B003XINQE8|1|they look very nice but if you have TPMS don't buy it
B0089HUROU|5|The dash cover sits perfect in my TL. They give you plenty of velcro and you definitely won't use all of it. Just enough to hold it on the dash.
B00VZP1IXW|4|These are effective in terms of putting out light and being fire-safe. But as someone who's been first on the scene to help at many, many accidents, I have a key misgiving. These are powered by AAA batteries, and standard batteries leak and corrode when left unused for a long time - say in the hot and cold trunk of your car. Emergency gear needs to meet a high standard of reliability; when and if something happens years after you bought the gizmo, it has to work for you under stress and in usually terrible conditions. Being as these are LED, they could be powered by a smaller and less failure-prone button-style battery. I'd suggest carrying batteries in a bag with these and putting them in if you need to use the flares, and that could easily work in a breakdown. But I promise if you're in a wreck in the middle of the night and it's snowing and you're rattled out of your skull, trying to align and screw in batteries with wet and bloody hands is going to be the last task you're suited for.<br /><br />Road flares can start forest fires, ignite flammable fluid leaks, and don't last long before burning out. But there's a reason police at least in my area light them up like birthday candles around the scene of accidents, and a reason I carry them: They work. You can pull out a road flare that's been kicking around the trunk for two years and looks like a stick of expired dynamite, and it'll light up in the middle of the wind and rain when your hands are shaking. They are also a universal signal for &#34;wreck&#34; and will usually keep burning if someone runs over them. If you're in a high fire danger area where carrying flares can't be justified, or you're just plain scared of incendiary flares, these will be good to have, but bear in mind you should use them and/or change out the batteries every couple months.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

B000HBIAKO|5|Excellent product. Make sure you shake it for 1 minute before use for maximum performance. I used it to re apply leather to the inside of my car door. Solved a problem that other glues failed at.
B000GTUR8U|5|Works Great easy to install
B002ZKGY2Q|5|Works great. Extremely happy with the product and price point. I'm glad I was able to find this compressor on Amazon than going directly through the dealer. Arrived quickly.
B004BSUHT6|5|This air freshener smells divine, and because it doesn't look like any other air freshener out there, I can freshen the inside of my car without being obvious about it.
B00I8SHGHG|5|Sounds great, will get a short video in days to come. Definitely would purchase from Coffman again.<br /><br />Only complaint is in the item description, it says &#34;race car sounds.&#34; Let's grow up a little bit and remove that.<br /><br />Thanks.
B002UCYRZU|4|This worked exactly as advertised.  I had scratches on my truck's instrument panel shield, so I pulled it out and went through this process during the course of an episode of Better Call Saul.  You can't even see where it was scratched anymore.  Saved me $65 since I didn't have to by a new shield.
B004GC8VLI|4|good fit.
B00D3298A0|5|These are perfect!  I bought these for a 2015 Jeep Compass and they fit perfectly!  There was no need to cut or trim for fitting.  It was easy as simply placing them in the proper spot.  They look and feel great!  Such a great deal!
B001VXXUWK|5|Good product, all o.k. thank's
B00KQSMVQW|5|running great
B003NS5NK8|5|wow it's really clean my headlight.
B0006GF5SK|5|As good as any others I have used and the price was great! What more? Giver!
B003OCY1WO|1|No because normally these type of switches come with a wiring harness
B00GBQ5U1G|5|Loveit
B001O0AKDM|3|The threads on these seemed to be a bit sloppy on my Subaru and stripped one of the wheel studs out when torqued to 85 ft-lbs.  I could not get a single lugnut for a replacement, so I had to buy another entire set of 20, and replace one of the wheel studs on the car.
B00U5SOC74|5|Took out my gokart huge air cleaner box and put this thing on a pipe from the carb. It really felt like it helped a little bit on torque.
B00KMR3F8U|5|Definitely easy to install and would purchase again..I have put this on an 2009 F-150 and a 2009 Chevy Silverado.  Each vehicle was a lit bit different wiring but lights up great...Both reverse and brake lights and the turn signals of course.  This is good stuff and can't beat the price versus other ones which in all honesty lights like there are going to go out after 2 or 3 years because that just happens...no light ever will last you a lifetime.  So be cautious and weary of other manufactures guaranteeing ridiculous non-reality agreements.
B00NFE0TFY|4|Perfectly fine product. What you see is what you get. No big mystery.
B009DJJZQE|5|Working very good!
B000SOFLL6|4|Needs to have filter mounted lower.  Excess fuel pools below screens
B000LET1O6|5|Works exactly as you would expect but it is much more useful than I thought.
B0073JDIWI|2|These looked amazing until the black paint came off after about 2 months. Now they are just a copper color and dont look very good at all. the bio hazard symbol is still in perfect shape,
B00BFDFJA2|5|Great price and quick delivery.
B000VYJSTO|5|Was exactly what I was looking for.
B00ANA5YO4|5|This floor mat fit like a glove and is easy to clean. it keeps the Grandkids spills very well contained.
B00PKFANFC|4|A really nice looking set of seat covers. They were easy to install, and look nice.<br /><br />Just be careful, when installing. The seat cover is made like a sleeve, so be careful with the opening that goes past the head rest. I had one that was a little snug, and through my own fault, the seat cover suffered a little split at the seam.
B00JUQFVX6|5|I have to say it works pretty well with my car. I have a 2004 Chevy Impala. I don't have kids, but I carry things with me that I like to keep in the car such as interior wipes, extra air fresheners, a notebook, bandaids, and those sorts of things. This worked out perfectly with my car. It has an adjustable strap on the bottom to fit around the front seat, which is really what I was hoping for because I wouldn't be able to stand having it hang. With my seats, you can't even feel the straps anchoring it because they slide between the cushions.
B00HCQFJL0|3|Good item
B000C7XM42|5|Great for value
B00FAYLPZK|5|works very well.
B00G4BYY3I|5|Good product
B00K588W8Y|4|Not a perfect fit.
B000BYGGVC|5|Great value
B00UVXDIS2|3|Not strait
B00IY3YLCI|4|The lights work, but one of them came with the heat shield bent
B00FH43LOQ|1|Unfortunately this helmet limits your view, does not allow for ease of breathing and visor is not clear.  It is totally not as described and was given as a gift.  So of course the recipient is burdened with the return.
B0059HJFU0|2|I really like this pump unfortunately it started leaking after only a few months (and 4 uses) - a very bad leak between the plunger shaft and container cap. On the up stroke it would lose about 1/4 ounce with each pump.<br />I used it only for transferring dish soap into an under counter mounted kitchen sink soap dispenser.
B00032KBFE|5|For cars without built-in nuts, these screws fill the bill brilliantly.
B0030HGQ6W|5|Excellent
B00AC5J5W2|4|Pictures posted don not include the turn signals, you must reuse the factory ones that come with the bike. Gives a clean finish to the tail end of the bike.  Tail light is bright and works well both day and night.
B004SSAFAU|5|Grate product still have not installed on my car.
B00BIXXR3A|5|Easy install took about 30 to install the brackets, lights and wire up the lights. I put this on my 2008 tundra and they fit fine.
B00077KWI6|5|Fits my 2014 Chrysler Town & Country like a glove!
B00IJEA7IY|5|The knobs look and fit perfectly... I saved a fortune by buying here... I highly recommend !
B00CVFIIZG|5|Exactly what I was looking for except I made some modifications. I hated the gold chain so I cut that off and the rubber part sticking out that the chain was attached to. I also cut a slit for the valet key. I just didn't want the silver part of fob to be all scratched up.
B00UTMXVGE|5|If you are a star wars fan and have kids you need to buy this. Very happy with buying this. Thank you for making these.
B0089XOHYU|5|Water beads off very well.  Easy to apply.
B000C39CA4|5|it works good
B0083TYGZ0|4|Just a tad too hot ...
B00M3JTHUU|5|I've purchased 7 Lamphus Cruizer lights now, and absolutely love them.  They are the best value for the money, and BRIGHT!  Great product.
B0014UAZKA|4|Best short text shifter I've ever owned highly recommend it!
B007WWTJ2E|4|Haven't ran them yet, they fit mustang tri-y headers perfect except the 2nd cylinder touched the header, i just put the 90° side on the plug and the straight on the distributor.
B003V57NUQ|5|Good quality
B001F212OK|5|Excellent pump...use it on my 07 Ultra Classic rear air shocks...works perfectly!! Almost overpaid for basically the same pump from Harley!!!
B00FOX56H0|5|After this purchased this item everything was working fine, wasn't happy with the brightness of the bulbs, contacted Kensun,  without an issue sent me out a different set of bulbs which made a huge difference.  Great customer service  and support. Can't wait for the line of LED headlights to come out
B003CKKU64|4|Good price and  fits correctly.  Don't know how durable it is yet, hence only four stars...
B0027XEKQ8|4|Not a perfect fit for my project.  I guess the ceiling on my pop- up trailer is thinner than what it is designed for.  Also it doesn't come with the weather strip tape/ molding or the screws.  So be sure to purchase those when buying.
B002VISGQ4|4|Fit good. 2002 Accord. A bit lighter than original
B00V7UW35M|5|The part was what I had order and works great !!!!!
B00KLKVEAE|4|Finally my 4-wheeler runs the way it did when it was new and it is a great price. The only problem I had was that the throttle cable hole was closed off and I had to drill it out.
B00GB9VR7Y|5|Very bright. Have used it on my boat all summer. Very well built. I did make a metal cover that goes over it when not in use to simply keep from beating it up when i decide to go a little deeper in the swamp.
B004MRX284|1|This item is zinc not aluminum as pictured. And, it is not made by Yamaha as stated. This item is cheap B&S Zinc.
B009PICM9A|4|Awesome
B00KWFNMJY|5|Good product!
B002Q39Q72|5|works great , one of the best case for a truck I have never used and bought
B003VDX5D2|3|For the price this ladder works well. If you use your bed on a daily basis, this ladder is a nuisance. It is always in the way of putting stuff in and out of the bed. The strap that holds it in place ripped in a week or so of use.
B00K2B802C|5|Perfect fit on my 2014 Ram 2500 diesel. Matched perfectly with Rough Country's LED light bar. OEM quality stuff. Tow hooks were more work to remove than I expected on my truck, but the hardware included in this kit is perfect.
B00NQ6RT0E|5|First, I just didn't hope to find a replacement, it was a surprise such small part was available and at a very modest price. Its quality (both materials and workmanship) is better or at least as good as that of the original part. Replacing is quite easy but time consuming since you need to remove the glass completely from the door and then wait until the glue used to affix the clip is cured properly. There is enough detailed DIY videos on YouTube how to do that. Ultimately, it's a matter of your willingness to spend certain amount of time and get your hands a little dirty vs. paying someone else.
B00KRIJ3M6|5|Lexus quality at half the dealer price.
B00JRE38EA|5|Absolutely incredible value.  They made the dash lights in my 1994 Ford F-150 legible again.  Look at the Before and After pics!  It's simply incredible!  And yes, they do most certainly work with the dimmer switch.  Get these!
B00X9VIVZI|5|The glove, helmet, goggles fit just right. Decent quality for the price your pay.
B00153CXR4|2|After 2.5 years unit died and will not output... Only used occasionally.<br />Look elsewhere
B00I16B11C|5|Part was exact match.  Works great.
B0012WHBSO|4|It is very small and very quiet. It might not be the fastest pump ever but works just fine. Only complaint is the the gauge seems to go too high when its pumping and drops down when its not.
B008FRR6AM|4|I tested these on my adjustable bench power supply, and they do really well.<br /><br />The listed pick up voltage is 7.8v, they exceed this slightly and pick up at 7.5v. Really nice.<br />The drop out voltage is listed as 1.2v and they did not quite meet the spec and would drop out right at 3v. That is a little disappointing but for my purposes this is more than adequate.<br /><br />The coils consume right about 100mA at 12v and it drops slightly as the voltage goes down. This is not negligible, and if you're using these on a battery powered project there will be a slight impact to battery life. But considering the price, I was more than happy.<br /><br />I tested these with a dummy load at 40 amps. The relay continued to function and was only slightly warm, but the wiring became too hot to touch. At 30 amps the wiring became warm but not at a level that I would worry about as the wire is rated 70c. You could easily replace the wiring with something a higher gauge if needed and probably push this relay up to 50a before catastrophic failure.
B00KQXKG46|5|Super bright. Really blew my expectations. I don't say this much, but I highly recommend
B005OVM1KC|1|This part does not fit correctly. The cheap plastic pulley hub was jammed up right out of the box. I could not get my money back or have it replaced. Also lost 4 hours dismantling my truck to have this s***ty part not work. I've read similar reviews from people with identical issues.
B00496TKDE|5|As advertised, fast shipping, Good seller, Thanks!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Fits perfectly in my Nissan Titan.  Looks good too..most importantly it keeps the extreme heat out and protects your interior.  I have a dash cam and it keeps it out of direct sunlight. Excellent product.
B00MV1MA18|5|EXCELLENT
B00MWA3N8M|5|Love this item!  Good price good quality!
B00EC2CG9U|5|have helped<br />in tight situations on hikes and bike rides<br />really use them and hold up well
B00873J0YY|4|So I am pleased with these racks. They are very good for the price and do their job effectively. First I noticed a lot of reviews don't say what vehicle they used them with. I use them on my 2008 GMC Yukon Denali and they fit the factory roof rack fine. I did have to shorten the two longest bolts on each rack with my dremel as they were to long. No real problem with that but I wish the manufacturer could customize the bolt length with the vehicle type but I think that is high hopes for a Chinese product. I've noticed some reviews said they got galvanized replacement bolts which is not a bad idea at all but I will say it may get tricky as the bolts have a pretty specific fit in the rubber sleeve they fit into. Also at least with my vehicle the plastic spinning lock nuts are worthless. I did not use them and no issue with that. I also recommend not leaving them on your vehicle when not in use to prevent rusting and wearing the padding out in the weather. I also did not use the straps that came with them and use ratchet straps of my own. I have had no negative issues at all and they didn't move at all at highway speeds. Can't say that these truly fit all vehicles but they were good for me.
B002P8DCZU|5|fit my 2000 Dodge Stratus absolutely perfectly
B000GZP270|1|wrong size but did not know until after opening package
B00OO18UNA|5|Perfect fit, for 2000 tl Acura,
B0002KKIXC|3|No better (maybe even worse) than other carpet cleaners.
B009YE387K|5|Works great. I put this on my 4 wheeler.
B00JRTPND4|5|Handy
B003UT3S6Q|5|I bought this on the suggestion of the people on audizine.com and had considered another product but honestly, I'm really impressed with it.  The brakes on my 2013 S4 are amazing, but throw so much brake dust it's insane.  This works 100% as advertised, spray it on and watch it change colors.<br /><br />The bottle says you should just rinse, but I found using soapy wheel brushes to agitate the dust really helps out, then rinse and rinse and then rinse some more, you want all this stuff off your wheels.  It also works really well to clean brake calibers and wheel wells.<br /><br />If you have larger wheels, like the 19's on my car, and have small openings in the wheels, buy a few bottles of this stuff, you'll go through it quickly.<br /><br />I found it best to spray down two wheels at once, and go between them.  I also sprayed it directly on cool wheels, in the shade, without rinsing first.  The Internet will tell you it's a coin flip between rinsing down with water first, then applying Sonax, while others will tell you that waters down the Sonax.  The jury is still out on this.
B001DRH9K8|5|Fit my Yukon perfectly... great service!
B0010DZZQ0|4|FRAM usually OK.
B000JFHNTM|5|Used this to find leaks on my piston airplane engine. Very easy to see in a dark environment with a decent UV flashlight.
B003RXEG0C|4|had to get it programmed
B00MTXD01M|5|This stuff works magic on carbureted vehicles right on the cusp of requiring a go through. Bikes, utvs, atvs you name it.
B0009NWQWI|5|Liked the product and was very helpful.
B000FQ793A|5|Works Perfect!
B0036GGDLA|5|GREAT PRODUCTS.
B00449MO7A|1|I spent a lot of money on this cat and it didn't even make it 50,000 miles! Then their warranty department blew me off saying they don't warranty efficiency. It didn't even come with the O2 sensor wiring bracket. Had to make a custom bit to hold the wiring away from the exhaust. Now I'm on Amazon buying a different brand since OEM is almost $1,300 and I have to pass an emissions inspection in just a few weeks.
B004I13CZW|5|Fits right in place at 1/3 the cost of having the garage supply and install it.
B000ARPVT8|5|delivered on time in perfect condition. fit my Yamaha outboards - both the 50 hp and the 115hp.
B004KEHHDK|4|very handy tool
B006XV9GSC|5|it was an exact replacement filter for my BMW. I really liked the fact it came with a new brass washer for the drain plug.
B0064FXRWI|5|Nice lamps for the price
B00CQUW8J8|4|I rigged these up on my fourwheeler for brake and tail lights. Worked well and bright
B005JU5VH8|1|Received this wiper blade about two months ago and immediately installed it on my car. After using it I noticed that the wiper wasn't any better than the year and a half old one I just took off my car. I decided to just send it back and go with rain x blades from my local store and they seem to work much better so far. Its a shame because I loved my Bosch ones I had before.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Best price on the internet. Replaced all my 194 lamps on my boat with these LED's . You get a brighter long lasting light.
B008FXP8GK|5|This is sweet. Bolted right on to my 2003 Suzuki TL1000R
B00E5OUOCQ|2|It is not fit with my FIT
B003Y3UGKE|4|Super handy tool.  Much easier to work in confined areas using this compared to traditional wire strippers.  If I had to find one point of criticism, I would like to have the ability to set a longer strip length than the 1/2&#34; max allowed by this tool.  Overall though, this is a good buy.
B002UNK9VA|5|Working great here in SUNNY CANADA at -10.
B001NY3LXU|5|Good quality, was delivered quickly !!
B0027UPPK6|5|Fixed My winch ASAP I would shop here again
B0017KOPEO|1|Corners don't sit well
B00V90U1PO|5|Fits. And works good
B00ES2HTTQ|4|It is small, you need to be close to the bumper to read.
B001OBT780|1|It came apart after a few short weeks.  screw stripped out and will not stay together
B00FOOV40W|5|Works great!!
B00AMMCE3C|5|Love them very pretty they are as advertised a mettalic red looks cool
B000GOJWBS|5|Rather then shelling out $200 at a shop to get this fixed, I youtubed some videos and had a new blower motor in my truck in under an hour. Fits perfect for my model and this thing blows! In a good way!
B003CKGM66|5|The only front tire I run period. JDayoffroad.com if you would like to see what I do with this front tire you may also youtube jday.
B0002SRFLC|5|best thing out there to remove driveshafts from your car.<br />ordered this from England.<br />fantastic delivery from america, thank you.
B0002F66G0|5|Fits great and went on easy.  Great price, much better than the RV store.
B000COU1YO|4|Good quality product
B000EQFOQA|5|Worked out great. It fit right in and was the reason the old one wasnt working right.
B00D3298A0|5|Love the mats.

B000XY2YEI|5|Happy I spent the extra money for these pads no more dust on my pm wheels
B0081RWZIO|5|Nice for the money. Higher quality amd more complete kit than house brands for<br />about same price.
B000HZA24W|2|constantly slipped.  did not stay locked.
B00OOOULNO|5|They had a little trouble with the maximum angle needed on the ball joint but it does work. It's as if the socket  was too tight and did not allow the maximum angle needed but if you push it a little it works fine
B000GZKYVO|5|Fits great, well made, best of all it comes with the foam seal to replace the deteriorated factory one.
B000BLKV9S|4|Works fine. Easy install. Higher price than other brand bulbs, and aren't necessarily &#34;better&#34;
B00WXQBUQ2|5|good price for this item.
B004I1B67I|5|The depo headlight fit great, thanks😎
B005FNKSMW|5|works good
B006R22YV8|5|100% satisfied, salesman 100%
B00BI1U8VQ|5|Easy to install and works great !
B00C394YZ8|2|This review applies to both Girodisc front and back pads.<br /><br />I had these on my 2011 STI and I certainly wouldn't buy them again. Let's talk about brake squeal. I don't mean a minor squeal, I mean a full blown banshee wailing. People knew when I was coming home because you could hear me braking a block away. I tried everything I could do to stop them. Only until I REALLY mashed the brake pedal was I then able to get them to stop making noise.....temporarily. Who wants to do that though? I also gooped these up with some CRC Disc Brake Quiet and that did absolutely nothing.<br /><br />In addition to the ridiculous train like noise I had when slowing down. The stopping power was relatively good until they got warm. Unfortunately getting them warm was the only way to stop the noise. There was quite a lot of brake fade running hot temperatures. I realize this is natural but I felt like I could put my foot to the floor on some occasions and not stop. I don't know if this is all attributed to semi-metallic pads (I doubt it) but I will be grabbing ceramics next time....and certainly not from Girodisc.<br /><br />The only thing magic about them was how so much noise can come from something so small.
B000CQ4DK0|5|I use this grease all the time!<br />I use it to grease my zerk fittings on my outer tie rods, sway bar end links and bushings.<br /><br />This is a fully synthetic grease that is black in color so it should last longer if used in the correct applications of -60°F to 425°F.<br />This comes in a tube form so you can load it into your grease gun.<br />If you do not have a grease gun, get this the tub version instead. It's the same exact thing.<br />[[ASIN:B000GAN3I0 Valvoline VV986 SynPower Synthetic Grease (for all US, European and Japanese Vehicles), 16 oz.]]
B008535CTS|5|Works great and look wonderful on the boat. Delivered super quick.
B00CLMBE5A|4|Perfect fit! I have the turbo with dual exhaust, if I had to do it again I would remove the mufflers to make it a lot easier. Oh and definitely buy the exhaust bushing removal tool. I made it work with some large channel lock pliers... but that was a lot of muscle and sweat to get them off. If I lived in a salty environment I would make sure to coat the area where you grind out the holes during installation, otherwise I could imagine some serious rust issues. Looks good and works well!
B00CG674GY|5|Like this  but hose is just a little long. Hard to handle sometimes.
B000K7HCOA|2|Not flushed and no running lights
B00M5CYW6O|5|Was advertised part, works great on my 02 6x4 gator
B00F8TZLE8|5|its metal so it will last looks great on my truck
B00P2K08J6|4|the right turn signal blinks when turning right, i wish there was a way that only the brake light would operate and not the right turn signal
B008B5X5GC|5|Matched original part in a 2010 Malibu.  There was no problem once install to reprogram the system to recognize it. Random low pressure messages are now gone. (old sensor battery failure).
B00IS94K6K|1|I have a 2013 jeep wrangler jk Two door and these mounts did not fit. my boyfriend had to drill the holes out bigger so that they would line up. so unless you don't mind having to modify them once you get them then your great. but if your looking for something that works right out of the box don't waste your money! the holes weren't even close to lining up!!
B0068FXXEQ|4|These replacement hoses are a huge improvement over the origional ones, good job Baron!
B000LY4UBU|5|Great book
B0013FZVEG|5|&#34;Ditto&#34; Matched the originals. Easy to install and they perform flawlessly. Price was very reasonable. What more can be said.
B00QWHHJLS|4|They are very sturdy and give you excellent vision
B001FAIAJ2|4|Very nice solution to wet floorboards. Looks good and the screw holes lined up with the ones on the factory vent like they should. Installed on a 94 yj
B000Q3OTQC|5|K&N makes great filters
B00GOXMTBK|5|great
B0090YKAHU|5|Was pleasantly surprised hope they wear well and hold up they add a SMILE to my day : )
B00OGSBS80|5|great to have in your vehicle!
B00EA66EXM|5|Added this item and lower grills. Subtle change but they work together to provide a custom look to my 300 in a clean and sophisticated manner.<br />Don't wait, buy this item now.
B005DJFXY6|5|Love the item  - received as promised.  Item easy to use.  performs as expected.  feet stay dry.
B00CFQ5GY2|1|junk. broke first time in use
B000CITSJE|5|this replaced my original chevy small block timing gear set. it fits underneath the factory timing cover. Cloyes is of the finest quality and is much better quality than stock.
B00TL3QFLK|5|The shipping was fast and excellent. Said it would be here between the 6th and 10th of this month. Well it arrieved a day early which im very happy about. The helmet is comfortable has nice vents. Its absolutely perfect.
B000C9TVFE|5|A Plus, why pay more for non-OEM parts.  Buy this one.
B00B1UI4MY|5|Works great and stays on very well. Don't forget to take off the hazy film after applying the decal. That makes it look much better. I was worried at first.
B002UC4TIK|5|Perfect replacement part for my Coleman Roanoke Popup Camper.
B00L9OTDCM|1|Glass part fell out of the housing as soon as they came out of the box! Other mirror was broken! Absolutely horrible product. Wish I had read the reviews before buying as this seems to be a common problem.
B000E81VN8|5|Fits the trunk well in a Tesla-S perfectly.  Nice product, great price.  I love it.
B00JIUKHG0|3|have not used yet they look good
B00LNJI1KI|3|Sent a 20&#34; Light Bar the first time, after some emails I received the right one.  Hooked it up to a 12V small battery and it worked great.  Will be mounting it to my Jeep and give it a full test soon.
B00IEIFNGQ|2|They are super cute, my problem is that I have no way of putting the backseat covers on because I was not informed that it doesn't come with the s hooks. Or did I just not get mine.
B00SBZRELY|5|Works very well, Was concerned about sparks from DC motor transferring gasoline, but couldn't fined anything in documentation regarding this. Decided to try it and it worked very well.
B004J30GJY|2|Good part, great service.
B00D2QL0DU|2|this pump lasted less than a month. I used it mainly to get water out of my boat cover. with all the internal parts being plastic it, the nut on the inside broke rather quickly (on 3rd use) so I replaced it with a metal nut and it worked fine for a time. I was unable to contact the manufacturer, this was a waste of 10 dollars.
B00VU1E4CI|5|is good
B001CQWM8E|2|The clamp is too small for my Kubota ATV. It doesn't even come close to fitting the roll cage bar.
B00QMU0JB2|5|Looks awesome in truck easy to install
B00192HPOC|5|As a new RV'er I wanted to ensure that my new Class A didn't suffer from some of the issues on the units on dealers' lots with refrigerators  crammed full of wasp nests.  This does the job extremely well.  It comes with a total of 6 zip ties which only allows for 2 per screen on my unit.  As long as they are, they tend to sag in the middle, enough to allow bugs to enter.  I added a 3rd zip tie near the center to ensure that it would not sag and allow any critters to enter.
B001V8PRBM|4|These work good with the rubber ramp I bought and the price if right.
B004LF3HQO|5|Works great on my TPO Roof - had to clean an area where I was mounting a new TV Antenna. Cleans back to white white!
B000EH2SPO|5|I put a different hose on it and it is now perfect.
B00KSXW26O|5|Excellent color and quality.
B005XOYWZC|4|Fits well!!
B00F47ZK0Y|5|This is an amazing product. Very easy to install. Took me no more then 30 mins to get it done. Product arrived quick and with out any dicrepancies. A big thank you for your great customer service skills as wel .
B007TY4L82|4|Nice part for the money, works and fits well and quick ship
B008FC62Q6|5|great
B007ACZTIY|5|Good product, seems well built. Wish I would have gone larger for ATV but for scooter and motorcycle the small is perfect. These should keep an normally honest person from stealing by rolling away. You cant stop all crime but this product will be a deterrent.
B00KBBL4H6|5|Very nice tire pressure gauge. Mechanic quality, you will love checking the pressure
B002309ITO|5|Good quality oil.
B00XFQYTZS|5|Very versatile gizmo.  Will jump-start your car or charge your gizmos.  Very compact and in a (pretty) nice case - just wish it were black instead of dayglo green.
B0013CP8N8|1|Bought a pair to replace two previous bulbs. Unfortunately, when installed they flickered a lot for me, and do not work as expected, (even with capacitor) connected to 35w ballast. (Checked both bulbs on both ballasts)
B0049DYVVS|5|Replaced a broken factory part perfectly
B001FAGJC2|5|Easy to install. Great beefy look
B00432S99U|5|I am using this on low power to flood an area approximately 30 to 40 feet away with gentle light.  It is for the deer who night feed and bright lights would scare them. This is working all night long on low power and is a gentle light cast over the area.  You couldn't read in the light at 40 feet, but it will keep you out of trouble by being able to see any obstacles on the ground or little animals and snakes wanting to say &#34;hello.&#34; The set up was simple and the instructions were clear. On/Off and low/high power with a long cord that connects the solar panel to the light itself.
B0014WAERW|3|This frame is nice, but I've seen higher quality. My main complaint is that there are no lower tabs to hold the frame and license plate close together.
B0002Q7ZKK|5|worked great on  my 86 Yota  4x4 ...plug n play! since Yota's have separate brake and turn signal circuits, this is what you need to hook up trailer wiring. I'm an A.S.E. certified Master Mechanic...I tell you no bull!
B00KSDSYCK|2|Does not fit.
B00K1M0U5C|5|I loved this product! Easy to install and the car looks great!
B003NV83BG|5|Bright, Easy yet tedious installation.
B001DKRKGS|1|Did not work for my VW Passat
B0085ILPTO|5|Just what I expected..
B00LSTE2SS|5|Good deal
B0040HA9Y6|5|So far so good! Just used the yesterday.  Love it
B00KCQSM9S|3|it's a cover
B0002KKVKC|5|Great product--good for rubber and more delicate stuff as well.
B000N2XOHQ|5|Bought for someone else, worked as advertised...
B0014B85TM|4|Great pads for my 2007 Sonata. Received quickly, right fit, brand new.
B001HATY36|5|This is the best trailer lock on the market in my opinion. It is not easy for want to be thieves to knock this lock off or break it like most others on the market.  I only use this lock for all of my trailers!
B00OOHQXC4|5|Need an oil filter wrench for a Chevy Spark?  Here it is.  Got it in 5 days! Works great!
B001EOYIEA|4|The Hitch is wonderful (and I would give it 5 stars) but the paint job on it and the receiver was less than perfect and chipping off in some places. Needed the hitch now, or I would have returned it.<br />Installation was easy although I did make a couple extra bolt leaders to help. along with a hydraulic floor jack. Took me about 45mins to install by my self.
B00G620ZVU|4|For a budget led setup, these work well.  Not the brightest out there but they definetly put out some light.  I had trouble with the mounting bolts that hold the light to the bracket coming loose.  I ended up using loctite on the bolts and haven't had a problem since.  I wired this to a relay and switch but they could probably be wired to a switch and battery setup.  Would buy again.
B00U1PEH7Q|1|Passenger side blade separated after about 6 months of very light  use. Very poor design
B000NJ6F16|5|this is what I order, but did not receive this particular product.  I did receive a different product and it works great.
B001GPYRWK|3|Not mirrored look.
B009XA9UB8|2|Had this item for a little over a month and stopped working. Now I have to contact the manufacturer to see if I get any type of warranty.
B00W81EAE6|3|I works.<br />but product is cheaply build. the connection terminal are loose and sink in the back of the compressor when you try to connect wires.
B00TZAJY0I|5|Beautiful!!
B00KTHXZLU|5|Excellent product. My Toyota key fob's  plastic eyelet had broken and I had been using those soft rubber covers ( went through several of those)  and one neoprene cover, but didn't like either ( the rubber ones have a rubber eyelet which easily breaks/tears and  both  kinds cheesy looking and feeling). This is a great solution: just pry open the cover of your busted fob cover and snap this one on over the &#34;guts&#34; of the fob. Perfect fit and looks like new. Only drawback is that  they seem to be offered only in pairs. Still, they're well worth the price IMHO.
B00EACQXUK|5|good product
B00LWXJ5XC|1|junk
B009F0V5AK|3|It comes with 3 plastic inserts for different sizes with no threads.  Worked for a few shift's and then got loose.  Ended up Gluing it on.
B000A8MZ78|5|Never had any check engine lights that were spark plug related or had one fail or crack on install or removal(I use anti seize). I used these in a D17A2 Honda engine out of a 2002 Honda Civic EX, these replaced 2 year old/45 thousand mile old NGK spark plugs that had no problems just preventative maintenance. I don't know why people use other brands when the price difference is less then 10% and most of the time these are what the factory had from the start. If you depend on your car these are something you can trust and depend on with a high enough trust that you will forget about them.
B00XKEMBC8|5|Light exceeded my expectations, will definitely purchase all of my lighting needs in the future from ARSENAL OFFROAD.<br />  THANKS,  TATER
B00EOX2KZ2|5|I can now sleep at night!
B007CX6IBI|5|Ok
B0002NIK7U|3|Works great
B00P2NTX1C|5|EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR FOR MY RAV4 2008. NOW MY WHEELS LOOK NEW :)
B00GKTZAHS|1|Looks cheaply made. Printed on ink jet.
B000C13UF4|1|I've had to replace this regulator four times.  Just last week it broke again. I don't understand why you're using plastic retention brackets. Horrible product.  I have probably spent $1000 over that last 8 years replacing multiple regulators on all four doors.
B00HJDUNWQ|5|I purchased these for my 2014 Toyota Corolla. I previously replaced my incandescent Tail/Brake light bulbs with the Red LED bulbs and loved them. This is an inexpensive and reliable way to update the lighting system on your car. On the 2014 Corolla (and some other vehicles), you will need to add a load resistor (6-Ohms, 50W) to the turn signal contact for each turn signal to avoid hyper-flashing. For combination lights, like the front turn signals, you only need to load resistor for the turn signal contact - there is no need for the load resistor on the parking light contact, so make sure you know which is which. These load resistors can be purchased with splice connectors or you can purchase a &#34;boxed&#34; load resistor that connects inline with your existing wiring. Cautionary note: the &#34;boxed&#34; load resistor may not have the correct bulb connector for your vehicle, so check before purchasing. With some older vehicles, you can purchase a flasher unit to replace your factory flasher instead of using the load resistors. However, for 2013 and later Corollas, this is not possible since there is no flasher unit - the flasher circuitry is integrated into the dash panel. The best option is the load resistors.
B005EY2X16|5|Fits perfectly on our Equinox and for a lot less money than what the dealership wanted to charge us.
B002NLGX0A|5|good quality and nice clean look as well!
B005SUU2HS|2|No issues with the seller at all.  Good service and delivery of the product.<br /><br />  The idea of the product is quite good and useful.  The bulk of the construction is good and built to last.  The problem lies with retaining the tip where it belongs.  It is not held securely and came loose the first time I used it.  The tip can be put back but it will not stay and doesn't hold the tip well enough to even turn the idle screws on my KZ1000.  The provision for the depth of reach needs to be re-designed to allow greater depth also.
B001NZSFHG|5|Only wish it was longer.  (That's what she said.)
B00B03MGLM|5|Great product would buy again
B00E3BQQ5K|3|Look great but stalks about about .5&#34; too short for a softail.
B00BHD4QKY|5|Great look beautiful on my go badge license holder
B00AJ0X82I|1|Said it would fit 2005 kx 125. Sprockets fit perfect but the chain was 6 links too long .....
B000CAYSF6|5|Fit perfectly on 2002 civic lx
B001PGWXJ4|5|Started by cutting some diamond plate...... Square tubing and then weld + bolted as an elevated unit to our race car trailer
B000EQ3EC6|5|Not wanting to pay $60 for the oil-change pirates to install a new one in my Mazda 3, I decided to replace it myself.<br /><br />The filter arrived very quickly.  Seemed sturdy and well-built.  On the manliness-handiness scale, I'm probably right about average, and installed this with no trouble whatever.<br /><br />I have no Air-Filter-Quality-O-Meter, but I have no reason to believe that it is not performing well.  At any rate, this was a much better value for me than paying someone else a lot more to put a product in that I didn't see or touch.
B009GLDSTO|5|Awesome. Easy to install, great price.
B001GANBRC|3|Was great for about six months, then the fake leather started to peel off of the sides.
B0090NTU86|5|works great.
B001D8XA50|5|this can is great in our small rv bathroom.
B004002CS4|3|I like this rack but it's got a few drawbacks:<br /><br />- The rubber straps that make it impossible for the wheel to come out of the cradle seem cheaply made.  One of mine has broken already and another is on its way out, after only a few weeks and half a dozen times mounting/unmounting the bike.<br /><br />- On my Jeep Wrangler it's impossible to open the tailgate with the rack installed.  I was hoping that I'd be able to remove the long arms that come off easily and be able to access the tailgate, but even with only the base attached, the spare tire won't clear the short arms that are on the base.  It's not a big enough problem for me to return the whole rack, but if I was shopping for a new rack now I would spend a bit more $$$ for a rack that can pivot away from the tailgate.<br /><br />Aside from those issues, I like the way the rack hangs the bike via the wheels and it generally feels very solid.
B0084LT9YU|5|Love them. Easy install. Works great! Arrived early
B00L9FSOLC|5|These worked fabulous.  I did break one on the way out, so I purchased and used the Lisle (LIS65600), which I bought here on Amazon, an that worked great as well.  I also bought the CTA Tools 2385 9/16&#34; wrench which was a life saver....Its magnetic!
B000C2OD2M|5|Ok
B007OX6E3S|5|Worked perfectly
B00WVJR0D8|5|hey are this LED fit on an acura integra 96 low beam???
B000CFVMH8|4|Overall a decent OEM replacement. A few differences from the original, had to cut off a couple of extra/intrusive tabs but otherwise, fit perfectly.
B002T07C82|5|Good
B002C3Q2XW|5|my honda drives so much better around corners, handles really good.
B00F8NU9PK|5|Exactly what my dodge needed
B007553AE6|1|What a piece... Totally not what I expected
B00KJ8JVUI|5|Good looking lights. They're bright and well worth the money. bulb expectancy life is a little short but so far everything works fine.
B004SCETXU|1|Very unclear what is included in this product. I thought the item could be attached to the car with this product, but you need additional products.
B00AHJZBCG|5|Great lite. Cpact and plenty or power.
B004HOTSQW|5|Good
B004BRU18E|5|Edge Tech Support was great, installation was fairly straight-forward, just make sure you follow the instructions. Seemed to help my truck's funky shifting and the add on feature for a backup camera is an extremely nice touch. My truck is a 2004 Ram 2500 5.9L
B009Z3SQ90|5|Great!
B007RSGT1M|5|Great! Perfect fit!
B008HU8FV6|5|These are durable and well built units.
B001P2H4U6|2|Do not waste your money on this bulbar made by Westin.  It is nothing more than a decorative piece made in China you can buy the same thing for $130 on Amazon or eBay.  It is very pretty but that's all it would not stand up too much of a blow rather than being called a bull bar it should maybe be called a decorative bar.  Directions state that the fasteners are<br /> Stainless steel and they're not stainless steel.  Place the fasteners in a magnetic tray and they stick like glue.
B001RPG6IM|5|Worked great and saved me a whole lot of money!
B003U7ZYBU|5|awesome !! makes cleaning so much easier
B00BK7LYSY|5|Nice
B000GZLKEO|5|Great product!!
B00VDHJLWW|2|Pockets aren't as deep as they look and it doesn't sit flat against the seat back. The ends of the ties snapped off when I was attaching then.
B00DLMQHX8|4|bought this product for my 2016 CX-5 touring. Although amazon is adamant that this product does not fit the 2016 model...it does! and perfectly at that. I have bought weather tech before, but saw this product was cheaper with good reviews, so I thought I would give it a try. I like it, but I will say that I think the weathertech is more of a heavy-duty product than this. On my old car, I would remove my weathertech floor mats and use the power washer at the car wash to clean them without any problems......I wouldn't dare do that with these though as they are not 100% rubber like the weathertech version.
B0077A6F32|5|These also keep the heat out
B0033YFEQA|5|Had the problem yet With it  I Bought it and it installed like it was supposed to.
B00Z2CXQH0|5|Worked great
B000C9QU5I|5|Received on time and fit great . No problems.
B000MW91RE|5|i used for my headlight and it's clan it.
B001FBQOXU|5|I prefer this to WD-40. Royal Purple products are , IMO, some of the best available. I've sprayed this product on rusted metal, padlocks and door hinges. Works every time.
B010W2NVFG|5|Exactly what I neededm fast shipping.
B0093WAJ02|4|Manufacturing tolerances and finish are OK.  Not a work of beauty but serviceable.  I like the design.
B00PJPHEBO|2|This device worked perfectly for about three months after receiving in the mail. All of a sudden it would not connect to my cell phone. I have used multiple devices and it is not recognized by any OBD program.
B009BNFXZY|5|fit for my car
B004P5Z3B2|5|It does the job! The best way to fix a stripped out head bolt.
B00D3QQUGG|5|These have been perfect for my mom and sister when she was learning to drive. It also kept other drivers from tailing and honking at her, which helped in her confidence. She would not drive without them on the car.
B0000AY4MK|3|The hitch step is not what I expected, the details are not there, it is not a finished product with clean finished details,  but rather put together  poorly and with materials not quite upto part, it will work, but nothing to write home about.
B00D8FUM8E|5|Seems to be good quality, only used twice so far, but are holding up well.
B006GFO9WI|5|I love this thing send me another one in blue
B00IB1X73M|5|Easy to install!
B001CF1A6U|4|These things are no joke.  Seriously heavy duty.
B000QUXYXE|5|Perfect fit, easy install. They work great.  Great price as well.
B00HYIG6OA|5|great product I just got the wrong one.  I would recommend this for the right model tho
B005OUWQH6|5|Not much to say, perfect replacement in my 2000 Saturn SL2. It comes packaged with the ends covered in caps. The o-rings are included. If you're doing the same car as mine, do yourself a favor and remove not only the left headlight, but also the bracket that holds the headlight. There is a n access hole in the bracket, but it's like 500 times easier to work the hose into the fitting on the condenser without that bracket in the way.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent product!  Fits my 2009 Jeep Patriot windshield very well. The excess material around the rings allows me to cover every nook and cranny dramatically decreasing the temperature in my car after sitting out in the sun all day. Recommend it for all!!
B00ANWV4WI|4|They are a little bit looser than I was hopeing, however Iam satisfied with my purchase ...
B006OQ35GU|4|Works great
B003KFLETI|5|worked well
B00W9OQRH0|1|poor light, not lummens what the description says, totally dissapointment, DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY THIS LIGHT BAR SUCK!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Perfect for the Texas heat.
B0007VS2PW|5|Great car-wash and fast delivery. Will definitely order again. A little goes a long way
B006K8VIAM|4|Used almost the entire content in four tires on a Travel Camper.
B00CXTMKIQ|4|bright bright bright!!!
B0031XDVF4|5|Great product and works well. Made the fridge work.
B00LNDZ9GS|5|Fit and worked perfectly, except the wires come out at one end instead of the center.  I was easily able to modify the trailer to allow for this though.  Great price!
B00KTJ1PLU|5|Works just like the original
B00D329B8Y|5|I have a Dodge Magnum and these mats fit perfectly inside my card. I really like these mats because they are truly heavy duty mats. These are not the cheap mats made out of flimsy material that tears easily, not these are heavy duty mats. They are heavy and it will be very hard to tear these mats. My mats are grey. They have ridges in them that actually gets the dirt and rocks off the bottom of your shoes. The dirt and rocks drop down inside the ridges of the mats and keeps the rug around the mat clean. My original mats that came with my car had carpet on the top and it was difficult to keep it clean. It also had been worn out from normal wear and tear. With these mats all you have to do is take them out and shake them to remove the dirt and rocks that has accumulated. Each mat fits perfectly inside my car. I absolutely love using these mats and I would honestly recommend them. You will not be disappointed. When I received them I had to cut the rubber strip at the top off and that was all I had to do to these mats. I am so glad that I was able to get these mats for a great price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
B00GEIIPZ4|5|i order two kit and all of them work .
B001FSESYU|2|Although amazon says it fits acura tl, it doesn't fit.
B006WEFFP8|1|The thing is this, I called them before I purchased the unit, and researched it thoroughly. I am leaving to go out of state tomorrow and so I next day air this from Amazon so that I could reprogram my truck as I just installed much larger tires. Easy as 1234, easy as 1234, easy as 1234. Even though I called them twice and told them I have the 2015 Duramax I was told not going to be an issue easy as 1234...<br /><br />Well guess what? It wasn't as easy as 1234! Evidently the sequence code is not found in my truck and they have to forward this code to the advisement team and produce a special code for me and this takes &#34;2-3&#34; business days. Problem is once I am traveling out of state I'm not exactly going to have access to a computer somewhere to download the software to update this thing. I called and explain this to them, ask them if they could put a rush on it, but honestly, they didn't seem to care.<br /><br />I was also told that this is a very common problem and it happens all the time??? What???? It is??? Well what happened to easy as 1234 when I called before purchasing the unit?<br /><br />No where do you find in their instructions or website that the possibility exists that your code would not be found and it will take them several days to figure one out for you!!!!
B00H5A4F22|1|The thing is sucks, I put it on and take out one time one side of the spring handle it's already broken.<br />When I just got it , I was gonna return it. But cost me about $8 to return, It's not worth it. So I'll keep it.<br />I try to take out to put on my other car. Than is broken.<br />Cheap quality, don't buy
B00BFLVSIQ|5|I purchased this ACDelco Battery for my husband's '06 Honda Shadow Spirit 750.  It was a little bit of a tight squeeze but he was able to get it in and hooked up.  it works perfectly.  You have to prep the battery yourself by pouring the acid into the battery as indicated by the instructions that come along with it.
B00O83N0WA|5|Very nice and bright. Good weatherstripping. I even put a small amount of silicone caulk on the stripping and it seals just fine
B00KLKJNWU|5|It came quickly and worked great. Just hooked it up and ran it.
B00R6S0MEI|3|This is a heavy duty nozzle and will last for years. Very well made. It can produce a reasonably powerful spray with standard house pressure. It would be really good for washing vehicles.<br />The downside for me is the low pressure spray for plant watering. It still has a lot of force at it lowest spray point which might work for some users, but it really wasn't what I had hoped for.
B00GHKMKT6|5|Original Honda part. Exact fit for my 2007 Acura TL. Very easy installation.
B00T7GYAWW|5|Awesome!!!<br />This is the 2nd one I've bought for two different side by sides. We love them. They are as bright as they say. And might buy one more. 👍🏼😀
B000G72UOQ|2|I ordered this one expecting mylar shiny shades. I received the duller gray option, which I am very disappointed with. I ordered wanting the shinier mylar because, in my opinion, they reflect the sun better. I am upset that I received the dull gray but will keep them and use them since I'm stuck with them. I think that Amazon should offer a choice since there are two color options. I will not be ordering this item again unless I can choose the mylar.
B00SBZRKEU|3|Been having a little problem with it. Will try to see what I am doing wrong
B0077T23EI|5|Great stand for your bike!
B00B4E9S9A|2|As noted by Jason R, item sent is not what was pictured.  IS NOT GM OEM part.  Part I recv'd has a rounded &#34;S&#34;, not squared & the &#34;R&#34; has a wing on the top left corner.  Item appears to be fairly sturdy metal, NOT in GM packaging.
B000BKEBO0|5|Had a leak above windshield due to the sun and weather. So far it's working great.
B00LW6V1CC|5|Love it!
B00IZNZOYQ|5|Totally great fits my 2009 Prius perfectly and makes oil changes quick and easy. I wish the wrench I got for my 6 cylinder fit this good
B009DJQX0U|5|Looks incredible! Easy installation, only took 30 minutes with a 10mm wrench and a screwdriver. Very happy with this product.
B001JK5YRO|5|Time-serts are the best way to go. We use them on Harley repairs.
B0087ZTEBG|5|excellent
B001PWA0IO|5|cheap and its neat... can drop the tailgate down while standing in the bed now... makes people look twice when its slowly lowering... pretty neat
B00DSD79JQ|5|Quality Sticker, easy application.  I recommend it.
B000VAW1NS|5|Much weaker plastic than I imagined, but they ARE cheap afterall, and guess they don't need to be very tough. 10/10 would buy again.
B00BUN6T0Q|1|Did not fit correctly, took way too long to get to me, so long I don't even want to attempt exchanging. Not happy at all with this product. Wouldnt of even gave it a star but had to to write this reiew.
B00KAPYM1I|5|Works awesome in the mist
B0006IX850|5|Makes loading water into the tank a lot easier.
B00PCI3MXW|5|He will love it.
B001SG99O8|3|Fit well on my mustang gt 2003 makes a bit of noise when it turns on but overall for the price does what it needs to still haven't taking it for a long road trip but in time I'll update!
B00BITHKD2|5|Great color match and ease of installation
B003V57NUQ|1|cheap quality, it's NOT universal fit. spend extra $$ and get name brand product (I'll try thule)
B0053I3GOQ|5|Great product fast shipping
B000CSEUPG|4|Traps the crud, not sure what else to say.
B00EECM5FI|5|well pleased with the product
B00G620ZVU|4|Very bright
B005VLXNVQ|5|Lake other reviewer's have already stated I was able to install this and literally under 30 seconds definitely recommend getting OEM
B0033YECEK|5|Been for couple months now ! Been working pretty good !
B000C59WC0|5|You will have to install the grease fitting and the hole is not threaded. Not much trouble to use the fitting to cut the threads but getting it started can make you say some new words. The ball/head is larger than OEM but the tapper shank is direct fit, this must be a problem they solved (hints problem solver). The larger ball must provide more surface and some other stuff, just remember to pack it with grease after installing it.<br />If you are doing what I did and bought Tie Rod End boots to replace the rubber style with poly then you need to get these and measure first. Energy Suspension part 9.13102R does not fit. Even though they would fit my OEM rods.
B00MBBK0CO|5|love it...
B00029XHS6|5|This is a sweet air horn set, nothing like the old Italian made horns which I had back in the 70's but this is all plastic and very light weight.<br /><br />I have no problem with the material and the setup is very easy. Don't worry about the turkey stuff, that's just marketing guff, it is not really like a turkey but it is different to anything else you may have heard. And you can easily switch it back to the single trumpet sound, man is it loud.<br /><br />The only thing to keep in mind is the hose supplied is fine if the compressor and horns are in close proximity to each other but in my case I have the horns behind the grille and the compressor in the engine bay. Easy fix, just buy a roll of 8mm clear hose for under 10 bucks and you are done.<br /><br />I also mounted my compressor on a RAM mount with a short arm, that was a great idea. Here is a link:<br />http://www.amazon.com/RAM-Mounts-RAM-B-238-2-43-Diamond/dp/B002KO5XVU/ref=pd_sim_422_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=063W0DFNBCYFHAYVV9WG<br /><br />Graeme
B00IO96QM0|5|Great quality and easy to install.  All the parts fit perfectly - just as expected.  I recommend this kit for any DIY brake job.
B001FAIA0Q|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B00AMLQ74K|5|I just put these on today and am extremely happy with them so far. The install took me just over an hour (thanks to the other reviewers for advising us to swap the rear driver bracket with the rear passenger bracket). Instructions aren't the best but this is a pretty straight forward install.  I'm happy with the look of them. For under $200, I never expected them to look as quality and durable as they do. I expect to have to tighten the bolts every now and then, but with the lock washers, maybe not.. these things should last a while.   ***UPDATE*** I've had these one for about a week now and the only thing I would complain about is that the steps sit real close to the truck. I didn't really notice it until the wife asked if we could adjust them so they sit about 6&#34; further out from the truck. This would make them more practical for actually stepping up on. Other than that, they look good.
B00PGCDBCG|5|The boards went on with no problem. Look good on my truck. I would recommend for someone looking for running boards but are on a budget like me.
B000BG1X54|5|Couldn't believe it works just like the video. Saves a LOT of work fueling my pontoon boat.

B00ZOKJVAG|5|Easy to apply, working great!
B00H7LPKKU|5|I've only used this once so far too grease my construction equipment and all I can say is I should have bought one a long time ago.  Worked great with virtually no wasted grease on fittings that previously wouldn't take grease without oozing out everywhere.
B00JJ66MZS|4|Good product for the price.
B00KQT2F4E|5|works well, as advertised.  Happy.  Altho a wiring diagram would have been helpful, but, no problems at all.
B000GU7I72|2|Thin material. But it was cheap. You get what you pay for. Fortunately, I suspected as much when I bought it, so I wasn't surprised. Would be fine for indoor use to keep dust off, but I don't think it will stand up terribly long in the sun. Time will tell!
B000EDOSKG|5|excelent product  .
B000QJG1IA|5|awesome price from this srller compared to others....same muffler...does what its suppose to:)
B003ASHIJK|5|Great for added support with the plug tire patch.

B00EP3PQMU|5|Great! Delivery was super fast!
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Works great&#62; Exactly what I was hoping for. insulated, I put wipes instead of Kleenex at the bottom and it holds it perfectly.
B009D2E822|5|100 % recomendable
B00AYA3Q0M|5|Bought for 2015 Tacoma DCSB TRD OR. Excellent fit and great quality. Little pricy but worth in my opinion.
B0095GNVMY|5|Was what my husband wanted
B000EDST1K|4|I love this for the rv stovetop but the backing is coming off so will have to glue it!!
B000EQUVWW|5|Fast delivery, perfect look. Only wish the screws would be included.
B001PYNX0O|5|love it - very heavy duty - may be better than the original part
B00KFVXW7M|2|While it comes with the O-ring there was no gasket.  This didn't solve my problem
B000GTWQTI|5|What I expected
B000CNBCB6|4|Does exactly what its supposed to..
B00WJ0LFXK|1|This does not fit the 2011 Chevy Silverado 1500 as advertised.  The listing should be updated to show models that can be modified to add a cabin air filter using this kit.
B00EUN9KP4|5|Looks great and I am happy with the quality.
B00851QMVM|5|Replaced the old, hot, and extremely inefficient energy using incandescent bulb on my RV.  This new LED is cool when I touch the light housing and looks and runs great. I would highly recommend it.
B00CO6PYNQ|5|I have yet to use this but was pleasantly surprised at the quality from a visual inspection. The piece is bigger than I assumed it would be and very solid and hefty. It is pictured accurately and the weight alone leads me to believe it will be a solid tool to use.
B003CGDPVK|5|Bought this for my 97 TJ and am not disappointed!  It took me about 15 mins to put this on the first time.  Im not sure how some of the othet reviewers &#34;ripped&#34; their tops.  This thing is tight! Very very tight fitting.  I had to pull pretty hard the first time putting it on and I never thought once ot was going to rip.  Seems to block out wimd noise amd doesnt make any glapping noise at all.  I use it along woth a bestop standard mesh bikini top and they both strap up very well next to each other.  Best 100 bucks Ive spent on the Jeep in a while.
B00K971X8M|1|Beware, it just a piece of leather.No plastic mold,No glue.The photo is what it should look like after you've worked hard and did all the work.If you got to do 90% of job, just go to a leather shop.
B001O7PNNM|5|excellent product
B00DP5UL7Y|5|Great!
B000CSPDES|4|Not for club cab (extended cab) they are for the 4 door quad cab with full size rear doors
B00BQHABMS|5|Just what I needed
B004M21WUO|5|Perfect fit. Very easy to install with the proper tools. I did not remove my wheels.
B000RN4OG6|4|Item arrived on time.  The picture is better than the image shows.  The item is made of very thin tin
B00032K4FG|5|Not to dark, but not to light
B00Q1F6LC4|5|It was great
B004WO9RZE|1|Don't waste your money I have bought 20 dollar shocks that outperform these tubes of hype
B0041C1BOW|5|Not having to hold two buttons down while the top goes up, and to be able to put the top up when the car is moving is worth the price! It's a must have for all you Mazda PRHT owners!
B001AWLTX4|3|doesnt fit quite like i wanted, but good enough
B00139WO9C|4|does what it is supposed to
B00480J4JG|5|Great replacement for my g35 and what a great price the dealer wanted $$$.  Thanks amazon.  Also the are the same thing that came from factory.
B002ZBWKAU|4|Very nice
B00BD5GT9W|4|Front seat covers fit perfect.  Back?  No.  I have a Mitsubishi Mirage, with a 60/40 split back seat.  Back seat covers do not work.  BUT!  This company is absolutely awesome.  We worked out who to make it work.  Super nice folks work here and go above and beyond to help you any way they can.  I will surely do business with them again.
B0001CMUV4|5|OF ALL THE HITCH TIGHTENER,S AND ANTI WOOBLE BOX,S THIS ONE IS EASY TO INSTALL AND WORKS GREAT
B000CGWM1M|5|They are red and poly what else is there to it? You'll get what you see.
B00BTLEIIY|1|If I could give it less I would. The option to select what year and model of your car lures you into a false sense of comfort about purchasing these. The pieces that were supposed to fit the headrests were not at all like they were supposed to be. Overall. Hate it
B003VAWUKE|5|Works perfectly. Cheaper then in stores here.
B000BOZVW2|3|Bought this to replace a leaking Gentex auto-dimming mirror in the wife's 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse. I actually wanted another auto-dimming mirror, but no one currently offers one WITH map lights (like her original), but without compass and outside temp features. Her car has both those features built-in, so they would have been redundant on the mirror. This mirror, of course, dims manually via a flip lever, which, by the way, I find unusually and unnecessarily large/long. The mirror itself is also somewhat narrower than the original, but not to the point of being unusable. This mirror fits her car's wedge mount perfectly. In fact, the original mirror had a spring clip that, had it not been for some successful internet research, I would never have figured out how to remove the thing. This replacement mirror uses an easily accessible star-head screw to secure it to the windshield mount, which I much prefer over the clip type. On the down-side, this mirror is very light weight - it simply does not have a quality feel to it. I suppose that may be due to the absence of the auto-dimming components, but it still feels cheap. Aside from all that, it was an excellent buy, and above all, it doesn't leak!!. I paid less than half the price quoted for the same piece on all other websites, so I highly recommend this item from this seller.<br /><br />NOTE  -<br />If you don't find this review helpful, please leave a comment and tell me why. If for some reason you simply don't like it, I challenge you to write a better one.equirements. God protect our whole society from the terminally helpless among us!  Edit 10/27/2015 After living with this thing for a while, I'm very disappointed in it. In day mode, the mirror is extremely dim and blurry, and it has a noticeable green tint to it. A quick glance at it doesn't communicate a clear image of vehicles behind me. Night mode also has a green tint, but it isn't quite so noticeable. I've docked it two more stars because of the very poor reflected image.  I would not recommend this mirror to anyone!
B001CHEMCW|1|Cheap piece of junk, broke off in the cylinder head, metal is very thin and cheap. Now I have to remove the cylinder head and drill it out.
B000GU23VS|5|Arrived quickly and as described, thanks!
B002NFI4IU|5|quick, easy, and so perfect for my needs.
B00VJIF3GI|5|Got this as a little gift for my boyfriend- he loves, and so do I!<br />Perfect size, too.
B007TY7QXO|5|I ordered tail lights on a Tuesday night. I expected the arrival for the next week. I was surprised and ecstatic to see them on my door step as I was leaving for work on Thursday morning (I leave around 10:45 am). My cousin installed them the same day and I was able to get my inspection sticker (I had my old driver's taillight wastaped on which obviously failed the safety portion. The passenger side just had an annoying crack that water would get into). It may sound strange but I'm just really excited that I don't have to drive around with a taped up car and I can now go through an automatic car wash and not have to wash it by hand.
B00HGMZZOQ|3|Before I purchased this, I checked using the Amazon 'garage' section, and was told that this would fit my 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara rear spare...well it sort of fits.  It is just a bit small so the bottom is puckered and when trying to pull it on it actually tore a bit.  When it started tearing I stopped pulling, not wanting to ruin it as I am okay with it not being perfect, it being a temp cover for my vehicle.  However, what upsets me is that I was told it was a fit for my vehicle and it's not, Amazon unfortunately needs to step up their game on things like this.  I love Amazon and will keep using them, but if they are going to promise customers the 'perfect fit' or 'compatibility' they need to be sure they are accurate.
B002GQEZH0|1|left one star only because I can't leave zero. This thing is worthless. It broke the first time I tried to use it. Don't waste your time. The fingers that hold the valve spring cup tore before the spring even moved. I was using it on an old jeep valve. There is nothing that states spring weight limits and I can open these valves slightly by hand. Tool just is cheaply made and sucks. I hope I can get my money back because I sure as heck won't be getting back the five days I had to wait for it even with so called prime shipping.
B003AYLF52|5|Great fitment and sounds good
B00VR6ZXR6|5|Just what a needed to get the bletcherous dealer frame off my car.
B002KCE6LU|5|Awesome--allowing you to check air pressure, inflate OR deflate in 1 attachment!
B002GTKAHQ|4|As expected<br />Fast arrival. Good price!
B000CQVQN2|4|1500 miles so far so good no squeaking and sure steady stops.
B0010VNLK4|4|good plugs
B003CJFJGG|5|PArts arrived in good condition-exactly like described! Thanks
B00AK698DY|5|Nice bag. Good quality, looks great on my iron 883.
B000765MHI|3|Loud
B000BZZSCO|5|Perfect for my Wives 03 Escape. Bought the rotors and pad here cheaper than I could buy just the rotors local.
B00OZDOTZA|2|The package comes with no manual setup or manual, so you must figure out how to install and how to use it .<br /><br />The sensors do not always work , sometimes you need to switch between &#34; D &#34; and &#34; R &#34; several times to work .<br /><br />Mirror screen always stays on which is quite annoying because you have to turn it off manually
B007ZVLS3A|5|Love it!
B00VIWJV7W|5|Cute...he loved it! Easy install
B00S1KH5QI|5|Excellent product, saved a lot of money over other options.  Works great.
B0052UB5DY|5|This was easy to program. The instructions were easy to follow. Although, I also watched a video online to be sure that I did it correctly. It works great. I would recommend this product and purchase it again if need be.
B00OB39EZO|1|I opened the packet and took out the turbo and fell apart on my hand I want a replacement or my money back
B00KTHXYO8|1|It was not the stuff I was watingin for.
B00AMLQ8TE|5|Perfect fit, took no time and fit and they look great
B00MB0E1ZC|2|Good product, thanks!<br /><br />Initially this was a good product. But, after a month using this for my honda civic, it became defective.<br />The steering wheel cover is now lop-sided and cracking around the inside elastic, requiring me to invest in a new one at this time.
B000VKTUE6|4|Fit my wifes element perfect, they were a tad flimsy but buying these was wayyyyyyy cheaper than having a shop do it and I am sure these will work just as long as the stock ones did.
B002NBSQ78|5|Perfect fit replacement.  and it's a WIX, 'nuff said.
B005H6W05K|5|Incredible difference compared to old cracked glazed over factory headlights.<br />Lots of raves from other motorists. Now I have to paint my car to deserve having these .<br />Easy to install, especially if You follow the directions.
B00K3M88NQ|5|I bought this for my boyfriend, who recently purchased a lotus. Needless to say, he loves it.<br /><br />Color: white and bright red, just like screen.<br />Quality: I thought it was going to be a thin metal material but it was a super thick plastic. Perfect for the garage.
B00IRPPZQO|4|great for the price.  does streak a bit but you get what you pay for
B00CYLWV6E|5|I use after workouts and tennis.  It is absorbent and easy to attach.
B00MO9T9SE|5|works as advertised.
B00AJWBQSY|5|Fits our Model S perfectly.  Rolls up easily and stays closed with a velcro strap.
B000FQ1XUU|1|Not as pictured
B00KBBL4H6|5|Fast shipping and works for both our bikes and cars
B00063073Q|5|Needed the adapter on my 2000 Dakota 5.9 Quad Cab 4x4. But with that, the truck has been running fine.
B001OCTKEA|4|A great box. I would've given 5 stars had it come with the seal for the lid as it said in the description when i bought it. Other then that one problem its a perfect box.
B000C2U7M2|5|didn't have problem installing. works fine.
B004MED2TQ|1|Was told by Mishimoto this was the part number needed for a 2.5&#34; Hose, as it should've extended past 2.5 and down. It doesn't. Can't fit it on a 2.5&#34; hose.
B00AQI8SH8|5|Perfect fit - it took a minute to figure out the cover is what holds the visor clips in place.  It took about 2 minutes to swap out.
B00LNNJ1G2|5|Great product, follow directions provided..
B0045IBCGE|1|Not worth the money
B003SS62PS|5|I bought 2 of these and put them in my aluminum fishing boat. thaey clip on the sides and keep a nice lil breeze blowin on them hot summer days
B00V337VNC|5|Look great on my wife's car
B00VN3J8OM|1|Got the item an plugged it in. Lasted a day then melted. Idk if it was faulty but it did work just for that initial day
B000E4IGL2|5|Solved my problem at a reasonable cost.  Youtube videos made the installation process easy.
B00MPQ3CZ2|5|Received the Hitch on 08/05/2015 and immediately hooked it up to the tractor and moved our loaded 16 foot utility trailer without any problems.  This hitch worked exactly as I expected and is a great time saver.  However, the same product, by the same seller (Titan Attachments) was for sale on ebay at $109.00 - including free shipping.  I paid $121.00 on Amazon.  I'm happy with the product.  Jim Amundson
B0054RGL0W|5|Great product, however it just wont work for my 2015 Genesis Sedan.  I knew when purchasing it, that is for the coupe.  However no one offered this kit for the sedan, so I figured Id give it a try, because I figured at least the threading would be correct.  I was hoping that if anything it would be too short and Id have to create an extension....So it fits, but unfortunately it sticks out about 2.25&#34; too far.  I emailed Grimmspeed to see if they have a shorter option but have not heard back.  If not I will have to see if I can modify what I have or have a new post custom made to fit the rest of the great grimmspeed hardware.
B007TYQUZO|5|Perfect fit.  Just needed to paint it to match. Super quick delivery
B00A3V3DLY|2|Brake drum did not fit over these shoes. Would recommend just buying the EBC pads instead
B000BKC25K|1|use rust mort
B00RW4K8R2|5|These fit my 2012 Chevy Traverse perfectly!  Very easy to put on also.  Very good deal!
B000GKD5NI|3|I bought this knowing from previous reviews that the suction cups would not be the best, and would likely need to be replaced with something from the hardware store. So I went to the hardware store and bought a decent set of suction cups (not cheap-o ones)...but the darn thing keeps falling down! Usually within 4-5 hours of attachment, but always within 24 hours of attachment, the screen falls down.<br /><br />It is great for filtering the sun, and I could see through it fine to look in my rearview mirror for traffic behind me. But it falls down. Sometimes while driving. Sometimes while stopped.<br /><br />If the suction cups weren't an issue, this would be a 5 star product.
B002MB8TQ2|5|Not bad,looks good
B008NG9TGE|5|It arrived as described
B00BSEZIQI|5|Great price
B0031GAJC4|5|Works perfectly, easy to install.  My vehicle is a 2006 XC90.  The only hard part is getting to the light connectors inside the access panels at the corners of the car, especially since you can't see them.  Explore with your finger directly behind the trim panel where the seat belt rollers are mounted and you'll feel them.  With a flashlight and a mirror or the front-facing camera on your phone you can see where they are behind the trim panel to help get you started.  Feel around with your finger on the back of the light connector next to the car's sheet metal and you'll feel a thin flexible circular plastic disk which is the flange of the plastic pin holding the connector in place on the wall.  Pry that disk with your finger and the pin easily pops out of the hole it's in.  There is a little locking latch on the connectors to get them separated so that you can insert the T-connector of the Curt unit.  When you've got the new connectors in place, it takes a little dexterity to feel for the hole and get the mounting pin pushed back into the wall, but try to do this if you can.  You want to minimize the strain on the wiring going out to the tail light assembly.  I played it safe and disconnected the negative lead of the battery (10 mm wrench) to de-energize the car before connecting the main power lead of the Curt unit to the power feed on the fuse block.  Without doing that, know that you will be in contact with a live 12V line from the battery and you DO NOT want to accidentally touch that to the vehicle ground either directly (if you pull the existing wire off the post) or by bridging it with one of your tools!  Plus these Volvos are so full of electronic control systems I didn't want to risk a static spike blowing up one of those modules.  The only downside to disconnecting the battery is that I had to reset the clock in the instrument panel.  I tucked the Curt unit between the vehicle body and that big wiring bundle at the bottom of the access hatch.  No need forthe adhesive which most people say doesn't hold anyway.  I have the 4-pin plug to the trailer going through the tailgate for now, but intend to cut and reconnect these four wires using butt splices after routing the cable underneath the vehicle through one of those oval-shaped rubber plugs you will see in the floor of the vehicle body next to the battery.
B0088F7J1C|5|This stuff is truly neat.  Easy application, with spares in case you mess up, which is nearly impossible.  Bought this for a motorcycle project, but now I'm thinking the blue would look really sweet on my car!
B00JIJ4LWW|4|Seems to do a quality job leaving the leather (sofa in our case) soft and clean.  I would like a fresher fragrance.
B001AVSIOI|1|I bought this locking hitch pin in January and put the hitch on my truck. Recently I tried to unlock it to replace the 2&#34; hitch with a 1 7/8&#34; hitch. The lock is completely frozen up. No amount of WD-40 has been able to free it. Very poor quality to have seized up after 6 months of use. During the winter I did find that the cover frequently came off the lock and had to be replaced, it is too loose to be able to protect the lock which I'm sure contributed to the issue. Now I'm forced to try and cut the lock off so I can replace it.
B004CIMKQI|5|Awesome.  Easy to install, works great, only one question- why so many power settings?  #6 is all you really need unless you are letting your teen drive your truck.  Much more power AND better fuel economy- IF you can keep your foot out of it!  (and trust me, it is hard to do...)
B002W2V19I|5|Holds a ton of keys. Very sturdy
B007JSGR9Y|5|Works well, does all I needed it to do, Simple and easy to use!
B0068EQCPO|5|Very pleased
B00CQ8NF7E|1|I loved it... But it broke in less than a week and I barely used it.
B00KPWBDZY|5|Worked great
B004ETGQKG|5|Fits car well.  Haven't used it yet because it hasn't snowed yet.
B005J1UK2I|5|Like others are saying -- these are superior in strength, quality, and price. Don't be tempted to save a few bucks. You will be amazed at the quality of these jacks.<br />NOW - for how I installed these.<br />I used a grinder to removed all the old cheap hardware from the originals which were rusted plenty after only 2 years. The Husky bracket fit where the originals were mounted, although I had to make the mounting holes bigger. Everything is bigger on the Husky jack except the overall size, and the quality of materials is excellent.  I thoroughly greased and oiled every nut and bolt before mounting the jack to the frame using 1 1/4 inch 3/4 diameter stainless steel bolts. You could use a cheaper bolt, but I thought the stainless provided an extra measure of durability. Also - if they become damaged during travels, I know I can replaced them by simply unfastening the mounting bolts and putting on replacements.<br />The easiest way to mount them after the holes are drilled is to extend the jack so it rests against the trailer frame.<br />Hope this helps.
B007USCMJM|5|Very high quality.
B00BB12AAK|5|Hay with purchase
B000PGXQNC|5|Very nice replacement.
B000GTZC8K|5|I purchased both left and right. Installed on a 2001 Suzuki marauder look great installed easy. Called seller direct to to double check to make sure that they came with the equipment to install on a metric cruiser as well as a Harley was surprised when they returned my call so quickly with an answer
B00EPA7BXU|5|What a difference.  The lights are very bright. Looks like daytime when they are on.  Super price too!
B0002SQVX0|5|Works well excellent product.
B001PWA0IO|1|Great idea works well when it will stay attached to the tailgate end. Keeps coming loose off the tailgate.   Edit:  As stated before good but not great. Finally the pin attached to the tailgate finally came off and is stripped out rendering it useless.
B00EA2DPN8|4|not too shabby
B00192JF9U|4|As a new RV'er I wanted to ensure that my new Class A didn't suffer from some of the issues on the units on dealers' lots with water heaters and furnaces crammed full of wasp nests.  This does the job extremely well.  The only reason that I did not give it a 5 star rating is because of the spring installation method.  I fiddled with it for nearly an hour and finally gave up and installed it with galvanized lock wire (.032 works well).
B002I9OQGK|5|Cute for a Jeep lover!
B006STTIVY|1|The connection from my hose to this nozzle is loose and water leaks out everywhere. I am not happy with this product at all and do not recommend it, even if it is inexpensive, because it is practically useless.
B005FKMQDO|4|Purchased these to replace warped rotors in my 03 Honda Accord. These brakes are SMOOTH and the stopping power is amazing. Highly recommended.
B001AWLWYK|4|Other than the wires being color coded Backwards as compared to my Harley, this is a great product at a Great price.
B006H33ZU6|5|So, I got the spots on accident instead of the driving beams. My fault, the spots still easily overpower my stock headlights and fog lights.<br /><br />In other words, it does what it's suppose to. I've driven cross country 3 times already with them, no issues. Works like a charm in Kansas hail storms and Montana blizzards.
B004GCM9V6|5|Perfect fit. Just what I wanted and at a great price! Quick shipping. I strongly recommend this seller!!!
B005JVF98S|5|They were exactly as stated and worked perfect
B003C016XA|1|The title says plug and bung, but we also only received one part of this.  We also paid for 1-day shipping, so we were counting on receiving the complete part.  Had to request a refund.  I wouldn't count on this being what you want, if you need both plug and bung.
B003VLBPJA|3|Stretched after about a few weeks of use, but still works. These nets help save a lot of time on securing lunch bags etc on my Harley.  For the price I would buy another one.  Shipping was forever and a day, so if that is a concern...
B00SZNGNGO|5|Changes the look of my car.eazy to install
B000WFARHE|4|it works pretty good
B004NFXA7I|4|Does not come with instructions on how to properly apply. Other than that, super easy to do (once instructions were looked up online), huge difference when driving in the rain. Will certainly be using these from now on.
B0049MX8N6|5|Fit like a glove,,nice
B0002MBKAA|5|My husband loved it. It fits well. Good quality and price. Thanks amazon
B000KYWY3C|5|Ordered this for our 1997 Ford F150 and it was so simple to program!  Turn from off to run 5 times, then push a button on the remote.  Push button again within 20 seconds and it was ready to go!!  Husband is thrilled, as we bought the truck used, and it didn't have a remote.
B001C9IQDQ|5|Works great. Arrived a day early.
B00295I6V4|5|Was exactly what I needed! Perfect fit!
B00CI1X0GA|2|Shipping was super fast, quality was ok also uneven. Wouldn't buy again.
B009DK5GW0|1|This head light panel in the photo was the exact same one, which I received. Compare it to the stock panel. It doesn't have the mounts for the turn signals or the proper square holes for the grill to attach.
B00BKT63X8|5|A truckers best friend, great atlas, highly recommend. It will keep you out of trouble so use it as a primary means of navigating.
B005NLQAHS|5|Worked great for stopping the backup beeper on my Prius 2010
B0006O2PBW|5|Great product. Arrived quickly and exactly as described. These are very potent, I recommend not taking out of the bag during the first couple days of use. It is almost overpowering. I use these in my home and cars. I put one in my boys room and it did wonders. It works much quicker and effectively than Febreeze or any of the plug in aromas and candles. If you need to get a room smelling better, go with the Little Trees, they work great.
B006MX81FA|1|They did not fit accordingly. Return was smooth and easy. No issues. Wish they fit well as it was a gift that could not be used. However, the material felt like great quality.
B000S6KI4O|3|had to do some adjustments to make it fit good
B000K8WYQA|5|Yes it did love it everyone around me that's a fan loves it I am a happy guy
B004A6M7E2|4|Perfect
B00TQ07IOQ|4|They were exactly what I was looking for for the most part. The materials were good, and the bottom of the mats had little spikes on them to keep them in place, and the top material was a fuzzy felt-type of material that's typical of car mats whether they come with the car or not. The reason I took off a star is because the two front mats didn't fit with my 04 Chevy Impala, even though amazon matched it with my car. The front mats needed to have a square cut out of both the top left corner of the drivers mat, and the top right corner of the front passenger mat.
B00F9O1PKG|1|Awful experience with these boots. First time I used them was my motorcycle class and one of the buckles didn't secure properly. Then after just 1 day and 20 miles of riding, the inner part of the boot ripped through from the shifter. Then on the second day the right boot ripped as well as one of the buckles came off. Do not buy. Piece of crap
B00BI8RXOY|3|DO NOT BUY THIS PART FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!! I bought this part thinking it would be closer to &#34;OE&#34; quality then the Dorman brand. When I got the switch and looked at it,plan as day it had the Dorman part # on the back. And of course they didn't show this in the picture!!!!! Just go ahead and order the Dorman part # 901-072 and save a few bucks. I WILL BE SENDING MINE BACK JUST BECAUSE OF THIS REASON!!!!!
B000GU0RGG|5|I just got this cover for my Suzuki V-Strom DL650 and it fits over my side cases quite easily. It would not if I had a rear case though, but for what I am doing, I am more than satisfied! Lets hope it stands the test of time.
B0002I94CK|4|Needed a replacement.
B004809YBE|5|Works like it should, great extra cord to have on hand when you need the extra reach.
B006GF8C9Y|3|Provides warmth only
B004HMBK5G|5|Easy to install and keeps the belt off my neck. Great price.
B0084UJKPY|5|Fits like a glove.  The rear is two small mats, not the one long one as shown.  I would have rather had the long one.  However, when the order said  &#34;4 piece&#34; I called them and they said it was 4 mats, not one long one, so I knew what I was getting.
B009RSU18C|5|Good purchase
B004QMD2JY|4|nice helmet, just doesnt fit my head. Racequip is not a sticker on the forehead so thats annoying.
B0044A30WW|5|Excellent
B002JH5W0A|5|Just what  I wanted. They look perfect for what I needed them for.
B00KARB6SS|5|We have used this before. Excellent product
B0076AKISQ|5|goes on easily, looks good, and has provided excellent protection from pet paws and cargo scrapes.
B007PVIARW|4|Works has a crease do to packaging but other then that it's great.
B000B68V6I|5|I suppose it worked...
B00RA4HOPI|5|Really bright. perfect !!!
B00DBMLY8G|5|Good welds works great.
B000VU91SG|5|Great bed liner.
B001SLAMSK|4|Awesome Buy
B0064P14HI|1|This is crap! Apparently I didn't get the mirrors that I read the reviews on. Many people spoke of two set screws at the base of the mirror. Mine have no such screws. I did not expect the quality to equal original equipment but I did expect the right mirror to be convex. I did not expect the image to be so distorted that you can't tell where objects are. I also expected the mounting screws to be the right thread. Had i tried to use them I may well have stripped the threads on my hinges creating a whole new problem.The product is worthless.<br />After printing a return label I see that postage is required. The product is defective. It should not cost me money to return it.Calling the supplier gets you voice mail, as yet unanswered. Never had a problem like this before with anything I bought from or through Amazon.<br />I advise steering clear of Best Price Mirror at all cost.
B00JC6K9M2|1|very poor the item was dried out and I could not use it
B003VASRCE|4|Works great.
B008YDD6J2|5|No complaints.  They were exactly what we expected them to be.
B00LOS152E|2|It Doesn't have holes for the screws, so you can't hold it on place nor can you ground it. Definitely doesn't look like in the picture.
B00EPDLCXM|5|Fits my 2008 Audi A4, for those who have the same.
B00KX0SDBA|1|It turns yellow after a month and YES the wheel center cap will fall out if you speed over 90 mph.... What a shame 😬😬
B00080QHMM|5|Very nice
B00U0GWJBM|5|Great value!
B004HCU77I|5|Great product.  Extremely satisfied with the shine left after a wash.  Tire shine gel lasts a solid two weeks with out disappearing.  I would suggest purchasing an extra drying towel as the one provided works well but only gets through about half of the car.  Have yet to use the wax, but I expect it will be equally as good as the rest of the package.
B009OFFI8Q|5|on time, perfect fit, easy install looks great, protects door from scuffs.
B005JHRMBO|4|For the price you cant do better....but for a little more you can do much better.
B00OMTAHYY|3|Lasted about 5 months. The color was great but didn't improve visibility much at all.
B00A93SNU2|5|Awesome hitch cover looks.great fits perfect shipping could have been faster
B00J4D518U|1|Didn't work at all when we hooked it up. Sorry. I will always give the benefit of the doubt. But it was torn up. Didn't even get to use it.  😞
B007ED84XG|5|I enjoy using this sunshade. I see people smiling at it when I am parked in public parking lots. It has little suction cups to help it stay up, but they seem to let go as soon as it gets about 90 or more. Still does the job.
B0029TQDLA|3|Gets too soft in the sun and falls off the mirror.
B005MZXWPI|5|Great price!
B003BZD08U|4|works good
B0045WBVUM|3|Mounted to the stock seat on my Harley Heritage Classic.  The pads literature claims &#34;up to 6-hours of riding&#34;. Although this pad does provide more comfort for longer trips, after about 3 hours of riding I still get a little monkey butt.  I've tried more air, less air, medium air - all to no avail.  I weight 193 pounds at 6'1&#34; and do have a little natural cushion in the seat.  Better than the stock seat alone, but not as advertised.
B00ITWYPTI|3|it doesnt actually look that small on my computer. it takes up the whole surface. but it still looks nice so im happy
B000C7VYVU|5|Fit as expected. Ordered with prime so shipping was fast. No issues with it yet.
B00TPQWQN4|1|Do not buy. They broke
B002TS923W|5|Good and fast shiping
B00VNBDWPK|2|These are advertised to be as bright as HID.  Not the case.  These are on Par with a good set of Halogens.  Hopefully they last a long time otherwise they will be a huge waste of money.
B005LJGSSS|3|just as advertised,but fades quickly
B000RXNLK6|5|excellent product
B005IV0PVA|2|A lot smaller than expected
B003AW28A0|5|Nice
B005AZ4M3Q|5|Best product ever when training house pets and if they have an accident.  Perfect clean up to get out of the carpet especially if you have little kids and do not want those stains or bacteria around.
B004GE6WYO|3|works good easy to find matching paint at auto parts store... much cheaper that dealer, but missing plastic connect clip, resolved with sticky foam....
B00XNXDR9W|5|Very good
B00B27KM12|4|It is a very good looking license plate frame with excellent finish including chrome finish buttons that fit over the screw heads. it adds elegance to my Hyundai Azera. That was the purpose of the purchase.
B00AEK55WY|4|Perfect for my project
B00358KE5U|5|Easy add on that looks unique and adds character to my bike.
B00L4V9ECY|4|Did the job for my LED bulbs - however, it would've been great to include instructions (hence the 4 star rating). took me about 15 minutes to google search the wiring diagram. to save everyone time, to wire this up you need to connect one end to the negative and the other to the positive.
B000COC67E|5|The creeper seat is perfect for those low position jobs or used as a great seat.
B0108WCVNI|5|It's the pride of the neighborhood
B000CGM1D6|5|OEM part.
B0012TTBO4|4|fit good
B00FZKHTOK|5|They look great in my bobber
B000ALG86E|5|Very good！
B002XLGR4W|5|Perfect fit
B00407RT8K|3|Wrong color
B00WNQGYHC|5|i think i will order another kit for my low beam (7000 lm) i order this for my fog light but until now i did not install it but i try it it's very shiny Update. ...! I install it.  And I am not expecting that  It's very bright  I will order another kit for sure
B004TOZRMO|5|Heavy Knobs are the best. Highly recommend. I have a civic SI 8th Gen.
B007NNH0FK|5|Accurate description and fast delivery
B000NJ4DO2|5|Great sun screen. received on time.
B0074JE53S|5|Works great
B001P22OY2|5|Is what it says it is. A hitch extension. Looks strong. Has holes drilled in the right spots. Not much else to say.
B00I8IOQTC|5|Does the job quite well, and at a nice price!
B006P88TJ0|5|Love it
B00TKO0J6C|3|came missing the bulbs
B000BYGCYI|5|great product easy to install
B00FXWLD88|5|Easy to install and use, great product
B0002JMU2U|5|Another great Amazon purchase. Works great.
B008CIWAPU|5|Installed easy
B000N9OCGG|2|About a dozen bristles fell out of the brush the first time I washed my car with it.  I used normal car wash soap and cold water. I am very concerned about the number of bristles that fell out. This should not happen to a brush this expensive. I did not expect this to happen on the first use. I can't recommend purchasing this brush.
B001NYTEP4|5|Used this ramp for the first time today, loading my xr250. Worked excellent, was able to push it up into my pickup truck with ease. This is attributed to the arched design  and the &#34;smoother&#34; ramp surface. This ramp is superior to the atv style or cheaper ramps that have rungs spaced far apart. The safety strap is a nice feature also, I'm sure it help when you are un loading. Build quality is great,  the ramp is lightweight yet strong/rigid. Would recommend to anyone
B00651CLCS|5|Easy to install and looks alot better than the stock antenna.
B008BVZOCE|5|saved my vacation .worked perfectly  excellent price, shipping timing came perfectly. hadn't seen my brother for two years. Thank you Mike.
B001NZSFHG|5|Worked perfect in my Dodge truck! Recommended.
B000HAB7B4|5|These are great! I ordered 4 for my 2000 Dakota Quad Cab. I put em on, and I have not taken them off.
B001OBCI5O|5|Great quality. I bought these after purchasing another brand that came from the store out of round. These were perfect and worked as expected. Build quality is sound and not cheap like some other brands.  I love Raybestos brake parts. Thank you
B00DWKZ8BG|5|Awesome
B00KTIYXLU|1|Not recommended.  These keyless entry remotes both paired fine with my vehicle. Unfortunately they hold no charge and stopped working within 24 hours of taking them out of the package.  Seller is unresponsive. Bump on to the next seller, please.
B0061FY004|5|I like the tool - it is a big help in drilling a straight hole.
B00PHPWX2Q|5|My tractor (bx25d)was not listed so I took a chance on this cover and it fit like a glove.
B00TVUVCI4|3|Just so so
B00QU70X7M|4|Great lights with multi-speed fans.  It cooled off the pop up camper much more and faster than I expected.  Shipping was fast and fans were in good shape when we got them.  Harder to keep attached fully with a little boy who is curious about them, thus the 4 stars, but I suspect it's more the boy than the fans.  ;-)
B00JX5ZVYI|5|Item works out great so our guests don't need to open both trash cans to figure out what is recycling. Looks very nice and doesn't look cheap
B007OWR04Q|5|As advertized
B000EAIFI0|5|difficult to remove original part, but easy to install.
B00LBFA6NY|5|removed old whip antennae and replaced it with the stubby post antennae. No dropoff in performance of radio. Cleaned up look for stylish, Euro appearance. Impressed with item, Buy now
B010PWSDEW|5|Received these today and tested them out with 12v power.  These are pretty bright and gets a little warm.  The color is cool white and the light is a little floody but it is focused enough to give it some direction.<br /><br />The less seem to draw a good amount of power given to them.  The driver definitely does the job of keeping them steady.  They are bright and that is what counts.  I am unsure of the water resistance but it seems like it would be fine if these were installed outside.<br /><br />I recommend these lights for use anywhere.
B0018RBQ16|5|Ordered for a 2002 Ford Explorer V8.  Perfect fit.
B00Q3DNZ2I|5|Works perfect for h11 bulbs perfect fit
B000HTAH70|5|I should have bought one of these YEARS ago. Much easier and more accurate than a center punch & hammer!
B00CTLGSZO|5|Easy set up, have 2004 Ford F250 with towing package and just plug and play.  So far so good.
B007TXXUXA|5|Good quality, I would purchase again if needed.
B0024GIWDK|1|Just horrible, took me 30 seconds to decide to return it.
B008032O8A|5|product is exact match and very clean, however the little rubber vent valve was cut and damaged.... i just removed it and replaced it with my original one after i cleaned it up so it is all good.  THX!!!
B000HRAWEK|2|Item fit well.  Instructions were very basic but easy to follow.  I installed a complete set on my 2007 Yukon SLT and the front set lasted about 3 days.  Both of them flew off on the freeway and were crushed.  The rear set fell off as well about 3 days later.  Contacted the seller and requested a replacement set.  Replacement set was sent, and installed.  Was told I had to return a defective item that was shattered on the freeway... After a few emails sent, I never got a response.  My account was billed AGAIN for the warranty replacement.  Made a phone call to Amazon and the money was refunded after explaining what had happened to the original set.<br /><br />The replacement is starting to fall out of the grooves.  I will have to put WAY better adhesive tape to keep it from flying off my vehicle.  I don't recommend you buy this unless you plan on putting better adhesive tape on the part that slides into the channel.
B000CGF81I|5|excellent product, well made and does the job.<br />quick delivery
B00BTSFOLC|1|Tried the programming for many many hours to no avail. This key will not work for me. I sure wish it would. I really needed a third key. But in spite of following the instructions for programming meticulously for several attempts, it does not work.
B00Q3OM3N4|5|I love it he's awesome worth it
B00HRXQOI0|5|excellent quality
B0009JKI8G|5|works
B000K0080W|5|It took me 10 minutes to replace the speakers of my 2004 Pontiac Grand am. These were the exact replacement (AC Delco). Just plug and play.<br />I saw some reviews about the packaging being bad but each speaker came in separate boxes well packed for me.
B008Y9K7SO|1|I should have read the reviews! My stock motor has 8 splines. This regulator needs a motor that uses 32 splines. I tried to use my spool housing on this new regulator and cable assembly but the cables were too long because this is spool has more windings than my spool. They need to say in the description how many splines this has. They need to require us to match the spline. what a waste of time. I have attached a photo of the new part it has a white circle. I have also attached a photo of the original parts it is all black with larger splines.
B005JU5UEW|5|Excellent replacement blade.  Smooth, clear, stutter-free wiping.
B00PUVBK2G|3|Fits like any seat cover, not real great. Just by the cheap ones they wont fit any worse.
B00IKIIAHY|5|100 % recomendable
B005TCMD18|5|exactly what i wanted
B00RM26LXO|5|Plug and play on my Yamaha FZ09. Gave correct flash rate after replacing stock indicators with LED's
B00REBDW62|5|works a advertised nice quality
B002UC6SNY|3|this should come with the stabilizer bar as it is important to the strength
B002E2D5KY|5|Great product it seem to be better than the OEM but fit perfect and took about 10 minutes to install.
B000WN5F96|5|Arrived on time. Works just like we needed it to.
B000BR8UL8|5|Easy install. Instructions are lacking because they don't tell you how to disassemble the front of your truck to make room to install the grill. Check YouTube to see how the grill comes off if you have a Titan. The grill insert's clips fit very tight and you will have twice as many as you need. Don't fight the upper grille install. Put the clips from the truck radiator support back into the grille and it will just snap back in.<br />Perfect fit on my 2012 Titan even though the Amazon app said it would not fit. A quick call to the company and they were very helpful. Found out that all Titans have the same front bumper. The upper grill is different starting in 2008.
B000XQ2S4M|5|works great
B00B1VBQRS|2|No noticeable difference in performance, mileage and idling didnt smooth out. Used as directed.<br /><br />Move over to Startron<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D3IEIFO?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6<br />Much better product. More uses and better price
B00BJ4EG56|5|Perfect fit and has Mercedes molded right into it.  Way better than auto zone price let alone dealer!  And it really isn't hard to replace.
B00AYI0T1S|3|Nice does the job.
B001AJMOLS|5|Work Great!!!
B003L643KS|5|Gives me 4 access point to my bvintage car's electrical system. I can charge phones, use GPS. Works great!
B009D4RPQ6|5|Nice snug fit that offers a clean look.
B00ENKGRSW|5|Made the job easy.
B000E7DM04|5|Its an Air Filter. it does it job. Nice Snug fit. came in according to measurements. has a nice Sound to it and the engine breathes a lot better.
B0092P1AU8|5|The standard in quality for auto accessories.  High quality fit and finish as always.  I have purchased these for many vehicles over the years, most recently for my 2014 Ford Escape.  Great product!
B008OY8IC6|5|Perfect tires for my Mule 2510, 100% satisfied
B0007N5758|3|The brush is a good size and easy to hold.  The larger side of bristles are soft and clean your fingers pretty good.  They are not much use for under your nails.  The smaller narrow row on the other side is pretty stiff and works well for cleaning under your nails.  That small row of stiff bristles, in the 2 months I have used it, has become useless.  The bristles get bent at different directions and there is nothing left to get under your nail. I don't think I was very rough on it.  Mostly getting dirt out from under my nails from working outside.  I think this is a good brush as long as you look at it as something you have to replace every couple of months.
B00XQVA6GI|5|When I initially got this I was a skeptical.  I wanted some tie downs to attach it to something in my trunk so it would slide around.  I tend to drive like a...  you know.  So having stuff lose in the trunk or elsewhere in the car is a recipe for clean up.  This thing worked really well.  Threw all of my groceries in, drove home like usual and nothing came out, got broken and the organizer was in the same place I put it.  Even better: instead of multiple trips to get everything I was able to just pickup the organizer by its handles and carry it in to the kitchen.<br />I'm very pleased and will be ordering 2 more for the other cars in my family.
B00CW9IS38|5|very good product
B000BRFQLK|5|Fits as expected.
B000UUMM6K|4|Fits nice but we are unable to open the vent all the way.
B002JBDH26|5|Have had to buy this part twice. The first was from another website. Price on this piece was a good one and it seems to be a much better product that the previous purchase.
B007248AXQ|3|product is as described but i am skeptical because it is made with plastic
B00A0BAYR8|1|None of these switches were LED's and have been returned.  I will NOT purchase any other items from this seller.
B00QRVJ7XM|5|I bought this for my husband who autocross races and is always switching out tires. They keep his car clean and helps with carrying the wheels. Very handy and adjusts a little for different sized wheels a little bit.
B00BCRMB34|5|Got these for a work vehicle, the crew was elated to get the nasty seats covered, the other accessories were a plus!
B0064RCKEW|5|This is so cute. Love it, just as described
B00COYNZJ8|5|This is the coolest sunshade ever! Turned my 'vintage' car into the Millenium Falcon! My Trekkie friends are green with envy!
B004GCVS1S|5|Fit perfect . Easy to install . I really love having my mirror again .
B007VDQXNM|5|I like them thnx
B00ONDM07G|5|Was easy to instsll...fit perfectly.
B00ADH6GDU|5|It was a gift for my boyfriend's new car. They are awesome!
B00UME8MPO|5|Finally the correct size
B00SVRHD22|5|Heavy Duty!
B00445U0Q6|5|These things are great! Fit perfectly in my 2005 Ford Expedition
B001KSCQSK|5|Exactly as described
B007NQXCIG|5|A great value for the price! Very happy with the purchase.
B006ZAN0N8|5|I drive a 2012 GS 37. I wanted to find top quality silver touch up paint for my car and this paint worked great. Perfect color match, top notch paint quality, not to mention very fast shipping. I would re-purchase if I ran out of paint.
B004IA8M0S|5|It was exactly what I wanted
B00CP3X1WE|5|Great quality product, a little difficult to put on the first time without instructions, but after that very easy to put on. Great looking and heavy duty.
B00U09WUUY|5|Nice
B004AG8T44|4|No noise, good fit aside from the pad wear sensor
B0036E9VB6|4|The good:<br />It fills air really fast and is extremely easy to use.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The pressure read out is not accurate. Fortunately, I have another digital read-out that I use.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />If you like your tyre pressure to be accurate to decimal point (like me), this product in isolation may disappoint. It helps to buy a digital read out (I use Accutire MS-5510B Gauge, which is awesome).<br />If you are ok in the Tyre pressure being of by about a factor of 1 then you should be ok with this product alone.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? - Yes. But I would most definitely buy the Accutire along with too.
B000CFS0SM|4|The box had been opened up but all the bolts were there.
B00480N18G|5|Great product and shipping. Recommended if you ate looking for this replacement part
B000NU5LP6|5|Guess its working can't really tell.  Put it in because the book said so.
B00JVWDWPS|5|Got it so the dog wouldn't roast in the back and it worked.  It kept her cool even though the sun shined through.
B001FCAXZO|5|Did great !
B000GUX18M|5|havnt installed yet but otherwise a great product for a good price. It comes with a rivet master which is very good to use. I ordered the riveter last week so just waiting on that.<br />my bikes a 00 honda VFR800FI
B002T76YEI|3|Fits as expected and wanted.  Has left hard to remove black spots from rubbing against my white fenders.
B009AA2HDO|1|The product after two months installed is damaged. Bad product. The product was installed by a specialist mechanic. Reclassified seller
B00F5N9A7Q|1|Doesn't  sound like a turbo
B001O7PNNM|3|It didn't really remove the scratches , however it's not as obvious as before.
