B006YTDUKI|5|This frame is easy to install, looks nice on my car and still shine at this point after rain and snow for six months.
B008A3VP6M|5|Have used in a few different applications for RPM sensors.  They work well in that application as long as you use reflective tape.  Cheap yet effective.

B003E3OG4Q|5|I bought this for my Honda it looks great.
B0022ZP7W2|3|The product as it arrived was not the same as the picture in the description. There were only two pieces and the two pieces that arrived did not match either of the style shown in the description. The parts for my boots well and seem sturdy.

B001LHVOVK|3|I received today and tryied it on three cars. Chrysler Voyager 2002, Chrysler Town&Country 2007 and a Jeep Liberty 2005. It worked great, very simple to use, very accurate and relatively fast considering that at the begining it has to check wich protocol is using your vehicle. It's worth to mention that (I supposed that)as I tested this scanner on cars made at the end by the same manufacturer, protocol detection was faster in the second and third car.<br /><br />In any case it worked great. Previously, I used a \\"pro\\" scanner (valued in more that 200 bucks) from a friend and new that the Voyager and the Town&Country didn't have any problems but the Liberty had the \\"check engine\\" indicator on due to the code P0130 (a failure in a oxygen sensor). Well, the point is that I got the same information for the three vehicles, and after fixing the problem with the Oxygen sensor got it clear.<br /><br />The only problem I found is that I cannot retrieve the VIN complete from the Town&Country and the Liberty. It just showed half of the VIN in each car, this is the first 8-9 digits of such code. The 2002 Voyager does not support this feature.<br /><br />In my case I give 4 stars because this problem reteiving VINs, that in my case is not a big problem if the other features work well and accurate. Maybe the problem with the VIN is just for Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep vehicles but honestly I'm not so sure about that and I'm just guessing.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />07/25/2011<br />Updated information:<br /><br />I've been using this device for many months and I downgraded the initial 4 stars to just 3 stars. The reason of doing this is that this Scanner is not very good to detect failures in the ABS system. My 2005 Jeep Liberty's ABS indicator is activated  and this scanner is not detecting any problem. As in my original review, I used my friend' scanner and it detected the problem. As result, one sensor was the problem.
B000VTWQUW|1|I ordered this box rails because they were a good price and the didn't look like these: [...]<br /><br />However, when I received the box rails, they did in fact look like the ones in the above link.  I don't like the looks of them and that's why I didn't buy them.  Check the item number before you buy to see what you're going to get.
B00AO6ENH6|5|the fit is good, not as loud as i though it would be. Yes, i can ware my glasses with this helmet, that was the reason i picked this helmet...
B009M118OA|5|Item was as shown. It was delivered in a timely fashion.The charger works very well, even though the adapter to fit the cart had to be changed to work with the older cart.  Price is very competitive.

B000M8IE6W|4|I purchased this to remove the head gasket and the crankcase gasket on my 1975 Honda CB 550 F SS. I've read some reviews where it is like a miraculous eater of gaskets that if left on long enough it will turn gaskets into liquid and you can remove them just with the wipe of a towel. While that \\"might be true\\" for some people, it definitely wasn't the case fore me.<br /><br />I did a few tests with it to see what the optimum time would be to let the gaskets \\"soak\\". I shook it up like a paint can (rattle can) to make sure it would have a smooth and even spray and saturated the gaskets with an even amount of the white foam.<br /><br />*First I let them soak for about an hour. Didn't have the \\"wipe off\\" effect. (They were softer however). I cleaned them off.<br /><br />*Soaked for 6 Hours. Still didn't have the \\"wipe off\\" effect. (About the same softness as an 1 hr).<br /><br />*Soaked them for 4 days. They  foam dried up, which on the can it recommends that for removing paint, so I was pretty hopeful that the gasket would be very easy to remove. However, they weren't. There was gasket residue I was trying to remove from the head gasket, but even this method didn't nothing to remove them.<br /><br />Even with all of this soaking the gasket residue was still there and as solid as ever, but the crank case gasket was getting softer. I decided to use the SOAK FOR AN HOUR and SCRAPE WITH PLASTIC SCRAPERS method to remove the gasket left on the crank case. Honestly, this worked, it took a lot of time (about 8 hrs to get everything to a perfect mirror smoothness), but honestly worth it.<br /><br />While this isn't a miracle spray to destroy gaskets (might have been because my gaskets are as old as sin or something), but it is a great additive to help remove them quicker. Also a huge added bonus, it kills carbon deposits like a champ which should be advertised. The fact that it is a thick foam lets it cling to the pistons and valves and it eats the carbon right off them MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the carbon cleaner I purchased at a local auto parts store.<br /><br />OVERALL due to the fact that this isn't the miracle gasket remover and I don't see anyway it would work in the 10 - 15 minutes advertised on the can, but it did redeem itself as an additive and carbon slayer I'm giving it a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />ALSO, I'm going to post pictures of the gasket residue, gaskets, and carbon deposits (before and after) to help anyone else out in buying this product, because there's almost zero info anywhere about this stuff.

B005ZKSCLY|5|remote works great..bought it because my brother lost his fobs and I needed to program a new one. the instructions that came with the remote worked great also
B002YS2H5W|5|This T6 LED interior bulb fit ALMOST perfectly in my 1994 Acura Integra Dome Light, it was just a hair wider - so I pulled the dome prongs apart just slightly and this bulb fits nice and snug. The light is a pure white and very bright - it outshines the two front dome lights several times over.  In fact, I am purchasing two more to replace my front dome lights.

B00BFE4OPC|5|My son-in-law's 2006 Nissan Titan A/C blower stopped working completely. When you would turn the switch to any blower speed nothing would happen. You could hear the compressor turn on but the fan would not blow. When I installed this Heater Resistor this solved the problem. The blower works at every speed setting. Also his a/c would stop blowing cold air after the truck was driven for a while. Maybe 5 min. or so then the air would start blowing cold again, like you had a low pressure switch problem. All of his system pressures where good. This part solved that problem also. His a/c unit is working fine now. The reviews on this part where a big reason I purchased this part and boy I'm glad I did.

B001QUY6C6|4|I just installed this radiator in my toyota camry 1999 ce 4 cylinder automatic. I am in no way handy with cars but was able to do this installation by myself. The only thing i suggest is that you get some pliers with a pretty large opening mouth to be able to get around the clamps on the radiator hoses. Also since the camry is so low to the ground you must jack up the car to get under and take the metal protection panel off to drain the radiator. I had some trouble detaching the electric fans as well since my radiator was 12 years old and the plugs were kind of stuck together from being so old. After i had got everything put back together i took it for a spin. I had filled up my radiator but i failed to fill up my reservoir tank. My thermostat went off the charts and i was concerned until i figured out thats what the problem was. I filled the backup tank up and started it back up again and its been running cool ever since.  Also when changing the radiator before you do anything you MUST disconnect the neg. battery terminal first! If you have an alarm system on your car make sure you have the right code so you can reprogram it when you plug your battery back up. Also this radiator comes with NO extra parts you must use all the screws you old one was assembled with. One thing i also made huge mistake on was i almost threw my radiator away with the thermometer still screwed into it. YOU MUST UNSCREW IT FROM YOUR OLD ONE AND SCREW IT BACK INTO THIS ONE!
B00E50E20U|5|nice replacement antenna however be sure to give the correct make and year of your vehicle had to replace the factory antenna.
B004H78NQ0|5|Nice product, easy to assemble.
B001O0HLB6|4|All parts showed up in damaged . Kit requires professional  body shop work to align fenders and hood . No major mods to rad support and inner fenders needed . Looks great.
B008R5AD2K|5|great product....
B000ILE20U|5|This is high quality soldering iron tip for a high quality soldering iron (WES51). If you have a WES51, get Weller tips.
B005HNZOE2|5|You can store a lot more than you would think in these.  Its kind of a tight fit and you might need extra two sided tape, I did, to keep it from detaching but other than that I highly recommend these for your bags

B00DNXGID4|5|Great
B0091OKPS8|5|This jacket is really nice, with tons of pockets. The zip out liner has it's own pockets so with or without you still have inner pockets which is nice. Venting on the arms and back. My only complaint is that although the fit is fine for chest and waist the arms are a tad long. Manageable enough to not lose a star in my book. I'm a 36d, with a 32 waist and ordered a large. It's a bit bulky in the shoulders as well, but that is to be expected with the protective padding in the arms, shoulders and back. Hope that helps!
B003172278|4|I bought this to replace a less than accurate stock model for my Tomos Moped.<br />The unit is an easy assembly with everything you need to attach.  It is important to look up the make and model of your vehicle, as the sensors and cables will be vehicle specific.  The only issue I had was the handlebar mounting bracket which is a plastic single mounting arm.  The bracket is sturdy but doesn't stabalize the unit entirely.  Overall the computer is an excellent aftermarket component for power sport vehicles and the Trail Tech support from their website is outstanding.
B005COIJP2|1|Wires are fragile.<br /><br />Does not come with everything required for installation.<br /><br />Waste of time and money.<br /><br />Should have read all the reviews.
B001GH5P3S|3|It seems like a reasonably good quality piece. No problems installing as long as you follow the directions and do not lose the screws or clips. Watch the tube video if you are worried. My reason for the less than stellar rating is that it needs a update so it holds today's phones.
B004ZF39T0|4|Best HID lights that I've purchased thus far. I took 1 star off for installation...did not fit with ease like other store bought lights for my particular vehicle model (Lexus Gs 300). It took about an hour just to fit lights into housing. Hooking up the wire connectors were simple.
B001O03O8K|4|I ordered this after my local store didn't have any in stock for a 2007 lexus gs350.  worked fine.  All of the pieces pictured were there along with a small amount of high temperature grease.
B00563C76G|5|Little hard getting the old knob off,  Plan on spending a little time on that - Look at YouTube for instructions, But this item is much Much MUCH better than the factory know.  Love the grip of the rubber around the knob.  Wish I had purchased it a couple of years ago, and not waited till the factory knob broke.

B005HEULQC|5|Received faster than expected. Have had it installed for about a week. And it's running great on my '04 WRX.  Can't beat the price.
B00GAH2S0W|5|i will warn you, it only came with one (i knew that) so i bought two. if you're wanting one in the front and one in the back like i did, you'll have to buy two. it is very cute and thick. not flimsy at all. love it!
B00KTIYXLU|5|Works great and very easy to program.  Sure beats $50 for the ones from the Ford dealer.  Would definitely buy again.
B00BUIID8M|5|The item got here before I expected it. It fit perfectly and is very quiet exceeded my expectations thank you
B00GJYW87E|5|I had 5 things I wanted in a new helemt. In no particular order of importance they were:<br />1. Optical clarity<br />2. High Visibility<br />3. Full face, or modular<br />4. Internal sun visor<br />5. Snell Approved or something higher than just DOT<br /><br />The Nolan N44 had all but one of my criteria (no Snell approval) but the other factors outweighed it so I bought it.<br /><br />In Michigan, we're not required to wear a helmet, but I choose to anyway. I've been noticing the Hi-Viz helemts and decided they help the cagers see us when playing on their cell phones or whatever they're doing when they're not paying attention to the road.<br /><br />I've never heard of Nolan before, my previous helmets being Bell and HJC and a few other cheaper brands.<br />In size 2xl I find it a touch tighter than my HJC, which is fine, it still fits and will probably loosen up once I wear it more.<br /><br />The Nolan N44 is quieter than my previous HJC and Bell, this could also mean it will be warmer once summer comes since there is not near as much wind blowing through it, however, noise is not a big thing for me as I wear earplugs when I ride anyway.<br /><br />One of the things I've noticed about ALL my previous helmets was that I could not read my guages, and I'm near sighted. All the face shields were just a curved piece of plastic. The Nolan N44 is not, the face shield is optically correct.. and it shows. I have never had the this kind of visibility in a helmet. Even my peripherial viewing is complete. While wearing this helmet, I cannot see the helmet. That's something I never want to give up now that I have it.<br /><br />The color is definetly brighter than what is shown here, not quite neon but definetly a lot brighter than shown here. I most surely saw cagers notice it.. and while riding, that could save a crash.<br /><br />The internal sun visor works great, now I do not have to bring two pair of glasses with me when I ride.<br /><br />It does not use D-rings to secure the helmet. more of a ratchet system. I made a big mistake in locking the helmet on my head before I knew how to unlock it.. fortunately it was common sense. I didn't like it at first, but am starting to like it. It does not loosen up on it's own and now that I'm used to it, I really do like it.<br /><br />There are several configs to this helmet, I will only be using it as shown in the picture. The added anti-fog screen that you can snap in seems nice, but I have not had a chance to try it yet. I'll edit to this review once I use it and see if it works or not.<br /><br />Nice helmet, the best I've owned so far..cure the helmet. more of a ratchet system.

B003CSQS30|5|The big problem with this kit is you have to run a hot wire all the way to the car battery, apparantly there is not enough available current coming off the rear lights to do the job.  Be prepared for the messy job of stringing a wire through the frame to the front, or get your mechanic to do it.
B0002LBKF6|5|We use it on our boat and it leaves a strong finish that lasts.  We use the acrylic finish to complete the job.  We wouldn't think about using anything else.

B00PCI3MXW|5|Husband loved this for christmas
B001IX4DGA|5|I was, admittedly, skeptical about a purported 2.7% improvement in horsepower.  I mean, seriously, would 314 hp be that much more noticeable than 306?  Absolutely!  It is. I also notice that the vehicle seems to accelerate with greater ease and requires less \\"pedal\\" to get where I want to be.  I'm still gauging fuel efficiency but it does seem to be markedly improved.  My vehicle was already getting 18.5 \ 27.5, vs. the estimated 17 \ 24 - so I was already doing pretty darn good as it was, relatively speaking.  That being said, I'm curious to see how much better, if any, the fuel efficiency is.  I'll definitely report back after about a month of use.<br /><br />As for whether or not I'd buy again, or recommend to a friend.  Yes, I would, wholeheartedly.<br /><br />UPDATE (June 3, 2013):<br />Fuel efficiency is definitely much better.  If I don't drive with ''gusto,'' I get about 2 mpg better than before (20.x mpg vs. 18.5 in the city).  If I do drive with a tad more emphasis on getting there, I drop down to about 18.5 - what I was getting before my modification...so not too shabby.  I still haven't had the chance to travel any great distance on the highway so I can only surmise that fuel efficiency is at least about 2 mpg better, perhaps a tad more.  If\When I do go for a 2+ hour drive, mostly or all highway, I'll try to remember to update my review.<br /><br />UPDATE (June 12, 2013):<br />Today marks my second \\"extended\\" trip in the last 5 days.  Last Thursday, and then again today, I had to drive from Chattanooga to Smyrna, GA - somewhat hilly, but nothing too extreme.  The round-trip is approximately 186 miles.  Last Thursday, I drove the distance at a roughly steady 75 mph and garnered an approximate 25.2 mph average.  Today, I drove the distance at approximately 65 mph and obtained a 29.0 mph average (28.9 down and 29.1 back home).  Both times, the AC was running for the full duration and tire pressure was the same (35 psi) for each trip.  Obviously, the 10 mph difference in speed made a huge difference in mpg.  I'd be tempted to see how much better, if any, 55 mph would do but I'm afraid I'd be run down by the other motorists.  As it was, maintaining a 65 mph average was almost like running the gauntlet.  :-)difference in speed made a huge difference in mpg.

B0068FZY8O|3|When the package arrived it appeared to have been opened and then stapled closed. A part was missing. It was only a nylon washer, but I had to take a trip to the local box store and try and find a match.
B001AHV6GY|5|Looks like a durable product, plenty bright.  I had two of these installed in the tailgate of my Subaru OB - one in each corner. Had them wired to the cargo area light switch. Now when I open the tailgate they go on & nicely illumintate a 5' wide by 4' deep area behind the car. Very nice on dark nights, for camping, or when backing up in dark with tailgate up. Should be standard equiptment on any hatchback type car IMHO.
B00BYH6C1E|5|They paid for themselves almost immediately as they saved a very valuable curly fry from a certain forgotten tomb between my seat and the adjustment rail.<br /><br />They form a very snug fit between the car seat and the center console, but blend in to be unobtrusive. This is a must for any road warriors - shippers, long-haul truckers, travelling sales people, regional drivers, long commuters - or parents of sloppy kids.<br /><br />I'd recommend cleaning your car thoroughly before installing these, though. A good vacuuming session would be wise.
B001C6Q8CK|5|Fit fine for my 1998 Jeep Wrangler TJ. I did modify it, but not out of necessity. I dremeled excess material out the interior cavity to make it into a supposedly more efficient, smoother-flowing &#34;high flow&#34; therm housing, similar to some other brands out there that sell for $50 or more. Simple and easy. Why pay more?
B004QEF9WA|1|Wrong size.  They need to put what size jack pipe it fits.  Inside measurement.
B00RE6KV48|5|I tried this conditioner on my ‘06 Lexus. There is a small part of the leather driver’s seat that is very wrinkled and starting to crack. I poured this conditioner directly on the damaged area and let it absorb for a couple hours.<br /><br />Before - the area was crusted and rough to the touch and I was afraid the leather would tear if my jeans scraped across with enough pressure.<br /><br />After - the cracked area felt much softer and more forgiving as my hands and clothing rubbed against it. The scratches and lighter cracks also became less noticeable in appearance.<br /><br />I was really impressed. I shortly after used it to detail the rest of the car seats with excellent results!
B002GUNCUW|5|excellent fit
B004809YBE|5|Awesome, heavy duty cord for the trailer. I will never be without power again!
B000CJX00Q|5|Installed this on a 2000 Ford F53 Chasis (Class A Motorhome). Appears to be an exact replica of the original.
B00C5SSDUO|5|They fit well, and the safety cord is a good idea. I lost 3 caps in the past. No more paper wasps in my stinky slinky holder.
B001TQ6DI2|4|I added two of these to my motorcycle. These LED's are very bright and significantly light up the road. It also makes the bike (or whatever vehicle you might add these to) far more visible.   Electrical capacity on a lot of motorcycles is limited so it is very helpful that these LED's have a relatively low current draw compared to a high light output. Solid aluminum housing.  Very robustly built and vibration proof. Nice connectors. You can connect multiple pods together if you so desire. I removed one star because I feel that they are too expensive.
B000FW4LT4|5|Very simple and very good. I have tried it - works very well and does not get chipped like plastic ones.
B002PQOA8K|5|FIT and WORK WELL

B0002NYE5W|4|I have never used a detailing clay before, so I have nothing to compare this product to.<br />I will say that this product worked as advertized. Using a lubrication spray, It removed the junk that was stuck in my paint.
B003RF8VEC|5|great product
B000NWBAQ8|2|The harness did not fit properly. The one socket was incorrect, and the wiring was too short. I had to modify the item to make it work.

B005C74XM2|5|Just what I wanted
B0016IMSB4|5|Our heater was stuck on after our 2005 Yukon XL was turned off. After some research, I discovered the old resistor was replaced by this Module kit. Works awesome and was $85 cheaper than the dealership wanted to charge me.
B0022ZOJGM|5|perfect match for my 1985 Honda rebel. couldn't be happier to have a working signal for far less than what the local shops wanted for this and it wasn't in stock anywhere else.
B006Z98JFS|5|Bought my first two in 2013, using them on my Honda GX620-670 LPG fueled generator packaged in a Winco PSS8BW4.  Fit perfect, performed well and have never had any issues.  Just ordered 3 more.
B005GL8D70|4|Fits, but not sure how to secure it.  No instructions.
B002UVKYMQ|1|I buy products off of amazon at least once a week, and have been doing so for the past 3 years.  This company is a joke, and a waste of you time.  I ordered a driver side window motor, and they said they would ship it about a week after i ordered it, and it never shipped.  The company just kept telling me it would ship soon, and never even offered to make it right by upgrading to first class shipping after almost two weeks of it being ordered so i could have it on time.  Don't waste your time, in three years of shopping, this is the worst company i have ever ordered from.  If you order from them, your a fool and you'll never get your product.
B001TJ70ZE|5|I am a very strong Husky Mat person, but thought i would try these out, and will stick to this brand from now on.  they not only fit better than the Husky Mats but are a much better value.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT

B0016LE80K|5|I love this device.  I got one for my other car and then bought a second one a few months later.,  I like the fact it has a cap to keep things from accidentally getting inside and may cause a short. And yes great to have a fuse if you do get that surge.
B007XZK2NA|1|this was the worst item I've ever ordered from Amazon the tape to hold it on was crap.
B000UU3JT4|4|Nice cover for the price.  At first it was a little complicated to get on properly because there are so many straps, but after trailering it with the cover on, we were glad for all the straps - it's very secure.  It's also nice that there is an attached bag to stuff it in once you remove it.  We also like the zipper access to the gas tank. Very happy with the purchase!
B0036R6IT6|4|I put this storage box on a 2012 Polaris Sportsman 400 H.O., and inorder to do so, I had to remvove my rear rack from my bike, which was a little time consuming. It fit well and I had no trouble mounting it with the included U Bolts etc....My only complaint is the rear latches, they seem kind of flimsy and it takes two hands to open the lid and hold the latches so the lid will actually open.  Other than that, I really like this storage box. I do wish the arm rests would open though........
B001INK8EG|5|at first i didn't enjoy how fast it was this thing allowed bubble in and i did my very best to avoid it. after finally getting it perfect i decided to live with the bubbles i had. after a few days they just disappeared. i'm happy again. now for HL2 ep3
B001N0ZTIO|4|I got this license plate frame because my plate somehow kept getting bent.  This is a sturdy, shiny chrome plate that adds a nice touch to the bumper. I am disappointed, however, that I was not able to get the logo snap caps to adhere to the screws.
B0012X0HIE|5|Got 2 for what I would have spent on 1 in local parts store. Watching an instal video on YouTube helped.
B004HOGBDU|5|ALL OK<br /><br /> CONGRATULATIONS
B004QMHNSA|4|The quality of the stitching isn't stellar, but compared to the price of other harness pads its great. I have 3&#34; harnesses and this was the only &#60;$30 set of pads I could find. Foam padding is very nice and cushioned, and no more chaffed neck! I would imagine this product would be too big for a 2&#34; harness, it fits my 3&#34; perfectly. The material is a soft canvas, durable but comfortable, and the bright logo looks sharp (covers up my faded harness).
B004X5WCX6|5|Everyone knows me by my pom mom sticker!!
B007WD3VCC|5|my jijster runs like a bat outta hell great great product i recommend it, you will feel the difference once u install them
B00K2QQGKK|5|great
B00H8DIOOG|4|Me gusto mucho como hay mas iluminacion dentro del vehiculo
B001GRWCXY|5|Contrary to some of the reviews I've read here they don't flap in the wind.  Install was literally 2 mins, and they look and function better than I thought they would.. Only down side is the price.. But true as always you tend to get what you pay for...
B0065712HM|5|Does exactly what intended and is very easy to set up.
B001KSEJBW|5|Well made with a great price
B000HBGHRW|1|I am a bit more than the &#34;weekend warrior&#34; in the garage with the cars, and I thought from the reviews that these gloves were going to be solid.  Wrong.  I don't think they are very durable at all, and they do rip while putting them on (even though the ends are rolled).  I also don't think they hold up very well with grease and oils, and for the money, I will stick to the Kimberly Clark Nitrile ones instead.  Maybe because I use Permatex products with Anti-seize and threadlocker I thought the gloves were going to be durable....
B00BSO3JK0|5|The key fob did the trick.  It took me all of 30 seconds to replace the components from the old key  into the new fob.  Everything worked well at once.  I felt Victorious.  To celebrate, I spent a half hour looking in the mirror and admiring myself and my mechanical prowess.
B0054YJ26K|5|useful
B000NJ14CG|3|Being made out of aluminum these will strip out over time. So they should offer a heavier duty version, since these are a little bit of a pain to replace.
B003DQ0V1G|4|However it does not fit the Toyota tacoma pickup. It is a half inch to big so I had to do some modifications to the device.
B00062YNTQ|5|I purchased this filter on a recommendation from a small business owner that uses air cooled VW Things in his business. Obviously I don't need to talk about K&N quality, they are good, hands down! I've had a K&N filter on every vehicle I've owned and will continue to use them.  My biggest draw to this particular filter was that it will fit straight onto a 34 pict carb found stock on the classic air cooled VW engines! It's a much better option than the little round chrome aftermarket filters out there.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!  And now you know!  And knowing, is half the battle!!!
B009NOZ5BI|5|looks great
B008BRJ5FA|5|Perfect replacement for my burnt out fog light. Much cheaper and more rewarding to DIY.
B000BN3A4Y|5|very well-made hammer... size is just small enough to keep in the center armrest storage for emergencies.
B0002MABGE|4|I don't have any major complaints despite the title. It's just easier if you have a second person to help as there are too many parts sliding around at first. Once it's in place it does its job well, and keeps a boisterous young Doberman out of the passenger seats! Recommended.
B000C2UDX0|5|Works MK1 VW Cabby. This is for EFI, non-vented! The same size (exactly the same) will cross fit ALL Cj7s, Cj5s, and a ton of other vehicals, go look at rockauto web site.<br />Came super quickly to my place on teh Oregon coast.<br />lastly screw you orelly/autozone for not carrying any METAL locking caps!
B004QJOP8O|5|perfect replacement, and only a couple bucks more than just buying the filter.
B001227AHG|5|Worked perfectly. Ordered the TEKTON 4929 3/8-Inch Drive by 7/8-Inch Oxygen Sensor Socket with the sensor, and had it installed in less than 15 minutes.
B00BD4BWQI|1|This tool is garbage.  It's milled out of soft aluminum stock and a very poor fit. Will slip and cause damage to you or the nut you're attempting to remove or tighten.  Save your money and buy a proper tool made of hardened steel.
B0000CBIK5|5|Excellent product.  This meets all my expectations and we loved it.  I would recommend this product.  I would recommend it.
B00P83U5Z4|5|Mounted and worked as a factory part
B00E5OUOCQ|3|A little small for my car, but it will work.
B003ZJQ56Q|5|BETTER THAN OEM
B00L3KJG8S|5|this fit my 08 ford edge I took it to the dealer and had it programed after waiting over a hour to have it programmed I got home and went to lock my door with it and it did not work. I was disappointed I contacted Discount keyless and the customer service was the nicest and we went online like we were told and programmed it to unlock and lock doors ourselves easy 2min fix. Thanks Discount Keys
B005JJ2UAK|4|Works as good or better than the OEM pads on my Concours 14.  Makes a little more noise than stock, but that's to be expected with such a hard pad.
B003XUH4QM|5|Very nice quality exactly what you would expect with ARP products.
B00042KGMG|3|Kinda disappointed here, I replaced a Larin from TSC w this one. As others have stated the paint is kinda cheesy. Mine actually looks used and repainted. If this was goin on more then an '88 burban I'd probably return it. The little pad eye on top looks weak as well as the base. Overall it'll do the job. I won't buy another off of here, I'll go somewhere I can look at it and put my hands on it. Aesthetically disappointed, structurally looks ok.
B0031I2SO4|4|Seriously. It's a rotor. If you install it right, you should never have to care how it works. It does its job.
B000SL4AA2|5|Not real fast, but it works. I use it on a slow leaking tire (bad seal at the rims) about once a week and it works. Great pump for the price
B004EIAADG|5|Bought this since I wanted one that could more than just jump my battery. Use it quite often to top off tires on two cars, use the jump about once a week for people at work - many different cars. The air compressor is a little loud, but I've found that all of these types of machines are. Rarely use the inverter, but after a year of using this thing, everything is still running fine and no problems so far.
B0013JVZ7O|4|Here in the Colorado Rockies, sub freezing weather often lowers tire pressure and causes the low inflation warning light to illuminate. With this tire gauge its a snap to check pressure in all the tires and deal only with the one(s) that need inflating. All in the comfort of my garage. No cold finger or dirty knees.
B004KL0I9I|4|I bought one of these from another vendor, couldn't get it to connect to my Android phone, and returned it.<br /><br />A few months later I bought this one.  The packaging is essentially the same, I believe it's the same product.  I still couldn't get it to connect.  This time, though, instead of assuming I'd gotten a bad unit twice, I dug in a little more.  I found a text file on the accompanying CD that gave me the pairing code, and that's all I needed.  I use the Torque app on Android, and everything comes over just great.<br /><br />Verdict:  Great product, could use slightly better documentation, but if you pay attention, you'll get what you're looking for.
B000E7X1MI|3|hood hinges not as heavy material that I thought they would be for being hinges
B002OKAFS6|5|Great tire. Don't buy this from MC Power sports. They sent me the wrong tire and then told me to get the right one it would cost $29.00 more. I just got my money back and ordered from another vendor.
B00G49DUJY|5|I love this detailer. I used it to clean the whole interior of my car except for seats and windows. It makes the dash shine with oily feel. and it even cleans the instrument cluster lens and touch screen radio with no streaks. Another BIG plus is that it makes the car smell nice and clean.
B000K044L6|5|My Avalanche started losing sound several months ago. It would not come on until after several minutes, and got worse. I did an intetnet search and learned that the ampliier for a Bose system is separate. I found this one, ordered it, took it to audio shop to install ($79 cost) and now it works and sounds great. Much cheaper than the over $700 that the GM dealer would have charged.
B0042QMYFC|5|People say they're matrix like .. I just like them
B00VR812CO|5|Very nice buy
B00FAZ912S|5|The spoiler arrived- It's been installed- looks awesome! The light bar had some kind of shortage, but I contacted<br />Spoiler and Wing King directly and they will be sending me a replacement out this week. I am very satified with my purchase.<br />Would recommend!
B0048G17JA|1|Did not fit my 2014 RAV4
B009YR00MI|4|Nice unit that travels well for camping. This is one of the largest capacity storage that I've foiund in the market and it seems reasonalbly priced. I have to. Charge one which I use the other. I take it camping and plug an electric blanket in the tent to keep me toasty but it only last about 4 hours before it it drained. So start the blanket late in the evening or in the morning you will freeze.
B00HH5CVXK|5|Thank you this good
B00HQEKGB6|5|We haven't had this installed in our travel trailer very long, but so far we love this product..  First of all, it swishes the water etc. down more like a regular toilet. There is a greater flushing action.  Secondly, it sits higher and &#34;fits&#34; better than the toilets that are standard. Next, my husband installed it quickly, and without any difficulty at all.  Lastly, it seems to keep cleaner without as much effort.  There are less tiny spaces for residue to get trapped in.  All in all, I would spend the extra money if you are replacing your toilet in your travel trailer and buy this product.  (I just have to get used to using a foot flush as we had a hand flush previously)
B00BZAGXRS|3|I'm still debating on this battery, it seems to have a short, but I am checking my bike to make sure it's the battery.  I never had a problem with a short on the bike before but now I do.  Fits in my 01 Bombardier ds 650 fine.
B001KS86XO|5|The mirror was prefect and fit right. The size was just what was said. The price was good. They shipped it right away.
B005HTLTFY|4|Shipment was fast.  Installation was easy and everything fit.  I purchased the system to improve the weak sound of the stock 2013 V6 Challenger.  Flowmaster did improve the sound.  I just wanted a bit more base growl.  As a Harley owner of a V-Twin I am use to what sounds can be made and I guess I am spoiled.  Flowmaster is a good system though and I like it a lot better than the stock system.
B000FQ0BC6|1|Poor quality,clutch pivot ball pressed in on wrong side.would not come out without damaging part. Will get another one from someone else.  Don't buy
B007GEETWS|4|seems tobe good quality at a great price, shipping was fast, and part was identical to on I took off at over double the price
B00651CB50|5|Works well!! No problem with it at all. Does bend a little bit when on the freeway. But not a big deal for me
B004HNT4WQ|5|Very easy to use, the locking mechanism works smoothly and reliably. The keys are standard quality, nothing wrong here either. Buy it you will no be disappointed.
B000GVAFYY|5|My husband loves them.
B002XL2IG8|5|Well made, just what I needed at a great price, would recommend and will buy camco products again' , ,
B00F4ISFC8|4|had a little trouble installing it but looks great
B00EAOIHMK|5|Perfect fit for Kia Optima 2012; easy install
B000SOKE5E|3|Works great!
B0019335X6|5|Don't buy another version of this for the LSX based motors. This is the tool you want hands down.  Perfect everytime.
B002J7VX4Y|4|Keeping with other reviewer's suggestions, I wanted to be sure I didn't over-spray my car. To test the product out, I put one spray on a paper towel and left the paper towel in the car overnight. That was just the right amount of scent, with the bonus that I could remove it if I didn't like how it smelled. The smell is fine, provided you don't overdo it. This bottle of scent will last longer than your car.
B003V9UU66|5|This is the second jar of cement I've purchased. The first was a different brand and the consistency of it was thicker than the slime brand. The slime brand flows on easy and is great for fixing flats on inner tubes etc. I will purchase this product again
B002FE3VLE|5|Everything lined up and fit good purchase.
B009B5S2CS|5|Ordered two and when I received them one was a Ford original, Ford box said Made in the USA, Motorcraft box did not state country of origin but looks identical to the USA part.
B004T39YX8|5|Perfect for southwest plane. Comes with a velvet pouch, I carried it in my purse, pulled it out and buckled it as soon as I got to my seat, no problem.
B007Q9QVSI|5|Worked great to fix my abs and traction control lights..
B004QHICTY|2|It was advertised to fit a 2008 Chevy Uplander...absolutely doesn't. It is not made for this vehicle. besides that the quality is questionable.
B00B022T8S|5|I love this belt.  It fits me perfectly.  I weigh about 235 pounds but that is mostly because of my hips and stomach.  Looks awesome and fits great.  I wear it almost everyday (whenever I wear jeans or pants).  I've had this belt for a couple weeks now and I never get sick of it.  It's very comfortable and doesn't bite into my skin.  I would recommend this belt for my friends, family, and anybody who likes to wear belts that look awesome.
B000AP8EQ2|5|Purchased for my 01 Lincoln Town Car.  Had no problems installing and fit very snuggily. Excellent purchase for the price.
B000JTKSQ8|2|Product labeling does not match image. The AMZ online product image matches my 4 year old pad but what I received looks like it was done at the copy store. The pad color is the correct yellow but the labeling on the back side of the pad looks cheap.  The pad and hub are not as nice quality as my old pad. For this price I expected better quality.
B00DZ3M85Y|5|i love the bright white light it creates.
B0055TP0M4|5|Used for 2014 Ford Escape.  Easy to apply with directions provided.  Works great.  I used 550 cord to measure the length of the door edge.  Then I used the length of the 550 cord to cut the edge gaurd.
B00B2Y1IJ0|5|Great. It arrived in good time and it was exactly what I wanted. Thanks.
B00EJA3E1Y|5|Good product, fast shipping, easy install. I recommend this company.
B000SKV4T8|5|The life of an engine depends on Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycles to prevent friction which causes heat.  You can get along without it but you will get along by foot.
B00A2EATZ0|3|the atv look the same as what i orderd. but it came in a shipping crate completly disasembled whis was no problem,i can image someone without tools would do.anyway after i put it together it would not crank with the starter button.so i went to the auto parts store an purchase a starter button an it work fine but the remote will not kill the engine. therefore i give ita rateing of three
B00CC2ZL44|5|I Emailed OPT 7 through Amazon before the purchase and was very please with their attitude and helpfulness.  The product arrived very timely and well packed.<br />The weather has been very cold so have not installed it yet.<br />I will do a final review about the installation and how well they work after installation.
B00Q1F74IE|5|On time, exactly what  was described
B00GEV98GG|5|This is a very cool looking half mask! The quality is quite good, it keeps my face warm, looks awesome and fits great! I have an average to large head and it fits great (just so you know a simple measurement) it also came quite fast so I'm very happy with this purchase.
B004CPYI9S|4|The helmet fits and works as it should. It could be MUCH better, but for the price its quite the value. The inside of the helmet isn't as well padded as my vega 3/4, but thats probably good because it is a little bit more snug than my vega.<br />The paint on the outside isn't perfect, but i think thats the fault of the manufacturer for sub-standard packaging.<br />The visor is crystal clear though and doesn't fog up easily. Its opens and closes flawlessly and that makes it much easier to get on. Doesn't hold open quite so well when you're walking around, but it will hold open.<br />I bought this helmet for the cold crisp mornings before the sun comes up which it works absolutely great for, but in the afternoon when it's warm and I'm commuting home the vents sure don't offer much airflow.
B0002Z9R4S|5|I bought this to replace the passenger wiper on a 2005 Acura RL. I also replaced the driver side with the 28&#34; blade. It took some effort to take out the old one and put in a new one, but it was definitely well worth it! They wipe amazingly well, and the water definitely beads up as advertized on the package.<br /><br />Some reviews complain of the wiper not fitting correctly and/or the blade warps/breaks. The metal frame is fragile, so I would recommend pulling the blade through instead of trying to push them through the track (what I am saying will make sense once you do the install). The Acura blade frame lets the wipers self adjust as they wipe. If you bend the frame, they can't adjust.<br /><br />Oh! Also, at the very end of the replacement blade, there is a little groove at the end to lock it into place. Obviously, don't push it past there or you'll lose/break the blade.
B000AM8BJU|5|Love this on my car.  A quick shine and little effort.
B0062PMTS8|5|Its a sticker, what is there to review.<br />IT STICKS ! YAY !!!<br />Not sure how easy it is to get it out after a while, but not planning to
B000E43A1S|5|excellent product, I recommend...
B00068XCQU|5|Husband loved it so much he purchased a second one...batteries will no longer go low; husband hooked one for the lawn motor tractor and one for his motorcycle!!!
B0029HOULW|5|This is a very good replacement part. The name brand cups cost a lot more and dont give any more.
B00E5OUOCQ|2|Did not fit toyota highlander 2013. Works well for toyota tacoma 2004.
B0058OPV1Q|5|I received them over two weeks ago, where have you been - you're late. Never again will I order with you.  Gy/Sgt. Lew Souder
B00FH2U3LW|3|Cover does well.  Straps deteriorate quickly, stretch and do not hold well.
B00S09869U|5|Fit perfectly. Love it.
B00CPYC9BC|5|Mets expectations!
B000YIW5VA|4|The scanner works as advertised.  The only glitch I had was that the connector did not come off the car's connector easily. The manufacture does not warn you about is that the connector's has a latch mechanism which prevents it from slipping off.  Unless you are made aware of this trying to remove the connector is next to impossible.  In my case I needed to use a flat headed screw driver to release the latch. In the website picture it shows up as a small white square on the inside of the connector.    The other thing to note is that engine codes are only partially standardized.  THe unit can read the code but you may not be  able to look up its definition in the provided booklet if the code is manufacture proprietary hence the need for the web site.  If the code is an open standard the unit will also indicate the severity of the problem: i.e. \\"must fix immediately\\" or \\"you can wait a day or two\\" etc.
B003X8457K|5|Love it!
B00BN07ZM2|4|Bought for a 92 Honda Prelude. Was skeptical of being held on only by tape, but seems to stick pretty well. Doesn't sit flush on the outside edges, though. The tape does, but the outer lip doesn't follow the contour of the roof, leaving a small gap. While waiting for it to arrive I pulled the stock visor off, and it's a bit quieter without any visor at all than with this one on, and certainly louder than the stock visor. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning.
B00OZ1FQAO|5|Great exhaust for the money. Easy to install and sounds awesome!  Here is a link to the video I made of the bike before and after installing the exhaust http://youtu.be/VrDJs6mBQu4
B00O1AH6UW|5|The shirt got here on time & fits well (kinda stretchy) . Wasnt the material i was expecting but still good overall 👍no complaints .
B007RUJZJI|4|This set looks well made, and actually is made in the USA.  I have researched that the GM 3.1 Liter V-6 (mines a '92) can have an intake manifold gasket failure prior to 100,000 miles.  I have 93,000 and had some anti-freeze detected in my oil.  Improved Felpro sets are available for some, but couldn't find one for my car.  I feel that this set will work well, with proper installation techniques,and torque readings.  I plan to write a follow up after I complete the task.  I installed this set, drove car 1,300 miles.  No oil leaks, coolant or fuel leaks. If you do this job, I recommend the following:  New distributor O-ring, new thermostat and gasket, test injectors (I found a bad one) and use new o-rings, check hoses and vacuum lines; clean your throttle body, all components, and sealing surfaces thoroughly.  Do not over tighten the cork valve cover gaskets.  I used permatex red spray sealant on the cover side, and a thin layer of gray silicone sealant on the block side.
B004LLQNL4|5|Bought this for the arthritis in my spine,  Works great, heats up nice, heats quickly, comfortable,  Would definitely recommend this product.
B0036G0ZYQ|5|Window regulator was just as described and the price was more than right.  The dealer price was $140, this was a little more than 1/3 the cost of a dealer part. It came on time and was the exact fit for our vehicle. Being that I do repairs myself it was perfect in every aspect.  We would return to this site for any future automotive purchases. Mark
B000UUMM6K|5|used to make a repair...good price and it does what it was designed to do.  easy to install
B001O1L166|5|My husband loves this cargo tray! Easy to set in back of his 2013 Honda Fit. Perfect size, very sturdy! Fast shipping! Would recommend to anyone owning a Honda Fit.
B0043063JU|2|I had product about a year, loved it at first. Suppose to be a year round mat... It left mold and dirt everywhere, even if you moved it to clean normally. Not that strong either, blew around all the time, even with something on it, also ripped very easy, like a bamboo material.
B000HBGKH4|5|ok
B000GV0FVW|5|Came on time looks awesome on my 99 warrior worth the price took 5 minutes to put on this bumper is a must get.
B001EAQTRI|4|Works great to reduce egine buzzing.
B00HWHBQX4|3|Works but is not a great situation.  Obviously not OEM quality.
B00029JXM0|5|this is a must if you are installing a water temp on a machine like i was. works great if you use this
B00EK5EYBW|2|I bought a set of these off another sites offering.  I did not install them right away as they were for a project I was planning.<br />I was highly disappointed to find the adjuster pivoting screw had backed out of both of my lights.  I managed to fish them back into position and rig one up that had broken out of a splits fastening boss.  I tried mounting them and proceeded to try and adjust what I could.  I then found the inner reflector(s) had separated from the housing(s).  Adjusting them did no good.<br /><br />The results, the drivers side up and to the right, and the passengers side straight and very low.<br />Other quality issues:<br />The turn signal receptacle is incompatible with standard bulbs unless you force the bulb past the  improperly indexed keyway.<br />The access panel tab broke on the passenger side.<br />The H4 retention springs had to be reformed.<br />The reflector design is terrible and makes a almost square pattern and even if adjustable, would be a challenge to aim.<br />The smoke tint, looks great in the daytime, but kills any benefit of H4 bulbs<br />The lenses get very hot due to the black tint.<br /><br />I don't recommend these lights,  If you see an image of a grey/blue jetta in one of the advertising pictures and &#34;Crystal Smoke Clear Head Lights Lamps Signal+Fog Dy Vw Jetta Bora Mk4 Mk4&#34;, those lights are not worth the money.<br />Performance is subpar at best and quality was 100% defective for the two I bought as a pair.<br /><br />Now I am shopping for another set, and wished I had bought something more OEM.
B0031ZDU62|5|My vehicle is a 2003 Ford Expedition with the 5.4L V8 that had 118K on the odometer. I started experiencing lack of power and buckling under load while on the hwy at about 70 mph and while in overdrive. I'm a 30 year veteran master mechanic. Needless to say I was somewhat skeptical about this set but read all the reviews and decided to give them a shot. The coil packs appeared to be identical to the OEM ones I was replacing. After install along with new NGK (3403) TR55GP G-Power spark plugs the engine had at least a 25% increase in power. It was like night and day and I was just blown away! I have now put about 1500 miles on these coil packs and they are fabulous and have been working perfectly. Buy these and new spark plugs and you wont believe the horsepower increase!
B00DCTLOVA|5|typical explorer wheel well rust, a little bondex and this trim made a big difference.
B005FKS4J4|1|Purchased the brake kit for my Toyota Truck. Rotors came warped out of the box, requiring machining.  It has been 3 months since I installed the kit now and about 5k miles.  Pads ARE DUSTY, silver rims look black after a week.  The rotors are already warped again, severely.  At highway speeds, when depressing brake, the whole truck shakes and the steering wheel shimmies so much it causes the keys to rattle.  Stay away from these, unless you like to do brake jobs every three months......
B00407TVDQ|5|Perfect match.
B000H7JJY4|5|Just what we needed and at a much better price than anything local!
B000CODEXY|1|If I could give it less stars, I will. It'sa wrong match on the cars. When you contact Amazon, they take a long time to take any action. Pretty useless.
B003COTFS4|5|I have had this for a while now. It is everything they said it was and more. It has paid for its self on more than a dozen times.
B00068XCQU|5|I wouldn't trust anything else on my bike.  This will extend the life of a battery by years.
B000Q6HKHO|5|Very happy with the ease of the lift and release!
B0069ARUKI|5|good
B00JGC7TCK|1|They were not very bright
B0037NQGOQ|5|Used this shield (dark smoke) on my black Shoei Qwest Helmet.  Fit perfectly and it looks awesome.  Love the totally incognito element of the dark smoke shield!
B000W20LKK|5|Just as described great seller
B001EOV45G|5|Went on easily and looks nice at the right price.
B007OW62V8|5|Very good product which very much met my expectations.
B0002M9QJM|5|This along with HELLA HLA-H83140171 H4 12V 100/80W Halogen made a huge improvement in lighting for night time riding.
B000F2JOKU|5|I saw this intake at the SEMA show in Philly this year, and new I had to have it.   <br /> <br />It comes in three finishes, and is very well built, fitment takes a little pushing, and the instructions are a little vague about where you need to cut your wheel wells.  Install wise it is a 2 out of 5, moderate install, requires the removal of the front bumper, battery and washer resevour. <br /> <br />If you are doing the install on a car with an anti-theft radio, please make sure you have your security code, as the battery does have to come out, and will trip your anti theft.
B00B9FFE9M|4|Great grill and very unique. Gloss black is not a stock option for the Astro van. When I put this one on, it made my van look like the Chevy version of Boba Fett's helmet. :) Seriously though, it fit great and I had no trouble with it.
B0013CXCYK|4|I only wish I had ordered this sooner. After I got my car painted, some jerk scraped my back bumper not four days after painting it. No new scratches since this baby is in use. Deters scratches from back, but will not deter scratches on the sides, which happen a lot when idiots are parallel parking. Why they didn't design this to cover the entire bumper is a bit of a mystery.
B000HZRTDE|5|I am well pleased with this glove box document organizer! The owners manual for my Chevy Equinox fit into the pocket snugly so I will not have to worry about it falling out. There are several other pockets to store my registration and insurance information also the small notepad and pen holder is a nice touch. I like the zippered pocket on the front of the organizer which I plan to use for receipt storage. The organizer also fit perfectly into my vehicle's glove box and does not take up a lot of space. Some reviewers have complained about the quality of this product but in my option the quality of the product is more than I expected for the price.
B004AGEX8K|5|Fit my 2004 Honda Odyssey perfectly.  High-quality Bosch product.  Installed with the same Brake Pads.  Together, these products work flawlessly and are squeak-free!  Easy DIY to save hundreds of dollars!  My dealer quoted me $617 for front and rear pads and rotors (for some low quality brand too).  I bought all Bosch, front and back, pads and rotors, for $240!  Had them all installed in 3 hours!
B000EPSXBE|4|Easy to install
B000EQCHBU|5|Got these for a Nissan Pathfinder with 160k.  Great dampening ratios. Valving offers comfort while maintaining control.  Good quality construction.  I really like the ride and handling these offer. I was worried that they'd be too stiff/harsh.  Not the case at all, they are perfect.
B002IAQVW6|4|nice bendable wire.
B0007XQ3CE|5|Excellent product.
B003QJF12O|5|nice alarm very easy to install and really works.<br />people look at my when I go &#34;beep&#34; on the motorcycle.
B000KQK6XU|5|I received the product in zip-lock bags but that wasn't even a big deal. Inside, the daisy magnets were adorable and cute. The colors are very vibrant and can easily be seen. The edges are very crisp and looks well made. I've had the pink and lime green one on my car since March and none have fallen off, even when my car has been more than REALLY dirty. I recommend this product if you want to add cute decorations to the exterior of your car.
B001GRSS4Q|4|They don't fit quite as well as I expected. There's a small gap around front edges, but it's not really anything to worry about. Aside from that, they work great. Not sure they are really worth the extra cost when compared to cheaper options, but if you can afford it, I would recommend them!
B001DBTVH8|5|Bolt holes in cover and gasket lined up perfectly.  Bolts were correct size and thread pitch (surprising). Only issue is that the drain plug was missing.  Pick one up from auto parts store, 1/2&#34; DIA M20 thread pitch.
B00DJ7OVG0|2|Looked good and looked like it could handle the job of removing a flywheel. However after mounting it to the flywheel with the supplied bolts and ramping up the tension on the center bolt the metal started to bend and eventually the center &#34;nut&#34; failed and pulled off the &#34;disk&#34;. I separated the disk and nut and discovered that this was cast steel and not plate steel and as such it wasn't anywhere near as strong as I needed to remove the flywheel on my Evinrude outboard. Ultimately I remounted it sans the center &#34;nut&#34; and even though I had a third of the threads remaining I was able to pop my flywheel loose of the crank. I wish this tool was the proper construction but if you need it to pull seriously stubborn flywheels this isn't a good choice.<br /><br />On the good side none of the threads stripped.
B005D4AHSS|5|I received the kit within 24 hours of ordering. It was packaged good and easy to install. I ordered the 5000k kit which is pure white with no blue. Hopefully these last long.Love it so far. I installed it in my 2012  Nissan Altima.
B004WIWN1U|5|These things are great, and well priced.  Used them for my half shafts and drive shaft on my A4 quattro.  Perfect size, glad i didn't get the longer ones.
B00ELVZYW8|5|I put the snoopy on the back window of my white honda pilot.  It's the perfect size and looks so cute
B001FC9D6E|5|Great Smelling, Fast Acting, Easy to use... Give this one a try I think you will be happy with your results
B0009LPJ0Q|5|This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found.<br />It does exactly what I was looking for it to do.
B00DTLR4PQ|5|These were my cheapest option when my 1999 Chevy Tracker's original lug nuts started to become stripped. They fit on very nicely; a little longer/protruding than other lug nuts, but not really an issue. Actually, this kind of gives the wheels a sportier look! The extra-shiny polished finish is a plus as well. I'd definitely reorder these if I ever needed them again in the future. :-)
B00466V9AY|5|very easy to program and works great, just like factory .
B003Z9UUUS|4|Exactly as advertised. Has held up well on our 2012 Dodge Ram 2500 Short bed pickup. We even saw an increase in our mpg. Have been through several storms and nothing has gotten wet.
B008L4S8NI|4|Worth the money
B0035CIFW0|5|We had another brand of lightbar that shorted out after just a month. Not nearly as much fun to have 1/2 a bar across your truck's backend! The Putco 90009=60 LED tailgate light functions much better, albiet at a higher (and well worth it) price. It is super easy to install, just plug and go. The light is very clear and bright and looks GREAT!<br />AND, it has a lifetime guarantee!! It doesn't get much better than this!
B009AA2FAY|5|Figured that my &#34;Service Air Bag&#34; light was on due to a faulty sensor. Had a garage check it and it was the Front Impact Sensor on the right side (apparently this side is the most common one to fail). The garage charged my $30.00 for the diagnosis and the sensor was $58.99. It took about 30-40 minutes to change. I disconnected the battery negative cable and waited 30 minutes as recommended. The sensor is an awkward spot and I had to pull a lower radiator cover but it came out easily enough. The new one went in easily. Reconnected the battery and started the truck. Light is off and the truck is safe to drive again. Total cost with sensor, shipping and diagnosis was about $95.00. Replacing it at the garage would have been $225.00 and more than that at the Chevrolet dealer. Very satisfied!<br /><br />P.S.  Used Dorman's YouTube video as a reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxeGV_yo1RM
B007NMGQL0|5|this diff cover is awesome,it looks great on the  rear end of the car,plus it has cooling fins wich the oem diff cover does not and it has a higher capacity for better cooling,perrin delivers again and again this product is superior in construction than similar products and keeps my differential nice and cool and performing well
B0050SF6F6|1|though these headers looked great I was very disappointed that they did not line up to the heads and would have leaked terriblly. put them back in the box and returned to sender. never trust anything not maded in america. (another thing I did not know until I saw it stamped into the metal)  Would have thought that a california company would make locally  but nope they went south.
B00DYVXR16|1|Not what i expected
B0012TYNY2|5|I have a couple of these and they are the best for keeping your bike's battery charged.  Would buy again especially at this price break!
B005JVFH4O|5|I have nothing bad to say about this tail light, looks just like the pictures. Received in a timely fashion from Astra Depot in San Leandro, California. Has nice smoked look to it, but when you turn it on it is nice and bright. Can really tell the difference between tail light and stop light.<br /><br />Black wire = Ground<br />Red wire = Tail light<br />Green wire = Brake light<br /><br />The three white LEDs (license plate lights) stay illuminated with either the red or green wire hooked up.<br />I did not receive a cross necklace with mine like the previous reviewer. Your results may vary.<br />Using for a different application, a mini bike--so I can't comment on fitment. It is smaller than I had envisioned (even though the dimensions are given), but it will work just fine.
B008VQ690U|5|Great!!!!
B0055AMSWI|5|Starter had been running slow, making car hard to start, finally wouldn't. Well made and with through cleaning starts like new.
B00F7NEREU|5|Love it
B00HDMEU68|5|Needed a car seat cover for after the gym to avoid serious car stench and this fits the bill. Easy to use and wash - what more can you need?
B001VXXUWK|5|Very customizable. Pretty comfortable for wearing for a few hours
B004ETGQKG|5|Can't be beat for the value...convenient storage bag and very easy to attach.
B0009I5WS8|4|This kit worked well, but the instructions did not properly indicate the location to find the factory wiring harness.  This harness on my 2003 Subaru Outback was under the right side utility storage box accessible from the rear cargo compartment.
B004UQQMYI|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B000CJ1ZOO|5|So far so good! Wishing I would have ordered these before. Like the looks a lot more than the plastic formed ones I bought before .At least these won't break from the cold. Also shipping time was great!!
B000CPCD9Y|5|Great replacement bushings - used to replace steering stabilizer bushings that had dried and cracked in desert heat.
B000C7HJIW|5|I thought I could get one more day out of my truck before replacing the oil pump. Ends up I shared the teeth off the bottom pulley with the timing chain. Didn't need an oil pump anymore so I sent it back. These are quality oil pumps and far less than buying them at Napa
B00CASDZKC|5|Fit well. I like how they fasten with clips so my daughter can't just pull them off the seat with her feet. The material wipes clean and is actually thicker than I thought it would be.
B000NCOKQK|4|be careful when ordering a battery tender.  This model is for gel-type batteries although the description does not state such.    I re-ordered the correct type and could not be happier with the product.
B000GASX9O|5|Great price and product
B000BNZPSI|3|One the plus side, the lock hardware itself feels pretty sturdy, more heavy duty than the mailbox lock I was expecting to see. The installation of the lock was very easy, but there are a few issues with the product that may be specific to my vehicle (2003 Chevy Silverado SS), but I suspect not. First off, the screw to attach the lock is too short, such that I could only get one or two threads into the lock. I will remedy this by buying a longer bolt, but I shouldn't have to. Second, the plastic bezel does not sit flush with the tailgate and feels like it's about to pop out. In addition, the lock cut-out on the bezel does not line up quite right with the lock. It's minor, but noticeable. Still trying to determine how to fix these issues. Lastly, it feels like if someone really wanted to break in, they would just pull the handle until something broke. I pulled it pretty hard, but not as hard as I could, and something was definitely about to break. I wish there was a better product on the market; I would gladly pay double the cost of this unit for one that worked well.
B00BQE5JAK|4|These leds serve their purpose and do it well. I installed 4 of these as interior lighting since my dome lights weren't enough. The leds themselves put out a decent amount of light but, I wouldn't install them on the outside of a car any time soon. The adhesive strips on the back are not trustworthy at all and I supplemented them with a few small dabs of glue to get them to stop falling off. Since I applied the glue they have all stuck for over 2 weeks with no issues. Without the glue they all fell from their locations within a night, hence the 4 star review.<br /><br />A lot of people have been asking for the power draw of the strips and noone seemed to have to accurate of an answer. Since I was installing into a setup with other devices I was worried my amp draw would be too great so I hard wired a small amp meter. These pull a grand total of .37amps (4 light strips) or about .09 amps a piece. Basically you could leave these running over night and I doubt it'd put a dent in your car battery.<br />The wire that is attached the led bar is very thin, low strand, and a pain in the butt to strip so be mindful of that when wiring up.
B000CB0K5W|1|Like other reviewers noted, using the 'this fits my car' feature of Amazon is spotty at best.  This was the wrong size for a 2009 Subaru WRX, and apparently most other Subarus--which need a 5PK882 or 5PK890.
B000VAS8K8|5|this product is much better than the Husky brand.  i had originally bought the Husky to save a few bucks, however the fit was poor and quality was lacking.  the Weathertech is the only way to go.
B006GT3556|1|I received the pump very fast only to install it into to tank ,replace the tank and all hoses just to find out the (NEW) pump wasn't pumping.It's a lot of work to replace the in tank pump and have it not work.I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this pump or one similar break down spend the money it beats doing the job three times.I just hope my refund is as fast as the delivery.
B004OJZDAK|5|Swap out was a snap.  Fit perfectly on my United trailer and was much needed.  Last one rusted and the seals broke so it was extremely difficult to turn.  This one works perfect and hoping it lasts me a long time.
B002FDMPNK|3|Description didn't say product was exclusive to motorcycles' plates, but I should have read it more carefully because while it does mention 'bike' it did not specifically exclude use on automobiles.<br />I drive a smaller Scion which makes it from Toyota - was hoping to add more reflectivity to my backside to increase my small car's visibility with early winter evenings coming on.  Anyway, if we assume that most USA-sold autos use the same basic size bolt and female 'receiver', the bolt ends on these slip in and out of the female part meaning that if I was to take this car out on the street the plate and reflectors and everything would fall off onto the street.<br />Well I'll hold onto these since they were so inexpensive but hopefully this helps another car driver looking for a similar product,  I should have done more research.<br />As for the items themselves, made in USA, the bolts, housings, wing nuts, and springs all seemed of decent quality and had I a motorcycle I would have been comfortable using them on my bike.  HTH
B002Z5VIS6|5|Finally found tire covers that will protect my trailer tires from the elements. I live in the High Desert of Southern California--wide range of temperatures. These covers are easy to take off and put on, too.
B00DSD7KBS|5|Works out on car really well. Has not come off and is perfect for any GIR fans!
B0031HTYA6|5|Part was exactly as expected and a perfect fit.
B00EECM5FI|5|works great, just the color i wanted.  will be ordering similar for the other car
B001341K92|3|The license plate is ok cute. I was hoping for it to be a brighter bling. Probably will end up purchasing something else.
B000QUXYXE|5|Other reviewers say they don't fit ,so they don't work and they didn't use them or they drilled new holes<br /><br />I can see how one would think that , the female cup brackets that go on the gate aren't presicely shaped they don't hug the shape of the tail gate exactly , but it doesn't matter just get all the bolts started first and tighten them down the things bend them selfs rite into shape as you tighten them . Nothing to it.<br /><br />Side by side comparison to the original GM parts these replacements are better , solid welds, solid hinge posts, plated.<br /><br />Use your head and get them in there
B001LHW9YG|5|i bought this and i own 3 vehicles it conected to my 2000 chevrolet s-10 and cleared my codes and it also hooked up to my girlfriends 2002 kia spectra and saved us alot of time and money and helped me figure out which coil pack was bad but the only thing that sucked is i need a different conector for it to connect to my 1997 chevrolet blazer but it worked great and is very easy to use would recommend this to anyone save yourself time and money with this so easy to use my girlfriend could use it
B000QIUY5W|5|Factory just what I needed.
B000NJAAA8|5|Cleans as described. I used as cleaning prep before applying roof repair tape on travel trailer.
B000BZAAJ0|5|Excellent product as expected.  Made in USA, very fast shipping. Easy to install.  Now we just need to see how long it lasts.  Would definately recommend, a little extra cost, but you can see the quality.
B003BZQRV2|1|My boat weights 3,500 pounds and these 5,000 pound rated wheel dolly bent as I tried to move my boat across the concrete floor
B006H81YRM|1|Price was fine, with shipping almost too much but I was in a pinch.<br /><br />Shipping, it took over twice as long as stated for delivery<br /><br />Item cheap and broken, if you want mirrors that fold in so you can't see anything with a super cheap design get these  If not keep looking.
B00E1IVMHM|5|Used to cover minor damage to my rear bumper. Perfect Fit.
B00HV8T3WA|5|Thin metal, but they seem to hold quite well. They've been on the bike all summer and there's no problems
B00390VH96|5|Looks great in the Jeep!! Better than expected, and good quality.
B000E0E6TW|5|great product
B00B4T26PS|3|Works, not overly impress , not quiet what I was expecting .
B00F93ASZA|5|Nicely done, enhances the look on my car.
B000VL6AHU|5|Fit my 2013 Scion xB perfect. Took 5 minutes to change...
B00CGFPW64|4|look really nice
B003BV47KE|3|It is a good buy, does have all it says in the package.<br />I have not done my T-belt, drive belts or water pump yet so<br />I will see soon .
B000C9GLIO|5|OEM parts that fit perfectly. More cost effective than purchasing from a local dealer.
B00BR5Q3AI|5|I was sceptical about paying $90 for this light but wow what an investment! The light is not only highly visable at night but during the day too! And woth all the different flash patterns you will have no problem to find what suits your needs. Its light weigjt and very easy to assemble!
B00177WH8S|5|I cleaned the window with windex, removed the red lining from the 3M tape, and placed it on the car and done! Looks great! This is worth the money.
B00C178JZI|5|It was a good replacement for my old pwk carb
B003ENZ8OI|4|Received just a picture.<br />Thank you
B000VB3NR0|5|Same as floor mats- truly great product that exceeds the posted description.  Highly recommend - thank you!
B000H6P55W|5|Held a lot more than I expected and freed up much needed interior space. Very sturdy and easy to attache. Stood up to rainstorms and high winds on 18 hour trip to Florida. No water leakage and straps are very strong.
B0002SRCMO|3|it kinda works for intended purpose. Still had a hard time removing the fasteners. Better than a screwdriver
B005G9Y20O|5|Works great. Took a 4 hr drive from Chicago up to Michigan over the weekend. Kept the sun off us(it was 90) but still had that windy open feel. Helps a lot when there's a quick rain storm out of nowhere. Keeps my wife's seat dry so enough said.
B004NFXA7I|4|I haven't had a chance to try them out yet but based on everything I have seen on the internet, am sure it will perform as advertised.
B0041TTSRC|4|It was the correct part for replacement.  Unfortunately, it did not come with a new wire harness (short one), which my Jeep also needed replacement (thankfully, it only costs $28 .... but the delay was a half day wasted).<br /><br />I guess my mechanic presumed my Amazon starter came with the wires and didn't mention it needed a wire harness (because their local supplier includes it).  It would behoove Amazon (and their suppliers) to make suggestions of what is usually needed with replacing a starter (like with other Amazon products page that have a paragraph suggesting &#34;usually bought together with&#34;).
B00CPL8OVE|5|highly recommend this product,it cleans pumps and injectors. if you have problems with missing / lack of power  this product is great
B001VMS0CG|5|The part number is correct for what it is. Its a front wheel speed sensor not a fuel level sender. I knew that when ordering it so I had no problem but someone will be disapointed if they were expecting a fuel level sender. Ive told Amazon about the incorrect listing but apparently they arent going to change it.
B0002MA8TE|4|We recently adopted a large dog from the local shelter. We make monthly trips to visit friends and family about 300 miles away. The addition of the new dog put space at a premium and we decided to purchase the Kar Pak Waterproof car top carrier. We are pleased with our purchase. It has withstood rain, sleet and now snow. It has also handled trips across the Mackinac Bridge with ease. Glad we got our Kar Pak. It definitely makes traveling with \\"all\\" of our stuff easier.
B00K2SLS7O|5|Worked out great for extra storage
B001FCE5AI|5|thanks
B00EVY344K|4|Great product! Definitely worth my money. Not a fan of the plastic casing that it comes with though. It's a little bit hard to stuff the chamois back in because of the friction caused by it. My other chamois had no problem with that.
B009LX636C|1|I got the wrong color temp than what I requested, a step down. When I went to put them in they did not lock and wiggled around. When I turned them on one was dimmer than the other, I check and its not my ballasts. When I emailed the seller about these issues I never got a response, no email, no sorry, no &#34;how can we fix this.&#34;, just nothing. I'm not happy with the product or the seller. I hope others that try them will have better luck.
B001CF1A7O|5|Not much to say about this one, just a piece of steel with a couple holes in it.  Works great, fits into hitch just fine, quality product.
B004AGC5FS|5|&#34;Affordable&#34; brake rotors are always a big question mark.  &#34;Should I spend $100 per side on something that may be had around forty bucks but with no-name buyer confidence, and a gamble on squeaking or lop-sided manufacture?&#34;  With these Bosch QuietCast Premium rotors, you needn't fret.  My sets were made in Italy.  NOT CHINA.  The noticeable coating and/or special mixed metallurgy allows you to install the rotor against a set of new, high quality pads, and not have to &#34;turn&#34; the rotor before installation.  This not only saves time, but it'll save MONEY since you'll get essentially an extra set of pad's worth of use before you neeed to change rotors again!
B00BJNV1T6|1|Was the correct part but it was defective bc it was missing pieces. Possibly not really the original manufacturer part and an actual knock off.
B0022YCE9M|5|I have the shortshoots V&H exausts so aesthetically they look perfect together!!<br />Easy to mount! It took about 1h30 form me, but i'm no expert!<br />Gorgeous looking air filter! Very powerfull looking!
B003RVHPY8|5|Great deal. Fits perfectly
B00A75O6VW|3|the mirrors are not heavy feel almost like your holding plastic not a good quality product but they do shine and have a good chrome look just not real sure how they are going to hold up decent for price but just expected a better mirror
B000CSWCAG|5|worked perfectly, strong smell but ultimately effective
B00IW5LPLI|5|As described. Great item, nice Chrome and solid metal
B0081S5IP0|5|great product, reasonable price and delivered as promised
B00T9AGKQ0|5|[[VIDEOID:6829af69bc62a80a87c497bdeadd68e6]] I've reviews a lot of batteries in the past, and a lot of \\"batteries that do other things\\", but never one that could jumpstart my car!<br />I haven't had the opportunity to test this thing out actually starting my car yet, thankfully, but it's nice to know it's an option, if I'm stuck on the side of the road somewhere.<br /><br />The device feels very solid, comes with a ton of included laptop plugs, and an amazing carrying case for it all. At its current price, even if it were just a massive battery that could charge a laptop, it would be worth it, but to also be an emergency light and car jump starter? Very hard to say no.
B0068ERF50|5|I was looking for a way that will allow my young daughter to ride with me on a motorcycle known for its power: Yamaha R1. I have a 2001 model, the last carbureted one with linear throttle but I still have to be careful how quick I open it :)<br /><br />On such motorcycles there is not much to hold on other than the driver but when you are small that is a hard thing especially when driver is in motorcycle gear. The other option is to hold on the seat strap but that makes you stay upright when you need to stay glued to the back of the driver on this bike. I also heard of a belt that the driver wears but I do not like that idea as the belt will shift on the body plus the passenger will pull on the driver body instead of motorcycle body.<br /><br />This design has the passenger hands where you want them - on the tank but also gives the passenger a secure grab so it serves for holding on for both acceleration and deceleration.<br /><br />W/o this device I would have postponed taking her on the bike until she was past teen years.<br /><br />The only thing you should be aware is that it does interfere with riding on a track or hard riding in general when you want to be out of the wind and as close to the tank as possible. Basically it makes you ride more upright or better said ride in a more relaxed posture. Given that you have a passenger that may not be a cons after all :)
B009PTS3K6|3|Be ware!!! The purchse of this product is on ONE case, and not THREE like the picture shoes. So for that price you only he tome (1) case.
B004VRO19Y|5|Works great on me trailer wheels.
B00009WC2N|1|This unit is HORRIBLE. I passed up all the negative reviews about this product and figured I would try it out myself. Fairly easy to install, however, the operating range is around 10 feet. I have the antenna straight and out of the way from metal and any possible interference, and yet I have to be in touching distance from the car for the remote to work. In this case, what is the point of having a remote start???????
B002P8EMRW|5|My caps keep getting stolen all the time, and I am tired of replacing them. $2.00 every time for 4 of them. now I have a supply. Thanks for having them available! I have a 5 year old Equinox with nitrogen in the tires and the color difference from regular air, alerts the mechanics.
B002UXDS40|5|Does exactly what it should do. I run the Firstgear pant and jacket liners with glove liners, and dual zones are awesome!
B002EIJMLE|4|I got this for a 2010 Accord Crosstour with the 3.5 V6.  The instructions were alright but were incomplete for my engine layout.  I had a different layout for my PCV valve and a second hose that needed rerouting.  Other than the PCV valve, the kit fit perfectly.  There is no extra hardware with the kit so be careful with the washers.  I still have one somewhere in the engine compartment.  Other than that, the sound is great and when I'm easy on the gas, the mileage is up over the factory box.
B001QV9XW8|5|They worked great.  Just need to have the front end checked and adjusted now.
B008RQGIO6|3|Not what I expected does fit but  falls of every time i sit  but does the job I guess I can do for now...
B001EOWPOA|5|Exactly as it should be. This is a plastic two part plug rather than a molded one, so its not as sturdy as some, but overall its very solidly build, with nice brass contacts. I used it to add battery charge and a backup light to my camper and it works great for that. If you need a 7 pin plug for occasional use this is perfect. If you're looking for something that is going to be used day-in, day-out in a commercial setting, go with something sturdier like a molded plug.
B001TL7GE2|1|I ended up giving this to a co worker who has a small car.  I have a Nissan Murano and it just did not fit.  Not even close.  It's horrible.  I hate it.
B001JT3292|1|I received my first antenna and put it on my dump truck and about 4 hours later it was broken. The mast broke at the spring. I received my second antenna and put it on and it did the same thing but it made it 3 days. Im done with it but luckily it works ok broken. Junk
B004GDPDG8|3|Was hoping for a satin finish but other than that perfect
B00SXGWOL6|1|On star will not activate this because it is in my Jeep Wrangler!
B000BLKV9S|5|Great!
B009XSK5VY|1|Amazon's website says it fits 2000 Toyota Sienna, so I bought it when I bought cabin air filters for my other cars.  Well, when trying to locate my current cabin air filter to replace it, I discovered there isn't one for that model year.  Toyota Siennas don't have cabin air filters until the 2004 model.  Clearly the website and databases need to be updated to reflect this.
B00DNSDJ9A|1|I never received my decal. What a load of crap.
B00AIAA0HA|5|I ordered the silver one by accident (totally my fault) and decided to replace it with black one. Contacted Bupmerguard's cistomer service fully prepared to pay for both shipping back of the silver one and the new shipping of the black one. NEVER HAD TO. They just offered to replace it for free both ways, which basically means they made no money on me. I don't expect companies to loose money on clients when clients skrew up, so such courtesy is unimaginable in my world and I truly appreciate Bumperguard for this approach. Not to mention the product that is really great and just as the doctor prescribed, but this is one company I recommend everyone to deal with, obviously would be highly recommended by me to all my friends and whoever asks.
B000C2WKHW|5|FIRST CLASS PRODUCT
B001RVA4ES|5|I works much better than the usual plastic spreaders. They are easier to clean and spread smoother with a fine edge.
B001RNOHBC|1|i ordered this product as i needed it for the week end. didnt try it first an i should have. it didnt run at all and i took it out of the package so i cant send it back.
B0046KIABG|4|Decent brightness, not super &#34;white&#34; light.  Because of other reviews, I was concerned about how it attached to the roll cage, but it's solid.  I'd actually like a 2nd one now, one for the back of the cage and one for the front
B000CISZOI|2|I bought these when I was restoring the factory ride to a very abused Grand Am. They were awesome for about one half of a year. The rubber on these control arms has broken already and they now look like they did when I replaced them... The quality is substandard but they are still working no real wobble or anything noticeable yet other than my visual inspection showing they are ripped already
B004VUKRNA|5|Fit my 2012 DR650SE just fine.  Has better stopping power than the OEM pads I pulled off.  I'll be sure to get these again...
B000VAZHBQ|4|O2 sensor fit perfectly on my 2000 Nissan Maxima. Quick and easy removal and install with the O2 socket tool.
B0040CTVBS|5|These little things are wonderful!!! I use these things all around my car! They are super versatile and have saved my butt more than once, I would recommend these to anyone and everyone.
B00D31NA1E|4|Good
B000NK9CN8|3|Did not fit perfectly for 2011 Rav4, need to adjust and force.
B00R587N4G|3|The replacement I received came in better condition.
B000HZRTDE|5|I was able to place all my documents and related booklets in it and have it handy in my glove compartment.
B004A6PLSG|5|Most people don't even realize they have cabin air filters in their cars, but changing them can make a big difference in how well your heat and ac works. I tried these, and they really seem to cut out odors from the moisture in the ac system.
B00067BW6S|1|Put these in my Prius V as DRLs/High beams back in August 2014. Seemed like good quality and works as my DRLs and high beams were as good as stock. These bulbs have a yellowish hue more than blue but my big problem is one already burned out. That's pathetic. Stay away and just spend your money on LEDs at this point as prices are starting to come down.
B00FQ0P1U8|5|Good product saves me a lot of money...
B001ABOXGK|5|Overall I'm very impressed: from packing to install to performance: item is packed to perfection, easy to understand instructions: I'm far from a mechanic and with simple tools and being able to read- had it installed correctly in under an hour.  The intake looks amazing in the engine bay. Sounds great.  It's tough to say if I got any HP or torque gains because the car already pushes 400 HP.  In depth articles that have the dyno results before/after show circa 12HP/10 torque: this is very believable because the intake allows for more air. more air is more power. Frankly, it doesn't matter if my HP gain was 0 because it just looks way cool in the engine bay; and the improved sound is worth $325 anyway to me.  Note: the MAF screws are a little tough to screw back in.  for a second you'll wonder if they are the wrong size. but just apply pressure!
B008HISXUG|1|Arrived melted and stuck to the back of another sign
B000EDUTVS|3|Good for dog tie or alt tie down.  Mine has bent though so could be stronger. Hard to get into ground too
B0024NSRSI|5|Excellent replacement for Nissan Frontier lights that are dull. Shine well and looks great. Bought the  fog lights to go with headlights. Looks real good. Now if only I could get Ralph to loosen up the wallet and do the same.
B000CIO1I2|5|Very easy to install, only 2 wires to the coil. Fast starts and predictable spark timing. Beats setting points. Highly recommend and a very good price. Also, does not require an HEI distributor.
B00IUXQM38|5|Very good.
B0085G9RR8|5|Fit perfect on my boyfriends 95 eg coupe and made it look extra fresh.. the color is bright love it.
B001EDBEZM|5|I've used the brand before and am very satisfied with it's quality and they're fast shipping. Another thing nice is the product pours easily and the container is just the right size to handle during measuring.
B00E4W9IEO|5|Worked well
B00AWN2Q5M|5|It was exactly what my husband wanted...he's a tiger nut and they really dressed up the inside of his truck!
B000HDI4HQ|5|Needed one right away, shipped quicked, better than taken a ride to different RV store to find the product.  Nice to shop on line.
B001CI94DS|5|Worked really good on the honda grom after removing the stock bar end weight.
B002XM39M4|1|Save your money and look for something better. Fasting nuts stamped out of such a thin metal that threads were  almost nonexistent, stripped out easily.
B000VU7NL8|5|As Advertised....can't ask much more!
B00EKUFRZO|1|The sticker was torn in half in the package before we opened it at the bottom of the heart we went a head an used it but its not going to last sure would like a replacement one sent then I could five star ya
B001NZQIDE|5|Took less than five minutes to hook up break controller using this cable to my 2004 f-250 Superduty. Good Product.
B007OXCIB0|1|Waste of money barley sticks. And sun took it right off i understand im in vegas so it gets a little hot here but even woth adhesive. Spay it came up the next day
B002MOAWL4|5|Like I said, super thin and super sticky! love it! 3M tape of all kinds is best for emblems of all sizes.
B0009XXN8Y|4|I purchased this belt several weeks ago and just now put it on my Jimmy.<br />It's working fine,but time will tell.<br />I did order a back-up so I'll be covered.<br />\\"GREAT VALUE\\"
B00029J4H4|5|First time ever that I got a plug and play carb that really worked that way.  Hook it up and it worked the first time and didn't have to do anything but adjust the idle just a little bit.  Been running good every since.  This was a change over from a Rochester 2 barrow to this holley 2300 350cfm and it did require an adapter plate and was a real improvement for my 225 cu in dodge slant six.  Added a manual choke kit but so far has started up without it even in cold weather, just a couple of pumps on the throttle and it cranks right over and starts, stays running until warmed up.  I love this setup!
B00I53VV1G|5|Great item
B00792IRF2|5|Item arrived very well packaged, and is the exact same quality as the OEM part.  It also includes a new foam gasket.  Does not include bulbs, but that is ok & to be expected.
B000C5WCN6|5|Awesome , perfect fit and excellent price!!!
B003EORAS4|5|This product fits well on most steering wheels and feels wonderful as you drive.  It also wards off extreem heat and cold.  I am very pleased with it.  Darrell
B0041RZMQA|5|This is a high quality filter for the Toyota 2GRFE engine. It is much better than the standart cardboard end filters, and has a finer filtration.
B008VWFZX6|5|It shipped on time. It was packaged nice. I'm happy with the kit. Comes with every thing you need to put together the front end of a go kart.
B008XLPP9E|5|Very nice. Can't go wrong with 3M products.
B001C5SBYO|4|Very fitness
B002669U3O|5|Product fits as advertised and was very easy to self install on 2007 Nissan Sentra. Under 15 minutes. Was delivered with skull cap - painted black - so no need to order separate cap and paint.
B001LTVHYM|2|Very nice produce good design for my water flow, after it mounted to the block  water line does line up back up with other side
B0049DWQR4|5|Part worked perfectly and came 4 days early, the new spring is stiffer than the old one other than that I am very happy W/ my purchase and the service from Part Kings. Why Chrysler decided to put a plastic part where a metal one should be is a mystery to me, they could'nt have saved that much money,but they sure have caused alot of headaches, Thanks Part Kings
B004A0DREC|5|I installed this bearing in my 2006 Saab 9-3 Convertible.  It seems well made and sure is quieter than the one I replaced.  I bought two, but was a little hesitant to replace something that wasn't &#34;broken&#34; on the other.  The quality of GMB seems decent, but there are hit or miss reviews on them from a quality standpoint.  I'm 5,000 miles in and no problems, so I'll be sure to post if I have any issues down the road.  Otherwise, this is a great product.
B00G258I0G|5|Super sturdy, like adjustability
B006Q7C7L6|4|I bot this because of others reviews. It charged my 4g Epic in Seaman like fashion. I bot this to charge my Ford Edge battery while it's in storage. Since it's not in storage, I gave the review w/my phone instead. One quibble, if you plug the charge indicator in, you can't use the panel for anything else. So I called the co., and asked if I could splice the charge indicator into the panels wires. He wouldn't confirm or denie, BUT did say that it would void my warranty! I still may try it. I'll update if I feel the need to try it. P.S. If you have tinted windows, and put the panel behind them, it WILL cut down the panels output.<br /><br />Update: 5/5/13 - Well, now that I have had time to evaluate it's use on my stored tow car, that I pull behind my motor home, I'll say it is well worth it. We leave the motor home/car in dry storage in Key West for Nov/Dec. I opened the door, turned the key, and the car started right up. I also have 2-155 watt \\"go-power\\" solar cells on the motor home that keep the 4 \\"house\\" batteries, and the 2 engine batteries full up. Quality solar is the way to go for auto/motor home use. It isn't exactly free, but the pay off comes very quickly.
B001NI7KE2|3|The hanging bar came well packed and on time, however it had many scuff marks on it with a used appearance; I suppose this is a seller problem, not item problem.<br /><br />That said...<br />Pros: +anti-slip, +adjustable length<br />Cons: -width expands, but when you go to tighten sometimes you cannot tighten in a way where both pieces of hanging hardware are facing the correct way. So you have to take a risk and leave the pole loose<br /><br />I have now used this hanging bar for two cross country moves and overall, it did the job.
B002TV7WKO|5|ok, gotta give this all the stars.  I seldom do that.  but for durability it wins.  I've stood on this thing about 40 hours now, repeatedly fixing my ford 6.0, usually on the side of the road during out 22,000 km road trip in 2014.  have two 8 inch hid's  mounted on it.  it's an easy install. wish there were tabs to zip strap the wiring to.
B00CKZMDP8|4|I own three of these mats and I put them all in my Man Cave. Great feedback from all who have seen them.
B001F67CY0|5|I normally do not write product reviews, but it's rare that I find anything that impresses me as much as this product. FOAMTEK is very easy to use and it performs exactly as promised! I have a very busy schedule with little time to spend washing AND waxing my SUV, which makes this all-in-one product perfect (especially since it actually works). Spray it on, wipe it off, buff it out. I can wash and wax with one product, quick and effectively - no water needed! It is the only FOAMING waterless wash/wax on the market that I have seen..and certainly much better than the basic waterless products that tend to run. With this product, the foam lifts the dirt off of the surface so that when it is wiped off, it does not scratch the surface. It leaves a layer of wax behind and when that is buffed, the surface is clean, shiny and protected. It is also works on on chrome and tires. I will definitely tell friends and family about this!
B000CIADLG|5|Wanted to give this system a trial before moving to a bigger customized installation.  Apart from the mounting frame being a little frustrating to put together (but not unreasonable for the price) I found this easy to assemble;  the system worked right out of the box - no problems whatsoever.  23.5 +/- 0.1 volts open circuit on each of the 4 panels.  The controller is rather limited, but this a \\"small\\" system - charges batteries perfectly well, as advertised; the angular efficiency of the panels is surprisingly good.  A good choice for someone wanting to get familiar with these components, and will be excellent for an RV rooftop power supply.
B00ASO51B6|5|just what hubby needed!
B005LLR1A0|5|I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this vest. I would recommend this to anyone. It's great to wear at home, at ballgames, at work if your work is cold and you need to cut the chill in the air. Love it
B000ARTZPO|3|I bought this item because of a hard shift. After I poured it it started to slip but later after I believe 50 miles or or more it stop slipping but still have the hard shift. For some it might work but for me it didn´t. Guess I had bad luck.
B00HJ1592C|3|It looks a little cheap to me and hard to fasten on the car.
B0046VYLMC|5|These valve caps are sturdy and look similar to the ones that you get with new tires. There isn't much to say other than they fit well and seem to keep a good seal on the valve stem.
B009DK08UU|5|Delivered within 3 days.  looks like the factory grill.
B001RNOHBC|5|This has worked for me so far. I used it on a 3 hr drive to keep my netbook charged and not once did it get hot and I never heard a fan go on. Very Quiet. One thing is that it did not come with a carrying bag like stated in the listing.... Oh well. Would I recommend it to anyone..... YES I WOULD
B000H2DLMA|5|Great sealed beam upgrade.
B0019COQ6C|5|I bought this gun after being disappointed in 2 of the Craftsman pneumatic grease guns. Both were supposed to be \\"shop\\" quality but they weren't even close to the Lincoln.<br /><br />I've been using this gun daily for about a month and so far it has been great (I'm in the lift truck repair business). Nice heavy duty design that's made in the USA! The continuous variable flow trigger works just as advertised. They say it's rated up to 6000PSI but I have mine regulated at 80 right now (separate regulator required). I've used it at 150PSI a couple times for those plugged fittings and it cleared them right out. I would recommend a regulator just to be on the safe side. I wouldn't hesitate to use it at up to 120 or 130 PSI regularly, I just don't need to.<br /><br />The seal quality inside the tube is the best I've seen. There is no grease seepage past the seal and into the lower chamber. The plunger is clean each time I refill.<br /><br />I really have nothing negative to say about the gun. You might think it's expensive but if you use a grease gun often, it'll pay for itself easily. Better than continually buying inferior guns and trying to save a buck. Believe me, I've been there.<br /><br />One tip on the refills; to avoid losing the prime, I always pack the tube receptacle area (where the tube screws into the gun assembly) with a dollop or two of grease so it's flush with the end of the threads. You may get a bit of overflow as you screw down the tube but you won't get any air pockets. Worth the small mess to me.<br /><br />Now that you've read the review, put it in your cart and be done with buying grease guns!
B003G6V6O4|5|Great bright lights you may need to get a ceramic wire harness as this 100w will melt stock plastic harnesses.
B000GRXU4U|5|great product
B00400M86A|4|Definitely reduces the amount of wind coming up through the bottom of the helmet, thus reducing the wind noise. It's not very clear how to install, however. But with a minute of internet research I looked it up and installed it. Nice addition to my helmet.
B0070Y341G|5|These light up the area around the rear bumper like a flashlight, or like the trunk is open. They're wonderful!
B009GNAZG6|3|They were the right part and fit great  it just didn't fix my problem I had something messed up in my valve body
B007LICJ0S|5|Looks good on my ride.
B004Y3FV6W|5|The product came new in box and was exactly what I ordered!  Great results lowering the car about 1.5 inches in the front and 2.0 inches in the back.
B000MLF7CS|4|After a slight mix up with the delivery, I recieved my U581 as promised.  The unit worked great except for certain GM codes that were not available. The code was there, but the explanation of it was not available.  I thought it might be that I did not make sure to \\"\\"Update\\" the unit (sometimes the item arrives and there are new updates already that need to be installed).  So I read the skimpy manual that came with it, hooked up the antiquated Serial Cable to my computer (they need to include a USB Cable and Software Drivers), went on the website and tried to download the update...it Didn't work.  I have tried the unit on about 6 cars in the past week and the only one that I had trouble with was a 96 Buick. It even worked good when used on a 2001 Volkswagen.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Just what it was represented as.  Fit the alarm system and charged up under normal use.<br /><br />Needed to change terminals as these are .250&#34; size , but that was no problem for me.  Another person should buy the adapters offered. They are around the same price as a box of correct sized terminals and you don't have to remove existing terminals and crimp on the correct size.
B0040D0O2C|5|You all have been told this a million times. . .never buy car parts from a dealership!!!  I was able to purchase facia clips, fender bumper covers and flare moulding clips as a set. . .all required to mount my front fend back on my Jeep Liberty.  They were a 1/3 of the cost that I was quoted at three dealerships, and I recieved 2-day free shipping because I am a Amazon Prime Member.
B001C9ALCA|5|This fit perfect and is as well made if not better than the stock gasket.
B004HAG7K6|4|Great microfiber towels.Just the right size for head wraps.<br />After taking showers I wrap this towel around my head for a quick dry.<br />Microfiber is the best towel for drying. I highly recommened<br />these towels, and for the price are a good buy.<br />[[ASIN:B00IEULIHM 4-pack of Blue Microfiber Hand Towels. Our 16\\"x 24\\" Microfiber Towels Have Endless Amounts of Uses. They're Excellent Drying Towels- Use Them As Microfiber Face Towels.]]
B00407V634|5|I looked for this hard to find paint for my old Camaro for a while before finding it on Amazon.  It was a perfect match.  Thanks Amazon.  Joe Gargiulo, Keizer, Oregon
B000JFJLP6|5|I shoiuld have  purchased this years ago, great product
B000C5WD08|5|Works perfectly
B004C443PI|1|These gloves are made very cheap, look sloppy and the fingers are off.  I will be returning them.  Also, they run large
B000BZI1YG|5|Took no time what-so-ever to put in.<br />1997 Subaru Impreza<br />Works like a charm.
B00I9JC3N6|1|not as much surface as I thought there would be...rather chintzy material!
B00B9F93SK|5|This did not come with my Equinox when I purchased it. I always use the net when grocery shopping or carrying small items.
B0030GDLTI|5|Item came in a little sooner than expected.  Also didnt expect the extension cord to be provided as well.  The starter came with all the required hardware, bolted right up and worked perfectly.  The only thing I might add would be instructions as the hardware is slightly different from OEM, so it took a second to be sure it was being located properly.
B000X23XMC|5|got for mother for mothers day for her new 2015 mazda 6, she LOVES it!
B008IK7TSA|5|perfect fit good quality
B00S67P6X0|5|this has to be the brightest LED light bar I was impressed with it. It arrived on time and was easy to install. I would buy this product again from the supplier.<br />Thanks,<br />JH
B0018ICAMO|5|I drove around for a whole day trying to find these at camper stores, with no luck. I finally just ordered them here, got them quickly, and were a piece of cake to install (look it up on you tube). It is so nice not having to hold the cap door up with my head! Cheap improvement to your cap that will make life a little easier!
B002P8CYOU|5|Fits great!<br />Only thing was that my car had a heated mirror and this part is not. So the wire connector doesn't match at all. I figured out which wires worked the mirror motor wires and spliced them together. No problem for a mechanic 😃
B000066OC7|3|not very firm /flatten rather quickly
B00EZZVI7U|4|This is a decent light.  I put 2 of them over the dinet in my RV.  Only a couple negative that were small.  It is difficult to position the wires for a flat installation.  The screws are to small for the typical RV ceiling.  I used the old ones from my old lights.  I did order 2 more.  The light is white and turned my RV cave into a nice bright living space.
B00DL5BVPO|3|The  two front mud flaps/splash guards fit nicely but the back ones needed to be modified to fit my car. :(  I have a  Fiat 5000 Pop.<br />Solid black instead of the red and black ordered, then supposedly gray and white after a month long delay for delivery, main company was out of stock but I wasn't informed until I contacted the seller/owner, who was responsive.
B009VI5TDU|5|This is a great kit.  It came with the instructions to do the rebuild, and it solved my problem with the engine stalling when it was cold.  You will need to have a can of brake or carburetor cleaner on hand when you do the job.  The inside of the fuel head will have a lot of trash and debris inside of it when you take it apart.
B004U8JH84|5|I think not. Price is best from this Amazon reseller I've found. Triumph dealer now peddles Castrol...  I buy a couple cases a year and go from there. No worries.
B000CKRN44|3|It fit and seemed to work fine.. but I went to change my oil one day and noticed this cap was warped from the heat. I did order another one and so far so good.
B003RXIL4Y|4|The product works perfect
B00JHMKNZO|5|I bought this cleaner as it came recommended from a friend. After using it on my steering wheel on a 2009 M3 Coupe I must say the results are way beyond my expectations. The look and feel of the steering wheel have returned to how the car came out of the dealer, honestly I think even better than new. Even the stitching around the steering wheel looks brand new and bright. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a professional high quality leather cleaner. Seller shipped the business next day and sent communication after shipping. Came well packed as well.
B003WDEYPE|4|The package was shipped and arrived promptly. The connector works with my trickle chargers and allows me to avoid using extension cords for my trickle chargers. This keeps the charger's large transformer plug in off the floor and on the wall.
B0010AN0SI|5|Perfect!
B000FW62UA|5|as expected
B0066CP998|4|I did a direct install and the heater really put out some heat in my little truck.
B00932FBUU|5|This light is BRIGHT and just works, even in daylight.  Great light for the money. Simple to use. Several flashing patterns to choose from,  I would buy it again.
B003VAUQ2I|5|Item worked great easy to install
B000FP0E2E|4|No Bolt included.  Also what ever that object in the center is, it is not in the package either.
B00RH3AMIS|5|These soft ties are very supple, well constructed and much easier to get into tight areas than more ridged designs. I give them a 10
B006H459GS|4|There's not a lot say about these, they look great and so far they're still on the wheels.<br /><br />Half of them get a lot of sun and I haven't noticed any fading so I'm pretty happy.
B004ZF43Y0|3|One light stopped working and still didn't work after bulb replacement.  Pulled the ballast out and water was coming out of it.  Not waterproof after all.
B00BSZ07UO|5|Exactly was it was supposed to be.
B002P3LLR6|5|First of all I Love Bobster Goggles, and for Shooting I Love the Bug Eyes But the other day I was in a low light environment, and had to take off my smokey lenses and put on some of those cheap BB gun glasses...Never Again! These Actually Brighten up what you are seeing, and have all the things I love about my other Bobster Bugeyes...They don't fog, they fit my face well, I have a Huge Head, and they don't reduce any of your sight range...
B009C2VAII|1|i ended up receiving a different helment that I didn't order and instead of sending it back I trated it for something eles so I was dissatisfied with the perches .
B006CQ5L6O|5|Very well built diff cover with built in seal and dipstick
B001JEK4KW|1|Don't let it fool you.  I was under the impression of getting this pad and arrived in my house without a pair!  They fail to mentioned that it comes by itself and not in pair.  Why would anyone buy a seat belt pad without a pair?  If I had just a seat in a car then it'd be OK.  That's why, I rate this to be a failure in detail or describe about this item or product.
B00P1C14E8|4|Great fabric and great fit overall. Its missing middle aisle middle seat cover. And the third aisle doesnt quite attach right due to its seat bottom shape. So the straps arent on right nor is the bottom of the cover seat. Holes need to be made through the top covers for the head rest to go on through. Overall well custom fit.
B0007OWD2M|5|This is the only thing I use for the car windows, house windows and mirrors.  I never have a problem with streaking and I've tried the spray bottle and the product in the can - both work exceedingly well! Tip: if the surface is extremely dirty, use this with toweling first to remove the vast majority of dirt. Then spritz and use microfiber towel, which reduces lint residue.
B00MSU5VUY|5|Fast shipment,everything as expected
B0040OJ652|1|they descript says they fit chevy pickup 2006 1500 4 door -there is no tab to properly fit behind the existing truck molding in the front so air will get quick under and pull the item off your vehicle- i tried to return this but the seller insisted i pay shipping again - i waited on an email to say wether that was negotiable but never got one back and missed the date i had to return it by - wasted money
B0053HPFDW|2|Very poor quality. initially it was okay, but  spewed water through the seal from the beginning.  Over time it doesn't work very effectively, and now the flow is such the engine sometimes overheats. Go with the Salt Away tool, NOT this one.
B00N6I4OEG|5|Works great.  Strong enough to not fall off when you rip off a few paper towels.  Keeps spray oil and brake cleaner nearby.  Holds small parts/tools that you are not currently using.  Good value.
B00JCOF0I2|5|They work great and are easily installed!
B001EOYIYK|5|I used the money I saved on this hitch to partially cover my Amazon Prime membership and got 2 day shipping for free.<br /><br />I have a 2009 Murano and DID NOT lower the exhaust.  A little bit of finesse and it fit in the spot just fine.  Now the hitch itself has holes that are supposed to match up to the frame.  They are close, but off by probably 1/4&#34;.  I used a crowbar to spread the fins enough to match the holes.<br /><br />Lastly it would be nice if it was secured in the box.  It slid around and punched a hole in the side of the box, but wasn't damaged.
B0038B48OW|5|So easy to install. Very noticeable on the truck itself and all lights are bright especially the reverse lights. No necessary adjustments or tweaking. I just highly encourage you to get lock for you tailgate. It was so easy to install that anyone can remove it with a 10mm socket. It would be a shame to pay for these lights and it can be gone in seconds.<br /><br />Installed on a 2008 Tacoma.
B006QZJHL6|1|My sand viper would not even run with product. I looked forward to installing the product to my buggy; very disapointed.
B0002M8QP2|5|This is a good product that will discourage anyone intent on stealing your car cover. I bought it after having the last one stolen.The cable would take some effort to break or disable, something most thieves are too lazy to try.
B004RPJWHQ|1|PUT THESE ON MY CAR AND THEY CORODED INSIDE AND WHEN I HAD A FLAT TIRE THEY GARAGE WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE THE VALVE CAP.  THEY TRIED EVERYTHING BUT IT WAS FIRMLY AND PERMANENTLY CORODED ONTO THE METAL STEM. HAD TO BE CUT OFF WITH A SAWZALL. THIS DESTROYED THE TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR.  I ENDED UP HAVING TO SPEND OVER $300 TO GET THEM ALL CUT OFF AND THE 4 SENSORS REPLACED.<br />WISH I HAD NEVER SEEN THEM. DO NOT PUT THESE ON YOUR CAR !!!!!!!!!
B001THSZYG|5|No more head bumping. Well made.
B0002SQUTU|5|Pretty durable. Just try not to use on single piston calipers. It will bend the aluminum and break. Had to straighten and tig back together.
B0009RLJFY|5|This controller replaced the one put on by the business where I bought my camper.  I wore out the disk brakes on my truck in one summer.  The necessary adjustments on the unit were not there.<br /><br />This one works great and the breaking is proportional.  Since there is a sensor to sense the truck brakes being applied and the force of the braking, you have to set the sensor up each time you connect to the camper.  This takes 30 seconds.  Well worth not having to replace my disk brakes each fall.
B004ZT6HDQ|5|Kit fit perfectly Performance restored, I am able to use the Rhino around the farm again.s in mind if I need any<br />I will keep these kit
B00413KDQ8|4|I wish these were softer and a flat finish. They are very hard, and shiny. But they do the job just fine.
B003VCDI7G|5|Fit my 2002 Chev Avalanche 2500 like a glove
B00E7JNPA2|3|Item received as shown and described.  As expected, no wiring diagram received.  This kit is for a person with an average or better  skill in car wiring with proper tools for crimping, soldering, etc.  It's odd to see the main power switch is rated for 20A but the push-button switch is rated for 30A.  3 cables were supplied; each cable is multi-strand type, 12-14 gauge (no rating found) and is about 3ft long.  The relay is rated for 30A and its cable is about 2ft long.  The 4 screws' diameter is larger than the mounting holes, so one would either enlarge the holes or use smaller screws.  I did not try to use the supplied screws as self-tapping because it might strip the screw heads to go through the 1/8\\" thick aluminum mounting plate.  I used this to replace my car ignition switch that caused the car engine to die intermittently.  So far after 3k miles, it's working OK with no problem. The main power switch status light would come on after turned on.  The kit is solidly built and decent to look at.  I gave it 3 stars for 20A main power switch and the small mounting hole diameters, otherwise a 5 star rating would be received.
B00P6OMPNA|5|Delivered on time as promised.  Item as described.  Thanks
B000Q754E4|5|Cooler cools down fairly rapidly (faster than the Igloo). Like the domed top so tall bottles can fit nicely.
B003GLH9BS|4|I really like this product. I got tired of spending money on typical air freshening gadgets, plug-in, sprays, candles, and automatic sprayers. Some just masked odors, some made the smells worse, some did virtually nothing and most did not last very long at all.<br /><br />I now keep odium in all of my bathrooms and they work quickly and effectively to get rid of poopy smells, especially useful when you have company or other visitors. I use ozium in the rest of my house to get rid of cooking smells and overall odors from everyday living. It works quite well on burnt smells but may take 2 or 3 applications to fully work. My house is over 4000 sq ft and although the product is quite expensive (less 1 star), I find that I use substantially less of this product than others I have tried. A short spray here and there has kept my house smelling quite good since I started using it.<br /><br />While I like the residual smell, it may not be for everyone...it smells sort of like a light licorice smell to me. After it has done what it is supposed to, you can open a nearby window to help neutralize the the light ozium smell pretty quickly.<br /><br />Some folks say to just clean your house and you will not have odors. Well, I have a clean house and would frequently air  it out by leaving the windows open in the spring and fall. However, it is hot as heck here in the summer and who wants windows open in the winter time. So ozium is particular great to have when it is not practical to leave a window open to let out foot smells, cooking odors and funk from gassy men and teen boys. I like to mainly use it at the end of the day, when everyone else has gone to bed. When we wake up, everything is fresh again and the ozium smell has also dissipated.<br /><br />As I stated before, I have dogs and have had no problems with using this product. I highly recommend it but just wish the price was a bit lower!!!
B000H9K4K0|5|The product is better that I was expecting<br />it is like covering the inside of your tank with glass
B00HHG910A|5|I've already used and love it! It's loud enough, too!
B006GFLI0O|5|Good quality product that'll keep the sweat out of your eyes!
B008I9O3FI|5|I got this because my old magnet emblem had seen better days and thought i could put this on my grill. I took my chevy emblem off, painted black behind it and put this dead center, i always see people checking it out and get a lot of compliments on it, ive had it for a few months now and its still in great condition even with some of the abuse it has seen!
B000H90XDS|5|It took around 24 hours to fully charge a weak battery on my Lexus RS350, meet my expectation and requirement.
B00I015NM6|5|Plug and play ballast. Fit like a glove and is definitely OEM Spec. Tested and a warrantied. Whats not to love about the product and seller.
B00QKT5AI2|5|Looks awesome. Lots of stares
B000F1Y0CS|4|Not a 100% perfect fit but they look great and are simple to install.  I would buy again; as a matter of fact I just ordered a set for our other old car.
B000UVGK5I|5|Form-fitting. Very insulating to light and heat. Perfect for my 2008 Highlander Hybrid. I love it. Glad I bought it, as I was tired of other products failing. Totally worth every penny.<br /><br />Only negative is storing it while driving, but I'm sure it's just my clumsiness -- I can't seem to fold it right to tuck away, so it's always just splayed in the back seat. Which is a problem when you've got passengers. :)
B00B32DCYK|5|Love these airbags; wish I had bought them years ago!!!!!! Excellent product for leveling and stabilizing my F-350, while towing 14K lb FW. Prompt delivery, fair price, easy installation!!!!!
B007LIBQ3O|5|comfortable
B006D9VZ60|5|This track bar is STOUT......  Compared to the stock it is like the difference between a 4 Penny nail and a 16 penny nail.  Road control improved.  Off road I noticed that my body shift is gone.  All I can attest that to is that the stock would flex and bend whereas the new one does not, keeping the axle in place.
B007J7DW6G|1|I love that they are Bengal mats.... But the color is off I didnt keep the paper and receipt that I had, or I would have tried to return these. And look for a better seat.  I have Bengal mayts in the front that is the right orange these look like a brown orange mix.  But still WHO DEY 4 Life.
B0002NYBC8|4|Had to buy an adapter to use this with my r12 system, but directions were clear and all went well. The system is now recharged and i will keep my fingers crossed that I don't have any more leakage!
B00F3KKSZY|1|they fibrate loose. you wont have on bike long. i wouldnt order these, no way shape or form pure junk
B003G8CL2I|2|I have a Dakota R/T. I notice nothing in way of power or performance. It does make a bit of a whistle sound on acceleration  but nothing drastic. Save your money IMHO.
B001O04880|5|Don't hesitate if you need one of these lights.  Over 100 bucks any where else.  Only took five minutes to install.
B003IS3HV0|1|I purchased this Leather Honey Conditioner with some trepidation, after reading the comparatively few negative feedbacks, left by dissatisfied customers. I tried to contact the seller with questions, but they don't answer their phones during regular business hours, so I left a message to return my call. They didn't return my call and instead sent an email with instructions! I followed their advice and applied the conditioner to an inconspicuous small area, inside the cuff of one of a brand new, very expensive pair of imported fine lambskin, shearling leather gloves. As you can see from my photo, the conditioner significantly changed the beautiful, rich chocolate brown color, to a very dark, almost black color. This product won't work for my particular application, as I don't want to ruin the color of my new gloves! In my opinion, this overpriced conditioner doesn't live up to all the positive hype and reinforces the negative comments, already left by other dissatisfied customers. I will be returning this product to Amazon, IMMEDIATELY!
B003125M1Q|3|With easy 3 bolt attachment, I planned to install and go riding.  Didn't work that way.  Turns out that the center mount hole is mis-aligned with the attachment point for the motorcycle (mine is a 2011 Yamaha Star V 250).  I sent an e-mail to the manufacturer and got no response so I called after several hours.  Turned out that everyone goes to lunch at the same time so I had to wait for a call back.  I talked with the customer service person for almost 15 minutes and at his direction took and e-mailed 6 very clear pictures.  They didn't want me to modify the bar to fit and talked about getting another Yamaha bike in to check fit and such to figure out what to do after agreeing that I had the correct product and it should fit my bike. Some time later they called me and we  talked for over 8 minutes.  I was told that the hole showed in the picture as being \\"very close\\" to where it should be.  Yeah, it was, but not close enough.  They weren't interested in sending a new bar so I told them that I would go to Lowe's, buy a Dremel milling bit and make the bar fit.  The customer service guy kept saying they hadn't had any prior complaints and I responded that most folks probably drilled the hole out without calling but I didn't want to remove the chrome plating or void their warranty.  The customer service guy acknowledged that that was likely the case.  This is a hand-built product and the hands got it wrong for mine.  The customer service people figure that their product is perfect.  It isn't always.  Plan on spending some extra money to get the milling bit and plan on spending a bunch of extra time to install.  However, don't plan on spending any time calling customer service because your bar still won't fit after burning through that time.
B001TJZ6IC|5|This is a great product for the price. The seat covers fit absolutely perfect, and gave my vehicle an instant makeover.
B003EP0U4O|4|Looks good and fit like a champ!!<br /><br />I would buy this again if needed. Shipping was fast and cheap!  Also would recommend this to any one looking for extened flares.
B000V53UV0|5|This dish is unbelievable.  It sets up in just a few minutes and gives a beautiful picture.  This is a BEST BUY.
B00BAOFV0Y|5|Despite its size its a very strong and sturdy switch the biggest plus is template for mounting it is included and instructions make it as easy as possible
B00WEGX262|4|came with no instructions on how to change battery. had to figure out how to set it. not too hard. it is currently installed. tried it a couple times, alarm seems somewhat loud. first bump, it lets out three chirps. after that it becomes alnost too sensitive.it does shut off after about 10- 15 seconds.
B008PJDOSS|5|Great price, perfect fit
B005OY9F8U|5|Delivered fast and was very easy to apply. This was for my wife's birthday present and she  loved it on her truck.
B0009OMYH4|5|I have no formal training as a mechanic so this is a novice review of this product.<br />I needed a compression tester to test the compression on my little weedeater BV200 blower that had a loose cylinder head that I had resealed and tightened.  Some blogs I read stated I needed to see something like 90PSI compression on the head and this device allowed me to test.  First try it had 50 PSI so I tore the unit apart and found the seal had slipped when tightening it down.  I replaced the piston rings and re-sealed/tightened head down and the tester now reads 85-90psi after testing with this unit.  This little device did what it was advertised to do for my application.<br />The company shipped the product promptly, the packaging was good and it was received in good shape.
B001NJ3H0C|5|Over one month and still works great.
B000RTG012|5|Most Snap-on tools are well thought out and this is no exception.  The red metal grating pops open and it's easy to seat any bulb rated up to 75 watts.  The detachable plug is a smart way to go and makes for better portability / storage.  Also, there's the pass through plug so you can run a power tool off of the light.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Solid design and performance, will last decades in any garage.
B00ADQBG8Q|5|This was very handy in the Tacoma. With the driver seat forward, my wife had trouble attaching the seat belt. The extender solved the problem.  Be sure to check with the supplier. There are a bunch of sizes and shapes of these things.
B001JT35XU|4|It's a cable - nothing special.  It works fine.
B004YZEJ18|1|Once I was able to find a replacement part, (a bearing the wrong size) it was just fine. For someone not familiar with mechanics is would be a nightmare trying to force the shaft through the too small bearing, eventually there would be four  options: return it, file the shaft to fit, try to get the seller to get the right bearing, or find one yourself. The last iscwhat I did since I did not want to wait possibly weeks to negotiate.
B0002MA8TE|1|The first time I went to install my Karpak two of the straps ripped right off.  Now I am having trouble getting anyone to answer my customer service inquiry.  It says right in the warrenty that this would be covered, but no one answers my e-mails.  Therefore, at this point I would not recommend purchasing this item.
B00230JUTW|5|Love these! looked everywhere for these in YZ Blue, Powersport Superstore had them for an Excellent price & free shipping! AWESOME FOLKS! I Highly Recommend Buying from them.
B0000AZ771|5|Does the job that is as much as I can say until I get more to say about that ok
B006JG5BLM|5|I bought this after a friend came over to inflate my tires with a similar model. No more having to PAY for air at a rip off gas station!  I put this in the back of my crv and I will never have to worry when the tire pressure light goes on again.  It is easy to use and no more rushing around trying to get all the tires before you have to PAY another dollar for air.
B000AY698S|5|Great and fast shipment
B0013GHBAM|5|The mirror was for my wife*s car and she absolutely loves it<br />Now she can see both sides of the car
B000CMJJYO|5|I do not have any reason not to give it 5 stars. It is not fancy with and rubber inside to grab the spark plug, but it does it job. Keep in mind this kit does not have below 2 things that you may need,<br />- Tool to open the Bolts on top of the sparkplug cover<br />- Tool/magnet to grab the sparkplug out.
B00R8PZ5GY|5|Works great!have trouble with the cord connection sometimes.cord could stand to be a little longer though.
B0035XLA26|3|I really liked the bottom sticker but the top on is not a circle the sticker is the whole thing.  So I was just eh about it.  My husband wants to take it off.  We'll see
B002HK2892|5|Our old wheel covers were toast, one missing.  Bought these and couldn't be happier, they look great, popped right on with no problems.  Good buy from Amazon.
B00ELJ9A3O|3|thought they were bigger! my mistake. I didn't read measurements correctly
B00AR334B2|4|These gloves were everything I expected. Not too great of material (actual glove flakes off to reveal it was glued onto mesh, but only in some spots), the metal parts are actually real metal. Nice and shiny too! The gloves should have had sizes. I am 18 years of age and I have normal size hands and these were too big for me! Definitely not for children!!!!
B00E429E2K|5|I had to return them, they were too big, but, loved them!!!
B004ZF32QK|5|Relatively easy to install even after a few brewskies....lol..., Instructions need to be a bit easier ...no not the beer talking they are a bit confusing, very good quality...I like that you took the care and packaged them in a nice case...not htat i will ever use the thing again but it shows your quality standard which is impressive. OMG these MFr's are bright as hell. I love them. Great for an old man like me. Now i can see at night. Peronaally i got the 4300k...and love them...I hope they last....Great Job Kensun
B009SI2SQ4|4|quality is acceptable especially with the rated price<br />very nice<br />workes very well<br />noticed from distances<br />can be used in different cars or bikes<br />i used it on my Sports Arial Atom car<br />amazing looks
B008FUAUI4|5|Same part you can purchase at the Jeep dealer for a fraction of the cost.  Installation was extremely simple
B00F0VABRG|5|great very happy
B002R1PK5K|4|Great direct fit replacement, and includes the big round plastic piece that holds the ballast. Side marker lamp fitting was different from the 2002 this replaced, so I just had to re-use the original socket. Hopefully yours is still intact.
B001G7RUXG|5|I went to all the auto parts stores in my area and none of them had the part I needed. I checked on amazon and there it was.
B00A8MZ52I|5|Great big fluffy microfiber towels, these things are almost like a bath towel. I use them for mostly the last wipe before final buffing but they are becoming my go to towels. Any product from Chemical Guys is a winner!
B007T2JAFS|4|Good quality. Works as intended. the 5 watts are not very visible in daylight but looks great in the evening and at night. Plug and play.
B00158SFNK|1|I have had to buy 2 of these and both fried in the first 24 hrs. Will not buy it again!!!
B000JZZ8CG|5|This was extremely easy to put on my car and super affordable. It just clicked right in place with no extra effort.
B00FFRM0M4|5|Great deal, good quality lenses, fit perfectly on my 2001 Harley Ultra Classic, very happy with this purchase! Definitely recommend!!!
B00DBCPRZW|5|is a very useful article and not had any problems with it, I hasido very useful for the necessary one good quality article
B00COYNZJ8|5|Who wouldn't love to ride with these guys!
B001EZ2KZ8|5|These are the best wipers available! The last set lasted for YEARS...sold the car after they were on for 4 years and they were still working like new!  I expect these will, also. You'll see better, longer, and save money in the long run...they're a far better value, amortized over the life of the wiper, than anything else you can buy!
B000C7Y6XI|5|I highly recommend this product to everyone, even though is not original, it fits and works perfect on my xterra 2000 se
B00L22F2E4|5|Every things Just fine.
B000SNK7HK|5|Shipped as promised. Better quality than I could have bought at the store. Put them on my truck. Love them!
B0057UJEFU|5|it is an amazing product, good for cleaning a variety of surfaces....learned about it by accident years ago and no local store carries it in greater las vegas nv area to my knowledge any more.  took a chance and tried amazon and hooray, you have it.<br /><br />good for  furniture, carpets, drapes, clothes, etc.  have never tried wallpaper but bet it would work well too.<br /><br />thanks for your wisdom in carrying this product for those of us who continue to enjoy its benefits.litt<br /><br />ps...very important....no yucky odor!!!!!!
B008SUZIGU|5|Works well.  Just make sure shape the fiberglass to a point before you use it, if you are doing super detailed work.
B000CIMP12|5|ok
B002Y0CLWE|5|Perfect fit for customers 2005 Scion TC at a great price.
B008O6UHA0|5|Quick delivery, very easy to assemble. It is extremely stable going down the road. loads easily. only negative is it didn't come with the hitch pin.
B000NPUJQC|3|Overpriced but good
B009CNYJG2|5|Works very well and feels like good quality.<br /><br />I did not test it at very high voltages/currents as most of the work I do is in the USB range.<br /><br />Thanks
B004VDTFIK|5|I have a black 2005 Chevy Colorado and these chrome mirror covers looks great. They installed very easily and they fit perfectly.  I am very happy with my purchase.
B009FNWMDQ|4|As expected.
B000FGJR1W|5|This is a heavy duty cleaner. Whats not to like about K&N. You are going to get your bang for the buck. Nothing goes better with a Harley.
B0041TOPGG|5|A perfect, brand-new, OEM quality starter for half the price you would pay for a re-manufactured starter from one of the large auto parts chains. Installed as expected, and all necessary pieces were included. I just wish I knew what to do with the old core, as there is no way to recycle it that I'm aware of.
B001P22UUU|5|Not much to say about these, they do as they say they do. Good plastic too
B004G79XS8|4|Snapped on easy after figuring them out the first time.  I strongly recommend buying the rubber straps for tension tightening the chains. (They don't grip easily on the road without the rubber straps.).  They were valuable for the price.
B006P1ZW0Q|5|Bought  this for my husband's birthday ! He loved it . Well worth the money.
B0094BG9SS|5|I use these straps to secure my SUP (stand up paddleboard). I can now stop at the store or run errands on my way home from a paddle! I have even used these straps to leave my board on the car overnight for an early morning paddle the next day. The straps have 2 braided stainless cables inside compared to 1 in the Thule straps. When I was shopping for security straps, I read nothing but good reviews on these straps and ran into several negative reviews on the Thule ones. They do cost more, but they are a much better strap. I no longer worry about running into the store with these straps securing my board. Well worth the cost!
B000C5DUN2|5|Exact replacement for cruise control on our 2004 Ford Sport Trac, Easy to install and function well.
B003VASQBQ|2|Easy to install. Looks nice.<br />However, it leaks a few tablespoons of water when first used on cold mornings.<br />Suspect that there is a gasket in it which is not as good when cold<br />It does not appear to be repairable
B000Z79FEA|5|This is well worth the money. The only thing I was confused by is the big rubber bumper they give you separately that looks like it goes on the end of the cable above the loop to cushion the hook when it hits the winch but there doesn't seem to be any way to get it on the cable. Great value otherwise. I've already ordered another one.
B001C3B2D8|5|This product works very well when you are trying to take your lid off. It is a bit of hassle to connect it when getting on the bike though.<br /><br />The only other bad thing I would say about it is that is pinches hair out of my beard! Be careful about that!
B00DDL4GY4|3|Product does not stick properly. Edges keep raising and would get caught on clothing. I personally would not buy again.
B0069ICPRI|5|Worked great on my 05 Tahoe. I had to trim the one hanger so it wouldn't rub against frame. Great sound not to loud and obnoxious for my family ride. Just the correct tone. Glad I purchased it.
B000P0XMKK|5|A must have for taking off the harmonic balancer off a GM 3.8.
B00538TU8C|5|worked great
B001IA5ZUG|1|I received a strut mounting kit but not the one shown in this picture. The one I received is round in shape and did not fit and now I can't return or get a refund! I had to wait for my other parts to come before I could have it installed. So disappointed :-(
B0068ODC1Q|5|This key fob worked as hoped and expected. It was delivered in a relatively short time and was very reasonably priced. Good deal!
B0042MXYAU|5|It was great! Came in before the expected day, super easy to apply and I love it! Looks really cute on my car! Defiantly worth it! 👍
B0072SU38W|5|I haven't burned this one up yet. works good, just need better dry cells. I'm running to cells in series off of this PWM.
B000VKN4R0|5|Great product.  Easy to install.  Timken is a top brand and I was able to buy two online for the price of one at a auto parts store.
B004PJMPFA|5|I would like to comment that the information given in the advertisement was adequate for me to exactly identify that the starter was the one I needed. The product was delivered in the shortest time.
B009E9K5QM|5|The product was easy to program and very efficient. The only thing I was confused on was how to program two<br />remotes at once. I still can't do til this day, but overall a success.
B00G4RUP8K|4|Worked fine. Probably didn't have the expertise to apply it
B002EOVDII|3|lets just say you get what you pay for. i bought this for about $2. i wasnt expecting the best and i was right. after about a few months it stopped working and broke. lasted me a while for just $2 though.
B004E5GBJG|5|Works & Fits Well.  I leave it on while the RZR is loaded on our truck.  Don't read the directions throw them away. Its not hard to install unless you look at the directions.
B000C10E1W|5|Buen producto....
B00068OR14|4|good product
B000CITK8S|5|This battery tender comes with all types of connectors that you could want for connecting this up to a motorcycle battery (in my case) or a car battery for recharge or winter storage (in my case).<br /><br />If your motorcycle has battery tender outputs directly from the battery, you could easily connect this device to your bike without removing the battery.  Or, the terminal leads that come with this module could be installed on your bike and directly connect to the charger when needed.<br /><br />Jumper Cable style connectors are a plus if you are in a pinch and want to quickly charge a battery without the work of removing it / adding other attachments to the terminals.
B00C2DSG8G|3|The door handle fits exactly, but there was not any instructions on how to attach. The hardware was included, but was not very effective, especially without any instructions.
B000CM0WW2|3|I thought the mirror was just fine, but I don't drive,my son says that it appears to be a carnival mirror.  As far as the dilivery of the mirror it arrived on time.  I was satisfied but he wasn't.
B002FY63S2|5|The headlight fit my buick century great and was easy ti install, It works great and I received it on schedule.
B003H2RKI8|5|I appreciate doing business with you. I love the Philippine Flag banner hanging on my car mirror. Thanks for the excellent offer.
B007NZ0LD6|4|good stuff!
B006FMB7H2|5|Just what the doctor ordered.  It is a great product, with a great price and with fast shipping.  I recommend this to all who need one.
B0002JMUZW|5|OEM on these filters seem to click in better. This was no exception. Perfect.
B001EB9XZC|5|Smoothest shifts, quietest engine noise out of any oil I have tried in my 2000 Triumph Trophy 1200
B00KV6HKL0|1|did not fit my Jeep GC 2001. I would advise the manufacturer/person selling to tell buyers these things so that they don't develop a bad rep.
B004Q4ZOIY|5|These shocks are absolutely awesome! They perform as well as they look and I would highly recommend them to family, friends and strangers. Made right here in the US, which is rare. They're expensive but well worth every penny. They're also easy to install.
B001TNMWBM|5|I bought these to spray over PVC ID badges to make them last longer. Works very well, everything should be dusted very well before spraying because it will make the tiniest dust particle big and noticeable with the many layers you spray. So far no scratches or fading in use for two months in a harsh manufacturing environment.
B009DK1L38|4|Great part. Fit perfectly
B001872LFG|4|easy to install on 2000 Toyota Corolla<br />I had bought one before for the passenger side, so I came back to this seller for this one<br />cost Much less than other places I looked<br /><br />color match was dead on<br />came quick in the mail
B001JT58GM|5|Works great
B003RWPP9Y|2|This remote, once I got it working is great, but getting it and getting it to work was a pain.<br /><br />First, USPS has the worst service and I would prefer UPS. The remotes arrived but I was at work and so had to wait over theekend to get it at the post office atfter waiting in line for almost an hour. I can't hold this against the company that sells these remote except I paid almost 5 dollars per remote to ship. So, one less star for service.<br /><br />Once i got it I immediately tried to program the remote. After about an hour of trying I gave up and seached online for programming instructions. They sent me the wrong instructions AND the instructions they did send caused a blown fuze.<br /><br /> Minus 2 stars for that.<br /><br />The only real saving grace is that when I finaaly got it to work, it works fine.
B0030DISUI|5|great product really good price fast shipping spot on seller
B005LRDBM6|5|I've bought these before, and they are very good.
B00EPKZAQU|5|My son loves his helmet. Perfect fit & finish. Would definitely recommend this helmet to anyone looking for a youth helmet
B001JT5QNW|5|Excellent all the way around.
B009VOQ05U|4|Unless you are inventive and like to fabricate.<br /><br />The rack itself is of excellent quality, given its price.  Toyota apparently did not intend folks to install a rack on this truck, however.  The plastic caps on the siderails are not meant to support anything of this nature, and the metal underneath is thin and has many perforations.<br /><br />I knew this going in.  My plan was to put a &#34;C&#34; rail bracket under the plastic, and bolt through it.  That was not practical, once I had the caps off and the rack on hand.  There is no reasonable way to bolt through, and hold the nuts from underneath.  I resorted to bolting the brackets to the bedrail, with threaded holes with bolts pointed up, to hold the rack.  This worked acceptably well, but took the better part of two days to work out all the details on the brackets.<br /><br />Would I do it again?  Yes I would.  Would I recommend someone else doing it?  Generally not a DIY project.........If you have plenty of fabrication experience, and are willing to invent the wheel, go for it.  But do not expect it to be easy.
B00A0K4V4G|5|Shoes came and fit well.  They were as I expected. I think some people thought they were a little snug, but I actually found them to have just a little wiggle room.  I wear a size 9.
B00CZG6WO0|5|great price and unit looked very close to the original. they work much cooler than the original. Much better price than I could find locally
B001CF6LVE|5|covers our tire
B008LX474I|5|Odered with standard shipping on Thursday and it arrived the very next day. Fits my 2007 Hummer H3 perfectly and only took 5 minutes to install all four pieces. Very happy with the product.
B0040M31H8|5|Nice solid accessory for my bike!
B0024NWX4C|5|You've seen them on the road. Maybe they're on your Grand Am right now. You know, those yellow, foggy, hideous looking headlight assemblies that looks like products of the late 80's. This is where these brand new assemblies come into play. In a word, these things are refreshing. Who knew such pure light could come from a Grand Am? The set comes with a pair of headlights, but I opted to continue using my Sylvanias from before and hold on to the others in case of a blown bulb in the future. The light emanated from the bulbs looks clear and crisp when being beamed out of this new assembly. For me, the high beams weren't too great and actually never have been from before. But these are rarely used so no big deal.<br /><br />The one negative is the poor design of the Grand Am's headlight assembly. It took some effort, and then some more, to get these in properly. I'm not even sure if they're 100% in correctly, but close enough will do. The difference is stark when comparing the old foggy headlights with these new clear ones. Unlike the old ones, these are easier to adjust, and adjusting you will have to do. It probably took me two or three tries to get them to the alignment that was appropriate for the road. Once I did, it was as if new life was breathed into the front end of my car. Not only do they look great when the lights are on, they also look good when they are off.<br /><br />I looked at these for months while contemplating the purchase. Ultimately, there's nothing to contemplate. You're looking at these for a reason friend. Buy them and you won't be diappointed.
B00TA5ECJQ|5|Excellent product at an excellent price.  I wish I would have had this product years ago.  It works so well that I am buying one for my dad, my brother, and a friend.
B000C9SRD6|5|This is the twist on type not the push in and turn one turn deal. works great.
B00030DLEE|5|Perfect for heating up leftovers on the go. Love it.
B007GCY1UU|5|It took me about 30 minutes to install...very easy and a very solid product as i have used it numerous times with no trouble...Easy to pull out and tuck back in....
B001MM8QZ6|5|they just plugged in like the other lights, and boy they use very little electric the meter does not drop when all are on, and are 3x brighter.
B000TYLUVK|5|Great service and product
B003SOKEXI|5|Finally Power Mirrors!!!  For I don't know how long I didn't have power mirrors. And it was something so cheap and simple.
B007OWGA4C|1|these came broken, they are a big waste of money, sound activation does not work. i returned them, this product SUCKS.
B000KKOGLO|2|Electric stove-top coils produce a lot of heat. Eventually, the receptacles for these coils deteriorate from the heat, and have to be replaced -- generally after quite a few years or use.<br /><br />These cost less than similar receptacles at a leading hardware chain, were in stock, and were delivered in a few days. They came with all the necessary hardware, and if you are careful, and make sure the power is turned off while you are working, fairly easy to install.<br /><br />The problem is that the plastic in the main body of these receptacles broke down from the heat in a matter of months, and the contacts that \\"grab\\" the end of the coils loosened. It became tricky to replace the coil after removing it to clean under and around it. The coil became unreliable, and sometimes sparked.<br /><br />I've had better results and longevity with the more expensive units at the local store, but if you are very careful when removing and replacing the coils into the recepticle, you may have better results.
B00A4XAXC8|3|Not a whole lot of space to do much with this.
B00KXAZD18|5|Honestly, I was kinda disappointed when I didn't get the 2 supreme stickers. But they did provide another sticker that was really dope! I'm super glad that I bought these. Gonna buy more later!
B003XYNDC2|5|Great sticker.
B0023VEWXU|5|The fog light fit perfectly and works great.
B00ERI9X0E|5|This sticker was perfect for my FJ Cruiser which has a wide variety of Star Wars &#34;flair&#34; on it already.
B00GEIAJCQ|5|Great oil for the price
B00J46JP3E|5|The Touch Up Paint was exactly what I needed; my car is old(2003), but still does very well.  After washing it and using the paint, it looks like anew car.  Thank you.  rmh
B000KL55Z4|5|5/5 stars, used this to mount up a kenwood indash into my 2001 impreza 2.5rs, nice quality, decent wires, plugged right into my stock radio harness!
B000C5UFOY|5|Installed it on my 2004 Toyota Tacoma Re-Runner and the engine light went away never to return.  It was a little tricky to install, since you had to splice the wires, but anyone who knows what it means to splice wires and is competent enough to change the oil could handle this repair.
B000ML8XDI|5|So cute my Tinkerbell loving daughter is going to love them! Thumbs up! Durable looking not cheesy or cheap<br />Great deal!
B00HWFJDGS|5|Very nice and worth the price.
B002SIR91A|2|Shovel handle was too short making use of it to be back breaking.  Quality was not what I expected.
B00FTDJ9FA|1|Original factory light bulbs light up the area to the rear of the vehicle a lot better than these LED's only difference is the color of the light. Brightness  color
B006VZG5X4|5|Fit perfect on my Kawasaki ninja 250r 09...I broke my other one but this fit perfect easy to install just screw on
B0037GHCR8|5|We like the look of these better than the Honda covers.  They fit our Fit perfectly.
B0038L7650|5|Bought for 1998 BMW 940I.<br /><br />Pop out the old and snap in the new. Nice update.<br /><br />Recommend.<br /><br />I updated the parking lamps to clear and the tail lights to LEDs. Car has total new look.
B001Q3AZL4|5|Excellent deal
B004GCFHR4|5|As expected.
B00JG2J6YO|5|excelent
B00CNDZGEW|1|I bought these lights for my 07 Chevy Silverado DRL back in Dec. 2013. It is now Aug 2014 and about 50% of the LEDs on one and about 60% on the other. That is no where the usual limits for LEDs. I have to reinstall the original lights.
B000NTE6LW|5|Ford could just as easily provided new springs to about fifty cents each to solve the problem....  Part worked well.
B004WBAYCM|1|i bought one of these for an irradicate speedometer on my montecarlo and it broke within 3 weeks.  these may work for a month or so but are actually much worse then the original defective GM ones. avoid these at all cost! they will most likely break within a year and you'll have to take the cluster apart for another repair. get the white GM ones they sell on ebay. their are numerous sellers selling them for around $5 apiece. i did and hav'nt had any problems since
B000GGTQVW|5|the por15 products work very well
B00EHIOOBW|4|These are nice but they are Kensun HIDs with another label on them
B0022ZT69C|5|love yuasa batteries  hope they last
B000UVUAFO|3|Bought it for a 15 year old car with metallic paint.    followed instructions.  Some lighter scratches it took care of.  The deep ones came right back after one wash.    It works but don't excpect too much.
B005NLQAHS|5|No issues whatsoever getting the tool connected and using the app. This is a great diagnostic tool.
B000BFR6TM|5|Took longer to set up my ladder than install this shroud. Holes lined up perfect on my older Coleman Mach rooftop. Twice as thick as the original Coleman shroud, and has grill over coil at rear of shroud. Great purchase.
B00503L36W|5|Items seemed to be good quality and were installed without difficulty.  Packaging was less than adequate for the shipment.  Items moved in box and \\"poked through\\" the end.  Obliterated the ONLY product identification tag on container.  Enclosed instructions were incomplete (missing stated second enclosure) and too vague to be much help to other than experienced mechanic.  Great product, poor packaging and instructions.
B003D5VQOS|1|It was suppose to arrive dec 7 2011. It is now dec 9 2011 now they say shipment delayed. Item received to wrong facility
B0002V9LAW|5|Restores &#34;like new&#34; shine to most finishes, a must have for all boy toys!  Great product when used as suggested, highly recommended.
B005EIZNH8|4|Good quality small badges. Perfect for what I needed them for. If you are looking for a badge for the hood or trunk, look elsewhere... These are much too small.
B000FGECW6|4|After 4 years, became defective (constantly chirped).  Loved the idea that I could find the EXACT model to replace my defective one in my motorhome so I didn't have to replace the bracket.  Wished it had been priced a little cheaper, but paid for the convenience of just snapping it in place of the old one.
B00B8BFJ06|5|my husband liked it so much he ordered one for his car (same designer, different shiba plate frame)
B0002MA8TE|5|We purchased this item about 2 months ago but just a chance to use it over Christmas.  We traveled to another state, almost 600 miles away, speeds of 70-80 MPH, AND we only have 2 cross bars on our vehicle. This item is PERFECT! Even though it's recommended to have 4 bars to secure it on top of your vehicle, 2 bars will work as well. Ours didn't not move at all, it was very secure.  (We used additional straps, along with the ones that came in the box to secure it even more)  We had a huge suitcase, a large duffel bag, a large tote bag, 2 blankets, and 18 gallon tote, and there was STILL room left!  If you are thinking about purchasing this item, I would HIGHLY recommend it! It's more than half the price of one of those hard case cargo units and it's so easy to install, and very durable! It also folds up really nicely for storage.
B00895EX7Y|4|Very happy with this budget headset. I like the individual volume adjustments. The push-to-talk button on the ear cup really reduced wire clutter in the cockpit. I haven't done an all day flight, and probably won't in my little Luscombe, but for the hour plus flights I've done it has been plenty comfortable. I'll have to wait and see how the flexible boom holds up, but so far so good.
B00VGL7Z5A|5|easy to connect for the 2.5&#34; hitch.
B00FPBAW3E|4|Switch is hard to turn on and off.
B000O824Y8|5|About as basic a tool as one could buy. Works just fine and will outlive me I'm sure. Priced right.
B001Y8NEX2|1|Fell apart after a few months.
B005FKTC36|3|I recive bouth front disc and ceramical pars but i Dont recive rear discs and ceramical pats.
B00KTIZK30|5|Makes locking the beast up way easier!
B0067UEKOY|4|Used this on my 2005 Ford Focus Wagon. The unit was exactly as advertised and seems to be of good quality. I had to go to YouTube to get a better description on how to replace (needed to pry the engine forward a few inches with a lever). Very pleased.
B000CO8XXU|5|I paired these pads with EBC slotted and dimpled rotors on my 2006 Mustang (the EBC pads were much more expensive).  I drove the combination 80,000 street miles before they both needed to be replaced.  This included two seasons of autocross.<br />Street braking performance is consistently excellent, even in wet or snowy conditions.  Seasoned track instructors were surprised at how effective my brakes were on such a relatively heavy car.<br />At 140,000 miles I replaced all 4 corners with the same brake combination, plus braided stainless lines.  Looking forward to another exciting 80,000 miles!
B00JY07PRI|5|I thought this would require a &#34;hack&#34; install but the sticky back strip actually is the exact width of the opening on the awning creating a flush install. It gives plenty of light at night and comes with a remote to turn on and off- I wired it directly into a 12v light on my RV
B001PYTK7O|5|good quality good price
B006ZPP680|5|This product was exactly as described, made of high quality materials, and shipped promptly by the seller exactly as promised.  It met the exact needs for which it was purchased.  This is a part for classic mustangs that can be hard to find and it's polished, new look replaces a highly visible part in a classic car that immediately improves the interior look of the car.  The installation is a bit tricky, but that would be true where ever this replacement part were purchased.  Highly recommended for those who are restoring beloved Ford classic cars who want a pristine, clean interior that approximates the original look when the car was new.
B00HNYPB96|5|Easy to install everything worked great
B002R1872I|4|The product is at a good price for the quality. Not as good at a factory replacement. Have purchased both and compared.
B0020OJBPY|5|It's hot but it keeps you safe wen ordering always order one size Biger
B00L3OVOT8|5|Very nice
B006M465TS|5|i have used this battery for my system for the over 5 yrs and never had a problem.  I would recommend is item.
B001EMBSQI|3|I take good care of all my stuff, including this, didn't overuse it, never dropped it, but 2 months before its first birthday,it is malfunctioning. It is under warranty, but I'd rather have the 10# scale, so I won't send it in. It is easy to use. I love Amazon though! Where do I review Amazon?! It is so great to go back & have a receipt for what I've bought for the last few yrs!Love the navigation through the website. Here I go again- I'm supposed to be reviewing this scale!
B003159R1O|4|It is nice to get exactly what you ordered. Thank you.This item came quick. It was easy to install. You should get one
B0077R38TE|5|I use these antenna balls to help me find my car in a big parking lot.  This guy is great.  He is solid and bright and easy to spot AND best of all no one has stolen him yet.  He fits on nice and tightly
B00VDR6YEK|5|much improved, now I can see my dash at night!
B000CORUUW|5|Authentic, high quality Moog replacement coil springs. Price, communications, and speed of shipping were excellent.
B00BSV72G0|5|Very pleased, good quality, bright, perfect fit.
B007EUKP18|5|Good quality for the price but try to make shore that it feets you year model send a message to seler if possible.  Thanks (CSR)
B000HT4KRI|1|Doesn't work properly,not quality tool!
B000C7Y9MQ|2|Electronic part wrapped in plastic no box. Looks used. Have yet to insall and test. Hoping for the best.  Passes visual inspection.
B00GOA2ML0|5|these are the good ones with a heavy removable protective cover that makes installation a snap . stripes look good
B000CB1WAE|3|all good
B00LNOK4E4|2|A couple of things......<br /><br />1.  The lights aren't very bright during the day.  Yes, you can see them, but the inner rings are much, much brighter than the outer rings (the halo around the main lamps).  That is to say, that even the inner halos aren't that bright during the day.  At night, they light up much better, but what light wouldn't look better at night.  The factory H8 bulb is significantly brighter during the day.<br /><br />2. MOST IMPORTANTLY - On my '08 BMW 550i, these lights triggered the error message on the iDrive system stating that both of the driving lamps were not working.  It would trigger the right-side error message about 5 min after turning on the car and then trigger the left side about a minute later.  However, both lamps were on the entire time.  Neither lamp flickered when turning the car on and off.  Strangely, the error message did not occur when the headlamps were turned on.  In addition, after both errors &#34;dinged&#34;, I could turn on the main headlamps and both errors would disappear.  But having the tale-tell &#34;ding&#34; come on 3 times (one for each side and then once when you turn the car off) was highly annoying.  I'd much rather deal with the generic yellow, factory bulb.<br /><br />Needless to say, I ended up taking both of these bulbs out and bought the generic H8 bulb to replace the one that was blown.
B00252928M|5|Good quality filter at a great price.  Comes with an  additional foam layer under the paper element
B003DA4NFM|5|Eventhough the package is not clear on what vehicle these lugs will fit, until you actually read the package upon arrival. Just knowing what size will fit your vehicle will suffice. They worked real good with my GM car.<br />Thanks
B003CRUI96|5|fits my Suzuki samurai works good little loose but great price
B00KZD8JV4|5|Fast delivery, excellent product and easy installation!  I had just received a quote to install these kind of lights for a labor cost of $150 and that didn't include the parts.  I looked these up, ordered them and installed them myself within minutes!  You can also adjust (spin) the logo around as needed.  Excellent!
B00EDWF1BE|5|great product
B000CMF5ME|5|Geat for homebrewers.  I use them to make a &#34;poor man's&#34; carbonator cap.  Drill a hole in the top of a two liter bottle and add an air chuck to your CO2 line and you don't have to spend $15 / each for expensive caps.
B00AKI45EE|5|This is a nice medium sized ashtray, and can be used indoors or outside.  It matched the Tiki Decor perfectly on the deck.
B001T9AFBK|5|Works great on all rubber products.
B00FADDOL4|5|This is a GREAT product! I was shocked at how small it is, but man, it's awesome! At first the directions on how to program and customize your settings were tough to grasp, but I just stopped over thinking it and it was VERY easy. I was amazed at the simplicity of this chip, it does so much and yet it's so small and far less expensive than other modules I've seen that cost twice as much and only have a fraction of features/settings! This is a MUST buy if you're looking for brake light flasher. Highly, highly recommended.
B009GXJ2C4|4|Regardless these come without a ballast, which makes them  useless, and I had to wait a lifetime for the ship arrives from China, the quality seems to be good, and the high/low toggling seems to be right. The light is Ok,  Regards from Costa Rica.
B0006FKFMC|5|This product works really well on dents without creases in the metal.  I used it on my motorcycle tank and now you have to really look hard to see where the dent was. I would highly recommend this product.
B0089TPURC|4|I loved it just that I wished it had instruction that came with the product but easy to figure out and easy to put on
B000CCG082|5|I would like to thanks amazon.com for the fast delivery, I got this Muffler on 2 days after they shippment, and my country far away I live in United Arab Emirates. I put this Muffler on my Nissan Maxima 2010 and really it's a perfect sound and I liked the quality of this product. In my country it's not legal to put like that but the sound it's not loud so it's okay for me and for the police policy xD, the sound so deep and sexy tone ^-^.<br /><br />for the people they have Maxima 09 - 13 this is the product for your cars guys
B007XYG0XM|5|Quality is fine.  Price is LOW.  Warm on the motorcycle and style is rebel without a cause good.  Best value going.
B0021Z5WAA|5|Provides a beautiful shine on my Black Silverado.<br />Easily applied and results in a great looking vehicle.<br /><br />As with any polish you need to tape off any plastic trim<br />as it will discolor it.
B0039H66U4|4|Easy to install, good sound, dome lights very cheap. Overall good value.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Exactly what I expected. be sure to mask your painted areas correctly.
B0002Z9R2U|5|These are worth every penny. I have had the same ones on for over 2 years and still function like brand new! I can almost drive in the rain with out even turning them on they work so well at leaving a coating on the window.    These are WAAAAY better than any OEM ones you can ever get and don't even bother with the Rain X or other ones. Trust me, these wont do you wrong!
B00CFCHSS8|5|Inexpensive compared to dealer prices and fit just fine in a 2007 Honda Civic Hybrid.
B008VL67BG|5|Great bulb and great price. Bought online elsewhere a few years ago for a much higher price.<br />Lasts a lot longer than the other brand I bought.
B000EI0FT4|3|I purchased this case for my Magellan Roadmate 2200 series GPS. And while the case does hold all of the components it is a little large and oversized. But heck I'm not complaining it gets the job done.
B001UGPEFY|5|A crank is a crank.  Works as expected.
B009XO73M2|4|this lanyard is awesome, its a lanyard so you know what your gonna get but it has two hooks which is convenient and the nice metal buckle. the only issue is the bmw logo is a sticker type thing and feels like it will come off not a big deal at all. definitely a good lanyard for any bmw owner
B004BTO3UY|5|good product - quick shipping
B007O5GWNI|5|This brake controller is awesome. I especially appreciate the self diagnostics to let me know if there is an issue. Also,  the soft case and four memory settings make it great for all of my vehicles.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works better than a bolt, and can't be easily removed.
B0042I4W9G|5|I loved my sticker. I have yet to find where to place it but I was very content with my product.
B008BTLIYY|5|works great...plenty of cranking power even when having other starting problems it STILL hung in there until I resolved issues and cranked right up...
B00PDMKXA2|5|So much added torque with the added extension.  Makes lug nut removal a breeze.
B002FY23CC|5|I recently bought a head light from you guys for my 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 pick-up, my truck had been sitting for some time and it was my dads and he sort of handed it down to me i really enjoyed the pricing for this headlight because i looked in other places and the charge almost a hundred dollars for this little part thats so important but i got the package in the mail via FedEX and i was happy with being able to track my purchase and it came in a fast reasonable time thank you so much and i like the assembly it was a no brainer and the free light bulb was sweet because the the old assemlby had a puddle of water that i didnt know about so i wasted a bulb i bought before but now my truck is complete and sort of like new in a way[[ASIN:B002FY23CC 1994-2001 DODGE RAM HEADLIGHT RAM 94-01 COMBO HEADLAMP ASSEMBLY LEFT HAND, DRIVER SIDE]]
B00EKS5I96|5|Worked great, will purchase other items from them for my car (a spyder) if needed.
B009FOGP4C|1|It was defective.
B00GU8X1D4|5|LOVE IT.
B001R20JG0|4|I love this keychain, all the boys know Iam a jdm car fanatic. I just wanted to show off a little more with this keychain on my keys. Material is okay, still lasting to this day. Deosnt break easily. Is recommended this to anyone that loves JDM.
B0094FYSBO|5|slight color variation between pieces-which is Unusual for anodized parts-Good value compared to auto parts store
B006XYB1VE|5|Got these for front seats and they fit like a glove.  The length is just right and both ends snap into place with ease.
B0031GRUCG|4|liked the price. showed up on time. it works the way it should. it even helped with the gas mpg..
B00AEJDASQ|5|Fast shipping and perfect fit.
B004KT5VMY|5|I have had numerous comments on this item.  I like the way it looks and the way it fits.  Everything about this hitch cover works for me.
B000IXPQ3A|4|Shipped fast, and she loves it.  Would recommend seller to a friend..  It was nice that this was grouped with the blanket I decided to buy as a late Christmas gift.
B000G76PLA|5|These are solid bungee cords. They are strong and sturdy. They worked perfect when we had to setup our canopies during our track meets. We also use them to tie down things together like poles and stands. Good product for the cost of $10.15. Thank you.
B00144BIC0|5|I bought this product for two reasons. First being that I wanted a light on my tailgate to give the drivers behind me more information on my turning, braking etc. Second was to give my truck and aesthetic bonus. Needless to say I have gotten both. I was a bit worried that the bar wouldn't hold up but a few months in and it still shines bright with no reason to believe otherwise. The installation of the product was really easy and straight forward on my F150. The light bar was also shipped in a great tube package as it came in mint condition. I would suggest the seller, product, etc to anyone looking.
B0009U7Y2I|5|Very good car wash solution. It's more like a gel consistency and one doesn't need very much at all. This will last me for a very long time. It has a pleasant smell and does the job. No need to buy anything more expensive.
B001BW6AXC|5|I mounted these on the front of my Lund Impact one on each side from the casting deck to the gunnel. They are great to store Plano boxes while fishing.
B00A7D0J1A|5|These brake shoes were a direct fit and very easy to install.  Once I figured out the installation the job went quick and easy...
B000C7WVOE|5|This product is NOT an ignition coil, just a housing or cover for the coils.  I had to buy the 2 coils separately for an extra $35 ea. Should be labeled \\"coil housing/cover\\"
B0026M9DZS|4|Great fit.  Just make sure you have the hump pointed down during install.  Bushings are so-so.  We'll see how they last.
B00CEX3WQA|3|About what I expected.
B000E5WAD6|5|Best brand in air filters
B0002MBVAO|3|The mats are of good quality and seem to be well made. However, the fit is far from custom and not particularly good for Lincoln Town Car and they don't lend themselves to trimming. Other mats are as well made and fit as well or better for the price. Not a good value.
B0002GXOPK|5|Very nice set of lamps. Nice addition to my truck at a great price.
B00ASCNVPG|5|Good stuff - keep it up
B00FMITO2K|5|Great light. Great price
B007ZGKKMA|4|My husband had purchased another set of these for his tractor so it was a no-brainer to get this set for his duck boat. They don't draw much juice and throw the light an amazing distance. They're lightweight and the brackets are easily adjustable. They are pretty inexpensive too. Don't know what more you could ask for!
B00KHVFCHI|5|Biggest difference with these at 110K mi was a slightly faster & smoother idle. Didn't notice any MPG change. The old plugs were evenly worn and clean.
B000C16XMQ|4|the shipping time was better then I thought. The unit was packaged well and was compleat. Installation was easy and every bolt hole matched up just right. No fighting with the regulator at all. When I was done with the install, I hit the switch and my window was working again!!! Im happy with the product as of now. Only time will tell if I have any problems down the road. Price is right, quality seems very good and fit like a champ.
B000CSSR9G|5|Fits perfect and very durable.
B00MB0CTBU|3|This is one of those high/low reviews.  I liked the LED work light, having a light on the inflator is simply brilliant.  No trying to hold a flashlight and a tire inflator at the same time.<br /><br />I liked the storage for the accessories.  I was not impressed with the air pressure gauge.  I compared it to a digital tire gauge and an old fashion mechanical tire gauge.  I would run the tire pressure up to 40psi and as soon as I released the input button the pressure dropped to 30psi.  I had to hold it consistently on 40psi to get it up to 35psi.<br /><br />It is compact which is nice.  The optional 4&#34; air hose isn't really an option.  I was not able to use their suggested method of air input which does not include the 4&#34; hose.  The valves on my tires were not nearly long enough to use their &#34;no hose&#34; method.<br /><br />I guess for the money this is ok.
B0049J3SK2|5|Anyone who complains about the assembly has zero business even driving a vehicle, let alone with something attached to the rear of it. It took 20 mins by myself and the carrier is well designed and well made. A+
B00ZVJ2YFY|5|I needed to cover my worn seats and these were just what I needed.  They were easy to install and since my back bench comes off, I was able to get it covered in no time.  My Ford Windstar seat covers are looking old and worn so when I added these covers on, it made it feel as if we got new seats, though you still feel the worn cushion when sitting on it.  There is a smell to the covers but it is not offensive or strong to me.  It actually made my van smell kind of new again.  I was weary since I had read many of the reviews and problems with fittings but in my Ford Windstar, there were no problems and it accented the interior.  Best to make sure with company that these covers will fit your particular type of vehicle before ordering.<br /><br />I received my product at a discount in return for my unbiased and honest review.
B007TG7HV8|5|Found the Bosch wipers to be very good for year round use but beings that I replace my wipers each year heading into the cold Winter months I don't know how well they would last past 12 months of service. I'm sticking with this brand, they're very good.
B001UJXPNO|5|After taking quite some time on the covercraft site, I finally found the product ID to order this product.  Covercraft website says this will fit my 2011 Ford FX4 Crew Cab.  Amazon says it wont.    Rest assured, this fit on my truck perfect.  Its too bad the graphic for this cover shows a car and not a truck.  If you are looking for a CAB cover for a Crew size, this will fit as far as I can tell 2004 - 2011 model year ford trucks.    The seller was fine.  I called after amazon told me it was shipped and asked for a UPS tracking number.  They obliged and sent it to me rather quickly.    I didnt want to spend big $$ on a cover. I just wanted one to keep the CAB cool, stop bird poop, pollen...etc from getting on the cab.  This cover is water resistant, not water proof.  Not a big deal. it gets wet, then it dries...      Great product.
B00LFCYN2I|5|Great product fast shipping thanks so much
B005NLQAHS|5|Works as advertised...easy to setup and the detailed real-time information is exceptional.  For the price you won't find a better scan tool.
B002R8HMAY|5|Parts all fit well, they all looked very much like the original OEM parts, belt had alignment marks and directions were included.  I recommend this kit.
B006B28RX8|5|Looks great but have yet to install them.  Once they are installed I will update.
B003LTEC0G|4|easy, easy, easy,
B009X51E76|4|These are nice snow goggles.  I bought them because I walk in the winter time, and when it is cold and the wind is blowing I like to wear glasses.  These allow me to keep a scarf over my face without fogging up the lenses.  They seem well made, and the price was great.  They fit me well too.
B002HK2892|1|Naver received
B001U04MYE|5|I highly recommend this inverter. I have used numerous inverters and I can say without a doubt, this is the most compact and quietest one I have come across. Construction is very good and I really like the fact that it cuts out if the car battery gets too low. The USB port is very handly for charging my iPods, iPhone, and GPS. Must have for travelling!
B00B93ZXGS|5|great product
B00192KZQ2|5|Just the perfect addition to a drain outlet that an RV manufacturer left too short and under a slide
B00AF6JPDC|5|Now that I've used this particular bag 5 days a week for the past 4 months, I feel like I can give an honest review. Please forgive me though, this is going to be a long one. I'm in the military and, for most of us, that means showing up for accountability early in the morning and conducting some sort of daily physical training (PT). I live about 20 minutes from where I work by highway (or \\"Autobahn\\"), so it is very inconvenient and a huge waste of time and money for me to drive to PT formation, then back to my barracks for personal hygiene, then back again to report for duty. Therefore, I use this bag to transport everything I need for the day and just shower at the post gym.<br /><br />Design: I think it looks pretty cool. It has a more intricate design than many other bags of this type, but honestly it's nothing too special. It is just a gym bag after all. Most of the design elements fall into functionality anyway, which I will get into later. This particular style that I bought is the black/silver version. The outer bag itself is made out of what appears to be nylon fabric with a shiny diamond cross-hatch pattern sewn in. Also, the silver parts are kind of reflective (but not like the PT belt *wink*). The inside liner is a another type of nylon fabric that is light grey with a faint \\"OGIO\\" logo pattern printed all over it.<br /><br />Functionality: Here's where we get into the details. This is a very functional duffel bag for all types of activities, even when not used exactly as intended. Let me break it down. This bag has 7 main outer zipper (excuse me, \\"slide fastener\\") compartments. On the back is a flap that, when unzipped, reveals a spandex fabric which all together functions as a bottle holder (1). The sides without the spandex have a shiny insulating liner. The large side compartments are essentially extensions of the main compartment, but have a loose liner that separates them from it. The left side (2) is labelled for footwear and the unlabelled right(3) is for....other stuff. The right compartment also has a sizeable crush-resistant container (4) jutting inside. The left also has two plastic reinforced holes near the bottom, which are probably there to allow loose dirt to fall out or soggy shoes to dry. The front compartment (5) is labelled for \\"nutrition organization\\" and contains several small mesh pockets sewn into the liner. It also has a zippered pocket inside the flap that runs its entire length. The bottom compartment (6) is very unique and is for storage of wet or soiled clothing. It has an additional zipper that allows for 2 inches of vertical expansion that reveals 4 mesh walls for rapid drying. This compartment is also lined with a waterproof insulator like the bottle holder. Then, there is the main compartment (7), which is fairly large when nothing is placed in the side compartments. The top flap also has a loose internal spandex pocket that is labelled for, and expands to fit, a helmet. Each of these outer compartments' flaps unzip on three sides so they can be opened completely.<br /><br />Usability: Like I said, I use this bag to carry my uniform and hygiene products after a morning of good PT, so I don't really use it exactly as intended, but it works very well for me. The footwear compartment is large enough to fit my boots. The front compartment is large enough to hold almost all of my hygiene products (e.g. shampoo, lotion, shaving kit, body wash, etc) and the right side is where I put my shower shoes. The crush-resistant container is where I put all my loose items that I don't bring to PT (e.g. phone, wallet, keys, pens, etc). I keep the bottom compartment expanded because that's where I put my wet towel and rag after I shower, along with my PT uniform if it gets too soiled. The main compartment is where I put the rest of my work uniform and my towel before I shower. Because my boots extend into the main compartment (separated by a liner), I have to put my uniform in first, then kind of slide the toes of my boots over top. Lastly, I put my dental hygiene kit in the helmet pocket and I slide a water bottle into the bottle holder. With this configuration, the duffel bag is almost completely filled out. Aren't I lucky? The bag can be carried two ways, as is customary. One way is to use the two hand carry straps that can be velcroed (sorry again, \\"hook and pile taped\\") together by a soft foam flap. The other way is to use the adjustable shoulder strap with a thin foam pad sewn into the middle. Both types of carries are comfortable due to the foam. None of these straps are removable.<br /><br />Durability: I feel as if this is a bag made to last. The diamond cross-hatch pattern that I mentioned earlier is for reinforcement of the fabric, which reminds me of the rip-stop fabric used in my ACUs, although I believe this works better. All of the outer zippers are made with thick, solid plastic that almost never snags, and then only if the loose liners are peeking out, which is easy to remedy. I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I can quickly tell if a zipper is quality or not and these are quality. The light grey liner isn't as tightly woven or reinforced like the outer shell (probably to let more air through), but it seems just as durable nonetheless. I haven't experienced any tears internally or externally with this bag, especially the footwear compartment where dirt and rocks from my boots grind into the liner, or the outside bottom which is covered with a tough rubbery fabric shell. Besides the bottom, the outer shell isn't exactly waterproof, but it does offer some sort of resistance due to the tightly woven fabric. Water, for the most part, will roll right off the bag or can be shaken off before it's slowly absorbed. So, I wouldn't worry too much about spills or carrying it in the rain. I never feel like the straps are going to break, then again I don't put too much weight into the bag, and we all know that s*** happens sometimes.<br /><br />Overall, this is the perfect duffel bag for my purposes, as explained. I do, however, also plan on using it as a carry-on when I travel on planes and for outdoor recreational activities during the warmer months. It is not too flashy so you can take this into work or travel with it, but I do believe that not many people have this bag, so it's still quite unique. The only thing that I wish is for this bag to be able to stand up on it's own, although it does have some rigidity built into the front and side compartment flaps. This type of build may be kind of an advantage in that you can roll or fold this bag up pretty tightly when not using it, so it's up to you.
B002Y2NYUK|5|Awesome product, Awesome savings
B0013RGQW0|5|Love them on my husbands Jeep!
B0092P0MBQ|4|Ordered this for my 2013 Chrysler 200 LTD-S and found the front window deflectors fit perfectly. I also found this manufacturer had best reviews when I searched for this product. My only displeasure, and very minor, is that the rear window deflectors do not extend over the fixed wing window for more of an appealing cosmetic look and fit.
B003WM9RZW|5|Best stuff you will ever find for your RV.
B002TN4NRW|5|Excellent!!!!!!!
B005345ELS|2|materiel wise its fine, but I dont like the way the back of it is done. Wish it had a big/wide tail in the middle of it that also hanged down. If not, Id use it...
B004YTMZOC|5|Perfect size for the back window of my new car. Not too flashy.
B00495UQT2|5|used it for my old dodge pickup to replace the one that was frozen and broke  actually I used two  the dodge is what I ordered it for  but decided it would fit in the cab of my Kubota tractor  driving around for snow removal on a wet salty sloppy day  the cab windows get too dirty to see  worked fantastic  thanks
B009W4QPN6|5|will let you know
B000HB27K8|5|Works perfectly but needs a hard wedge to get the door jam ajar slightly so wedge can be inserted properly
B001C9D4H4|5|This item worked as advertised and was half the price that i found in local automotive stores.  I will purchase again if the need arises.
B00Q8CF7DE|5|Great
B0077FGXJ8|1|I ordered a left powered folding mirror but received a right non powered mirror. Truly annoyed.
B0078MJKI6|3|Very expensive.  It took 4 containers to cover a Carhartt size XL hooded action jacket.  That amounted to over $40.00.  One trip to the cleaners and it will need to be done again.  The wax does do a good job of making jacket water repellant.
B001V8U12M|5|Works great with my drill to secure the jacks under my trailer and level up my trailer using the jacks I also purchased on Amazon
B002JBCLHS|5|Excellent replacements. They have now been in my truck for a few months, and cant tell them from oem quality. Fit is perfect, and no moisture inside the light fixtures like most aftermarket fixtures. For the money, you will not be disappointed at all.
B000V8QVX6|4|Seems to work well enough so far, but is just warm, not really warm, and doesn't have heat to the edges.  If it was really cold in the car, this would probably not be enough, and the fact that the outside 8 inches or so is not heated is a negative.  It works well enough for what I paid for it.  It is not machine washable.
B00A8MZ7IA|4|Nice
B004RI7946|5|Optimum has, since its start provided some of the very best car care products I've seen on the market.  My Ranger has a LOT of exterior vinyl and Optimum Car Wax (OCW) leaves a beautiful shine on it as well as the paint.  It is certainly marvelous that I don't have to carefully edge around the vinyl when applying this wax.  I also like that this wax provides full spectrum UV protection.<br /><br />I can wipe down my Ranger in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />I don't use OCW as a LSP (last stage protection) but rather have three coats of Finish Kare 1000P sealant followed by another three coats of Finish Kare 4625 wax to provide the depth I like.  The Optimum Car wax serves as a sacrificial coating that I replace monthly.  I'm too much of a car nut to go a full five months between applications that the company says is possible..<br /><br />I have heard some people complain of streaking but I've never had this problem.  Applying this wax is pretty straightforward.  I spritz a small amount of wax on the surface from about a foot away.allowing the wax to hit the surface as a very fine mist and then wipe it down with a good microfiber cloth that I've made sure is clean.  I also make sure the surface is clean because if there is some grime on the surface, then you will very likely have streaks.<br /><br />Bottom line:  OCW has become a key part of my exterior maintenance program.
B0030CI6HY|1|I believe TYC might have the specs wrong on this one...I ended up getting a replacement after the first one didn't fit. But the replacement did NOT fit as well. Motor and regulator works well uninstalled; but once you actually screw it in on the door, the alignment is off. I ended up returning both. My car is a 2004 Highlander. Price is a value vs. OEM - i just wish they didn't have fit/alignment issues. I ended up buying one at 1A Auto, but even their non-OEM product had similar issues with fit/alignment. I finally just took out the motor from the new regulator and installed it on my old regulator. Looking back now, I would have just grabbed the motor from this and installed it on my mine instead of getting my hopes up of getting a non-OEM regulator w/motor that fits directly. That would've saved me some labor hours.
B009DJRYF8|5|These fenders are a very good replacement! I was surprised how close this fender was stamped compared to my original! I saw no difference in any aspect of design! It also had the studs like the originals. Put the fender on my truck,  everything lined up perfectly. Can't wait to order the other fender and hood! Price was very nice and it was double boxed for shipping and it arrived 5days earlier than expected. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good replacement.
B004UVL9QE|5|Worked great for my 2001 Ford F150 5.4L V-8 Supercrew.
B0084UK7CE|5|Great product
B0006FLNB4|5|After looking for a couple of weeks, I decided to get a pair of these for a very reasonable price under fufty bucks. They slid onto my '01 B2500 Dodge van mirrors with just a little effort. I screwed on the retaining nut. It was tough to tell if the retaining nut was on tight enough, but a little trial and error got it just right. I drove the freeway with these on and was glad that my original mirrors were unobstructed and the new secondary mirrors were as stable in the wind as necessary to be able to see traffic behind me. Additionally they look like they belonged as OEM equipment. Very happy with them and would highly recommend. Just be sure that you slide them over the OEM mirrors correctly and tighten the supplied knob sufficiently. Probably not as good as the strap-on mirrors that I also almost bought, but as I said, these mirrors look and act like they came with the van and are much cheaper.<br />Photos here...<br />[...]
B00JH1HI94|5|Looks great on my black cragar rims
B001H1O688|5|Perfect and protects the gas opening, what else could you want?
B003NS5NK8|3|To much work they maguires and nu finish have scratch removes that do the same thing in a quarter oft he time
B00NCL8BMS|5|I love
B0002UEMZ2|5|As advertised
B00BWEEQ8A|5|HaHa I had a good time with someone over this. Really cool. They arrived before I thought they would. Pretty professional enough, Good item to start a conversation
B000BWCG3G|4|Very happy with this 1&#34; spacer all in all. Fit and finish is good, price is reasonable, and comes with the necessary hardware and gaskets. The only minor thing to be aware of is that the sides and back are undercut on the outside to save weight and material. This is not clearly shown in the pictures. This is not a problem unless you want to very seriously clearance or 'port match' it to your manifold. If you clearance the inside opening aggressively you can end up through the thin side walls. I believe this to be a RARE problem but worth mentioning since it kind of surprised me. Most spacers are a solid casting that's cut to the inner and outer profiles. (Top down view) My Holley 750DP fit on the spacer and then on my Stealth manifold with no binding or range of motion issues right out of the package. The openings all lined up perfectly so no special clearance adjustments were required. I believe for probably 99 out of 100 people this spacer will work perfectly right out of the pack and never be an issue. Definitely worth buying if you need an economical true 1&#34; spacer.
B001LHXTO0|5|I am a Service Technician at A Acura dealer.  This tool has performed as advertised on a number of makes and models. Including high end models.  I have been impressed with its speed ease of use and accuracy. I'd recommend this tool to eney one who needs a fast symple to use scan tool for home or shop use.
B001O7PNS2|5|We LOVE Meguiar's, The BEST Automotive Detailing Products Available Anywhere !!!!!!
B000E3EWNE|4|Works very  well.  Durable an soft on the hand
B004IAB4DK|5|I had just a little trouble getting them to slide together, but when I did, they were nice and tight. I can't see the lines between them so they look great. The only problem I see is that it might be hard to remove the individual switches. The housing covers the tabs for release
B00FM7B1AO|5|The Bosch EV charging station was relatively easy for my electrician to install.  It is attractive and unobtrusive.  It feels well made of sturdy materials.  It has worked flawlessly so far.
B00K3US66W|5|Great shifter with a unbeatable price.
B00KK45XJO|5|I LOVE this sticker.  It incorporates all of my Boston teams into one logo.  I don't have to have a ton of stickers junking up my car window.<br />And the shipping is free. What more could you ask for.
B0049UNTNM|4|Added these to my 2012 Silverado Crew Cab and LOVE the look it gives it.  They were easy to install the one tip I would give is to leave all hardware amply loose till you have everything dry fit then tighten. Doing this will make the install go very very easy. I had them both on the truck in less than a hour.
B009UGWT8G|5|Very nice little keychain for the motorcycle lover...even more perfect for the Indian motorcycle lover.....It comes with a little note explaining its purpose in a black velvet bag. I really like it and the idea of it(for luck) however it was much smaller then I expected.
B000BZEPXW|5|It was a great experience to do it myself. Actually this is what works for me. A mechanic would have charged me millions just to change this lock. I did it myself.
B000F3RYGA|3|It's OK, Just not as tight as I would have Liked!!
B00M7CGNGO|1|did not line up
B00080QHMM|3|This thing works fast. Way easier than the old tire gauges I've been using all my life. The rubber handle is pretty nice. It's also lightweight.<br /><br />On the con side, it could have been made a bit smaller. It's a little awkward, and although it works well for cars, it does not for bicycles as I have to weave it into the spokes just so. Even then, it's difficult to keep it from releasing a lot of air from the tire in an attempt to get a reading.
B000CIZZZ0|5|fit was perfect . looks great , would definitly purchase another if i had to.over all a great product for your money
B0074BRBYG|4|Perfect fit east to install with a little wiring know how would have been five had the instructions been more detailed
B000BGOFL8|5|So, there we are in our 36' Class A motor home five hundred miles away from home and the \\"coach to the tow car break light cord\\" breaks. We can't drive home with out a new cord but there is no place in the remote area we are camping to get one. I Goggled the Blue Ox 6 Wire Coiled Electrical Cable but found nothing suitable. My wife said, \\"Why don't you check out Amazon?\\"  \\"Amazon\\", I said. \\"Don't they sell books and spices?\\"<br /><br />I checked and was amazed that Amazon did indeed carry this unusual specialty cord. But, could it be delivered in time for our scheduled departure from the RV Camp? I crossed my fingers while typing the on line order and asked for a one day delivery. \\"No way they can get this cord to us way out here in the boonies in one day.\\" I thought. \\"No, way!\\"<br /><br />Boy was I wrong! The next day the package arrived! The word \\"flummoxed\\" came to mind. How in the world did you do that?<br /><br />I will never doubt Amazon again. You guys are simply amazing - or should I say you are simply Amazon!
B00114NVU0|5|great
B000CPCBMI|5|Easy install, hides well, good clearance compared to newer Siennas.
B000C2AP88|5|Great product
B000IG5PVU|5|I always put deer warning bell on my truck. I don't know if they work or I'm just lucky----but they don't work for bear--I hit a bear last month :(
B002P48O2U|4|Bought a pair as a gift.  They love the chairs.... Much more comfortable than the standard folding chair.  The folding features allows storage during winter season.
B001QVRSWK|2|Expected item to be more sturdy, eapecially on the bottom; instead it seems flimsy.  Bought multiple Organizers for Christmas gifts, however, when they arrived they were not individually boxed!
B00J0KTK0M|3|You have to cut them to fit your car.
B0022ZOH9G|5|Bought this to get rid of the stock \\"dumbo's\\" on my V-Star with 18\\" apes.  Mounted up easily, and blends perfectly.  Just what I wanted to clean up the look, and still have fair visibility out the back.  A little locktite, and it's been in place for months with no issues.  Great quality mirror!
B00B4EQ6LS|5|Protects the charger as promised and provides anti-slip and cushioning stability.  Can set the charger on a car's fender or on any smooth surface and the charger does not slip off.
B000E6OKHO|5|The the 289 V-8 Ford starter was delivered in good condition and in it's original box, the Starter looks to be New or remanufactured, the box was not deaged in any way, and the delivery person was very nice to me at the day of delivery. so I would give this product a 100% and I would be glad to buy again from this person or Company
B0064ONM1A|5|A birthday present for my princess, love it!! Still looks like new 6 months later after snow and lots of rain.,
B0012KGXKI|5|picking up the whole set. adding them splayed across a gun case. sweet!
B001URKV0G|5|Used this to treat my motorcycle helmet. Worked perfectly. My Cheapt helmet is DOT approved but sounded like a wind turbine. Sprayed the styrofoam interior and it is now as quiet as a much more expensive brand. I picked this product because it is not asphalt based so doesn't stink or have fumes once cured.
B000C2E3EK|5|If you're sleeving a small block Chevrolet harmonic balancer, I highly recommend using this!
B00480J4J6|5|As described. saved us a lot of money
B0068FUWGI|5|Nice balancer and wheel truing feature is a plus.
B001CI54ZU|2|the exhaust does not fit my 73 mgb gt either. Had to bend the pipe it then worked however could not get the exhaust to come out from under the car straight.
B00EDQQHZY|5|Perfect match for factory original on my 2010 F150. No install issues, took about 25 minutes.
B000CPIN34|5|I read a few other reviews before I bought it and was sceptical.I found a few light coats were much better than heavy one as this stuff is very thin.If you take your time and do it right it makes an absolutely perfect finish.It looks very professional,great product.It also helps to heat what you are going to paint cures a lot faster.I also painted cars and boats for 25 years so I do know what I'm talking about.
B00IBZMUO0|5|I received this sooner than expected. I like that not only does it move up and down but sideways also.
B0002MBKUK|4|A bit smaller than 31 inches.
B00S92Q8E8|5|Just as pictured and works great. Very soft and lightweight material. Worked perfect under our snowmobile helmets.
B000ETQMIQ|2|T o small unless you like restaking  your garbage to make room. I can make enough garbage going around the block to fill this. lol
B0009YDQEO|5|Great value for these quality car mats!  Quick shipping.  Recommended!
B00BMJ8Q0O|4|I have the crinkle black version and it looks great. Almost has a stock look to it to the undiscerning eye. The only thing giving it away is the bright red on the side of the intake tube. Very straight forward install, just be careful of the lower screw on the filter housing, as it could fall and get caught on top of one of the plastic skid plates. Ask me how I know. Only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the fit of the intake tube to the filter housing, there isn't any. There is a gap all the way around the intake tube and the rubber grommet you put in the housing. Maybe that is by design to prevent a possible ground path of the maf sensor, so it could be by design. That is my only gripe about the intake system.
B0073WEZU4|5|I picked this antenna for the quality that others talked about, it definitely has that. No more floppy antenna, radio reception is horrible but ok if you are in the city. I use pandora/Sirius anyways these days.
B0056JC02Q|2|My husband had me order these.  He will be giving them to our sons.  I have never seen these decals displayed on the window of a car or vehicle on the road.  Yet the decals arrived on a piece of paper with simple directions r/t how to apply them.  It's a cute gag gift, yet I'm definitely not putting it on my vehicle.  I liken it to the WILD WEST when gunslingers put notches on their gun for each kill.
B006FYGPAE|1|Because I onley needed the case the yellow part so I cause replace the blade in it the blade is good
B00SV54LBK|1|Installation brackets DO NOT work!! The two upper attachment screws and nuts interfere with the upper core support on the Jeep. The only way to attach this guard is to discard the brackets and install the guard using zip ties with adhesive mounts, but this method may not hold up very long. I'm very unhappy with this product.
B000C5HYV6|4|No problems.
B001HNWXLS|5|I bought these for my husband for his Jeep Wrangler. They are heavy and of great quality. He had to trim to fit but he just loves them. Very pleased.
B000P23HZS|5|received in good working condition. very good value for the money. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good piece of equipment for full time use or just a spare.
B00OXQY1NY|5|Perfect tank bag for a Honda Rebel. Exactly fits the tank and can hold just enough essentials, wristlet, keys, glasses, cell phone (too big for the outside pocket) and a notebook. There are also interior pockets that are useful for change and hair bands. The outside pockets for cell phones and nav systems are too small (at least for mine) but great for other items you want to keep handy, like sunglasses or gum. The included strap converts the bag to a small sling backpack, pretty convenient. The magnets hold tight and the bag doesn't slip around at all. The quality is great, I would recommend this tank bag to any rider.
B000I14RY6|5|it is very high quality and useful tool and surely i recommend it for those who seek professional and quality work.
B00C5TFOQO|5|Look great on my jeep wrangler!
B0068G164E|5|Came a day early and in great packaging. Couldnt be happier. Thanks
B00W3JY5O8|5|Perfect! Turn signals and brake light all in one! Doesn't take up space stuck right above license on back!
B00K0VMXDQ|1|I had to return my Brighton product, the flash light stated on the entire time I had it. It's a shame because I liked it; it had everything I needed. The car battery charger was small enough. Looking for another charger...
B00541775Q|5|We have a 2011 Honda Pilot and it fits perfectly. We have a dog with lots of little shedding hairs so this helps me keep my sanity!
B0006Z9SRA|5|Good product. Speedy delivery. Boyfriend was excited to use them.
B000EH4V0Y|1|LEAKS!  I filled it up with water and it leaks badly, coming up through the black cap.  I would not believe the positive reviews or perhaps their quality is down, but this is useless.  I recommend you not buy it!
B001EJU1BY|5|This compressor is really fast.  It is much better than the original compressor that was installed for the air ride on my truck.
B0041FC616|5|Will buy these for every car I own from now on. They are amazing- custom fit, washes off, sporty look that lasts years, holds water, spills and messes away from carpet!
B007EEVKS6|1|It is the worst carb ever nothing matches up choke lever hits frame on dirt bike you get what you pay for its junk
B008U1MOM8|5|Works great on my gt86 .. Shipping came early..
B00AKWAODQ|5|is good
B0081OSRT8|5|Did its job as advertised. Will buy more.
B002AKFA94|3|I would like to give this product 5 *'s but the fact that my LED lights do not come on when bumped made me drop it down by 2 *'s. I thought maybe it was the batteries so I installed a fresh set of LR44/AG13 batteries but the LED still did not light up when bumped. The LED did turn on when my magnetic screwdriver touched the screws as I was putting back the battery cover but when bumped it does not. I really wish the LED lights would work and turn on but until I figure out what it wrong with it I'll just use it without the LED lights.<br /><br />** ADDITIONAL TIP TO ALL THE REVIEWERS WHO WROTE ABOUT ISSUES WITH IT TIPPING OVER : Go to your local sports supply store like a Sports Chalet, Big5, or even Target and Walmart buy a small 5 lbs. weight with a hole in the center meant for a dumbbell bar ... place the weight down gently then put the LED Parking Signal spring pole through the center of the weight and it should solve your tipping over issues. Another option is to change the base to something heavier such as a a heavy wood block just drill a hole about the size of the spring pole and it should keep it steady.
B000C846NW|1|the cap fits the gas tank on my 2003 saturn vue; however it does not lock, defeats the purpose.
B00LM6O91M|3|Pain in the butt to install!!!
B000V526FQ|5|I had forgotten how good this car used to ride. Installation was not as easy as I had seen on Youtube mostly due to inability to remove the old struts. Had to replace the worn out ball joints as well and take to a shop for wheel alignment. After that the ride is so good I am not thinking of trading the car in the near future any more.
B0012RGAN6|1|died within 6 months, but this was the middle of winter so i didn't want to bother with pulling it for warranty service.  all towing was with relatively new u-haul small/open trailers with maintained/checked wiring.  the unit probably saw 4 hours of live service, and i never even launched a boat with it.<br /><br />have ordered the curt 56019, aka CURT C56019 - will gamble on this model to see if it lasts<br /><br />luckily, a big part of the install was *securely* routing the long wire under the frame from the back tail light to the engine bay, so if this wire tests out good and can be re-used the second install should take half the time.<br /><br />manufacturers: please give us at least two summers out of your products, it's not really that much to ask.
B00ET5W4W4|4|It proved to be a greater convenience than I originally thought and saved me many unnecessary steps and fumbling with too many keys and so was an instant hit. It was easy to implement and I was delighted that it did what it claimed to do exactly as it was claimed that it would. I use it to lock the storage box in the bed of my truck.
B005H12QXG|5|Exactly as advertised! Fit is perfect! Following the instructions was simple and easy, allowing for a flawless and quick install! Now all my Silverado owning neighbors want some !!
B0024EC170|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Nothing fancy but it works. Great product. Would buy again if I needed one.
B003QI0G34|4|Excellent tool, don't go out and buy the cheaper one, because this won't bend and slip and start to sheer off your fan clutch nut.
B00192JF9U|4|Works great to cover what I wanted to cover. Doesn't budge while driving.
B004XDX6VA|4|I've had one of these for several years with no problems. Inflates my RV tires just fine. But I'm counting off one star since it isn't fast. Gets the job done even on high pressure RV tires, but be patient.
B001CXT7BM|4|First, the seller: the helmet was boxed without padding, and the delivery man tossed it over the fence onto the concrete. Upon opening the box, I found micro-cracks around the visor attachment. Thinking my poor helmet was now flawed, I took pictures and e-mailed the seller. Without question, I was sent a new helmet. Apparently, the micro-cracks are actually typical for that area on the helmet and aren't really cracks at all (or so my friends tell me). Anyway, 5 stars to the seller for questioning my lack of helmet knowledge. Second, the helmet: both the visor and the face mask can be popped up, which is wonderful, and the air vents keep my face cool. The padding inside the helmet is very comfortable. My only complaint, if you can call it so, is the strap- I can't get it tight enough, so the helmet bobbles a bit on my head. Maybe I could go a size down, but I doubt it. All in all, a wonderful buy, and people are often jealous of my air vents and movable face mask.
B00803O6PE|5|Bought this cheaper than my wholesale price as a dealer!
B007VR9BS2|5|Works great.  Exactly what I was looking for.
B007GRGWDY|5|I placed on 2012 Road Glide. Now it rides like my 2003 FatBoy .. It is a smooth ride and not a hard ride like the factory air shocks.. GREAT  purchase.. They are a easy install as well
B004VROJ32|4|The Go Cruise works great. It gives my hand some relief on long rides. It's nice to be able to set it and shake out my hand. It needs a little tweak now and then to keep the speed up, but it's not a big deal. For about $20, you can't go wrong.
B00DSJAEGU|5|I'm very happy with this purchase. The water quality from my RO is great.  I would buy these again when I need to change the filters.
B00R8HBD86|4|A little too long unless you bhave a reasonably thick license plate frame. However, they work unlike the ridiculous short 'Genuine BMW' ones which do not reach the threads.
B0002NYC0O|5|The regular Lisle bits are really only good for a few uses, but this one seems to be holding up well.
B00449AC9C|5|Prompt shipment of quality product.
B005F9BCB2|5|Works as advertised
B00EZAA9RK|1|Not of good quality, returned.
B0045LA0MI|1|This set does not fit 83 xr 500 as the ad states. Package clearly marked x 500 79 thru 81. Set us a big rip off.  Seller Mismatched ad and failed to check a fir prior to shipment.  Therfore parts I received were just a waste of time.
B00HS5ZU64|5|Smells good and makes his car smell better.
B0035P7KCI|4|Used this on some dents from some pretty big hail,  at first it didn't really work, but then instead of just screwing the puller up until it popped off, I kind of pulled it some, then unscrewed it, then pulled it, then unscrewed it, many cycles of this (almost like massaging the dent out) and after many attempts it actually made the large dents look like small dings, although I was not able to completely remove a dent to where it isn't noticeable.  It turns a dent visible from 20 feet away to a dent visible from 5 feet away.  In that regard, $15 or less is pretty good deal, but if you want your dings totally fixed, I don't think this is the tool.  Comes with 3 glue sticks, I went through one stick per two dents because I had to keep doing it.
B001PNC5CW|1|Brought this water sensor wrench back in October 2013. I tried to use it today, 15 March 2014. It does not come close to fitting my 2013 Chevy 2500 HD Duramax water sensor. What a waste of my money. I just used some channel locks. They worked great.
B00BITHLBI|5|Received promptly. Arrived intact. Installed without instructions and they worked as needed. Well pleased.
B000FGI6E6|5|Oil filters are tough to get to on the newer Harleys.  The nut top on these are perfect.  Plus you get K&N quality inside the filter.
B003CJQRY4|5|Solved my 06 KTM 450 not wanting to start when hot problem.  Nice!
B000TYTR42|5|I was hesitant to buy this part online as I was not sure if this is going to fit my car.<br />But it is exactly like the one on my car. The thickness of the tank was good to hold the pressure coming from the coolant circulation. I have been using for the past one month and I haven't seen issues with this new tank.<br /><br />It's a good one. I recommend it.
B00I0YORDY|5|Just perfect! My key stopped working and i cut it open to change the battery.. (did not work by the way) but when i try putting it back together it looked horrible.. but with this, it looks like a brand new key, i absolutely loved it.
B00KTIVHLY|4|The items work fine, as the buttons do need to be pressed evenly level when initiating a function.  The instructions were difficult to follow and did not yield the desired outcome, so I went to the internet and found a website (not through the manufacturer) that explained a different protocol and it worked.
B001SLAJRY|4|This cover fit decently well over the bench seat in our 2004 Mercury Monterey.  We did have to do a little tweaking to get it smooth in some places, but it does a nice job now that we've gotten it in place.  We did have quite a bit of fabric down the back of the seat that had to be pinned up to keep it from coming loose.  It's soft and comfortable to sit on.
B0040CWY58|5|Worked great!
B00OZ12JIQ|4|Product is great. Welds are perfect, steel is top quality.  My issue was the sound of the xg1 was almost IDENTICAL to no muffler!! Made my nc700 sound just like the harley sportster I ride with. It did not sound like a sport touring bike it sounded like a harley with hallow pipes.
B00EC8XLXY|5|Seller shipped item very quickly. The nerf bars installed quickly, looked great, and worked well.
B007LICSEA|2|Did come with any hardware, but I was aware of this when I purchased.  Material is really thin and easily cracked.  I thought it would be sturdier as it looks in the photos.  Not as advertised:<br />Heavy-duty acrylic construction - NOT TRUE, AT BEST VERY light-duty ACRYLIC CONSTRUCTION.<br />• Recommended for off-road use - I WOULDN'T RECOMMED, MAY BLOCK SOME DUST AND INSECTS.<br />• Easy to install - YEA THEY GOT ONE RIGHT.<br />• Durable and long lasting - YET TO BE SEEN, NOT VERY DURABLE.  I ALMOST CRACKED IT WITH PLASTIC SCREWS INSTALLING.<br />• Gives your vehicle a great new look - QUESTIONALBE AS TO HOW GREAT.<br />I wouldn't by this product again, I'd seek a more durable/thicker material, especially if you reside in HOT climate and auto is exposed to UV rays, it'll break it down like a house of cards in a tornado.
B00D3RP0N4|5|Great
B000OIGTYE|5|Happy with this product
B000LQMYZC|5|Will never use nothing else in my Harley. Had these in my last bike and never had an issue. Also bought extras and installed in girlfriends Sportster. Both bike now run awesome. Now have over 5000 miles and they are still going strong.
B001L2E8MC|5|I've never put on hubcaps before, and these were super simple to put on and look great on my car to boot!
B000VKM4NK|5|A pair of hubs were much less then local auto parts store, like $100+. Hubs had Timken bearings and were stamped 'made in USA'. Came with new speed sensors/harness.  Quality looked good and install was no problem. We'll see how they last. Last set I got from NAPA (at much higher cost) went about 60K miles before I again had the 'ABS problem'. Cleaning sensors didn't work, new hubs fixed problem.
B009VYWIMO|3|I installed this unit on a 2005 Pacifica.  The installation was somewhat difficult.  It would have been more difficult had I not gone on line to get advice and direction from others who installed the system.  The image presented on the monitor is good; the camera itself was easy to adjust.  I have some trepidation as it has not rained on the car since I've installed the system.  I have read a few reviews where the reviewers said the camera is not waterproof as claimed by the mfr.  I'll find out eventually.  The only other negative is that the transmitter doesn't come with any kind of mounting bracket, so I would recommend a Velcro strip or something to stick it to a mounting spot.  The monitor mounting system is somewhat lacking as well.  On my Pacifica, the windshield is so far away from me, that if I mounted it on the windshield using the suction cup method, I wouldn't be able to see much.  I was able to mount it on the dash, using the suction cup hardware supplied.  However, I had to buy a weighted beanbag receptacle in which to place the monitor and  the system supplied suction cup bracket.  We'll see how it goes.  The jury is still out on this one.
B009RXS0TO|5|Keys work perfectly fine and completely fulfilled my needs and we're delivered in a very short time
B00F84INRK|5|Had to buy this one as my other one covered my expiration sticker , this one has the holes for all 4 bolts and open edges !
B002UC8UG2|5|This system was easily installed as per the included instructions.  Just be sure you but the correct unit for your vehicle.
B006A49KJC|5|use this in my mzr mazda that is a very dirty engine by design and very similar to some euro motors. the 40w keeps the engine quieter than the same oil in 5w30.
B00857CM8S|5|I've been seeing a lot of the &#34;I believe&#34; stickers around Colorado lately.  This one is a little bit more fun / original, and is going to look really good camping this summer!
B001C62BQC|5|These rotors along with some different pads (police version) totally fixed the brake shudder on my 2009 Impala when driving in the mountains.  This  car is problematic for this issue and this was part of a good solution.
B00625F8RW|5|Winch looks to be a good product. I will know more about it once it get it installed on my vehicle is a few weeks.
B003O75N30|4|Very handy
B003LF30CG|3|If you are a female with average size hands order the small size. The med gloves are way too big.
B003U1NPBW|5|I always thought that the stick families on the back of people's vehicles were cheesy but these skull family decals fit my family perfectly.  I had no problems putting them on my car and have had no issues with them coming off.  I would highly recommend them if you and your family are a little quirky and aren't the average soccer van type.
B000CMHVJO|5|My son and I installed this in 15 minutes. Just hold up template, drill 2 holes, and slip tailgate on torsion bar. Very simple and works awesome. We were all so impressed. Not many products exceed expectations for price and funtionality.  Oh, and this is my first amazon review and I buy lots of stuff from amazon, but I was compelled to spread the word. These should be standard on all full size trucks!
B00ENYJNZM|5|Works as intended
B000EVYGQY|5|Had a \\"Service Engine Soon\\" light on in my 1999 GMC Sonoma.  Bought this unit after reading the reviews.  Worked with ease right out of the box.  The reader displayed the problem code, looked the code up, cleared the dashboard light and now all is right with the world.  Would recommend this unit.
B002R885LY|5|If your running stock clutch and variator then you will have no problems. Now if your running aftermarket components then you may need a longer/shorter belt, so keep that in mind if your belt doesn't last long.
B000C59O5K|4|No problems fit perfectly and work well.Created a Stable ride.Much cheaper than i could buy locally and same product and manufacturer.
B001GJ3DZS|4|Pretty useful to clean a wheel's surface.
B002GP87NO|4|It's a sticker. I stuck it to my computer. It is about the length of the word Toshiba. It looks great.
B004XQZG88|5|Got it as a gift and she loved it! She has a huge collection of antenna balls and never found this one at Disneyland in California. Shipping was also very speedy.
B007ZT4TRE|5|Quite but has a good sound to it also lets u hear more of the engine and intake worth the money
B006M8KVJY|4|these are very easy to install. you will need a drill with a half inch bit. they are nice to have but you can't fit very much into them. you can fit a six pack of beer but not much more. they are usefull for organizing small things that you don't want rolling around but don't expect to be able to fit all your groceries in them. my wife and i like them and are still glad we bought them.
B0048DGW2A|5|Nice size bag, it also can hold the wrench inside so you have everything you need. Extra hitch pins, different size hitch balls, and plugs. Seems to be a good heavy duty bag.
B000BZIFV0|4|Used on my Triumph Sprint ST 1050, oil filter dimensions and model number as advertised.<br /><br />Box was slightly damaged on the corners, but the filter was in great shape.
B000JFJLP6|5|We bought two of them, because they work so well. They are much smaller and lighter than the branded &#34;other&#34; ones... They don't have the pump, flashlight that never works, or other stupid stuff, but they WORK. It almost never needs charging, it's amazing how many boosts you can give without a charge.
B000BYELQY|1|Problem with this is it makes samll jumps and does not wipe the water completely, maybe I have the bad part per million, but that is my situation with this blades.
B0013T415C|2|After a while all the magnet tablets were stuck together into one piece which made it uncomfortable to the driver/passenger.
B001DCJ4YW|5|Works as advertised and delivered on time.  StrongArm products have worked well for me in the past for other vehicles.
B002CGEKY2|1|This is not a good copy of the originals.  The system to affix it onto the car is not secure.  I would not recommend - I expected a better product, and returned it immediately.
B006E3SJZA|5|I used these for the license plate lights in my Subaru and they work great. The plate area is lit up nice and white as one would expect from led lights.
B0002JN3GC|2|It is currently raining cats and dogs here. I like be the wiper in that it gives a great cleaning to the windshield and no streaking occurs. So why the two stars?  The wiper keeps popping off the arm; which I don't have to point out is mighty dangerous.  It popped off four times in thirty minutes. Maybe I'm attaching it inciorrectly- but the wiper is only attaching itself one way onto the arm/- so I can't figure out how I could be doing it wrong?  Anyway- maybe you'll have more luck.
B0002SQZRC|5|Hubby likes this stuff. Meguiar's is the best!
B008JG1OOI|4|the colors are vibrant and really stand out on my car.  Its good quality Vinyl and I believe will last a long time, even in the sun. it arrived quickly in the mail and was packaged good.
B001VZL2LY|4|I bought this for my 2000 ranger 3.0  the update loaded fast and ti really improved the power on performance setting..well worth the $$$$
B001QVI57M|5|Not sure why someone was so cruel and lie about a post I made but I'm here to tell you this is the best drying towel I've ever used.<br />I can dry three large cars with ome towel, no streak.<br />I highly recommend this towel.<br />In my 30 years of detail I must say I don't know how I got by without this magic drying towel.
B0000AXRH5|5|Great product
B0016GVKCY|3|I purchase this product every year and yes it works good but pointless if doors are frozen shut so you cant get in the car in the first place. Im not talking about the locks dont lock in the winter time, Im talking about the trim around the door. Please dont suggest that i spray the trim on nice day to prevent freezing seen it done it been there doesnt work.
B0012TYYKA|1|This is a Dollar Store item.  I found this same item at the Dollar Tree for $1.  I bought this on line and found the picture not accurate with the actual item.  This item is cheap and the fabric also.  It looks like a drunk with scissors made this.  It is that cheap.<br />Save the money and buy it at the Dollar Store.  Lesson learned and it cost me $9 to learn it.<br /><br />One plus is, that it does work well with a helmet.
B00EOJNG9U|5|I've had several &#34;emergency&#34; 12v air compressors and I try to always keep one in the vehicle, so after my last super-ultra-compact-namebrand one broke (because it was a plastic piece of junk that also that took all of eternity to top raise my spare SUV tire 15psi when I had a flat) I decided to try out this unknown compressor that at least looked like decent quality from the pictures and had specs that seemed good.<br />Very impressed. I've only had it for a couple months, but I needed to increase the pressure in our SUV tires for highway driving after we deflated them a little for some rough terrain. I was expecting it to take a while since this isn't a full size compressor, but was quite pleased that it only took a couple minutes per tire. I wasn't super keen on the screw-on tire connector at first, but it actually worked like a charm and setting the tire pressure on the unit was easy (after reading the instructions).<br />I've also used it now to top off the tires before a long highway trip by bumping up the pressure from 38 to 44psi and it took less than a minute per tire.<br />The fact that it doesn't have a standard bicycle tire clamp on the end means that if you turn it on, the air starts flowing freely out the end of the hose which is handy for blowing up beach balls and other bite-valve type inflatables.<br /><br />My only slight complaint is that the 12v cord isn't quite as long as I'd like for being able to reach all the tires from a single outlet in the vehicle. However, if the cord was longer, it would also put a heavier draw on the electrical system which could cause other problems so it's not really a valid complaint.<br />It would also be nice if the pump had a label on it near the pressure setting buttons that said &#34;hold SET button 3 seconds to set pressure&#34;. Sure, it says it in the manual, but it'd be nice to have it readily visible so that you don't have to pull out the manual to get it up and running if it's been a while and you've forgotten the technique (or if you lost the manual).
B004BE7WN4|5|this is a direct replacement for the trailer lights hook up on my Toyota Tundra, 2008, with towing kit.  It is truly plug and play.
B006B2UYJS|4|Like the sound of these pipes. Tossed installation paper in trash too confusing.<br />Also should have slipped shields over pipes before install, think that would have made it a bit easier.<br />But all is good and bike sounds great.
B000AM8BF4|4|Needed a small charger to maintain my lawn equipment.  This fits the bill perfectly, plus it has the cabability of using it to jump start my vehicles if needed.  It replaces both of the chargers that I currently have had for 20+ years in one nice neat little package.
B001G4AMQ6|5|Delivered as expected,  easy to install,  no issues. Thanks
B002V0AZ0M|1|On April 4 2012 I got the part but today on May 23 when i got time to give it to mechanic to put it in my van when he open it in-front of me its used old broken part in poor packing and now when i try to return it i saw that cant return it coz my window expires on May 5 its $150 in trash now
B003BZD03K|5|Heavy duty brass
B009K9458A|5|They work awesome. Super bright and waterproof!
B001O074JU|1|These coils fixed my rough idling and hesitation at about 45 mph in my 2005 Ford F150 Lariat for about 3 weeks and then the problems got significantly worse.  I put in 8 new Motorcraft spark plugs when I replaced them.  I just went cheap on the coils, and that was my fault.  These are absolute garbage.<br /><br />I am now borrowing an extra car from my Dad while I wait for 8 new Motorcraft coils to ship.  Don't waste your time with these.
B001DRNNK8|5|Fits perfectly in 2011 Mercedes ML350.  Take 15 mins to install as you have to remove the glovebox to get to the filters.
B0009IQZFM|5|large size, effective good price.  I have a guzzler as well and this functions just as well.  for a 4 door sedan I'd recommend getting two to really dry the whole thing without a lot of wringing out
B000NN5V1M|5|Great stand, great price, very fast shipping
B00BVQZSKO|5|Purchased to enhance my hand pump vacuum brake bleeding kit.  Added an in-line fuse and cigarette lighter plug-in.  The unit cycles on and off to limit maximum vacuum.  I'm very pleased with it's operation.
B00OPBDI68|5|These lamps were a prefect fit and they look fantastic. My order came with both the driver and passenger side lamps. Also, they arrived quickly. Very high quality.
B007ZD35J8|5|Excellent quality<br />Easy installation<br />Great functionality<br /><br />Stop pondering and BUT IT NOW!
B003E2WQE4|4|The rack went together well, the instructions were adequate for the rack, but there were no instructions for the anti-wobble device.  I laid it aside, as it seems optional.<br /><br />The ramp is really too short to get a shallow enough angle to put my scooter on my pickup, dragging the middle at the changeover and hard to push up.  Also, the attachment between the ramp and rack is pretty tenuous.  On my old rack (too small for the new scooter,) the ramp had a tongue that fit into a slot on the rack, locking together when the ramp was lowered into place.  This ramp just lays on a lip and shifts off while I try to push the scooter up.
B00B5XX6VQ|5|Oem like they said good quality
B0087XOTWW|1|My truck has %20 tint over the stock %24 tint thus backing up at night can be problematic. While the lights are bright the projection is horrible.<br />Save yourself the time and money and buy these instead:<br />http://www.amazon.com/iJDMTOY-Extremely-Bright-5-piece-Reverse/dp/B00CORBQUA
B009MATOD8|5|This sun shade fits perfectly in my 2014 VW Passat. Good quality.
B000FOUXWQ|3|Needed a new shower head for my boat which failed after 18 years.  If this one lasts as long, I will be very happy.
B00230QCIY|5|Yes great do you sell carb kits
B00CEKWLF6|5|Based on the review from another user i purchased the kit. i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pipes, couplers (silicon 4-ply) and clamps.  I'll be using these pipes to fabricate a cold side by cutting and welding. i was a bit concerned that the pipes would be some thin cheap ones but they are not. I didn't measure them but they appear to be between 14 and 16 gauge. Plenty of meat on the pipes for what i need. Definitely a good value based on the contents of the kit.
B002MOAHCI|5|Sweet fog lights. Nice flat beam with clean cut-off. Easy install. Mounts seem solid and easily adjustable. Wire gauge kinda light, but should be okay.<br />Large, round lens looks right on my vintage step-van, and really fills in the gaps in coverage of weak stock headlights.
B004L67L42|4|Just the tool needed to raise the wheel up to the studs. The only way it could be better is if the forks had rollers to be able to rotate the wheel to align with the studs.
B008SOQOLE|4|Great product.
B005UXYV3E|5|its the parts required  fine
B002MQFTLU|5|I bought two of these for my sisters car. Got the shipment on time and cost around 5 dollars for both. Quality is even better than stock handles. After watching a video on YouTube it took me only five minutes to install them. Don't pay 30-40 dollars to get it installed. You can do it by watching http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N6xnQklr0qE . All you needs is a Phillips screwdriver and 5 minutes.
B0022ZQ154|5|Bolted right on.  No modifications to my 4-wheeler at all.
B002R0YOMG|4|The replacement was very easy to install, and I liked that it came with the lens and light bulb. It was not perfectly flushed (not a perfect fit), but it does the job.
B004R322HK|5|This item was perfect for my 2011 Subaru Outback!<br /><br />While the instructions could have been a little clearer, a quick web search led to multiple pages and videos on installation. Very easy to install and doesn't require drilling into the car.<br /><br />Installed in a few minutes with the help of my doggy.
B00SI4NK6Q|5|Perfect fit
B002YXC0A4|3|What more can you say for a product that has only one moving part? It works. Like most of this type of valve (diaphragm), the gas flow is either full-on, almost off, or off. But that's enough to get the job done. My valve doesn't leak, hasn't come apart, and if it's like the one I replaced, it will last me another 20 years. And Camco Mfg. seems to be the only manufacturer that produces these valves.<br /><br />BTW, this review is not from Amazon, it's from me, and its about the valve.
B00BBJVE2M|4|I bought this to add extra capacity to my son's '73 super beetle.  It's hard to believe that factory, these engines hold 2.5 quarts.  I'll feel a lot better adding another 1.5 quarts as well as an external oil filter/pump unit to his car.  I'll update this after I have completed them both.
B005HEZG1W|5|Parts fit perfectly,<br />Website is full of other products,<br />Customer service is great.<br />Have bought more products after this purchase.<br />My Volvo is rolling with zing.. But I still watch for pot holes.  LoL.  But speed bumps are no threat.<br /><br />#winning #deal#shop the wed site.<br />#what is # anyway.
B005ZNKNHC|4|Helmet is great but the sizing is a bit small. If you take out the ear padding all is good.
B003EQ9QAW|5|Exactly what I ordered and needed.
B000TE46SY|4|works fine at the fraction of the price of more expensive models,it probably is not something you would use daily.should work fine for anyone whatever your level may be..
B003UTH088|5|My Chevrolet dealer programmed this key fob perfectly!!!  Big discount in price here!  I'm very satisfied!!!
B006R0XYGY|5|I bought these for a 2010 Prius to replace the dull dome light that comes from the factory. This size is slightly larger than the OEM bulb, but a little flexing of the metal got it in. Looks great. Shipped very quickly.
B000CLQQUK|5|Kit contained every part needed to be a good quality rebuild of the ZS Carb. including a part diagram.  All parts needed to do a minor overhaul, gaskets, &#34;o&#34; rings, new jet, new diaphragms.  Everything you need in one place to do the job.  Stopped leaks in the carb. that were a fire hazard.  Acceleration restored.
B006KOQA54|5|Everything OK. Initially, they shipped 1 rotor instead of 2 but this was solved properly.
B00GBZDI98|5|Also good and I like it too.
B000WEPI4M|4|Fits my needs.
B00757KJTI|5|Had to discontinue use as local signals were dropping.  Went back to old antenna. Local 1200 watt channel would drop out while driving on local loop.
B0009H51TO|5|Great replacement filter for my 96 camaro!
B000GZCM46|4|Replaced all four struts on my '01 Elantra GLS. The work was easy. The only complaint was with the packaging. The shock arm had pocked itself outside of the package. The unit was not immobilized sufficiently to prevent it from moving around while shipping. I did not see any damage on the arm. Besides that mishap, I would purchase this strut again.
B007HG7SM8|1|I bought two of these to replace my old connectors. Worked great for 6 months but now one of them is leaking at the end that connects to the regulator. Now I need to buy another one and hope it lasts longer than 6 months.
B000FW61SI|2|These Super Shields were found to have heavy , large scratches on their surfaces upon opening.  The scratches were in place BEFORE opening, not created by opening!!  In addition, the shields vision areas were distinctly distorted--altho not to be viewed thru vision areas, I don't believe the plastic should reveal such distortion.  There you go with my rating!!!............................
B000DN7Q3S|5|I have had these on for several months at this point and everything seems to be working fine.  I'm not sure what the expected life is but I feel like they are a good value.
B001KMJ6DE|5|awesome
B001763SRI|1|This lasted about a month on the very textured dashboard of a 2012 Honda CR-V.  Now, the adhesive backing has peeled away from the disc itself.  Alas, I have to look for other solutions...
B00GU988J0|4|The part was as noted. Was priced well and fit in as if new.
B00CPFLIH2|5|Snug perfect fit.
B00O0U2ET6|5|Soft and plush.  Keeps my steering wheel from being freezing to touch in the winter.  Haven't had any problems with slipping.  Exactly what I was looking for.
B00NX4FE6A|5|Great.
B007EXO4NK|5|ORDERED THE LOCK, PERFECTLY MATCHED ORIGINAL LOCK. QUALITY PRODUCT, WORKS JUST THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.
B00JA3BMDW|4|it is a solid build product. I have been trying it for some times in different occasions and overall feeling happy with it. the only think I noticed not ideal is accuracy for human body temperature is off a bit, it is always about 2 degrees lower.
B0090HJZ0K|5|Perfect looks beautiful on my car!!
B004KL0I9I|3|The unit I got suffered from the non-unique MAC address problem (11:22:33:DD:EE:FF) discussed on the Torque forums and which end-users are advised to not use for the reasons stated there-in. I'm keeping mine anyway because I am a very casual user that bought this for the \\"gee whiz\\" factor but if I were a car enthusiast I would send it back. The more of these floating around the worse the interference problem from strangers is going to become. You have been advised/warned.
B00361WTZE|5|Amazing product
B003LFMCQG|5|I've had this cover for several months now. I am still happy with my purchase. I haven't taken it off since I installed it. Great for traveling. Better fuel mileage. It has a clean, low profile that looks really nice on the truck. It does drip, but that hasn't been an issue yet with anything I have in the back. I don't have to worry about someone stealing a cooler, fishing gear, straps, etc while I run into a store. Nobody is using my bed as a trash can when I'm in a parking lot.
B009URIQMI|1|Installed this on my car in September 2014 and this is December 2014 and 2 of them have gone out already, within weeks of each other.
B004I0MHSQ|5|Hit a deer and broke the side marker light.  Installed easily in my '02 Forester and it looks like new / light work perfectly.  Came with a bulb in it.
B005SSBONG|5|After replacing the shock struts, by car regained its stability. It was not easy to compress the back of the car to get it down. I think this is a great OEM. I would recommend it if you are looking forward for a replacement.
B00KQY8T1W|5|The packaging clearly states &#34;Set of 2&#34;, but there is only one mitt the package.  I was contacted by Raverra and they immediately offered to send a second mitt.  Possibly Amazon sent them the wrong SKU...  I used the single mitt today and it worked flawlessly.
B000ECTMNU|5|Great kit. Ordered mine a while back finally got around to installing it. Everything came in the box. Suspension feels great. springs don't slam the car, but just get it just a bit lower. 1/2&#34; front 3/4&#34; rear. Just what I was looking for. No after market camber or toe kits required with this setup. No issues with the alignment.<br /><br />This kit is for those like me, who just wanna to hit the corners a little harder.
B008DJ6ZR2|5|I have a d16z6 in my 93 honda eg. Everything shipped perfectly with no dents or scratches and fit very well. It was a bit of snug fit but fit just fine. So far no bad reviews for Spec D :).<br />PS it sounds great at idle and rev!<br /><br />Quick update; had it for a few months now and everything is holding up perfectly. The guy in another review said it sounded like a fan sucking in a lot of air. That is a a good thing. The sound he is talking about is just the air flowing through the piping(which air flow is what u want).  Loudest cold air intake I've owned to date and turned MANY heads with it
B00IX4CMM4|5|Great lights!  I purchased these for my 2011 Infiniti G37x sedan and they took about 10 minutes to install since I had to change the logo to the Infiniti one.  My original order came with one defective light and I had to return and reorder via Amazon.
