1250029465|3.0|I generally like books about animals, and the plot of this one is compelling, but I wish the writing had a bit more shine to it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great way to watch Netflix, Youtube, and listen to Google Music, and I feel like there is so much more potential with the Google Chromecast when more features are added.  \\"Casting\\" a chrome browser tab is pretty snappy right now, although a little laggy, and kind of weird to browse on the laptop while it is being displayed on the tv.  Overall, Netflix, Youtube and google music are worth the $35, but I would bet there's more to come (ie. Picasa, Google plus, etc.)
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is just a brilliant show. Nathan Fillion is a god, and this show allows him and the rest of the cast to really build their characters and have fun. I love the second season and am excited to collect the others.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Great book. The pace was good. It didnt get stagnate in any perticular chapter. If you like fantasy, read this.
B004I744AS|4.0|good for Lpn student's really help during anatomy and physiology serious stuff and other times good for anyone in the medical field
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My kids steal my Kindle Fire in order to play this game all the time :)<br />good for all ages..
B00A8ECU24|5.0|DON'T GiVE IN! seriously... don't buy anything... That's where these free to play models kill the fun... Have patience grasshoppers
0375850864|3.0|This recent Newbery winner presents a complicated mystery--as well as the age-old dilemma of the time-space continuum: is time travel at least theoretically possible?  Sixth-graders Miranda and her neighborhood pal, Sal, are comfortable with their life in 1979 New York City. The only eccentricities she notices are the crazy antics of a \\"jumping man\\" at the corner mailbox and her mother's obsession with appearing on the TV game show: $25.00 Pyramid. Attending middle school (before it was even Called a middle school) these kids have their friends and their daily activities so life seems okay.<br /><br />Then strange things start happening: her dead father's shoes go missing--as does the hidden spare apartment key; Sal is punched in the face by an older boy for absolutely no reason. Most puzzling of all: Miranda starts receiving mysterious letters from--she has no idea whom. Letters which she is urged to keep secret and not reveal to anyone. What kind of a sick hoax is this?  At home she coaches and preps her mother for an appearance on her beloved game show, with the dream of wining enough money not to have to worry about paying the rent.<br /><br />Bound together by mysteries and tween-age social concerns WHEN YOU REACH ME also unashamedly promotes Madeline L'Engle' Sci Fi book, A WRINKLE IN TIME; perhaps because that seems to be what Miranda is personally experiencing. (It is rare to find any YA book pushing another one in the very text, but it does lend the flavor of the pre-1980's (complete with the smell of purple mimeograph ink) to the story.<br /><br />  Miranda learns some solemn and valuable life lessons just from her normal human relationships--about friendship and job ethics. She even makes the acquaintance of an older youth--who suggests that time travel may indeed be possible. At least he treats her crazy theories with dignity. Is there a future relationship brewing there for her?  Should she really follow the instructions of her mystery correspondent ( akind of pen pal from the future--or is it the past). Details of the 1979 blend with contemporary school and home life--as the present blurs with Before and After. When Miranda and readers puzzle out the identify of the YOU and the ME of the four letters, she realizes that her life will never be the same again--but it will be a gift that she alone can claim!
B0061S0A64|3.0|Fun for a while, but gets boring. Good if you're just looking for a beat to play with, but not much entertainment longer than about 10 minutes.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Loved the fast paced, interesting story line. The characters were believable and you could actually imagine this happening. Would recommend it. Off to buy the next one straight away!
B002ZG983M|5.0|Great movie I enjoyed it tremendously! Part two should be just as good if not better! my daughter should be as skilled!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|...but even better character development! Hugh Howey described himself as a &#34;nobody&#34; & says that's why the Silo Saga stories are so inexpensive. I put him in with my favorite sci-fi authors...and they are mostly the heavyweights. Will happily go looking for more by this self-proclaimed &#34;nobody.&#34;
B00499NHLC|5.0|The best show I've ever seen I love it.Can not wait to see more shows.Glad to see the episodes.hooray for Sherlock
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be. Good twists and deception. If you like movies where you think you know whats going on but you really don't at the end, you will like it..
0525478817|5.0|This book should be given to everyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you think. I can't say enough about this book, but everything I try to say makes it seem less than it is. Trust me, you should read this book.
B002KGEORM|5.0|The show is great. Give it an episode or 2 and your hooked. It is much better then I expected for a show is of this subject matter and doesn't use profanity.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I DONT LIKE IT I LOVE  IT IMMENSLEY TO MY HEART AND SOUL THATS WHY I NEED IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE .I GO TO BED WITH CANDY CRUSH SAGA AND WAKE WITH IT. PLEASE PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE GET THE DOWNLOAD OF THE GAME ITS A WELL PLAYED GAME WORLD WUDE. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This movie is so funny! It's a great movie for all ages. Thanks amazon for a clear movie. love it.
B008XNPO20|5.0|The vinyl is in great condition, it was delivered a few days earlier than estimated, and the sound is just so pure! I am glad to have made this purchase, well worth it!
B001NOD0Q8|5.0|This was a phenomenal book!  I simply could not put it down and stayed up late into the night to finish it.  I was completely stunned at the final \\"training\\" battle scene and felt horrible for Ender.  I must admit though, each time I'd really get into the story and the characters, it was quite a jolt to be reminded that these were mostly 6 - 12 year old boys.  I kept wanting to read about Ender as an adult to discover what kind of man he grew up to be.  Fortunately, there is the sequel - Speaker for the Dead.<br /><br />I loved it and put it on my 12 year old son's reading list.
0345803485|5.0|I love the book, i rarely get a chance to read. But i finished it in two days. yes its kinky but has a great love story
B005544TRQ|4.0|This is witty, well written and the characters are well played. The love stories aren't that great, but that's good, I'd rather it be about the character development than romance. Good show. Hot actors ;)
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|One of the funniest shows you will ever see. The Blu Ray is really cool, and it arrived fast. I couldn't wait to watch it again.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|for ANY Soundgarden/Chris Cornell fan. Love, love, love this disc. It is in my CD/alarm clock now and I wake up to Chris's bluesy voice every morning.
B003VW54QO|5.0|ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES....LOVE IT... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!! GOOD ACTING: DEAN MARTIN.... WATCH IT OVER END OVER.... HIHLY RECOMMENDED
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did like how this was written and the story line. The characters where believable, even if you hated them. The author used quite a few swear words in her character conversations. I know people talk that way, but it is not needed to tell the story. I found it distracting to the point I almost did not finish the book. Even now after having read the book earlier in the summer, that's what I remember more than the story.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|All through the movie (3D version) the colour was greenish, washed out and seemed to have poor resolution. I tried all (Panasonic Projector) picture modes and adjusted Colour, Brightness, Contrast etc. in each, even stopped the movie and substituted other 3D discs to check the system performance, which were all good with rich colours and a sharp picture. Nothing I could do would improve the picture quality.  Updated:- I have just run the non-3d unedited version: the colours etc. were fine. The problem is with the 3D version.<br /><br />The somewhat ludicrous theme of endless instant Zombies with superhuman strength, speed and agility (what happened to torn tendons and broken bones?)who seem to bite once, spreading a plague and thereafter run around snarling without any obvious way of feeding and replenishing their body resources. So the defense is for everyone to be infected with something deadly? Really?<br /><br />What these movies about society's destruction don't address is the following issue:  There are the all-to-frequent post-apocalyptic themes (think Kevin Costner in Postman or the recent Revolution where helicopters work fine after being unused for 30 years;... try using 30 year old fuel!) where massive world wide destruction has left few intact enclaves and somehow they will rebuild the future, despite complete collapse of the global economy, telecommunications, internet, transportation, power generation, petroleum production, supply chains, industry, medicine, universities etc. (try, as a shade tree mechanic, fixing a modern car without computer diagnostics tools and parts made in Taiwan. Now try it 30 years later!). This movie avoids the \\"What's next?\\" issue. I think that the Sci-Fi community deserves better. We don't mind the wildest ideas nor even the trashing of known scientific principals, as long as a plausible reason is given.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|It's such a great show!  I started watching from the first season at the beginning of the summer on Amazon Instant Video and have now caught up and am ready for the first episode of the Fifth Season.  I can't wait.  I really love it! The cases are so interesting and the lives of the actors in the show have you on the edge of your seat.  I completely recommend it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This show is superior to most network series, in terms of writing, plot, cast and acting.  Personally I love it because it's teeming with courtroom scenes and legal drama!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|SAME ASTHE OTHER JOHN WAYNE MOVIES,  LOVE IT TOO.... I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF WAYNE SINCE I WAS A BOY, ..RECOMMENDED..
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I could listen to Tina Fey every day. She is so smart and so very funny. I really looked forward to reading her book. There are some really funny parts to the book but not enough to carry the book. I do not recommend this book. That said, my thirty-something daughter loved it. So it is probably a generational thing.
1451695195|5.0|A friend of mine asked me to order this book for her son.  I never read it, though I have seen the author interviewed by<br />Dr. Oz.  I am convinced that he had a genuine experience.
B001AEF6CW|5.0|Got this for my brother as a present, he was delighted to get it, and it makes for a hilarious piece to have out
B004ZH66XO|1.0|This game is NOT free (or going to be free) of ads/IAPs. If you remember their other recent FaotD (missile defenders), that game also had no IAPs and no ads for the FaotD promotion. Now, it has both ads and IAPs.<br /><br />Not only this, but about 2 weeks ago I checked this game (because it was FaotD a long time ago), and it had IAPs. I can't be certain it had ads, but the game gets increasingly impossible until you are forced to quit or buy items.  I don't like these bait and switch tactics (but since the dev doesn't get money from Amazon I understand why it's done).
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Super fun to play. Much better than the previous version. My kids love to watch me racing. Have to do lots of races to make money in main mode.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is written from the view point of a teenage girl. It is very poignant. She describes her family and friends and the situation she finds herself in quite well. It is a hard book to put down. As you read you start thinking about mortality and what does hold us to this mortal existence. I highly recommend the book. It is well written and the characters are believable and endearing.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|I enjoyed it for the historicity and the characterization of Chaplin as a man who was not only talented but hardworking (to a fault).
0790742780|5.0|I think this is one of the best films of all time, and I am glad to have it in my collection
B00F35BV64|5.0|From the moment the movie started I was drawn in and it kept me interested until the last scene. Really for a 2 hr movie, it was worth the money. If you are a Trekie, it's worth the rental fee.
B0085BNIXM|5.0|super great baseball movie. funny exciting and well made.i watched it with a basball freand. and we hade a lot of laffs! and exciting moments.this belongs with aney great basball movie. a big must see! better then most ive seen .if you like basball like we do. dont miss this.
B00006RIO7|4.0|It is not the sound track. But it has all the favorite songs from the movie. It also has some that didn't make it into the movie. There is one at the end by Queen Latifa, which is quite nice.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a good book, but it is a children's book.  As an adult, it was entertaining but not terribly intellectually stimulating.  However, it is a very easy read, so it was well worth the time spent reading it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am enjoying this series so far. Alicia is a fantastic character with depth and personality. She is thrust into the spotlight with her husbands scandal of sex and corruption at the DA's office. In her college training years Alicia graduated from Georgetown as a lawyer---to take care of her family she accepts a job at a large firm. Needless to say Alicia is like-able her family has real challenges with teenagers at home. Alicia is basically a single mother making her challenges even more endearing as she juggles work, kids, and visiting Peter(husband) in jail.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|I loved this movie. It grabs your attention from the very beginning and keeps you pinned to seat. Graphics were sensational. Terrific movie!!!
B0081336FO|5.0|The acting is excellent and the story is sharp and riveting.  I am surprised that this series has so few episodes.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I agree with Michael Crawford, the original Angel of Music:  the music of the night came to an end at the end of Phantom.<br /><br />And I will say something that Michael Crawford is much too sweet and humble to say:  the music of the night was over the last time he sang the role.<br /><br />This production struck me as a rather maudlin effort to capitalize on the amazing popularity of the other musical.  No way does it have the magic or depth of the original.  Sorry, fans.  Did not like the story at all.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|I've been waiting the release of Adam Grant's book since hearing an interview with Dan Heath earlier this year. I began reading the book on vacation and was mesmerized by the powerful use of story combined with data and research Adam uses to debunk the myth that nice guys and gals finish last. Hopefully this book inspires and encourages massive numbers of people to rethink their view of giving and fuels the growth of giving in both communities and corporations.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loooovvveeeedddd. Thais book it kept me on the end of my seat until the very end. I would truly suggest reading this book
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|Well done!  Kept our attention throughout the show.  Interesting plot and based on true story.  Attention to detail regarding era appreciated as well.
B000ID37SQ|3.0|Interesting to see how the Cubans were perceived and treated upon entering the U.S.  Drugs are devastating to their way of life.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|missis's. maddening. addiction<br />I didn't really get this game right at first.  but I love it. I can bearly stay off it now it should be classified as an addicting games
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sad to see my friends leave but a great end to a great series! You will not be disappointed with this book.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Loved it! As a horror fan, I found this to be creepy and strange, and just as good, if not better than American Horror Story Asylum. My husband watched the &#34;Asylum&#34; series with me and enjoyed it, but found this one to be &#34;too much&#34; for him to watch. At times, it was a bit predictable, but it held my attention nonetheless. I did not, however, see Violet's conclusion coming. Ending was a bit cheesy, but I didn't mind too much.
B00B2166BS|4.0|...but unnecessarily expensive. These will be well worth the money once they hit $15 or less. Not a bad purchase however.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I was honestly just watching because Charlie was cast as CG.  HOWEVER, I am beyond impressed with this show. Fantastic story telling!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this alarm clock I have been using it for almost a year now and it works great I would definitely recommend this alarm clock it's great.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is one of the best albums of AC/DC, I love it. Highly recommend it to any rock lover.<br />Highway to Hell!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Gaga's best song yet! Can't wait for ARTPOP! It's going to be Lady Gaga's best album! She has managed to combined her fun sound from The Fame with art
0744014956|5.0|This is THE guide for Grand Theft Auto 5, beware of fakes, if you want the REAL thing get it now.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I was honestly just watching because Charlie was cast as CG.  HOWEVER, I am beyond impressed with this show. Fantastic storytelling!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game is awesome I can't believe it I wish the new levels would come out now it is just to fun
B003M70O5O|5.0|I generally don't watch tv, but this show is fresh and keeps you watching!!  It will keep you up late at night to watch just one more episode
B005544TRQ|5.0|Our favorite new show! Love it! We can't stop watching. Very witty and well written. Now we are addicted to Suits.
B000JML90Y|3.0|We have both a Kindle Fire HD and a Paperwhite.  I first downloaded this to the Paperwhite.  It is not at all suitable for the smaller device.  Looks great on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />I love the Paperwhite for reading, but some books just don't show up well on it.  This is one of them.  The book references pictures and figures that do not show up on the Paperwhite, leaving the reader missing much of what Darwin expressed.  Also, the formatting is off, not a very good presentation on the Paperwhite.<br /><br />On the Kindle Fire HD, everything is present and looks good.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|.This game is awesome but it is too short needs more stuff. I will try more G5 games in the future.
0007444397|5.0|Awesome product, these guys have an amazing story. The product was at my place on time, a very responsible deliver... Thanks for it!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Great local artist and collaborations from a variety of musicians incorporated into a beautiful array of 15songs. Couldn't love this more
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the NBHD and this disc is just the greatest. Some of their best songs are on here and the disc was delivered in a very prompt fashion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The settings, the colors, the costumes and the customs of that period in history are all portayed by an excellent cast - especially Dame Maggie Smith!  So sit back, relax and enjoy peeking in on a bygone era.  Let Downton Abbey transport you.......
1451695195|4.0|The sobriety of the early NDE accounts from Dr. Moody, Dr. Perry and Dr. Long harshly contrast with the verbose NDE litterature of the recent years. Nevertheless, Dr. Alexander's personal history, his careful presentation, the content of his testimony and the passion with which he shares his experience cement for me his credibility as a witness.  Without these conditions, such an elaborate NDE would elicit some doubts. I hope many will benefit from this striking book.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I got this, but hesitated for a bit. It looked kind of stupid but once I got it, I couldn't put it down. I think this is a great game and recommend it to anyone!<br /><br />The basic idea of the game is to bounce a tennis ball around the map and hit all the guys. It starts out very simple, but eventually it gets a bit more difficult.<br /><br />The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it is to eat, although there were some levels that were tough, it could have been harder, and a bit longer!<br /><br />Otherwise really good game. Worth the $2.99!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great graphics, but who would expect less. Fun addition to my collection of Angry Bird games. Cannot say enough positive things about any of these games from Rovio. Lucas Arts does a great job too.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I rooted for the bad guys and the good guy in this film. Mark Ruffalo was as charming and easy to relate to as ever, and the magicians/thieves, while annoying individually, were delightful as a team.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I found the television show interesting so I thought I would give the book a try. If you are interested in memoirs depicting the strength of human spirit, this is a great choice. I was amazed by Pipers compassion, but most of all I was inspired to find accounts of true human kindness given by people who are unfortunately stereo typed otherwise.<br /><br />I initially chose this book to read all the salacious entertainment of the show, and I was disappointed to see how manipulated the story came to the screen. But they are both still interesting.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I thought this to be a fascinating, academic treatise on a sensitive topic to modern day Christians. Some of the authors arguments were speculative and some conclusions unconvincing. But overall, an excellent review of the historical facts of Christianity.  For some Christians, it will destroy their faith; for others, it would strengthen faith in the God who created us and gave us the greatest gift - the gift of choice and free will.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game and one week later it deleted itself from my Kindle and erased any trace of me buying the game, that may just be my problem but while I had the game it was awesome
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love it, just wish I can get &quot;tokens&quot;faster!!!!!! But it's a great game over all, haven't had a problem!!!! Wonderful game
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I very much enjoyed the slow reveal of the mystery in this film, and Tom Cruise did a fantastic job as he struggled to understand everything. The world building was as perfect as Minority Report, and the action was heart-pounding.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love this show. Stimulates the imagination through novel scientific &#34;experiments&#34; that often threaten to destroy the world. But the &#34;non-genius&#34; sherrif solves the quirky mysteries and saves the day, or world. Uses real scientific theories to build fun, though somewhat outrageous, story lines. Characters are awesome. And who can't enjoy a show with the &#34;science guy&#34; playing a whacky veterinarian. Super IQ dogs, town full of geniuses hidden from the world. So cool. An absolute favorite.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good what i call &quot;timewaster&quot; game. Just a brain came that doesn't make you think too hard.  Colorful tiles. Cool layouts of the puzzles.
B000002KFJ|5.0|BLACK SABBATH!!! What else is there to say, but BLACK SABBATH. An awesome having some dark essence to it, but musically it seems that there is a hint of main stream.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love relax melodies.I watch my grandson early in the morning and I put him to sleep with the sounds of the ocean.He goes right out.lol
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|The action was great, and RDJ and Paltrow's performance were wonderful. The villains were pretty cool too. It was a bit tough to follow during the final battle scene, but I really enjoyed it. Especially Paltrow getting all badass.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|the bible never showed up on tablet. im just glad it was not expensive. I hate technology. thanks for nothing
0316201545|5.0|I love this book so much. This story is so interesting and touching. When I reached the ending I cannot stop crying. I'm so into the story. Characters are very funny, especially Red which is my fav character in the book. Even though it's a thick book, I just cannot stop reading because I was eager to know what is gonna happen latter. I bought them to my younger sisters, hope them could enjoy it as much as I do. :D  full of love.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great TV series if you like law and politics. My wife and I are hook on this show. Watching an episode per night before we go to bed has become a ritual.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I liked reading this book because the writer kept the plot moving along nicely.  The frequent Yorkshire dialog takes getting accustomed to and can cause re-reading of some conversations between Mary and Martha.  However, I enjoyed the book very much and highly recommend it.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I haven't even uploaded a picture yet, I'm still an egg. So I think is to premature for me to give an opinion of this device. But it offers so much data and ways to know other individuals and that makes it very interesting.

B00AB55BS0|5.0|Liked it all.  The entire is series is one you can't miss.  Waiting for the next disk and the follow on.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great reading for anyone looking to tap in to their inner spirit and realize the power their thoughts hold.<br />Simple read, Simple exercises. Loved it.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|The movie is phenomenal.  It has very catchy music and a hilarious plot line.  I recommend this to all of my music lover friends and movie fanatics alike!  I have the album and everything.  It came packaged very well and safe.  I will definitely shop for movies this way in the future!

B005UKK4Y2|5.0|What a cast....funny people....great chemistry between actors...first time I had seen Anniston in this type of role(dark comedy) and she was great.....Bateman fans will love it....funny, funny, funny.
0887431453|5.0|I bought this for my three year old who is currently homeschooled due to severe food allergies. Not only is it teaching him how to read and write letters, but now he shows interest in actually doing the worksheets! A must have for anyone with a preschooler!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As always, Masterpiece Theater is well-acted, well-written and intriguing.  Just wish each season was a little longer. Looking forward to new episodes.
B008220BLG|5.0|I Loove this movie, Nicholas had a great beaktrough on this film. You shall all see it! :-) ja ja
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Great I love pinball games because I can keep up with it and Star Wars is top shelf too big time
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|Knew it would suck when the volume for voices was half that of sound effects....trick of untalented directors for shock.....truly the WORST movie ever....wow did it suck....can't describe how bad it was....not enough pot in the world to make this tolerable.....bad, just......bad. The worst movie I had ever seen before this was three times better.....ughhh.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent read!  If you enjoyed 50 Shades you would love this series just as much, if not more.  I can't wait for the next book to be released!
B005D4YOQY|4.0|These Keen sandals are very similar to a pair of black nylon Keen sandals that I was replacing after 8 years.  The footbed is the same size with the same fit.<br /><br />A couple of observations:<br /><br />- I wish the tongue area of the sandal would come up just a little bit higher.<br />- The cinch laces could stand to be a little bit longer.<br />- This footbed seems to be a bit firmer and is taking a little longer to break in.
0399226907|5.0|This book is amazing, cant wait to have the opportunity to use it, and all its great activities! :-) Love it
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Beautifully written, absorbing book.  A departure for me but definitely worth it.  I loved the kernels of wisdom that would dro unexpectedly from the pages - each containing a great truth or revelation.  The themes of love, honor, redemption, surrender, and forgiveness continue to inspire me and I catch myself thinking about it and paraphrasing it often in conversation.  If I could write a great novel this is how I'd aspire to do it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|, loved it, easy story to read. Brings back a lot of memories. great trip into the world of the unknown. J.Watson
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I enjoyed the insight into the federal prison system, but I don't think the writing wad very strong. This book reads more like a list of incidences. At best, it's a compilation of short stories, but it never builds into a full novel. Kerman begins a story but never really takes it anywhere. I enjoyed the contents of the book, but found the writing style and craft a bit amateur, even lazy. It's worth a skim.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Last year we chose in our middle school this book.E everyone read the book, the awareness to bullying was high, discussions were happening everywhere.<br />The message in the book was very clear!!!!
B009RX85N0|5.0|I wasnt sure of what to expect from this show, but I loved S. 2, waiting for s. 3 :-)
B00BGI076M|3.0|Oh, man. This was a show I really wanted to love. It has two of my favorite actors, Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy. It has a solid supporting cast with the likes of Natalie Zea, Annie Parrise and Shawn Ashmore. It seemed to have a solid plot.<br /><br />However, in THE FOLLOWING, Fox's latest attempt to get more \\"edgy\\", it bludgeons the viewer with every single possible cliche in almost every episode. It's a veritable clown car of character tropes, red herrings, laughably bad dialogue, abysmal plotting, and narcoleptic performances.<br /><br />Here's the plot: Ryan Hardy (Bacon) is a former FBI profiler who was once involved with the chase, and ultimately the capture, of charismatic college professor and failed writer (and co-ed serial killer) Joe Carroll (Purefoy), whose killings have the shared theme of Edgar Allan Poe-style murders. Hardy is wounded badly in the capture and now has a pacemaker. Since the capture, he's drowned himself in alcohol and wrote a book about the Carroll case. Suddenly, Carroll escapes his maximum-facility incarceration and intends to continue his murder spree with his \\"following\\"; a cult of various murderous misanthropes who have all been bitten by the crazy bug. Hardy is brought back into the fray, so that Carroll can continue his game of cat and mouse with Hardy, but with Carroll's followers, all who have impossibly played out various roles of importance to Hardy and the people around him, remain one step ahead. It's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS meets The Manson Family.<br /><br />Showrunner Kevin Williamson, who rightly made a name for himself with the SCREAM films, has very little faith in the target audience for a show of this type. It's a consistent insult to the intelligence of those who watch the show as the FBI and Hardy stumble around like the Keystone Kops, feebly attempting to quell the murders, but also to save Carroll's ex-wife (Zea) who Ryan is in love with, and Carroll's son. It's as if none of the pursuing forces have more than three or four brain cells functioning at any given time, EXCEPT when the plot requires them to suddenly become brilliant.<br /><br />With maybe the exception of Purefoy, every cast member, especially Bacon, seems to just be cashing a check here. Bacon has never EVER been as dull as his performance is in this show. Even he seems to be asking himself, \\"Why am I in this idiotic show?\\" as he lumbers from plot point to plot point. Purefoy at least seems like he's having some fun here playing Hannibal Lec... ahem... I mean, Joe Carroll as he chews his way through most of the scenery in the show.<br /><br />So why three stars? Because at the end of every episode, after I've been screaming at the television about how stupid the FBI are, I find myself taken with the idea that the series in and of itself is a long-form parody of these types of stories. Williamson was all about playing against the stereotypes while playing with them in SCREAM, and for whatever reason, I believe that this show is somehow totally aware of how bad it is, and is willing to keep making itself more and more idiotic and implausible as the season went on.<br /><br />Either that, or THE FOLLOWING is really one of the worst shows in recent memory. It's probably the latter, but I kind of hope it's the former.hree or four brain cells functioning at any given time, EXCEPT when the plot requires them to suddenly become brilliant.<br /><br />With maybe the exception of Purefoy, every cast member, especially Bacon, seems to just be cashing a check here.

B0064MGU98|5.0|I am hooked.  Quality cast and content.  I am currently watching season two and so far it is just as addictive as season one.
0307476073|4.0|If my daughter had written this I would have strongly urged her to be more restrained in talking about her sex life. If my mother had written this I would be very embarrassed and hope that no one would know she was my mother. Intimacy comes from keeping some things private. The book is well written and interesting, and could have been successful without the sex.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer has been one of my favorites for some time.  He is constantly evolving, but always true to the music.<br />Great album.
0762451319|4.0|I agree with some of the other reviews which complain about the length of the necklace, but, it still fits and the chain is comfortable. Besides, you can always replace the chain if it truly bothers you that much. The tattoos are fun to mess with and look pretty damn awesome. The little booklet thing is kind of fun to just look at, it's pretty small, but, oh well! && Last, but not least, the magnets are cool as well. So, if you want a cheap set of some Mortal Instruments merchandise this is the thing for you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I know a lot of people didn't like the ending, but I thought it was perfect and thought provoking.<br /><br />I like a book that still has me thinking about it a week, two weeks, a month later.<br /><br />And when I read my next novel which seemed impossible, and 3/4 of the way through, I thought I hate all the main characters and I would be happy if the book ended with me hating all the main characters, so long as they stay true to form. The book ended reasonably happily - but I think it would have been better if it didn't.<br /><br />I'm happy the next book I read ended in the normal satisfactory way, but I will forget it tomorrow. But I won't forget Gone Girl.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Listening to this record, I would swear that it's 1986 again.  This fits in with anything Iron Maiden ever did.  It has the same feel as a Maiden record.  I never paid much attention to Saxon when I was in high school, but I heard the name.  This is really good.  There isn't a bad song on the entire CD and there is nothing negative I can say about it.  This is one of those records that you want to listen to repeatedly and it only gets better with every subsequent listen.  This is highly recommended to anyone who likes mid-eighties heavy metal.  \m/ \m/
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|An industrial designer who specializes in kinetic products, our son put this on his Amazon wish list.  He says he has it in a big plastic tub and enjoys it immensely.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I am a big fan of ballads and these are great songs.  Nobody does pathos, and both sides of love better.  Great musicians.
0440237688|5.0|i am happy because i got this book in two days & now i am catching up in class because of you.
B00000JBFW|5.0|Whatever happened to Deep Purple after their &#34;live&#34; album? This tells the story! Well worth buying! There are some amazing tracks on this CD!
0515142247|5.0|I like the Jack Reacher character.  DIE TRYING was exciting and well written.  I almost started hyperventilating when Reacher was squirming his way through the tiny, claustrophobic tunnel in the mountain.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|This product is not worth the money.  I paid for this expensive gadget to record my pulse. The activity tracker I could do on a $10 pedometer.  It will sync with my iphone but it will not take my pulse.  Furthermore, when I try to use that feature the whole thing freezes and I have to do a hard shutdown by holding the button down for 15 seconds to reset. I like the small size because I can tuck it in my bra and not lose it.  The battery just barely makes it through a day of wearing it.  So the sleep function is now able to be used.  It dies in the middle of the night.  But that is just a gimmick. I am really disappointed.  I have tried to contact the company with no success.  The scale by Withings has the same issue with the pulse.  It will only get the pulse about 1 in 10 times.  It does connect well with my iphone.  I have tachycardia so I really wanted to have the data on my heart for my doc.  But this is not the way to do it.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I so enjoyed this book. The author took time to let you enjoy the characters instead of rushing to the end.
B00846REIS|5.0|This trilogy was great, however, beware that there is a 4th book that has not been released yet! I always wait until the entire series is out before I read any of them, because I don't like to wait on the next book to come out. I didn't realize this one wasn't complete yet. But, overall, a great read that keeps you on your toes!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|My book club selected this book, for which I am grateful as I may never otherwise have read this celebrated fantasy author. It's not that I don't like fiction, I just hadn't thought I'd be able to connect or keep up with a fantasy author's agenda. I hadn't realized there'd be something in it for every type of reader. The story has widespread appeal, with universal truisms casually peppered throughout, and the fantasy elements are easy to envision, making this an engrossing read especially for a first-time fantasy reader.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a very entertaining series. Characters make you love them or hate them. Like potatoe chips, you cant stop watching even though it is way past your bedtime!<br />I love that you get to know the main family as well as the maids and staff. They are as important to the story as the family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is sooooooo epic!You sould definitely download it!So ya, download it. By the way i have both the PE and the computer and they are tied
0156027321|5.0|The book came very quickly, and I enjoyed the book just as much as I expected to.  It was in great condition! Diane
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love it!!  Me and my wife really enjoyed the first season. We watch the entire season in less than a week..lol
B008C20TDG|5.0|No matter your reason/goal for cleaning up your food habits, this book presents compelling and well researched scientific data that will help you make informed decisions. I'd hesitated to buy this book when I first heard about it simply because its art direction is a real turn off, but don't let that stand in your way! If, like me, you prefer cleaner, nicer looking copy minus aggro callouts, buy the Kindle version (like I did) but ALSO buy the book as you'll want to share it with as many people as will read it, once you're through your Whole30!!
B000002KDS|5.0|Great Hard Rock album back when the whole band was called Alice Cooper. Bob Ezrin produced this one witch always helps, This is old school rock and deserves 5 stars. Just listen to (you drive me nervous) and you will know what the Alice Cooper Band is all about.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|This is not a technical book, so much as it is a why you design your website the way you do book.  It a good guide to web site usabilty
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I absolutely feel good purchasing this book it's so good the characters are easy to connect with the dialogue is  hilarious and the context is relatable it's a romantic  funny sad frustrating at times but you'll fall inside a world of magic lol read it you'll understand and the main girl is relatable and a honest character one if the best book I've read
B00E8B1358|1.0|I was shocked and dismayed when the main characters were killed at the beginning of the movie.  The rest of it was nonsense.  The Rock is great, but even the action of the movie was not enough to cover up the terrible plot and supporting actors.
B003YUS3JI|5.0|As a nursing student, we need to have white shoes with our scrubs...this fits my clinical work perfectly that even my classmates are asking me where I got them..they are soooooo comfortable and lightweight.....
B00C5R8364|5.0|The eerie thing about this book is that you can almost see it happen behind closed doors and the rule of law. It is a particularly compelling account in light of all the issue related to privacy and human rights.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This fan keeps my processor ice cool even if I have it Overclocked (and I do). It is totally silent and easy to install thanks to the manual. I don't see why would someone need liquid cooling with this cheap and efficient fan.<br /><br />Even in summer when the temperature is over 30ºC, this fan keeps the CPU below 50ºC (often around 40-45ºC). It is also very durable and will keep your processor cool while playing the most demanding games for long periods of time.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Unrealistic.....more crashes, killing than story!  Bruce Willis needs to hang it up as an action hero - just not worth your time to watch
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book.<br />The best hunger games book yet.<br />It is exciting and adrenalin pumping.<br />The Alliance was the best thing that happened to them in that hunger games.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|It answered questions I had but would not need or care to watch it again. Not to own only to watch once.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I REALLY was playing this a lot at first,built up lots of points and even bought coins and then My game,identity,coins etc vanished.not going to delete but won't pay again
159463176X|5.0|Having read and enjoyed Khaled Hosseini's 'Kite Runner' and a Thousand Splendid Suns' I am happy to say that his latest book \\"And the Mountains Echoed' did not disappoint.  He intertwines history, culture, bonds of family,love, devastation, separation and loss in several life stories. Knitting the stories together with heartfelt and at times raw emotion as only this author can.<br />This is a wonderful book and I recommend it highly.  Khaled Hosseini writes about LIFE, from the heart.
B000I9YXHY|3.0|I never watched this before but I've heard it's all about Barbra Barbra Barbra....and I guess that's right. She is a wonderful singer, but she takes over everything and I umm, fell asleep. The movie did not hold my attention it was just one Barbra episode after another.  I'll try it again and maybe I'll get the plot of the story next time!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I am a big Sherlock fan and even had the old radio version on old tapes. Downey is a 360 from Basil but I like his quirky ways and more modern take to the stories. Give it a try these two make a perfect combo
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Matthew McConaughey has done so much better. I found this very hard to follow, too slow and too predictable; I fell asleep.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Loved every song on this new CD.  I have listened to it over and over already.  Can't go wrong with Bon Jovi.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a very good game. Playing it for free requires patients but I don't have a lot of time for games. This is good to pick up at any time and continue.
0913866156|5.0|The deck is very nice, great size, just big enough to see all the deails that are so important in this deck, but not too big. The colours are very vivid, the card stock feels good in the hands, I use this deck more than other decks.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|The characters are amazing, the plots are so intriguing! I loved that they added Adam Baldwin, (those of you that are FireFly groupies will remember him as the doofus that worked for Captain Malcolm Reynolds). I've been waiting for 4 years for Beckett & Castle to finally get together; maybe if they do the show won't be nearly as intense!!!
B000W7FDBM|5.0|How can you go wrong with Harry Potter. My daughter read the book and then watched the movie. She loves it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the best Bond films ever made. I really enjoyed this movie. Especially with the way a certain vehicle and a few names reappear. Great plot, Javier Bardem is a great villain.
0880796863|5.0|I loved this deck, the colours so much better than usual Waite deck, no blue, but instead a light green full of meaning, well worth of its price. Also I used the box putting out the section of the booklet, wich is pretty useless to me, and I store there a pocket Crowley's deck, 2 decks in one box - very comfortable to take away.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|Not easy for anyone who know noth<br />Ing about using the ipad still waiting for someone to help teach how to ue it
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I got this as a present to my boyfriend. He had one of the metal gear games but not all of them. He's only had it a short time and has already beaten the first game. He really enjoys the series.
B003SI605K|5.0|Love this story! It reminds me of how hard our ancestors had to work to be accepted in this society and how each one of us has our culture weaved in our soul.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This book was very well written with substantial historical references to make the story even more valid.  I recommend this book to all!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I've had this case for a little over a month and it works great with the Kindle Fire. Snug fit and stylish.
0316201545|5.0|I bought the first Land of Stories, for my 8yr old son & he couldnt put it down, he was so excited about it. I also read it & it was so well written & so enthralling. So when i saw that another book was coming out, I knew that i had to buy it & we were not disappointed, same level of excitement & intriguing (& very hilarious) story line & what is most important its a great book for kids. As long as there are more books to come out, i will be buying them :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wonderful love this game!! I play it all the time I would highly recommend it for anyone. All ages.. it's wonderful!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved this show!  I would recommend it to friends.  Beautiful setting and costumes...plus I love hearing the accent.  So glad I found it!
1451695195|5.0|Dealing with the loss of my younger sister.  It helped me keepmy faith and strenghten it after reading the book.
B00B52F278|5.0|We just started watching this season last night.  I hate that this will be the last of this, but all good things must come to an end.  Better it end being on top, then waiting until everyone was bored with it.  This was one amazing series!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game has drawn my boys and I in. Its a rush every morning to check to see how much our dragons made and to see if we hatched any new ones. You can buy coins or gems with real cash but its not nessecary. you can earn everything you need while playing, you can even make rare dragons that you wouldnt think you could get without buying them. Its so addicting I even got my sister to play. The only issue with it is that sometimes it glitches  and you have to exit or restart while playing. It doesnt affect what you were doing and you dont loose coins or anything. It's just annoying, but otherwise its a GREAT game.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I like the Lincoln Lawyer series.  This was an interesting story, however, I found the ending to be disappointing.  I don't want to spoil the story for others, but I felt no closure to the story.  This could have been on purpose to continue in another book.  I will still read M. Connelly books.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I am a huge fan of the show bones and season 7 did not disappoint me. However the dvd you sent me was unsatisfactory. When I first received it I was very excited so I put it in right away, only to find that the first two episodes (which are the most important episodes in a tv series) did not work at all. This was a major let down. you should test your products before you sell them. I was aware that it was used, but there was no indicator saying how poor the quality of the dvd was all that was said about was that there was a small nick in the disc. If there was only a small nick it should've worked just fine, which it did not.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Nice beach book. Fast and lots of secrets to figure out.<br />This is a great book club book,a lot to disagree about.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Short of watching the news, this app is great for the average user. From the look of things it will only get better in time. The features that it offers is just what i need without all of the complications.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|This box set is essential for any fan of The Band.<br /><br />It collects the released performances from \\"Rock Of Ages\\" 1972 album and 2001 reissue on Discs 1 & 2.  These are the same takes from those titles, but newly remixed by Robbie Robertson and Bob Clearmountain.  For the original mix of \\"Rock Of Ages\\", Mobile Fidelity's SACD is the absolute best option.  But this box set's remixes offer much improved sound over the original mix, as great as it was.  The difference in sound is comparable to the original \\"Last Waltz\\" issue vs. the remixed 2002 box set.  So basically, the soundstage is way wider and spread out, the instruments are all clearer and more dynamic, and the Clearmountain mixes attempt to present the takes in the best sound quality updated technology can provide.<br /><br />The complete New Year's Eve show, as mixed by Sebastian Robertson, is on Discs 3 & 4.  This mix is different from Clearmountain's: instead of a super polished mix, the sound is raw, immediate and without any unneccesary tricks or frills.  Clear and well mixed vocals, thick and supple drums/bass, piano and guitar left/right, and organ left and center.  It is a wonderful mix to hear this show like you're in the audience and the soundmen are doing a fantastic job.  Also note that this complete New Year's Eve show does repeat some songs from the first two discs.  Those takes were selected as the \\"best\\" of the run, and of course they would also appear in their proper place in the original show.  BUT, contrary to what many people are thinking, the New Year's Eve show only has 7 repeated/previously released tracks (not including Dylan).<br /><br />Both mixes have a more natural, balanced mix of the horn section, which was a common complaint from some over the years.  The hardcover book fits perfectly with [[ASIN:B000B19B6M A Musical History (W/DVD)]], featuring a beautiful collection of photos throughout 48 pages.  The DVD contains footage of two tracks: \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\\" and \\"The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\".  The video of \\"Don't Do It\\" is found on MUSICAL HISTORY, for a total of 3 video tracks from these shows.  All of these elements combine to make this an absolutely essential release for true fans of THE BAND!
B00D5CENXA|3.0|This short story is a tale of animal heroism. Before her ex-husband George was sent to prison for beating her, Annie lived in constant fear of George's brutality. The time he spends behind bars gives Annie a much-needed respite to foster her relationships with her longtime friends: Rob, a local veterinarian, and Czar, her favorite stallion. Things take a sinister turn when George goes free and stalks Annie, catching her by surprise at her home. Czar selflessly defends Annie against her abusive ex-husband, and dispenses swift, wild, animal justice to save her life.<br /><br />This short story is definitely a good read for animal lovers, people who like the great outdoors, and just about anyone who can appreciate a good short story.
0399255370|5.0|We bought two copies for two little girls.  They are Christmas presents, so they have not gotten them yet, but we read the books.  My wife is a guidance counselor in a preK/kindergaren center and it is perfect for the kids at that age.  Well worth the money.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|The first time I read this book was probably around 20 years ago or so.  And throughout the years, I thought about this book, since I lost it when I moved out of my parents' home.  I was glad to find it online and especially in Kindle.  I felt a huge desire to read this book for a second time, and enjoyed it as if it was my first time reading it.  This is a very touching book and I this is definitely a book I would recommend to anyone.  It really makes you see things and life from a different perspective.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|I was really happy to see this film on Amazon prime.  Don't ask me why, but I think Ben Stiller is hilarious in it!
B00BT70J7M|5.0|I've listened to the CD twice and I am very impressed with the beauty of the singing and the quality of the interpretation.  The &#34;Celeste Aida&#34; alone is worth the cost of purchase.  This is not just for fans of Mr. Kaufmann.
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|I like the stories and examples on negotiating. The ideas can be quickly implemented in your communications with customers, vendors, and anyone you need to influence.
0071359168|4.0|I will merely echo the sentiments of many who have already stated this is a must read for anyone charged with marketing anything.
B00455IVHU|5.0|One of my favorite Barbra Streisand movies.  I always enjoy this film.  Jeff Bridges is also great in this film.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Having just completed watching the anime High School of the Dead the day before seeing this, the comparisons were striking; I much preferred HOTD.  Yes, the production values and effects in WWZ are very impressive (loved the piled up ant-like scenes) but sadly I felt something missing.. probably the historical visceral, grisly, nature of R rated zombie apocalypse films.  This was a PG-13 fare and rarely lingered on the 'horror in the trenches', panning away before too much gore is shown.  Not to say it was 'bad' film, just didn't grip me like some of the prior entries to this genre.  Seemed too sanitized, laugh; one doesn't really grasp the gravity of the situation.  Quick take: Brad Pitt whisks his family away to safety while he endeavors to find the root cause of the current zombie apocalypse.  A good popcorn film/rental, but I wouldn't splurge to own it. 3.5/5 for effects.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book was extremely engrossing and very hard to put down.  It held my interest from the beginning to the very end.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I approve of this Star Trek remake.  Really great casting and story line. JJ is the best director.  A must see.
B00BRUQ3PS|1.0|I'm a big fan of Oryx and Crake but I barely made it through this book.  There are two plot lines, the more prominent of which is boring, awkward to read, and tangential to what interested me about this series.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|Very cool and well detailed....just will NOT stand up on his own.No problem though....going to mount him on a small display base.Looks like Amazon might yank this item( due to the &#34;meth&#34;)
B0081336FO|5.0|I've been looking for another good drama to spend some time with since many of my favs are long gone and I haven't succumbed to Downton, Breaking Bad, Revenge, et al. Great story lines and well drawn characters. And you just can't beat British sensibilities for entertainment value. Can't wait for season 3.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Slow boring movie - and the download performance from Amazon was terrible.  Movie pixelated terribly and stalled 6 times.<br />Would not recommend to anyone.
6305736650|1.0|I was advertised as colorized.  When I arrived, it was not.  It was not what I ordered and was a waste of my money
1478951508|1.0|We were warned that it was an adult book but most adults do not want to hear or read something that has the F word over and over throughout the whole book!  Totally unnecessary.  My husband would not even listen the the CDs.  We only got two CDs in and put it away - unable to finish it.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|This movie would be awesome if not viewed under terrible streaming quality.  I will be talking with Amazon about getting a refund for the movie because my wife and I could not even stand to watch the terrible pixelated quality that it streamed in.
B002APU580|5.0|The dialogue followed the book very closely. What a joy to meet the characters, just as they were portrayed. Sometimes the music was so loud, dialogue was muffled.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the most fun app I have ever had/played it is really cool and it was the first time I ever got a app on my Kindle
B0012NO316|3.0|Very good acting by Liz and Dick but the plot was pretty disturbing. A classic and worth watching, but definitely not upbeat.
B00CTT9646|3.0|Like the previous Amazon Star Trek movie collectors edition, this was a bit expensive.  You can get the 3D Blu-ray movie from BB for under $20, so the replica Phaser cost $60.  The replica is life size and has some heft, but has no electronics or moving parts except the rotating barrel.  Also, it is resin with perhaps some metal cladding or metallic paint on the phaser tip.  It comes with an acrylic stand for display.  It's not meant to be a toy, but it would have been nice to have some real moving parts or electronics for that price point.<br /><br />As some reviews have mentioned, the replicas may be defective or have flaws, so it's best to open and check yours.  The only problem with my phaser was the spinning of the stun/kill barrel.  It was some what tight.  Other than that, pretty flawless.  If you didn't preorder this, they're already sold out so you probably can only get one thru secondary market.  They did claim it was limited.  It would get more stars if it was made better with some parts that worked.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this app way too much!  love it, easy, fun,  totally addicting. you will love it too and its free what more could you wantt?

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I have never had to stop reading a book and stop reading it again! After the secret was revealed at the half way done marker,the went downhill! A total waste of time and money!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I had never watched SOA before this, but now I am hooked..can't believe I waited this long to jump on the bandwagon!!
B00514HDNW|2.0|Considering all the raves and low price, what could I lose by giving it a try even though I never get excited about vampire stories. Is this the best they got? The writing was weak in character development, inventiveness, plot and action. Very repetitive. Yes, he's angry being the last human in town. I got it the first time. Didn't need any reminding. Yikes! Give it another star if you are into vampire stories, not that this is much of a story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app, I am addicted to it. After using it I can't imagine not using it everyday. You make boards and pin pins, and its just time consuming and wonderful. You. an find amazing recipes and crafts to do with your kids or to decorate your home. There are also funny pics and there are inspirational quotes. It has everything and that's why I love it so much. The End !!!!!
1451695195|2.0|This book is one of many NDE (Near Death Experience) bestsellers in the recent past, including: Heaven Is For Real, 90 Minutes In Heaven, The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, and, how can we forget, Sylvia Browne's Life on the Other Side: A Psychic's Tour of the Afterlife (this last one is a joke, but only half mine). `Heaven' in the title of Proof Of Heaven isn't the traditional concept of heaven, and it isn't a traditional Christian message, which might lend it more credibility since it isn't as predictable. In the end, I always think the real-life stories that alternate in these books with the NDE vision are often as interesting, or more so, than the `visit' to the after-life.<br /><br />NDE's are fascinating as psychological, not necessarily preternatural, events; and they are especially interesting as poetic/artistic language expressing a person's deepest desires and darkest fears (\\"They should have sent a poet!\\"-- [...] I only have minor doubts from time to time about the complete honesty and veracity of these accounts. As we all know, when you're using words for something that is `beyond explanation', like most of reality, it's easy to embellish, exaggerate, offer post factum interpretation, and otherwise explain and apply rather than tell. In other words (see, I do it too), if it don't fit, you MAKE it fit. Into the brain, that is.<br /><br />Now, I'll be honest, the nagging thought has fluttered against me many times that Dr. Alexander is fabricating a lot of his NDE because he wants to comfort people with something `tangible' they can hold on to when they lose loved ones. I wouldn't go so far as to say he'd make it all up to sell a book, but... that is how religions are born. For the record, I think he's being honest, but I know too well the meaning of Nietzsche's words, \\"He who does not know how to tell a lie, does not know what the truth is\\" to think that it is not beyond any man--who, like in the case of Alexander, clearly wants to give others hope beyondthis life--to fudge on a few details, or artificially tie up loose ends to make the story more `tell-able'. This is actually a fairly normal practice when it comes to retelling one's dreams, and is known in psychoanalysis as \\"secondary revision.\\"<br /><br />As far as having a credible, reputable, sane person write their story of something nearly unbelievable that happened to them, you couldn't have picked someone better than Dr. Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon with lots of experience. He has taught at Duke University Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, University of Massachusetts Medical School, and the University of Virginia Medical School. He was a former agnostic, and skeptic with regard to NDE's. When he speaks, people listen. Including Oprah, may she live forever.<br /><br />The `proof' from his title comes from the fact that he truly believes the E. coli bacteria that caused his meningitis shut down most of his brain, especially the parts that could have enabled him to have dreams or thinking of any kind. He states, \\"My doctors have told me that according to all the brain tests they were doing, there was no way that any of the functions including vision, hearing, emotion, memory, language, or logic could possibly have been intact.\\" This becomes the lynchpin for his assertion that \\"true thought is pre-physical\\", and consciousness transcends the brain and is not reliant on it. His evidence is more anecdotal here, but he is very, very passionate about stating this belief. Almost too passionate, maybe even desperate. Do you ever get that feeling that someone is trying to convince themselves more than you? But, then again, it's hard to dismiss his plea for understanding when he alleges that he believes this experience was as real, and as dear to his heart, as anything in this terrestrial plane, including, I'm assuming, his love for his wife and children.<br /><br />But here's the crux of the whole tale: \\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever. You have nothing to fear. There is nothing you can do wrong.\\" And, \\"All is well.\\" Now, who can possibly have a problem with that takeaway? He says \\"Love is the basis of everything...it is the reality of realities.\\" Yes. If people could really believe that, there'd probably be less problems in the world. Imagine if people truly realized they were part of it all, and harm/good done to another is harm/good done to one's self. And, for what it's worth, the new world that entertained Alexander's in his vision/dream/experience was beautiful, if a little boring sounding at time for personalities like mine. Now, for those looking for rest from a life they've found to be fatiguing and jading, in this `heaven' they would be able to sleep well for millennia. The other pros to this kind of story being told: Alexander's family says that he is more `present' now with them than he has ever been, he encourages people with his story to believe that there is hope and the best is yet to come, and his foundation/organization at Eternea.org seems to want to encourage dialogue and critical thought in and between religious-scientific communities. He wants to use his story to do some good in the world. And maybe start a new religion. Which sort-of concerns me. But...other than that...<br /><br />Not as a rebuttal to Alexander's testimony, though it may unhinge some of his conclusions about his experience, I have assembled a narrative comparison between statements in Alexander's book, and Christopher Bache's Dark Night, Early Dawn, a work about trans-personal psychology and non-ordinary states of consciousness. Bache describes experiences in states responsibly and safely induced by psychedelics, NDE's, and meditative practices; and the comparisons between some of his personal accounts in the book which he achieved by the use of psychedelics, and Alexander's account are extraordinary. This, I believe, serves to illustrate that a person need not be brain-dead or literally `out of body' to experience an ecstatic, revelatory `journey' which provides sensory-cognitive stimulation that feels very, very real and profound. See the Narrative Comparison at the end of my full review posted at: [...]<br /><br />I truly believe we all need a sense of our connectedness and indispensability in the cosmos, to feel loved \\"dearly and forever\\"; and this book, I'm sure, provides that for many. However, I think that message is available to us in many different manifestations. It would be a pity if the only way to feel a `part of it all' and really be presently mindful and joyful in life would be to die and see the afterlife, or read a book about someone who did. Also, there still is the matter of faith and self-affirmation that we need to help us appreciate the opportunity that life is and every moment in it. Do we loathe our lives, our selves, so much that we're so anxious to cash it in for what comes next? It sounds so ungrateful. According to every religion, isn't there a reason we're here in the first place? And as far as pure materialism goes, there's nowhere else to be! Let's not blow it, or one day we'll be looking back regretting we wasted it wishing we were somewhere else.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series...PBS series are always very well done and and this one is no exception. Everyone needs to watch
B007B6T3K4|4.0|I had never listened to Xandria or even this musical niche before but I find the music both highly enjoyable & inspiring.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I bought this app for the spreadsheet. I am an accountant and keep track of everything on my computer spreadsheets. I wanted something I could use when I travel. Once I figured out the basics I love it. I am just using it for very basic functions, but it is working for what I intended.
0061537969|5.0|I thought this was going to be a tear jerker, but it was SO much more!!  You HAVE to read this one. .
B00CMB8MXC|5.0|Despicable Me 2 soundtrack is as fun to listen to as the movie was to watch. Especially the Minions version of Y.M.C.A.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had to know what was going to happen next, at all times while reading. It w was a really good.
0824835921|5.0|Admittedly, I'm only 50 characters in, but I've got the character list in front of me, and of the ones I've learned in the last two days, I remember them well enough to make a En/Jp 'meanings' list just based on the characters. I have a good memory, but learning the Kana has taken me the last 3 weeks of spending about an hour every day drilling them, and that's only 2-48 character sets. So. The system this author uses is very well worth it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone learning Japanese, and I recommend starting at the beginning of your journey to fluency. Don't put off Kanji because you think it's too hard. You probably have a vocabulary of at least 10,000 words or so, and when you put a number on it, it sounds intimidating, but in reality it's nothing when you only tackle 20 or so per day.<br /><br />One slight note of caution: Volume 1 starts you at English meanings, and each kanji can sometimes have a different meaning than the author gives for the 'keyword', and sometimes the 'keyword' he gives isn't sensible to the individual. For example, he lists 71 as 'decameron'. Most English speakers (I have a pretty big vocabulary) don't know what that means. I had to look it up. I wrote '10-day season', because it can mean a 10-day period of time, or a season. Looking up the meaning and usage for each kanji with jisho.org would be extremely helpful, not necessarily because the author's wrong in his meanings, but that you might have a keyword that you're going to remember better. Plus, some of the stories he has don't make too much sense, so again, it is helpful to put it in your own words. Doing this uses the author's method exactly: Using imaginative memory rather than blind memorization. It's a lot easier to remember that a village is rice paddies to be counted than just pairing the symbol with the word village. It allows you to make it fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book is written very well. Love the fact that you can escape the real world for a little while and experience the world of a Anastasia and Christian. Definitely never a dull moment lol.
B00A285OOW|4.0|THIS BOOK MAKES HISTORY COME ALIVE , WITH REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL PROBLEMS. THE ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEM S ARE NOT ALWAYS HAPPY, OR WHAT I WOULD CHOOSE BUT REAL.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I loved this game. Took me a while but I finally beat the last level. The people rating it low after only a few levels should try it again. The first levels are very easy but it takes a logical mind to figure out higher levels. I'm glad I kept going. Definitely worth 99 cents if you didn't get it free.
B0067R0APK|2.0|Is more difficult to navigate features and load images from satellite. I prefer the original Accu Weather app was more user friendly.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! It's a wonderful mix of drama and history that gives us an idea of what life was like after the war and how the war became a vehicle for social change.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Feel author was overly biased in his view of Jesus as strictly one in a line of Jewish Zealots. Interesting concept.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This too was well written and kept you on the edge of you seat all through the book.<br />I could not put it down.
0345440900|5.0|Must read for every new Mom & Grandma to be.  Wish I read it before my grandson was born.  Entertaining and Informative.  Loved it!  Great Gift.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Fast paced and exciting, this movie was very enjoyable.  The special effects were spectacular.  The past, present, and future were depicted working together.
B003NTSBUG|1.0|This movie is so awful! How could actors such as Ben Kingsley, DiCaprio, Von Sydow stoop to this! I only bought it for Emily Mortimer who did her lousy part OK. Worst money ever spent on a film.
B0040I09RM|3.0|It seems to get better the more you watch but the acting lacks at certain critical points that brings down my rating
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|It was an awesome series. I was sad to see it end. I hope maybe something more can come ...maybe from a different angle.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I was hoping for something that would make it easier to use and access youtube on the Kindle<br /> but this wasn't very successful in providing much help.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have used this product for a few months.  It has performed exactly as expected.  The battery alert at 15% remaining has really been valuable.<br /><br />.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app easy to use large buttons. has all the functions I need in a calculator. I would rexcomend to amyone
0440246318|4.0|I have read all tghe Reacher series and enjoy them emensely.  Lee Child always builds in some twists and turns, along with some believable characters.
1416595236|5.0|I had a very hard time reading this book knowing it was the last book.  As always, it was full of twists & turns.  It's great knowing that there really are great Americans like Mitch Rapp doing all they can to keep us safe!!!  Vince Flynn is sorely missed.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife deserves all of the recognition it's received! Great writing, acting, stories and production. We can't stop watching!
B0030SZ2D4|5.0|Sure, the movie is more or less and unplanned &#34;Bug Hunt&#34; on a desolate planet, but the interpersonal dynamics are handled well, the situations are set up nicely and the quality of the special effects elevates this movie head and shoulders over almost anything else in the genre but &#34;Alien&#34;.  Of course this movie owes much to the &#34;Alien&#34; series. In turn, &#34;Alien&#34; derived a lot of plot elements and visuals from an obscure Italian movie &#34;Planet Of The Vampires&#34;.<br /><br />In general, the  characters make the right or best choices and still die sometimes. Their actions are usually logical, or at least reasonable in light of their personalities and the situation as they understand it. I hope Vin Diesel had one tenth as much fun making this movie and the other two &#34;Riddick&#34; movies as I did in watching this one. Strong acting all round!
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Eddie Murphy is hilarious in this movie.  Ben Stiller is on point as his accomplice.  These two are so funny together it makes one wonder why they didn't team up in other movies.  Very funny!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Cool game fun to play but slow waiting for energy wish you could buy stuff with coins instead of using diamonds
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Love it! One of the best magic movies I ever watched. It was great, the best, spetectular, magically, & exciting.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Sorry gang I had to pass on this one. I made it a little more than half way through and had to drop it. Sure don't want my review to ruin anyone else's chances of enjoying it but I just found it rather boring. Not enough action and mostly revolves around living in the confines of a giant silo. Good luck to anyone else who decides to read it.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie is cleverly done ... Owen Wilson is very believable as the lead character.  (His girlfriend is not so good in this one ... somebody else should have played her part.)  The rest of the cast is wonderful.  Great scenery too!
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|It's excellent !!! It truly reveals who He is now our lives now. Bought 6 already to give out as gifts.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This isn't an android mini PC. This isn't like anything you've used before. Even after having used it, it's difficult for me to describe what it is. ... So, plug it into your TV, go through the awkward setup instructions, preferably through the Apple or Android app available for free, then see the two default services available for \\"casting\\" programs to your TV: Youtube and Netflix. These \\"apps\\" both work really well. So enjoy your first day's watching, then tomorrow when you try to watch again expect a puzzling time gap while the system sorts itself out again, then watch some more. You won't get \\"app\\" access just yet for Hulu or Amazon, but I hear and I hope that those apps are coming soon. BUT - if you download the Chrome browser to your PC or Mac, find the also-free Chromecast add-on in the Google store and install it, then go to Hulu and hit the \\"cast\\" button (look around for it in the Chrome tab, on the right side), you might find you have enough bandwidth in your wifi setup to broadcast shows backward (don't know how else to describe it) to your TV. Now here's where the quality and capability of your router comes in. To get a good picture, since your asking your router to have traffic going both ways at the same time, 300mbps is minimum for a good experience on Hulu and necessary for Amazon Instant Video; 150mbps won't be enough to even pull up a shoddy picture on Amazon. ... Firmware updates and more app services will imporve the operation and usability of this device greatly, so overall I think it's worth having (particularly at this price). But it's best not to expect great things from the Chromecast right now.
160774273X|4.0|Great book with insightful technique.<br />It has plenty of recipe to make a variety of great breads.  This book is a classic reference for any baker for years to come.
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|This movie is hilarious ... especially the scene where the vinyl record flies out of the record jacket.  Love this movie!
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|A terrific series.  Can hardly wait for season three.  Watching on discs is a great way to see it at one's own time and pace.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Well written and easy to read. My husband and I both followed the diet together. Highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I  had to listen  more than once for the album to grow on me.  What a  fantastic  release.  High  energy  and  fun.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|An amazing adaptation to the My Little Pony universe. Princess Twilight Sparkle finds herself immersed in her most challenging test yet.. High School. When her crown is stolen by Sunset Shimmer it's up to Twilight Sparkle to get it back. Traversing into the human realm through the magical and mystical looking glass, Twilight Sparkle finds herself in a new body and must adapt quickly while gaining popularity to win her crown. Just about everypony gets a new look in this stunning feature length film featuring memorable songs and great moments that stick to the qualities of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series. Fans will certainly love it as I have and with the Blu-Ray copy you get added features and outstanding quality. This is a must buy for any fan and a great addition to any movie collector.
B00441GYZQ|1.0|Did you ever see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? I want everyone who rated this five stars to give me a dollar so I can wipe this film from my memory. I saw it in theaters for free and walked out and demanded my money back. Great flick for making out, as no one will say \\"I'm trying to watch the movie!\\"
B00CX7OW1G|1.0|I wouldn't know how to start ,as this movie ,has no beginning ,no end, no plot.<br />A fragmented scenes  with hardly a full conversation.<br />Olga kurylenko is beautiful and so is Rachel McAdams nothing more.<br />Ben Afleck doesn't speak more than 2 full sentences in this movie .<br />Bits me if a woman ,Olga, is so in love that needs leave her home land and her daughter to meet and stay with her lover ,jumps into bed with a total stranger  !!!!!!!!....<br />Don't spend a dime buying this film rather buy an ice cream.<br />I would  rate this as half a star
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|This app sucks!  It did not increase the volume at all. I  tried everything and the volume remained the same if not worse. I deleted this crap!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great heartwarming story! The more I read the harder it was to put down! The ending is a little predictable , but loved it all the same!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|In general I really like the pulse. The step count seems accurate, the pulse is easy to use and also seems accurate. I like the sleep behavior information although I would like to be able to do more with it. I don't know how it determines what light and deep sleep is. If it is taking my pulse during the night, I would like to see that data. In conjunction with my withings scale, I have lost 40 pounds in 8 months. I am also using myfitnesspal to track calories which is supposed to sync with withings and I have attached it to my account but I don't see any calorie info in the dashboard and only a few weight readings from my scale in myfitnesspal. Also myfitnesspal is difficult to use in that it doesn't allow you to mark a food as a favorite, so many times I have to type in the food again in the search. However, it does have a large database of food and I haven't had any trouble finding the foods that I have eaten. Myfitnesspal does make it easy to scan barcodes however.<br /><br />The battery life is very good. Usually more than a week per charge.<br /><br />The elevation measure of the pulse is terrible. It counted elevation in an elevator when I was standing completely still. It isn't supposed to do that as per their website. In general, it will say I have traversed 50+ feet elevation in a day when I doubt it has been more than 10. I have read on forums that withings might be coming out with an update to fix it. I hope so because I can't trust the calories burned number if the elevation isn't correct.<br /><br />In general, I would recommend the pulse.
B00F35BV64|2.0|I liked the first in the new series of \\"Star Trek\\" movies (2009) enough to purchase the film.  I waited until Amazon and Vudu (who always copy each other exactly and instantaneously) allowed for renting this new one rather than requiring purchase from the cloud.<br /><br />So glad I did.  This is one boring movie.  Benedict Cumberback, who was so great in the BBC \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" series, is completely wasted here.  The ending is completely derivative.  In fact, the whole movie is.  I think it is high time for \\"Star Trek\\" to finally RIP -- and no further infusions of super-modified DNA are necessary -- we all know the plot.  It has just grown so old.  I cannot believe that the originals (such as Leonard Nimoy) who are still alive are anything other than embarrassed by this boring stuff.  Six bucks is all they get from me.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I enjoyed Fey's quirky, refreshing writing style.  She revealed her biography in traditional chronological order but kept it interesting with the occasional back step, side step, over step of anecdotal stories.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|I got interested in The Good Wife during Season 3 and I always had questions about certain things. I am so glad this came to Amazon Prime so I could get caught up. With Amazon Prime, I can watch on my Kindle Fire HD with virtually no buffering issues and I love that it is commercial free.
B00116FT6M|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  It makes me very happy.  I watch it at least once a year.
B002VISNLC|5.0|Includes all of the original line drawings, making for the complete Dahl experience. Written to be read out aloud, and to scare young children senseless at bedtime, I only wish Roald Dahl Had included,  in the list of ways that women hide in normal society, MOTHERS! Goodness always prevails in Dahl's stories and the child protagonist, always victorious, has strengths and virtues all children aspire to.
B00DSTBMMU|3.0|It could have been a whole lot better if they would have not been so stingy with pedal steel, fiddles, and harmony singers on almost EVERY song. The producer and sound engineers seemed to have done their best to get the country OUT of this record, in spite of Sheryl's nice country sounding vocals on most songs (several of the songs were non country and very much in the standard Sheryl Crow genre). A good example of that would be 'We Oughta Be Drinking' even with Whiskey River, Nashville, and country song references, it is slow and can't find a direction. This is a case of less was less.  If it is gonna be country, make it sound undeniable, ok? I am disappointed but, a remix could have fixed almost ALL of the problems here.. That said several tracks were very good productions as they stood and deserve honorable mention. 'Callin' Me When I'm Lonely' &#34;Waterproof Mascara' were pretty nice as they stood. Remixing would have saved 'Crazy Ain't Original' and made it the anthem it tried to be. 'Nobody's Business' was way to close to Bad Company material that will remain unnamed but I am SURE will draw instant parallels in your mind. All of this stuff considered, Sheryl's vocals are sound and if she tries again with a better production like 'Heart of Texas Records', she could get it right.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|After reading this book, i come to the conclusion that Kahneman hasn't won the nobel prize aword only for being smart and groundbeaking, but also a glorios writer!<br />the book is about the human cognetive errors, and is full with exampels and personal stories that teaches not only the end result but also the road and the state of mind that kahneman was when he developed his oppinion.<br />There are three main issues: the 2 system person, the results of the wrong assumption about the human charecter in economic science(ECON VS HUMAN), and the two ways of measurment of happines that conflicts.<br /><br />a must read for every person that wants self improvment, advertisment industry and practikly evryone must know the efiphnies of his book

B008XG1X18|5.0|I've heard sarcastic remarks about the dream/wish boards people pin but in my humble opinion pinterest is saving the worlds trees, since we're not tearing out magazine pages to scrapbook our lives with in dream/wish books anymore. I love it!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|A somewhat simplistic but obviously a sensible approach to solving difficulties that arise in long term relationships.  Some suggestions for specific actions to be taken are not realistic but the general idea of different &#34;languages&#34; for expressing love is convincing

B00DQR26EC|5.0|Great RPG. Best I have found on any app store. A must buy for any RPG fan. HOURS of gameplay for two dollars.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|That a Queensryche minus Tate and Degarmo would be capable of producing this masterpiece ? As this Band has let me down time and again in recent years, I was hesitant to leap on to the bandwagon of gushing praise that this album was receiving. I bought the album when it was released but took my time in digesting it, I can now say that this album is rivaling Operation Mindcrime as my favorite Ryche album to date. All I can say is that the last 15 years, barring Tribe, since Degarmo left and Tate took over as bandleader must have been hell for Wilton, Jackson and Rockenfield if they can put together an album this good within a year of Tate being fired. Geoff Tate and the terrible Frequency Unknown album should realize the band is what makes the sound, not the vocalist, as Latorre sounds better and writes better lyrics. The Ryche sound is absent from Frequency Unknown. The new Queensryche album is an easy 5 out of 5 stars and that is from a fan since 1984`s Warning.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Although the theme prevalent in this book may seem very familiar to some successful people, it is a good guide for those who think that all you need are good connections and a lot of luck.  This book should be required reading in High school.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|The actors are very good with comedy, though most of this movie for teens & up- due to subject matter. Very little sex situations, if any. This movie shows what some people would love to do with their employers, but illegally.

B00BWBHIUG|1.0|At first it was a great little game for free and addictive.  The push to purchase pearls to progress was evident but with patience & time one can build a reef.  As time passed the goal of this little freebee is how to get you to buy, buy, buy.  90% of treasure chests cost you more than you spent, evey task wants you to use your resources for no gain, and the final disappointment is now my game is non-functional. The lesson to learn here is not about how a reef and fish interact, but how much money the developers can dupe you out of before the game crashes.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Not new but good. It doesn't really have any scratches and it works just fine for me. I would by from here more often.

B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This book did not work for me. I found nothing magical, no enticing plot, no characters that I cared about.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This was a quick and informative read. While similar to the 1945 movie starring James Dunn and Dorothy McGuire, there were more elements to the story and descriptions of life in Brooklyn at the turn of the century, giving the reader an insight into that time frame.

1582701709|4.0|From the place I stand in right now, this is an average book. There are many, many books that explore the idea of \\"attraction\\" in greater details. But, obviously, \\"The Secret\\" is the first book that I've read on the subject. This is the book that inspired me to learn more about the idea of the Law of Attraction.<br /><br />Because it inspired me to seek more, this is the book, thanks to which I'm a successful writer and owner of my own company today. Without \\"The Secret\\" - a small, general and well-marketed book, I wouldn't be able to say that I live a happy life.<br /><br />For me, it's the best review I can give to this book.

It's written &#34;straight to the point&#34;  and in an easily understood way giving the reader a sense of hope in the down times and suggestions for encouragement on the way back up.  He uses his own life's experiences, with humor thrown in, and formulates guidelines for the reader to use to get started and maintain the climb back to successful endeavors.

B0095MVOMC|4.0|I enjoyed this game purely because it reminds us to use our powers of observation to look behind the obvious.  Most numbers where quite easily found, but the last couple in each scene really get you looking. I played the game straight through, seeking to improve &#34;my eye&#34;, and was quite disappointed when I ran out of scenes.

030746363X|5.0|You should read everything by Tim Ferriss. Not because you will necessarily lose 20lbs in a month or only have to work 4 hrs a week - but because Tim thinks outside the boring. He makes us feel that there is more to life than sitting on our fat arse complaining about our choices. Too fat? Eat differently. Hate your job? Take the leap. This book is full of the usual mix of scientific know how and downright lunacy. Good job Tim.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a good game so please get it and rate minion rush five stars max thank you .=)
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A very simple concept, match two identical cubes to clear them, till you have no cubes left. The game may be played against the clock for 1 or 5 minutes, to totally clear your cubes, or in reverse, where the game adds cubes, a few at a time until the cube is complete. In these games the cube may be rotated so you can see all 6 faces.  The last game is a stationary view of the cube, it cannot be rotated, with again the object being to clear all the cubes.  I am obsessed with trying to improve my times.  My only slight negative is that the stationary cube game does not have a timer on it.  I think the next version should. Plays beautifully on Kindle Fire HD, haven't found any problems.

0525478817|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars is well-written and intelligent.  I especially appreciated the portrayal of two teenagers who embrace the beauty of language and think deeply about their circumstances. The dialogue between Hazel and Augustus is rich and often humorous.  The depiction of the cruelty of cancer is realistic and heartbreaking, yet the book never becomes maudlin.  I had one problem with the book, however.  The author doesn't seem to have any sense of how time zones work.  This mistake really irked me.  I suppose it is a small matter in an otherwise excellent book, but I had a hard time getting past it.

B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This product is really useful and functional... everything I expected and more. But you need to understand and adapt to its design. First of all, it really is small. That is both good and bad. It is so easy to forget that you have it with you and easy to (potentially) lose it. A wristband is included that is very lightweight for exercise and sleep but I am concerned about the long-term durability of this strap. You need to be cognizant of the product every day to ensure you are recording and securing its use.<br /><br />Otherwise the device, its connectivity and associated software are first-rate in every way. It is difficult to assess its accuracy it but it really helps one to focus on your lifestyle. I am sure there are improvements on the way but it shows the way forward in personal health management.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this product, the company and its vision.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Pretty good puzzle game.  Not as good as Sudoku but not the app's fault.  Only complaint is I wish the pencil button was closer to the numbers, it's a big stretch going for it all the time
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This game is fun but hard there's a way to buy the other ones I don't care if some of the maps cost you can pay for them<br /><br />You guess that spent your money on this game are kinda dum  dont you know that a lot of games become free da.

B003XE1DR4|3.0|I have the exact same pair already so I thought I knew my size and ordered a replacement for them. This new pair is far too small and the back strap cuts off my circulation and rubs on my skin so that it gave me a blister.  I've tried to stretch the strap out but it hasn't worked yet.  This makes these shoes very uncomfortable to wear.  GET THE SIZING RIGHT!!!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|One her  best so far.  And the video is AWESOME! I can only imagine how good the album will be.
1476712042|3.0|I just finished this book and my kindle app informed me of a 'sequel', so after realizing its the same story from Travis's view, I am reflecting on how much did I really like this book?  I found it very engaging (read it in less than 2 days) but I must admit that the push and pull nature of the characters relationship started to ware thin by 3/4 the way through...and then there is the violent outbursts, copious casual sex, and a dependence on alcohol to cope.  I understand that authors often use these devices to create a feeling of 'passion' and 'intensity' but this feels a little contrived and off putting.  I will give buying the 'sequel' some more thought and decide if I really want to revisit his story...
B0010SEMP0|5.0|a very fun read! i love this series and cant wait to read the next one! im so glad they have it as an ebook because i hate not finding the paperbacks at the bookstore.

B00B0CU2CI|4.0|This is a good book for people like me who do not know much about Canada. Though the book has a grim and serious storyline, the author's narration is really good. Especially the time he described about his childhood. And also the way he described relationships in the plot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of my very favorite books that I have read. It keeps you intrigued and eager to keep reading no matter how late it is! A lot of sleep was lost while reading this book. It was well written as well as amazingly suspenseful and entertaining. Good job!
B0001V01BG|5.0|Brian Cohen is a Jew and, born under a wandering star, it seems he is destined to be mistaken, from the manger to the grave, for The Messiah. It also turns out that, courtesy of his mother's liason with a gentleman by the name of Nortius Maximus, he is a Woman. Sorry, a Roman. Still, you've got to look on the bright side, haven't you?<br /><br />LoB is, without any question, the best thing that the Pythons ever did. Their [[ASIN:B008H120CU TV sketch]] series has aged badly, [[ASIN:B0001V01BQ Monty Python And The Holy Grail]] was an epic Arthurian comedy-drama badly let down by a lame-duck ending, and [[ASIN:B0001WAGHO The Meaning of Life]] was a silver-screen mish-mash of loosely connected sketches of varying quality - some brilliant, some very wide of the mark. Brian, by contrast, is almost flawless; it looks a million dollars (well, £3m), it's laugh out loud funny, it's crammed to the gunwales with classic scenes, lines and comedy set-pieces, and it has a clear and unequivocal message.<br /><br />Sadly, but hardly surprisingly, that message is still being missed today as some of the interviews in the Making Of documentary demonstrate. LoB is not an attack on Christ, nor even on the central tenets of any particular religion. It is simply poking fun at blind, unquestioning, dogmatic belief. The best example of how life followed art was the way in which the film was vilified and in many cases banned before anyone had actually seen it. One council member is interviewed about his decision to ban the film from cinemas in his district; \\"This is precisely the sort of thing we don't want in this town.\\"* \\"Have you seen it?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Do you know what's in it?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Do you know anything about the organisation who has told you that you should ban it?\\" \\"No.\\" Nuff said really.<br /><br />Back to the film itself; it is not only the pinnacle of Python, but it is one of the best comedies of the 20th Century and is, as a bonus, a sumptuous biblical epic (the film crew had the set of Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth to work with). But a don't take my word for it, make your own mind up. After all, you're all different.<br /><br />The Immaculate Edition includes a heavenly host of extras, including an insightful documentary and deleted scenes. The best bits are easily missed, however: the radio ads for the show, done by Michael Palin's Dentist, and the mothers of Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese are hilarious.<br /><br />* I'm paraphrasing.f Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth to work with).

B00CVFTDKU|5.0|Set on the U.K.'s wind-buffeted Dorset coast (filmed in Clevedon), ITV's \\"Broadchurch\\" is a mystery series that deeply engages the audience. The narrative follows the loss and trauma following the murder of a young boy, and the search for his killer. Thankfully, for fans who faithfully followed this compelling show, \\"Broadchurch\\" will be returning for a second series in 2014! When \\"Broadchurch\\" was originally transmitted in the U.K., viewership grew so much that by the series conclusion, the producers and writers (who had only intended one series) were compelled to continue.<br /><br />Series One begins on a hazy summer morning along the lovely Dorset coastline, during the tourist season. An 11 year old boy, Danny Latimer (Oskar McNamara), goes missing. His mother, awoken with nightmares in the wee hours, desperately searches for her son. Later in the day, his body is discovered below the white cliffs. The mystery involves an entire community, exploring bonds of trust that are tested and broken. The remarkable cast makes \\"Broadchurch\\" standout. David Tennant is one of the best actors out there; as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, he brings an award-winning level of intensity and nuance to the part. DI Hardy, buffeted by life, takes this case after barely surviving the ensuing scandal when a previous case was bungled; the victim's parents continue to blame him for the failure. Viewers learn that there is more to his past, and tragedy drives Hardy to solve this new case, despite its effect on his frail health.<br /><br />Olivia Colman is Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller; she lost out on a promotion to newcomer DI Hardy. She is a good friend to Danny's mother, Beth Latimer (the superb Jodie Whittaker is utterly convincing), and her young son Tom (Adam Wilson) was apparently Danny's friend. Wrestling with grief, Beth Latimer discovers she is pregnant with her third child, a situation all the more tumultuous after she discovers that her husband Mark (Andrew Buchan) has been having an affair with Becca Fisher (Simone McAullay). Becca works at the hotel where DI Hardy is staying. Beth turns to her vicar, the Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill, glad to see he survived a thankless role in \\"Doctor Who\\"), for solace. Beth's frail faith is shaken to the core by the loss of her son, his absence is palpable.<br /><br />DS Ellie Miller's husband, Joe (Matthew Gravelle), seems to be oblivious to their son's problems, while trying to support his wife. DS Miller dislikes DI Hardy and his cynicism, and finds the investigation of her community quite difficult to cope with. An unsavory element is the muckraking of journalists. The editor of the local paper, Maggie Radcliffe (Carolyn Pickles), attempts to control junior reporter Olly Stevens (Jonathan Bailey); he is Ellie's nephew. Jack Marshall (the superb David Bradley, of \\"Harry Potter\\") faces terrible accusations when his past is unearthed; the actor David Bradley should be far better known. Another suspect, Susan Wright (Pauline Quirke is perfect) menaces Maggie one evening at the paper. Susan lives on the beach in a trailer, and knows more than she lets on. She has strange relationship with plumber Tom Latimer's employee Nigel Carter (Joe Sims), and Nigel threatens her with a crossbow. Throughout, it appears Danny may have been blackmailing people; there is an undertow of darkness in Broadchurch.<br /><br />No matter how surrounded he is by coworkers and the community Broadchurch suspects, Detective Inspector Alec Hardy is dreadfully alone. Just as Broadchurch's cliffs drop dramatically to the sea, where water meets land and sky in sharp delineation, his soul seems on the cusp of a precipitous fall. Aside from a fine cast overall, the show's momentum is provided by its leads. David Tennant as DI Hardy inhabits the character from the inside out. Tennant, a remarkable actor, conveys a soul tormented by immense pressure, a storm within and without. Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, shesummons up a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold. The last scene, with beacons of torchlight and bonfires shimmering in the darkness along the coast, and Beth seeing Danny's ghost, is deeply evocative. Enjoy.summons up a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold.

B005SAJJHM|5.0|Big Bang rocks.  It is so easy to download and carry with me on my Kindle Fire.  It always puts a smile on my face when life has me down.  No commercial breaks you can just watch the show non stop.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|A great app. Challenging and really captures the Magic experience. Easy on battery life but occasionally hard to open. Well done overall.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|What I like about this show is the &#34;know it all&#34; pretty boys are always getting into trouble because they think the know it all and too  pretty to suffer any issues. the hubris of privilege so we can all feel better about our lack of.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|From the the Bank of Evil being called \\"Formerly Known as Lehman Brothers,\\" the humor is sharp, and for adults of all ages! We love the minions! Who of you has stood in a long line at a coffee shop and not wished for Gru's freeze-ray? And we want his car, his house, his dog-creature, and a dozen minions or so would not go amiss. Steve Carell is perfect as Gru. He sounds like some of my relatives, but more cheery. Julie Andrews is a revelation as his despicable mom, what a far cry from \\"The hills are alive...\\" Good for her! This really is a loving family movie, about the meaning of finding your real home. Three adorable orphans, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, warm Gru's heart; we love the scene where he wins the unicorn! The minions save the day, and we hope the one floating past the moon finds his drifty way home. Highly recommended, along with minion accoutrements, such as ever-handy [[ASIN:B00CYQ36GS Duck Brand 281973 Despicable Me Printed Duct Tape]]. Enjoy!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I have just about every Angry Birds version there is, and this is by far my favorite. I am also a huge fan of Star Wars, and I loved the first Angry Birds Star Wars. This is, without a doubt, way better. Plus, the Amazon appstore now offers a free version. This app is a must have for anyone who likes Star Wars or Angry Birds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ The Pork Side (pigs launched at birds)<br />+ Tons of New Characters with Many New Abilities<br />+ New Features<br />+ Great Graphics<br />+ Awesome Music<br />+ Simple to Learn<br />+ Challenging Levels<br />+ Ability to Use Different Birds/Pigs (as you progress)<br />+ Telepods (purchased separately to load birds/pigs into game)<br />+ Free<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Advertisements<br />- Encourages IAPs<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is a GREAT app, I definitely recommend it. The new characters are so cool, I was so excited when I found that Amazon had released this app.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|The best scene in this movie is the gasoline fight after Derek and his friends go out for Orange Mocha Frappucinos. One of the greatest movie moments since the advent of American Cinema. Also, Will Farrel is great as the evil fashion mogul, Mugatu.

B008469DGY|4.0|Pretty decent, warning - can be addictive.  Would be 5 stars if it featured the whole course rather than repeating holes.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  Has always been one of my favorite movies, let alone my favorite one of John Wayne's.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|If they don't do the sequel, they're wrong! This movie is amazing. I don't even care if the storyline is so-so. It's the way they tell the story.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Runs good but takes a while to launch on s4..graphics and game play are smooth though..plays just like the pc version
0062103377|5.0|For any SuperNatural fan this is a fun book!  A few laughs while reading and lots of information on all things wierd...
B0018LMZOO|5.0|I grew up with the Moody Blues, not only through my school years but even after school and beyond that
B000SP1SEO|5.0|Easily in my top 5 movies of all time. Pitt is genius as the pikey bare-knuckle fighter. Statham puts in a solid performance. Although Vinny Jones is probably the highlight of the movie. One of Guy Ritchie's best. Fantastic film. Highly recommended it if you're a manly man.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Loved this series!  Can't wait for the next book! Please write faster!  I need to know what happens to everyone!
B00B52F278|4.0|Bloody enough for a mass murderer.  Naked enough for  nudist.  No crucifixion for this Spartacus.  Kirk must be jealous. Boom
B0018LMZOE|5.0|I grew up with the Moody Blues, not only through my school years but even after school and beyond that
B00E88YNJY|4.0|Valerie June has a very unique voice, sometimes it grates on me but for the most point I really enjoy it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I didn't read the other two books, so I can't compare it to them, but this was well written and I enjoyed it.  The only down side is that there were a lot of characters and although each was interesting, it was too much work for me to figure out how they all affected the main characters in the book.
0307951529|5.0|I loved this book!  It was very inspiring, and full of all sorts of useful tips and ideas.  I'm going to buy a couple more, and send them to friends I know will enjoy it.  I'm inspired and motivated.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|I grew up with the Moody Blues, not only through my school years but even after school and beyond that
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Gritty, dark, violent, unflinching, and surprisingly very smart.<br /><br />Some people might be surprised Karl Urban's the star of this, but given the depth he puts into his roles, it's a perfect fit. He *is* Dredd, not Sylvester Stallone playing someone named Dredd. Given the disappointment of the Robocop trailer and likely the film that will follow it, this definitely is the antidote to concerns that they just don't make movies like the original Robocop anymore.<br /><br />They made a believable world, and this is one story of one day in that world.<br /><br />I've watched it about three times now, and listened to the soundtrack many, many more and I don't think I'll ever get sick of either.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Fun and challenging with no rerunning actions. Keeps your mind sharp and helps in problem solving, and measure tactics. good bye
B001NLL93W|5.0|Now that I am on my last book I . Am literally going to c r y when it's over
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|This was a well written and well acted movie. The directing was excellent. Good story line and the movie never goes over the top.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|WOW I didnt see this coming at all. I thought Calvin Harris was alone on this area of taking electronic music and making a good vocal album and Avicii did it here.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I don't know how I missed this show for so long but I am glad I finally joined the party.  This thing is awesome.  Great cast and story lines with tons of action.  I can't wait to watch the rest of the seasons.
B00005N52P|5.0|The movie is an excellent movie. I have seen it before but the one I got through Amazon is in German and I can't understand a word that is being said. I will have to be much more careful in buying through Amazon in the future.<br /><br />John Young
B00915G6MG|5.0|Its amazing they are still coming up with new cases.  Will recommend to others.<br />What can we say we have all the seasons and have watched them over and its still good.
B007N85POS|5.0|Good game! !  Really easy to play.  Enjiy playing game.  Could have more instructions on how to play though but generaklt a good game!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A must have tool, I've used it on all types of knifes. A great buy for the price, can't be beat
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Can watch on my kindle on the go good sound great picture glad this is available for the kindle. Great
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|Not one of his better movies.  Did like it that much and will probably sell it later on.  Not much action
B00EBDXTJG|5.0|One of my all time favorite CD's I hope everyone has in their collection to pass on.to younger people and their kids.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|This was a great movie with a very tragic ending which I did not expect at all.  I was hoping that after all the suffering, this girl would finally be happy, but to my surprise she suffered to the very end.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is so much fun but I want all the stuff and that is the not so fun part but anyways it is fun!
B008JFUO36|4.0|Not really a Tom Cruise fan, but this one seems to be on point.  Good action.  Would recommend to others.
1591845556|5.0|I saw the YouTube video on this book and was hooked on the topic. The book is well written and the samples are a great guide to implement the idea. Learn more quickly and maximize your time with the concepts in this book. If learning a new skill read this first.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I started book 1 with no information about it, this is not something I usually do or the type of book I typically choose to read, though I was sick of hearing references about it from my friends. Curiosity finally got the best of me when I had nothing left to read on my Kindle. So I finally impulsively bought it as I had just returned from a vacation and was bored.<br />That said I was  certainly surprised that I did find it captivating. I read it in a day and started reading the second book immediately... oddly finding the second book even better and more polished, perhaps even more interesting. Again it has only taken me a mere 24 hrs of reading time and instantly buying the third. The author saved the best for last Literally. The epilogue being the most interesting and intriguing piece of the puzzle.<br />So 4 days ago is when I began and now I am left curious. Am I missing something here? I want the rest of Grey's side.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I cannot say enough Good stuff about this book. If you were at all interested in memory memory techniques learning education or Western civilization you really ought to read it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this app. Currently have it on my phone, I pod, and tablet.<br />Enjoy the variety of playing options.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it. I like games like this. Some are easy and others are more challenging. I can spend hours on games like this.
0553593714|5.0|I love this book. The author develops the story through the eyes of each character. I cant wait to finish the next book. I am going to finish the first couple books before I watch the show.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Great cheap app.  Easy and fun to play but you can still get creative!  Wish there was a multiple user option.
B000001FK3|4.0|As mentioned in an earlier review of a J.J. Cale recording, for us Baby Boomers, J.J. Cale is the music of our youth.  He was a terrific musician, and the appeal of his music has lasted, at least for me.  It's great road music, for singing along while rolling down the highway to Portland.<br />His sound is laid back, cool, and seductive, and just rolls us right back to 1968.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love it. I feel more involved with the world. It keeps me connected to the local news when I can't watch TV.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Great actors saves this film from disaster. The story is complex, but not in a good way. I left wondering what the film was all about.
1455518999|4.0|While fiction murder mystery is not my favorite genre (I prefer true crime), I found the story compelling enough to hold my interest until the end.  Protagonists Puller and Cole are well-developed and, while not exactly realistic characters, they are endearing enough that I actually missed them when finished reading.  The story provides ample twists, turns and surprises.  This is my first Baldacci book and I do appreciate that he only hints at vague sexual tension between characters, unlike the in-your-face nonsense employed by his contemporaries.  I'll no doubt pick up another of his books soon.
140006922X|4.0|The intriguing, insightful, fascinating, perhaps disagreeable and most definitely controversial book by Azlan will appeal to a variety of readers regardless of their religious background.  Perhaps its most notorious aspect is that Azlan is a prominent Muslim, causing some critics to suspect the writer of having a different agenda (see the Fox News interview conducted pathetically by Lauren Green, which attempts to discredit the book but instead launches it to The New York Times Best Seller List).  However, Azlan shows no sign of promoting his Muslim faith in the text of this book or the Fox/Green interview; and, for that matter, Azlan even went out of his way to defend the Christian/Holy Bible’s influence while he was a guest panelist on Real Time With Bill Maher.<br /><br />In many ways, the accounts progress like a novel rather than a biography, which ends up strengthening the book’s readability.  The text itself have been somewhat simplified to appeal to readers who are not religious scholars and/or keen on basic elements of Christianity.  Though never dull, the book has a tendency to provide detailed historical background in order to give context to the whos/whats/whens/wheres/whys/hows of the events in question, but at some points become a little tedious.<br /><br />Despite its good qualities, the book has some room for improvement.  For one, footnotes would make more sense; but Azlan instead either trails off by jumping back-and-forth between hundreds of years in time, or saves some interesting material for an extensive “Notes” section after the book is finished.  Apparently, Azlan also takes influence from 19th-century German scholarships which are mostly rejected by today’s standards.  While Azlan writes that this book cannot be all fact and that some of it has to be theory, he could have at least only drawn inspirations from sources that aren’t questionable, just for the sake of avoiding further controversy.<br /><br />All-in-all, Azlan presentsan account that is very plausible and is, at the very least, incredibly interesting.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like it. I have Pintrest for my iPhone and it seems more easy to use. I just started on Pintrest so maybe i need more time.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|I've loved this band and their music since first hearing them in 2008.  This is an immediately captivating and invigorating collection of songs, and is a \\"Natural Progression\\" from their first two albums - the surfers among us will understand the NP reference.  Some reviewers on Amazon have opined that this is a disorienting departure from \\"Congratulations\\" and \\"Oracular Spectacular\\".  My response to that criticism is this:  if you're looking for music composition that follows a formula, and if you prefer performers who sing songs written by others, stick with Beyonce.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and wonderfully creative move forward for MGMT - it is a fantastic album!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great stories and characters. It's nice to have the entire trilogy in such a compact form. Except for a few typos here and there, a great e-book.
B0049VZ222|4.0|Good story line....plot keeps it interesting.  Not just a bunch of dead guys chomping on the living.  Worth a look.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love it. Better than Twitter. No problems so far. Easy to use. No complaints yet. (Except no Candy Crush for the Kindle)
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Just so most excellent. Entertaining. If you liked \\"Field of Dreams\\" and mystery without being spoon feed all the answers is your cup-of-tea, go for this one. Date movie? For sure. Viewing with spouse?? Great for that too. Guys only??? Yes. Kids??? Don't think so. Recommend highly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a great addition to the series.  The whole series is well written and keeps you guessing about what will happen next.  It is a depressing commentary on the worst traits of humanity though.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Its amazing that they managed to get all of these guys (large egos) to work together.  Decent plot and o.k. acting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it. Some levels are super easy and others make me want to throw the Kinde on the floor. I love the challenge.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I was quite pleased with the &#34;Relax Melodies&#34;. Especially loved  Storm /Wind chimes; I played them both together & became very relaxed & comfy, needless to say I slept well that night.  Thankyou  Amazon!!
B009A882D0|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! Creedence never fails to disappoint. One of the greatest bands there ever was.
B00915G6MG|4.0|Came in good condition from Amazon, my favorite online place to shop! Have one more disk to finish, but so far all have been in good condition
B002VECM4A|5.0|I love anything about my saler I will continued to buy other items at this low -price. keep up the good work

B009JZSC9S|5.0|Love this series<br />Can't wait for the next season to start<br />My schedule is sometimes hectic, so it's nice to be able to watch whenever I can
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock was initially a backup. It is now the primary. I can see it in all lighting and the dimmable feature is nice.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|It was a gift for my grandson, he was thrilled with it!  I was so happy to see him that happy!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Sound and Fury signifying nothing.  The first 15 minutes of the black and white portion  piqued my interest but after that . . .
B004XUMMFE|3.0|It doesn't really start to get interesting until over halfway through the season and then by the time you are engaged, it's over. The River character never developed into anything helpful, really.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very addictive. I'm always finding new ways to make my city awesome. I check in with my city multiple times a day.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product !! We love it and will never go back to cable again. Thank you for this awesome gadget !
B00CLD671A|5.0|The actors and writers have created and developed characters that are plausible. I want to know each of them more intimately, especially Thomas.

B009WO7NQO|3.0|Since the last update this game wont work please fix the problem. If it worked it would get 5 stars great game!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love the book.  Not sure if I want to see the movies after reading the book.  I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|For those whinging about the duplication of tracks, the sound, the packaging, misleading notes for the DVD and RR in general, you can pick up a no-frills, 8-track version of \\"Rock of Ages\\" (Capitol, 8XC-11088 and 8XC-11089) on eBay for $10, plus $3.50 for economy shipping.  Enjoy.  For those on the fence, Bud Scoppa wrote a great, short piece about this release in the October issue of \\"Uncut.\\"
B004J64QSI|5.0|This musical is a timeless classic. If you loved it on Broadway and you want to see it like never before? You must watch this video.
071815780X|5.0|Excellent cookbook, great photos. Trade was fast and easy. Good condition, as expected. Will recommend. Thanks for the trade :)
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I am now watching this whole series again.,...for the third time. I just love John Flannagan (Lt. Colonel Shephard), Tayla, Ronan and the always funny Dr. McKay played by David Hewlet, his best performance ever I think, was as this character. This is probably rated as sci fi but has to be scifi-fantasy. Yes, they travel through a Stargate to other worlds and meet other people, which may be hopefully sci fi (wouldn't you love to be able to do that? I would) but those people speaking English is probably all fantasy. The villains, the Wraith, are wonderful fantasy too, or nightmare horror. So now we are talking scifi-fantasy-horror genre. But really they always escape and  you know they will, even though they may escape with some aftereffects. If you want some really good entertainment complete with humor, check this series out! Like I said, it is my third time.
B002WY65VU|3.0|Somewhat entertaining and decent for a tongue in cheek flick.  Possibly disappointed as it was oversold by friends.  Small cast was engaging and cameo by Bill Murray was amusing.
1401322786|5.0|If you've read any of Mitch Albom's other books dealing with &#34;life lessons,&#34; you will enjoy this one also.  It is a masterfully told and captivating tale that will nurture your soul.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Never read a book where a boy was so emotional. I guess there is a lot more to a person than you can think of.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I am now watching this whole series again.,...for the third time. I just love John Flannagan (Lt.

B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a great little card game.  Games are fast paced and fun.  Recommend for people that like other Euro games and older children.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This was an amazing book, love cassandra clare and she does not disappoint. You will fall in love with the characters more and more! Really recommend this series!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|In the last 3 days, I have reread this book 3 times to wrap my head around the complicated, amazing story of Mia and Adam. I was first agitated and hurt by Adam's intensity and bitterness, while confused by Mia's apprehension and withdrawal. I didn't appreciate the ending as much and thought it was kind of cheesy. But I read it all over again and let my initial emotions calm to understand both Mia and Adam's motivations. In my final read, I was able to digest the sincere love that can hurt so much but heal too.<br /><br />I am humbled by the way Gayle Forman takes you to the edge of your emotional spectrum between If I Stay and Where She Went. It is hard to reconcile the two books by the same author that have diverging, clear and distinct narratives. Where She Went will having you running from angsty, confused, torn, sad, tired, but after all that, hopeful and understanding the depth of selfishness in sacrifice, and love.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie its cute and funny geat for grown up and kids<br /> my son loves watching it and this movie never gets old
B003O86FMW|5.0|I simply love the entire series.  It was a great read and held my attention.  I did not want to put the book down.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I fell in love with this series, and just could not put all of the books down! As soon as I finished one book I had to order the next!
B001NHNG64|4.0|The adventures of Jack Reacher in the wilds of the west was certainly a page turner.  No on to Lee Child's #3.
B000CNFC76|4.0|this movie reflect the real storry of a legend. It's well done with all the important fact and real images.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|The Make up, costumes, set design, props, were excellent.  The story was well crafted, and perfect cast for male and female leads.Would recommend.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Couldnt be more satisified  everything was  there as published  and Kiddo enjoying  it  on his tablet<br />Thank you Chris<br />Highly recommended
B000024JI7|5.0|There's lots of good songs on this record.  Meatloaf always pours his heart and soul into every song he sings.  I'm glad I added this to my Meatloaf collection!
B005LAII3A|2.0|Good special effects but the story did not match the original Total Recall.  Colin Farrel was ok, but would not recommend.
B00005KHJM|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released in the late 1960's and really enjoyed it's skewed morality and the intriguing concept of paganism surviving into modern times in the outer isles of Scotland.  I had a copy of the film on VHS and wanted to upgrade to DVD.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is a snap-and-go device. I plugged it to an HDMI port on my TV, it does not need separate power. Once I downloaded the Chrome plug-in on my PCs, broadcasting any content from the browser is just a click. Quality is breathtaking. Multiple devices can control the TV, regardless of which device is sending the content. Love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This a great app for horse people of all ages. Compete and care for your horse from the comfort of your own tablet.

1433502410|3.0|There is no question, this is a great interpretation of the Bible.<br />However, the font is too small for me to read.<br />I wish this study bible was offered in Large Print and then it<br />would be &#34;ten&#34; stars!!!
1416955070|5.0|Read the book because I saw the movie. I really enjoyed it...one part in particular is rather strange, but what can you expect in young adult literature these days?
B004HO6I2E|4.0|As a 45 year old male, I have to admit sometimes it's hard getting around to watching what some might call \\"Chick Flicks\\"...but everytime I do I really enjoy them...call it my guilty pleasure. Pay no heed to the mindless bafoons who don't enjoy a good old fashioned raunchy comedy..they must really be real old!  One word for this movie AWESOME!!!
B000W07EKW|4.0|Used product, but in excellent condition.<br />Have watched the set several times and will have a classice movie series for years.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book because I think this book is an example of the magic kindness can do and that if you don't care what other people think you will be happier in the long run this book is definitely a must read
B001V7UXG2|5.0|From Monty Python to Fawlty Towers, the list of great British Comedy series has to include Jeeves and Wooster.  I happen to favor it over the other two because it relies less on slapstick and more on dry wit.  It keeps me laughing even as I re visit it for the umpteenth time.  Maybe it's the period displayed and the mores of the time, the upper class pretentions of the British aristocracy of the twenties and thirties and the comeuppance delivered by the valet that makes it so delightfully amusing.  There is a similar piece of comedy in the series &#34;The Irish RM&#34; with the &#34;simple&#34; Irish folk leading around the British Resident Magistrate unaware of how he's being played.<br />At any rate, PG Wodehouse on whose stories this is based is a superb writer who captures the foibles of the pretentious. .
B008RA3X5E|5.0|it wakes me up rely quick because my brother is in middle school.so I have to wake him up.and my mom
B00C061HZY|5.0|Listen to vinyl is an amazing experience, listen to Daft Punk is awesome, listen to Random Access Memories on vinyl is just fantanctic.<br /><br />This is an double-LP 180gr. and the audio quality is top noch.<br />Includes an booklet with sool graphics and lyrics.<br /><br />The album includes a digital download in 320kbps<br /><br />Don´t think twice, just grab your copy!
B00F35B8F8|3.0|The movie itself was good, but the streaming was bad. In the first 5 minutes of the movie I had to wait 25 minutes for the stream to catch up. The picture quality dropped from HD to what looked like 8bit. The sound dipped so low I could no longer hear it by the 1/2 hour movie mark (1hour actual time from drop outs and waiting). Finally I gave up on the tv and watched the remainder of the movie on my iPad where the drop outs were fewer.
0345803493|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading the 2nd book of this trilogy.  I bought all three books.  Can't wait to see the movie!
1594746036|3.0|I eagerly began this book and couldn't wait to find out what the grandfather's Jewish heritage and experiences in WWII had to do with his young grandson and the strange stories and photos the grandfather mesmerized the boy with.  Once the grandson and his father, when the grandfather's death resulted in the boy's nightmares and social withdrawal, determine to go to the island seeking answers, I lost interest quickly. (Disclaimer: I generally don't read fantasy.) The initial writing was funny, cuttingly witty, and plausible, but once the fantasy element took over I found myself quickly skimming pages just to get to the end and find out what eventually happens.  The author does a commendable job of explaining magical elements of time loops, wights, etc.; however, the connections between the 'peculiar' children housed on the island and their relation to the grandfather and his grandson never really cut it in my opinion.  I gave the book three stars for the author's creative writing and flights of fancy that concocted this story using bizarre photos. Fantasy lovers will find it totally engaging; however, it wasn't really 'my cup of tea.'.
0345803485|5.0|I love E. L. James writing.  I had heard about this trilogy and bought the first one to read it.  I bought the other two and read both of them.  R rating.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Didn't know there was a new Die Hard movie until I saw it foe sale on Amazon.com.  Just had to buy it!  My husband and me love the Die Hard movies!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|My granddaughter requested this movie for her birthday.  She loves it. I like the movie also and have watched it several times.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|My favorite author strikes again.  Can't wait for the next volume! Jeffrey Archer is a very good story teller and this story is great
0345803507|5.0|E. L. James is a phenominal writer. I read the first two books and was hooked.  This book should be R rated for adults only.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book should be a must read for everyone.  It opens up the mind to a world that has always been before us.  It has a great potential to bring people back to the Bible.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I bought this CD for my grandson who has a love of older rock.  He loved it.  I have always been a fan of Kansas and have several CD also.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|My husband enjoyed this movie..but my 3 year old...not so much.. save it for older kids. Still nice to reminisce about old video games.
B002APU580|5.0|I bought this movie because my granddaughter requested it for her birthday.  She loved it.  I have not seen it but plan to.
B009346RSS|5.0|Used this to convert Apple TV optical audio to 2-wire audio for input to receiver.  It Works fine, as expected.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|I bought this movie set as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  He loved all of these movies and wanted them for his movie collection.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|I personally loved the movie.  If you could make The Last of Us into a movie, this is probably it.
B005LAII80|5.0|couldn't have been more pleased with this movie. As a huge fan of the comics, I was nervous of how they would portray Judge Dredd this time around. It was awesome start to finish. Hopefully a sequel can be made with a higher budget that allows more of mega city one to be done.
B009JBWOU0|2.0|Only sent me two out of the three discs in the trilogy. Luckily I had the dark knight so I didn't complain.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This book had a good plot which a kept you eager to read the next chapter.  A nice easy read.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I love this game.  Engaging, thought provoking, fun and FREE.  What more can you ask for?  Give it a try.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|i have a problem. i cant remember my passcode and in email it dosent send me the password when i told it to.
0345803493|5.0|This is the third book in series I purchased. I borrowed the first and couldn't wait to read all three. Didn't do much around the house until I finished the series. Great.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|With this  cast and director I really expected more. THe move is GORGEOUS but the story line tries to take on too much in too little time. Some of the reasoning and actions feel stretched and I love fantasy and am always forgiving.
0345803507|5.0|Loved this series and couldn't put it down. I borrowed the first book and purchased the second two. Wow! Wow!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|The plot is pretty good but missing some pizzaz. Sean Penn makes a good crazy gangster. The ending was fitting. All in all a pretty good flick.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This was a good story.  I didn't think I would like at first and I really did. Good job. Thanks.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|This movie would be great for kids. All and all it is pretty wholesome and Percy is a great &#34;nice&#34; Hero character. Very little angst here comparatively speaking and lets face it we can all do with a little less angst in this day and age. This was a great modernization of sorts with greek mythology.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I loved how fast i received ST:ITD. The Movie was great and i loved the way it came in 4 versions. Because i will so get a 3D TV... Thanks Amazon I Love You Guys
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love the music; It is very relaxing.  The game is challenging. Not to hard and not to easy either. all in all a good game.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This book sounded fascinating, and it started out that way.  A real page-turner - at first.  But the further along it went, the more preposterous it was.  By the end, it was simply ridiculous.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A good way to waste an hour. More cleaver than most movies and kept my attention. It was at least original which is more than I can say for most movies these days.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|Great when you can't get the password right. I like the Gmail set hip better than the. Other  emails I can get. Many  .message  typed. Better..
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This product does exactly what is intended: it allows my ultrabook laptop to connect with my network when I am at my office.  No problems!
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|Never tire of hearing Motown classics and Michael can really belt them out.  He does Detroit proud!  Great to have in a collection.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Overall a smash hit in my eyes.  Truly a great experience and a better understanding of the old english values.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|This is a great collection of Depeche Mode....will take you back to the &#34;good ol' days&#34; in the eighties!  Enjoy!
0486275590|5.0|The book reminds me of the time I would read fairy tale stories and get transported to the land of animated and colorful characters. I am much older now but somehow the book's charm hasn't grown any weaker. I bought this one recently and was again intrigued by the imagination of the author - a timeless classic that takes you beyond the realms of this realistic world devoid of fantasy. :)
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I love this game!  I enjoy picking it up and playing a few levels and then putting it down for awhile and doing something else.  That is the type of game I like.  The skill level is difficult enough to challenge me but easy enough so that I can solve the games eventually, with enough tries.<br />My kind of game.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I enjoy shows that are based on intellectual acuity. The characters are well developed and the relationship feels honest and true to life situations.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|Nice game to play and then put down for awhile.  I like that I can try again and again until I solve the more difficult levels without penalty.  I play on a Kindle Fire HD and it is very pleasing to the eye.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I'm a Dr Who fanatic, without cable access, and I love being able to watch it at my convenience back to back when I feel like it.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|well  Nalina  can't get it wrong,  she gets it right every time.  wow from the first book in this series till now they get better and better.  one of my favorites.  keep on writing. love it all.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|I first experienced Laura Mvula's unique talent a few months ago, while viewing her live performance on the BBC's \\"Later...with Jools Holland\\".  Ms. Mvula and her band stole the show!  Every track on the Sing to the Moon CD is special and well crafted.  Her articulate vocal and musical arrangements are beautiful revelations, that touch and cleanse the soul.  Listen and feel blessed!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My niece loves this app.  I get confuse when I watch her but she seems to have master it.  In fact we both love the movie and can recite every detail.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Very good movie. Although good acting, The story and plots certainly not original otherwise I give it a five star.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My niece loves this app.  She plays it over and over again.  She is 6 years old and very inventive.
B00AC8ZA3M|2.0|This movie is more for teenagers. I can tell, not much thought go into it. Great movie for those family gatherings.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|Lancaster PA puts out the greatest music on the planet and this album is right up top with the best of them.
1577314808|5.0|Really resonated with me. Bought three more copies to give to loved ones hoping they will have an epiphany about how they live their lives sooner than I have.
B008F9T76Q|4.0|I liked  that the story plot kept my attention , it was realistic used today terminolgy, it made for an easy read . I wanted to finish the first to see what happened in the next yet i still wanted to remember the details of this . That could be because I knew there was  a next book . perhaps if I had ordered seperately not knowing there was a next I  would feel differently. Over all I 'm enjoying  reading them
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Played this game in Turkey now my husband and I can play it anywhere.  Good game for traveling.  Can be played one player also.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Since everybody's got a smartphone at my house, the need for a dual port charger was necessary.<br />The Anker charger is a great option. Seems it will last long enough besides its size.<br />Clean, neat, a must have!
B00CATONCA|5.0|This was packaged very, very well and I was so happy with everything about it!  Better than I thought!  The floating heads and everything! YAY!! Thank you!!!
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|A fine return to skull pummeling melodic death metal for these Brits. It seems a bit repetitive and \\"samey\\" at first, but with repeated listens this one is bound to be a true contender for album of the year because all the elements you'd really want in an album of this nature are all present and the band is shown in top form, essentially starting right from where they left off 17 years ago, and potentially surpassing that point. Like fine wine, this band has refined their core sound while also retaining the brutality and visceral edge that made them a classic band right form the get-go. A great album for any metal collection.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|But needed more Iron Man scenes and Tech.<br />The Iron Man suite colors also were not appealing.<br />Tony should have used more suites.<br /><br />Also save the Hulk Buster Suit for another movie.<br /><br />Didnt like the Villain, he was more of an Xman villain.
B00006D295|5.0|I've seen this movie a couple of times and I still get a big kick out of it.  I invited my cousin John to come see it and we had a lot of laughs aas we watched it.
B004D9FLJE|3.0|The hit series Glee has brought Broadway style musical productions to a high school soap opera style format.  The show is loaded with fresh energy and bright new talent.  The series tries very hard at presenting diversity.  Unfortunately, the writing can get preachy and sometimes misses the mark.  For example, the episode called \\"The Power of Madonna\\" celebrates the artist as some kind of goddess of female empowerment. Madonna objectifies males (Boy Toys) far more than championing equality or respect.  Sue Sylvester (played well by Jane Lynch)is an over the top physical education instructor that creates havoc.  In reality, a teacher that bullies like this could not survive the rigors of the profession.<br /><br />This show is for adults.  It is fantasy with their elaborate production numbers.  It can also be fun to watch.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Widescreen DVD was excellent! The movie was fun and exciting I recommend it. This is a must for all trek fans.
B003GAB6QI|5.0|Its better on Amazon than the one I watched on tv years ago. Got a wild hare a purchased the movie glad I did, all the naughtiness that makes this a 70ish movie is there and its definatly not for kids because all the scenes are there thus its not censored in any way.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Grew up in Main Line Philadelphia and my maiden name is the same as the Kathryn Hepburn character. The move that KH makes when she sees the light of day after a night of too much Champagne is a classic.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|The beautiful story of Cranford continues in this great story inspired by Elizabeth Gaskell's novel.  The cast is superb, the costumes beautiful and the story heartwarming.  How can you go wrong?  I've always loved Dame Judi and she has never disappointed.  This will be a great addition to any fan's collection of things British.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This toaster works perfectly, makes the bread just crispy enough without really burning it. After tons of toasters that just burn the bread totally black, this was a huge relief.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is one of my favorite reads...it was absolutely a pleasure to read from the start to finish! Awesome read!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a fitting end to the series. Mr.Sanderson picked it up fine. I`m feeling sad that this epic journey is over. Godspeed RJ.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|doesn't show all info as same app on my I phone, humidity, sunrise ,sunset etc. viewing on kindle fire's bigger screen is nice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked the first and was really anxious about  reading the second book in the series  and once I started to read it I was hooked!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This CD is fantastic! Imagine Dragons has a great sound variety & I love their music =)  I highly recommend this CD
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I loved the book. I'm not sure how exactly you would make a movie that reflects the book but do yourself a favor and read it. We enjoyed watching Brad fight the Zombies. The fast moving hordes were terrifying.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What can I say needed a new cord and it fit like it was supposed to. Amazon was right it fit.
B001R88C6I|5.0|Very thought provoking and well made movie.  I've rented this movie many time and also I've had a DVD copy of it but someone stole it.  So, now I've replaced it with a BD copy.<br /><br />--Russell
044022425X|5.0|It's nearly impossible for me to rate any of Gabaldon's books with fewer than 5 stars, and book four in the series is no exception. The book(s) is so good that I felt pangs of sadness as the pages left to read dwindled... but that didn't stop me from powering on through. I simply couldn't stop!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Worked fine with my very old single band wireless router but then I bought a dual band and it stopped working.  I learned that Chromecast does not work with 5.0 ghz so I disabled that band.  Even so I could not see the Chromecast in my iphone's wifi settings (which you need to do to set up Chromecast).  I spent 2 hours on the phone with my wireless router support to get my router to recognize Chromecast, but they couldn't make it work.  My advice is to check whether your wireless router is compatible with Chromecast before you invest the money.  Must add that I've been using roku for a few years and I like it very much.  Regrettably, I will return the Chromecast.  Update: Google decided I had a defective item and its tech agreed to a warranty replacement.  The warranty replacement dept has contacted me and is dragging its feet.  Device going back to amazon tomorrow.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|I first saw him in Amistad, very impressive and then their wereothers so,so, then came The Paperboy, a quiet release,I think,Killer Joe, and Magic Mike.  These are just a few,I am sure, of the films that gives Matthew,I feel, character.  I did like Mud although when he gave reference to the strickness of his mother-well!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my son who loves these Legos sets. I was glad to see this one discounted on Amazon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting! Once you start,  it's. hard to quit playing. And it was free! Keep running Minions!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is my 2 year olds favorite cartoon. She doesn't usually ask to watch TV but when she does this is the show she wants to watch.
B00BJW6YW6|4.0|Sultry, Smooth, Sensual. As a fan of Milosh, I was encouraged to find this project and hear familiar elements and orchestral approach to a electronic/pop/r&B album. It's a refreshing blend of tones and melody.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Love this show. Well written and brilliantly acted. Good tense realistic police drama. Quality tv!! Looking forward to season two.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|We loved watching his story!  What courage and dedication!  It would be great to see a current follow up on his life!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love all of the songs in this album.  He's a great composer who has not achieved all the recognition he deserves.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|as soon as i finished the 4th book i decided to buy ADwD.<br />the amazing GRRM strikes again with the characters he made me love so much!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It got to be quite a challenge. I solved all ten puzzles in about an hour. I cant wait for more levels.
B009S33I68|4.0|Loved it. The book gives good insight on the hardship that Moore and his Soldiers faced in Vietnam. This book was a good read.
0143121421|5.0|It's been a while since I read a book I couldn't put down. Highly recommended to anybody who enjoys cliffhangers and espionage.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Average. McConaughey is ok. Nothing jumps off the screen. Story was decent.  If you're a McConaughey fan you'll enjoy it. Reese Witherspoon is good, could have seen more of her
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed the storyline of these lost souls finally connecting with each other and the fragility of a new relationship. VERY similar to Fifty Shades in many ways, although the main character is absolutely not a Bella/Anastasia knock-off. Readers that were looking for a stronger main character will enjoy that aspect of this novel.<br /><br />Ms. Day's prose is gorgeous for the most part. The thing I didn't like was that it felt like every few pages I was jarred into the language and pillow talk of an X-rated movie. Guess I like things a bit more subtle.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|My daughter saw this on tv and automatically asked for them.  Delivery on time, product was as expected and exactly what you see on screen.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the movie was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|[...]<br /><br />Wool Omnibus is a collection of novellas that began as a short story that quietly became more popular than the author expected. Since then, Howey has followed through with further stories about the people of this distant, post-apocalyptic dystopia with Shift and finally, Dust. Initially available only in ebook format on Amazon, Wool is now available in print and audiobook, is part of Kindle Worlds and apparently has even been optioned for film. I'm sure some credit goes to Wool #1 being in the right place at the right time and a lot goes to the author's excellent storytelling and character building. But overall, Wool should serve as motivation for all writers to get on out there and tell your story. You never know what might happen!<br /><br />Wool begins with the resigned death walk of Sheriff Holston, who is heading outside the silo for \\"cleaning.\\" This is the punishment for all those who harbour thoughts of the outside. Ironically, cleaning takes place outside, meaning the criminals actually get their wish. Wrapped in suits that can only protect them from the harsh elements for so long, cleaners are tasked with cleaning the screens to the outside world, reminding everyone inside of its horrors and why no one should ever want to leave the safety of the silo.<br /><br />I can see why this initial short story captured people's attention. It is a compelling read filled with questions and emotions and a clear backstory that makes a reader demand more. Fortunately, listening to the complete omnibus meant I didn't have to wait to meet the other people living within the silo and eventually learn the reason behind Holston's punishment and that of his wife before him.<br /><br />One of the really striking things about the Silo Saga is that, unlike many of the other post-apocalyptic stories that I've read, it takes place so far into the future that the people within the silo have no idea that there ever was a world outside of their home in the immense underground structure. I liked the way Howey made this evident through little things that we take for granted. Phrases such as \\"a bull in a China shop\\" hold immediate meaning for us now, but to the people of the silo, a bull is practically a mythical creature and a china shop would not exist at all. This is symptomatic of the ignorance that the people are kept in in order to protect them from the outside world and subsequently prevent uprisings. Inevitably, information will slip out here and there, and an idea will start to fester and grow.<br /><br />Hoslton's death leaves the position of sheriff open and in the next story, the mayor and deputy go on a mission to find the right candidate for the job. Jahns and Marnes are a lovely, elderly couple who are honest and good folk who care for their people and want to do their job well. I loved the way their journey through the many floors brings them closer together, while simultaneously introducing the intricate layers of the silo, complete with its politics, mechanical functions and the lives of the people who live there. Howey has a gift for character building, endearing important characters to you before moving on.<br /><br />Following the selection of Juliette as the new sheriff, the story settles in with her as the main character as she susses out Holston's mystery. This inevitably leads to trouble that dominates the rest of the series. Here the focus gradually moves away from the more personal character developments to deal with the new struggles. Other characters and their point of views are introduced, though I didn't come to care for these characters as much as I did with the previously introduced ones.<br /><br />By the end of Wool, a whole world is opened up, while the mystery of the past remains, enticing me to learn all there is to know through Shift and Dust.ground structure.

B00000IQW5|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the movie was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|this was the 1st book that made me empathize...faintly of course...with a serial killer. the plot is brilliant and the character of jessie is particularly interesting.i can see endless possibilities for the relationship betwween the detectives. the book needs careful editing for style though...seriously!  the language use is awkward and strange. i didnt see big technical errors but the bland, clunky language...if the author could fix that, his book would be up there with the best!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the DVD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B0091REZMW|3.0|So far this seems interesting. It moves a little so and it freezes a little, but willing to give it a shot.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the DVD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|Oleg Medvedkov writes with a kind of uniqueness that just makes you wonder: \\"Where the hell is this guy from?\\" 'Let's Conquer Paris' is a collection of short stories that will take you from your seat to the ground with laughter. So you've gotten yourself a copy? Get ready to have your stomach burst with this new sensational read! The right companion to take with you for a picnic or a lunch break. Highly recommended!
B000002H5I|5.0|Great job in getting me the CD on time.. and the CD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really dysfunctional protagonists.  Read about a year ago so it's not that fresh in my mind.  It was somewhat of a disturbing story
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the DVD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|too complicated and fast moving for the little ones; heck, it's even a tough job for me to even play the game ... if it weren't for being able to at least 'see' and 'hear' the minions; it's not worth the time .... I'll most likely remove it from our unit sometime soon.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the DVD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great for the kids; and, I like it too .... passes the time in a wonderful and happy way .... we laugh about it and have fun with it a lot; my youngest wants to be a pig killer when he grows up ... his brother wants to work with eagles ... a great thing to have around.
B008220D5K|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the DVD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty good! At first it was hard to figure out but got the hang if it. Maybe a guide would be helpful.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Great job in getting me the CD on time.. and the CD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|way to many bugs it wont let me see anything cuz the ads r in the way and it takes to long to loud videos...thers nun wrong with my wifi it works on every other app just fine and it freezes to much and everytime i have this app downloaded it wont let me play ANYTHING WITHOUT FREEZING  all the other apps

1449433251|5.0|Few characters have ever resonated with me like Calvin and Hobbes. The experience of reading their exploits is like a deep dive into my own childhood filled with Tom Swayer, Huck Finn and Peter Pan fantasy adventures! My first encounter with this pair took place during a road trip with several of my brothers. I laughed so hard I had tears running down my face.<br /><br />I bought this full collection to replace the individual books that, in a moment of weakness, I had sold while trying to &#34;clean out&#34;. This year, I introduced my Grandsons to these new friends and they LOVED the books.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have commented on the physical weight of the set and the quality of the binding and printing. I know collectors will not be disappointed, but I plan to read these when my life routine falls into the mundane.
B0099114WO|5.0|Great job in getting me the DVD on time.. and the DVD was GOOD. I am glad to add it to my collection!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Just a great app. Would recommend to anybody. Easy to use and has a lot of information. Most accurate weather app out there
B005651RDS|5.0|Clever adaption of a classic to a contemporary whilst losing none of the fear, loathing and loss or the redemptive power of bravery, integrity and distraction. From 18th centenary England to a Pacific village under siege, Mr Watts brings the Dicken's story, Great Expectations, to life again and Mr Lloyd pens the power of storytelling.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I bought this after watching the movie about 10 times. If you like 80s rock, you will probably enjoy this album with the actors doing their own singing. Tom Cruise is amazing. Who knew? It is upbeat, celebratory without profanity and just plain fun. Great to play on the way to the gym to get my energy up.
B00915G6NK|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted and very fast delivery.  I am pleased and would recommend this product to everyone.  The quality is the best. A MUST BUY!
B008TRH5N6|5.0|This book is filled with fabulous insights, core truths and just might shift your consciousness. The language and examples are dated, as the author is a pioneer in the personal development field and New Thought Movement of the early 20th century. You might think of Dr. Murphy as a grandfather of Tony Robbins. Great stuff and highly recommended!
B005V20JKI|4.0|It's a fun fast paced game. Perfect for a session on the toilet ;) But you need a normal to big screen. Otherwise your thumbs get in the way.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Amazing tracks on this 2-CD collection. Never thought I'd like it so much, given that the original Self Portrait wasn't at the top of my Dylan list. But these tracks are totally incredible.
1577314808|5.0|I think I came across this book at a good time in my life. I have been learning more about mindfulness and appreciating the present and this book really accelerated my growth in that. Tolle opens up with his own personal past troubles and delves into his philosophy by describing his experiences and also answering questions that people have probably asked him along the way.<br /><br />This book helped me open my eyes to what we have right NOW and that it is all we have. It really induced an attitude and perspective shift in the way I see almost everything in my life (especially as it is now). I recommend this book, but I will warn that it may not be very digestible for people who aren't ready for it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game definitely did not disappoint in the least! It has been fun since the first race and the game play is better than the last one! I am very happy with the game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and keeps your interest. It makes you think out side the box and continue thinking. I really enjoy this game.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Who would have thought a show about a motorcycle club would be so good.  Katey Sagal is amazing as Gemma.  Charlie Hunnam simply rocks the character Jax.  He is so sexy and complete eye candy.  The writing and chemistry between the characters is amazing.  I love finding a great show like this and plowing through 5 seasons in two weeks.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|The words are too small describing the charging slot.  I also like there are no glowing lights on it. Buy it!
0761172726|5.0|This year I ordered early enough to use the 15 month feature (Aug, '13 thru Dec.'14).<br />It shows my whole family schedule.  No need for electronical devices.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. It doesn't stay the same for to long and it keeps you on your toes. Very addictive but a fun game.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Found this book to be interesting from a historical viewpoint. Also it was very enjoyable reading. Looked forward to reading it when i came home in the evening.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|More content would make it an ever greater value. To use the smart phone or tablet as the remote is so convenient.<br />More content providers will pile on over time. For now, it is limited to Netflix, Google Play and YouTube.
B00DY951TO|5.0|A great collection of songs from a time when Dylan's voice was at it's finest. I highly recommend this album.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is the most inspiring book I've read in a decade.<br /><br />Anita's low key writing style coupled with her ability to explain her journey is inspiring.  She is one of those rare genuine people that you wish lived next door.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Not too bad. Ending left room for more!!! Tv series definitely used the books more for a guideline than a storyline.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|who dosen`t love sudoku and now they have app for it! i spend hours playing this app and enjoy it very much.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|There are hardly words to describe this book!  Other than being very annoyed that it took awhile to reveal The Husband's Secret and figuring it out before I finally got to that part, this book was totally captivating!  The phrase \\"cause and effect\\" is really the only way to describe the interwoven threads of these people's lives!  And the ending of the book, after all is said and done is superb!  You will not be disappointed!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|very nice game fun to play for all those magic fans out there! ^.- would recommend it if u like card type games.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I spoke to Google about the Chromecast.  The Chromecast specialist confirmed that the item was defective.  He (Keith) also assured me that a new one would be mailed to me within receipt by e-mail of certain information including proof of purchase.  I sent that information 3 days ago.  I sent an email to Google yesterday about it.  No one from Google has contacted me to date.  Hey Google, are you listening.

B00F91SCXC|1.0|This film is a perfect illustration of why the British film industry shouldn't hire Hollywood mega-stars to prop up their boring scripts.  This is the Downton Abbey of zombie movies.  You feel nothing, and I mean NOTHING for any of the characters in this disaster of a disaster film.  The protaganist's family is the most annoying, useless stage prop I've seen since the \\"Pancakes!\\" kid from Cabin Fever.  I take that back.  At least \\"Pancakes!\\" garnered a head scratch or two.  While we're talking kids, Dakota Fanning in \\"War of the Worlds\\" ain't got nothin' on the wailing daughter riding the shopping cart in this movie.  She SHRIEKS going up stairs, she SHRIEKS going down stairs.  She does nothing but SHRIEK.  Even the zombies were too annoyed to get near her.  It was enough to make you pull your hair out.  Everything about this movie rubbed me the wrong way.  The last 30 minutes of this film was so boring, I started to nod off.  YOU SHOULD NOT BE NODDING OFF WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!!!  World War ZZZZzzzzzzzz...  Please, someone ask Brad Pitt to never act in anything with a CGI budget of less than $10,000.  I can't be the only one who noticed that zombies would randomly disappear from the dogpile (they probably ran out of memory on the 486 computer they used.)  I can see why this bombed in the theaters.  This should be an Amazon Prime freebee.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed the book but was pretty put off by the constant grammatical errors and slight redundancy of the text. If I'm gonna spend $5 on each book in the series, I expect a smoother read. As intrigued as I am to see what happens I will not be continuing the series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this alarm app. Like waking to my favorite song. Would recommend it to anyone. Better than alarm clock. Excellent
B007IV11PM|5.0|although I had some doubts when I heard a new Doctor was coming, I soon found that the story lines and production values were at a level we'd never seen before.  the musical scoring and character development brought catharsis to the Tardis.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good writing and love the Castle its set in. The costumes are very elaborate . The people seem real. So much good vs evil
044022425X|5.0|This whole series- that begins with &#34;Outlander&#34; and continues through to the above title-and on for another 4 titles after it -traces a time traveler 1940's nurse- back to the 1700's wilds of Scotland -just before Culloden- and her becoming the romantic partner of a wild Highlander Lord with flaming red hair- i.e. James Fraser MacKenzie-- a heroic fighter. Multiple overlapping intriques and plots- - incredible writing style reminiscent strongly of the James Mitchner class of bygone writers- Ms. Gabaldon's extremely well written style of historic romantic fiction keeps you literally glued to your seat-page turning constantly- you nearly literally can't put any of the series down!  To add to it - each book is over a THOUSAND&#34; pages long! Most over 1200! I'd give the whole set 12 stars if I could!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read, and - trust me - I have read hundreds of thousands of books over my lifetime.  (I'm 70).  I am excited about the new TV series tht's scheduled to come out next year.  (I would hold my breath til then if it were not detrimental to my health.)  Anyone who reads will be delighted to find these books.

B00CL151G4|5.0|I picked up this show because I was deeply curious what it would be like to see Sherlock Holmes in New York City-- well, that, and I adore Lucy Liu. I went in blind since I'm not much for watching tv as it airs, but based on recommendations from friends I was willing to give it a shot.<br /><br />The cast is excellent and fun, and while it's very much a genre show, that allows for it to focus on character development between the inevitable crimes that are presented to be solved in each episode. Sherlock is, in this interpretation, a recovering drug addict who recently suffered some kind of catastrophic event that sent him spiraling out of control. Watson acts as his sober companion, a temporary associate who is present to help him stay on the horse. As they continue to work together, however, Watson starts developing an eye for case-solving as well, and ends up a bit more involved in the work of deduction than anticipated.<br /><br />Miller's Holmes is enjoyably irritable, off-putting to the people around him and petulant in the extreme. (This exacerbates his slightly more loveable qualities on the rare occasions he is being nicer than he could be if he felt like it.) And Watson, an ex-doctor instead of a war veteran, has secrets to explore as well. One of the best things about the show is that it does not change the relationship between them into a romance; this is still just the story of Sherlock Holmes and his friend Watson, who solve mysteries, fight crime, and go on adventures together.<br /><br />If that's what you're looking for, this show delivers. I'm definitely looking forward to season two!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre does take some liberties with the book, but not in any way that materially affects Bronte's story.  I've seen most versions and have enjoyed them immensely but this one packed more of an emotional wallop for me than any of the others.  Some of the scenes just wowed me, speaking volumes in brief but brilliantly executed vignettes:  - Jane standing on the stool at Lowood for punishment as regimented lines of girls come through, parting to pass on either side of her, no one of them distinguishable in their lockstep uniformity but one of them, unseen and unidentified, surreptitiously pushing a piece of bread into her hand;  - the young Jane's angry, almost defiant strokes as she captures on paper the bleak winter scene of stacked coffins in the Lowood churchyard - and the lovely way this segued into Jane as an adult on a bright Spring day, giving an art lesson to her students;  - Jane's vision of Helen Burns lying dead beneath the religious fresco as Jane is being carried away, and the effective iteration of that vision when a delirious Jane lay down on the moors seemingly ready to die;  - Jane's  solitary outpouring of grief in her bedroom at the Rivers home when she allowed herself to think on the soul-deep contentment she had forever sacrificed by doing the right thing.  This Jane did not seem so stoic, her emotional pain was more real and human even when it was revealed only in her eyes and expression.  Ruth Wilson did an amazing job with the role, capturing the essence of the character, making her more sympathetic and believably susceptible to beguilement.  Toby Stephens was also excellent, showing us a Rochester who was not just melancholy and mercurial, but entertaining and playful and at times heartbreakingly vulnerable.  Rochester's library was a reflection of his younger, blameless self, with its bug specimens and magnifying glasses and the other paraphernalia of a curious, questing mind. You could almost imagine him there as a boy oryoung man, interested in everything and enthusiastically exploring the natural world he inhabited.  It added substance to the character of Rochester portrayed here, who was always describing to Jane the things he'd seen, captivating and beguiling the mind of one who'd had to rely on the occasional book and her imagination to envision the wonders of the world outside her own confined experience.  The brief flashbacks showing how Rochester was enticed by Bertha Mason and betrayed by Celine Varens gave glimpses of his passionate temperament, and the scene where he used that passion to try and convince Jane to stay imbued with a greater sense of urgency her wild, determined flight from the temptation he represented.  Consistent with the book (which was suitably subtle for the time in which it was written) and better than any other version I've seen, this movie conveys how Jane and Rochester were soulmates in every way - not just intellectually and emotionally, but physically as well.  Maybe I'm dense and it just takes me longer to get the overarching moral of a story, but it was only after seeing this version that I really understood one of its fundamental truths.  It wasn't the contrast between St. John's austere sense of duty and Rochester's earthy susceptibility to temptation, that was always evident.  But rather the unnatural and undesirable result of giving ascendance to one facet of our human nature while completely suppressing and disowning another - not all human nature is sinful and selfish, our capacity for selflessness and sacrifice for others can be just as limitless.  St. John may have converted some souls in his missionary work but he was incapable of really caring about his fellow man because he had no compassion for human feeling - like a true stoic, he viewed misery as preordained and any joy in earthly life as almost an affront to God, however innocently derived from a mundane human existence.  Rochester the all-too-human sinner, before Jane, was emotional impulse unfettered.  But St. John the almost inhuman saint was emotional impulse smothered and remorselessly buried in a tomb of impenetrable ice.  There's an appropriately gothic feel to the hallways inside and the wooded pathways outside of Thornfield, the disturbing painting that Sophie always rushed past and the sound of Jane's bedroom door and doorknob rattling. And I especially appreciated the sympathetic treatment of Bertha, who wasn't made to look like a grotesque, unkempt madwoman.  Her final scene was surprisingly enchanting and tragically believable.  The ending of this Jane Eyre was novel perfection - the lightness and color, the spontaneity and camaraderie and especially how it recalled by its complete contrast an earlier scene in the Reed home. With every version I've seen there has been satisfaction that Jane and Rochester were together at last, but it was always tempered by the sad conviction that their happiness must be  diminished to some degree by the cost Rochester had to pay for it. There was no such qualification with this version, the final scenes left me instead with the impression of boisterous joy, not just quiet contentment; and with the satisfying feeling that although Jane and Rochester would spend much of their time happily alone, their lives would also be enriched by their relationships with the worthy, caring people who had shared some part of their journey.
B005LAII4E|2.0|but as a middle age woman this kind of comic book villain story didn't much interest me, I'm just the wrong market (assuming filmmakers are likely mostly targeting pre-teen boys). didn't watch it all the way through. I wasn't feeling well when watching it so my review may not be fair to the story quality. did notice a touch of humor with the little girls and the agents, which was welcome...
B00479SVBU|3.0|Bookmark feature works only sometimes. The device keeps sending you back to the start. Then it won't fast forward two hours into the file. It sends you back to the start, or to the next file in your lineup. I had to break the Audiobook file down into one-hour chunks, then make sure that those files were alone on the USB drive. So now I can make our way through a book, but every hour, when it finishes a \\"track,\\" I have to pull off the road and navigate by hand to the next \\"track\\" in numerical order.<br />It's a huge pain, but I haven't heard of anything else to use.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|pretty standard zombie film with speedy zombies instead of the slow movers. pace was decent, probably the strongest element of the film. acting decent (Brad Pitt is a star for a reason) and everybody did a good job acting-wise as far as I was concerned. two story weaknesses for me were having the Israeli soldier very physically active post-amputation, that was highly unbelievable (this is a zombie film, but still), and also the antidote wasn't believable, but, overall, didn't suck. I turned it off after the amputee was physically able to get Brad Pitt's character to their destination post plane crash, but I was able to return to the story to see the last act.  It could've been worse...
140006922X|5.0|This is a good book for the thoughtful fundamentalist, or others not familiar with the historical-critical method of understanding the development of the Christian faith, since it includes some 64-pages of notes, references and bibliographic citations supporting the the information presented and conclusions drawn in the text. For someone who is more well-read in such material, author Aslan's thinking and conclusions about some things differs significantly from those of other writers (Bruce Chilton, Hyam Maccoby, Jack Spong, etc.) That is to be expected, of course, since much of such material is necessarily conjecture, albeit educated conjecture. The value in reading such differing conclusions and opinions is that probably somewhere in the midst of it lies truths, or something very close to truth. And so, as a contribution to the growing array of such resource material, I commend this effort.
B00BAYLQI0|3.0|found this film emotionally engaging though it wasn't a great film, basically a family experiences a natural disaster and spends the film trying to find each other in the ensuing chaos. I was very concerned for the children and that the family be reunited and they were, so that was good enough for me.  The acting was strong and the director smartly focused on the characters. I didn't know going in what it was about and got to experience the events with the family. Based on a true story.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn was an excellent writer!!!!! He will be so very much missed as well as more books!!!! He is a must read!!! Enjoy!!!!
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I had been looking at this watch online for some time, and finally decided to pull the trigger.<br /><br />The watch is beautiful. I prefer a more classic look, and with all of these huge watches on the market (45mm+), the SKX007K is refreshing in that it is a substantial size without being too big.<br /><br />I love the sweeping second hand. Great buy.
B006RY9AJA|5.0|This was always one of my favorite Ray Harryhausen films. The Jerome Moross score elevates this film from being just another standard fantasy motion picture and transforms it into a Western dinosaur roundup. The setting enhanced by the score and Harryhausen's convincing stop motion creatures really dupes the viewer very subtly into thinking that this Western could have happened. Or almost! The actual valley when first seen by the cowboys has a very unsettling look about it, somewhere between prehistoric and surrealistic. The Jerome Moross score is very reminiscent of his \\"THE BIG COUNTRY,\\" \\"THE PROUD REBEL\\" and \\"THE JAYHAWKERS.\\" The dinosaur work here by Harryhausen ranks among his best. \\"I see what you mean Mister Kirby.\\"
B00DJWV11I|4.0|What a funny, great, funny, light-hearted, did I forget to mention FUNNY read this was. PLEASE tell me Dee-Dee gets her own book!  My only criticism is that even though this book is told from the man's point of view, I found the lengths that he went to for love were not always believable and catered more to what a woman would want in romance, but not what the guy would actually think of doing, let alone actually do! I thoroughly enjoyed the conversational voice in the book, it made all the difference to the enjoyment of the book and added a very refreshing element to the overall experience of reading this wonderful, worthwhile book.
B003R1B9MW|4.0|This is a very well-crafted (lushly crafted, actually) about a working-class American caddie (Shia LaBouef) who went on to win the American Masters (if I recall, I watched the film a while ago). Bill Paxton does a first-rate job as a director, this has many homages to the American Master, Steven Speilberg: lush, sweeping cinematography, soaring music. Good performances all around. Considering it's golf -- not what you call an exciting game -- it's a very engaging movie. Worth watching if you like sports stories -- or even if you don't.

B001D7T6CM|4.0|Excellent dvd period piece of police brutality after World War II in Los Angeles.  This was a time before the civil rights movement. However, our nation, together, on the home front and overseas, fought for a better nation when the war ended.<br />This was  not the case. It was still business as usual. Denzel Washington was outstanding trying to cope with both sides of the law.

0399255370|5.0|The author of this book has done a fabulous job of applying human personalities to each of the crayons.  I particularly love the fact that the yellow and orange crayons are no longer speaking to each other as they each believe they are the color of the sun.  This is a wonderful story of how each of us may feel(e.g. popular, ignored, misunderstood) and it is exemplified by each of the crayons in the box.  A refreshing story that is a real pleasure to read. You will never look at crayons the same again.
B007HO392S|5.0|Awesome CD, if you like Carrie Underwood, this is a great album! I just love the songs and recommend highly!

B00BJENK62|2.0|I didn't have the highest expectations for this book, having already been sorely disappointed by Lonely Planet's South East Asia guide. What swung me toward giving Lonely Planet the benefit of the doubt was that this title was billed as being recently published. That might be the case, but it simply means the existing info in it has been updated to correct prices or addresses, rather than the whole thing having been overhauled. Read the blurb about the contributors and you can see why: none has spent significant amounts of time exploring the country (I'm sorry, but a few weeks here and there, adding up to only a few months in total, does not cut it.) Read their effusive thanks to the publisher for having selected them for the job in the first place, and it's clear that even they were surprised they got the job.<br /><br />What's lacking? Depth and options. There's a lack of the former in background descriptions and commentaries. And in terms of options, you get a strong sense that the few eating or accommodation establishments that they list for each place are not the best available for each price range, but simply the only ones they tried.<br /><br />I do sympathise. I'm a publisher myself, so I know exactly how difficult it is to produce good quality content with the meagre budgets available these days. But now, writing with my reader hat on, my feedback to other readers and potential buyers is that this title has very little value. Unfortunately.
B005P4P966|5.0|this has been a great season of this show. the evolution of amy and sheldon's relationship has been very interesting. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B0041KYLAU|1.0|i didn't realize that this dvd is not compatible with machines made in canada. i am unable to watch it on my dvd player.
0770437400|5.0|I usually have to sympathize with a story's protagonist in some way to really be captivated by (and frankly, to finish) a book. This book doesn't have one. Many of the characters are only \\"interviewed\\" once. When I heard Brad Pitt was playing \\"the lead\\" I was like, \\"what lead?\\" Having still not invested the time/money in the movie, my review is based entirely on the book. I loved it. I thought it was creative and engaging. Not having a defined storyline and characters might have been an obstacle for me in a longer book, but it's a quick, engaging read that some people will finish in a sitting.<br /><br />The first person accounts of a recently endured war reminded me of the real-life soldier interviews from the show The Pacific which isn't especially unique for a documentary, but is (to my knowlege) in the zombie fiction drama. As goofy as the premise may be, it still somehow resounds emotionally. Maybe I held it to a lower literary standard because of its genre. If I'd bought the version with bonafide pages instead of just the pixelated illusion, I could have debated that point with anyone willing to borrow my copy. I might buy the paperback just to that end.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Even though it may feel a bit camp, this film somehow manages to strike the right notes.  It's not just that Errol Flynn plays Robin as a man having so much fun, but other cast members give equally delicious performances, especially Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains having a great time as the villains.  It's a cl;assic.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|love this game it is so much fun and I think it is a super fun game and I think anyone that likes card games would love this game.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|I purchased this book because I like mysteries that have a bit of humor in them. I don't go for the graphic, gory stuff. I also want a story that is well crafted and keeps me turning the pages.<br /><br />Whitehead's novel started with an intriguing first chapter, but then slowed right down for most of the book. I only kept reading to see if it would get better and to see how that first chapter had anything to do with the droll stuff I was reading. Finally, things came together when I was about three-fourths of the way through the book. That's a long time to wait for a book to get good.<br /><br />But it got good and everything resolved in a clever way.<br /><br />I did not find it as funny as it was promoted to be, which was a disappointment. The book wasn't &#34;deep&#34; by any means. But it was a good book for light reading.
B000FC10WU|5.0|The Body In The Library is one of my favorite Christies', and I love all of them, tho I choke a bit at her blatant racism and anti-semitism, as well as contempt for the \\"Lower Orders\\" (servants, etc. who, BTW NEVER are even suspected as murderers, although I bet in Real Life a lot of rich jerks were DONE IN by the help) in her earlier books. Its startling but gives one an idea of how everyday people thought of \\"others\\" whether religion, race, economic class, or \\"personality type\\".<br /><br />A lot of the fun of reading Christie is the feeling of plunging into another universe, perhaps one based on reality, but not really real. I enjoy re-reading them knowing who the murderer(s) are and seeing if I can spot the clues this time around.<br /><br />I've noticed the Kindle books have not beed edited as most of the US published paperbacks I read (1075-current) have been. Hence the occasional startling racist comments, or the implication that one character loves money because he has a semitic nose, while the (non semitic) murder actually did the deed for- money! Not much anti feminism though,the female characters aren't too terribly stereotyped.<br /><br />\\"Body In The Library\\" is at the top of my list, along with \\"The Pale Horse\\"  and \\"Secret of Chimneys\\".  I'd say \\"The Pale Horse\\" is her best, though.

B00BI73CVI|4.0|I was very impressed with the vocal talents of some of the actors in this movie.  I adore the musical and this novel is my absolute favorite.  I've read it twice.  The reason I did not give it five stars is this: the musical is best viewed as a stage performance.  Trying to put a work of this scope into a movie format, and squeeze it into even two hours is just not enough.  If you are going to put it on film, then you need to make it in several parts and cover it as close to the original novel as possible.  Otherwise, casual viewers will not (and did not in the case of my family) understand what was going on, and how very significant EVERYTHING was to the time the story was written.  Film gives you the potential to really put a work of this magnitude into context and give due diligence to the characters and plot.  The original musical takes many liberties with the story line due to time restrictions because they are performing in  front of a live audience, but the film version has the ability to truly portray this novel in all its brilliance and genius.  They did it with Lord of the Rings, and the same care and attention should be devoted to this masterpiece.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|This show, to my mind, is the anti-Twilight.  The familiar elements are there (young and oh so telegenic witches, lycans and vampires), The writing is MUCH better than the aforementioned movies.  The acting is also of a higher caliber.  A low bar to clear, admittedly.<br /><br />It's just good escapist fun.  If you like Buffy, Angel and Orphan Black, you'll enjoy this.
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|Probably the most charming  movie we have ever watched.  That it is, thankfully, so non-Hollywood is quite refreshing. We bought one for the family cabin also.

B000OVLINI|5.0|This author introduces and interweaves characters, time periods and plots with great skill.  The story line drew me in from the opening scene to the very end.  I could hardly wait to get to our Book Club gathering to hear others' viewpoints - we strongly agreed that we want to read more of Carlos Ruiz Zafron's books and are excited that a prequel has been published.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finally got the book that came so highly recommended, and I was never so bored with a book! It's like every other porno ever written, and if  you've read one, you've read them all. I forced myself to read a little further each time I opened it, and made it to 32%. I couldn't stand anymore, and gave up on it. I hate to think that I spent 7$ for that! Don't waste your money or your time.

014241493X|5.0|Wonderful, compelling story, keeps the reader intrigued. Fans of Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines will immediately recognize Green's personification of his characters for both come together seamlessly in Paper Towns. With all the allure and interest of an unattainable, crazy young woman that Alaska has, as well as the poignancy of growing up from Katherines. It's wonderful and suspenseful, and definitely worth it for young adult lovers who adore coming of age novels.
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|Broadchurch starts out a bit slow but quickly comes up to speed.  Each of the characters are people who I could easily identify with.  I love the normal everyday look of the homes and the people.  The story line is interesting, it lets you in on the family lives of the characters and their connections to the victim and keeps you guessing to the very end.  All in all, I would have to say it is well written, well acted and even the musical score is just right.  I can't wait for the next one.  I certainly hope they keep the same caliber of realistic and believable actors and setting. If the BBC can put out a program as good as this I may just have to subscribe to the BBC/America channel on cable just to see what else is out there. A very REFRESHING change from what is offered here in the US of A.......
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When i first downloaded the game i thought it was boring. Like it was just like temple run but then i saw a kid playing a level on it which looked like a neighbourhood. So i downloaded and updated and the graphics were AMAZANG!!!!!! EACH LEVEL HAS ITS OWN BOSS THIS GAME IS BETTER THEN TEMPLR RUN AND ON PAR WITH SUBWAY SURFER BUY THE GAME
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|love the game. keep up the good work.  I have enjoyed the G5 games that I could afford thanks for making this one affordable :)
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I fell in love right away.  This series grabs you and you just can't stop watching it.  I couldn't stop until I had finished watching the entire series.
0345803485|5.0|OMG couldn't put the book down. I started reading it at the airport waiting for my flight and made it through more than half of the book.  It was a great read and super HOT!
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|I was a little confused whether this was a child's book where the writer was told to grow up or not. I did like the conclusion and summary but at times it reminded me of the Secret Seven child's novels.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is awesome..brings out my competitive side.wish there were faster refills.. to addicting to only get two hands every twenty min.
B005NAE04E|3.0|After reading The Ocean at the End of the Street, I thought I might give Neverwhere a read. I wish I had chosen something else.
B004B8DH98|2.0|I thought this would be an exciting spy flick.  Instead, it seemed to be an excuse for George Clooney to write off a long Italian vacation.  About as un-compelling a story as could be produced.  Only action is in the first 5 minutes and last five minutes... unless you're just looking for nudity, which is sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />Disappointing.
B001F0ET9M|1.0|My rating is based ONLY on the fact that neither of the 2 discs would play on my sony Blu-ray player. The movie itself is pretty good. You would be better off to purchase it on regular dvd.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Although Play Store says this is for tablets only, it seems to work great on my Galaxy S4 installed through amazon app store. Good fun, nice interface.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Thu  was  such a great book! I can't wait until th  next one comes out.  Rick Riordan is even coming to my city!
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I have tested out this app and it seems amazing. Although they don't have the languages I want. Please add more (Japanese, Chinese, Mandarin) and this app will be awesome
B002CIMKHO|5.0|We loved this movie. Walt was a great character who made us laugh at times and hold our breath at other times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i could not put the book down, i read it very quickly. I enjoyed the details in every page. Movie does it no justice.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Have to get it in High Definition to see the impact of special effects.<br />Great movie and waiting for the next one.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Excellent, refreshingly substantial!<br /> Such meaningful lyrics from such a young voice....this baby boomer's spirit was touched! So good to be able to understand.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A well done reboot of the longest running sci-fi series on THIS planet! Pick up where it all begins, and get yourself hooked!
B000050WZY|5.0|This album needed to be listened to on vinyl record as it was originally heard back in the day. Thank you for releasing this on a double 180gram vinyl record for us purists! Long live the Beatles!
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  It was a real page turner.  Dan Brown really hit the mark.
B009NT0I06|5.0|Great album from Swift. In fact one that shows her expertise in her song writing.<br />Great album alone but I bought the vinyl copy as well and its sound quality trumps the CD version I have!
B00422LESO|4.0|It was a fun story, and I really enjoyed the little winks she gave for true Austen fans. Would highly recommend it.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book was funny and sweet, I enjoyed every moment. I enjoyed the perspective it was written from. Thank you!
B00632HWOG|4.0|It does what it is suppose to do, I have no complaints about it, it is a good app that checks yahoo email.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My daughter chose this book for summer reading prior to her sophomore year.  The moment she finished it, she asked to download the audio version, so the entire family could experience it together.  Soon, her sister and I had to confess to reading ahead on our own!  I loved this book.  Keep them coming, John.  OK?
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|one of the best TV series I have seen for a long time.Season one was also terrific,looking forward to season three!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Adorable sweet romance.<br /><br />Megan wakes up the day after her cousins bachelorette party, yep, married.  And her groom doesn't want to get a divorce.  But maybe getting a divorce isn't the worst thing in the world.  I mean he is kind of cute!<br /><br />I loved this one and am looking forward to Harlequin's new line of books.  The covers are fun and exciting and can't wait to read them!<br /><br />This was a quick easy read, these books are a great option for a week at the beach or a night curled up in front of the fire!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The entertainment value is extreme!  How many superlatives does it take to express it correctly?  A series like this only comes along every generation.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|would definately recommend this game to everyone and anyone of all ages. I originally started this game on the Pc and now playing on the kindle. i absolutely love this game.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Fairly small car charger. Charges two phones. Pretty basic.<br />Charges my phone fairly quickly on my car but might be different for you depending on your car's electrical output.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I wish there was more than one song by Garret but it is still a great album! Worth the money and I got the cd and it into my cloud player, no need to download the cd to my computer I got the mp3 download right away then the cd came two days later!
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|Why  do you make it  so stupid. I was going to put it down, but it got interesting then it  got boring. Dorothy had red shoes not silver ones. They didn't adventure through the forest at the end or the kingdom of the winkies, or the field mice. So make a better book that goes with the movie
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is awesome! It's a little violent, but still very good. I bet you've read the tale already. But I think you'll like it too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was surprised over and over again while reading this book. So many twists and turns. Then I found myself teared up at the end.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I've watched all of this series shows but wanted to be able have a couple seasons at my finger tips. The show is a must see. Funny as can be.
B00E00OGE2|5.0|My friend and i love animated films-nevermind were both past 30! And suffering as i do from on-again off-again nerves and depression i just havent been drawn to alot of the more \\"grownup\\" movies. And little snails are one of my favorite creatures as theyre so helpless and really very cute! This movie touched on this in a way most kids and adults hopefully can relate to. And the common theme of dreaming big is brought back in a very original way!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. The characters were very well written and relatable. They felt like people I knew. The story was also extremely touching. I don't want to write too much about the story because it is better read without knowing too much, but I will say that I highly recommend this book!
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Very recomendable with the mobo ASRock Socket FM2/AMD A75, Sapphire Radeon HD 6570 1GB DDR3 and Kingston Hyper X Blu 8 GB (2x4GB Modules) 1600MHz, it's very smooth and strong, I was asking if i did a good choise, and yes, it's very good for a this kind of pc, also a good price for his quality!<br /><br />very recommendable
B001I45UFC|5.0|I love all of these books, so I bought all of them when they were on sale for ridiculously cheap. Delivered right to my kindle wirelessly, no problems even when I was in Argentina!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|THIS is a most interesting game. It is fun and makes one think. I must admit I think it is wonderful that you have help in the game. I do think it would be beneficial to give additional instructions to explain the game.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I am very sorry for what Piper has been through this was a great read I read it in one sitting from MO to AR and back to MO and I couldn't put it down.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|this is fun but it is also confusing but all in all I like it.. cant wait.to play somemore. good job
B002VECLVO|5.0|I love Colin Firth, but knew him only from the classics (Pride and Prejudice) or comedies (Bridget Jones Diary aso).<br />This is not only deeply moving, but full of poetry, beauty and humanity. I think it's my favorite up to now.<br />Homosexuality is not always easy to understand for &#34;straight&#34; people and far too often linked to sheer vulgarity.<br />This is completely different, and a true love story. Not verbose, not one word too much. Almost self explanatory.
B009DH2PP4|1.0|I'm new to the world of home brewing and got the Kindle edition of this book (over The Complete Joy of Homebrewing based on a negative review of it).  In the beginning of the book the author shows a few pictures but doesn't do a good job pointing out which items are which. I had a hard time following the brewing process (for example, if the bucket or the glass carboy was used for fermentation).  What was really bothersome was the jumping from subject to subject (sometimes within the same paragraph) and not moving sequentially (for example in talking about sugars, he moves from the description of one to a six carbon sugar and then back to the two and three carbon sugars).  He also used terms that are not explained (for example the use of \\"lauter tun\\" in the First Wort Hopping section).  As a beginner I need concepts simply explained, in a linear fashion, with well defined terms.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying the Mr. Beer Deluxe Edition Home Microbrewery System to get hands-on experience running a simple brewing system.  And I'll probably get a copy of the The Complete Joy of Homebrewing after all.
B002ZG980U|3.0|All the actors are more than good. Special effects are breathtaking and the plot is quite interesting.<br />But some scenes (for example all those shot &#34;in the snow&#34;) are far too long. You almost loose the thread and interest in<br />the plot. But it's creative, makes you think, and love architecture...
B009K0P10K|5.0|Can't wait for the next season.  Great characters, great plots, Great modern day adult soap opera.  Love that I can watch commercial free.
B000HXDM0U|5.0|Very interesting from GB politic's ways of beeing, doing, deciding, and so on.<br />Extremely funny and sarcastic. The script writers have atually been employed afterwards as speech writers for real politicians.<br />It reminds you of how small we are, and how unsignificant, but also clever sometimes.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Move aside all you wannabes! There is a new pop princess leading the pack and who knew it would be Nickelodeon star Ariana Grande.<br /><br />Ariana's voice takes center stage on the majority of the totally radio friendly tracks. Of course, there is the mega-hit \\"The Way\\" and \\"Baby I\\", but she also runs the gamut with a variety of other styles including a 60's doo-wop influenced \\"Tattooed Heart\\", Broadway sampled \\"Popular Song\\" (from \\"Wicked\\" with guest artist Mika), a Boyz II Men tinged duet \\"Almost is Never Enough\\" with rumored boyfriend Nathan Skyes of The Wanted, along with an assortment of up-tempo tunes like \\"You'll Never Know\\" and \\"Right There\\" which honors her obvious influence to Mariah Carey. It's one thing to be an influence, but totally another to be able to hit those notes, and Ariana does it with Grande-ness.<br /><br />Jump on the bandwagon with this album and you definitely will not be disappointed... especially when she wins a Grammy this year for \\"Best New Artist\\". All hail Princess Ariana!
B005I57NZ2|5.0|I am a programmer myself (first freeware, now open-source) and I really like the anecdotes and encouraging examples found in this book.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Have read and reread this story. Weber is a craftsman with the sub-plots and story lines. Needs to be part of the curriculum for Honorverse devotes. I recommend it.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Love this show.  This is something both my husband and I enjoy and love getting the last series prior to the new one starts so we can watch and it will be fresh in our minds just prior to the new series starting.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Best app for my Kindle. Terrific graphics. And all the info anyone could ask for. It would be perfect if the barometer function showed the current readings for my city area.
031623480X|5.0|Dr. Perlmutter's new book, Grain Brain, discusses a topic that has been an area of much interest to me as a neuroscientist and nutritional researcher. The book is not meant to be an indepth scientific discussion of the topic and as with many of Dr. Perlmutter's books this book is designed to translate this difficult science into a form that will be meaningful to the average reader. I know the author personally and can testify that he understands the scientific mechanisms intimately. He cites a great number of well conducted clinical, epidemiological studies that clearly make the case for his assertions and resulting advice for his readers. One of the main themes of the book is that at the bottom of a great many neurological disorders lies inflammation and this is being confirmed daily by a growing number of well-conducted studies from major laboratories the world over. Gluten/gliaden, excess simple carbohydrates and improper oils are major triggers for brain inflammation. The real importance of this book is that these three major nutritional issues have been generally ignored by the orthodox medical profession and these again are: the neurotoxic effects of gluten/gliaden in a great number of individuals, the harmful effects of excessive lowering of brain cholesterol levels and the harmful effects of simple carbohydrate excess on the brain. As the author points out, these three items are all radically altered in those eating a typical Western diet and the obsession with lowering blood cholesterol is harmful to the brain. In clinical medicine the diseases most often overlooked are the ones associated with multiple signs and symptoms involving many areas of the body.Most physicians will tell such patients that their problem is psychological and due to stress. As a result many end up on psychotropic medications for decades before a real diagnosis is made. To say that I agree with everything in the book would be deceptive, since those knowledgeable about such complicatedfields of study often have minor disagreements. For example, I disagree with some of the recipe ingredients. Yet, overall the advice given is sound. This is a valuable book that can save many people a lot of misery.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book was an easy but at times emotional read. I was interested from the first page till way after I had finished the book but there were a few points in the book where my interest for the characters waned a little. Still a good book and a really touching story.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I downloaded to my kindle, and I don't really know if it is my kindle or I just don't know how to use it.  It doesn't seem to work well with the kindle.  I tried to play it, got frustrated quickly and quit.  At least it was free....
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This item is perfect for my iPhone, but does not seem to work for my hand held device (luckily, I don't need it too! I am very happy with this. It is a lifesaver at times when the phone battery goes low.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I don't know what it is, or why I have it and don't really care to find out.  I think it downloaded when I was trying to do something and it didn't help what I was doing.  I'll probably delete it eventually.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The creativity in these characters MAKES this movie!<br />Just like the penguins in Madagascar, the minions do for Despicable Me!<br />They provide a range of wonderful emotions and they do it with out saying a discernible sentence!<br />A GREAT movie for the entire family.
B000002MK8|5.0|Love the rawness of live music and this album shows a quality of his voice that isn't there in others.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|It is a really sharp, original, simple watch and I really like wearing it!  Two drawbacks, however: the source of power and the strap.  I wasn't familiar with the &#34;Seiko 5&#34; power source.  I would've recognized it if it was still call &#34;Seiko Kinetic&#34;.  I used to have a &#34;Seiko Kinetic&#34; watch - a really nice, gold one.  However, I didn't like to wear it on a day-to-day basis; I wanted to reduce wear on the watch.  If you don't wear it on a regular basis, though, the battery dies and every time you want to wear it again, you have to set the time and date.  I would like this watch better if it had a steady battery.  I wouldn't mind changing the battery once in a while, but having to reset the date and time a lot is a pain.  Also, I have a big wrist and the strap is way too short.  Other than those two drawbacks, the watch is great!
B005OHSD3A|1.0|My labs got much worse on this radical diet.  It can ruin your kidneys and arteries.  Beware. Losing weight is great, but not at the expense of your long-term health!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|The writing is good.  The acting is great.  The over dramatic story line caught me from the beginning.  The dark humor kept me hooked.  Not to mention that Charlie Hunnam is the epitome of hot bad boy.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I enjoyed watching all the special features and the film was great because it was the extended edition.  The music is awesome.  I am a musician and enjoy beautiful soundtracks.<br /><br />I bought the series of Lord of the Rings films to watch while recovered from surgery.  I am glad I did.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It reminds me so much of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with his zany descriptions and dry humor.  I would recommend this book to any slightly geeky Douglas Adams admirer or anyone who likes British humor.  Excellent.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I have read this book several times. I have a mentor much like Morrie and she has made such an impression in my life. This is a good book for an important life lesson. I urge you to read Tuesday's With Morrie to remind yourself what kind of people we should be.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows on TV!  If you haven't watched it, you really should.  We have purchased all the seasons, and preorder when possible ( it's cheaper!).  All around great comedy with a fantastic cast.  Can't get any better than The Big Bang Theory!
0425263924|5.0|Eva's mom is up to her old tricks again. Gideon is just as irritable as always. And Sylvia Day has made me want to jump in the book and be a part of the story.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|If you haven't seen the Toy Story series, I recommend buying all three and having a marathon with your children!  Thins will keep them entertained foe a few hours.  It's a very enjoyable film.  My 2 grandsons were watching them when they were 2 and loved all of them, and still do!
B00932A4XE|5.0|the movie was funny in all degrees of laughter...i loved cameron diaz's character...jlo's character i didn't like so much, i wanted to see more from her
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is fun. i would recommend getting it. its challanging but fun. can't stop playing it.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this movie this much. This movie had me on the edge of my seat 80% of the time.
B00F35BV64|3.0|a  not as good as I expected, with unknown actors a very poor story line, they have to do better
B001VTTRC6|4.0|A movie that kept my interest the whole time.  It was a sad movie so would not recommend watching it when you are depressed.  Good picture and sound quality.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|You should get this cause it is fun you shouldn't get it cause u can't find a word quickly so I rate 2 star
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Good picture and sound quality.  It has Patrick Swayze starring in it so of course I liked it a lot.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|Very good quality and sound. Keeps very good track of episode updates. My only complaint is that some of the episodes of the podcasts I listen to are not playable.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Would be great but very frustrating having to wait constantly to recharge energy or buy more and having to do same levels over n over sucks
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This is a commercial product for today's generation of morons who don't know what a story is, have no attention span, and who just want to be glitzed by rapid-editing and tinsily colorful images that look enthralling when you're on ecstacy.  This is film-making at it's worst, and a person would have to be a total idiot to want to sit through it.  It's like taking \\"Hamlet\\" and making it into a musical written by JayZ or \\"Little Wayne.\\"  Pure garbage that's such a crime against storytelling that the creator should be hauled before the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Kate Morton, but it won't be the last!  I didn't want to put this one down.  She kept the suspense high and I was eager to find out how all of the pieces would come together.  I wasn't disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Have enjoyed it for hours. Just wish some of the special minions didn't cost so many coins. Also game gets really fast after a while. More levels and more minions please.
140006922X|5.0|First let me say all those nay Sayers giving this book low rating seem to have an agenda.  I read this book and I could not put it down.  I am not an avid reader by any means, but this book was well written and kept my intersect all the way.  It is so wonderful the way the author looks at roman traditions and if and how it jives with the bible.  Its also gives you a wonderful understanding of life 2000 years ago in Jerusalem.  The way the author compares James, Paul and other writings about Jesus and puts them in historic content is also wonderful.  I am not a religious man, but I love history and this book was wonderful.....
B0047WJ11G|5.0|Loved it!<br />I think that it had a great premise, the acting was great too. I've seen it several times and keep watching.
1451624468|5.0|Breaking down some of mankind's greatest remaining questions, Krauss is able to provide an instantly engrossing guide as he walks us back to the beginning of everything, before matter, before space, before time. &#34;Nothing&#34; has never been so marvelous.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Good plot, great cast, the movie isn't what I expected and it didn't drag on. My wife usually falls asleep during movies. Stayed up for this one
B003YFIUW8|5.0|As a mom of a small child this book really took me by the heartstrings. At times gut-wrenching and at other times remarkably beautiful. I read it in 24 hours - just couldn't stand not knowing what was going to happen. It certainly made me hug my little one a little tighter and value my happy life a little more.
B009O07NMA|5.0|love this group
B00E95ED32|5.0|I was never a big an electro dance pop person but I fell in Love with \\"Wake Me Up\\" so I purchased Avicii's new album. I received my \\"True\\" album today and I can't stop playing this terrific album. In fact, I think that I'll get a second one to have one at home and one in my car. Here's how I rated the tracks:<br /><br />Wake Me Up = 10<br />You Make Me = 8<br />Hey Brother = 10<br />Addicted To You = 10<br />Dear Boy = 8.5<br />Liar, Liar = 9.5<br />Shame On Me = 10<br />Lay Me Down = 10<br />Hope There's Someone = 10<br />Heart On My Sleeve = 10<br /><br />If you haven't bought the album yet, I highly recommend \\"True\\". It's a great mix of varied songs and styles.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We always enjoy movies based off of true stories.  This movie definitely tugs at your heart.  We purchase movies that we feel we can enjoy in years to come.  Well worth it!!!!
B000K4X5XA|1.0|Watched it only 1 time in the last 3 years and when the little one wanted to watch it, it comes up with invalid disc. tried several times, no luck. The disc itself is spotless. There are many comments about this issue on net.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book in the Hunger Games trilogy. I felt a twist in the characters and it's plot yet it was not what I expected as you get deeper into the Capitol's sinister game of life.  I thought these stories were meant for young adults, as it turned out it touches everyone across the board because it is a story about human pain and suffering seen  through the eyes of a young girl forced to grow up and become a symbol of freedom for her town..
B00A85EMVK|2.0|The language isn´t spanish, it´s mexican language and it´s not the same, the box says spànish and the voice listen very diferent
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|This is my favorite angry birds game so far. There's been lots of reviews about how great the sound is, but the music is mostly the same on every level. I tried to watch one of the videos on toon TV, but then the game froze and I can't get it to open. I know Rovio just released it, so I'm hoping for an update to fix it... If that's fixed, than I'll gladly change the rating to five stars.<br /><br />I have a Kindle Fire, by the way.
B00APYUPB0|5.0|excellent re-issue and specially the enhanced audio is superb. the artwork is at the highest quality; sound is crisp and video although short is a must the serious IQ fan and collector. highly reccomended! oh and audio rememberances by mike holmes and peter nichols are enjoyable to say the least,
B004BQRNBS|5.0|These episodes are very good. The actors playing the main characters (Elizabeth & Mr Darcy) are very good & believable in their roles. The cinematography & script are true to the period in which the original book was written. I must say that the writers followed the book quite well. A delightful display indeed! :D
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|A very engaging series. We recommend it to all of our friends. Even our grandchildren love it. Keep it coming!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Love  the book, didn't have very many problems with it at all and the unpredictable storyline kept me reading for hours
B009JZWO3I|3.0|why Alicia is still married to that man is beyond me. Disappointing how nothing has changed since season 3; I was hoping for more.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed the first book in the series but felt it was too full of WWI minutiae which slowed,down the story.  This one, however, is much better paced.  I have enjoyed the character development and feel as if they are now old friends.  Unfortunately, the next book in the series doesn't come out until next year.  As much as I read, I will have forgotten them by then and have to reconnect.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Love this book. Keeped me wanting to read more. It was hard to put down.  I love reading books from this author.
0525478817|5.0|It was for my daughter and she loved it. Would recommend the book.<br />A great book to read. Just great.
0385743564|5.0|This is the best book about super-heros I have ever read. Granted, that might not be saying too much considering how few I've read (Soon I Will Be Invincible was my former favorite). That said, am a retired DC Universe Fanatic and somewhat well-versed in the Marvel Continuum. That is to say I once spent around $300.00 per month on comics and now only occasionally have a relapse where I buy a trade paperback... But more than that, you should know where I stand on Sanderson...<br /><br />I've met Sanderson in person. I've got plenty of people into his books. I tell everyone who will listen to read The Stormlight Archive. I  again started reading (and bought every book of) The Wheel of Time SPECIFICALLY because Sanderson was finishing the series. While everyone else was reading for Jordan, I started reading from the second book on because of SANDERSON (and subsequently got hooked on Jordan along the way). I own:The Way of Kings, Mistborn Trilogy, Alloy of Law, Warbreaker, The Emperor's Soul, and EVERY Wheel of Time book. I downloaded Firstborn. I read Legion. I am OBSESSED with Sanderson. I tell you all this as fair warning so you can move on to another review if you think my promoting of Sanderson is annoying.<br /><br />The other night I had a conversation with my wife about Sanderson. My wife said he's going to be better than J.R.R. Tolkien. I said \\"He has the POTENTIAL to be better than Tolkien.\\" I've heard people call him a hack. I've heard people say his writing has no style. I've read reviews where people say all his books are the same, that his stories are formulaic. These people...are wrong.<br /><br />If you've read Sanderson's other books then you are doubtless familiar with his style. He writes plot and world-building like nobody's business. When he tells you something magical just happened, he didn't draw pull a rabbit out of a hat or say the magic words. There was a darn good SCIENTIFIC reason why what just happened worked...within the world that he created. People CANNOT defy the laws of physics in a Sanderson story, they just obey the laws of the universe he has created. The stories Sanderson creates have common themes. A hero overcoming impossible odds to free the world. A young person growing into an adult in a world gone mad. Wise old friends instructing them and training them to become a hero. Does this make all his books the same??? No! No!! NO!!!<br /><br />Sanderson is growing as a writer, improving with every book he writes. He is exploring different styles one by one. He did young adult with the Alcatraz series, and now he is writing to an older teen audience. His protagonist talks self-depreciatingly (a bit like Alcatraz), his world is a nightmare universe (a bit like Mistborn), there is a strong female pseudo-love-interest rear-kicking female (yeah, Megan is LOT like Bastille, again from the Alcatraz series). Is Abraham a bit like Sazed from Mistborn? Yes. Is the Prof a bit like Kelsier from the same series? Yes. BUT!!!! This does NOT make them the same book!!!<br /><br />This Book is Awesome<br /><br />There are a few places where this books drags a tad. The plot is simple. The characters are archetypes. And none of that is a bad thing. If the action didn't let you breath now and then the book would be too intense. If the plot were too complex it would distract from the characters. And the archetypes... People seem to have a REALLY hard time these days telling the difference between an archetype and a stereotype. Do yourself a favor and go to the TV Tropes Website and look up \\"Tropes Are Tools\\". I'll wait. Done? Good. Sanderson writes his stories the way a painter paints his paintings. Do you criticize Van Gogh for piling on the paint in every painting? No? Why? It's because HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. I've often said that I don't mind hearing the same story forever, as long as each time, the story is told WELL.<br /><br />This book depicts superheroes in a brand new way (I've never seen anything quite like it). It gives even the villains a deeper reason for what they do than simply \\"Because they are EVIL. MWAHAHAAA!!!\\" It gives the REAL heroes internal struggles, and character flaws. The action sequences are breath-taking (like all of Sanderson's action). The technology is fun and exciting. You CARE about the characters. And the REAL plot, which lies beneath the surface (Why are there no good Epics? Why is Megan so mean to David? Why doesn't the Prof use his own technology?) culminates in a classic Sanderson ending where all comes to light in plot twists that you never saw coming.<br /><br />Is this the best book Sanderson has ever written? No, that would be The Way Of Kings. Does it has the greatest action sequences and Crowning Moments of Awesome (No that would be the Mistborn series). But it IS darn good!!! As an origin story (for the protagonist) it does a darn good job of weaving an incredibly entertaining yarn. It's unsettling (the intro where innocent people are massacred by Epics is bone-chilling), inspiring (The GOOD Epics WILL come!!!), and above-all ENTERTAINING.<br /><br />Plus, it has a lot of great comic book references if you are looking for them (What are the initials of the protagonist and the initials of the insurance company mentioned?).<br /><br />I jumped out of my skin when I was able to get a pre-release copy of this book and can't wait to get Sanderson to sign it. I will pre-order the sequel as soon as it becomes available. Sanderson is already the greatest living Fantasy writer on Earth, and he's only getting better with each book he writes. I look forward to seeing where he takes all of his series from here. I know my faith will be rewarded, and this is only the beginning.ike it).

B008KUBH0Y|5.0|It was for my daughter and she loved it. Would recommend the book.<br />A great book to read. Just great.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Sure it's neat, but the amount of options I have feels extremely limited. More-so than I would expect. It's still a great game and with some creativity,anything can be made, but... Just feels a little bit off.
B009RX85N0|5.0|the stories are better than the first season and I thought the first season was great. an excellent series with great characters and stories. ssuperb acting.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|Can do jsut about everything you can on the site, just more condensed., Only problems I ran into were because of the device I was using. You can't chat and watch while using a Kindle Fire, however on iDevices,it works wonders. I hope this problem is fixed on the HDs or later versions of the Fire for other peoples' sake.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I loved it. Hope Emily Thorne and Jack get together and raise that baby. They belong together. Sorry Decklyn had to die
B000FCKPHG|2.0|1 chapter is enough to avoid the rest of the book . It was a good chapter though. Thank you.
B00AO3K01C|5.0|This book has earned a well-deserved place on the short list of the Booker-Mann prize for 2013.<br />It is a sensitive, imaginative, and unusual story.

B00DQBWLSO|5.0|A variation in style, but the same quality we've grown to expect from John Mayer.  Excellent writing, playing, singing and production.

B004ZH66XO|2.0|I got this game while it was the FAotD, and I must say I played it for all of 2 minutes before boredom took over and I uninstalled. The goal of the game is to swim around as a fish, avoiding fish bigger than you and eating fish smaller than you. You start off in a jar of water, a boring jar, and there is only one type of fish to eat. This game, since it is a paid app normally, should offer a bit more from the start. Also, I find it important to note, the game asks if the player prefers the tilt-to-move or joystick method of moving, then tells you how you can change it if you change your mind. But it doesn't remember your response, and so every minute it asked me again and again to make the same choice. The popup during play is VERY annoying and took away any miniscule enjoyment I might've had for the game.<br /><br />There are games just like this one (fish eating fish) that are far better than this one. Don't waste any more time here.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is my new favorite show. Kudos to writers for keeping it sharp. The actors are amazing. and the clothes...oh my!
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|The use of modern music was annoying.  DiCaprio was alright.  Alltogether, it is just a horrible story that is better read than played.
B00A285OOW|1.0|I found this last installment in the series relentlessly dreary & depressing. I enjoyed the previous four volumes, but this one lacked the energy, spark and power of the others. The title character seems to play absolutely no part in her own life. She does not act but is merely acted upon, quite unlike the characters Gregory created in the preceding novels. In my humble opinion, read the first four and forget this one.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We got this to use with an umbrella stroller that didn't have a cup holder.  It goes on easy and works well with many cups and it's nice to have a place to put the garage door opener or keys when going on walks.<br /><br />The top of the caddy has a wire that runs through it which can be easily shaped or deformed as necessary to adapt to cups or allow the stroller to fold up or expand.<br /><br />The one issue with this caddy is that when it is attached to your stroller and you fold the stroller up, the velcro loops can slide down over the joints that allow the stroller to open and close making it difficult to re-open the stroller without first sliding the caddy back up.  Once you realize this can happen it's not that big of a deal.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It's a simple tale an easy read which touches the heart....sensitive, very thought provoking, an enjoyable read.<br />The characters young, narrative clean and fresh, enjoyed it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Learn th truth and who really runs the food industry.  Heart wrenching accounts of how our system works, or doesn't as the case may be.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I purchased it on my Kindle Fire and it never shows up in my library. It's been months, so I've come to the conclusion that it isn't compadible. I probably wiated too long for a refund, but it really shouldn't be sold in the Amazon App store if it lacks functionality with Amazon's own tablet.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is very addictive!!! Lots of hidden pictures to search and puzzles to solve but u have to pay to buy food for energy to advance.  I have spent a ton of money and am on level 45 and it is currently kind of stale. I have reached the highest level on all epics but 1. the story has stalled and the searches are beginning to get boring. kind of a waste if about $400 so far. I'm an idiot.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I bought this as a daily deal not expecting anything. A great read. Surprising storyline. Likable characters.  Supernatural superheroes living in a quiet little town
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie has a good goofy plot, and good character generation. It was a little predictable so no 5 stars. But the kids and I could watch it again and again.<br /><br />So that makes it a good movie.
B00FAJI116|5.0|David Tennant is absolutely stellar in this British mystery/drama.  Broadchurch is compelling, real and truly breathtaking.  Where would we mystery lovers be without the British?  Smart, dark, interesting with twists and turns.  Broadchurch is a real standout in the great pantheon that is British TV.  \\"Please, sirs, I want some more!\\"
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I am so sorry that I am just getting into this show. I love it. But, I am also glad that I get to watch episodes back to back.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Great if your Ultrabook lacks an ethernet port.  I own a Lenovo Yoga 13, and recently needed an ethernet connection to configure network settings on a printer, so I bought this.  It is not cheap and/or flimsy.  It's plug-n-play, I think I had to download a driver, but that was it.  Windows 8 did that automatically.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It's a really good app I play on it everyday!!! Get this app you will love it. I'm telling you this
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this app. This app is fun and makes you think. The only complaint I have is that I wish there was more to it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|At times as I was reading, I wondered why this unusual story was so popular.  Then I reached the AHA moment at the end.  Now I think I should reread it for the subtleties along the way.  Truly a unique perspective on the oldest story!
1490313370|4.0|Hey, so I liked this book for the most part. If you're looking for this book to tell you exactly what to do, don't bother because NO book is going to tell you that. If you're looking for keen insights, confidence and inspiration to have to get yourself going then this is a good read.<br /><br />If you want to know more, I've written a short blog post here. Would love if you checked it out! [...]
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this is a novel for youth, I found the messages quite adult.  It will make you think about your own perspective on life. . .and death.
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|I bought this movie to go with my mom's Sony BDP-S3100 Blu-Ray Player because this is one of her top favorite movies of all time and I wanted her to see what they looked like on HD verses the standard DVD.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Always loved this collection.  Its completely different then anything else. Rocking Blues and soulful at the sametime. And no one can touch RTs guitarwork or Bill Dewars<br /> vocals
B0089BSM70|5.0|I love Halloween and when they came out with the Blu-Ray of Halloween II and included the TV Version I was very happy.  Everytime this version came on TV I was always working for I was out of DVD discs.  The TV version is not in Blu-Ray but standard DVD but still looks better than when you watch it on TV.  I hope they come out with the Halloween 6 Producer's cut I bought on Ebay years ago that version was 10x better than the Halloween 6 they came out with on DVD.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Enjoyable show.<br />Excellent costuming.<br />In the genre of Downton Abbey.<br />Also enjoyed season 2.<br />Would enjoy a season 3 or more.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I bought this movie because I'm a huge Star Trek fan but I miss the originals, the guy who plays Khan is a good actor but if your a fan of the original Khan he is nothing by comparison.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Funny movie love it, its great always laugh every time. Love the cast always a great team no matter what.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|This was a clean cute movie about a girl who wanted a relationship with her father.  My wife and I found ourselves laughing quite a bit through out the entire movie.

B003UBTX72|5.0|I am really pleased that I bought both the Kindle and the Audible versions of this book! If you're looking for a trip back in time and Keith Richards this will give you both, and more!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Can't wait for season 4! This was TWD at its finest. I love the cast and the characters! Who could ask for anything more?
B005LAII80|4.0|This was way better than Judge Dredd. This kept more with how the comic book was. I thought the action scenes were awesome, and the Rookie is hot.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|Not bad. Its an Ok movie. Some good scenes by very predictable. Watch it and see for yourself. Ending was weak.
B007XAYKX8|4.0|This was an awesome video, excellent filmatography . If you are a rider of any kind of motorcycle and are a racing fan you will definitely enjoy this film
0767919408|5.0|I've been reading Bryson for years, but wasn't enthralled with At Home. I think what may have been missing the narrative thread that binds the historical anecdotes that comprise the bulk of his work.<br /><br />With One Summer, we have that narrative thread through the course of events during one remarkable stretch of months in 1927. This lets Bryson tie together several stories that would each have been remarkable on their own.<br /><br />As with the best of Bryson, what really makes this book sing is the historical detail and context that he provides. You aren't simply thrown into 1927 - for each story, Bryson gives you the background to understand WHY the story he is about to tell is remarkable.<br /><br />And this is done with the wit and humor of all his works. A great and engrossing read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a very good story about  the path people's lives take without even knowing it. It was interesting to see how many lives were effected by \\"The Husband's Secret\\"  the author does an excellent job in describing one  mother's grief.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This series is very addictive.  I read ALL of the &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; books by RR Martin and was curious to see how they would be done as a movie series.  Obviously, there are many differences but none that I can't be OK with.  Afterall, there are five HUGE books in the series (so far) and there is no way HBO could include all the details.  We'd be watching for the next 20 years!  My only prayer is that Mr. Martin will live long enough to finish the last 2 books in the series!  There are things I want answers to.

B005RAO0GS|5.0|When I first heard FATM back in 2009, I didn't really believe that a voice could sound that amazing without digital assistance or significant support from backup vocals. I turned to YouTube for their live performances and the skepticism was quickly dispelled. I was lucky enough to see them live in Denver in 2012 and the show quickly confirmed what I had known for several years, Florence Welch is the greatest vocalist I have ever heard. I'm not trying to diminish other vocalists. I have enormous appreciation for several generations of them, including one of Flo's influences, Stevie Nicks. I'm just letting the reader know that Florence Welch is almost surreal and her live performance is worth seeing at just about any cost. Her popularity has exploded worldwide and there is no need for any confirmation from a fan to buy this album. I just wanted to gush and let you know that I had access to all of FATM's music online, but I bought this album as a symbolic and financial gesture to their greatness. I <3 Flo.<br /><br />On a slight critical note, as amazing and popular as this album is, I still listen to Lungs more often.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game was awesomely epic it was based on the first movie and second movie and sometimes it lags but its fun hilarious and enjoyable also I like how u collect banannas its funny
0062255657|4.0|Really good, but.... I was hoping for more. Both in story and pages. I loved Graveyard Book even though it had a similarly childhood subject matter. This kind of felt like an American God novella for kids. But, still very good.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|You just can not beat this device. I have the Apple TV, and this is every bit as useful, but a fraction of the cost. Works great from the Apple and Android products. Surprisingly, though, not so well from the Chromebook. Go figure. Great idea for streaming Netflix and youtube to the TV.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is a must see for anyone who has ever read the comic.  It is a very dark movie.  Don't expect any comic relief in this one.  The effects are better amazing given the budget. The cast is strong. The plot is not very complex. Most action movies are pretty predictable.  But the ride is well worth it.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good plot, good characters, ending is a little abrupt though. Would've loved<br />a some flashbacks of some of the characters to really tie in the ending
1932100660|5.0|I was blown away by this book.  Everyone should read it, actually it should be required reading in all colleges.  It is amazing that this information is not &#34;broadcast&#34; to everyone so that we know how to change our eating habits.  I immediately changed mine.

B00DMEQP46|5.0|I sort of held liking this band at arms-length initially, thinking they were kids who seemed a bit smarter then they were and wrote some fairly intellectual pop songs by semi-accident. I now understand them to be modern masters of form and sound. They come off to me a bit like the heirs of sounds forged by the Flaming Lips and WEEN. It's irreverent yet serious, fun but focused, psychedelic and tough.<br /><br />The only people remaining who care if MGMT write more electropop singles are people who were 19 when those songs came out. Why people are still talking about their \\"departure\\" from that style of song writing is beyond me. It must be one of those retro things I don't understand. If you're still stuck on that, it's too bad, try to snap out of it and enjoy something that doesn't conform to your expectations, hey, I think that might be one of the definitions of good art!<br /><br />The 2nd time through this record I got a vibe I rarely have but recognize now as the sensation that the music I'm listening to is timeless, that it will always evoke in me this sensation of falling in love with it and will transfer that feeling to other times and places I'll be listening to it. Maybe I'll be driving thru the desert, maybe Glacier National Park, it doesn't matter where, something will connect, and for brief few moments I will be inside this crazy beautiful music.<br /><br />So glad these guys didn't cave to the ridiculous criticisms of Congratulations. don't get me started on how stupid that was. How dare a band grow and expand? Well folks, just like this, and good god it's a good trip. Enjoy. You're welcome. Thank You. My Pleasure.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|At first, it worked well for my AVI files; however, it's been more miss than hit the last few tries.  I'm not sure why but it crashes and freezes my Kindle, forcing me to force quit and restart the device.  Big drag, that is.  I'm starting to consider just deleting the app permanently.  If things change for the better or worse, I may update my review.<br /><br />UPDATE- 1/27/2014: Since this review, I've reinstalled the product, learned more about the settings, and have had very few problems.  It's not 100% perfect but close enough to it for me to make it my primary video player.

B003IDMUWC|5.0|A Time to Kill is the first novel by acclaimed author John Grisham published in 1989 and instantly became a masterpiece in legal thriller genre. A Time to Kill takes place in Clanton, Mississippi and revolves around Carl Lee Hailey, Black, father of four children, three males and one 10-year-old female child named Tonya Hailey.<br /><br />One dreadful day while returning from the grocery store, Tonya was abducted by two racist white `rednecks' named Billy Ray Cobb and James Louis Willard. They brutally rape and beat Tonya and dump her in a nearby river after a failed attempt to hang her. She is rescued by fishers and survives. Both the rapist are arrested.<br /><br />Both men now indicted in rape and attempt to murder of Tonya but Carl Lee fearing all jury members will be white and acquitting - he kills both the accused using a M-16 machine gun by executing a well thought out plan.<br /><br />Carl Lee is charged with capital murder. Despite efforts to persuade Carl Lee to retain high-powered attorneys, he elects to be represented by his friend, white attorney Jake Brigance. Jake Brigance who once acquitted Car Lee's brother Lester in a capital murder case in Clanton.<br /><br />The book is set in fictional town named Clanton, Missisipi. Clanton is the mixture of both blacks and whites but city has 76% of whites whereas blacks consists only 26% of total cities population. The marrow-deep racism still exists in Clanton and white people getting acquitted in criminal cases compared to blacks are very common in Clanton as majority of jury(or most of the time all jury) member are white.<br /><br />This case of Carl Lee becomes a national sensation and every lawyer in the country wants to take this case for free. The quiet looking Clanton city is now filled with reporters and strangers. And to make things more complicated to defense lawyer Jake Brigance, the long forgotten and believed to be lost hundreds of years ago - Ku Klux Klan comes back to life in Clanton. The marrow-deep racism and presence of Klan members are handled pretty well in this book. The brutal attacks of the Ku Klux Klan on those who directly or indirectly involved in the defense of Car Lee Hailey puts them on par with the rapists.<br /><br />All the characters in this book are well thought and well-developed, specially the Jake's character. You can feel the tension mounting up as the trial date comes near and near. Though trial of Car Lee won't take place until the climax of the book. But the events which happens in Clanton before Car Lee trial either the coming Ku Klux Klan or NAACP lawyers who want to take the case from Jake are handled really well.<br /><br />Dialogues are well crafted and is crackling, specially dialogues between Jake and Roark. How the rape and aftermath of the murders effect the folks of the city both white and black is handled well. The psychological effect of rape on victim and victims family is handled well. It's really heart-braking when doctor tell Tonya's mother that Tonya will not have any child in the future.<br /><br />The way the legal system works in criminal cases and how people try to twist these systems either by purchasing one of the jury member to result in hang jury or by choosing all white jury or by presenting false witness or by using insanity defense to defend the victim very well handled and described in such way that even a novice to law can understand it pretty well.<br /><br />This book is well written and at times hard to follow as it has more description than dialogues but once you start reading - it's really hard to put this book down.<br /><br />A sequel named `The Sycamore Row` will be released next month written after 25 years of publication of A Time To Kill. Can't wait to read it.<br /><br />A Time To Kill is highly recommended for anyone who want's to read a good thriller.w-deep racism and presence of Klan members are handled pretty well in this book.

B004TI5N38|5.0|I think this was one of Baldacci's best yet.  I had a hard time putting it down--just wanted to keep on reading!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|perfect casting and portrail of my favorite comic .nathalie portman is perfect and so pretty in this movie. the gods are so over the top perfect
B009JZSC9S|5.0|One of the best shows ever! It's well-written, medium paced and deals with real personal issues. The season ended perfectly for a new chapter in Alicia's life.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|The original was pretty cool, an this upgrade makes it even cooler. The speed increase is fantastic. However, this is still a lot of money for a toy, and I would think hard about buying one before you do.<br />Happy Rolling!
0812986180|5.0|Still waiting to get my hands on it when partner is done readin. Waiting anxiously. Looking forward to it. OK
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show with an amazing cast. This show demonstrates that lawyers aren't always the evil people oppressing the weak but are everyday people living their lives with their own set of complications.
1416583432|4.0|If you know nothing about dogs this is where to start learning.  Many people have no idea how dogs react to everything around them including people, so this is an excellent guide as to how your cute little bundle of fur is going to react and why.  Read it!  It will help with training as well.
B00F91G5BS|2.0|I thought that I was renting this movie in HD, but perhaps since this was the uncut version it was not. Whatever the reason I was very disappointed with the picture quality of this movie.
B000GRUMPU|3.0|If you have big big screen television with all the most up to date features, I think you will get a kick out of this version of Big Box Office Smash of the Past. If you have a simple, nothing up-to-date, television, but have not seen previous versions, you should enjoy it..although not as much since most of the advanced technology screenwork will not be working for you. If you have the latter set-up and have seen all the previous versions, a  more than  little bit of 'I've seen all this before with characters I could identify with' will probably be your response.<br />Other reviewers have pointed out some of what is missing (aside from an hour of movie): lack of character development, absence of any particularly interesting characters, the absence of anyone with charismatic qualities and the decreasing suspense as one after another impossible barrier is surmounted with little pause between them. I would not knock any of the actors for their performances; they did the best that could be done with the parts as written. Dreyfuss, who can capture audiences, is not given the chance, Russell, less of an actor but more of a personality, is also subdued; the rest I do not know and cannot judge in comparison with their other work.<br />To summarize, this is a good version of an original hit, speeded up and cut down in size, to make it move faster, in the process of which much of the interest in the survival of the characters is diminished. For the general audience, not hardened  by viewings and re-viewings of previous versions,  the picture is worth seeing.  For the other categories, it is hard to predict. Some has been added, much subtracted from the original.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Excellent wonderful book<br />It is everything fantasy should be and more a treat for all ages. Highly recommend. Loved it.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Similar the Lord of the Rings songs, I love the songs for this movie as well. Sharp and clear. More than that, the cover is unlike the normal CD. It far exceed my expectation.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Found it very hard to put this book down.  What a wonderful story.  I love books about the South.  Have recommend it to all my friends!
B0000TAZBK|5.0|I never intended to buy this CD until I bought the extended versions of the all the three movies in one set (Blu-ray version) as part of my collection. Really amazing. Love the movies, love the music. What more can I say.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Very few adapter chargers have this current capacity and none has better fit and finish quality ( and they cost more).
B009477BOI|5.0|One of my favorite movies when I was a kid. And now my kids love it too. A real timeless classic. We have already watched it three times in the last week. It's a long movie about 2.5 hours so keeps the kids busy for a good amount of time.
B000002P86|5.0|I was in a record shop with 4 other guys and this cd was playing over the store speakers. Every one of us went up to the counter, asked what cd was on, and bought it. This cd is in my trucks player right now. I f I lost it I would instantly buy another. Hope you like it too.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved reading this book. This is the first time I've read this author and I loved how she brought all the players together. Can not wait to read the others in this series. A really wonderful read.
B006M4F67A|4.0|It's entertainment for lonely people. Some arrangements are more difficult.<br /><br />I don't have anything else to say about it.<br />That is it, be happy with that.<br /><br />..
B0000669JL|5.0|Price was reasonable, shipped expediently, every song on this cd is EPIC, must have for every Bob Marley fan's collection!
B00F35BV64|5.0|I actually did not get to watch this. I had internet problems that would not allow me to view this video. Not your problem, but I did like the movie.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I guess I was a little late to this one but hey it was on Prime for free (technically). So I decided to give it ago, and the following two weeks I watched the movie at least 20-30 times. Lets dive into my review for 2013.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Action: Sequences are still some of the best I have seen. Reminds me slightly of Kung Fu movies but Gun Kata brings a twist. The way it is descibed makes you belive it is almost possible.<br /><br />Direction: Loved it, provided great flow, close-ups of the emotion displayed AWESOME! Found it hard to believe this guy also directed and wrote Ultraviolet<br /><br />Acting: Christian Bale do I need to say more. I am not a fan of Taye Diggs and for the plot of the movie he smiled too much for me. *****SPOILER ALERT****** (You will find this out in the first 2 minutes of the film but if you want to remain completely surpised skip down to the next paragraph) For a nation that is supposed to be without emotion he sure displays alot of it. Anger, confidence, pleasure. Christian Bale meanwhile is cold as ice. Maybe there was an underlying tone that he was not following suit as the rest of the nation.<br /><br />SAFE TO READ<br />Location: Watched this whole movie and wondered where they filmed it. Wonderful location shots definitely gave the feeling of a country torn apart by War.<br /><br />For a miniscule $20million this movie surprised me. In 2004 that was still cheap for a movie. It could have made more but Sony did not want to risk losing profit. I am sure it has made up for it in DVD sales (wish they would release an updated special edition not that blu-ray I keep hearing complaints about)<br /><br />Story:<br />Plot: Many would say it copied from 1984, Farenheit 911 and any other movie containing elements of government control. Unless I am mistaken taking an idea and expanding it is not copying but evolving it especially over 60+ years later for the current generation.<br /><br />Character Developement: Christian Bale-Main Protagonist character developement was awesome, I saw his history, evolve, and what his future self could become.<br /><br />The main Antagonist was great as well with the twist at the end (although I knew it was coming).<br /><br />Taye Diggs once again, I felt was lacking. As I watched the movie for the 15th time I couldnt help but wonder if he was a character rewritten into the screenplay at the last minute. I just never connected with his character the way I did with the others.<br /><br />Supporting Cast: Wonderful, the foils were foils if you will. Fillers were fillers with enough development for you to connect but not confuse you on who/what the story was about.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5 (5 Stars on Amazon because I round up lol)<br /><br />The .5 deduction is for Taye  Diggs/Character/Development. I just felt like he was there to confuse you or add that edge of your seat thrill moment. I just never connected with him the way I did with Bale. Most movies I like to connect with both the Protagonists and Antagonists. His character just felt misplaced. Maybe if he was more cold, heartless, and less grinful all the time I would have liked him more.<br />Movie is great and I will purchase immediately if they ever come out with a decent Blu-Ray release ( I doubt) or Special Edition.rotagonist character developement was awesome, I saw his history, evolve, and what his future self could become.<br /><br />The main Antagonist was great as well with the twist at the end (although I knew it was coming).<br /><br />Taye Diggs once again, I felt was lacking.

014241493X|3.0|First of all, let me put this out there: the first book I read from Green was \\"Looking For Alaska\\", the second book I read was \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" - both of those books are INCREDIBLE (5-star worthy).<br /><br />Well, I just finished this book and it was absolutely dreadful (3 stars out of 5 is dreadful for Mr. Green). The characters were underdeveloped, and empty. The silly search for Margo is just incredibly tedious, and John Green makes sure the reader ALSO suffers through it as Q did. I honestly think this is poorly written and exceptionally boring throughout. I felt like I had to drag myself through this book, especially when the other two Green books I've read I flew through.<br /><br />I also felt a lot of it was unoriginal for some reason, especially the \\"humor\\" (overused, and not really at all \\"humorous\\").<br /><br />And the characters to me were just as real as Margo was to herself - paper, and that's it. He failed to breathe life into the book's characters.<br /><br />But in a way this is all ironic, because my idea for this book is exactly the kind of concept Green was writing about. I was expecting something great from Green, but in reality, it wasn't the case. The idea of this book definitely wasn't as good as actually reading it - word for word.<br /><br />I do not regret purchasing this book though. The idea of the book and a few good quotes are enough for me to attribute some value to it, but I felt like it could've made more of an impact on me. It didn't.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I read all of Philippa Gregory's books, but I thought that this was one of her best. It's the story of the eldest daughter of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville and it's a great one.  I was immediately hooked and enjoyed every twist and turn.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Awesome next chapter, but I was disappointed that there were ads on the paid version. The graphics and story line are great.
B0045INOCO|5.0|Based on Heart of Darkness - the story and theme are complex and the cinematography from Vittorio Storarrro is magnificent- its a multi layered film similiar to the Oddysey in its layers - Martin Sheens best performance of his career
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game requires logical and creative thinking...keeps me interested.  This is a good game for young and old alike. Besides that, it's free!
B008M721MS|4.0|An excellent product, I've had absolutely no problems with calling my love ones living in european countries. A great buy.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Good insight to help break negative thought cycles. I recamend her other works as well. Get this book and read it over and over.
B000ITF86E|5.0|One of  his many great movies. He was great American. Would have like to see him politics. Supported our troops
B002ZM74Y6|2.0|I usually enjoy De Niro - and he gave a good performance in this movie.  But the story line told of a group of people who have absolutely no class.  Plenty of money, hostility, and aggression, but totally lacking in civility.  The macho excessively ritualized manners were laughable.  If I wanted to be exposed to this I'd move to the Jersey Shores.  Really found it obnoxious.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|It was an amazing book and I am reading the magician as well as the rest of the series by Michael Scott!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It is fun to hurl the little birdies at the pigs but it is far too sedentary and hypnotic. I always regret playing when I could have been doing something else
B00CG5MVD6|5.0|Another great performance by Johnny as Sam.  An interesting introspective on schitzophrenia.  If you are a Depp fan, I highly recommend this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app you can get any version of the bible you want and as many. It contains red lettering which a lot of electronic bibles don't have it also has audio and so much more...
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This game is a fun way to kill time but the glitches make it frustrating.  Without the glitches the rating would be much higher.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|It's a good maked action Movie.<br />For Adults only, don't want to show it to the Kid's<br />I enjoyed the Movie.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Wow, Brad Pitt sure is gorgeous!  I think he has some dialogue in the movie, can't remember.  There's some woman and some kids, who cares.  There's some zombies, but I wish they'd get out of the way so I can look at Brad Pitt.  Brad can make even zombies' teeth chatter.  Great movie for Brad Pitt fans.  'Nuff said.
1469259192|5.0|It is another great story by Lee Child with plenty of excitment and action . Several hours of listening pleasure .
B0063IH60K|5.0|It was an ease to download with fun energy! I enjoy the game; a fun stress reliever especially after full day. I would recommend it!  Go for it and enjoy!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is easy to learn and so fun to use. Me and my niece play it all the time and it doesn't need daily check-ins. I highly recommend it to everyone and anyone looking for an easy low maintenance game. It might have a long wait time when breeding or doing things but it's amazing otherwise.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|Cruise is out of his depth in his second attempt to play a tough guy as good with his fists and gun as he is with his quips to his lady &#34;love&#34; interest. The script makes it worse with it's phoney dialog and preposterous plot turns. They say that the Reacher character as written was much taller and heavier, but without knowing this (or feeling let down, as fans of Interview with a Vampire felt when Cruise got the Lestat role),in scene after scene Cruise looks--and acts--positively diminutive. Many times Cruise says something &#34;tough&#34; and &#34;snappy&#34; then looks off to the left in a comically inept attempt to seem tough, while instead looking fey.<br /><br />Cruise might want to screen Fasts & Furious (4, 5, & 6) or any recent Jason Statham film to see how tough and snappy is done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its so fun my sister loves it I mean its that it should go all over the enternet like really
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I had already heard the soundtrack to this film, so was curious to see it. I give it the highest rating because the story is told very well, it is of great historical interest (for fans of music), has excellent interviews, excellent in-studio performances, and is splendid from beginning to last frame (and you should watch all the way to the end). The only weak segment, really, was the Paul McCartney segment. No doubting the ex-Beatle's musical chops, but he's unfortunately allowed to noodle his way to a sloppy impromptu tune that actually detracts from the film. See it!
B002KGEORM|5.0|Love love love this show!!!!!!! amazing!!!!!!!!! I am always just waiting till the next show or the next season. Will be super sad when it's over
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Thanks to Pam!!<br />Much helpful in keeping yourself at the best frequency.<br />A must read for anyone who wants a better understanding of the law of attraction.
B000FA675C|2.0|Previsible<br />Intriguing i didnt like it it was full of common places and situations in all the situations. Good personages
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Iron  Man 3 was the best<br /><br />Iron Man 3 was the best of the 3 Iron Man movies. I can watch it over and over again ,and that is saying a lot for a 65 yr old grandmother of 2.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|You will always want just one more turn, lots of fun! .Neat graphics, sound effects, and great physics, what more could you want?
B00EB6F1TY|1.0|I DO NOT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I CANNOT WATCH THIS IN HD ON MY COMPUTER. WHY?<br /><br />Pretty much most other streaming services allow this if you have the bandwidth, and I have both an excellent internet connection and a computer with a High Definition display and a powerful processor/gpu. I have no issues with HD or playback elsewhere. Not to mention, the information that there is no computer HD playback supported is kind of buried deep in the details.<br /><br />So ultimately, my low rating has nothing to do with the film itself, and EVERYTHING to do with the service. Unfortunately, I am EXTREMELY likely to go find a better service which supports the features which I am interested in.
0061251321|5.0|This is an easy book to read and I think the material has great value.  It is split between being/coming a tribal leader, understanding your current organizational stage and communication techniques (triads) - all useful stuff (if very different topics).  I would have liked more guidance on moving your organization from one stage to another.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|AWESOME GAME! Though there is one bugaboo in my opinion. Maybe the player could solve harder puzzles or trade coins for crystals instead of having to spend money. I know there has to be a profit made, but doesn't customer loyalty and satisfaction lead to said profit? Great game overall. I really enjoy playing.
B002KKCVR8|5.0|This is my second pair.  The first I bought 3 years ago, they are still good but I've used them for outside work so wanted a cleaner pair. I only wish they were not made in China.
B00F2362IE|4.0|its slow downloding but its a really good game thats because I love the turtles and the toys because i have a lot
B007885IJU|5.0|really enjoy their music, and this is a great album, also enjoy that it was released in vinyl, all around good buy
B00B4804KS|5.0|Excellent! Much more convincing in 3D! Really enjoyed the movie. A must have for your 3D collection. One of the best Spielberg movies of all time!
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|It's hard for me to say if this is THE best, they've had some good ones over the years, but this is definitely better than the last one, and it's got some very catchy tunes on it.<br /><br />Overall I give it 5 stars - very happy with this one, whereas the last OMD album was kind of a letdown.
0553801473|5.0|This is a book that I purchased for someone who likes to read.<br />My friend did enjoy reading this book and was happy I purchased<br />this as a gift.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|I'm super impressed with this CD - VERY good - as another reviewer mentioned, it's like they they were frozen in ice since their last album - same great sound, Midge Ure sounds the same, etc...
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|I was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I have to say, the title really is accurate about what you will find when you open the cover. This book is a collection of very short stories, or possibly better to call them anecdotes since each one is only a couple of pages long. Giant squirrels and a misunderstood Minotaur of mythology (he just wants to be your friend)  kept me smiling. And yes, I did laugh a couple of times.<br /><br />The stories are short enough to keep this book in your desk at work when you need to shake off what you're doing for a few minutes and dump your frustrations so you can go back to what you were doing in a better mood. He ties each of the stories together in a way that keeps everything relevant and yet stands well on its own. The stories are light, witty and (were I a doctor) just what the doctor ordered.<br /><br />Now, ordinarily I wouldn't advocate keeping reading material in the car with the deliberate intention of reading, especially for the driver. But in this case, I would be willing to keep a print version of this in my car for those horrid traffic jams cause by construction or the imp of the perverse. Definitely a mood lifter.<br /><br />Normally the books I tend to read are lengthy (500+ pages.) It was refreshing to read something light that not only made me smile, but kept me smiling and reading! I would love to see what else this author has written and plan to keep my eyes out for new books from him.
B0055PMURG|4.0|Perseverance in the face of adversity theme is good for all ages.  The shark bite scene is well done and not too gory, and not the focus of the movie, so even younger kids (8+) should be fine.  Promotes good discussion points.  She seems older in the movie than she was at the time this happened in real life - and that might have been good to show as she seems more mature than a young teenager typically would have been.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I carry this on my New Kindle HD 8.9 and it is great . Ready whenever I need a verse to get me through the day
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Another great season with many moving moments and more than a few cliff hangars. I really enjoy Downton Abbey and cant wait for season 4.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I'm addicted to this show I absolutely love it!! I have not been able to stop watching it since I started the first season! Amazing show!
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|This game is ok.  Was looking for something different and so haven't really played it much.  Also thought my husband might like to play it.  Would recommend the game for a  chance to do something different .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This has got to be the best season yet! So thrilling! The quality of the video was great as well.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|already saw movie a few times, nice to own it<br />nicer still when my boy is old enough to watch it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this, like the first two seasons is addictive! once we start, we want more and cant wait for the next!
B000063UR2|5.0|After seeing what happens when you replace Goldsmiths score in this movie with &#34;tangerian dream&#34; this made me sick so i had to own the dvd that had the original score,,, Thats what the movie is about,,, a beautifull movie set to wonderfull music.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is one of my favorite seasons of Doctor Who to date.  I especially love how the storylines of the episodes are crafted around characters, events and situations that mirror those found in real life.  It really allows the viewer to step back and see and consider the world in a new light.  For example, one of my favorite episodes of this season is the one entitled &#34;Turn Left&#34;, in which Donna Noble has a chance to relive a seemingly innocent choice she made and how making a different choice dramatically alters her world.  It makes one wonder about the choices in ones own world.  Fascinating!
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|have yet to see a bad joseph gordon-levitt movie, this is not a let down, i was impressed with all the actors and writing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!  It was fun and a challenge for once!  Really had to get creative in finding the escapes but I hope there are a lot more levels than the 10 before I had to write a review!  Don't like waiting to continue a game.
0307477401|5.0|If you can listen to this book, do so.  One of Robin Sachs' last narrations - and he is Wallander.  Close to Wallander's own age as well.  The narration pulls the listener into this book as reading will not.  It is, afterall, a sort of meditation on aging, on loss, on death, on understanding your own as well as that portion of the world's history that is yours, and on the sort of young snot who becomes your boss, your \\"superior\\" as you get older in your job.<br /><br />If you are of a certain age and reading this book, you will be tempted too often to put the book down for a bit because Wallender's confrontations with life at sixty will be too much to emotionally take in through your eyes.  Through your ears is a different experience as it feels more like listening to a very good friend's discussion about his health:  hard to hear, but being a good friend, you will listen.  And that is key.<br /><br />It is truly an excellent book to get involved in however you do it; note though, Mankell's goal is not to entertain the reader/listener with a super mystery, an intrepid hero.  The book is offered as a mystery, and mystery it is - but more often on the themes of living, of how we got to be who we are now and the mystery of where we are going.  There is a wonderful line that Wallander has [yes, if I had a copy of the book I could quote it exactly; apologies]; he says that history is \\"not just something behind you, it FOLLOWS you.\\"  Both your own history and the world's.  Marvelous.<br /><br />As for Robin Sachs, a narrator who was excellent at everything he recorded.  Listen to any book he recorded you can.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Mindless fun, just what you need some days.  At first, my wife mocked me for playing all the time.  Now she plays it on another device and we compare our progress.  Thanks GameCircus.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|Bought it for one song &#34;Skinny Love&#34;, but loved it all! Beautiful, pure voice. Can't wait to hear more from this artist.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|You can't watch The Expendables 2 without someone bloody blowing up in front of you or something just absolutely violent in your face happening every 2 minutes.  Lots of action.  Lots of Male Testosterone!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show - characters are well written and very interesting.  Do yourself a favor and get started watching it!
B002PEP4C8|5.0|I'm so glad that I purchased this book.  That young lady was very lucky to have lived through her ordeal, and then to be able to write about it.  Very interesting book.  Kept my interest from beginning to end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the escape game ever, I really enjoys it I could ask for anything better whoever created this game did a magnificent job in creating it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Story line is excelent - acting is suburb - great to be able to view it whenever i want so easily. I use earphones lying in be shile husband watches his special shows
B009GI8J1O|2.0|This is not for the book, just the Enhanced edition.  I love the book.<br /><br />If the Enhanced version is not supported on all platforms, there should be a non-enhanced version available.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Overdone, that's what i think kills this movie. It hair metal, overdone. The cast sings a song, then an actual song, then another cast song.  Thank goodness its a simple plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones, still easy on the eyes, unfortunately in this film has the moves of a baby deer on ice.  And Tom Cruise, well his character seemed fit for his ego, no big stretch there.  Alec Baldwin singing, ears still ringing.  Russel Brant forgetable, and the rest of the cast follows along.  Couldn't watch the whole thing.  Some things are best left unchanged and not duplicatable, and ghat would be the eighties. Ill just keep listening to the albums.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I had a couple of reservations about World War Z - serious ones. I was pleased (and relieved) to find they were unfounded. First and foremost, it's a really good story. Well thought-out, with intelligent characters, and a clever resolution. Secondly, I seriously appreciated the restraint with regards to gore and violence, particularly in the midst of a plotline that was ripe with potential for explicit and bloody scenes. Although the situation in the film is definitely \\"adult\\" and extremely disturbing, the film never takes the cheap shot, and (hallelujah) the world can be saved without a final showdown in a hail of blood and bullets. The acting was excellent, the theme thought-provoking, and the treatment was probably as delicate as possible with such grisly subject matter. Additionally, it achieved an extraordinarily engaging sense of tension. It's dark, to be sure, and definitely not for young children. There are several character deaths that, while implied, rather than displayed on screen, are still heart-breaking.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Was on vacation and needed a calcular to figure so finance options.  It looked simple (the icon), gave it a try and it was as it looked, simple and easy...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I went in skeptically, even though the reviews are so good.  By the end, I was fully engrossed in the characters and story.  It isn't perfect, but it overcomes all its weaknesses.  I read another review that said the characters will stick with you, and I totally agree.  I cant wait to read more in this series.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I found this to be a really good movie, despite the title.  And who know how someone might come up with an idea such as this.  Truly entertaining  and glad to have it in my collection.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I have watched the episodes over and over again, to help me solve this mystery. I love everything about it, the scene, the acting, the script, the music. Watch it, you won't be sorry.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Art is personal preference.  I love this movie.  It is not a perfect movie, but the acting, embedded themes, script, characters, story, just sucked me in.  I did not expect this, but it did.  Highly recommended.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I've picked this movie hoping to sleep on the couch in front of my TV and having some noise on background but ended up watching the whole movie.
1932100660|5.0|The study itself is amazing for breadth and depth. And the proof that we need to improve our health. I've used the info to beat back my cancer.  The last third of the book is very disturbing as Dr. Campbell relates his struggle to overcome Washington lobbies and  get Congress to use his information to improve the lives of the American people.
B00E6890RG|5.0|Just wanted to throw in my $0.02. Just can't get enough of this CD. When it's done I can't wait to hear it again. Excellent work guys and thanks for creating music that moves me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 4, 6, and eight year old grandsons love this game--It is easy to understand and fun to play .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first 2 books were so much fast-paced, that this one had to catch up with me, not the other way around! I think it was a little bit slower paced for the thrill of the first 2, but I guess it has to end sometime! I would have liked if Katniss had some participation in this book, she was left somehow in the background, until she was called to be showed off. Other than that, a great read also. I can´t wait to read more Collins´s books in the future.
0767812166|5.0|An alien arrives and takes the form of a widow's husband.  She is less than interested at first. They take of on a cross-country tip where he is to meet his people for them to pick him up. A study of the human condition by a member of another race, some laughs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i enjoyed this book from cover to back! I felt transported to that place where Collins narrated everything. I know the movie did a great job setting its essence into it, but it´s never like the book! I felt that Catnip felt, it embodied me into her surroundings. Loved it a lot!
B0043JDUNS|3.0|Tony Stark has to go to Congress where Gary Shandling tells Tony he has to give up his super suit because other nations will soon build them. Tony says nope. A guy named Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is an arms dealer and he is somewhat the reason for the request.<br /><br />In Russia a guy (Mickey Rourke) builds a super suit that looks like [[ASIN:B000E7DRFE Marvel Heroes Miniature Poseable Doc Ock Action Figure]] with electricity in the arms (whips). He shows up on Stark at an auto race and cuts up cars before going to jail.  Some witty dialog along the way.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tony is getting sicker by the day and drinks a liquid to prevent the sickness as his heart powersource is killing him. He attend his birthday pary in the super suit and plays the fool.  His friend gets into a super suit and they tear up the house.<br /><br />Tony figures out the problem with the power source and then has to battle the bad guy with the super suit.  Visually pleasing but the plot lumbers.  Like [[ASIN:B000QD3YAO Superman III]] they have to figure out some way to buckle the suit or the guy in the suit.  Everything else is on the side. Some daddy issues and girlfriend issues. S.H.I.E.L.D stuff included.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything was so fast-paced, that it leaves you hooked on, what was happening, why they were doing it, how where they getting of that mess, and you just can't put it down! Pure excitement, pure tension, pure imagination going wild!!
B001KZG99A|4.0|Rich playboy (is there any other kind?) goes along on a military caravan to show off a new weapon.  He gets severely injuried and creates a device that prevents the metal fragments from going into his heart.  Then he builds a super suit and is able to fight his way out of the cave he is in.<br /><br />He returns home and builds a better super suit to fight crime.  One of the members of the board of the company (Jeff Bridges) does not like what Tony is doing.  He gets a super suit and they battle. Girlfriend stuff along the way, Stan Lee appears, he looks like Hugh Hefner.

0307352153|4.0|this book is a very enjoyable read with great insight as to why I (and other introverts) are the way they are.<br />I think it's great that the author also uses data and research to back up her claims.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Absolutely awesome CD with lots of tunes not included in the DVD of the tour. This CD sounds like you are in row 1 at the concert!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Fantastic production with a lot of details pertaining to the Sherlock Holmes character. Benedict Cumberbatch has nailed it in his role as Sherlock.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|If you are a fan of AC/DC this is a must buy! Sound is fantastic, picture looks great, and despite a few of the negative comments regarding camera work, I felt how large a venue this was and what a large stage/catwalk they had. Stadium rock is alive and well, my friends, and its name is AC/DC!!
0307946711|5.0|I am so happy my friend recommended we read this book together as part of an impromptu book club comprised solely of the two of us. It worries me to think that had she not suggested it, I may have never pursued it.<br /><br />As a devoted fan of the film, \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" I expected this novel to be along the same lines but fall short of the 1980s rom-com.  Within the first few pages, I realized that despite the basic premise-- one day in the lives of Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew spanning 20 years-- this novel is epic in scale.  The characters are immediately real and and compelling.  As a 25-year-old aspiring writer who has so far failed to figure out life after college, I found myself nodding throughout Part One (their early to mid 20s), and was often blown away by David Nicholls' insights.  Certain observations he makes about how people think and interact were fresh yet universal-- the type of odd quirks that we all do, but never really reflect upon.<br /><br />Although some reviewers said they couldn't fully enjoy this book because they found Dexter obnoxious and irredeemable, I must disagree.  Despite his many flaws and penchant for self-indulgence, Dexter is adeptly humanized by Nicholls; while I was annoyed by Dexter at times, I could still empathize with the character.  Emma was so wonderful and fully fleshed that my friends and I were left to wonder how a male author could possibly write such a genuine character.  Like most women who have read \\"One Day,\\" I could relate to many of Emma's sentiments and situations.  Her enduring kindness and unshakable determination gave me hope that despite setbacks and false starts, you can still \\"change the world, or at least your bit of it.\\"<br /><br />If my review leaves you thinking that \\"One Day\\" is a sappy chick-lit novel, I urge you to read others.  This is a marvelous work of literature with sharp prose, captivating characters and a timeless plot wrapped in a fresh structure.  No review can do it full justice, so do yourself a favor: Read this book!  Don't watch the movie or its trailers until you have finished it!
B002APU580|5.0|Love this movie and this version is wonderful.  As much as I like Colin Firth this film and these actors are fabulous
0385341008|3.0|A novel written as a series of letters-- brilliant!  Set in 1946, the story follows a London writer's correspondence with residents on the island of Guernsey.  At first the sheer number of letter-senders and recipients is confusing, but it soon becomes apparent who the main characters are.  This book has all the warmth and sweetness of an English tea party: overall, a cozy little novel.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I love Frederick Forsyth's novels going all the way back to the perfection of The Day of The Jackal. Unlike a lot of &#34;name&#34; authors, each subsequent work has been more enthralling than the one before. The Kill List continues his foray into the contemporary issues of terrorism and if you like Forsyth, you'll love this book
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Totally fun for young and old. Something fun to do with  the Grandkids and laugh and giggle and have some fun. Hope the update it occasionally and add some more faces!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|We've used this for our 3rd and it's the best, wish I had it for the 1st two. Great sounds,easy to use, I even use it for me sometimes
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Another heart breaking and gut wrenching tale of two women who helped each other endure the situation in Afghanistan. Incredibly written. I couldn't put it down.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great documentary! This was well done, with great interviews, back story, and the music is amazing. Definitely worth a view.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I am a network engineer. My laptop (like many others) does not have a hardware serial port. This device turns your USB port into a serial port which works flawlessly to connect to Cisco routers, switches, and firewalls. On Windows 8 and 8.1, the drivers for this device will only work if you have a specific chipset. This was driving me nuts until I found out what it was. My boss had some cheap adapters that never worked right. They were simply the wrong chipset. Do not buy these cheap &#34;Made in China&#34; adapters unless you enjoy throwing your money away. This device works as intended. I have already used it on several occasions with success each and every time!<br />UPDATE March 2017. Adapter still works perfectly as always. I actually left it with a customer Sunday after setting up some new Cisco Switches since they had mentioned needing one. I came here without hesitation and ordered myself another!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I have no idea how well this book reflects actual people with cancer, or even actual teenagers, but I found it well written and compelling, successfully making me happy, sad, and angry at all the right times, so I'd call it a worthwhile read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you don't have the latest smart television but it has a spare HDMI port, get yourself one of these and you will be watching Youtube videos in seconds. These would make great holiday gifts! Most people I know, don't have the latest TV, but they have a either a smart phone or a tablet that can cast to this through their home network. Extremely simply to setup!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I've loved this anime feature since it came out following the Discovery album. Beautiful and brilliant. Every album should be so well executed and delivered.

B000SEIDR0|5.0|I've bought several copies to share.<br /><br />fourteen more words required.  ten more words required. I DISLIKE HAVING TO MEET A MINIMUM!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|We've been trekkies for years, and current movie doesn't disapoint, though I do wish the Star Trek people who make these movies would take a bit more time on character development. This story is a remake of  the Wrath of Khan but of course in the new timeline. Dr Carol Marcus is introduced but her nonessential scene in a bra and panties is definitely very posed and she is made to look like Barbie. The actress, however, is good but not given a chance in fast paced scenes to do much. Spock's character is the best and his romance with Uhura is well done. Zoe Saldana does well as a seasoned actress in handling the ADDH script. Scottie is great too.<br /><br />Still it's Star Trek!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Some bugs that need to be fixed like coins disappearing but overall good game I love it! Very addicting and much better than the first love the extra features.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|The amplifier works fine while it lasts. I didn't use for about a month and now it doesn't work anymore.<br />I contacted the seller and, given that I purchased the refurbished one, the warranty lasts less. They just informed me that and didn't provide any kind of help or guidance or suggestions as to how to solve the problem.<br /><br />Maybe I'm too used to Amazon's \\"above & beyond\\" style, but I consider this bad service.<br /><br />Also, be careful because seems like these items don't last long. Many reviews point to the same. If you buy it, it's worth it to pay more and get it straight from Amazon.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Just one of the best movies I seen in awhile. It has action and it's pretty funny. You can laugh at the racism
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun to me.If I were you I would get this game asap.Also you can play in different citys
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Loved this game. I played it for so long the first week or so that my fingertip got sore! A simple puzzle game that doesn't offer much variation from puzzle to puzzle, it doesn't really need to. The premise is so simple to learn, but as the puzzle map gets larger and larger, I found myself stumped more than once. Really awesome for passing the time, and straining your brain pan!
B005PK56TA|3.0|I thought the story line by itself was good, but to many flashbacks and convoluted characters made this series less than what it should have been. See it anyway.
B005NPLX5I|5.0|Couldn't of been happier with purchasing a vinyl and receiving such a great one in perfect collector's condition. I am very happy with this purchase.

B000FA5STS|4.0|Not exactly a Camel Club book but a great read anyway. Sometimes a little slow but it definitely proves that Mr. Baldacci is not one-dimensional.
014241722X|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson as a gift. After glancing through  the book I think he will really like it and if he does I will probably be back for more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best in the world. I recommend this game for 12 and up. It lags at times, but very rarely does this happen. This is the perfect game for horse lovers like you and me.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app beacause it's easy to make collages or how ever you even spell it. I am very creative so I know when art is art. Remember me Brittany the artist

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs is an amazing book, I'll never be the same after reading this biografy. It has encouraged me to be more determined in what I do, take care of every detail of my work, and believe that I can be the cause and not the effect  In the world.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was a really good magic movie,  a lot of really cool illusions. It was a little confusing at first but in the end it was like &#34;ooo I get it moment&#34;. I really like magic so this was a good movie choice for anyone into magic or just like illusions in general.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|All my favorite actors and actresses in this film. I am curious to why it is not more known. I personally loved the book and admired the movie.
140006922X|5.0|I needed a book like this to express my feelings on God ,Jesus and religion .( excellant,interesting ,logical and true.) Great book!!!!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|This is a very enjoyable thriller, one that teaches us a bit about history while keeping us on the edges of our seats.  The acting is good, the script is well written, and the plot moves along well for a story with precious little action in it.  It's not one I'll watch over and over, but it's definitely worth seeing.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|We started season one pilot one night on recommendation by my son.  We were hooked after the pilot and watched all for seasons over the next several weeks, 6-8 episodes per night. Nobody fell asleep ever, this series is that good. Interesting plots, fast paced action, challenges your ability to figure things out.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I thought my kids would like this game and they did. It's funny though because I am thirty years old and I play this way more than my kids do. I just love to play it. I loved the movie as well.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I originally tried this app on my mobile and it's great.  Then I discovered the beauty of the Duolingo website and fell in love.  Now, with the Amazon app I can use the app version or the web version of Duolingo.  I can honestly say that if I had this program to learn French in high school I would have had a much easier time.  I can't recommend this program highly enough to anyone that wants to learn a foreign language.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Super entertaining. Very much a page-turner and a \\"can't put it down\\" read. Seems a lot of folks gave bad ratings for hating the ending. I thought the ending was appropriate. But then... I'd heard so many people say before I read the book \\"Oh that was a good book; I hated the ending\\" that I had already guessed what the ending would be long before I got there.<br /><br />I thought there were a few plot points that could have been explained a little better to make them a little more believable (don't want to go into too much detail and be spoiler-y). Just some spots were the bounds of believability of the lengths the character would go to were a bit stretched for me.<br /><br />This is not normally a genre I read, but I had to see what all the buzz was about. A good read and on the whole I would definitely recommend this book.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Okay, it's not hi-tech but as the newer macintoshes lack some of the standard ports, and having mini-ports, this accessory has the ability to make connection using Ethernet possible. Sweet and short, it works.
B005FDW7AI|4.0|Altogether, this is a very good movie.  It's formulaic theme and exaggerated characters made the whole story too obvious.  If that weren't the case, it would have been possible to be completely absorbed in it.  Costumes and sets were superb and in keeping with the fairy tale quality, production value high.  Any age group could enjoy it.
1476733953|5.0|Until I picked up Wool, I had forgotten how much dystopian narratives really warm my heart.  I loved this book.  I am working my way through its sequel and am very much looking forward to the third installment in the series, and let's face it, everything else Howey has ever written.<br /><br />Wool chronicles a tale of a population of people living in a silo buried deep (150 stories in total) beneath the ground a ways off into the future.  They live in this space because the air outside is no longer breathable, and, in fact, completely toxic.  To keep order, the powers that be periodically send criminals to cleaning (literally going outside to clean the lens of a camera whose video feed is their only connection to the outside world.)  Cleaning is a death sentence.  Secrets ensnarl the silo, fear keeps the people under control, but that can't last forever.  When a woman from the `down deep' is recruited to be the new sheriff, the change in guard takes the entire silo on a journey fraught with discovery and turmoil.<br /><br />The strong female character thrust into a role far above her pay grade, and yet, one that only she could fill; the environment of the silo acting as a character of its own, the only place any of our characters has ever known, yet all secretly want to escape; the, in my opinion, series of unpredictable yet totally necessary plot twists all add up to create one fantastic story.  Howey's ability to set the scene and then fill it with likeable, real people and heart-pumping action suggests, to me, that he isn't going anywhere.  I have no complaints and nothing but accolades for this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am amazed at how the kids love this game.  They share ideas on building what ever they want to build. The sharing is ideas that are implemented on each persons tablet joined on a network.  There is a lot of discussion and excitement.
B001NIA27E|5.0|The best movie about volcano.really amazing and keeps you wondering about what's going to happen.100% much better than Volcano movie.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Davis has some interesting ideas, and pretty much sold me (and my &#34;wheat belly&#34;) to remove wheat from my diet for a while.  I don't suffer from any major wheat allergies, I believe, but am in possession of a belly out proportion with the rest of my body.  It has been a family characteristic, with my father and brother carrying the same feature.  As I have aged and become unable to be as active as I once was, it has become more pronounced and my vanity begs me to do something.  Nutrisystem took the weight off a couple of years ago, but back it came.  My chief quarrel with Dr. Davis is the way he sold out to the Rodale crowd with the implication that the only food worth eating is raw, locally-grown, sea-salted, high-priced, difficult to find, organically grown vegetables.  The man convinced me to give up most of my diet, then proceeds to tell me why I can't eat anything else!  Other than that, the book is okay and I am trying to eat wheatless to see if it really works.
B007PN5CQ2|5.0|I usually don't like live or Unplugged versions of songs, but these are awesome!  Listen to it all the time.  Makes me feel like I'm there in the audience.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This was a super fun book to read. Rose Gardner has visions, usually just silly ones of other people like where they put their keys, until one day she has one of herself, dead! That's the day everything in her life changes. I loved watching her turn from a meek, naive woman into a strong, courageous, self assured woman. When she thinks she is going to die, she makes a list of 28 things she wants to do in the days she has left. She is helped by the very handsome new next door neighbor, Joe, to accomplish the things on the list. I enjoyed this book so much from the first page until the last and highly recommend it.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Starting watching this one rainy afternoon when nothing else was on tv.  Amazon had a deal on season 1.  I was totally hooked by the third episode and have since watched all through the current season 4.  Nochie is a guy you love to hate ....
B00B7NPRY8|4.0|Great book. Just read it for the first time.<br /><br />Hypnotists are the most powerful people in the universe. Kind of strange, but also good. I think it may get better in the following books.

1416562605|3.0|This was recommended to me as a great book. Didn't get it. A maudlin tale of modern India, not much staying power.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love the challenge and the concepts behind the game. I can't wait for the upgrade so that I can continue enjoying the app. It is a great way to pass the time away.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While the book was well written and characters vividly portrayed, the whole thing was just disturbing.  I tend to like lighter books and/or ones without such a disturbing theme so this one was not for me.
B004GJIL34|5.0|Hunger is not an easy film to watch...more one that you endure like a badge of honor.  The scene between Michael Fassbender (as Bobby Sands) and Rory Mullen (as the Priest) is one of my all time favorite movie scenes.  If you watch the film only for that scene (which runs about 20 minutes), it's well worth your time.  The quality of the performances are top shelf, and the realistic portrayal of the hunger strikes is both enlightening and disturbing.  It's a great work by Steve McQueen...just leave the popcorn and candy for another flick.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Starting with the titles, this series is superb.  Casting and acting couldn't be better.  The settings, inside and out, are reasonably authentic.  Each episode follows two soldiers and their families in contrast with several aristocratic families ,including, of course, the major players of the period -- Caesar, Mark Anthony, Octavio, and Cleopatra with their assorted entourages.  One caveat.  This is definitely X rated.
B007STXHTM|1.0|Second camera leaking under the sink.<br />I am not sure why the camera is not water proof.<br />i have a pic, but dont know how to upload it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Explained in easy to understand terms why the melt down in 2008 happened and why it will happen again.  Be prepared and don't get fooled again.
0307476073|2.0|This book was certainly not what I expected.  I thought there would be more descriptions of the Pacific Crest Trail.  Instead, the author used her writing to work out her personal angst.  I kept wondering what she actually wrote in the various trail registers?  She wants to be a writer, and as a first book, perhaps I should give her more credit for her efforts.  I just did not appreciate reading so many details about her emotional baggage.  The book did challenge me to seek out copies of The Pacific Crest Trail:  Volumes I and II by Jeffrey P.Schaffer, et.al .For that, I am richer.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This is a very good movie. The story is very good and the acting superb. The only reason that I believe others might not have enjoyed this is because the plot and story have to move slowly. If the viewer is expecting a fast moving action movie, they might be disappointed. If you have patience with this movie, it will be very entertaining and enjoyable. The special effects are excellent and are smoothly integrated into the scenes.
1451695195|4.0|I appreciate the author's background as a scientist, and understand how this background made him doubt the possibility of an Afterlife.  It is a miracle (to me) that he survived his journey into the Afterlife, and returned to describe it so vividly.  However, my wish is that the author would have given more acknowledgment to the role of Jesus.
B00E5C3AJM|3.0|I really really love this game but my only problem it glitches a lot. I keep missing the job when it finishes. It delays me for a couple of days. Not good  I want to give 2 1/2 stars but it will not let me so it get 3.<br />:-(
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Reminds you of the Lord of the Rings (which in my opinion will hardly ever be matched) and, obviously, the Game of Thrones.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very addictive. Graphics are clear with kindle. Very easy game.  Hope the game gets more challenging as the levels increase
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is an adventure crafted to suck the reader in: his characters could be your friend (or you!) and the scenery further adds to the immersion. You'll find yourself sitting on the edge of the seat waiting to see what stink and darkness lie beneath the next layer a character peels back. Wonderful book!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you love historical romance and drama then thus show hits the mark!  There's even some witty comedic elements added in ...love it!!!
