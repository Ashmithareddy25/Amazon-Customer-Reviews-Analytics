075640407X|2.0|You've read this story before.  A kid comes from nothing, discovers he is extraordinarily special, survives harrowing hardship in his youth, displays grit and resourcefulness, and becomes a powerful hero.  In the process, he shows all his naysayers that he /is/ as amazing as he thinks he is.    It's wish-fulfillment, pure and simple.  We like to read these stories because we identify with that guy who's so misunderstood but wins out in the end.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that.  The problem with _The Name of the Wind_ is that to identify with this character you'd have to be some kind of really devoted narcissist.    The plotline reminded me quite a lot of Feist's _Magician_ books.  If you're looking for special-kid-goes-from-poverty-to-supreme-magicalness, you could do worse than to read those (or Hobb's _Farseer_ books), and you could do a lot better than to read this.  This book takes the same idea and then proceeds to worship the central character lovingly for about 300 too many pages.  Others have written that Kvothe's character too perfect.  Yep.  He's perfect to the point of being dull. He's predictable, and so is the plot -- all the 'twists' are telegraphed many chapters in advance.    The author's treatment of romance is awkward to the point of being bizarre.  Our hero has some typical fantasy-hero ideas about decorum and chastity where the ladies are concerned, but he carries them to a neurotic extreme.  I'd like to think that Rothfuss is going to take the romance in an interesting direction in the sequels and let the character grow up a little, but nothing in this book makes me think that's going to happen.      The book starts well.  It had me interested for a couple hundred pages.  After that, there are simply no surprises.  I like the world-building that's been done here, and maybe if the whole trilogy were one 500-page book it would be worth the slog.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Simply put, this book combined wit, pain, suspense, history, and romance into one beautiful read. I am a fan of historical fiction and The Guernsey...provided some of the most fun and fascinating read about post WWII life on the British Channel Island of Guernsey [as well as London]. I wasn't even aware Guernsey was occupied by German forces especially for 5 years! Thank you to the authors for creating this beautiful story that won't be forgotten!

B001RPZDY0|3.0|Although the most impeccable singer in this production is Yvonne Naef, there is rarely a bad Azucena.  What really makes one pleasantly surprised is Hvorostovsky - his voice here has incredible squillo for a baritone, and the overall color is amazing.  He could be as great as Bastianini in Conte de Luna role if he could manage his everpresent problem - his loud breezing, which really ruins a lot of the effect of his unique voice.  I have seen Hvorostovsky in the Met live, as Don Giovanni, and in the theater the sound of his air intake is just as disturbing as here; it is only unfortunate that the owner of such a voice has such a technical problem.<br /><br />Yvonne Naef is again excellent; yet Fiorenza Cossotto on Karajan's Trovatore, an older DVD, is even more thrilling.<br /><br />Jose Cura sadly showed once more that he simply cannot sing - he does not have a voice, a divine gift, a talent, for singing; perhaps he could be an excellent musician playing some other kind of music; maybe an instrumentalist. If this man did not have his ravishing looks, he would probably never appeared in any important opera roles. In this particular production, he is too bestial, while the whole enigma of Manrico character is that he is a gentle man, not just a brutal brigand.  Perhaps Cura could learn from Domingo playing this role, although he could never ever reach the level of mastery that Domingo, Pavarotti and just about any other recorded tenor possess. This Cura's Trovatore is a shame vocally.<br /><br />Veronica Villarroel sings pleasantly, while she looks and acts like a manequin; her acting here would be more fitting for Olympia, the mechanical doll from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann.  It is strange to see what a lively vivacious woman she is in the bonus track - somehow there, in real life, she looks younger than when she is in the role.  I also did not like her acting with the final scene with de Luna, when she behaves like a weak spineless beggar; how much more dignified Kabaivanska looks in Karajan's version of the same opera.<br /><br />The production is nonetheless lavish; the scene of Schlager Duel at the beginning of Act III is very well staged. In any case, this performance overall is a fire caused by Hvorostovsky - bravo! - and could be bravissimo if he could fix his breezing issue.<br /><br />Lastly, I wish they'd produce more Trovatores than Traviatas - the former is so much more superior musically to the latter, and even the story is exotic, away from Traviata's bourgeois banality.arajan's version of the same opera.

0446567337|4.0|My Grade: 4/5<br /><br />I loved the movie trailer so much that I decided to read this before seeing it. I loved the movie The Notebook, which was also a book written by Nicholas Sparks but I'd never read anything by him.<br /><br />I did NOT love Dear John. I hated the ending. I will not see this movie now. The rest of the book was an incredibly awesome, heart wrenching, love story superbly written. Again, the ending ruined this book for me.<br /><br />P.S. - I loved John. That is all.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|Make no mistake about it, the so-called 'ultimate director's cut of \\"The Warriors\\"' is an exemplary lesson in how to turn a five star movie into a one star movie.    Director Walter Hill has seen fit to re-edit the film and introduce an overt comic book element by inserting freeze-frames and captions between the scenes which mimic the panels of an old-fashioned, four-colour pulp comic book. The effect of this is to completely destroy the pace and feel of one of the best, stylized, urban thrillers ever to be unleashed on an unsuspecting public. As a technique, it may work in the context of a schlock horror classic like [[ASIN:0790744295 Creepshow (Snap Case)]] (which was an affectionate, tongue-in-cheek pastiche of the old EC horror comics) but here it just sucks like you wouldn't believe.     If like me, you're a fan of the original theatrical cut, avoid this like the plague and be sure to pillory the releasing company into re-releasing a nice digitally remastered cut of that instead - because this version sure as hell isn't the film that you and I love.
0802798225|5.0|Amazing book: 5/5!<br /><br />This book was freaking amazing! A must read. It flowed like a movie. This book would make an awesome teen movie. The characters were awesome, relatable, genuine teens who fall in love and overcome so many obstacles.<br /><br />The writing is what sets this book apart from so many other love stories. I loved the differences between Alex and Brittany. It's kind of a modern Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the follow up companion, Rules of Attraction, that will release April 13!
0385495323|3.0|The book was interesting and appeared well researched but the writing a little amateurish.  My biggest complaint though is that the book was misbound with about 25 pages not appearing at all and 25 pages being repeated twice, once backwards.  Very annoying.

B002WCLG48|4.0|Halo Legends is a film that follows in the footsteps of the Batman: Gotham Knight film that was recently released.  It is a compilation of sub-stories created within an overall film, but with each sub-story or section being created by a different artist.  This can create a great viewing experience, seeing how it allows the viewer to see different artists' rendering of beloved characters such as Batman and Master Chief.  Did Halo Legends pull it off as well as Batman: Gotham Knight did?  Not really.  It had some excellent sections, while others left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Halo Legends is a compilation of seven short stories, created by various artists throughout the anime/cartoon world.  Some of these sections are done beautifully, truly resembling the anime that the original creator is associated with, but with a Halo twist thrown in.<br /><br />-Origins: Origins is a great way to open up the film.  These sections talk about the Forerunners who originally fought off the Flood upon their initial invasion of the galaxy.  The Forerunners had no choice but to create a final resort weapon, known as Halo, that would wipe out the entire galaxy.  Before doing so, the Forerunners had collected data of specimens from the entire galaxy.  These specimen would multiply once the Flood was no longer in existence, allowing the galaxy to once again re-populate itself to its former state.<br /><br />-The Duel: Produced by Mituhisa Ishikawa, best known for his work on the Ghost in the Shell films as well as Immortal Grand Prix, this section feels out of place.  The art style resembles a painting, except that it moves.  Whenever the visuals are stationary, this art style looks amazing, resembling something one may find in a museum.  However, upon each motion that the characters take, it feels \\"awkward\\" almost as if it shouldn't be moving at all.  This may be because the visuals appear fuzzy due to the design of the characters, making it difficult at times to view what is actually occurring.  This section follows the fight between the Arbiter and his fellow covenant, and the brutal slaying of his wife at the hands of an Elite.  This was all in an attempt to betray the Arbiter, all set up by one of the Prophets.<br /><br />-Homecoming: Directed by Koji Sawai, best known for his work on anime titles such as Wolf's Rain and .Hack, this section follows the story of the process of Spartan creation.  The corporation responsible for the creation of Spartans, kidnapped children, cloned them, and put them through intense training, leaving them mentally scarred.  Upon escaping and returning home, one female Spartan finds out the truth about her creation and must find a way to cope with it.  Other Spartans who met their clones committed suicide, but the female protagonist is able to proceed with her missions, until the end of the story where she meets a grim fate in the midst of combat.<br /><br />-Odd One Out: Created by Daisuke Nishio, animator for both Dragonball and Dragonball Z, this section feels exactly like these series as well.  It follows the tale of a Spartan dropped off on a planet left to fight a Covenant opponent on his own.  He gets the assistance from two human teenagers who are capable of flying, and pulling trees out of the ground, ala DBZ.  The Spartan even ditches his traditional heavy artillery guns in favor of hand to hand combat, all the while acting goofy, true to Dragonball fashion.  The enemy even at one point \\"powers up\\" reminiscent of Dragonball Z.  Daisuke truly added to Halo Legends what he is used to doing with anime.<br /><br />-Prototype: Created by Shinji Aramaki, the character designer for series such as Gundam, the Prototype section feels exactly like a Gundam episode.  Utilizing giant Mechs, thrusters, and explosions associated with the Gundam series, Prototype is non-stop action.  It follows the tale of a commander of marine team, named Ghost.  Ghost received his nickname due to his constant lack of emotions.  He has been assigned with the responsibility of destroying the prototype mech suit.  He instead uses the suit to fight off the enemy Covenant long enough for his squad to retreat, before self destructing.  A great section, and my personal favorite of the entire film, possibly due to the fact that I am a huge Gundam fan.<br /><br />-The Babysitter: Eiko Tanaka, creator of animes such as Beyond and Kiki's Deliver Service, was the lead producer on this segment.  It follows a team of Drop Shock Troopers who are assigned to kill a Prophet of the Covenant, from a distance of two miles away.  In order to assist with the assassination assignment, the team is lead by a Spartan.  The Spartan becomes side-tracked from the mission due to the constant screw ups of the Drop Shock Troopers, who constantly rely on the Spartan for saving.  Until the end, when the Spartan is attacked and must leave the assassination shot to one of the most arrogant of the Troopers.  Upon learning the truth about the Spartan, the whole squad quickly feels like they are to blame for its death.<br /><br />-The Package: The Package is a fully 3D rendered segment that is visually stunning.  At times the story switches to a first person view, and it feels as if it is truly a videogame during these sections.  It follows Master Chief as he and his squadron try to rescue a scientist from the grasp of the Covenant.  Truly remarkable animation, and a nice balance of story and action make this a great segment.<br /><br />Overall, the film has its ups and downs.  Sections such as The Package, The Prototype, and The Babysitter are top notch, adding enough action, story, and art style to truly satisfy fans.  However, sections such as The Duel feel too awkward and out of place.  It's interesting to see each segment and see how each artist throws in their own art style that utilize for their own shows for this film.  This gives each segment the personality to match its director/producer and add a layer of familiarity to each story.

B000Q6GUW0|1.0|This is not a nice program.  There is nothing about it to enjoy.  Dexter, the main character, has the eating manners of a dog and is disgusting to watch.  The acting is below the level you see in High School plays and the story lines are even lower quality.  If this program is what America is about, we are in trouble.

B002UNMWAG|2.0|I am a true fan of the first Boondock Saints, having said that I loath Troy Duffy. For all the fan boys who will cry foul because the creator of such an amazing first movie could do no wrong in you eyes, think again. For further clarification go watch \\"Overnight\\" it is a documentary following Troy Duffy and his cronies while producing the first film. It becomes apparent immediately that he purely got lucky with the script and directing in the first movie. This is abundantly clear in the second film as typical cliche direction and piss poor comedy fills the screen. Duffy tried to be \\"creative\\" in some scenes, and it is obvious that he tried to hard. IF and when he makes the third movie he should really goto film school first.
0316010669|5.0|Blink is a great book. This book talks about how we make snap judgments about people and the things that surrounds us. He proposes an idea and supports it with many peer-reviewed research. He does raise questions and provoke the reader to ponder on the issues raised and come up with his or her own conclusion. What amazes me the most about him is that all the ideas in this book is about finding ways to improve our society as a whole. I strongly believe that he is a another version of President Obama that wants to help and improve society as a whole. There is more to this book that will make you step back and think about some of the issues affecting our society today. You must read this book!
1592289444|4.0|I first became aware of this story as a teenager back in the 1960's. While visiting the home of my Great Aunt and Uncle, I noticed a volume of the Reader's Digest Condensed Books. One of the condensed books in the volume happened to be this story.  I borrowed  the volume from them and read it.  Even as a teenager (teens tend to  beleive more of what they read than adults) I was somewhat skeptical  about some of the things written in this book.  Looks as if my doubts were justified.  The book does make a rousing adventure story, though. If you read it with that thought in mind, I think you will enjoy it.
B00288KNL8|3.0|One of the reviewers (I apologize for not remembering the name) said a phrase that describes that movie to perfection : \\"frenetic and boring at the same time\\" Could not agree more. It is simply amazing what happens to a - superficially - great animation with great actors behind the characters in the absence of the magic genius and black humor, like Tim Burton's. What could have been a darkly beautiful and gripping story, turns into boring predictable didactics...
0618918248|5.0|This is an eminently cogent and brave book. Dawkins reasoning and arguments are brilliant, his style eloquent and warm. He gives a solid foundation for the improbability of a Creator Deity, the considerable harms caused by Religion and Theism, and the possibility and desireability of living a fulfilled, meaningful secular life.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|With very good animation -that new Nerve logo Sucks- and a well timed progression within the plot, I give it high marks.    BUT BE WARNED, this is a series of multiple movies. Only two are out now and two(or even more) in Japan to follow and if the company(Funi~) plans like most companies do. Do Not expect another movie till Late 2011.

The case is an intriguing who-done-it, wrapped up in some historical information (Sweden, nazis, etc) and an interesting, entertaining, beguiling view of the high tech world.  Good character development, rarely seen in who-done-its.  I look forward to reading the next book.
B002ZHKZCO|3.0|Because after this one, the director decided to fire his DP and employ a Home Depot paint can shaker to film the next other two films. A commentator also thought the director decided to film the fights in ONE SECOND cuts to create \\"exicitment\\".    Back on topic: This is a decent movie. Not a great one. Just decent. I liked it on the Blu, but the DvD wasn't too bad either.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I am an old school rocker from the 70's who played in several bands. I was in Grand Funk and later Ramones cover band. 80's rock bands perfected sound quality but it felt like great rock was becoming a thing of the past. Country became mainstream. Rap pushed it's way in allowing singing out of key and talking fast to become someones idea of music. Other forms like screaming rock as if your possessed and wanna kill your family did nothing for me. I did like a few modern things that showed talent like Avril or Simple Plan. You had to look past all the clone bands like Daughtry and ignore who they told us was popular to find the good music. The only rock to hang onto was the old guys still creating and touring. Kiss, Aerosmith, REM, Rick Springfield, Motley Crue, Bon Jovi. They are all still writing and playing better than ever. They can't go on forever so who will lead the charge and keep real rock music alive? My Chemical Romance. My Chemical Romance is the most important band of this generation. They hit you with a sonic wall of sound featuring great playing and singing. Harmonies layered with screaming emotional angst and themes to relate to. Black Parade is one of the greatest albums of all time. They hinted at genius on their last album and went all out on this one. Sure any musician can tell overdubs were layered to produce the wall of sound. They went for a perfection most bands would never attempt on stage. Through sheer guts they did this album live on a world wide tour. Screaming their hearts out and playing furiously and powerfully to fill the voids that were overdubbed on the album. I saw the live show. They about killed themselves but they pulled it off. Why do you think they tried to kill it off with the Live album called The Black Parade Is Dead! It was a hard album to do live. Buy this piece of history. Musicians put on your headphones and learn something about the art from these guys.
B000006RHO|4.0|wow!! there are only 2 other reviews written for this album. the other albums have like 100 people wrote reviews. but anyways, this is a typical iron maiden album. killer guitar riffs, pounding drumming, shrill vocals that could shatter glass. in my opinion this is a well rounded piece from the metal gods iron maiden. not their best, but still worth being in any metal collection. also recomend virtual xI (i know, not a real maiden album because no bruce dickinson), and powerslave.
B000001TVD|5.0|Tonight is the very first time I'm getting to check out Funkadelic to *finally* see what all the fuss is about, so I decided to make my first experience the Maggot Brain album thanks to several recommendations (I AM a huge classic rock fan after all).    I know this much- without even hesitating, I KNOW I will dig this band.      I like funky rhythms, extended, soulful guitar solos, and muddy production.  That's why I like the early 70's so much.  I already love Funkadelic!    One thing that kind of bugs me though is the title song.  Please don't criticize me for stating this, but the majority of the guitar playing taking place during this 10-minute jam seriously reminds me of several moments from an album called UFO: Flying.      Now the reason I bring this up is because a google search reveals that the UFO album came out in February of 1971, and Maggot Brain came out in July of '71.    I'm not going to sit here and say the guitarist from Funkadelic ripped off his jams from the UFO album (because whether that's true or not, I honestly don't know).      I just know there's a startling resemblance between the title song and the extended jams featured on the UFO album.  Whether there's a connection between the two bands or not, or whether the band members actually crossed paths at some point (like during a tour) and were inspired by each other, I haven't a clue.  I just know I hear guitar playing that sounds nearly identical on both albums.      Despite that, I LOVE the title song on Maggot Brain.  Some of the most beautiful, soulful, and delightful guitar jamming I've ever heard.  It probably surpasses the majority of the previously mentioned UFO album, in fact.      I *would* like to know which album came out first.  I hope people aren't citing this album as something original though, because a little bit of funk thrown in between some guitar jamming has been done before (even on UFO: Flying- I'm SORRY for bringing it up again, haha, please forgive me!)    The otherjam, called \\"Wars of Armageddon\\" is much funkier and almost straight forward in the guitar jamming, but that's actually a compliment to the song because it seems the band members wanted to make it all about the funkiness, and they certainly succeeded with that.  I could do without the nonsense talking bit in the middle though.    Sometimes this album reminds me of Grand Funk Railroad as well.  Check out that band if you like what you're hearing on Maggot Brain.  This is definitely a very good 5-star album.    I can't quite give in to popular opinion and state this is one of the best albums of the early 70's, but for a little bit of funk and rock combined, these guys are definitely quite talented and deliver with an album that's mostly memorable.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|FANTASTIC item for the price!  It seems to be well made and the necessary battery is so cheap that you could use a new battery for every 2-3 uses just to be careful that you always have power...<br /><br />This item was packaged very well and shipped very quickly from the retailer.<br /><br />I own several of these microphones.
0446560065|4.0|I've always loved the \\"Simon's Cat\\" videos on YouTube, so when I found out that Simon had published a book, buying it was a no-brainer.  I enjoyed the book, although I think a lot of the humor from the videos didn't translate well to print.  I think that the reason for that has to do with the humor from the videos being based much more on \\"real life\\".  Even when the cat does things that aren't possible for a real cat to do (wield a baseball bat, point at his mouth), it's still cat-like, because you know that if a real cat could, he would -- they were anthropomorphic versions of real cat behavior.  Besides which, those sorts of things were a minimum in the videos -- most of the time, the cat was doing things like meowing to get his owner's attention, rubbing up against his owner, crouching to spring at a fly (while making that hunting \\"chittering\\" noise cats make) -- in other words, real cat behavior.<br /><br />I'd say probably 3/4 of the book is non-cat behavior.  Nor is it anthropomorphic versions of real cat behavior -- the cat does everything from befriend a garden gnome to tease a hedgehog by sticking leaves on its spines.<br /><br />Still, even despite that, I'd still give the book four out of five stars.  Even if something was lost in \\"translation\\", it still was an amusing book, and worth a read or two.  The borderless cartoons and lack of captions (or any sort of text) let it flow in a way I found attractive and refreshing.  And even if Simon's cat's shenanigans weren't cat-like, they were at least still funny.
B000NA28I4|5.0|The movie eragon came in excellent condition and I really like it when it comes this way.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I love this version of Persuasion! I think it is beautifully done. I wish it were longer. I love Sally as Anne, she does a great job and she is lovely. I highly recommend the movie to anyone that loves Persuasion the book.  Spoiler Alert!!!!!  As for the last ten minutes where Anne is running around the city looking for Captain Wentworth, I loved it. Maybe that is not what a lady would have done back then but if I had been seperated 8 years from the man I loved with all my heart I would run after him too.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The latest Studio Ghibli masterpiece (would they even be capable of producing a bad movie?) is based on Hans Christian Anderson's \\"The Little Mermaid\\" but reworked into a new, distinctive take.  Under the sea is a once-human wizard, now a magical being, loyal to nature and indignant over man's treatment of the Earth.  He has hundreds of children, strange little fishes with faces, whose mother at first remains unseen (I'm trying not to spoil the surprises of later in the movie).  When one of these fish - an especially adventuresome little girl fish - is washed up on land and rescued by a little boy named Sosuke (who keeps her in a bucket of water and names her Ponyo), the two become inseperable.  Then little Ponyo becomes infused with human blood - after she licks a small cut on Sosuke's finger to heal it, and is changed.  She can become human, and yearns to stay on land with her beloved little friend, Sosuke.       The little pair finds themselves at the center of a global crisis when the world, already out of balance, becomes much more so when the wizard's Water Of Life is accidentally unleashed upon the ocean.  To say too much more about the plot would be to rob the viewer of discovering how this wonder-filled story unfolds on their own.  It has hugely memorable characters, focuses deeply on the bonds between people - between Sosuke and Ponyo; between Ponyo and her parents and her numerous sibling fish; between Sosuke and his mother; between Sosuke, his mother, and the father who has to be away at sea for long periods of time; between Sosuke, his mother, and the old ladies at the senior center she works at; and so on.  It's full of whimsey, comedy, awe, and a pure, magically innocent little love story.  The animation and the use of color is fantastic, and the worlds and events represented in that animation are amazing - the undersea home of the wizard; walls of water being pulled skyward toward the moon; massive ocean waves transforming into huge, titanic-sizedfish and back again.  The beautiful animation is complimented well by great voice acting.      Studio Ghibli (makers of [[ASIN:B000CDGVOO Whisper of the Heart]], [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]], [[ASIN:B002ZTQVLG Kiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVD]], and a host of other gems), just continues to amaze.  Ponyo is one of the year's most perfect movies.

Along the way Columbus shares his \\"Rules\\" of survival with the audience, things like \\"Always Check the Backseat\\" or \\"Always Wear Seatbelts\\".  En route back to Ohio, Columbus hooks up with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), another survivor of the plague with a taste for Twinkies. Together they decide to travel east, and along the way meet a couple more survivors, two sisters known as Wichita and Little Rock.<br /><br />The basic premise has been seen in tons of film, played both straight and for laughs, and while \\"Zombieland\\" boasts a better cast and better special effects than most B-Movies, it never really rises above the rest of the pack. There are a few moments that are downright funny, and one surprise cameo that is the highlight of the film. I recommend at least a rental of \\"Zombieland\\", but not sure how often you would go back for another viewing.
0446567337|1.0|Let me just say I am beyond grateful this book was a short one. Being someone who has dated and married a military man I was expecting something far more meaningful, explaining the true passion of what a REAL couple feels when falling inlove so deeply in such a short amount of time and then having to leave one another. As someone who has experienced that, I was looking to read this novel and somewhat relive my own experience. NOT SO! This story was unbelievably flat and I felt as if although idealy we wish we could all be as perfect as Savanah, I would rather not be as boring as her. I found myself strongly disliking her and found that she lacked any real personality at all. It felt as though this awesome author was more focussed on writing a book about being vertious and religuous then writing a passionate love story to remember for years to come. As for me I find myself wishing I could forget how annoying Savanah was. John was almost induring but also extremely flat and more obsessed than passionate. I'm hoping someone comes along and writes a true to life love story about being inlove with someone in the military. It would also be nice if they could twist it around a little and make the female the one in the military, and her man waiting for her to return. It seems that story has never been told. Either way I am telling all my friends not to waste their time on this one, and honestly I'll be skipping the movie as well.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|I have heard a wide variety of opinions concerning \\"District 9\\", and it seems as though folks either love or hate this film. Not sure why I put off watching it for so long, but I finally popped it in last night.<br /><br />At first I had a lot of reservations about the flick. The \\"hand held shaky\\" cam thing has been done to death with \\"Cloverfield\\", \\"Quarantine\\" & \\"Diary of the Dead\\". But there is a good reason a majority of the film is presented in this format which is laid out right at the beginning of the film. And while there are many scenes shot with the hand held camera, quite a bit of the film is shot in conventional style as well.<br /><br />The basic storyline is that aliens have come to Earth, most likely by accident, but we are never really told for sure. They've been living among us now for almost 3 decades and now must reside in a slum known as district 9. Crime is out of control, human citizens of Johannesburg want the aliens (prawns) taken out of the city. And as the film begins, we meet a low level bureaucrat who has been put in charge of relocating the aliens to a spot 200 miles outside of the city. Neither the aliens or the Nigerian gang who control the black market in district 9 want to relocate...and both are willing to kill to keep it from happening.<br /><br />I see some folks drawing similarities between \\"District 9\\" and a host of other Sci-Fi films, but I still think this is one of the most original films to come out in theaters the past couple years.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing. I normally hate CGI effects in a movie. More often than not they look like cartoons, but the CGI animation in \\"District 9\\" is phenomenal. The \\"prawns\\" look amazing, and for big buggy aliens, they somehow are still able to display a wide variety of emotion. The action is top notch, but this isn't a straight action flick, the action takes a backseat to the storyline and the characters. If you like a little more depth to your sci-fi I highly recommend you pick this up.
0316044938|5.0|Love Love Love this book. I attempted to read this book aloud to my daughter when she was first born, but soon discovered that it was nearly impossible. I found myself in tears most of the novel. This book is a powerful journey of a girl loosing her childhood, being robbed of her adelesence and adulthood. What could and should have been lost forever. I do wish the end could have been more gripping but all in all it is a beautiful piece of literature and it's not easily forgotten.
B0018QCXFK|5.0|My husband, my 2 year old and I have watched this movie a billion times and still love it : ) Since my daughter wants to watch this again and again many of our friends and family have seen it now and I haven't met anyone who didn't like this movie!!
B0000630BT|5.0|Im not too crazy about judas priest but this is one of the best albums they have put out. My favorite song was pain killers and it sounded awesome and the rest were kick @$$ from start to finish. Many great metal bands were pretty much influenced by this bands music with all the metal rifferage and the high noted rob halford wannabe's (AKA king diamond/ mercyful fate).<br /><br />If your new to judas priest then this is one of the best albums to start! \m/ \m/
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I found this book a really delightful read . I liked the story line ..it never got dull and I did not guess til almost the end  what the heck WAS going on.. which happens rarely..I felt it read well, good development and flow.. I don't think you will be dissapointed. My only dissapointment was when I finished it.. AND IT CAME IN KINDLE FORMAT..
B002UNMWAG|5.0|I am a huge fan of boondock saints.   Don't listen to these people. Yeah, it was a bit cheezy and the new FBI agent sucks..BIG TIME. I heard better accent impressions in my high school drama class.   The movie is great though.. I mainly wrote this to help the rating so far. Hell, I even saw a review where a guy gave 1 star, just because he wasn't smart enough to open the packaging right and is afraid to break the DVD..  Definitely worth watching. Deep down I want to give it 4 stars, I just wanted to help the rating.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I can only review this item regarding the shipping and condition it was received, as I have not seeing it yet.  The DVD came on time, as promised, and in excellent condition.
B00005AR3G|4.0|The movie is great of course, but I was a little disappointed in the condition. There was a ring on the cover from a drink that had been placed there and play dough or something on the inside...I understand it is used, but play dough? The movie works great though!
B002EC3932|5.0|If somebody wrote a review that simply said, \\"This is not only the best jazz album of 2009 by miles but also one of the most thrilling, most imaginative trio albums ever committed to record,\\" I'd probably buy the damn thing. So I'm saying it, so buy it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Excelentes cover de clasicos con una estupenda voz y linda orquesta, ojala sigamos recibiendo nuevas grabaciones de esta cantante que tiene una voz privilegiada. Wonderfull
B002H3F7F6|1.0|If I could give less than one star I would. There is not one good track on this whole CD. Not even die hard Sting fans will find this listenable. This is what happens when a artist is rich and doesn't care what his audience thinks of his music anymore. Or he thinks they are so stupid they will buy a album anyway. I have also noticed that as artists age they really do loose their ability to make good music. Their creative juices have dried up. This whole CD is dried up. Really Bad!!!!! Save your money.
0316017922|4.0|No, it [excellence] doesn't start with talent, it starts with love.<br />---Malcolm Gladwell on Jimmy Kimmel Live (1-13-09)<br /><br />Luck is what you have left over after you give 100 percent.<br />--Langston Coleman<br /><br />---<br />The zeitgeist in the world of practice is the 10,000 hour rule, a fact that first appeared in Ericsson's research into excellence. Basically, it means that if you practice a thing for 10,000 hours, you'll become a master at doing it. It's an oft-quoted statistic and is an important factor in all the books I've reviewed in this blog, and it's no surprise that the 10K rule also appears in Malcolm Gladwell's latest book, Outliers: The Story of Success (and the talks about it). But the 10K rule is an oversimplification. More on this at the end of the review.<br /><br />Gladwell has produced similar popular books ([[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]], and [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]]). His writing has received some criticism, most notably a scathing New York Times review, a paper that has published Gladwell's writing since 1996. This and other criticism fail to take into account that Gladwell produced exactly the kind of book he set out to produce: something that is interesting to read and which gives us an intriguing take on a Big Idea. To criticize the work for its lack of scientific rigor or flawless logic is to miss the point entirely.<br /><br />The book, like much of Gladwell's writing, is full of anecdotes and interesting facts about people who have proven their excellence, people from Bill Gates to professional hockey players. Gladwell's focus is not on the individual but on the myriad circumstances surrounding that person's success. It's an approach that has more of the nurture than nature in it. He finds, not surprisingly, that there are many complex factors that go into anybody's success, and some of it is luck, but there is no luck without significant hard work, and the support of many people and circumstances. Again, no surprise.<br /><br />I found the book enjoyable, and worth reading. His take on the ideas is intriguing, and although there is nothing particularly revelatory in the book, I don't believe this was Gladwell's intent. His intent was to write an entertaining book that is more a conversation than a compendium on what excellence is, and in that sense he's succeeded. It's broken into chunks of about 1,500 words, a practice that Gladwell uses because he believes that's a size that most people are willing to sit still for. His sales figures seem to support this approach.<br /><br />What I found myself searching for, and which I didn't find much of, was a more specific look at the 10K hour rule. Gladwell does correctly say that passion must be a part of the equation, or there would be no will to put in the 10K hours. Surprised? Of course not, but at least one detail of the 10K hours is touched upon, but few others.<br /><br />This has been the same critique I've had of all the books on this subject (and much of the research) I've read so far. This isn't a critique of the writers, because they're not focused on the makeup of the 10K hours. But it's what I'm interested in, and probably millions of others who practice music (or anything else for that matter). What is within those 10K hours? How do they play out? If I sit in a room and play an F on my trumpet four hours every day until, after 10 years, I reach the 10K hour mark, I will not be a master trumpet player. There is much more to the 10K rule than just putting in the time.<br /><br />Stay tuned to my blog ([...]) to find out exactly what's inside those 10K hours, at least in the field of music.people and circumstances.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I just recently got into supernatural about one month ago. Like all others, school and work consume all of my time so I never get to watch anything on the boob tube when it comes on. I love to just by a series and watch it from head to toe. Anyways I enjoyed each season of supernatural so far. I just finished season four and I'm ready to purchase season five.
156224003X|4.0|I have to make the disclaimer that reading this book resulted in a sea change that deeply affected my philosophy and approach to teaching, learning, playing, and listening to music. It came along at just the right time to make a big impact on me and because of this, I had to revisit it as I think about The Practice of Practice. In my re-reading of Werner's book I see again a wisdom and a reverence for Music that still shines through. I still recommend the book highly, but on the re-reading I notice some things that may turn off some readers, and I'd like to address these because even if you have a gem in a pile of dirt, you'll still want to sift through the dirt so you can put that gem in your pocket to dazzle people with later.<br /><br />That metaphor is a little strong, though; I wouldn't necessarily call it \\"dirt\\" when KW gets a little preachy. It's kind of touching if taken in the right spirit. Werner has a very spiritual approach to music that at times borders on what a friend of mine calls, \\"hippy, trippy-dippy, New-Agey nonsense.\\" I don't believe that is true about most of the book, but I can see where he's coming from. Don't let that turn you off. Especially useful in this book are Werner's thoughts on how fear can (and usually does at some point) affect one's playing, and even the way one listens to music. Fear of any sort doesn't result in good playing and it may well force you into quitting altogether. This is bad. If you can get a handle on fear early in your pursuit (or at any phase of your journey), you're better off than most.<br /><br />Werner's chapters on fear start around page 51, so if  you can't get into the earlier material, skip ahead to these gems which alone are worth the price of the book. The chapter titles are: 5--Fear, the Mind, and the Ego, 6--Fear-Based Practicing, 7--Fear-Based Teaching, 8--Fear-Based Listening, and 9--Fear-Based Composing. After writing eloquently and persuasively about how fear can hamstring our playing, Werner then offers a solution to help deal with the fear, which may well never go away. He offers up some meditations and ways of thinking that can help you get over those fears, and though some of it may sound New-Agey, I can tell you it's worked well for me, though I've altered his philosophy slightly to fit my own beliefs more closely.<br /><br />The book's focus is on jazz improvisation, but this is just a way to focus the conversation. The wisdom within these 191 pages can be used by any musician of any level. The notion that \\"there are no wrong notes\\" is something anybody and everybody should attempt to adopt in their exploration of sound. Despite the sometimes preachy nature of the book, it is one of my more highly recommended books for those who want to play music. Hope you like it.  Hope it's helpful.<br /><br />Have fun.

B0028K3192|4.0|I have to admit that I'm not much of a Maxwell fan. The only songs that I know of by him prior to this CD is what was played on the radio. Now that I have this CD, I'm really impressed. He has great voice control and more importantly he seems to be singing about something fresh. He's in his own lane. A few of his tracks have too much bass in it for me but for the most part his vocals are consistent. You could probably play this CD all the way through and not skip a song. Definitely a good CD to pop in the car while you're driving... Very solid CD... Impressive to be gone for such a long period of time and come back with a solid body of work...
0425220931|4.0|I'm a long-time fan of Carlos Castaneda's books ([[ASIN:0520256387 The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge]]), and Wooten's The Music Lesson is cut from similar cloth. In the Castaneda books, the author--an anthropologist--studies with a Mexican Yaqui shaman by the name of Don Juan Matus who teaches the author many things: about plants, about spirituality, about his own inner self, and much more. This is done in a humorous and almost entirely believable way. Debate still continues as to whether the books are fact or fiction. Castaneda used them to earn degrees in anthropology from UCLA. Later critiques question how factual the accounts were.<br /><br />While the \\"authenticity\\" of Castaneda's books are still in question (the scare-quotes are because what is authentic does not always have to be factual), \\"The Music Lesson\\" is clearly a vehicle for Wooten's philosophy of what music is and what it takes to have a meaningful, sustaining relationship with it. And don't get me wrong. Wooten isn't trying to pass this book off as fact, evidenced by his words on page vii: \\"WARNING: Everything in this book may be all wrong. But if so, it's all right!\\"<br /><br />The Music Lesson is also a first person narration about a master teacher who appeared Wooten's house one day, oddly dressed, acting even more oddly, challenging the narrator to question his assumptions. Throughout the book this teacher--Michael--and a couple other improbable teachers, push the narrator toward a deeper understanding of Music and Art by way of many situations and adventures. The book is cleverly constructed around 12 \\"bars\\" (chapters), with a prelude up front and a coda at the end. The chapters are named after musical elements touched on in the chapters: groove, articulation, emotion/feel, rhythm/tempo, tone, listening, etc.<br /><br />It's an easy read, and I enjoyed the book. I did find some of the dialogue stiff and not particularly believable. Turn on your suspension of disbelief, for sure. Had this been fiction or an attempt at magical realism, I would've stopped reading, but it was Wooten's intent that kept me turning pages, and I applaud him for that. Especially satisfying for me was the end of the book and the way he brought things full circle.<br /><br />While The Music Lesson won't give you many specifics about what to actually do when you practice, the book does contain a lot of food for thought and a way of relating to music that resonates with my own experience and philosophy. If you haven't read it, go check it out of the library or buy a copy.

B002UNMWAG|4.0|There may never ever be a truer love letter to fans than The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day.  Writer/director Troy Duffy manages to reassemble practically the entire cast of the cult classic first film, and while the results may not hold up to how great the original film is, this sequel is still a wonderful experience.  The film begins with a murder of a Boston priest, which draws the McManus brothers Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) out of seclusion in Ireland, along with their father Il Duce (Billy Connolly), on a revenge mission against the mob, which leads to even bigger developments with just who is pulling the strings.  In between all this is a new partner for the brothers in Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr.) and sultry FBI agent Eunice (Julie Benz), along with some genuine surprises and enough nods to the original film to make even casual fans stand up and smile.  True, this sequel isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a more than worthwhile endeavor regardless, and is wholeheartedly worth your time.
B00328G4V6|3.0|Yes these are unfinished and retouched recordings but I agree with others that the sound quality is excellent. Especially considering the source material. Frankly I like the 2 bonus instrumental tracks the best of all.  It's great to hear Jimi stretch out and jam.  His guitar soars straight to my soul. I also like the instrumentals Sunshine Of Your Love and Lullaby for Summer despite the reused Easy Rider riff. The other tracks have there ups and downs and its great to hear other versions of some of his classics. Any true Jimi fan would want this.

0812973992|5.0|When books consistently change perspective, it can be annoying.  Just as you get involved with some characters, a new chapter starts and you are supposed to start caring about some unfamiliar people and situations.  However, when the author is a master of voice, like in this case with Colum McCann, you don't care.  You go along with anyone he wants to introduce you to, and it takes about a page before you are immersed in the new perspective.      Let the Great World Spin keeps things popping.  You get to meet a myriad of sharply drawn, distinct characters-- from Jazz a hooker \\"on the stroll\\" in the Bronx, to the judge who sentenced Philip Petit, to Corrigan (the most wonderful character of all-- an Irish immigrant attempting to fulfill a spiritual calling in the slums of NYC)-- and observe the overlap and interconnectedness of human experience.  The shifts happen quickly and the story never drags.      It is also a period piece.  You live and breath New York City in the early seventies which is a pretty interesting time and place to visit-- the graffiti writers, the drug use, the Vietnam hangover, the postmodern artists.  The storytelling had that edgy dirtiness that I like, but is also touching and brings you to deeper themes about human frailty and the layered quality of our experiences.  It resonates after you are done reading it like all great books do.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|I own a couple of M.J's early solo recordings, and of course who didn't love The Jackson 5. I was recommended this DVD and got to borrow it from the Library. I enjoyed it as I had never seen MJ in concert. He was a charismatic performer in the league of Mick Jagger and James Brown.I watched the DVD with the subtitles on because even though I knew MJ was a fantastic singer, I could never understand his lyrics. Oh My God they have got to be some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard! Not GENIUS material. He did allot of repeating a certain phrase over and over. \\"Dance in the Round\\"  \\"Annie Annie Annie\\" . I never listened to him after he got way crazy with the plastic surgeries and other exploits. He was such a good looking guy. He really did not want to look like Papa Joe.Rest In Peace Michael, if you are really dead.

B00275EGX8|3.0|If you like the TV show COPS, the you will probably like Hurt Locker. Like the former, however, I found this movie very dull and anticlimactic. There was no character development per se, ergo no plot, ergo boring. There are a few cool scenes, some explosions. I love the scene where he is staring at the row of cereal at the end. That was brilliant. This is just how it feels when you come back after living in a foreign country! Also, a nice cameo by Kate from Lost. Also, what the heck is with that sniper scene where he takes out the guy as he is running. Maybe this is possible in Call of Duty, but I seriously doubt it in real life. Snipers have years of training and this guy just picks up the dead guys Barrett and goes to town? No sir.    The problem with this movie is not so much that it is pretentious, in my opinion, the problem is that none of it really amounts to anything. Nobody really changes, nothing goes anywhere, and it's all just so much cinema verite gas. Not one I will care to see again, though it was worth seeing once.

2839906171|5.0|I already downloaded the free preview PDF a few months ago. When I wanted to order the book it was out of stock. Luckily it became available again and I ordered it right away. The PDF doesn't do justice to the overall design of the book. By using a very clear and unique design it's very easy to read and visually remember the contents of the book.  I'm only halfway trough the book but already find myself thinking in a different way about business models for my company. Up to this point I have only one minor complaint: Although the examples in this book of business models used by Google, Apple, etc. are very clear, I think it will prove useful to have way more of those examples but with small differences of the main business models. Or zoom into the details of business models. I think this will inspire the reader even more. But then again, maybe somebody starts a website where just this is discussed... If you know such a website, I would greatly appreciate it when you share it.

B0015XHQTY|5.0|This one is my second favorite to the first Dirty Harry film. Liked it better than Magnum Force. Very excellent cast in this film and plenty of action in this one as well. Always good to see Clint Eastwood carrying the big 44 Magnum chasing crooks in the streets of San Francisco. Highly recommend this one to Dirty Harry fans or collectors.
0812580346|4.0|Is the future ours to explore or are the events we have yet to experience set in stone? This seems to be the major thrust of the novel, even though for much of the plot it is only the backstory of one determined individual to change his own tragic future. And while it is determined that the future is ours to mold and change, none of the characters go through a similar transformation. They fall flat and shapeless before the science that they are trying to explain to the reader, and the actions they complete never feel true to who they are. Interesting concept, poorly executed delivery, I would have loved to see these people more defined and have gone through the missing years with them, rather than flashing forward from the impact to the time it portrayed. Maybe then I would have cared what happened to them.

B001O1O71C|5.0|In a world where books are flung at us and there is too much sloppy writing, this book is remarkable. It is well written. I was struck again and again by the author's talent.  The author writes in such a way that your mind fills in what Bruno isn't understanding. The story itself is sad and inevitable. As the mom I caught on to different facets that my children would never have understood. As this story is told by a 9-yr old Bruno, he constantly misunderstands what is going on in the turmoil around him. For instance he calls Hitler the \\"Fury\\" and they live in a crumby house at \\"Outwith.\\" As another reviewer said, there is a lot in this book. It is not for young children; I had to take time for discussions with mine or this book would have been out of their comprehension. I read it aloud to my children 8 and 9, and we used it to spur on many conversations. Although they attend public school, I have more of a homeschoolers mentality, and we have been reading and lightly researching WWII. It's lead to more appreciation of their great-grandfather who is still with us. And he likes that my young children ask him questions and listen to his stories.

B001C4AFOY|4.0|Americans have seen \\"The Young Victoria\\", prior to the DVD release, but it certainly had a limited release.  I was lucky enough to see it at the venerable old Tampa Theatre.  Victoria, an only, lonely child of royalty, lives through the death of her father, the Duke of Kent, as an infant, and for the rest of her formative years is subject to the iron-willed control of her mother, the Duchess of Kent, and her lover, Sir John Conroy.  Should her father's brother, King William of England, die before Victoria turns 18, Victoria's mother would wield power (and Conroy with her) as the young queen's regent.  Throughout her childhood and adolescence, Victoria is confined, escorted, watched, and cajoled to divest some of her future power in the couple who keep her isolated.<br /><br />Emily Blunt portrays beautifully the young woman who became the longest reigning ruler of Britain.  The beautifully paralleled story tells of her coming of age and learning the political checks and balances of the life of a young monarch in a kingdom where it is too easy to make political missteps; and her slow and fascinating courtship by Prince Albert, a cousin from her mother's lineage.  Rupert Friend as Albert is just as believable as Blunt; their chemistry is more ethereal than visual; they share a passion to serve people, they renounce the political.<br /><br />The film is inbued by rich settings and costumes, and paced well by its director, Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e.  An excellent film for history buffs, part love story, part an illumination of an era of which surprisingly little is known in America, with excellent supporting players and a beautifully tailored script.  I'm looking forward to the DVD!
B001MW0J2O|5.0|It irritates me so much to read some of the the one-star to two-star reviews for this album.    One review in particular made me so mad, because the reviewer stated that after hearing the cd once, he or she tossed it. When you listen to a cd once, you only focus on the exterior of the songs.     To fully enjoy music, you should clear your mind, push away all distractions, and let the music absorb you. One time listeners of Merriweather Post Pavilion will most likely not enjoy the masterpieces that Animal Collective has presented. I've heard this album over 30 times now and every time I listen to it, I get rewarded by a piece of music I missed out on beforehand. Panda Bear, Avey Tare, and Geologist make music the way they want to make music. It's up to all of us listeners to decide whether we enjoy it or not. You either love it or hate it. All I'm trying to say is it takes more than one run through to really be able to rate this album one star.     The members of Animal Collective have grown to make music exactly the way they want to. Listeners should listen to all of Animal Collective's albums and EPs chronologically and maybe then will they realize how much of a present this album is to them.    From start to finish, this album is incredible in so many ways. It really takes you in. I can honestly say that there is no song I would skip.    5 out of 5. 10 out of 10. Most definitely one of the top 5 albums of 2009.
0802473156|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend, and then bought two copies to pass on, one for a wedding gift, and one for a struggling couple.    This book is for those who have had failed relationships in the past, are struggling in a current relationship, or just looking to get closer to your spouse.  The book is very helpful in recognizing what is important to each spouse and how to give each spouse what they need to feel loved.  There is a quiz at the end that prioritizes the five love languages for each spouse.  It is helpful to recognize which expressions of love will be most valuable to each spouse.  One may prefer actual gifts, expressions of affection, or a simple act like making up the bed.  It is really simple, but an eye opener to understand which forms of affection are most valued.  My husband and I get along in general, and when we took the quiz we realized we are aligned on most of the 5 languages.  Probably the \\"secret\\" to our success.  I think it would be even more valuable for those struggling with love, because the book also contains exercises to try for a week, and then re-evaluate your relationship.  Helpful book for growing closer.  Each love language is fully described in a chapter in the book.  It seems like common sense, but sometimes you just don't understand what the other person needs, and this book will help you \\"get it.\\"
B002ZTQVBQ|2.0|Earlier today I ordered this Blu-ray. I made the mistake of not checking if the Japanese track was in a lossless format. There was no information about this on this site. The scanned picture of the back cover isn't very good so it isn't easy to ascertain if the Japanese track was lossy of lossless. I went to [...] and noticed there that the Japanese track is, in fact, only the lossy Dolby Digital. Since amazon is now shipping my item I cannot cancel the order, but I want to warn other people about this. I am sure that the picture quality is great and being a great Miyazaki fan I am sure that the movie is equally great.  Being a great Miyazaki fan I always listen to the original language track, NEVER the dubbed track. I did try and listen to the dubbed track of Kiki's Delivery Service at one time and it was horrid. Changing the music to fit the English language is truly dreadful. I have also discovered on other dubs of Japanese anime that quite often important plot points are distorted or directly incorrect. I have all the other Miyazaki films on DVD and I never listen to the dubbed track. Listening to the Japanese track has it's charms since everything about the movie and the way everything and everyone work to make movie great make sense when listening to the original track. That goes for everything, not just Miyazaki's movies or anime in general.    So if you are a Japanese anime fan and are used to listening to the original track be aware that the Japanese track is in Dolby Digital and not DTS-HD Master Audio. Only the English dub is in DTS-HD Master Audio. I must also say that I am extremely disappointed that Disney made this gigantic mistake when making the Blu-ray. I can only hope that won't do the same mistake when issuing the other Miyazaki movies on Blu-ray. Learn from Pioneer when they issued a truly magnificent release of Akira!
B00005JPKE|5.0|Eastwood's masterpiece is among my all-time favorite films.  Unlike most war films, there are no enemies, little heroism and no political theme.  While the soldiers depicted were noble and proud, we're left wondering: `Where did that get them?'<br /><br />The story behind the film is as interesting as the movie itself.  In researching Gen. Kuribayashi for `Flags of Our Fathers', Eastwood was fascinated by his story, pitched the movie, hired a writer and shot the film in a short period of time.<br /><br />The movie features 2 of the most compelling characters ever presented on film: Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a grunt, and Kuribayashi (Ken Wantanabe), his general.  Wantanabe is magnificent and his performance is equalled. Ninomiya's portrayal of the likable, young soldier is Oscar-worthy.  `LFIJ' is a war film set in the heart of a battle, but these 2 men are bigger than this war.
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|During a summer in 1975, Dave Boyle and two friends, Jimmy and Sean, are playing on a sidewalk in Boston when Dave is abducted by two men and subjected to sexual abuse over a period of several days. Eventually escaping, but haunted into adulthood by his trauma, Dave becomes a primary suspect when Jimmy's daughter, Katie, is found murdered. Sean, assigned to investigate the crime, finds himself facing both demons from the past and demons in the present as the circumstances surrounding Katie's death are uncovered. \\"Mystic River\\" is a surprisingly dark movie, with a controversial denouement. It is masterfully directed, acted, shot, edited, lit and scored. It is a mostly humorless and occasionally difficult realist drama, that will undoubtedly affect most viewers emotionally in a variety of ways. The story is absorbing. \\"Mystic River\\" is a impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.
0451197879|5.0|I ordered this for my military son serving in the middle east. Amazon went into high speed to get this to him. I ordered some things for myself, the same day and his package arrived on the other side of the world before I got mine! This is a good thing!  Thanks, Amazon for supporting the troops. You always sent the APO packages out faster to make sure he got them!!!
B002UJIY7A|4.0|For their honeymoon, newlyweds Cliff and Cydney head to the tropical islands of Hawaii. While journeying through the paradisaical countryside the couple encounters Kale and Cleo, two disgruntled hitchhikers and Nick and Gina, two wild but well-meaning spirits who help guide them through the lush jungles. The picturesque waterfalls and scenic mountainsides quickly give way to terror when Cliff and Cydney learn of a grisly murder that occurred nearby and realize that they're being followed by chance acquaintances that suspiciously fit the description of the killers. \\"A Perfect Getaway\\" is nowhere near a perfect movie, but it is certainly a good movie. The majority of the movie centers around paranoia. It is true though that the plot twist can be seen coming from a mile away, but how it is delivered is where it succeeds.  How the twist are presented is quite original and chill-inducing. All the actors really give it their best and create believable characters. Overall, it's worth the watch and is ultimately very entertaining with wonderful characters.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Mature, beautiful, relatable, etc. I can not really find the words to explain just how truly lovely I think this young artist and her music is. I purchased this CD back in November. I had not heard of her but thought that the samples on Amazon were nice. I was pleasantly surprised. I then went back online to read her short bio. and was even more impressed to learn that even after her tragic accident, she has held her head high and was still able to do what she loved to do - make music and sing. I listen to this CD everyday - on my way to work, on my way home, around the house doing chores, etc. I even got my husband listening to it from time to time. I have purchased her \\"Worrisome\\" CD as well, however, \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" is my personal favorite. Can't wait til her next album. I would recommend this CD to anyone. You will not be disappointed.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I'm a pride and prejudice SNOB!!! I don't appreciate anything but the book and  the A&E version with Jennifer Ehle. I seriously considered picketing the theaters when the Keira Knightly version came out. So, this review is for people like me.    \\"Lost in austen\\" is the first thing I've seen that I haven't turned off in disgust. It's saving grace is that the main character, the girl who gets \\"lost\\" in Austen, is also a P&P snob with regards to the book and the A&E version. This matters because she comments on the fact that its not \\"the original.\\" Her acknowledgment makes it okay somehow. For example, when she first meets Mr. Darcy, she says \\"Well, he's no Colin Firth.\\" As she's screwing everything up, she realizes it.    Not sure if that came across as I meant it to. The main point is that this series gave me more of P&P (which is always good), without making me want to hunt down those that made it and lecture them on how they need to keep their mitts off anything Austen.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|1st, if you haven't seen Boondock Saints, my condolances.    It is one of the best action/shoot-em-ups ever made but in a light hearted/non dark kind of way.    Go buy or downlaod it today.    Now, to Boondock Saints 2 : All Saints Day    Just About the entire original cast returns, including all of the main characters (albeit a couple in much much smaller roles)and most of the secondary characters.    My 1st thought was ...WOW! these guys look ancient now.    Duffy should have done the sequel 5 years ago.    It was a very good follow-up, as it didn't straw too far from the elements that made BS1 a great movie.    The film looked good for BluRay and had a good soundtrack and sound effects.    The acting was pretty good and the new characters carried their own weight, but the story did not seem as fresh and original as the 1st.    It could have been horrible, but it was definitely worth the price of admission, with the realese date Low Price Guarantee from Amazon.    I believe they left the door open for a 3 installment, but let's hope it's made in the next 2 years.    Now go watch BS2 on BluRay!
B00328G4V6|5.0|Tie dyed Hendrix fans have been given a rare treat with this album.  This isn't the typical hack-n-slash release of Jimi's so-called \\"lost recordings\\" that have tainted his legacy for the last forty years.  This is genuine material that was intended for his listeners ears--but sadly collected dust until now.<br /><br />Kudos to the engineers who mixed and mastered these tracks--they sound hauntingly modern--probably not a difficult feat considering todays technology--I think Jimi would have been suitably impressed.<br /><br />It may take some time for fans to get used to the new versions of \\"Stone Free\\" and \\"Fire\\", but if the liner notes can be believed, this is the way Hendrix intended them to sound originaly.  It's left to the imagination how he would've approached the rest of his backlog had he still been around.<br /><br />But in the end, the best thing about this new material is that it's going to take guitarists another four decades of arguing and debate as to how to properly play this stuff!!<br /><br />Bottom line:  Buy it.  If you worship at the alter of Jimi, you're gonna love it.

B001E2JNA6|4.0|Im not going to review this particular production, theres over 1700 reviews here already what can I say that has not been said. So I will rather do a comparison between this Firth version and the later version which I will call the knightley version. So allow me pray to copy over what I reveiwed there:<br /><br />I bought both versions at the same time the Firth 1995 and the Knightley version. Which to watch first was my initial dilemma. I decided on the above shorter 2hr. Knightley version first and it was the right decision after having now watched watched both versions. Unlike any devout P&P fan and not having seen either versions before, I at least can watch it for what it is without any pre-conceived notions. It wasnt long into watching this version which I will call the Knightley version, that I noticed a problem with the sound. I couldnt work out if it was me, the player or the transfer. Five to ten minutes in and I said to myself I cant the heck make out what theyre talking about. Dialogue was drowned out by over-powering background music and ran so fast. I had no choice but to start it again and put the subtitles on which as pointed out by another reviewer were often 3 liners and placed which was a nuisance. For that alone I had to drop 1 star when I would have awarded it 5 stars.<br /><br />Sure there was 'Poetic License' taken in this Knightley version. Like theyre manor was more like a farmhouse and very rough and hardly an upper middle to high class. Donald Sutherland though a great actor imho didnt suit his part, he hardly resembled the English Gentleman of his time, more like Colonial America civil war period. These things aside I found the Knightley version to be more dynamic then the Firth version. This version gave more goose bumps, lumps in throat and emotional tears. Knightley was perfect in her role she was more dynamic and head strong then in previos version. What you didnt see in this 2 hr.version I saw in the Firth version to fill in the gaps. Which is why I decided on the right version to start of my viewing. So all in all, dont miss this version, it was beautiful even with some of its flaws. It is as I say far more dynamic then the previous Firth version. I also preferred Darcy in this version.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful at all please vote on it. Thanks. Pleasant viewing.I decided on the right version to start of my viewing. So all in all, dont miss this version, it was beautiful even with some of its flaws.

B00275EGWY|3.0|After reading some of the other reviews, I thought I'd write one of my own.      If you haven't seen this film and you're looking for an action film that isn't too deep and doesn't force-feed you a political message, then this film will fit that requirement.  If you're expecting an accurate portrayal of an EOD specialist in Iraq or what life is like for the military on a day-to-day basis, I don't think this is it.      I know the movie has been touted by critics to be very realistic.  There are many factors that may have contributed to this claim of realism.  The movie does omit many of the long-time Hollywood standards, like trampoline jumps and spittoon-sounding ricochets.  The absence of these acrobatics and unrealistic sounds might make it seem more realistic to viewers.      The way injuries were portrayed was more realistic than you might find in other action/war movies of the same genre.  Unlike Rambo films where all injuries are superficial, when someone was wounded in this film, that person didn't get up in the next scene and act like the life-threatening wounds he'd received minutes ago were mere scratches.  Someone with a leg injury actually had to go to the hospital and couldn't use that leg to walk, run, or deliver a roundhouse kick to a bad guy and a guy standing next to an exploding device was actually killed, not just flipped into the air.      The movie also avoids making a definitive political message.  Even if in reality, soldiers often vocalize their political views, the makers of the film didn't use the characters as a mouthpiece for their own political views, which I think is a positive point.  I think the film neither glamorizes war or makes soldiers look like bloodthirsty murderers.      I think it's also fair to say that the movie pointed out that being in EOD requires a special kind of personality; someone who goes toward the source of imminent danger while everyone else is headed the other way.  At the same time, the techniques the protagonist (SFC James) used to dismantle explosives was pure Hollywood.  The movie didn't have the trope-laden red wire/blue wire dilemma or the over-used plot device where a bomb's timer stops with one second to spare, but I don't think any current or former EOD specialist would say that the techniques shown in the film are even remotely accurate, especially carelessly pulling on wires with enough force to uproot a series of artillery rounds.    The dialogue and character development were both fairly good.  The movie avoided the cheap one-liners so popular these days and also didn't stereotype any of the characters.  Each person had his own qualities and set of problems, some of which get resolved and others that don't.  The characters' interactions with one another were believable.  I did have a hard time relating to the protagonist, though, mostly because of his inability to recognize what was wrong with disregarding the safety of the men in his unit while he was playing cowboy and doing his own thing.  Later in the film, it's revealed that he had some compassion for the men he works with, but this doesn't make up for the times he needlessly endangers them, even if it does seem to work out for him (more or less).      With all that being said, I don't think it was a horrible film if taken at face value, but I also don't think it is an eye-opening new look at the war in Iraq or a snapshot of the day-to-day dangers faced in combat.

Only this time I added to my title review the words 'Magical and Etherial' for it truly is as such. Furthermore re the sound short comings. I viewed it this time without the annoying subtitles and came to the conclusion that whilst the production starts almost with a ball which drowned the dialogue I thereafter was able to go along with the dialogue as I say without the subtitles and was better off for it. One still may miss some dialogue as it is still an imperfect sound, but better to take in all the splendour then concentrate on reading every word of the subtitle. My main gripe is that this production should have been longer with at least 3 hours. Especially missing is a wedding scene in its finale and makes ruse with dialogue depicting post marriage. Nevertheless truly magical and NOT to be missed.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful at all please vote on it. Thanks. Pleasant viewing.ley version yet once again.

B002YCVX5S|1.0|A really stupid movie -- not even bad.  And technically flawed in that the subtitles flash by far faster than they can be read.  Neither the Nazis were that stupid nor the French underground that arrogant.
0807014273|5.0|Today's society needs positive books, that value life not by it's usefulness but by it's meaning.  This is one of those books.  The testimony part is awesome, leaves little chance to argue that a life full of suffering shouldn't be lived.  The logotherapy introduction part is very interesting and enlightening, although I had some bumps with the technical stuff, but that's nothing that google can't handle :)  Buy it, read it and share it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Having always maintained an interest in literature for young people, I have from time to time had my interest especially and surprisingly piqued by a particular book.  So it was with The Lightning Thief.     The eleven year old grandson of a friend was totally immersed in his book, oblivious to the chatter from lots of family and friends around him.  I asked to see what he was reading and he reluctantly handed it over.  Literally within seconds I was pulled into the story, so much so that later I downloaded it to my Kindle so I could read it at my leisure.    Basically, the story is that a young boy learns that he is half human, half descendant of an ancient Greek god.  The story is important, yes, but Riordan's skill at blending the modern with the ancient is truly amazing.  Everything is plausible, believable.  Nowhere did I say, \\"Aw, that just doesn't work!\\"    Another practical level of the story that is valuable is the idea that a dyslexic young boy from a dysfunctional family can draw from within himself the strength to deal with adversity. Highly recommended for the quality of writing, the fascinating story, and the lesson it teaches.
2839905809|5.0|This book is just plain fun to read and work with. Clear examples of the tools described and understandable methods to work with the models.

076790592X|5.0|[[ASIN:076790592X Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson]]  Review by Richard L. Weaver II, PhD.    Mitch Albom's very popular 192-page book, Tuesdays with Morrie, can be enjoyed on a variety of levels. First, if you've ever had a great teacher, it is a wonderful and touching dialog between teacher and student. Second, the philosophical insights, wisdom, and simple life lessons Morrie Schwartz, a sociology professor at Brandies University, dispenses throughout the book are excellent, basic lessons on how to live. Third, you experience, along with Albom, Morrie's declining health (he's dying from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease)), and it is an honest and straightforward lesson in how to die. Fourth, you learn from this experience that human relationships and health are more important than all the gadgets, modern conveniences, and the other trivialities that occupy our lives. Fifth, you enjoy the special connection that can take place between a spiritual mentor and a pupil. Sixth, you will be reading a book that will touch your heart in a deep and meaningful way. This is a short, inspirational book (It takes 2-4 hours to read), with the most important truth being: you learn to live by learning to die. The other truths include the necessity of devoting yourself to loving others, devoting yourself to your community, and devoting yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning. What's interesting about this book --- a type I tend to avoid, for the most part (it was recommended to me by my wife) --- is that \\"it lives up to all the hype!\\" It is a classic, and it will continue to be a bestseller for a long time. I highly recommend it.
B002JODV3S|4.0|What an incredible performance Steve Vai lays down on Where the Wild Things Are. 2 hours and 40 minutes worth of incredibleness!!!! And wait a minute....a rock concert with violins??? Let's just put it this way: you will think about violinists in a whole new (heavy metal???) light after you watch violinists Alex DePue and Ann Marie Calhoun shred their violins on the second song of the DVD. Vai and the rest of his band (including bassist Bryan Beller, drummer Jeremy Colson & guitarist Dave Weiner) put on an energy filled show in Minneapolis throughout the 27 songs on the DVD (well, 26 really, plus a band intro track).<br /><br />So why 4 instead of 5 stars? A memo really needs to go out to all bands and music DVD producers that says at minimum: \\"1) Music DVD's should be produced to the highest standards. 2) The musical performances within should represent the talent that made the studio recorded CDs sell. 3) Theatrics are very cool too, as long as you can pull them off without deterioration in the quality of the music.\\" Vai (he produced the DVD too) gets high marks on all 3 aspects with a few unfortunate, stand-out flaws.<br /><br />Let's break it down then for Where the Wild Things Are:<br /><br />1 - \\"Music DVD's should be produced to the highest standards.\\" - It's here and only here that Where the Wild Things Are has its flaws. The main issue is with the picture quality. It was recorded in 720p, but it doesn't look like it. There seems to be some kind of lens filter that really took away from the effect of feeling like I was in the front row of the concert versus watching it on TV. I've watched A LOT of music DVDs, most recently [[ASIN:B001NP8PRG Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's]], so I know with the right lighting a DVD can be produced to have the effect that you're not looking at your TV and more like you're looking through a magic window from the front row of the concert. But Vai's Where the Wild Things Are for whatever reason seems to be a Grade B picture. The picture is good; it's just I've seen much much better. The DVD was recorded in 2007, so there is no excuse for a good versus excellent picture quality. The average picture is not noticeable on a standard def TV, but it's very noticeable on a high def plasma TV. I think that just \\"flat\\" would be a good way to describe it.<br /><br />The visuals are well-directed and \\"mostly\\" don't jump all over the place every 2 seconds. There is some of that though, and it's very annoying. For some reason the notion is that quickly changing the visual projects the energy of a song...and that's a stupid notion. The camera shots in Where the Wild Things Are \\"mostly\\" give you nice long looks at each performer at the right time; if you were actually at the show, you'd probably be looking at the performer that the camera is on. But every now and then it switched to the quick look editing that killed the illusion of having a front row seat to the show. There were also too many of out of place cheesy video effects; no one wants to see distracting video effects over performance. I just don't understand how that silliness ever finds its way into the final cut of a DVD concert release. There were even some occasional messages that crossed the screen (for example a handwritten note apologizing to a roadie for tripping over him). All of this being a complete hindrance to the enjoyment of the awesome Vai performance.<br /><br />The sound on Where the Wild Things are is amazing. A thunderous Dolby 5.1 recording will shake your whole house if you're set up for surround. If not, I suggest listening to this through headphones if your DVD player or TV has the output. Talk about feeling like you're at the show?...Just crank up your theater system's volume or use headphones and you'll feel like you're sitting right on the stage with Vai and company.<br /><br />2 - \\"The musical performances within should represent the talent that made the studio recorded CDs sell.\\" - The band prior to hitting the stagedefinitely committed to each other to go out and play the tightest show ever. Regarding playing the songs to represent how they sound on the CD? I can name only 2 Steve Vai songs by name: The Audience is Listening and The Attitude Song, and of the two songs only The Audience is Listening is included in the show. I've included the track listing below, but would you really know any of the songs by their titles? I mean a devoted Vai fan probably would, but I've never even heard any of these compositions until I saw them on the DVD. The 2 hour and 40 minute (mostly) instrumental show (Steve, please, don't sing) on Where the Wild Things Are gets a kind of pass on being true to the CD. For an instrumental show the standard is more about playing the songs as tight as or better than what's on the CDs. And Via and company came through in spades.<br /><br />3 - \\"Theatrics are very cool too, as long as you can pull them off without deterioration in the quality of the music.\\" - Unless you call Steve Vai's signature exaggerated facial expressions, prance and swagger theatrics, there are really no over-the-top theatrics at all in the performance...which is great! The band just totally rocks out and plays the music, and as I said earlier, they perform everything to perfection.<br /><br />So to sum it up, Where the Wild Things Are is killer. But if you wanted to experience it on Blu Ray in 1080p, you don't get that high def picture that you might have expected from a 2009 Blu Ray release. However, the performance is superb and really shows that Vai is one of the most talented guitarists ever. The performance makes Where the Wild Things Are more than worth the purchase.

1400062756|3.0|[[ASIN:1400062756 Mindset: The New Psychology of Success]]  Review by Richard L. Weaver II, PhD.    Mindset is based on more than 20 years of research into personality, intelligence, and development, and it isn't her theme that caught my attention.  What I found captivating is that in her book she identified two distinct approaches to life, with powerful implications.\\" This is how Billings explains Dweck's bifurcation (dividing all of human behavior into two aspects):    \\"Those who believe that intelligence is God-given or intrinsic (the fixed mindset) are likely to stagnate, while those who think that aptitude is flexible and honed through experience (the growth mindset) tend to flourish and thrive\\" (p. 37).    Why is this piece of information so important? There are two reasons. First, throughout my professional career I have written and given speeches about motivation--how to be motivated and how to motivate others. Whether or not people are motivated is determined by mindset.    For persuaders, this is one piece of demographic information that might help them approach their listeners, because they would know, in advance, which listeners would be more likely to be affected or moved by their message.    Second, it offers a method of self-evaluation. That is, if you discovered which mindset best characterizes your own approach to life, in the first case it would provide information that would be self-explanatory. That is, it may reveal why you are unwilling to reach out, face challenges, and risk failure. It may reveal why you are more likely to protect yourself, seek security, and guard your safety. Your inability (or lack of desire) to face the unknown can be motivated by a desire to defend your vulnerability or to insulate yourself from danger.    If you discovered, instead, that aptitude is flexible and honed through experience, you would be able to build on this knowledge by taking further steps that would contribute to your growth, development, and change. Itmay explain how your personal program of reaching out, facing challenges, and risking failure directly correlates with your success and happiness. What a terrific incentive for continuing your program.    This equation is insightful. Also, it is invaluable for its self-motivating, self-determining, self-sufficiency.    The problem with the bifurcation that Dweck offers, of course, has the very same drawback as any bifurcation. Life tends to be made up of shades of gray and not aspects best defined by the starkness of black and white.    The problem can best be explained by saying that in situations where you feel qualified and knowledgeable, you are willing to take risks and face challenges. In traveling, for example, you may seek out unusual locations off the beaten track. In situations, however, where you are unqualified and less knowledgeable, you are less likely to take a risk or face a challenge. For example, you might be a terrible politician or lobbyist and rather than stick your neck out, you would rather crawl into a hole and hibernate.    Circumstances, too, would dictate the rate of speed by which success and happiness might occur. In some situations, growth and change would happen rapidly and with ease because you felt comfortable, encouraged it, and were determined.    One clear conclusion from reading Dweck's book, Mindset, is that mindsets are not set in stone. Thank goodness, because rigid thinking benefits no one. Thank goodness, too, because mindsets create our whole mental world. They not only explain how we become optimistic or pessimistic, shape our goals, determine our attitude toward work and relationships, affect how we raise our kids, and predict whether or not we will fulfill our potential, they are the path of opportunity and success.
141690977X|2.0|So, I read this on the recommendation of a few good friends who said that, even if I didn't necessarily need the self-help side of it, I would still find it amusing.    I didn't.    It's all so obvious and so done to death.  I couldn't even get through it all.
0316017922|3.0|[[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]]  Review by Richard L. Weaver II, PhD.    In his 320-page book (only 180 of text according to one reviewer's estimate), Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell, a professional writer, has woven together an exceedingly interesting story. He is a terrific writer, a fact well illustrated in both Blink and The Tipping Point. His thesis is that to be successful in life, upbringing, culture, luck, and privilege matter. He debunks the myth that high intelligence or where you were educated are of concern. Success has everything to do with \\"practical intelligence,\\" along with your willingness to put in the 10,000 hours of practice required to reach mastery in your field. The information related to \\"practical intelligence\\" can be found in Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence (a book I highly recommend). If you aren't familiar with some of Gladwell's ideas or topics, you will find this book a good introduction or starting point. If you're looking for a book that includes original research, deep analysis, or the support of other writers and thinkers on the topic (e.g., opinions, quotations, testimony, or references), this is not the book for you because Gladwell is not a social scientist, nor is he a journalist or deep thinker. However, if its a light, fluffy read to which you are attracted, this might be a good choice.

B000002OZY|4.0|Grew up in the 50s/60s, did some DJing, so this is one of my favorites.  The quintessential \\"Rock Opera\\" that's just good rock music, opera or not.  Maybe it's my old ears: the recording was slightly flat (Bose speakers, Onkyo amp), but the music is just as exciting now as then.  Despite the moderately good movie, the music remains the heart of this album.  The story line is a little adult with a side dish of sociology that doesn't diminish the rock.  Guitar riffs few can play.  Forget the \\"opera\\", just enjoy the \\"rock\\".
0688145078|5.0|We've been reading this book to our 2 1/2 year old son a few times a week for a few months now to prepare him for the impending arrival of his younger brother/sister.  He loves the book, the illustrations and writing are great and we couldn't be more pleased with it.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|What a nice surprise discovering this sci-fi gem in our video-shop, fully and masterfully restored.    I saw this movie, starring a VERY young Bruce Willis, with my father in the early eighties.    Being totally freaked out by the movie, my first sci-fi experience at the age of 10 years, I remember my father saying: \\"You just watch that youngster Bruce Willis -- one day he will be a super star. (Little did I know...)    Only today, almost 30 years later, I can really appreciate the scientific insight the producers showed at the time:    1. Most of the vehicles in the movie resembles 2006+ models -- its almost scary that the futuristic cars that impressed me so much as a kid, turned out to be spot-on in their design.    2. Look out when a memory stick is used with the computers -- what an amazing insight of the designers who did the graphics.    3. Kudos to the make-up-artists who 'aged' Bruce Willis so masterfully that even this Die-Hard-fan cannot tell the difference between the 'aged' Bruce and the present-day-Bruce.    I am just gratefull that the Secrete Weapon to kill off the surrogates AND their Controllers (humans), only materialized as a Taser in real life!, which kills humans with heart problems only. -- but again, what an insight the writer had into the future.    This DVD is a must have in any sci-fi-collection.

0670021652|5.0|As much as I enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love, I was relieved to read Committed, which (after the first few pages) provides another volume of Elizabeth Gilbert's delightful, humorous and insightful writing by a more grown-up woman. I shared the opening of Eat, Pray, Love with the writing class I'm teaching in Jerusalem, but realized that Committed was too advanced for these young adults. Why should they care about the challenges of marriage? But we grown-up's who know marriage from the inside will appreciate the deep thinking, the research Gilbert has so thoughtfully digested for us, and the optimism that superpowers this book. Not to mention the tension between exotic and commonplace which marks the relationship between this newly minted couple. Brava!
B000000JO3|4.0|a vision of youth and the perpetual societal objects of temptation that threaten to spoil it. naive, awkward and even sanctimonious (although they never attempted to indoctrinate), but musically tenacious and brutally sincere. raw, short songs that threaten to crumble apart at any moment. wild leadwork that sizzles over what was some of the fastest and most furious rhythm playing at the time. minor threat's stand-apart attitude was not for show; they lampooned the conformity and stagnant ideals of even the \\"punk\\" scene in which they could have more easily found solace, although that went over most people's heads.
0812973992|2.0|I anticipated that this book would be excellent, based on reviews.  However; I was badly disapointed.  Some of the short stories were interesting, but, most were based too much on the characters introspection and thoughts with very little real story.   Jack Bryan
B0029O08WA|4.0|I bought this soundtrack because I wanted the song that was played durring Bella's depression - when three months blur together for her. That song (\\"Possibility\\" by Lykke Li) is genious for that portion of the movie! So, after listening to that song repeatedly I continued to let the CD play while driving my kids around in the car. Most of the other songs on the CD are great. It doesn't hurt that I love New Moon and tie the songs to the parts they played in the movie. :o) A definite purchase for a New Moon movie fan.

B000WS4QJG|2.0|Let me say that I love the Thriller album, even if it seems a tad dated now. If you have the original CD of Thriller, hang onto it.  It has better sound and more dynamic range than the 2001 or 2008 remastered CD's.  Don't be fooled thinking remastered is better. All they do is turn everything up so it sounds louder, which in effect distorts and you lose the important dynamic range. Don't believe me? Have another listen to your remastered CD and notice how blaringly loud it is, and how much detail is lost.  Also have a look at this interesting YOUTUBE discussion on Thriller remastered.  You'll never buy another remastered CD again:  [...]
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really enjoy this video. Jillian MIchaels is tough, but I figure that I can handle it for 20 minutes. I love that she does strength, cardio and abs. It's perfect. I feel so much better after I have done this video.
B00328G4V6|5.0|This brand new Jimi Hendrix Album, I say is not \\"unreleased material\\",but rather GREAT studio masters of unofficially released material via bootlegs and other posthumous albums. That being said, I think this is a great album,maybe a notch below \\"Are You Experienced\\" or \\"Electric Ladyland\\" but still great! Alot more Blues Jam oriented than psychedelic, but outstanding production,very clear modern sounding cuts and Hendrix singing and guitar playing is superb!
B001VZY4MS|5.0|Everything others have said about this album is true: it is an excellent album from Neil's phase when he still sought memorable, original melodies and sounds. All I can add is that what may pass for slightly quaint conceits now (although no less listenable for that), such as opening the album with an instrumental, countrified thing, or letting Jack Nitzsche go to town on String Quartet From Whiskey Boot Hill with a contemporary (read: occasionally atonal) chamber music interlude, was innovative at the time of its creation, and made everyone feel like there was still hope for the progress of rock.   Now on to my little annoying thing. The good news is that this remaster is truly a remaster, a warm, \\"round\\"-sounding one well worth the money, unlike the myriad remasters where you sit dumbfounded and wonder where the difference with the previous release is, and where your money has gone. The one teensy thing that bothers me is that the loudness levels don't seem to be equal from song to song. Right off the bat, you'll want to hear The Emperor of Wyoming louder than The Loner, which follows it. Granted, the first one is soft and leans toward violins, the second is a pretty hard rocker with a typical Neil-fuzzed electric guitar and the killer 60's organ; they are naturally different-sounding songs, but I'd have thought that was precisely what remasters were for: to find the best possible balance for all songs on the album (among other things).  I don't know if this is the case for all four in this initial series of remasters: I started at the beginning, we'll see where this leads, but I do hope the levels are more consistent on the remaining albums.
B002HNAAZ8|4.0|Danger Danger is a band that have released some great albums in the past and have been a cornerstone of the melodic rock style for 20 years. This new album sounds awesome with a nice fat production and the welcome return of Ted Poley's vocals to the music. The CD booklet and cover looks very professional too. Although the music is very well produced some of the songs are a little hit and miss for me and some of the lyrics are a bit cheesy. Ted Poley has brought that happy vibe back to the music of Danger Danger and everyone I have shown this music to gets a big smile on their face and wants to sing along. His vocal style and melodies are some of the best ever and he shines throughout the album. The track \\"Killing Love\\" is excellent and the ballad \\"Fugitive\\" is great too. The song \\"Keep On Keepin' On\\" is pure vintage Danger Danger and \\"Dirty Mind\\" brings back memories of Diving For Pearls classic debut. Overall I think diehard fans of D2 will love this - highly recommended to fans of happy melodic rock!

B002FOQY2M|5.0|I discovered this band thanks to free sample downloads on Amazon's MP3 store, and I'm delighted that I did.  What a wonderful album.  Well-crafted songs that are the embodiment of excellent pop.  This band sounds as if they are channeling the Beatles, Squeeze, ELO, and Queen, yet are fully modern and original.  This is easily one of the best new records I've listened to in the past couple of years.  What a refreshing change from boring albums where every song sounds the same and the band sounds the same as every other band.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I highly recommend this dvd. It is worthy. I like it because the exercises are very simple and easy to follow. There are two other girls beside the instructor and you can follow either of them, depending if you are beginner or advanced.  Just beware!!! If you think you are advanced but haven't train regularly, watch out with the beginning. I have to say the first time I did the training sesion 1, I consider myself as a person that do exercise regularly but after that sesion, the next day my whole body ached hahaha. That is why just take it slow and build the strength little by little. For the rest, Im very happy with the product.  The only thing I would improve is the warm-up which I consider too short, but what I do, it is just to stop the video and make the warming-up exercise for a bit longer and then it is ok.
B002W24E0G|4.0|I read somewhere a description of this album that said something along the lines of it sounds like Little Richard being backed by the Ramones with production by Phil Spector. Sounds about right after you hear it.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Excellent show. My whole family enjoys watching legend of the seeker I can't wait for season 2.
B000669GAI|3.0|This is a pretty good compilation of songs for the casual Pearl Jam fan. This two CD set contains more than their big hits that people have heard on the radio. However, hardcore fans (such as myself) will probably have all of these songs anyway. If you are anything like me, you already have all of their albums and have probably created your own personal \\"Best of\\" compilation. So if you just kind of like PJ or are not sure if you would like PJ, then get this set. But people who absolutely love PJ should just get all of their albums and decide for yourself which songs are their \\"Greatest Hits.\\"

0385737947|1.0|This book had an intriguing idea but failed to convey any worth. I picked this book for my book club and was sorely disappointed. It took all my energy just to finish it because it was uninteresting but the made up language made it irritating too. With this subject, this book could have been a great book but wasn't. If you want a book like this done well - try Hunger Games or Ender's Game.

0307454541|5.0|Salander, the transcendent female character created by Steig Larson, is a breakthrough for female literary protagonists.  What's more - she's really fun to read about.  Larson tells an compelling story in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  The story is set in Sweden amidst the financial & magazine publishing world.  Blomkvist, a most likable reporter, has been recently busted for a journalist no-no.  Apparently, he wrote an article full of charges against a formidable company that he simply can not prove.  In his despair, he takes an unlikely job, working for the head of a major corporation who wants Blomkvist to write his family's memoirs as a ruse to uncovering some family secrets long since buried.<br /><br />As Blomkvist starts to make progress on the mystery, upsetting the extended family in the process, and finds himself in need of the very specific skills of Salander.  They meet, they work together and they tussle a bit.  Read the book to see how this unlikely pair attempt to solve the mystery and turn their own personal and professional lives around in the process.<br /><br />The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is perfectly paced and painstakingly developed mystery complete with suspense and romance.  You are going to love it.  Luckily the Salander character makes a reappearance in Larson next two books.  Lucky us!
1449528279|5.0|Fantastic female characters juxtaposed to each other, somewhat reminded me of the characters of Cousin Bette, Scarlett O'hara and Melanie from Gone with the Wind.  Sharp criticism of the British aristocratic culture of the 19th Century in a deliciously twisted/cynical way.  Great writing \\"...for so it was that Becky felt the Vanity of human affairs, and it was in those securities that she would have liked to cast anchor\\"\\"...I believe that remorse is the least active of all a man's moral senses---the very easiest to be deadened when wakened: and in some never wakened at all.  We grieve at being found out, and at the idea of shame or punishment; but the mere sense of wrong makes very few people unhappy in Vanity Fair.\\"
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|I imagine that many of those who don't like this film don't get it. It's not an easy film to \\"get the gist of\\". You have to watch it and pay attention to the details. Like one reviewer said, the name of the vessel, Aelous, plays into the plot. Also listen up when a character tells the story of Sisyphus, the man condemned to roll a rock up a hill, only to have it roll back down. There are other hints along the way.     It's hard to review this film without giving out a ton of spoilers. The whole movie is based on spoilers! I think I liked it because it was so unpredictable, unlike a lot of movies these days.    Let me tell you one thing that may be considered a spoiler- or maybe not. There are two, not one, but two \\"rolling the rock up the hill\\" plots in this story! I think many will get the one- but the second one is more subtle.     The effects are good, the acting decent, and the plot twisty- almost Twilight-Zone-ish.     Take a chance on this one.
0810994739|5.0|Awesome book - my son is almost finished with it and can't wait for the movie to come out.  THANKS!!
0307271862|3.0|This author splits his story into three factions. There is a Swedish part with a female judge as the protagonist.  If the story had stayed with her the whole way, this would have been a brilliant book. However, the author abruptly shifts us to this convoluted Chinese story of oppression from the time when the railroads were being built in the United States in the West. This is the worst part of the book.  Better is when we meet the descendants of these railroad workers in present day China.  That is eventually tied into the Swedish story.  Just to demonstrate how bad a misstep this detour into the historical USA portion was, I kept flipping ahead the pages to see how much more of it I would have to wade through to get back to the \\"real\\" story. Then I would groan at how many more pages of it were left.  The present day Chinese stuff was fine and if we had simply melded that with the Swedish story then this book may have fulfilled its opening promise.<br /><br />Readers may be looking for another Millenium Trilogy with this book.

B000NA28I4|1.0|<<<Spoilers>>>  ugh this movie bugged the crap out of me ive read the books and i loved them so i was so excited to see the movie!  it sucked!!!   First ill point out the little things that just got on my nerves because it really wouldnt have been hard to change.  1) Arya's hair is black not blond!  2) Eragon's hair is dark brown NOT BLOND!   3)Arya didn't even have pointed ears and she doesn't get poisoned by durza dropping some voodoo crap on her chest!  4)If Arya was awake and fine like when brom was dying she could have saved him! Shes an elf! shes supposed to be powerful! If she can send an egg miles and miles away she should be able to cure a little cut!!  UGH!! i know im picking it apart but i just need to get this off my chest...  5)Sapphira got her name from brom telling eragon names and it never mentioned that it was broms dragons name too! i thought that would have made a little bond there even and made Broms death a little more significant.  6)when eragon gets sliced by durza in the back it doesn't even phase him when he wakes up!   7)Brom gets killed by Durza?!? it was the Ra'zac! and the Ra'zac are supposed to look so much different and aren't supposed to die or be easy to even fight and live in that matter!   Goodness! these are just little things that irritated me i could make a massive list of everything they screwed up but i dont think they all could fit in this review box!   They cut so much out its ridiculous i was soooo disappointed!   Don't waste your money on buying it. If you want to see it that bad, rent it!
B002S0OBN2|5.0|my first review & may i say...<br />I love this musical! it's dark, hauntingly & melodically beautiful.<br />i read the book phantom of Manhattan 3 years ago,the story was excellent.I thought the reviews for it were awful... \\"waste of time & money\\" oh please if hate it don't say it & let people think for themselves!<br />the musical i thought would be odd but i saw the video till i hear you sing on a Russian video web site & fell in love with it.<br />the musical is a coaster of emotions with lyrical beginning & to the dramatic end. This sequel is worth hearing & not like most musicals today.<br />Okay on with the plot... it starts out with the ballet mistress madame giry looking at now the deserted coney island,<br />a bird woman appears saying \\"but i know you come back madame giry\\".so the two sing about the dreams,fantasies<br />of it. We're taken back in time to 1907 the opening of coney island,meg worries the phantom will not see her  but sings out the crowd that's it only for you. now we go into the depths of the opera ex composer new lair where the phantom say \\"ten long years living a mere fascade of life ten long years wasting my time on smoke and nosie in my mind i hear meledoies pure and unearthly but i cant give them a voice without you...\\" then he sings about Christine the women whom he thinks of and loves & feels her voice is the only way he'll feel whole again is hearing her sing once more for him(till i hear you sing).The ballet mistress dauther meg arrives saying\\"did you like the new routine...was the costume too revealing maybe can show more.\\" madame giry knows he's thinking about Christine,she says she'd betrayed,shunned&left for Raoul for beauty & youth.<br />The phantom has heard enough of her and says you'll be paid as i promise you would now if you have anything else left to say... he refrims his dream to us singing a repise of til i hear you sing by the end the phantom sings \\"and come what may i swear somehow someway i will hear you sing... once more\\"!!!<br />Next sence disloves to a boat docking where Christine,Raoul and their ten-year-old son Gustave arrive in New York and are stormed by paparazzi. They are greeted by the freaks, who arrive by a carriage that moves by it self, To take them to Coney Island(\\"Are you ready to begin?\\").It's night time and in their hotel room where Raoul is angry at the reception and upsets Gustave by not playing with him. As Raoul leaves to go drinking, Christine tells Gustave to \\"Look with your heart\\" to try to help him understand. Gustave goes to bed, and the Phantom arrives to recount a night of passion they shared the night before her wedding (\\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\").the phantom asks her what about now her reply \\"there is no now\\". then she sings\\"Once upon another time\\" when she thought their love had a chance of succeeding.their romantic momment is short by Gustave having a nightmare he meets The Phantom for the first time and promises to show him more of Phantasma.Then he tells Christine that she must sing for him again or she will return home without the boy. Next we find christine with her son and meets her friend meg who is a vaudeville singer and Raoul encounters Giry and discovers that the Phantom is the one for whom Christine is to be singing to.After their encounter with the girys the freaks bring Gustave to the Aerie where he is greeted by the Phantom. Gustave plays a melody on the piano that leads the Phantom to suspect he is Gustave's father (\\"Beautiful\\"). The Phantom questions Gustave and finds they are kindred spirits. they sing about music in (\\"The Beauty Underneath\\") he unmasks himself, believing Gustave will accept him but Gustave is horrified and screams. Christine comforts Gustave and, when pressed by the Phantom, confesses that Gustave is his son (\\"The Phantom Confronts Christine\\"). Act two opens up to a dingy bar, Raoul contemplates his relationship with Christine first agreed by meg who tells him he is in \\"Suicide Hall\\", the place \\"where people end up when they don't know where else to go.\\" Meg swims each day to wash away the stress of working.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|A compelling story of how a innocent little girls' life can have such tragic events. A mind openning insight of how slavery affects all lives. How slaves even had a class system within their own culture. A wonderful story of how an inner strength got this little girl through a life she was not born into.Read it and you will have a better understanding of love, faith, strenth and courage.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I wasn't sure they needed to improve on the version starring Kate Beckinsale but love everything Austen so I watched it.  Loved many of the actors especially thought Michael Gambon perfected the role of Mr. Woodhouse.  I liked the fact that there was more content in this version but felt it dragged on.  Romola Garai made a firey Emma and there were more sparks between her and Mr. Knightly so I liked that and would like to see more movies that she's been in.  I always love Jonny Lee Miller, too. I'll have to see it a few more times before I'm totally in love with it.<br /><br />February 2013, I'm upgrading my opinion of this version; I love it equally as much as the other version.  I think both stand on their own as terrific adaptations.
0670021652|4.0|Gilbert's voice is continually lovely, informative and sometimes laugh out loud funny.    This book really helps to illuminate the de-valuazation that can happen to the SELF in marriages and when caring for children (which in our history both have fallen typically on women).    The historical facts, which some non-sensical findings are only from years ago, are sometimes down right shocking.    Loved it. Love her. Love myself.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|I saw them on Conan's show and fell in love right away. I You tubed it, but their album wasn't out yet. My kids adore her singing too!
B0002XMF5I|4.0|I will never forget this album.  I was a child of the 60's and 70's.  I was a metal head. I loved Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Dio, Deep Purple et al.  When I read about this collaboration in the Hit Parader magazine I was floored.  (prior to internet and cell phones Hit Parader was where I got all my metal news).  I will never forget rushing to the record store and putting down my money for this album.  I got home and ripped it open and played it loud on my dad's old 4 speaker quadrophonic stereo in our basement bar/pool room.  What a disappointing day that was.  I could not believe how BAD the production was.  The production was so bad I couldn't get past it to enjoy the music.  Eventually I ran it through my TEAC equalizer and re-mixed it enough to record to a Metal Cassette TDK and play it in my car (1974 Chevrolet Laguna SS).  It was then that I began to enjoy it a little.  Flash forward to 2009.  I listened to the samples again on itunes and downloaded the remastered mp3's.  Now I love this album  Born Again is a classic song right up there with anything Sabbath or Purple ever did.  I also love Trashed, Zero The Hero & Digital Bit*h.  The rest is quality playing and writing.  Gillian hit some incredible high notes and Tony shredded his guitar on this one.  I will always believe that if this album had a better cover and production it would have taken off and we might have gotten even more great music from them.  Then again what do I know, I also liked Seventh Star with Glenn Hughes.  Can it be 1983 again for just one day?
0618918248|2.0|I have purchased quite a few of Dawkins books, and actually share his convictions and understand where he comes from in his anti-creationist attitude.  That however does not excuse this effort.  I felt the book was cobbled together, and did not flow particularly well.  He recycled arguments continuously, and even used arguments from other authors (many generations before his time) that were put nowhere near as succinctly as in their original form.  Apologies Richard, but this book diminished your brand rather significantly.
0312370849|4.0|This book has two alternating stories for most of its length: Sarah, a young girl in 1942 Paris who is part of a roundup of Jews and the story of Julia Jarmond in the present day who has been assigned to research the roundup for its 60th anniversary. Julia lives in Paris with her husband and daughter and is shocked and saddened as she finds out more about the tragic events and the complicity of the French. She finds that her husband's family actually lived in an apartment that was vacated by Jews who were taken by the French police. This is Sarah's family. The key mentioned in the title is the key to a secret cupboard where Sarah locked her brother up to keep him safe, expecting to be home in a few hours. The story depicts the horrors of their confinement in the Vel d' Hiv and what occurs afterwards.  I was disappointed that we could not see more of Sarah's story, but understand some of the challenges that would have presented. It was an involving story and I became educated on some history that I had not known.  I appreciated that the author could have had several trite scenes, but she avoided them successfully.  This was excellent book that was well worth reading.
0061922315|4.0|In 1984 in indigent Dahanu, India Kavita gives birth to her second daughter.  She grieves what will happen to her child as poverty forced her husband Jasu to arrange the death of their first female baby.  This time, however, Kavita names her infant Asha and gets her into a Mumbai orphanage so that she might have a chance.<br /><br />In San Francisco, Indian expatriate Krishnan persuades his wife Somer, who cannot have children, to adopt a child from his homeland.  They go to Bombay where they adopt Asha although Somer fears their daughter will only bond with her father because they are both Indian while she is American.  Meanwhile Kavita grieves for her two daughters, but finally gives birth to a son.  Years later while at college in California Asha obtains a journalism fellowship that enables her to visits Mumbai.<br /><br />Interestingly the opening sequence that focuses on cultural gender issues in an abject impoverished environment are slow and lack the intensity one would expect with such a dynamic social concern.  However, once Asha returns to India, the story line goes extremely deep into gender questions that haunt modern India as well as identity concerns that trouble the heroine who wonders whether she is Indian, American or Asian-American.  Readers will appreciate this profound look at the value of girls when poverty rules.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
1591843162|5.0|This book rocks with a simple message: Ship, and ship often.    OK, it's not that simple, so Seth gives reasons, examples, and straightforward inspiration.    Bottom line is that the world is changing and the ways we're used to doing things simply won't work for much longer; in many cases the change has already happened, and certain jobs have vanished and will never come back. However Seth offers hope in quality, passion, generosity and art. It's an aspect of this book that I love, that it's about art, be it painting, accounting, music or engineering.    Well, art, and the lizard brain. heh    Read his blog to get a feel for his short punchy style, and if that works for you, then this book may help you transition from being a mere cog, to being an indispensable linchpin.
0786856297|1.0|I was somewhat captured - at first. I wanted to know more. But I could not (albeit I tried) get over the LACK OF:  1. originality, 2. good organization, 3. fluidity, and to top it all off - BAD sentence structure and repetitious style. I am left to wonder why the publishing company accepted this material.
B000O14VAU|4.0|\\"Underworld\\" is one of those movies that I can watch just about any time. While some horror purists may take exception to the folklore surrounding the vampires and werewolves portrayed in the move, I think the minor changes are logical and work well, with the exception that the vampires are a lot weaker than they should be.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the centuries long struggle between vampires and werewolves. On the surface, the vampires appear to have the upper hand with squads of \\"Death Dealers\\" (including Kate Beckinsale)  hunting down the werewolves. The twist comes when the werewolves appear to become interested in human target, for purposes other than eating him.<br /><br />The movie has a great dark atmosphere that gives a gothic feel even though it is set in the current time (except for the flashbacks). The cinematography is very good and the special effects are generally well done and certainly not over used. The acting is fairly good and Kate Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie! Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0385523904|5.0|Ms. Demick has taken a few narratives of everyday life in North Korea and weaved them together very ably, in the meantime giving some very memorable insights into everyday life in the Hermit Kingdom.  You could read elsewhere if you just wanted facts and figures about NK, but the book's narrative style is more enjoyable, and might make it easier to remember those facts/figures later on.
1590302273|5.0|This book is one of those experiences that has the capability of changing your life if you read it with an open mind and heart.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I can't count the number of times I've watched this already and it still makes me laugh. Definitely worth the money.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|The single disc DVD release is very disappointing. Almost NO special features.  Boo!  Rent it, don't buy it if you're into special features on DVDs.    Caution: Might Be A Spoiler Review.    Movie Cons:   1) If you don't like really violent scenes, I'd suggest fast-forwarding through them.  They're a bit much, in my opinion.  I get that it's a Q.T. film but it's always just above and beyond gross.  2) If you go cross-eyes reading subtitles, this may be really challenging.    3) If you have issues with violence towards women, this may bother you.  4) Man, does it twist with WW2 history. Big time.  And it is so off with the time-line of early June 1944.    5) A major plot development is never fully explained.  How DOES she end up with that movie theater anyway?    Pros:   1)Those caveats aside, this is a really well done film, beautifully shot.  Lighting and scenes, set dressing, costumes etc. are really outstanding.  I believe they may have made one mistake with the British officer's uniform but that's a small detail.  I liked the pacing of the film especially.  It really is a character study with adventure and gore thrown in.    2) Christoph Waltz as Col. Landa is simply amazing!!  He is so charmingly creepy that I felt like I was being ensnared, undressed and hung out to dry in a slime pit.  The first scene is so taut that I had to stop the DVD and breath a bit.  You know it's NOT going to end nicely but still, I was riveted.  It wasn't over-paced either. Perfect.  Funny thing is, I felt watching Mr. Waltz' performance that he probably is a great guy in \\"real\\" life.  I'd put him down as one of the great film villains!    3) Brad Pitt is handsome and wise-cracking with an accent you could cut concrete with.  I'm not a fan of his but he was great!    4) The two lead females are talented and gorgeous.  If you wonder why Diane Kruger looks familiar, she was in the National Treasure movies. And she must speak a bunch of languages because her accents (to me) were excellent!    5) If you're multi-lingual and want to brush up on your French, German and Italian, it's great practice!    6) The casting is brilliant, well-done!    I would recommend this movie highly, but if you're squeamish at all, fast forward when the knives, guns and baseball bats come out.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|To say that lead actor Tom Hardy is gonzo-brilliant is nearly as understating as the complete overlooking of his performance throughout award season. Director Refn's approach here is as viscerally punctuated and artistically daring as anything in his excellent \\"Pusher Trilogy.\\"
0321525655|5.0|Presentation Zen<br /><br />I purchased this book looking for ways to improve my presentations, and I was not disappointed. Garr covered a lot of topics that have truly helped me out. I've used Powerpoint for a number of years and grew weary of creating the same old boring slides. Garr's book was a welcome addition to my library and has formed a new foundation for making my slides. The Zen approach seems odd at first, and I was very skeptical of his approach. It seemed like he was trying to teach me Japanese at first, and covered a lot of Zen philosophies. Then it clicked - I realized his goal was to show how slides can be even more effective by doing more with less. A lot of the tips given (thinking with the beginner's mind, rule of two thirds, full bleed images) are logical and make a lot of sense. I learned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to students and professionals.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to read, simple and logical approach to each topic<br /><br />Cons: None, I was skeptical at first but I did a 180 at the end of the book<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I fully intend on doing the Deluxe wonderfullness of the Amazon version of this CD but I could not help but notice something mission from both versions. Where is \\"Paint the Sky with Stars?\\" I cannot imagine that song would not have been added to this collection but there it is... In Heaven's name, why?!?!?!
1427200246|5.0|Kotter's parable on change and the human reaction to it creates a real-life proverb with which everyone can identify. It is relevant to the business environment and can easily be applied to one's personal life. His characterizations of the spenguin-people make it enjoyable and fun reading. Whether you are managing a company, or a busines team, teaching high school students, run a 'mom or pop' shop in the local community, or want to achieve smoother realtionships within families to better map out a plan to 'oil its efficiency' - this is the book; a must-have resource.
B000026OW3|5.0|The chair of our music department in college had studied with Rubinstein at one point in time.  Rubinstein is thought by many to be the greatest performer of Chopin's music.  A large collection which I've used to inspire my own playing.  Organized conveniently with All Mazurka's on one CD, Ballades on one CD, etc.

B001HN69B8|4.0|The Amazon reviewer Kathleen Fennessy onces again makes errors in the details of her review. I'm not trying to launch a personal attack against her, but it seems to be a reoccurring theme in her otherwise decent reviews. The deal is not that Parnassus gives the Devil 5 souls by his daughter's 16 birthday, it's instead a competition between to the two to be the first to reach an allotted amount of souls before her birthday.<br /><br />  On to the film, if you enjoy Gilliam, then you're likely to enjoy this Faustian Fable. It is phantasmorphical nearly to levels of cartoonery, and it's all quite weird, but it's also uniquely rendered and wildly imaginative. The main fault I found with it was it's meandering narrative progression in the first half, and it's somewhat anticlimactic denouement in the 2nd. Still, I enjoyed it, and felt it begged for a 2nd viewing and think that 1080p will serve it very well.
B00004S35Z|4.0|Not one of Stevie's greatest during his so-called classic years, but definitely one with tracks that can stand the test of time.  We were spoiled by the greatness of Songs in the Key of Life and Innervisions, but this is not one to scoff at.  Satisfying ... as Stevie, once again, takes us through another musical journey with his personal feelings and commentaries on religion, politics, love and some other things that may fall in-between.  He doesn't always have to reach levels as high as SITKOL or Innervisions, but I'm still glad that he made this album.
0061914177|5.0|This book is awesome!  If you want to find your life passion, quite your job that sucks, and love what you do then read this book.  Gary goes through what it takes to Crush it in your own business and how to make the transition from working for the man to working for yourself.  So many people spend the majority of their lives doing something all day long that they don't love doing.  This reminds me of a famous quote:<br /><br />The richest place in the world is a graveyard, it's where are lost hopes, dreams, and unused gifts are buried.  Read this book and start living your dreams now!
B000IFQLLY|4.0|The CD was in excellent codition, too bad the music on it was mostly sort of blase.
B002VWONB2|4.0|The classic movie in high def.  Sound remains MONO; I guess it would be nice if someone would spend time in the studio and create stereo or surround from the audio track.  I guess most film purists would prefer to watch the film in its original audio.  It would be nice to have multiple audio track options.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Okay every says this is a bad book. I have to say that it does feel a little rushed. I got confused with all he things that happen. I think that its great its my favorite Twilight book. It has a difret way of Twilight but i like it. It was great. I feel sad that Benjamin the vampire who controls water, air, earth and fire. He doesn't get much to do i wish he did. The story could have been done better but if you like Twilight or a romance book. This is the book. I love the start how Bella and Edward go on to the island on there honeymoon. Get this book.

B001HN694K|2.0|Wonderland weirdness is utterly normal for Tim Burton and collaborator Johnny Depp who of course about everybody felt were perfect to do a new film version.<br /><br />My immediate reaction after just seeing this is been-there-done-that, but I vaguely recall it being a way cooler trip. Why is that?<br /><br />The highlight for me was Johnny Depp yet again perfectly transformed and fully immersed in another character, except for the ultra-goofy \\"dance\\" which was maybe the worst, most cringe inducing thing in the whole movie. But what an actor! He even came up with the look of his Mad Hatter. Perfect.<br /><br />The biggest failure of this film -I'd agree with Roger Ebert- is the big, dumb, loud and boring unnecessary third act battle.<br /><br />But I found this movie in general just really *odd*. It's a story about an upper class English girl from stuffy aristocratic society, this time in her late teens, hanging out with a bunch of weirdos, as director Tim Burton put it. Well Burton said \\"brat\\" hanging with a bunch of weirdos is basically the depth to which the story has been brought to the screen before, but here Alice seems like a pretty cool, independently minded chick ahead of her time. In fact the Burton version is basically a \\"you-go-girl\\" fable about following your bliss (literally following your dreams in this case) and having the courage to be yourself...<br /><br />It felt familiar but wasn't what I expected at the same time and the story didn't truly hold my interest and exactly why I can't put my finger on. Combination of things. Burton's attempt to add a tad more depth to these dream creatures and this being Alice's second trip down the rabbit hole? The pacing of events and subplots? I don't recall the Disney cartoon so much or the original Lewis Carrol story at all but there were details in this version that were weird. Members of The Red Queen's court and the intrigues, the Knave of Hearts, just the look of some of these characters and the castle were creepy, but not in a good way to me. This movie will give many kids some weird dreams by the way.<br />The special effects were OK but for a person not too big on cgi I was again underwhelmed. Props on The Cheshire Cat tho... I dug that. To be sure there were some moments. I went in with an open mind towards the cgi and the 3-D and I gotta say I think 3-D is overall just lame. It strikes me as mostly a gimmick and the visuals will look more vibrant and colorful in good ole 2-dimension in your home on Blue Ray. (Although I want to add as a side note the preview for a 3-D documentary of the mission to repair to Hubble Telescope was incredible!!)<br /><br />Sorry don't want to harsh anybody's high.<br />2.8 starsThis movie will give many kids some weird dreams by the way.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|I got this because my fiance works second shift and always misses the good shows. We both love this show. The characters are great.It is show well. I'm not the biggest fan of sci-fi but this is very entertaining and quite funny at times.
0691142165|4.0|This book documents better than any prior book the history of banking and government debt crises. Most of it is unsurprising to those familiar with the subject. It has more comprehensive data than I've seen before.<br /><br />It is easier reading than the length would suggest (it has many tables of data, and few readers will be tempted to read all the data). It is relatively objective. That makes it less exciting than the more ideological writings on the subject.<br /><br />The comparisons between well governed and poorly governed countries show that governments can become mature enough that defaults on government debt and hyperinflation are rare or eliminated, but there is little different in banking crises between different types of government / economies.<br /><br />They claim that international capital mobility has produced banking crises, but don't convince me that they understand the causality behind the correlation. I'd guess that one causal factor is that the optimism that produces bubbles causes more investors to move money into countries they understand less well than their home country, which means their money is more likely to end up in reckless institutions.<br /><br />The book ends with tentative guesses about which countries are about to become mature enough to avoid sovereign debt crises. Among the seven candidates is Greece, which is now looking like a poor guess less than a half year after it was published.
0307454541|4.0|This book was chosen for a book club choice so that is why I started reading it. We realized it was part of a trilogy but were only going to read the first book. It took me a bit to get into the book but once I got past about 40 pages I was hooked. We have now decided to read the second book for another month's book club choice. I would recommend this book highly!

0571240151|5.0|Think of it this way, your best friend is sent away to fight in World War I and there is no way of contacting him and you may never be able to see him again.  In Michael Morpurgo's novel, War Horse, the author weaves a tale of friendship between a young horse and boy during the first World War.  The friendship is interrupted when the boy's  father, drunk yet again, sells the horse, Joey, to the army where he is trained to be a `war horse'.   Joey and the companions that he meets during the war illustrate how acts of kindness and caring can help you survive the hardship of war.   Michael Morpurgo has written the story from Joey's point of view, which has given the novel strength because you hear what everyone thinks of the war including both sides as well as civilians.  As Joey's experiences take him from the English side of the war to the German side, you meet the individuals from both sides and realize that none of them want to be in the war.  This is illustrated by a German soldier, who everyone thinks is crazy, he tells Joey, and the other horse he cares for,  \\"I tell you that I am the only sane man in the regiment.  It's the others who   are crazy, but they don't know it.  They fight a war and they don't know what for.    Isn't that crazy?  How can one man kill another and not really know the reason   why he does it, except that the other man wears a different color uniform and   speaks another language?  And its me they call crazy!  You two are the  only   rational creatures I've met in this stupid war, and like me, the only reason you're   here is because you were brought here.  If I had the courage -- and I haven't --   we'd take off down this road and never come back.\\"    Another important theme that is shown in the story is that friendship and individuals matter.  Joey meets people from all different places, to him they are all individuals.  In a scene where an  English soldier and German soldier meet in `No Man's Land` they discuss how if war were decidedby individuals rather than countries maybe it wouldn't drag on so long.       \\"In an hour, maybe, or two... we will be trying our best again each other to kill.    God only knows why we do it, and I think He has maybe forgotten why.      Good-bye, Welshman.  We have shown them, haven't we?  We have shown them   that any problem can be solved between people if only we can trust each other.    That is all it needs, no?\\"    It is the little acts of kindness that help Joey and his friends survive the war.   This unusual story will stay with the reader long after they have turned the last page.  In the author's note Michael Morpurgo writes:  Some in the village, only a very few now and fewer as each year goes by, remember Joey as he was.  His story is written so that neither he nor those who knew him, nor the war they lived and died in, will be forgotten.  And with that I would like to say that with this novel he truly made Joey's as well as the other individuals portrayed in the books story live on.  The people from the village won't be the last ones to cherish this story but are only the beginning of many who will come to know and love this story.

Love the title track of this CD, and the words to the other songs are awesome.  Music is soft and easy.  Wish there was some more up tempo stuff.  For me it is not a CD to sit and listen thru completely, you definetly have to have this one on shuffle with some other stuff.... so, needless to say a bit disappointed, but maybe my hopes were just thru the roof.

Now that the book has been published I am very satisfied with the way it was structured and I truly believe it will become a best seller. The canvas method has been proved to be very intuitive to use, I have used it myself to discuss new business models with my 11 and 6 year old daughters and I can tell you not only they understood the method and provide insightful ideas, but we had a good time designing the new business model.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw this movie a few months ago.  I've seen slaughterhouses before and I'm not bothered by that sort of thing because I know where my food comes from.  What I didn't know is how harmful the food industry practices are to the animal.  And no, I'm not referring to inhumane treatment.  I mean the unsanitary conditions, unhealthy diets, growth hormones, antiobiotics, etc.  It will truly make you question the food that you put on your plate.    Just to be clear, this isn't a treehugger, save the animals movie.  It reports on the unsafe practices in our food system and helps to open your eyes to finding healthier sources (i.e. grass-fed beef instead of corn-fed beef, free-range chickens, etc.)    If you care about what you put in your body, then this film is a must see.
0805091742|3.0|Atul Gawande has written another thoughtful book, this one titled, The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right. In it, Gawande highlights a simple method to provide protection against failure: a checklist. Even the most expert professionals can benefit from help in the form of a structured approach to ensure that communication and engagement occurs among team members working together to achieve results. He examines the way pilots and builders use detailed checklists, and describes how the use of a surgery checklist led to improved results. His writing style allows readers to remain fully engaged, and any expert upon finishing the book, will be hard pressed to conclude that those involved in complex work can get by without a tool like a checklist. Resistance is futile: try a checklist as protection against unintended ineptitude.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B00318COS4|5.0|To paraphrase Cornelius Celsus, Machinarium is the Art of Educated Guessing. Yes, art.<br /><br />This indie gem is a definite affirmation to the question whether PC gaming is an art-form. In recent years the genre has strayed towards the-latest-hardware-demanding yet vapid eye-candy. So when a slow and moody game comes along, on that can run in almost any machine and offers subtle fun, we tend to underestimate it.<br /><br />This is a logic puzzle-adventure. Sometimes the puzzles are easy. Sometimes you get lucky (hence the \\"Educated Guessing\\" in the title). And sometime you get stuck and you shall need hints or even the level walkthrough contained in a locked book that opens with a mini-game. However, perseverance is rewarded with the satisfaction of being able to untangle the inner logic of the game.<br />I have been playing puzzle adventures ever since [[ASIN:B0000AFWWH Myst]] and, although I am not an exclusive fan of the genre, over the years I have played its best representatives. And MACHINARIUM should be considered one of them.<br /><br />The game is also a avant-garde cartoon story, with beautifully hand-drawn backgrounds and an endearing protagonist.<br /><br />The game may not last long but I promise you it will stay for you for a very long time.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

A great role model for network marketing professionals.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I like this product, other than the fact that the remote is kinda useless.  I wish that you would be able to use the remote to turn on the mobile anytime you want, but it only stays active for like 10 minutes tops and then you have to hit one of the buttons on the actual mobile for it to be able to be shut off or on with the remote.  But, the baby really likes it and she usually falls alseep within the playing time of the song and it's not much needed.  I haven't used the remote at all.
0375842209|5.0|I first heard about this book when Markus Zusak was talking about it on the radio, and I thought it sounded interesting. The first thing that hooked me was the writing style and perspective - how often do you read books narrated by Death? It's hard not to be intrigued. Though this book is long (it's definitely not an action-filled suspense novel), it's well worth the read. It took me quite a while to finish, but when I finally reached the end, I could not help but cry my eyes out. This book truly changed what I knew about World War II and how I've looked at books since. The Book Thief proves that books really can change your life.

0307269981|5.0|What more can I say but that she is the most fascinating character I've ever come across in crime fiction.  She is a 97 pound weakling who beats up motorcyclists, the institutionalized girl, barely educated who studies Fermat's last theorem in her spare time.  And Stieg Larsson's writing makes her come alive on the page.  If you finish this book and agree with me don't wait for the sequel to be issued in the US since it follows right on the heels of this book.  Stieg Larsson was a good man who Sweeden will miss and a great writer who I will miss.  I wish there were 10 or 20 more novels of Lisbeth's adventures to follow.
B000002IJL|4.0|I took a close look at the movie end credits to see what songs had been left off the \\"official original soundtrack\\" music CD. After trawling the Internet and a local Indie/used CD store, I came up with the following:    1)Red River Rock (Johnny & The Hurricanes, 1959)-Stands in for the orchestral version of \\"Stand By Me\\" as the newspaper headline \\"Local Attorney Chris Chambers Killed\\" appears.  2)Rockin' Robin (Bobby Day, 1958)  3)Sorry (I Ran All The Way Home) (The Impalas, 1959)  4)Mr. Lee  5)Rebel Rouser (Duane Eddy, 1958)-Stands in for \\"The Ballad of Paladin\\"  6)Great Balls of Fire  7)Whispering Bells  8)Let The Good Times Roll  9)Book of Love (The Monotones, 1957)  10)Lollipop  11)Everyday  12)Come Go With Me  13)Come Softly To Me (The Fleetwoods. 1959)  14)Hushabye (The Mystics. 1959)  15)Get A Job  16)Yakety Yak  17)Stand By Me    40 minutes, 40 seconds    In 1959, I was a tad younger than the characters in the movie, but I lived in a small town and roamed freely to places forbidden and dangerous as they did. My older sister was the 45RPM single collector. but the Doo Wop music of the era remains stuck in memory. I wouldn't mind visiting the town of the 1950's as an adult, but until/unless that becomes possible, this soundtrack takes me down the hill to our little town.
B000000W5L|5.0|This album is a masterpiece!  The amazing thing is that Mick and Keith knew what they had when they recorded Exile - the first and lst song on every one of the four sides is simply perfect!  Rocks Off, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Let it Loose, Happy, All Down the Line, and Soul Survivor are Masterpieces, and the second song on each side are also outstanding:  Rip This Joint, Torn and Frayed, Turd on the Run, and Stop Breaking Down.  This is an album that deserves a single listen - from start to finish - as it is much like a book.  A side note - they are the only band in history to do remakes better than the original artists - think about it!

B0011UBDTK|1.0|I chose the option to 'buy new' instead of used, as I was spending so much I wanted the extra peace of mind it would work. I also chose the regular shipping method... A month and a half later I finally got my movies. The set was shrink rapped in unmarked plastic, which at the time I did not notice. However, as I got more of the coverings off I realized everything had tiny scratches and marks... like the kind all movies get after being watched a few times. I decided to over-look the problem as the scratches were not too bad. However, when I went to watch the movies, it became very apparent the scratches were too bad to be able to watch the movies smoothly. There were skips and other problems with the disks... Now I have to go through filing a claim to try to get my money back... ALL I WANTED WAS SOME ENTERTAINMENT FOR MY SPRING BREAK! Don't buy from dvdguy. He is a scam!
6300183513|4.0|Actually, \\"Rear Window\\" is a great film- suspense, Jimmy Stewart, and Raymond Burr as the brow beaten heavy you love to hate.  The VHS version is fine with me.  You can read the summary on Wikipedia.  What creeped me out was the love interest between the aged old Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. (I did not need to see Jimmy with his shirt off either.)  The makeout scenes could have been deleted, for all I care, or an older attractive actress could have been more demure.  Oh, well...  I mean...it was like some sweet young thing doing you know what with her grandfather. But, the VHS still stacks up well against most new releases.  Watch for Alfred in the songwriter's apartment.

0385736002|5.0|This book was a total delight.  Reading The Alchemyst was similar to watching the very first Indiana Jones movie...sort of sheer delight and awe and excitement.  Josh and Sophie...quite ordinary twins...are suddenly thrust into an unknown world.  This book had just about everything in it that could be imagined into a fantasy of this nature.  It was sort of classic good against evil although sometimes I was a bit unsure of who was good and who was evil and often my ideas about that changed.  It was a wonderful book to read. It was  chasing and trying to be safe and then not being safe and always constant running running running. I hated when it ended but was delighted to pick up the second and third book in this series as I anxiously wait for the fourth.  When I put the third book down after I finished it...I immediately raced to Michael Scott's website to find out how much longer I would have to wait to be in this adventure again.  Trust me...I have already waited far too long.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385737289 The Magician (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel)]]
B0000017CA|5.0|This album is just incredible and if you are into sludgey(still heavy as hell) metal you will covet this one.  With tunes like Jezebel, Blue, Tranquilized, Dope Fiend and really the rest of em...seems totally impressive.<br /><br />Updated 5/10/10 - wow this album just doesn't cease to amaze.  Much more depth here than originally thought.  Really a great record all the way through with surprising lyrical excellence as well.  The vocals are some of the best I've heard on many a metal album.<br /><br />Updated 7/18/2012 - Seriously after all these years this is probably one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It just doesn't get old like MOST other albums.  Probably one of the best metal recordings ever.
B001HN694K|5.0|Alice in Wonderland meets The Lord of the Rings! Alice meets Frodo Baggins! Madness meets magic! Tim Burton has lost none of his muchness. If only the Blue Caterpillar had given up his habit.<br /><br />Delightfully madcap performances by Johnny Depp and by Helena Bonham Carter lived up to their advance billing. Anne Hathaway was ditzily gorgeous as the White Queen. The acting of established pros, however, only framed the charming strength of newcomer Mia Wasikowska. Wisftul and willful, soft-spoken and fierce, she was captivating as the child-woman of Burton's revisionist tale. No Oscars for special-effects films, as Avatar taught us, but Mia's day will come.<br /><br />I watched the movie in 3D, but it would not lose as much on flatscreen as Avatar would. Alice's sets, alternately whimsical and nightmarish, would be wonderful in any dimension. As for Danny Elfman's majestic score, reminescent of Howard Shore's in LOTR, it deserves to be heard on its own.<br /><br />Burton's Alice is not the one that Lewis Carroll wrote, but perhaps he would have wished that he had written it.

B002E9HACG|5.0|When I was at high school and college if you liked Europe you were either a girl or batted for the other team. I'm talking about when Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest and AC/DC ruled.  Everyone had to have a denim jacket adorned with patches of these bands, and although showing yourself as a fan of these tough bands also showed everyone how tough you were (so you thought), you were allowed to be a fan of bands like Motley Crue, Van Halen, Aerosmith and Def Leppard a little bit too.  That's because although these bands weren't so tough, they were cool and cool was ok.  But unfortunately for Europe they were neither tough nor cool, and were always considered as posers, never the real deal.  Let's face it, how can a band who released that woeful 80's synthesizer/keyboard tripe \\"The Final Countdown\\" ever have any credibility, let alone have balls and be cool?<br /><br />Thus, once the countdown had finally ended, so too had Europe, never to be heard of again, just a sour stinking blip in metal history.  Or so I thought until a friend played me their 2009 album \\"Last Look At Eden\\".  How dare he?  But, curious to hear if they still had that same lame sound I gave it a bit of a listen.  So I was somewhat surprised when the title track sounded a little bit... cool dare I say it?  No, it couldn't be.  I skipped to the next song - no powering riffs or Halford-esque screams here, same for the next track, then the next, then the next etc.  So there I had it.  No synthesizer/keyboard dominated candy floss tunes, but no ball tearing tough nuts either, and nothing that truly grabbed me so I quickly dismissed it.<br /><br />But my mate wouldn't let up.  He kept telling me how good this album was so I gave it some more spins.  And guess what?  Now I like it.  A lot!  No big hooks, screaming vocals or power riffs, but I still like it.  Why?  It's cool.  Yes that's right, I never thought I'd see the day but here it is.  Europe are cool.  What this album does have is great melody, more toughness and a harder edge than I've ever heard from Europe, lots of groove, and a real bluesy swagger.  Being a fan of blues music I really dig this retro bluesy rock stuff which Europe have somehow managed to sound fresh at the same time, and thus we have a great bunch of songs on what I believe is one of the most consistent albums of the year.  In fact it's not until tracks 10 and 11 \\"U Devil U\\" and \\"Run With The Angels\\" that we get a couple of songs that might (I stress might) be considered fillers.  Not too bad themselves, but I don't think they are as good as the rest of the album.<br /><br />As for the rest of the songs we get plenty of bluesy swagger on \\"Gonna Get Ready\\", \\"Catch That Plane\\", \\"Mojito Girl\\", \\"You Only Live Twice\\" and the album closer \\"In My Time\\"  is just a cool, pure blues rock ballad much in the vein of Dave Meniketti's (Y&T) solo blues album and I love it.  Many have tried this type of song but here Europe convincingly conveys the feel and emotion of the blues.  Then there's more hard rocking \\"The Beast\\" , \\"No Stone Unturned\\" (here we get some prominent synthesizer in the middle of the song but it actually fits quite well and isn't overpowering), and the title track with it's movie theme-esque sound.  Three more great songs and then when you include the power ballad \\"New Love In Town\\" which is every bit as good as anything Bon Jovi has ever done, it's actually very difficult to pick out album high lights.<br /><br />Production is good, John Norum's guitar work is not flashy at all, but he rocks out some very well done, quality stuff here and Joey Tempest has a real smooth, cool sounding voice these days.  Thankfully there are none of the higher girly vocals a-la \\"The Final Countdown\\".  So whilst I was very reluctant to even consider that this album could ever have sounded good at all, it has proved to be a real grower on me.  So much so that it's now the first and only album from Europe that I've ever bought!  Try as I may have, I just could not dismiss it as worthless rubbish.  Indeed it is far from it, and I've actually found I play it more than any other release I got from 2009.  (What is it with this cover though???)it as worthless rubbish.  Indeed it is far from it, and I've actually found I play it more than any other release I got from 2009.  (What is it with this cover though???)
1608201236|5.0|The following is mostly for the benefit of those who have not read Josh Lanyon's Adrien English Mysteries, or any other of Lanyon's stories. But if you have been following the Adrien English series, and haven't yet read Dark Tide, you are seriously messing up. What are you waiting for? Buy the book. Holy Moly.     Adrien English has heart trouble. Physically, he's trying to recover from open heart surgery, and emotionally from a devastating break-up two years before with hot, handsome and conflicted Jake Riordan. Not only that, the fifty-year old skeleton of an apparent murder victim is discovered in the building housing his bookstore. A burglar keeps breaking into the place, and two of Adrien's old boyfiends show up right when Jake Riordan wants back in his life.     Will Adrien get over his heart trouble and overcome his fear of getting back together with Jake? Or will he go back to one of his other ex-boyfriends? Wiill Jake give up and move away? And will both Jake and Adrien survive the unexpected threats that surface as they attempt to unravel the mystery of the skeleton?    Lanyon weaves these two strands of suspense together and stretches them almost to the breaking point. And he keeps you totally engaged until he finally releases the tension in the last pages of the book.  The wait is worth it.     The story is driven by the subtle and credible pyschological characterization of the two main characters. Lanyon makes wonderful use of cultural references to indicate moods and motivations. For example, early on, after he's just talked to Jake, Adrien is listening to Cole Porter's \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye.\\" If you happen to know the very next four words of the song (and Lanyon doesn't reveal them), you'll have a beautiful insight into Adrien's feelings and subsequent behavior.    The dialog is razor sharp, witty, and ironic in the true Raymond Chandler noir mode.    \\"Dark Tide\\" is full of evocative echoes of other literature: Chandler, of course, perhaps Poeas  hinted above, and Renault's \\"Charioteer,\\" and more. But you don't need to have read that stuff, or even the preceding four Adrien English stories (although if you have, Adrien's quandary becomes especially poignant) to enjoy this richly written and totally entertaining novel.          ###

B0031OCY2E|4.0|I declare! Matt Damon is quite the actor. Handsome in a boy-next-door sort of way, moving from reflective actor to action figure--quite convincingly!--and return to a deceptive reflection to play the subject of this film--\\"The Informant!\\"<br /><br />At first you might not recognize Damon. That's because he gained 30 pounds, added a mustache and hairpiece to transform himself into a \\"nerdy\\" biochemist and executive officer of a high-profile agricultural firm flourishing in the '90's.<br /><br />The actor inside the character inside the character--or something like that--is so believable! Matt Damon plays this character close to the chest, revealing only throw-away cards at a time. It's a brilliant performance, but the viewer won't know it until the very end, suddenly to feel the need to hit the back button to see the film again--this time with great admiration for Damon's amazing, consummate, actorly skills. This is totally Matt Damon's show!<br /><br />When I rented this DVD, I thought I was getting Damon's new action flick and was SO disappointed that the story was about conglomerate misdoings--price fixing. Although wrapped in a film of humor, the story transcends humor to reveal its serious underbelly--those horrible things we often affix to big business: corruption, sweet deals, pocket lining, disdain for loyalty and honesty. Anything for self-promotion and the mighty buck! Again, I've just used words that, out of context, provide no context for the real subject of \\"The Informant.\\" Perhaps the title itself is a clue.<br /><br />While the action may seem a bit slow, each new revelation will jolt the viewer out of any daze to start sitting up and paying attention. This is film work at its subtle best! Kudos go to Steven Soderbergh for his choice of story and direction in showing that story. Perhaps it's not Academy Award material, but it is one of those films you must see. Although there are no careening cars, there is careening all over the place. Wow, what a ride!

It is consistently what he asks me to read him before bed (or any other time for that matter). The stories are very simply worded but profound. Lobel writes and illustrates wonderful little books that are sweet, smart and rich with meaning. I highly recommend any of them, but especially Owl at Home.

The widescreen side (yup, it's one of those silly things) gives you a floating rectangle with black all around.  You'll have to use a \\"stretch\\" feature to make it cross the screen from left to right, and then it will probably be cropped on the ends.  And then it's horribly fuzzy.  But the worst thing is that it is very contrasty, with the subtle and beautiful greyscale largely wiped out.    The 2006 2-disc release looks awesome by comparison.  If you respect the art, spend the bucks.
B00005AG7K|1.0|You get what you pay for! This has a terrible video quality. Very hard to watch!
1400052173|4.0|An interesting read that shows how medicine really is a science of trial and error and in this lady's case mostly error.  Yet, what happened because of her own particular differences may help change the medical world.
0316069906|5.0|This is an eye opening book that appears to be very well thought out and tries to be objective. The author will educate you and once you are educated it's hard to ignore that we all need to look closely at what we want to eat and what we want to feed our kids. Educate yourself for the future!
0385341008|5.0|My mother recommended this book so I decided to buy it for a trip I was taking to New Zealand with a friend.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the book because I thought its primary appeal would be to an older demographic.  I was on the vacation of a lifetime in one of the most beautiful places on earth, but I couldn't wait to get back to my book.  I would read it late at night after a full day of sight seeing  and adventuring and I am sure my traveling partner was amazed at how much time I spent laughing.  Some scenes were so funny I felt like I needed to read them out loud to share them. It was one of the few books I have read lately that I wished would not end.  It has been a couple of months now and I think it is time to read it again.
B000000P17|5.0|beside of any bad critics this album got when it was new. i personally consider it a great album , something like a different guns and roses experiencing with a different theme.
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book! I laughed and I cried(both of joy and sorrow). The story felt so real and alive, I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction. You cannot help but falling in love with all of the members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Now I want to go live in Guernsey and join a Literary Society. I can also say that I know a bit more about what happened at Guernsey during World War II, a period in time that we shouldn't allow ourselves to ever forget.

B001DDBCV4|5.0|i was very unsure of the movie coming out, since i thought the series ended so perfect. however i was pleasantly surprised. i love it! its all that you expect from the series, the girls, the city, cosmos, clothes, shoes, and men...oh and sex. i think the opening of the movie is so beautiful on blue ray. i highly recommend this for any satc fan!

B00365YVRO|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites to date. Hands down. Some critics say it's too melancholly, or too programmed. Maybe they haven't been listening to Sade for the last 25 years. I think it will get a Grammy for album of the year!

1554072840|5.0|My daughter's about 20 months and has been showing a lot of interest in the \\"potty.\\" We aren't pushing potty training, but bought her this book to start getting her comfortable with the idea, and she really enjoys the story. She picks it out off of her shelf of many books and brings it to me to read to her. I like that it talks about body parts (not the names we use, but we use our family's vocabulary when we read), having accidents, and my favorite - washing your hands after you go!
B001LPWGE6|4.0|I ordered the Bourne Trilogy on Blu Ray and it came still sealed and works fine, but it is the UK version of the films! The cover art is cooler than the American version, which is a plus, but many UK movies do not play on US blu ray players! You may want to email this guy before you buy from him and make sure you are getting the right region, and the seller shouldn't mask his foreign product behind the image of an American one!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|If you want to see some great rehearsal and concert footage of the King of Pop before his death this video is the one for you. If you are a true Michael Jackson fan this DVD really does a great job covering the King of Pop at his best during all of his rehearsals as well as some of the concert footage and some ads that he also made during his last moments before his death. All the footage that you see in this DVD is all of the King of Pop doing what he loved to do and that was sing as well as dance and do his choreography according to the way he would do it and also making sure that everything would be perfect and just the way he would want everything to go in his shows. And it was sad when he finally left us but this video really show Michael right before his death in his rehearsals before he went on tour but it was not meant to be. So if you want to see Michael Jackson in great rehearsal and concert footage before he passed on, By all means purchase this one, it is really great. and it truly shows him at his best.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Because it is imposible to review a product that has yet to be released, my five star rating is based on the five and one-half seasons I have seen. I am hoping that the ending will be worth the wait. I also hope that I can allocate enough time to watch the entire collection in a short period of time. With its late August release, my goal is to view as much of the series as I can before the NFL season gets underway. After that, I lose Sundays and Monday nights as time when I can watch. As for fears that season six won't be part of the package, I am assuming that all six seasons will be included. After all, it is called \\"complete.\\" I hope that purchasers of the blu-ray will have two viewing options: with or without the lower screen explanations that appear when an episode is re-run. If anyone knows whether that will happen, please post the answer in a comment to this reviw or in a separate review.    Watching an entire series in order can be a thrilling experience. I did that with the X-Files and look forward to doing the same with Lost. It should be even more satsifying with Lost because the creators and writers have known for a few years when the series would end and have had time to work out an ending that wraps things up (unlike Jerico that never got completed or the X-Files that seemed to limp to the finish line). As for anyone viewing the entire series over a Lost Weekend, I point out that John Lennon's so-called lost weekend lasted over a year!
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|\\"Plastic Beach\\" by Gorillaz has instantly become one of my all-time favorite albums.  It opens with a orchestral arrangement that quickly transitions into a rap welcoming you to the \\"plastic beach\\".  Immediately you realize that this album was meant to be a cohesive unit, and not just a bunch of artists putting their two cents in to produce an album.  The overall theme of the album is what you might deduce from the title:  a statement against rampant waste produced by our civilization.  Almost every track deals with this issue in its own way.  The styles vary from the rap of the second track to the crooning of 2D that we have become very used to in past Gorillaz albums, to some more soulful tracks that bridge the sound between the previous two.  The album is exceptionally well constructed, and a direct comparison can be made to the construction of Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", because both albums have a overarching goal (OK Computer's was a statement against the excessively robotic life of the modern (sub)urbanized human), they stick to it throughout, the songs are all beautiful in their own right, and both contain a bridging track in the middle (Glitter Freeze, which is mainly a techno break compared with Fitter, Happier).  Not to mention that both are produced by Brits!  Anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this album if you are looking for a fascinating, cohesive journey into a caricaturized hypothetical future produced by our wasteful ways.  It's a timely work, especially in this age of global warming skepticism.  There aren't as many single-type tracks as there were on the previous two LPs, but the songs are certainly beautiful and danceable, although the subject matter is perhaps too depressing to make you jump around your room with friends.
B002VECM4A|5.0|I meant to write a review of \\"Precious\\" even before I watched it. Lots of times, writing the review is more satisfying than watching the film. This is harder. I felt my heart constrict in the first scene of Precious. My eyes and temple began to throb. I could scarcely catch my breath the rest of the way through the film. \\"Life\\" requires too much of us sometimes. Sometimes even a simulation of Life requires too much.<br /><br />Improbable as it may seem, coming from a retired classical musician like me, who has lived fairly well most of his life, a lot of the misery portrayed in Precious is horribly familiar and real. The poverty and brutishness and the haplessness of both takers and givers of \\"welfare\\" are not exaggerated here. Yeah, things seldom move that quickly or that much in 'real time', and yeah, Precious's classmates evolve from intolerable to empathetic as if by miracle. But the story line isn't very central to this film, or rather to my response to this film, which is all Sorrow for all of us, from Precious to Queen Elizabeth II. Life hurts too much. The rosy glow of Hope in \\"Precious\\", which some critics have applauded and some derided, is more light than warmth. There really isn't much chance for that girl-woman in the film, except for the one-in-sixty-million chance that she'll be discovered by a film maker.<br /><br />\\"Precious\\" had a hundred times the impact on me that \\"The Hurt Locker\\" had. But I can't sit in judgment on the \\"art\\" of it as cinema. For sure, I won't forget it as quickly as I do most films.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is like nothing you have ever seen before. See what millions of other viewers are talking about and buy this movie if you missed your chance at the theaters. You will want to watch it again and again!
B0009MAO46|3.0|My son was so excited to get this movie. He waited by the mailbox everyday to see if it had arrived, and when it did we watched it right away. It is scratched through almost the whole movie. We can still watch it, but we just have to sit there and watch it jump scenes on its own and hes very upset about it.  Definitely not worth the money. I will never purchase a used DVD off Amazon again.
B0036EH3WK|1.0|How is this a complete collection without season 6?  What's the point of getting this box set if you're just going to have to purchase the last season separately - which releases on blu-ray around the same time??    This is such a deal breaker for me.  I was going to pre-order, but thank God I read the description to see what seasons were included (the Amazon \\"Customers who purchased this also purchased Lost: The Final Season\\" thing threw me off and concerned me).    I realize companies want to double-dip, and I can accept that, but dont' advertise a \\"Complete Collection\\" without it actually being complete.  That is blatant false advertisement and I'm honestly considering reporting this product to the BBB.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|Starts out good but gets a little too much for me to listen to after like 7 songs. Its good though.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|This is my very first review that I've ever felt compelled to write. If you love the Sookie Stackhouse series of books like I do, you probly will be disappointed in the Trueblood series for HBO on DVD. It's a bunch of B-movie actors putting on bad porno with a vampire theme. Whoever wrote this tv series must have not read the books, because the tv version DOES NOT stay true to the books that Charlaine Harris has written. Why on earth would the writers of the Trueblood series ever change anything when the books truly stand on their own. The producers of the Trueblood series would have had a real winner on their hands if they would have left it alone and kept it like Charlaine Harris wrote it. I mean the Twilight movie series stayed true to the books that were written for them and those movies are a HUGE success. I'm even going to write Charlaine Harris herself and ask her if she even got to put her approval on the Trueblood series. Because it truly sucks. They've managed to turn awesome books into a cheap daytime soap. And the acting couldn't be any worse if they tried. The writers of Trueblood added stuff that just really brings down the value of the books. WHY? WHY? WHY?     [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]]

1594488843|4.0|Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us<br /><br />My name is David Marquet, from Practicum, Inc and we help our customers structure their organizations to maximize the potential of their people. We call this leadership. When we talk with our clients one of the things we ask them is \\"do you need your boss to motivate you?\\" Very few people raise their hands. Thus, it wasn't a surprise to read in Daniel Pink's recent book, Drive, that people do not respond best to external motivation.<br /><br />Pink's book is very helpful because it clearly illuminates and explains what we've observed - that external motivation ends up feeling like manipulation and that people will do better in a structure that allows them to find their own intrinsic sources of motivation.<br /><br />What are the characteristics of those structures? Pink tells us they are structures that enable individual autonomy, mastery, and purpose. In our practice, we had been emphasizing control, competence, and connection as being important. While control parallels autonomy and mastery parallels autonomy, purpose is an element we had not singled out.<br /><br />We think Pink is right, though. Connecting your activity to a higher purpose does give people a reason beyond the immediate that seems necessary to sustain enduring loyalty to the mission. This was particularly true aboard submarines, where crews that understood how their tasks, however difficult, supported a greater goal (defending the Constitution, for example), performed better.<br /><br />Drive is a quick read and we recommend it.
B000002L7R|3.0|Another admittedly influential but overrated nonetheless synth-rock-pop release from the king's son.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Yeah - I know it seems cheesy but the first thing I thought of when I saw this film were the words spoken by Barbara Stanwyck in the Big Valley television series.  Cortez, when dealing with the Aztecs was appalled by the human sacrifice they practiced, one of the first moves made by Cortez after he took control was to release these folks so that they could go back to their families in peace.  Seems perfectly rational by our standards even today, however, all 500+ committed suicide because they were not being allowed to become one with their Gods.  Hard for us to understand, but this was their reality and Cortez failed to understand that.<br />This film does a beautiful job of telling the story, without taking sides, of what happened in Iraq after the initial invasion.  It shows how little we understood, and perhaps still do not understand the people we are trying to deal with there.  Some of the action maybe hard to follow if you do not know a good bit about the background.  The film demonstrates how many Americans that went there with good intentions and huge amounts of energy became disillusioned because it became clear very quickly that we acted on false information.  The main character - played by Matt Damon moves through the maze of misinformation trying to get at the truth.  The point at which the truth hits him full in the face comes from a very unexpected source and the simple statement towards the end of the film -- \\"YOU do not get to decide what happens here!\\"<br />The arrogance that we have displayed to date has played into the hands of those trying to bring about our demise, we must begin to display better judgement, and wisdom.  Seek to understand the motivating factors so that we can be smarter than those working against us and use those motivations in our favor.  This film goes a LONG way towards filling in the gaps for the American people so that they can grasp some of the Iraqi realities.<br />I was in Iraq back in the 1970's and when I heard all of the rhetoric concerning the proposed invasion, I thought that these folks MUST know something I do not.  Despite the fact that the existing regime was obviously bad, and had in and of itself been created by the United States (Sadam was put there by previous administrations) I could not see what the plan was for brining this country together once it was torn apart.  This film accurately shows that there in fact was no plan, and perhaps still there is no direction for how to unite a country that is made up of tribal elements.  See this film to understand a lot of why we are currently in the mess we are in.  We have GOT to begin to think outside the box, and turn this thing around.hetoric concerning the proposed invasion, I thought that these folks MUST know something I do not.

0307408833|4.0|I'd pretty much given up on GF baking.  It was all just too high calorie and low fiber.  However, this cookbook looked interesting (although my first thought--gf, vegan and sugar-free--that can't be any good!)  I've made the pumpkin muffins (caved in but still delicious.  I don't think I cooked them long enough) and cornbread (I've tried numerous recipe for this, but this was VERY MOIST).  My husband (non-celiac) liked them both despite the fact they were sugar-free and vegan.  I was happy to try baking with agave nectar, rice milk and garbanzo flour.  Despite being a dessert cookbook, there is a lot of fiber in here.  It's inspired me to attempt baking with some of the \\"newer\\" GF flours.  Thanks for making GF baking fun again!<br /><br />(NOTE:<br />She is honest about the spelt recipes not being gluten-free.<br />I also learn that rice milk is now GF--more new info every day!<br />I also tried substituting canola oil for coconut oil in one recipe per her suggested alternatives.  It still worked.<br />These flours are expensive, but you can make several recipes with just the BRM Flour mix.  I had many of the others at home already.)
B002QW7ALM|3.0|Pandorum thematically looks a lot like Alien:  Normal working schlubs are mysteriously awoken from hypersleep to deal with an alien anomaly.  Unfortunately eclipsed by the more muscular Aliens, Alien combined working class vs. middle class tension with claustrophobia.  After all, Ripley was just another hack doing her job and trying to get through the day - the fact that hypersleep put her at the mercy of corporate overseers isn't much different than the at-will employment contracts that everyone signs these days.<br /><br />Pandorum takes this idea one step further.  Our two protagonists, Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid), awaken with no memory of who they are.  They can't remember why they're on the ship, who reports to whom, or much else about the present.  The one thing they do remember is their mission to colonize an Earth-like planet known as Tanis.<br /><br />The cavernous ship, Elysium, serves as a series of set pieces for confrontations between the cannibals roaming the ship and human survivors. These survivors have been scrabbling so long that they no longer have a moral compass. In that regard Pandorum borrows elements established in Night of the Living Dead - the people you have to worry about aren't the zombies you can see but the allies you're locked in with.<br /><br />The story unspools through Bower and Payton's flashbacks as they slowly regain their memories. The motivations that propel them at first are slowly stripped away, one by one, until they are left with nothing but their core values.  The ending lays each character's true nature bare. In that regard Pandorum is refreshingly contained.  It has an explanation for everything, if you listen closely enough.<br /><br />Unfortunately Pandorum doesn't quite pull off all these elements successfully.  The cannibals look a combination of pale ghouls mixed with punk-style outfits. Director Christian Alvart tries hard to make them move oddly by speeding up the film, which becomes obvious when human actors are also in the frame.  Still, these ghouls aren't zombies at all - they breed, and it's that simple fact that makes them so unsettling.<br /><br />The other survivors don't have much more personality: the tough chick Nadia (played by the nearly incomprehensible Antje Traue who has a thick accent), the mute but loyal warrior Manh (Cung Le, mute but loyal), and the crazy old guy Leland (Eddie Rouse injecting much-needed humor a little too late). Fortunately, Quaid and Foster do the heavy lifting. There's a lot of important exposition in Pandorum but it's unfortunately lost in the soundtrack and all the screeching.<br /><br />The biggest challenge for Pandorum is to convince the audience that the protagonists are sane in an unfamiliar world.  Because we don't know much about the universe, we don't really have a standard of sanity to judge them by.  When certain Terrible Revelations (tm) are revealed it's not clear that this knowledge would drive someone insane.<br /><br />The race to restart the Elysium's reactor before the entire ship dies shifts gears quickly to a series of staccato revelations. Your familiarity with sci-fi tropes will determine how surprising these revelations are. I guessed all of them, but then I watch a lot of sci-fi. Mixing zombie and science fiction tropes, Pandorum is a surprisingly intelligent film.  Some choppy editing unfortunately prevents it from reaching its full potential.frame.

1441419519|3.0|This book shows the futility of the 5 star ranking system. How to I rate this? On the one hand, it's a classic and offers all sorts of fascinating philosophical insights. On the other hand, it's a translation and hence it's hard to judge as an original work given my lack of German. On the other hand (well, if I were Kali I'd have another hand), it's a book that I think a lot of people wouldn't particularly enjoy, and that I enjoyed only because I was in a certain sort of mood while reading it. In the end, I pick three stars, simply to say that it's got certain qualities, but it's not something to pick up entirely at random. And if you do, pick up a reliable translation rather than finding it free on Kindle...

B002VECM4A|5.0|Precious is a very difficult film to watch, the subject matter is really hard to swallow - a father that rapes his daughter many times, an abusive mother, and how that girl, Precious, lives with the damage done. This is a compelling movie, one that plays over and over for many women, more than should ever have to feel what Precious felt.<br /><br />My initial reaction to the film was one of predictability, amazement at Mo'Nique's performance, and yes it was a sad movie with a silver lining. In a rare moment for my wife, we watched the DVD bonus features just after the film. My view of the film completely changed. These are remarkable features. The biggest surprise was the audition tape for Gabourey Sibide, Precious. I've seen a lot of audition reels; this is the best I've ever seen. The interview with Lee Daniels, Tyler Perry, and Oprah Winfrey (her bit was the least interesting) about why they took on this film was illuminating. There is an incredible discussion with Sapphire, the author of the book Push. And then there is the classic 'behind the scenes' cast member talking heads that sets a whole new standard for what these should be. The interview with Gabby is incredible. There were a few more features, but these made me appreciate the film in a whole new light.<br /><br />Initially, Mo'Nique's performance was the standout. After reflection, every single cast member was spectacular. At first I understood the Academy Award going to Mo'Nique, she's a better known actress, the competition for supporting actress was much lighter, and the Academy needed to acknowledge this film somehow (the shame of not awarding it something would be too great). And I thought Sandra Bullock deserved best actress. After seeing the performance by Gabourey, that award went to the wrong person.<br /><br />Lee Daniels, the director, did a great job of bringing this story to light. Thank you to him for not making this film more real or accurate to the book. In his words, the film would have been X rated and probably lost a significant audience. I'm grateful that Oprah arrived to this film after it was shot, edited, and shown. I can only imagine what she would have done to Color Purple it, if she had been involved in the beginning. This story is so compelling that will not comment on technical flaws that would only miss the point.<br /><br />The film is rated R and is for mature audiences. The story is about a roughly sixteen year old girl, but it is very hard to recommend this film to younger viewers. There are graphic psychological scenes, mental and physical abuse, and a father raping his daughter. However, there is no nudity in the film. There is strong language throughout. The difficult aspect of this film, the exact audience that should see this film, thirteen or fourteen year old girls, will probably never see the film.<br /><br />I loved this film. It is powerful and moving. There is nothing fun about watching this film. And the pain is that this kind of thing happens every day. Prepare your handkerchief.bably lost a significant audience.

This concert was rather gentler than the Pulse tour concert with more   personal footage and out-takes. The material was a mix of the old and the new   and its really a blast to see half of the Floyd and 2/3 Roxy playing together.  The singing is getting a little less piowerful - I mean the man is in his   60's now; but he's still quite wonderful.  It also makes you curious as to what else he has lying around in that studio of his.  Its a shame Richard Wright is gone - it will never be quite the same if he's   not there. Whatever though - I will always want more: the man is inspired!!!!

0688014291|4.0|It is likely reasonable to deem The One Minute Manager as a classic among management books. The obvious theme is managing people and employees, but the cover promises ways to simplify one's life, get more done and be less stressed. Along these lines, the authors have penned several other tomes including The One Minute Father/Mother, The One Minute Sales Person and others.<br />The One Minute Manager emphasizes human dynamics and managing people as a means of achieving results. It might seem foreign or simplistic to some who espouse technology over people, blame employees first due to a preference for a top-down culture, care more for corporations than people, and ironically end up serving neither or those whose books and programs are not served by conceding to the fundamentals, but that highlights the need for the book even more.<br /><br />At first, the notion might seem absurd or a stretch, but the book is not a gimmick. The authors are a Ph.D. holder and M.D. respectively and have based the short and straightforward book on research into human behaviour and stimuli. This was my second time reading The One Minute Manager (The `One-Minute' Manager?) and it felt as interesting as the first time, which was back in 1996. After all these years, the advice of Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson rings true as does the endorsement of C-level persons from firms like Chevron and Jack In The Box.<br /><br />Perhaps like the reader, the book's narrator is a somewhat incredulous and curious person who is justly sceptical about the concept. He meets a man who is a `One Minute Manager' and has three tips. While these might sound simple and obvious the detail and methodology is the key. Using a story format, the book hones in on the three basic components of human management each of which should take approximately a minute to accomplish following the initial discussions and training that come with being a new employee or the initiation of a new project.<br /><br />1- One Minute Goal Setting. The technique insists on writing one's actionable goals down in a concise format of one page with no more than 250 words. That leads to knowing how to constantly measure performance, reviewing them and agreeing to them with one's manager.<br /><br />2- One Minute Praising. This is part of an upfront contract. Praise should follow the commendable action immediately and be specific. Impart sincerity by offering a slight physical touch and encourage more of the same.<br /><br />3- One Minute Reprimand. This is also part of an upfront understanding. The criticism happens as soon as the manager knows of the mistake and is very specifically about a behaviour and not the person. This is followed by a few seconds of silence and a reversion to the praise of the person overall. Do not dwell on it. Be tough at first in order to make sure the pleasant part comes second.<br /><br />People Who Feel Good About Themselves Produce Results.

B0014WSWTY|5.0|In this review I will try to compare various complete recordings of Beethoven's nine symphonies plus Carlos Kleiber's CD with Symphonies number 5 and 7 (on DG). Concerning Carlos Kleiber it is easily done: I will advice anybody who appreciates Beethoven (or who think they might appreciate Beethoven) to buy his CD. I doubt you can find better versions of those two works. When I mention Karajan in this review I refer only to his first complete set of Beethoven's symphonies for DG from 1963 with the Berliner Philharmoniker. The other complete sets I will write about are: Osmo Vanska and the Minnesota Orchestra (Bis), Jos van Immerseel and Anima Eterna (Zig Zag), David Zinman and Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich (Arte Nova), Herbert Blomstedt and Staatskapelle Dresden (Brilliant). All orchestras mentioned here perform on modern instruments except Immerseel's Anima Eterna.<br /><br />I will go through the symphonies one by one and give short comments on the various recordings. I will start in reverse order since I guess most people will be interested in the late symphonies primarily.<br /><br />Karajan plays a terrific and grand 9th (\\"Choral\\") - his wild gestures and colourful style fit the work well - he is a true romantic in the first romantic symphony in musical history. It is the only 9th I have heard in which all the movements really shine, for instance in Vanska's recording only the two last movements really work for me, but then again those two are amazing - you can hear every polyphonic detail in the choral finale. Immerseel gives us a good \\"slim\\" 9th (only 33 musicians in the orchestra which though is 9 more than in the other symphonies). Zinman's recording lacks verve and excitement in the two first movements, but his adagio is pretty and the finale is gripping. A special feature in Zinman's 9th is that he plays it with Beethoven's original general pause in bar 747. Blomstedt plays a vibrant 9th with a beautiful truly romantic adagio (16+ minutes long like Karajan's) and a glorious finale. Thomas Dausgaard with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra &Ouml;rebro (on Simax as part of a complete recording of Beethoven's orchestral music which I am NOT reviewing here) is - as a whole - the best recent (2009) 9th I have heard, but text and translation of Schiller's ode are not included in the booklet. Some might say that the scherzo in Dausgaard's hands is too aggressive, but I find it fresh and spirited.<br /><br />Zinman gives you a good 7th but not a great one. The winning set in the 7th is no doubt Immerseel's who's ravishing exhilarating account is full of verve and vigour. Richard Wagner described this symphony as \\"the apotheosis of dance\\" and he had/has a point: This is a symphony that demands a \\"mobile\\" orchestra - a dancing orchestra. And here Immerseel and Anima Eterna have the advantage of a smaller orchestra that can really dance. Vanska's version of the 7th really disappointed me. It is simply boring - he plays it too slowly. But if you buy Carlos Kleiber's 7th in addition to Vanska's complete cycle you will be doing just fine. What I have said about the 7th also could be said about the 8th  - again Immerseel's interpretation is the more lively. But I don't think you will be disappointed in this symphony with either Karajan, Zinman, Vanska or Blomstedt. Karajan's 7th and 8th are highlights of his set.<br /><br />Karajan's approach is much too heavy for the \\"Pastoral\\" (the 6th Symphony). Same thing can be said about Blomstedt's. Vanska's is the best version of this light-hearted symphony (a rare example of program music in Beethoven's oeuvre). Vanska's \\"Scene by the brook\\" (the title of the 2nd movement) has a beautiful, tranquil and romantic atmosphere that I find very appealing. I didn't like the \\"Pastoral\\" before I heard Vanska conduct it. \\"The merry gathering of the country folk\\" is as merry as it should be and \\"Thunder Storm\\" really sounds like thunder. Zinman isn't bad in this one either, the 1st movement in particular conveys the \\"Pleasant, cheerful feelings which awaken in people on arrival in the country\\" to the listener.<br /><br />In the first movement of the famous 5th Immerseel plays very fast (maybe too fast) and takes no prisoners. It is a very extreme approach, but it does appeal to me somehow especially because the rest of the symphony seems to follow as a logic conclusion. Vanska plays it slower and gives you time to both try to feel and figure out what Beethoven intended with this work. Karajan might be overdoing it a little bit in the 5th, but it is certainly not boring. Zinman plays the fast movements almost as fast as Immerseel and presents a decent 5th, although I miss some grandeur when it should reach its climax in the 4th movement.<br /><br />I am not very enthusiastic about Beethoven's 4th Symphony, but maybe I just haven't listened to it enough to get to know it better. The recording I will choose to get to know it better will probably be Vanska's.<br />.<br />In the 3rd Symphony (\\"Eroica\\") Vanska slowly builds up tension creating a truly heroic feeling - definitely my favourite.<br /><br />The 1st and 2nd Symphonies are not core repertoire Beethoven and I suppose most performers don't really care too much about them. At least when I listen to them they only really make sense and appeal to me in the hands of Osmo Vanska.<br /><br />I almost forgot about Herbert Blomstedt. Maybe because his cycle is forgettable in the sense that it just repeats an approach similar to Karajan's.<br /><br />When it comes to sound Anima Eterna's set is definitely the winner. Not only because it has the best recording technique, but also because the small orchestra enables you to hear every single instrument in the orchestra. With larger orchestras the sound becomes somewhat blurred and you can't tell which instruments are playing what. As I said the Karajan set discussed here was recorded in 1963. Blomstedt's is from the late `70s (the 9th from 1980), Zinman's is from the `90s, Immerseel's and Vanska's were both recorded in the beginning of the new millennium and are of course superior in terms of sound quality.<br /><br />So my recommendation: Jos van Immerseel with Anima Eterna is the best overall set, but if you don't like the idea of period instruments and a small ensemble choose Osmo Vanska with the Minnesota Orchestra. In addition to that buy Carlos Kleiber's 5th and 7th and Karajan's or Dausgaard's 9th.gs which awaken in people on arrival in the country\\" to the listener.

0143036556|4.0|Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse,\\" is a bold and compelling work which I highly recommend reading.  Diamond provides a sweeping view of why societies endure or collapse.  Diamond provides different examples of past civilizations and of more modern societies.    Among the societies dissected are the Norse Vikings of Greenland, the Anasazi of the American Southwest, the Polynesians of Easter Island and the Mayan Empire of the Yucatan, civilizations that rose and fell.      Diamond identifies three culprits of societal collapse: depletion of soil;  scarcity of water; and deforestation with somewhat different permutations in each case. Associated with these factors is an expanded population whose numbers could no longer be sustained.  Diamond skillfully weaves the ingredients of societal collapse into a common thread by providing many interesting historical details and lesser-known facts.      Diamond is on shakier ground in the latter half of the book. There is a need for tighter editing which would have reduced redundant narrative; and in particular, the section about the Norse culture of Greenland.    Many of his conclusions are spot-on, others more speculative: for example, the comparative analysis of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the two very different nations that share the Island of Hispaniola. The recent major earthquake in Haiti makes it clear that Haiti exists as a mostly-failed nation state.  Weak or non-existent institutions have made Haiti almost completely reliant upon foreign aid. The Dominican Republic occupying the eastern half of the island is comparatively wealthy, stable and exists with much stronger institutions.  The differences between the two are mostly cultural.  The effects of poor land use in Haiti have resulted in severe environmental consequences to the western side of Hispaniola.     It may not be politically correct to \\"out\\" culture as the main reason for a failed state, especially when it exists in modern time. It may appear as condemnationof a people when the culture itself is the main element behind societal collapse. It is easier for Diamond to provide clear analysis on the cultural reasons for collapse of historic civilizations than for a failing society that exists today.    \\"Collapse\\" came out a few years ago. At the time, the situation in Rwanda was compelling front-page news. What Haiti and Rwanda have in common is that both countries are severely overpopulated in terms of the resources available to support their populations.     Because of international aid, the shrinking modern world and the ability of people to relocate, to \\"vote with their feet,\\" a modern failing society does not collapse in the same way that a historic civilization did. As the world continues to shrink, people will migrate elsewhere legally or illegally.    Comparatively high death rates nothwithstanding, overpopulated countries with unsustainably high birth rates like Haiti and Rwanda will continue to \\"export\\" their surplus population to other nations.   While Haiti and Rwanda are small in size, China, India, Pakistan and many of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., Nigeria are overpopulated. The migration of people away from overpopulated nations is already a central issue of the 21st century.
B000060O58|5.0|There is a certain sort of splendour, grandeur and joyous energy to these recordings that you just don't find in modern ones (it simply makes you happy). However the sound is not as good as in newer recordings - these recordings are from the sixties. If you want modern, period instrument interpretations with clean sound and some of the same qualities, I would recommend Jordi Savall's recording of the Brandenburg Concertos (on Astr&eacute;e/Naive) and Ton Koopman's recording of the Orchestral Suites (on Erato/Warner Classics).<br /><br />22 Oct 2009<br />Since I wrote the review above I have been listening a lot to Jordi Savall's recording of the Orchestral Suites (on Astree/Naive). And by now I must say it is my favourite. Savall presents these great works with grand majestic solemnity. Besides his interpretation of the famous Air from the Third Suite is the most beautiful version I have ever heard. So my recommendation is Savall in both the Brandenburg Concertos and the Orchestral Suites.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Arrived on time and in mint condition. Just does not get any better than this for true Beatles fans.
B00006JQU1|3.0|I have only been listening to nine different recordings of these works, so I am in fact a complete novice in the field (and no musicologist at all), all the same I will try to give short comments on these nine interpretations that just might help you to choose which set you want to buy.<br /><br />My personal favourite is no doubt John Holloway's recording (on ECM). When I first heard it I had only been listening to Shlomo Mintz (on DG) and Hilary Hahn (on Sony), so I feared the great Ciaccona/Chaconne of BWV 1004, because both of those artists' interpretations of that movement sounded like musical warfare, full of shrieks and noises. But Hallelujah! Guess what happened? The movement made sense to me for the first time - in Holloway's hands it is actually music! And the rest of the set also sparkles in Holloway's recording. What is so special about Holloway's version is that it has an almost spiritual, metaphysical aspect to it that nobody else achieves. It is a recording full of sublime transcendental beauty. That aspect of course is emphasized by the wonderful church acoustics (another great Manfred Eicher production from ECM). The booklet contains a performer's note and a few facsimile pages of Bach's beautiful handwritten score. If you are looking for just one recording, you don't really have to read further - I recommend that you buy Holloway's set.<br /><br />If you have not bought Holloway's set yet, I have to say a little more about Mintz and Hahn: The aggressive approach in Mintz' Ciaccona/Chaconne is more or less present throughout Mintz' recording and in my opinion his playing does not quite justify it - it is \\"agitated\\" without having a reason to be so. If you want the sort of expressive power which Mintz is trying to put into these works Nathan Milstein (on DG) is a better option (NB: There is an  earlier recording from EMI which I am not reviewing here). The problem with Hahn is that you are more impressed than moved; she plays fast - some might even say that she is superficial and skates over the essentials. Hahn also has a tendency to romanticize in the slow movements. Besides it is not a complete recording, she only plays half the works (BWV 1004, 1005 and 1006). However, her version of BWV 1006 is probably my favourite because of its exquisite, exuberant brilliance that fits that partita well.<br /><br />Sigiswald Kuijken (on DHM) is almost as good as Holloway and he almost reaches Holloway's metaphysical heights, but his Ciaccona/Chaconne is not entirely perfect, it sounds like separate movements put together rather than as a whole. The performance has rougher edges than Holloway's, which can be a good thing. (NB: I am reviewing the 2001 release from DHM not the earlier release on the same label.)<br /><br />Viktoria Mullova (on Onyx) and Rachel Podger (on Channel) are more down to earth than Holloway, but they both play beautifully. Maybe Podger is a somewhat overrated performer of Bach's music for solo violin. Her recording has been praised by numerous critics and it is so beautiful that I would like to like it more, but isn't it just a little bit boring? I am listening to it right now and again I get this sort of feeling: \\"Yes, it is beautiful, but why am I listening to it?\\" That question answers itself when I listen to Holloway or Kuijken. With Kuijken and Holloway playing the music explains itself, it says: \\"I will just explain how this sounds.\\" If you are looking for clarity and serenity choose Mullova. Make sure you buy the new Onyx set not the old Philips release!<br /><br />If you want the slow movements played slow and the rest played beautifully by a young talented violinist Julia Fischer (on Pentatone) should be your choice.<br /><br />Henryk Szeryng's first recording (on Sony) from 1955 is very serious and intense, a haunting (but also demanding) experience. Szeryng later made another recording for DG but I have not heard it (yet). Of course you should expect less than perfect sound on a recording that is more than fifty years old.<br /><br />Mullova, Kuijken, Podger and Holloway play period instruments.<br /><br />Szeryng, Mintz, Milstein, Hahn and Fischer play modern instruments.ng that is more than fifty years old.<br /><br />Mullova, Kuijken, Podger and Holloway play period instruments.<br /><br />Szeryng, Mintz, Milstein, Hahn and Fischer play modern instruments.

That's right, better than The Yes Album, Fragile and Close to The Edge, better than Emerson Lake and Palmer, Tarkus, Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery, better than In The Court of The Crimson King, Lizard, Lark's Tongue's In Aspic and Red, better than Days of Future Past, In Search of the Lost Chord, On The Threshold of A Dream, To Our Children's Children's Children and Question of Balance, better than Genesis' own Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway and A Trick of The Tail, and better than any other one of the many fine progressive rock albums of the era.  In fact, discard the progressive rock label; this album is a great, great album period.       If you do not own this album, and you love music of any kind, it is an absolute must purchase.  Musically, lyrically and artistically this is an absolute masterpiece and as guitarist Steve Hackett has noted, it is a unique album, neither Genesis nor any other artist has released an album that sounds like this one.      Why is this album so fine?  It combines wonderful musical composition, intelligent and poetic lyrics, dramatic vocals and instrumentals, virtuoso performances, elements of classical, jazz, English folk and rock music married together, and tasteful cover art (for those that remember LPs).  Although every song is a highlight (with the possible exception of the witty but overly wordy \\"Battle of Epping Forest\\"), three songs stand out: the opening \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" (with Peter Gabriel's wonderful acapella opening and Mike Rutherford's pastoral guitar/flute/keyboard closing); \\"Firth of Fifth\\" (a Tony Banks composition that contains an extended keyboard [with arpeggio flourishes] introduction played by Banks, a beautiful Peter Gabriel flute solo and Steve Hackett's incredible, haunting guitar solo, his finest with Genesis); and \\"The Cinema Show\\" (which contains beautiful Gabriel penned lyrics [borrowing from Shakespeare and Greek mythology] and an extended instrumental piece composed by Michael Rutherford that features wonderful keyboard work by Tony Banks and percussion by Phil Collins).  The album also contains \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe),\\" Genesis' first \\"hit,\\" \\"More Fool Me,\\" with Phil Collins taking the lead vocals, and \\"After The Ordeal\\" a beautiful Steve Hackett instrumental piece.               Lyrically, much of the album, and in particular the opening \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" and the closing reprise of same, \\"Aisle of Plenty,\\" concerns the commercialization of English society, and contains wordplay on British references that will be lost on those who have not spent any time in Britain.      After their next studio release, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, and the tour promoting same, Peter Gabriel would leave the band and embark on his very successful and creative solo career.  Steve Hackett would soon follow (but only after two more fine studio releases, A Trick of The Tail and Wind And Wuthering).  Genesis, with Phil Collins as its front-man, would eventually morph into a pop-hit making machine.  But Genesis would never record anything that would equal this beautiful album.  While I prefer the LP to any of the digital versions, the music is so fine it is worth owning in any format.  I would recommend purchasing the 1994 \\"Definitive Edition\\" while it is still available, as the newer (SACD overseas/DSD in the USA) release of this recording is remixed, and although the newer version is cleaner sounding, it is also louder and compressed.
B000TGCR38|5.0|This is an amazing, exciting story based on history. It sheds light on the killing and torturing of the jewish population of Netherland  before and during World War II. Good acting, excellent directing.<br />It is worth seeing it. Especially for the purpose of future generations<br />to see what not to allow to happen again!
0061537934|5.0|Upon reading the first page, the Reader is immediately captivated.  Right from the beginning, one falls in love with Enzo, the canine protagonist who promises to break our hearts, but shares with us an intimacy so personal and poignant that one will never be the same again.  You will never look at a dog who strives to be a man the same way ever again either upon reading this.    Garth Stein has entered into the realm of emotion few experience and are blessed when they do.  At 321 pages, you'll wish there was no end.  The prose is beautiful, as are the characters.  Be prepared to read a book you will not be able to put down.

0307454541|5.0|This book was a bit slow starting up but then I couldn't put it down.  My book group read it and everybody commented that the book was addictive.  People found themselves sneaking off to read it at 2 in the morning.  I found Steig Larrson a very appealing writer.  In fact, I got a crush on him as I was reading.  The book is more than just a thriller; the characters have some real depth.  And I love all the Swedish places and names.  The book makes you want to take a vacation in Sweden.  I'm now in the middle of the second book, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire,\\" also terrific.
B000002LRX|5.0|There's little more to add to the reviews already posted here. Suffice it to say that this is definitely one of the most bizarre heavy albums ever released on a major label. Most of the songs feature reasonably conventional heavy riffs, but pretty much everything else is out of whack. The arrangements range from inspired to really strange, odd samples pop up everywhere (aborigines chanting, crickets chirping, weird strings etc) and the vocals have to be heard to be believed. By now it's no secret that Patton is one of the most diverse and gifted vocalists of his generation, but I imagine it must have been quite a shock for most people to hear what he was doing here when this was released. He emotes, snarls, growls, screeches, deadpans and sometimes uses a megaphone for good measure. The lyrics are uniformly excellent, and the songwriting is amazingly consistent. To this day, I only skip a single song (\\"RV\\"). Some of the songs are even quite funny (\\"Be Aggressive\\" is an ironic treasure, for one).    Personal favorites: \\"Smaller and Smaller\\", \\"Crack Hitler\\", \\"Caffeine\\", and the somewhat inelegantly titled \\"Jizzlobber\\". The latter is probably the heaviest song of their career, but at the same time, almost paradoxically, the most moving. It starts off with an eerie repeated note played on the keyboards ala Psycho,  until a heavy, fuzzy riff crashes in, played with a lot of postprocessing. Patton gives his most deranged performance here, shrieking and growling so intensely that half the lyrics are rendered indecipherable. This is too bad, because these are quite intriguing, featuring lines such as     \\"They will sum it all up in a sentence,  A verdict made by those who know\\"    and    \\"Cruel words sleep above me,  Mounting, teasing\\"    The song proceeds through various sections, each heavier than the last, with Patton finally proclaiming \\"I am what I've done\\" and wailing \\"I'm sorry\\" over and over again. The song ends with a choir and organ section that is both crazed andhaunting at the same time. Overall, the song radiates a feeling of tremendous remorse and shame that is deeply moving and disturbing.     This is probably their best album, although certainly not their only good one. \\"Album of the Year\\" is also worth checking out, although it's nowhere near as aggressive.

B00337KM2S|5.0|In the run-up to the recent 2010 Academy Awards, it seemed like the only thing people could talk about was the matchup between the mighty \\"Avatar\\" and little \\"The Hurt Locker\\". Both fine films in their own right. But lost in all the noisy hub-bub was another small, marvelous, nominated film. It had no space aliens or bombs going off. Instead it was just a well made, quiet, intelligent film about people called \\"Up in the Air\\".<br /><br />In \\"Up in the Air\\" we meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who makes his living traveling from company to company firing/laying off employees in the downturn economy. In other words, he's a professional hatchetman. He does his job with a certain sense of style and grace. He sets people adrift, gently. He travels without end, living a life, that is mainly made up of airport bars & lounges, rental car counters and chain hotels. What we hate about traveling he loves. His one kick in life seems to be collecting exclusive memberships in travel industry clubs, that offer big perks to those on the road and in the skies. What he dosn't have is a real home, wife, children or significant other ETC. Instead he espouses and lives an insular life without any true emotional responsiblities or commitments.<br /><br />This all changes when two women enter his life. One is Natalie (Anna Kendrick) a smart, energetic, young woman, who's business ideas could lead to the end of Ryan's nomadic wanderings (she wants employees fired via the internet). The other is Alex (Vera Farmiga), a mature, sexy business woman, who seems 'to get' Ryan's interests and lifestyle. Ryan and Alex meet at various junctures on the road for a series of sexual liasons. Together, these two interesting women turn Ryan's life upside down, causing him to finally question the path he has chosen for himself.<br /><br />Writer/Director, Jason Rietman has created a film, which is a wonderful character study. It portrays a man, who at first thinks he knows it all, but winds up eventually questioning everything. I love the way Reitman strips away his characters, until finally the truth is revealed. \\"Up in the Air\\" has a smart and funny script, which has razor-sharp, intelligent dialogue. It treats its characters with respect. I really love the fact that this movie dosn't try to tie everything up with a fake Hollywood ending. Instead the film leaves us on a more ambiguous note.<br /><br />The cast in this film is steller. George Clooney essentially gives the best performance of his career (so far). Anna Kendrick also gives a poised, well acted performance as the young upstart, who is both a pain and conscious for Clooney's character. But the real discovery of the film is actress, Vera Farmiga. She really gives a \\"star is born\\" type of performance. Its hard to match an actor like Clooney, charisma-wise, but Vera Farmiga manages to do it. Her sexy, smart business woman really jumps out at you. Its an amazing performance. I predict big things for this actress in the future.<br /><br />I think \\"Up in the Air\\" was one of the best movies I saw all year. Its both heartfelt and humorous. A great piece of storytelling.

0743297334|1.0|I just finished reading \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Ernest Hemingway and can't imagine why he's so popular. The story was aimless meandering - pointless and plotless, and the characters were pitiful. I wouldn't normally have chosen to read it, but it was the selection of the month for my book discussion group.<br /><br />The main character, Jake, told the story in the first person but gave away very little information about himself. He and his loser friends wandered around Europe, staying in various degrees of intoxication throughout the book. He seemed to be having a platonic love affair with the main female character, Brett, who came to him with her problems and disappointments, declared her hopeless love for him, and then went off to sleep with one of his drunken friends.<br /><br />Nothing ever really happened in the book; no mission to accomplish, no barrier to overcome, no antagonist to beat. Hemingway spent very little effort describing his characters and far too much effort reporting on the scenery. There was alot of dialogue, but inane, redundant, and mostly meaningless. I don't know what Heminway's personal views on ethnic and racial diversity were, but this book was definintely not \\"politically correct.\\"<br /><br />The only real 'action' (if you can call it that) was a very boring description of an uneventful fishing trip to Spain, and then a fiesta and the accompanying fireworks and bullfights. At this point Hemingway broke all the literary rules of perspective and switched from first person point-of-view to omniscient and proceeded to go into detailed descriptions of the bull-fighters and their thoughts and motivations. It was the most enthusiasm he'd shown throughout the entire book.<br /><br />None of the characters knew what they really wanted and let life drift by them in a drunken fog. If this book has any message at all, then it must be that life is meaningless without a goal to reach or a cause to believe in.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|i was really worried when ALW first announced a follow-up to phantom, i didn't think it was a very good idea, but he has gone ahead with it and as a fan of Lloyd Webber i have accepted it. after listening to the album i found myself swept along once more by his music, and i totally bought into the story. granted it is not the greatest story ever told, but it is entertainment after all. he was never going to match the success of the original, so on that basis i went in with an open mind with no high expectations and was greatly impressed (and relieved!)that it works. dont expect to hear THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA all over again, because this is very different. i appreciate it for what it is, it wont be everyones cup of tea, BUT IT IS NOT THE FLOP EVERYONE EXPECTED IT TO BE. the theater reviews are very mixed which is very healthy, at least Andrew Lloyd Webber hasn't lost his touch and is still writing original works for the stage which is more than i can say for anyone else. he has always been a target for harsh criticism but its about time to give credit where credit is due. the cast and all musicians deserve praise for their work. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0805091742|4.0|The Checklist Manifesto is not just a great book and a valuable resource for all who read it. It is a warning sign on the slippery slope to technological disaster. My first thought, even before I finished this book, was to buy a number of copies, carry them on my various visits to doctors, ask if he or she has read the book, and, if the answer was no, then hand a copy to that doctor and say, \\"Please read this, my life may depend on it.\\" It's that important, and may save your life, too.<br />Phrases like the following show he's aware of the problems:<br /><br />\\". . . the volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual capacity to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably.\\"<br /><br />\\"Medicine has become the art of managing extreme complexity--and a test as to whether such complexity can, in fact, be humanly mastered.\\"<br /><br />I could add more, but you get the idea. However, the key question, once framed by Mark Twain, is not where we stand but whether we're gaining or losing. For all the good ideas in this book, the answer is still in doubt.<br /><br />Here's why: As good as this book is, and as important as checklists are, neither are sufficient to the problem at hand. In fact, we don't really know the dimensions of the problem (the most important of these is obviously time). It's not just managing complexity; it's more like triaging complexity. Triage is something doctors like Gawande know about, but here it is in brief for those who might not. On a battlefield someone has to decide quickly (given the circumstance and the resources) if the wounded soldier who just arrived either a) will be worth those resources, or b) won't be (too difficult to save), or c) will probably survive if left alone.<br /><br />Of course, these categories don't apply exactly to the problem we're discussing here. But there has to be some comparable, and simple, classification system we can use to begin managing this problem. For example, a) can the immediate situation be handled with our standard procedure, or b) do we need to refine our procedure, or c) do we need to completely rethink our approach. If we rephrase Pareto's Principle (more commonly known as the 80/20 rule), we could say 80% of situations can be dealt with using standard procedures (20% of our effort). Fine, but how do we deal with the remaining 20% of situations? We can't simply say they deserve 80% of our effort because it may take more than just effort. It may take a extensive revision of all our procedures.<br /><br />What we need to understand is that checklists are just the first crude defense -- albeit effective -- against the increasing complexity of modern technology (especially computers). Checklists are just the first step toward addressing the safe flow of the exploding information that necessarily accompanies expanding technological complexity.<br /><br />Yet, as good a job as Atul Gawande does in telling this story, it is shocking to note he doesn't see the opportunity for our potential extrication. He has discovered that medicine is lacking a much-needed discipline. However, he seems unaware that discipline already exists in abundance and is taught around the world. That discipline is engineering.  He touches on this in Chapter 3 (\\"The End of The Master Builder\\") about the problems of complex structures. But he doesn't refer to any of the classic engineering books on failure, books designed to improve the discipline (for example see Henry Petroski). Nor does he make the obvious connection between the needed safety of these buildings, the safety we all desire for commercial aviation, and the medical profession: they are all responsible for millions of lives. Nor does he offer any insight as to why the medical profession has been so lax in recognizing the safety procedures of these other industries.<br /><br />He doesn't but I will. One reason is that I've been told by many doctors, \\"What we do is not so much science as art.\\" Therein liesthe problem. Medicine may be part art and part science, but what it mostly needs to be is engineering. And what it needs to do -- and The Checklist Manifesto is a good first step in the right direction -- is learn from various engineering applications and (as he rightly acknowledges) acquire their discipline. Medicine must acknowledge it can benefit from the methodology of engineering. Only then can doctors exercise the self-discipline necessary to use that methodology.it mostly needs to be is engineering.

Set all the critiques aside and see the movie if ofor no other reason to watch Mo'Nique as Mary.  There hasn't been a performance that good in years, sorry Sandra.  Also worth an award, are the performances of the stunning Paula Patton as Ms. Rain and Mariah Carey as Mrs. Weiss.  Carey is proof that Hollywood can take a stunning women and make her look average. Enjoy the movie, it's very well done and worth the time and deserving of its acclaim.  But its these ladies and Gabourey Sidibe that make it worth the admission.

0307463745|3.0|This book is filled with some great advice for those who want to start their own business, have their own business, or are just interested in the subject.    As a fan of 37 Signals the company and a frequent reader of their blog, I was excited when Rework was first announced (so excited I pre-ordered it). From the initial descriptions, I was excited to read a full-length book from Jason Fried and David Heinemeir Hansson. My hope was that they would expand on the ideas frequently discussed on their blog and elaborate on some more of their personal experiences in running a very successful small company.    Unfortunately, if you are familiar with the authors, their blog, or their previous book \\"Getting Real\\", then very little of the content in this book is new. All of the lessons and chapters feel like retreads of previous material, even down to some of the analogies such as \\"be like a chef\\" or \\"be a curator\\".     So while I think some of the lessons in this book are great, I feel that it deserves a 3 star rating because so few of these lessons are new material.     On a similar note, I think my biggest gripe here might be with the length of the book: it may appear to be 270 pages, but there are only about 100 pages of actual content in Rework. The book is really about 100 or so one-page essays, separated by a full page illustration between each section.     I really wanted to be excited by this book but having read their previous output, unfortunately I found very little new material to digest and the illustrations between sections feel like nothing more than filler.     So if you are not familiar with 37 Signals or their blog, and you dream of one day starting your own company, then this book is filled with great advice. But if you are familiar with the company, their blog, or \\"Getting Real\\", there is almost nothing new here for you.

As Henrietta was going through I felt like I was right there.  I could really feel the pain of Deborah and her family.  Rebecca Skloot brought this truth alive with compassion and empathy. Thank you for not being too afraid to get the whole story. It was like a well of fresh water that dried up too soon.

B00005U8EM|4.0|Groundhog Day has to be one of my favorite movies. It's not so much that it is funny, it's more that most films are so plot driven that you don't get a chance to know the characters.    Here we get a plot driven movie in which you do get to know the characters, sort of. The one character who changes is Phil, because he lives the same day over and over again.    I love the scene where Phil learns French so he can charm Rita. How do those bar maids carry so many beers in one hand?    I was confused about the old man who dies no matter what Phil does to save him.    I thought he did live, because there were two old men at the party at the end of the film. A friend finally convinced me that they were the bank guards.    The movie is too long, but maybe that is the point.    I like to find the moment that makes the unbelievable believable and I think it is when Phil is hit on the head with a shovel. Also, the snow storm could be the magic event that makes the story work.    Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and I hope that someday Rita starts to like white chocolate.

014241493X|5.0|I am a high school teacher, and I am one of the sponsors of the student-led Teen Book Club.  The students picked this book, and I really enjoyed reading it.  I am 24-yrs-old and had so much fun being transported back to high school.     The author does a great job painting each character, and the reader can really feel the various dynamics of their friendship.  I laughed out loud at the immature, intricately-planned shenanigans that were played out at the beginning and end of the book.  Also, the book is a mystery, so the reader is very engaged throughout the book, which is great for teen readers with shorter attention spans.  There is also a sweet high school love story intertwined in it all.    I would recommend this for teenagers, and for adults who can appreciate the fun innocence of the little bit of freedom one gets in high school.  You get a taste of the excitement of a first kiss, a first car, a first party, graduation, first road trip, and a first love.  Overall, just a great read.
B000P0J09C|5.0|Wonderful film.  was good to see it again.  Had forgotten several scenes since last watching the film - many years ago.  I'm in the process of collecting all of Vincent D'Onofrio's films.  Consider him EXCELLENT actor (and, recently read that he has a daughter named \\"Leila\\" - which is MY name - and, very unusual).
B001F0TM5I|4.0|I must admit the first time viewing this on Cable and having never heard of it I kept trying to figure out what's this all about and for those first third of the film I was ready to turn it off but the longer I stuck with it the more it pulled me in to see Kurt Russell in such a role was like a WTFriggin moment!  He's truly bad ass in this Movie until Part Two.      For those of us getting older but can recall those films (the younger audience may not understand the style at all and pan it)and now used to formula boilerplate Hollywood I found it quite good especially when it got to Part Two and the tables were turned and started out thinking this sucks to actually enjoying it being different and some of it's shock value which is trademark QT and I finally understood later when I found out it was his work it all made sense.      If you want formula boilerplate out of the file cabinet movies look elsewhere but if you want that Drive-in Movie feel of the 60's/70's off the wall formula where victim women get their revenge in the second half during awesome chase scenes - enjoy!  QT simply has a different eye for sure - just check out Inglorious Bastards - perhaps the most unique slant ever on the Nazi's and WWII.    Some will hate it others will enjoy its STYLE and Kurt Russell was great!
B0035G9ABQ|4.0|I agree with pretty much every review of the songs on this album by user Anthony Cantu below. However, I think of the song \\"Kids With Guns\\" every time I hear this album. Don't get me wrong, I will be listening to this for a long time (and for the majority, I have the songs in my head), but that one track from Demon Days had the sick bass line (the closest on Plastic that might compete is off \\"Empire Ants\\" in the second half), it had the sweet hook \\"push it, push, it's real, push it...push it real, push it, push, push it's real...,\\" and the old school guitar climax at the end that defined Gorillaz for me. Although, the Lou Reed track is very satisfying, as well as all songs in collaboration with Little Dragon and Mos Def. ANd I think at parts the symphonies are slightly awkward, but because they are so avante-garde and well composed, it makes up for any lack of consistency. Damon was just being an addict there.<br /><br />Also, the exhaustive and disconnected backstory behind the Gorillaz' \\"whereabouts\\" during the last five years, as published in many magazines before the release, is a bit wonky and ridiculous. It doesn't help me understand the album at all.<br /><br />Very happy customer, all around!
B0025KVLV0|5.0|The only thing that disappoints me is how much better Let It Be Naked sounds. That being said let me explain. I realize Let It Be Naked has alternate takes and less orchestration, etc. But, there are certain takes that are identical like For You Blue which just sound so much better. Why do they sound better? Because they were mixed. I feel each album really should be mixed slightly just to help improve the sound. It isn't changing the music. It's still the Beatles. Especially on the Beatles first two stereo albums. Those stereo mixes are terrible. Left music and right vocals.

It was lamb-basted by the church for it's supposed \\"anti-religous\\" theme and \\"subversion of children's minds\\". Interesting how the Catholic church found the oppressive, mythical \\"Magesterium\\" likened to itself. In fact there was no allusion direct or implied against any bonified organized religous group... yet we are being denied our right to artistic license and free speach in the USA as a result.  I suggest flooding the studio/producers with letters demanding the two sequals be made, and true to their original format as well! The only other way of actually realising the outcome is by reading installments number two (The Subtle Knife) and three (The Amber Spyglass) in the trilogy written by Phillip Pullman. Thank goodness for the forward thinking of the English without which we'd have also been denied the \\"Harry Potter\\" series, destined to be the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" of the 21st Century!!!

B0031RAOVY|5.0|When I heard that our family movie for the evening was a \\"dog movie\\" with a \\"G\\" rating, I have to admit that I was less than enthusiastic and went into the experience with extremely low expectations.  I've got to hand it to Richard Gere for being involved in an extremely classy family movie that has something for everyone.  I found the movie to be well-done and quite enjoyable.  One thing that gives this show emotional punch is that it is based on a true story.  If the G-rating puts you off, don't let it.  If you are hesitant because it's a \\"dog movie\\" get over it.  This show is a real treat, and I'm glad I watched it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story line, the acting, it's watchability for people of all ages, and its message.<br /><br />MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AND THE BIGGEST SURPRISE OF THE WEEK FOR ME.
B000002534|5.0|I bought this album in the 70's and it's one of my favorite records.  Santana's playing is inspired.  It parallels his work with John McLaughlin.  But why is Promise of a Fisherman always neglected from Santana box sets and compilations?  I don't get it.  With his searing guitar and Stanley Clarke's awesome bass why in the world hasn't this track been digitally remastered?
B002UNMWAG|1.0|I never saw the first one, but I must say that I am compelled to write this review, because this movie really sucks. It has no character development, no coherent story line, and it carries on and on and on and on. I hope that I manage to damage the sales of item, because I think this movie embodies all that is wrong with our society as a whole. Enough of this garbage. How can something like this actually be out there? It sucks. Make me care, or don't make it.
1423119509|2.0|The books are a good read  and my son enjoys them.  HOWEVER it arrived damaged ...... the shipping box was in good shapte but the box holding the books looked like it had been thru a war....I would say that is an Amazon issue and not a shipping issue.  When I called they said if the shipping box wasn't damaged it was just toooo bad.......so I wont purchase from Amazon.

Her elegiacal prose is beautfully alive, fully capturing the exact zeitgeist of the those long ago years. What an honor to relive the joy and the sorrows of those days with these two budding young artists. Thank you, Patti, for taking me along with you through the trials and the tribulations you both faced!    I just didn't want this book to end.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|Although I am fond of his comedy since Ghostbusters and even before that, this movie is below average on comedy and not for the family to enjoy.   It could be compared to several of Kubriks movies, including Doctor Strangelove, for its bizar content and focus, but if your looking for a nice evening of comedy and enjoyment, this is probably not for you.
1577314808|5.0|For Me, the first several chapters make this one of  the best books I have ever read.  However, after a while ET sort of lets his Ego get out of control and starts theorizing and pontificating beyond Buddha and i think he might have lost it.  I am not proposing ET to be the new Messiah, a genius of original thought, or the creator of a new religion.  The PoN is a pragmatic rehash of Buddha principals which I find very secular and pragmatic.  Like many, I have toyed with, bought books, etc re Buddha principles and meditation etc.  After going through several of the bestselling books it just did not stick to my wall, so to speak.  This is where ET shines.  This is a very well written, easy to read pragmatic book, which I highly recommend to all, particularly the modern American Yuppie or other that feels harried by our fast paced lives, chauffeuring the kids from one event to the other, the BMW payments, a boss who should be in The Far Side and / or Dilbert and the rest of the modern pressures.  Buy it NOW; you won't be able to put it down, although you are supposed to chronically to contemplate the principles.  It may not change the direction of your Ship by 90 degrees but may help you enough to make a meaningful short term and material long term difference.    Highly Recommended!

I skimmed through the text and found a few interesting subjects, but nothing really engaged me. If you're looking for well-researched and detailed industry happenings, this book is great. If you're looking for a coffee table book, this isn't it.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Up in the Air points to the morally dead world we live in and have lived in for years. It's corageous, stellar in the direction and acting departments, and far better than that terrible Bigelow film that won undeserved oscars.    Ingmar Bergman directed a film The Silence in 1963. This film was a diagnosis of Bergman's Sweden; Up In The Air is our Silence.
1416562605|3.0|Remember the \\"Angry Young Man\\"? Remember how he raved against the institution, took insurgence to new levels of passion, showed an alternative path (for better or for worse) to an entire generation of people? Adiga feels like that man. And his mission feels similar. I can't remember the last time I have read such an angry voice in an Indian author. Actually, maybe I have never read such an angry voice. Indian authors have approached the shortfalls and sufferings of India and its denizens from many angles over the ages, but there's been nothing so \\"in the face\\". Adiga doesn't mince words - he refers to the protagonist's \\"homeland\\" as the Darkness. Period. He uses brutal language, brutal actions. Characters in his book don't shy from speaking or doing the dirty or gross, and in the process, play out a very accurate representation of some \\"parts\\" of India. Does Adiga go a little over-the-top in the process, especially by presenting a one-sided, unbalanced view of India as a whole - sure he does, but he has the licence to do that, and in fact, needs to take this approach to give the reader that \\"sock in the stomach\\" and \\"wake the ____  up\\" sort of call.     A couple of lines outlining the story before going on with my opinion: in a nutshell, it's the story of the \\"two Indias\\", demonstrated through the journey, the choices, and the transgressions of one \\"Balram Halwai\\" - the oppressed, poor man living in the Darkness, and the foreign-returned, rich, big city boy who employs him as a chauffeur. The overarching theme of the book is the vast gulf between India's haves and have-nots, a real and pressing danger today.    I feel ambiguously about this book. I loved the start - it was positively explosive and a wake-up call. But then, gradually, it became painful. Referring to the oppressed homeland as the Darkness a few times is ok, but when the word is used hundreds of times, it loses its efficacy and even becomes somewhat irritating. And this is in general true of the wholebook - the author just did not know where to stop. To be honest, while I appreciate the angry style, I much prefer the gorgeous subtlety of books like Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" to convey similar messages.    Summarily, I think this is worth a read, if for nothing else, because of its radically different approach from the vast majority of Indian authors. Don't expect the world, and you'll do just fine with this book.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|The book can easily be divided into 3 parts: slow, fast and back to the future. Be patient while you read the 1st 3rd of the novel as events tend to be unfolding so slowly and they are not easily linked. Then, almost suddenly, the pace accelerates so fast you are practically breathless (and sleepless). Then it slows down to end with a feel good ending that ties the story to the (slow) beginings. At the end, it all makes sense and starts to feel coherent. It leaves you wanting (wishing?) that the heroine will return.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Many times whilst watching this movie, I found myself wishing I was watching the much better 'Anne of the 1000 Days'. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is a travesty of a movie.     Scarlett Johansen seemed to have the acting range of a cold, dead fish. Natalie Portman did better, but frankly, she was fighting a losing battle against very poor scripting. And Eric Bana...well, as an Aussie, I have of course taken the oath of allegience to always adore Eric Bana, who like Hugh Jackman is one of the nicest guys you could hope to meet. But Eric has a very strong accent, of the type that many people who hail from Melbourne's northern suburbs do, and he just can't seem to hide it, no matter what. When he tries to sound English, it just makes me cringe. I was almost expecting King Henry VIII to crack open a beer, throw another shrimp on the barbie and call Anne 'a beaut sheila'. Ugh! Sorry, Eric, you're a top bloke, but I can say with all honesty that Amy Winehouse would have made a better King of England, even with the problem of trying to get a crown on over the wig.    The film made me angry because it was so historically inaccurate. No film better deserved to have the 'This movie is a work of fiction and bears no resemblance to any persons or events ever etc.' disclaimer appear in its closing credits. Worse, I sensed a strong bias from the writer (the writer of the book this was based on, assumedly), in that she seemed to be living vicariously through the character of Mary, and wanted her to be all things good, whilst her sister Anne had to appear as all things bad, assumedly to make Mary appear even better by comparison.    And as for the scene with Anne and her brother (and anyone who's seen the movie will know exactly what scene I mean), well, that was just ICKY!    I like my historical dramas to have at least some resemblance to actual history. And I like them to seem realistic and believable, not just like soap operas or bad romance novels, with inane dialogue and two-dimensional, illogically-constructed characters. I mean, in this movie, King Henry VIII is a thin, fairly stupid, silent and moody bloke who can be manipulated by the most transparent of women's wiles, who makes decisions on the merest hint of a whim, without a real thought of his own in his pretty little head. If King Henry VIII had been as much of a moron in real life as he was scripted to be in this movie, I doubt he would have survived beyond the cradle, let alone to become one of the most powerful, notorious, world-changing kings in history.    Oh, and one final thing -- if you're going to spend nearly half a movie boring us viewers by showing women in bed either in labour or miscarrying, at least get the details right. Elizabeth was a redhead, yet for some reason, the baby playing her at her birth had BLACK hair!
B002XHN776|2.0|I was very disappointed in this CD.  Normally 30 Seconds to Mars is a surefire can't lose band.  I'm not sure however what they were thinking with this one.<br /><br />The first one had a kind of a spaced out feel to it, which was very cool.  The second one toned that down some, but still had just that certain feel to it.<br /><br />This one went in a completely different direction, and I'm not sure what they were trying to do with it nor did I like it.<br /><br />The kids signing in the background reminded me a lot of Gerard McMann's  \\"Cry Little Sister\\" from the Lost Boys soundtrack.  A great song, and interesting to put in, but not something I expected from TSTM, especially in almost every song.<br /><br />Too much soft stuff, or happy songs, not enough rock.<br /><br />I'm hoping this was just their \\"Tiny music from the vatican gift shop\\", and the next CD they put out is more like their first and second one.

1892005034|5.0|Many people practice the compassionate communication described in this book by Marshall Rosenberg. People gather in groups and work on stating their needs and feelings to each other. People do this because we are all conditioned culturally and religiously to deny our feelings and needs and then talk at each other out of those adpative denials and what we wind up doing is having conflict.    We don't want to be emotionally vulnerable and we don't want to admit we have needs. So we posture, pretend, rationalize, idealize, romanticize and spend our lives missing the point of being humans. Together. So how does this work? Why does this work? I'd say the keystone of it for me is that we cannot really truly have compassion for another unless we have it for ourself. We cannot have it for ourself if we are denying our feelings and needs. If we don't even know that our feelings are connected to our needs and we don't even know that's life and truth. All our neurotic adaptations that lead us to argue, condemn, judge, accuse and waste life trying to be right to an imaginary audience in our narcissistic mind's eye (sounds like I've been there) are a complete waste of the gift of being.    So thank you Marshall and I've got the feelings and needs lists printed out and some people in the family are going to give it a try when we gather. Instead of our usual verbal abuse and denial, we'll just give it a try. It's probably going to be comically inept at first.

B001CZJKS0|4.0|I cannot comment on this set as the one I got in New Zealand had the first 5 Halloween movies in it.I brought The Curse Of Michael Myers seperate from Amazon to complete the set.The other two H20 and Resurrection I already had.The first is a landmark film which has been copied a lot from the late 70's right up to todays films.Watching it recently I am wondering what all the fuss was about , it does seem rather lame now but still a good film.Halloween 2 starts off where the first one finished , I probably enjoyed that more than the original.What were they thinking with Halloween Season Of The Witch , that film has nothing to do with the series yet they slapped a Halloween tag on it- must be cashing in on the name with that one.The other two you kind of wonder where they were heading with the series.A little girl ends up taking over from Michael and that crazy druid connection thing I found laughable.H20 I did enjoy as they were heading more back to the roots with Jamie Lee in it. The writers did not tie up some of the storylines from those earlier films with this one though, I suppose they thought the younger generation would not have seen those films and who cares anyway.I did enjoy Resurrection and saw the new Halloween which was ok but they really have to shelve this series now as they have gone on a bit long now.
B00275EGX8|3.0|I was beginning to hold out some hope (however little) that the Oscars might have been steering away from political correctness and social appeasement when, last year, [[ASIN:B001P9KR94 Slumdog Millionaire]] took home 8 of the 10 categories it was nominated in, including Best Picture. A \\"feel-good\\" movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.<br /><br />I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be \\"significant\\" and \\"modern\\" by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films as [[ASIN:B002T9H2L0 Inglourious Basterds]]? [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9]]? [[ASIN:B00337KMAA Up in the Air]]? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner ([[ASIN:B000VDDWEM 28 Weeks Later]]) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.<br /><br />From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is \\"the film to watch\\" and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or -- one that didn't even get mentioned -- [[ASIN:B002T9H2ME Moon]].<br /><br />Let's hit on the Best Director item...<br /><br />No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.<br /><br />I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.<br /><br />For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009.

0061914177|4.0|This is worth the small sum you spend on the book and gives practical advice on how to create awareness for yourself online.  Gives some lists and a few other options, but is short on detail. Won't show you what to do, but tells you how to do it.  A little difference. Its a skimpy book at 120 pages or so though, so a good reference guide if online business is your thing.  Its just not loaded with detail and there is the obligatory backstory that any book has on its author which amounts to filler...considering 120 pages, filler added to that, and content is a little thin. I'd still recommend it, but it will be obsolete in a year or two due to the changing face of the net.

0618526412|4.0|My first impression of McCullers' The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was amazement: amazement that a twenty-three year old woman had both the life experience and writing skills to craft such a book. In terse, no nonsense sentences McCullers tells a haunting story of friendships strange and unlikely. The story opens with the relationship between the deaf mute, John Singer and his mute friend Spiros Antonapoulus. Their handicaps seem to be the only thing they have in common. Spiros is a slow-witted fellow much like Lennie in Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men; Singer is a compassionate loner who takes Spiros into his care and even though the two are separated, remains devoted to his friend until the end. Whether it is Singer's compassionate nature or the fact that in spite of his handicap he appears to understand and empathize with others, he acquires a following of damaged and wounded souls: young Mick Kelly (perhaps the author herself) who loves music and aspires to compose and play the piano; Jake Blount whose political idealism drives him to berserk rants; the Negro doctor Benedict Mady Copeland equally idealistic and crazed about leading his \\"people\\" out of ignorance and poverty and sacrifices his health in doing so; and Biff Brannon, owner of the New York Cafe and widower whose own loneliness is eased by the presence of the deaf mute. Singer becomes a sort of kingpin in these characters' lives and satisfies a hungry need in each. When Singer abruptly leaves the story in the manner of E. A. Robinson's Richard Cory, his four disciples are devastated and cast helplessly upon the winds of their own lives.    There is something about the South that makes its authors twist stories and characters to the bizarre. In The Heart is a Lonely Hunter McCullers' tale is steeped in this gothic darkness: Bubber's accidental shooting of Baby Wilson; Copeland's son Willie loses his \\"feets\\" to amputation, the effect of cruel and inhumane treatment by his white jailors. McCullers' South is the South of Flannery O'Connor and Tennessee Williams. But because we are human and once young, we are moved to pathos by young Mick Kelly's two rooms: her \\"inside\\" room where she holds her dreams in safe keeping, a room that only Singer is allowed to enter and her \\"outside\\" room, which is life, its ugliness, disappointments and dashed hopes. As the door shuts on Mick's inside room, we mourn for her. And we mourn for ourselves.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This has to be one of the best, if not the best, war series ever made. The interviews with the soldiers helps us younger generation get closer to understanding what these men went through during WW2 and what they sacrificed for all of us. I salute all of the men and women that have served in the military and fought for us.    Following the men from training to the end of the war makes you feel more for them and what they went through. The flow of each episode is excellent and keeps you well entertained.    The video and audio quality is excellent for the Blu-ray version. It includes 5 discs for the series, two episodes on each disc, and a sixth disc with a documentary called \\"We Stand Alone Together: The Men of Easy Company.\\"
B001EN71DG|5.0|Of course the material is near and dear to so many of our hearts. It has become something we went from loving in the theater, to playing with on our living room floor, to sharing with our children. Now a whole new generation can enjoy these movies which I dare call classics. For too long I had to watch them on VHS. Now with this collection I get the \\"best of both worlds\\" in DVD quality. The original movies as presented in the theater I loved so dearly in my youth, and the version that were re-envisioned by Mr. Lucas many years later. Some dislike the newer \\"enhanced\\" versions. This collection let's you have it either way and for a price that is affordable.    Sound and video quality are excellent, truly a great product.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|I`ve read the source material, and the Holmes depicted in this film measures up very well.<br /><br />What is throwing some people is that whereas Doyle served up Holmes` personal particulars in small sporadic doses; this film delivers them all in one shot, and it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />Nonetheless, all the elements of the character seen here are evident in the original stories.<br /><br /> Give credit where it is due; this Holmes is ALWAYS THINKING, and that is the hallmark of the character. Even when he is fighting, it is an intellectual exercise to him.<br /><br />Just as in the Granada Television series; the Watson herein is the competant, intelligent and reliable friend that he should be...(Gone forever I hope, is the bumbling idiot that Watson became in the Rathbone/Bruce movies)<br /><br />While there is no Jeremy Brett here, Robert Downey Jr. clearly put solid effort into his Sherlock, and while his depiction is a more gritty, 'warts and all' Holmes, I actually found the foibles and failures to be refreshing. Again, Doyles` Holmes was not perfect as anything other than a detective, so it`s all within the scope of the character. There is a risque` scene that has Holmes gulled and placed in a particularly foolish and vulnerable position, and that no doubt puts off the Holmes Purists as an insult to the character. I won`t argue that it is pandering to the prurient-minded... but I also say that it hardly ruins the rest of the film.<br /><br />Finally; Doyle did not create Sherlock Holmes as an intellectual exercise, he created him as entertainment, and this film is entertaining.<br /><br />I`ll be just fine with adding this Sherlock to my Holmes collection.

Of course \\"Hangar 18\\" features the acclaimed solo trade off between Mustaine and guitar virtuoso Marty Friedman.  This is the Megadeth album that all others are measured against.  With this album Megadeth proved who was leading the pack, when this was released the big four of thrash collectively winced knowing that none of them could ever top this.

144867185X|4.0|This is a classic book.  However, the too many typos look like they resulted from scanning in the text and then not proof reading - the publisher does a diservice to the book.

B002SF9YUM|3.0|I knew nothing of this story, and was still entertained.  I had to watch it a second time because the Spanish actors accents were all so heavy that I missed dialog. I love art but I've never understood any of Dali's paintings. If any part of this story is true then it explains some of his work, he was a a manic depressive ego maniac.
0452289963|5.0|I have read many books about the ego and how one needs to let go of it for inner peace and to awaken to one's inner consciousness.  A New Earth, for me, really expressed this concept in an easy to understand and graspable way.  Even though many of the concepts discussed were not \\"new\\", they were expressed in such a way that i finally understand them on a deeper level where I can incorporate them into my daily life. This was a great read for me at this point in my life and it may be for many others as well.
0307463745|4.0|One of my biggest gripes about the early reviews to come out about Rework is that they had no substance. Words like \\"inspirational\\", \\"brilliant\\", and \\"rethink\\" generally trigger my BS alarm, so I really didn't know what to expect with Rework. I've been reading Signal vs. Noise, the design and usability blog by 37signals, for a few years now, and I've had plenty of time to become acquainted with Jason and David's style. That I even refer to them by their first names should clue you in to their style. They come across in writing as they do in their live webcasts and presentations: familiar. Point is, I've been irked by the longest by those vapid early reviews to come out. They meant nothing to me. Hopefully you'll find this review more much helpful for determining whether or not Rework is worth your time.    TL;DR Version: Buy the book if you have no idea what 37signals stands for. If you do, expect SvN on paper.    Long Version: If you've never heard of 37signals or read Signal vs. Noise and you're a business owner or someone who needs to buy a book for an \\"entrepreneur\\" (Jason and David prefer the term \\"starter\\"), then this is a pretty good book to purchase. It's 273 pages, but most of that is filled with white space and somewhat relevant artwork (almost too much artwork, really), so it's an easy read. From start to finish I spent just over a few hours reading Rework, and I'm no speed reader by any stretch of the imagination. Don't expect to be blown away by any revolutionary ideas, either. One of the early reviews to come out said, \\"The clarity, even genius, of this book actually brought me to near-tears on several occasions\\" (Tom Peters, New York Times bestselling author). I don't want to bad mouth the guy, because I don't know him, but that's some wicked crazy rad hyperbole. This is a simple book that's just a by-product of the blog. Nothing more, nothing less.    If you are someone who is very familiar with 37signals and has spent a considerable amount of time reading the blog, then don't feel like you need to pick up this book immediately. Don't get me wrong, $12 (or however much it costs when you buy Rework) is entirely worth it, if even just to have some good night time reading material. But if you think that Rework will bring you any additional insight into 37signals beyond what is available online, then you are thinking incorrectly. Rework felt like a package of SvN blog posts from 2007 to 2009. I'll explain why in a bit.    The Major Takeaways:    If you're strapped for cash and still want to take away lessons from this book, just read the table of contents and then cross-reference those words with the 37signals blog. Jason and David do a heck of a job being straightforward about what they are writing about. For example, \\"Ignore the real world\\" (page 13) can be found on their website. In fact, a whole bunch of their content from Rework can be found on their website. To wit:    \\"Learning from mistakes is overrated\\" (Rework, page 16): \\"Learning from failure is overrated\\" (Feb. 3rd, 2009)(SvN)  \\"Planning is Guessing\\" (Rework, page 19): \\"The Planning Falacy\\" (Jun. 12th, 2009) (SvN)  \\"Workaholism\\" (Rework, page 25): \\"Fire the workaholics\\" (Mar. 7th, 2008) (SvN)  \\"Enough with 'Entrepreneurs'\\" (Rework, page 28): \\"The word entrepreneur and its baggage\\" (Apr. 22nd, 2009) (SvN)  \\"Scratch your own itch\\" (Rework, page 34): \\"What's your problem?\\" (Getting Real)  \\"No time is no excuse\\" (Rework, page 40): \\"There's always time to launch your dream\\" (Mar. 10, 2009) (SvN)  \\"Outside Money is Plan Z\\" (Rework, page 50): \\"Fund yourself\\" (Getting Real)      And that's just the first 50 pages! You see where I'm going with this. If you are an avid reader of 37signals and have kept up with them for 6-12 months, then most of what you read in Rework will simply be a regurgitation of what's already been written online. That's why the early reviews really irked me. Is this book insightful? Clearly. Is it legendary or tear-worthy? Give me a break!The grand language is really making me distrust books, and if I didn't already know the great work that 37signals does or if I were not already a long time customer with 37signals, I wouldn't have bought this book. The flowery language of the early reviews just made me expect the world from Rework, and all I really got was the hardcover form of Signal v. Noise, with better edits and word choice.    I wouldn't write this long, rambling review if I wasn't passionate about the line of work that 37signals is in. I owe much of my organization and peace of mind to 37signals products, so count me as one of the 37signals \\"audience\\" members. I think Rework is an exceptional book in that it serves as a reminder of many of the lessons and \\"recipes\\" that Jason and David have given us through the years. It is definitely worth the money if you have not already internalized much of the lessons contained in the Rework table of contents. If you have, and you are an avid fan of Jason and David already, then there's really no need to read Rework unless you have some extra time on your hands.     And to Jason and David, if either of you actually read this review, then I hope in your next book you'll ditch the early BS reviews. That's my main gripe. If you want to recycle SvN from 2009-2011 and turn it into a book called ENHANCE! in 2012, that's fine by me. I'll be the first one in line to read it; but know that I, and many other readers, will expect to see the same stuff that we've already read on the blog. I love the work you two do; I mean I REALLY love the work that you two do. But come on. Don't set me up for the stars and then throw glitter in my face.    All in all I give Rework a 7/10. It's worth a read if you have no clue what 37signals stands for. Even if you do, buy the book for a friend or out-of-touch boss.
B000002J1S|5.0|\\"If you think that it's pretentious, you've been taken for a ride\\" PG<br /><br />In 1974 Genesis peaked with the release of THE LAMB (their Revelation you could say). Over 35 years later it is still not only listenable, but interesting, unpredictable and fresh sounding and still musically challenging. What other rock-opera/concept album can you say that of? (only Zappa's, WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY from almost a decade earlier).<br /><br />THE LAMB is an album/concept/achievement of mythic proportions. For how dysfunctional the recording process was supposed to have been, the result is an amazingly successful synthesis of 5 musical talents at their peak. And what they produced, while directly connected to their earlier sound (traced through the progressively improving TRESPASS, NURSERY CRYME, FOXTROT & SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND), was also different by a quantum leap. How could Genesis continue as a band after such an achievement? They didn't. Gabriel went on to explore his 'Electric Shaman' persona in an even more down to earth, less introverted way, and the rest of the band turned to churning out increasingly superficial (and successful) pretty pop hits.<br /><br />In '74 when this was first released my local FM station played the whole double album in it's entirety. I was an aspiring young Genesis fan then and when I stayed up late to record it, I wasn't sure how to digest the new sound or concepts. I didn't understand it all. It was clearly going to be an acquired taste, something I had to grow into. Years later after it was burned into my mind it became in some weird way my first religion - before I found something more substantial. And yet THE LAMB is still clearly a valid, grand, mythic morality play, incorporating sounds that both root us to Earth and Cosmos..., with words and concepts that unite Greek myth, English romantic literature, psychic archetypes and psychedelic music. It is in essence a story of, and guide to, adolescent male rite-of-passage initiation ritual. You could say The Who's TOMMY did this first, but being more complex, poetic and complete, THE LAMB has endured better.<br /><br />What resulted was the band's swansong, but each individual was distinct and unique and vital. Peter Gabriel was clearly inspired for this production, taking a lead creative role. His voice is strong, confident and flexible and his lyrics a string of inventive, sometimes profound and often witty one-liners. Phil Collins gives solid powerfully nimble drumming, as well as excellent backing vocals (a role he was always best suited for). Michael Rutherford's bass is a force of nature, crunching and churning along like the inexorable shift of tectonic plates (augmented by that deep and simple bass pedal). Tony Banks is all over the place tying it together with sustaining keyboards played with supreme, dexterous confidence. And then there is Steve Hackett, with a guitar sound and understated vibe that comes and goes like the plaintive song of a humpback whale in the deep, never flashy, always tasteful. And this is the rare accomplishment of this recording - a psychedelic classic that takes you on a trip (in whatever condition you begin in), to expand and challenge and reunite but in an accessible, never creepy or harsh way (like The Grateful Dead, or Pink Floyd could do). From the opening alienated Broadway street scene to the exalted final resolution of It, the album flows in one continuous blended series of sounds (made of a variety of catchy 4-5 minute songs tied together by the those incredible segues...)<br /><br />Like many of these reviews, this one is long on words and high on praise. For many years I thought I'd put this album with it's adolescent associations and apparent pretensions behind me. But listening to it now as an 'old fart', I see how formative (and transformative) it was. I'm glad to have met and absorbed and been changed by it, and to have moved on, out of the depths and into the ongoing vastness of It.This sounds like a lot to expect from a rock band and album, but it's true.a rock band and album, but it's true.
B00063MBU8|4.0|First I ought to mention that I am not the target audience.  I bought this for one of my kids.  But when loading it to iTunes, I listened to it and it has a lot of fun tunes about how phony the world is and how girl friends can be uncaring.  The same stuff that has been fueling pop music for as long as I can remember, but this is definiately listenable.  I heard some of the pieces on Youtube, check that out.    My only concern is a technical one.  The disk is a \\"dual disk\\", it has a CD on one side and a DVD on the other.  It is a bit thicker (roughly 2X) than standard because of that.  It took two discs to find one that my computer's CD drive could read, and even then my computer's DVD/CD drive (which almost always works) could not read the CD side.  It would read the DVD side OK.  The symptoms of the problem were that the time to read the CD were somewhat longer than the length of the song was supposed to be, and the stored music had static.

B000026258|5.0|I've been a big fan of the original electronic groups Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, among others, since the 70s, and it amazes me that almost none of their fans never mention this Reich masterpiece. Most of this 57-minute composition sounds like it was done on electronic keyboards, but with so much more life and soul.<br /><br />That is of course because it's all played by people, and thus has that warm, live, perfectly imperfect feel that only live homo saps can provide. And beyond the wonderful feel of the sounds, the composition itself is a multi-layered gem that challenges yet also lulls and soothes the listener while never straying into cheesy New Agey territory. Reich is on a musical mission here, and fulfills it perfectly.<br /><br />Listening to this from start to finish, especially on a really fine pair of headphones or an audiophile system with the lights out (I love hearing it in the bathtub), is a tranquil yet bracing experience that never fails to delight. It seems to combine much of what I love about the best parts of the minimalist and electro genres into a seamless whole, and leaves me with the happily complete sensation one gets after hearing a very fine symphony.<br /><br />The female voices add the crowning touch, bringing that lush warmth that only the human voice can (to our ears, at least...I wonder how other animals feel about it?). Along with a few of Glass' pieces, this is about the only minimalist stuff I listen to on any sort of regular basis. It's a very satisfying work of music, and this version seems to my ears the warmest and most \\"perfect\\" of the three extant.<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of music who's willing to listen outside the box.

0066620996|5.0|This book came as a result of some very data-intensive research by Jim Collins' research team. After analyzing thousands of companies, they picked one dozen that seemed to make a sustained jump from a history of \\"good\\" performance to one of \\"great\\" performance. They found that in all cases but one, there was no external charismatic CEO, but rather a quiet, unassuming leader who caused the change to occur by an intense focus and discipline on measuring the core business.<br /><br />I passed this along to an newly relocated executive, as it is an outstanding read for any executive transitioning into a new organization.

0316017922|5.0|This book contends success is not merely a product of intelligence and hard work alone. Contrary to the solid American myth, chance and culture play critical roles in making people successful. The first two factors: IQ and effort are mandatory, but the second two: chance and culture are also crucial to producing success. Gladwell posits a \\"10,000-Hour Rule\\" in any field of endeavor to become an expert, along with a reasonably strong IQ. However, cultural norms, ethnic backgrounds, economic markets and other (often random factors) were instrumental in the successes of Beatles, Bill Gates, Korean pilots, and inner-city school children.<br /><br />The take-away is an awareness of your circumstance, not just your effort and IQ, as a critical factor in your success. Readers of this book should take a hard look at the natural advantages the world is offering to help them become successful.

1439190275|5.0|This book speaks to the science behind the controlled carbohydrate eating and explains further about not being a heavy protein diet as the media has you falsely believe, but rather it is eliminated refined unhealthy carbs and limiting natural carbs while losing weight only to incorporate back in all healthy carbs once you're at your goal weight. When you follow atkins you are not limited in food choices, your menu is extensive and you are satiated all day.   People wrongly associate Akins with the Induction phase when this is only one phase of the diet and not long lasting. The true diet is a lifelong change incorporating healthy eating. They now have more than 4 decades of research material completed, hence the newest book outlining the latest information. What's not to love?
1556347308|4.0|The GURPS system is perhaps my favorite in all RPGs since its so comprehensive and versatile, yet everything comes fairly intuitively. With GURPS, you can adapt the rules in such a way to fit any setting, be it hack and slash fantasy or superhero mayhem or cyberpunk thriller. It isn't as innovative as systems such as Fate, but regardless, it is comprehensive enough to satisfy any roleplayer who wants a realistic experience. Also, characters are made from points not levels, so unlike DnD where higher level == higher combat prowess, a higher point total means you can spend the points on whatever you want. This unfortunately makes it a little more difficult for the GM, but not overly much.  The one bad thing about the product physically is the binding, the first copy that I ordered had fallen entirely out of its binding and I've heard reports of editions falling apart within a few weeks, so maybe pick up the PDF from [...]

B002SJIO5E|5.0|To start, I never read reviews before I see a film because I want to approach it with unbiased eyes the first time I see it. I never got a chance to see this one last year and when I caught a clip of Wickus throwing the cat food as a \\"distraction\\" well, I just had to see this movie.     I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome this movie was. I didn't really have high hopes for it going in, because from what I had seen it looked low budg and silly, but boy was I wrong! I enjoyed this much more than AVATARD (which I found myself constantly rolling my eyes at the cheesy dialogue and cliche storyline). This is much more entertaining the TURD LOCKER which was about as exciting as watching cheese grow mold.     Why did I like this movie? Here are a few reasons:    1) Amazing special effects. Very believable CGI with few hiccups.   2) It was funny (at least in the beginning. Then it gets serious later. I think the tongue-in cheek aspect works very well for introducing you into this film, though it is hard to sustain an entire story that way. That is why I think they changed to a more serious tone later.)  3) Cool alien guns. Ok, it's pretty primal but, WOW, their were some awesome guns!  4) The most amazing mech ever seen in film. I really was so enthralled with it, and they better bring back more in the sequel.  5) Entertaining from start to finish. I literally could not take my eyes off the screen. I found myself missing things if I did. Something interesting is always going on, not to mention the story pulls you the whole way through.  6) Original. Okay, how many alien invasion/ visitor or variants there of have there been? It's a sci-fi staple. To come to the table with something fresh and watchable in this arena is commendable indeed.  7) I actually cared about the outcome. I found myself rooting for the aliens at the end. Compare this to AVATARD where I didn't give one billy-goats fart how things ended because I already knew what was going to happen. And the Na'viwere lame anyway. Some people say that AVATARD is just ripping off Dances with Wolves. That's not the problem. The problem is it doesn't do it well. District nine 1takes basically the same idea but succeeds. Why? Because the guy is being inducted into the alien culture against his will! A great take on the premise that works for me.      The only real thing wrong with the movie, IMO, is the change from goofy, tongue-in-cheek sci-fi flick to over-serious action-drama. I can understand why they did it, and for the most part it works, but it was a little confusing as to whether they were being serious or not. I think the movie started to take it self too seriously and should have stuck more with the tone in the beginning. Still an awesome movie though.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book has NO comparison to Harry Potter even though the story line seems too similar.  There were a few chapters that I felt were too far fetched but it was enjoyable. I felt like the story lacked detail and was rushed too soon leaving the reader with a less then close connection with the main characters.  I wish the beginning plot line would have been more informative so that the characters would be easier to connect with.  I will continue to read the other books in the series.
0446567329|5.0|Good book but not all it was hyped up to be. Purchase was great though. This book was going for almost $20 at our local bookstore and I got here for like $7 and it was brand new and in great condition. Just ordered some more...
B002NOAF9W|5.0|If you are a Stones fan and don't have this in your collection, your not a Stones fan. First off I think this is one of the finest live albums ever and to be able to hear more of it is incredable. The added bonus of the rest of the show is so fantastic. This is a great product and one to be cherished. The sound is beautiful, The Stones captured at their very best and in the best time of their career to that point. They were on top of the mountain. The whole box set is a collectors dream. I suggest going into a dark room putting on the cd's closing your eyes and you\\"ll swear you were there.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Here is a movie that took a while for me to get around to watching due to some comments about how 'boring the first half is' but I can honestly say I found District 9 very entertaining from START to finish.    Furthermore,how a movie like 'Hurt locker' (which I thought was just ok) recieved such acclaim (well,by some,the noisy,dollar empowered few I'll wager) and District 9 seemed to (unfairly imo) go without recognition is another reminder of who controls the dollar.    So,District 9 for me is a movie that has good story,a convincing and very well acted lead (along with good supporting cast),good scripting,excellent visuals (note in 1:85,not 2:35 so no letterboxing for the majority of us widescreen TV owners).(The picture from start to finish was excellent quality - no blurry scenes mixed with some grainy scenes then some pristine scenes,just consistent demo material).  Also the HD sound track was excellent and topped off this HD gem.    Furthermore,on top of some of the racial statements this movie presents (not in a pro negative perspective imo) it also goes into deeper territory with a few not so unobvious messages that tie in with the book of revelation from the Bible.(Mark of the beast for example for the impatient/curious).    An easy recommend from me especially for the HD sci/fi lover.

B00005R62N|4.0|This was the first album that really lead to the bands commercial breakthrough. With alot of attention following the bands newest studio effort Killing Machine/Hell Bent For Leather. The genre was creeping up as AC/DC's Highway To Hell and Motorhead's Ace Of Spades was just around the corner. Priest issued their first live album Unleashed In The East, recorded from shows in Japan. No better way to capitalize on the rise to success than a live album with your best material. And thats what UITE is. With their 70's gems like Sinner, Genocide, Exciter, Tyrant, Diamonds And Rust and a more heavier version of Victims Of Changes (which is the version most people are aware of) this album was a sampling (only 9 tracks) of what a powerhouse live band Priest was. Interestingly though, only 2 tracks from the bands recent album Killing Machine were featured: The Green Manalishi and Running Wild. The remastered edition is the one to get for sure as it contains bonus songs that werent included on the original. These include Rock Forever, Delivering The Goods, Hell Bent For Leather, and Starbreaker. The first three were tracks off Killing Machine/Hell Bent. Obviously they wanted to rectify the situation as mentioned above. While everything here is great, no fan is unaware of what a great powerful and brutal delivery these live versions are, its a shame the band couldnt release the full show in its original running order with the bonus cuts intact with the original record to reflect the concept of being at the concert. And it is also common fact there were 4 other songs done on this tour, Beyond The Realms Of Death, White Heat Red Hot, Take On The World, and Evil Fantasies (from Hell Bent). All four songs at one point or another were issued on EP's in the 80's so, why they werent included with the 4 other bonus cuts is strange. If anything Realms needed to be included as its definetly a classic 70's Priest song. Still, the updated 13 song album is good enough, and of course with orwithout the controversey of overdubbing that this album carries quite a lot of, its a musthave, an historical live heavy rock album and the final foot in the door the band needed to prepare audiances for their domination with British Steel a year later.

B002PLALCO|5.0|I have been a pink fan for years, i got the dvd a few days ago.  I love the stage the songs and this dvd is breathtaking.  Pink is such an underated artist, i don't think she gets the credit she deserves. Pink pushes the envelope, and she does it with great success. i wish i could have have seen this show in person.  simply awesome, breathtaking and fun to watch.  Loved it

B002UNMW7O|2.0|'Boondock Saints' was a massive sleeper in 2001. It was campy, raw, gritty, over-the-top, violent, funny and action-packed. Great script, great chemistry, great directing, some very memorable one-liners and a kick-ass finale! The movie never took itself seriously. Easily worth multiple watches. A cult film and an underground favorite for all the right reasons.     What I was hoping for was more of what I typed up top. What I, and fans of the original got instead, is a mish-mash of poor acting, watered-down chemistry, a bad script, an uneven pace of the film and a general lack of direction. It was as if all the returning actors thought they could just sleepwalk their way through this movie and the new additions thought they could try and fit in as replacements for two outstanding characters from the original. It was all disjointed and any momentum the movie seemed to pick up was killed by Detectives Greenly, Duffy and Dolly and their poor attempts at trying to be funny cops. The ending with Billy Connolly and Peter Fonda is exceptional but not enough to save a film from taking itself too serious.     If there is to be a third film, and the ending leaves the door open for that possibility, I hope all involved watch both movies and find out where they went wrong with this sequel.     How Troy Duffy got away with this one confuses me. If there is a
B0011UBDTK|5.0|The process of buying these series of dvd's was ,fast,professional,every sigle detail was great.  Before I used Amazon,I had used other company and it was a nightmare.  I recommend Amazon ,to anyone is the best most effective and reliable way to purchase books or dvd,etc.

B00354Y9ZU|2.0|I think this book is highly over-rated.  I bought it after reading one of Seth Godin's shorter treatises \\"Brainwashed: Seven Ways to Reinvent Yourself,\\" which was refreshing and exciting to read, but alas, any hints that Godin might be on to something of substance, appear to be a mirage.  Godin's writing reminds me of Malcolm Gladwells, and it's probably no accident.  This guy wants to point out how the \\"world really works\\" and convince you to re-evaluate your place in the economy.  Not bad advice, in general. But his arguments are circular, and almost approach a psychological style spin on how to become an \\"indispensable\\" member of the workforce, to do \\"emotional work\\" and be an \\"artist\\".  However, besides finding the book an unsatisfying waste of $9.99 (Kindle Edition), I disagree with his entire premise that school teaches people to be \\"obedient cogs\\" and that one can simply follow Godin's advice and craft his or her own way into becoming an invaluable part of an organization.  Certain people grow into their success because of a combination of inherent traits (intelligence, talent, people skills), who they know, their education, and a lot of luck/circumstance.  Mr. Godin writes well, cogently and convincingly, but he's also a circular bore whose advice won't help you much, except perhaps to generate yuppy style coffee table discussions about the \\"new\\" economy.
0307408833|1.0|Disappointing. Expensive ingredients had to be thrown away because they just didn't taste good. And I am a gluten-free baker. This is not my first time (or 1000th time) baking with alternate flours and ingredients, but how many recipes do I need to try before I find one that works? I have 6 failures now, and feel that's enough.<br /><br />I'm more mad at Gwyneth Paltrow, who spoke so highly of Erin McKenna and her sexy cupcakes. I should have known that Gwyneth would never make cupcakes, even vegan gluten-free ones, because there's no way any home cook could make these dry tasteless cakes palatable, no matter how much frosting you put on.<br /><br />Cooking times are off, poor descriptions, I'm really upset. I also hard it find to believe that anyone would pay for \\"frosting shots\\" based on this recipe. I feel scammed. Not angry, just sad.
B002VJ0576|4.0|This was a great movie especially.  I was at first surprised then pleased that it was something different and unexpected.  I usually think of the old Basil Rathbone's version of Sherlock Holmes and think of stuffy acting on both his character as well as Doctor Watson but I was pleased that this was different.  The dinosaur took me aback but I did say \\"unexpected!\\"  Gareth David-Lloyd was brilliant and a great actor, the guy playing Sherlock had to grow on me.  Overall it isn't Masterpiece Theatre but a good exciting mystery romp!
0312360258|1.0|I have three words for this book: Elementary, Predictable, Boring. May I also add that I read this book because someone told me that it was a combination of Harry Potter and Twilight. I have read the complete series of both and was incredibly disappointed in Twilight but fell in love with Harry Potter. Either way, it, in no way, resembled Twilight. I think people said that because it had to do with vampires. Yet there were zero similarities to Twilight, aside from vampires, which can be linked to thousands of other books.There were some links here and there to Harry Potter. It took place at a school and had a bully (Aphrodite)...that's about the only link to Harry Potter. However, I think this book should be in children's fiction and not young adult based on the writing. There was more witchcraft than vampire activity. Really there wasn't any vampire activity except for the blood lust. Overall, very poor quality book and tons of spelling errors (always a turn-off). I'm going to move on to a real vampire books now (Anne Rice).
0385335997|2.0|After reading the first three books in the Outlander series, I have to say I am absolutely fed up with the whole thing with Jamie and Claire.  Nothing ever seems to resolve in their relationship.  It's always hanging by a thread.  This book in particular had a lot of repetition of minor details which is also annoying.  In my opinion it took way too long to describe a teeny bit of action.
031606792X|1.0|Let me start by saying I am incredibly disappointed by this book!  I have noticed that most people that like this series are teenagers or people who have not read much before this series, sadly. If they did, they would know good quality writing. I'm not surprised by my disappointment with her downward writing after Twilight. As the last book of the series and even thicker than the rest it lacked quality.    Nothing really happened as usual. It was predictable the next move she was going to make. I hate predictability. I just really do not enjoy Stephanie Meyer's writing. The only thing I enjoyed about the series that kept me connected was Edward and Bella's connection.    Yet, as like the other books, Meyer builds up for this great fight and NOTHING happens!!! Some parts that she builds up (like the sex \\"scene\\") was maybe three lines when it happened. I had to go back and say...\\"that was it?\\"     I will say that I liked Jacob more because of this book probably because his role was greater than that of Edward. Edward did pretty much nothing but comfort...boring. Though that is a sad thought because the sole thesis of the series is based on Edward and Bella's relationship.    She puts too much fluff into her books. I knew going into it that these books were meant for teens but after enjoying the first due to their relationship I had to give the rest a shot. Now I'm curious how teens even have the attention span to get through this book.    It was humorous when it shouldn't have been. Let me quote another review that said it perfectly.    \\"Overall: these are not GOOD books. These are ENTERTAINING books. You will laugh (mostly at things you aren't supposed to), you will knock yourself over the head with them wondering why you are even reading them, then you will keep reading because you cannot stop, they are so cracked out.\\"    I'm not sure how this ended up making it into the movies. Probably because the first book was actually pretty good. Yet, thinking about it...therest of the movies are guaranteed to be better than these books. For example, there was not one fight in all four of  these books. It was not discussed that Edward fought James in the first book. Meyer wouldn't dare involve some action for crying out loud. Yet, the movie showed them fighting, which made the movie better. So maybe the rest of the movies will change things around a bit and allow them to fight.     There are supposed to be sacrifices. It was too happily ever after. Bella gets everything plus some. She build it up for the possibility of casualties and not even a scratch.    Well, I'll leave it at that. It is no wonder it took me so long to finish this book. I feel bad selling the last to for $35.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|i saw Capitalism by Michael Moore and this movie really hit a nevre.    It's not just about Republicans or Democrats, it's about crooks on both sides of the issue. All are accountable in this current and ongoing financial mess.    From Hannity's God-Ronald Regan himself, to Clinton and W, this was a never ending cycle not so much of capitalism, but of greed overall.    Banks, Corporations, and money running this country. The Treasury department full of AIG people allowing fellow competition to fail while fattening their own pockets and that of their friends.    All are accountable. This movie really hits home when you see every day people being jived by the very people designed to take care of them. People loosing their homes and being thrown into the streets, one Congress-woman fired up with all the shenanigans going on while at the same time, leading Democrats are making back door deals with Bush and the Republican parties not for the betterment of the country, but for their own re-election.    The outcry became, do nothing, jobs are lost, economy collapses. So in their own personal survival greed, the Congress reached across the board and bailed the very banks who brought us to the brink of economic armageddon, only to see those banks payout their own bonuses before anything else.    In the true world of Capitalism, if you fail, you fail. Nobody bails out homeowners who lose their homes and are thrown into the street. Capitalism in reality is survival of the fittest, and yet here, when the Banks and mortgage companies failed, the Congress, not the people, bailed them out.      Moore's film is not only the best of his films i've ever seen, but it's also the most frustrating to watch knowing what happened.
B0006GWPXI|5.0|This diecast model is awesome, every single detail has been carefully reproduced. Obviously it opens the doors and hood, the tires are pretty nice (but the front ones are not steering controllable -from the interior- like other models). The pieces below the rear bumper are (very) delicate and confirms that this model is not intended for heavy users like children. Its a collectible item, not a toy.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Good family classic that never gets old. I really like how it has the blu ray and regular dvd all in one.
B000MG1YC0|5.0|I own all the Sirena albums, and I'm a fan of the genre.  That said, Nine Destinies and a Downfall is a great addition to any gothic metal collection.  \\"Sundown\\" alone is worth the price of admission, a shredder and a sweetness, rolled into one.  Yes, Sirenia have had vocalist transitions, yet Monica brings the sweetness to the female vocals to the band that they really needed IMO.  Other noteworthy tracks  from this release are \\"The Last Call\\", \\"My Mind's Eye\\", and \\"Absence Without Leave\\".    Make no mistake, this is not the growling Sirenia of yesteryear.  The male death-metal vocals are present in some songs yet used sparingly.  This has disappointed some fans, but it's a step in the right direction for the band.  The  moral of the story is that you don't need death-metal to be metal.    I've always thought Sirenia sounded a bit like and 80s hair band turned heavy metal, and the softening on Nine Destinies reminds me of that.  More than once I've though of this band as Debbie Gibson meets Slayer, but in the end it works.  Anyone in the Nightwish camp looking for more music should check this band out.  Nine Destinies is a great place to start.  5 stars.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Ok, unlike Ghost in the Shell 2.0 I actually liked the additions to Evangelion 1.11.  Eva looks better than ever thanks to a lot of reworked scenes and additions (love the new look of the 5th Angel).  A thing I noticed about Japanese rebuilds, similar to the Complete version of Advent Children this reworking of Evangelion makes more sense of the story.  It seems that we will learn more about Seele and the Human Instrumentality Project in this version than we did in the original series.  Looking forward to 2.0, 3.0, and Final!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Orchestral accompaniment to rock, as the amazon review suggests, usually results in more misses than hits.  One of my great disappointments was that the music of the Moody Blues, which you might think would be ideally suited for orchestral accompaniment, sounded only more maudlin with a 40-piece orchestra. Orchestral Yes didn't match expectations. The only examples I know of that really worked were Procol Harum Live with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and two albums by a somewhat obscure british prog rock group, Renaissance - Turn of the Cards, and Sheherazade.      So my expectations were low when I put on Metallica S&M, especially given that heavy metal seemed like it would be far less conducive to a good orchestral collaboration than the aforementioned prog rock bands.  Surprise!!! It works.  Certainly not on every song, but there are enough cuts that benefit from orchestral layering to reward repeat listening.  Standouts include \\"No Clover Leaf,\\" \\"One,\\" and \\"Enter Sandman.\\"     However, what really makes this compilation a truly unique find are just two songs: \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"Outlaw Torn.\\"  On these two gems, the power of rock and the artistry of the orchestra come together to create a musical ecstasy that is damn near orgasmic.  You just want to put these songs on, turn up the volume, grab your favorite beer, and let the music wash over you through every pore of your body.    I bought this CD about 8 years ago and it has withstood the test of time.  For me, this version of \\"Outlaw torn\\" is the most powerful 8 minutes of music ever recorded on this planet.
B0035G9ABG|5.0|To a casual Gorillaz listener that only likes the singles that have come from the animated group, Plastic Beach is probably not for you. But for those of us that listen to all the albums straight through, and appreciate the talent that is displayed in the songwriting, then you will adore Plastic Beach.<br /><br />  Every song on this album has a flow to it, while some are not the best or have a tremendous draw, they will all continue to be played in your library for years to come. Some of the songs on Plastic Beach are that kind of special that will forever be on your most played play-list. Empire Ants, Broken, Some Kind of Nature, and Melancholy Hill are four that really stand out. Those songs exemplify everything that makes the Gorillaz great, the very chill sound that we all have come to love, very reminiscent of tracks featured on Demon Days.<br /><br />  As for the Deluxe package, I found it to be worth it for a few reasons. One you get a 45 min. DVD that can not be found elsewhere, two you get the nighttime cover of the Plastic Beach which looks cooler then the standard, three the access card to the website for the Plastic Beach experience, and fourth the deluxe feels much more substantial and complete then the regular. Go to a store and compare then in person to see what I mean.<br /><br />  Either way, I expect Plastic Beach to contend for album of the year in many peoples lists, don't be hesitant, go out and support one of the best bands of the past 11 years. The trip to Plastic Beach that you take with 2-D, Murdoc, Noodle, and Russell is one you don't want to miss.
B002S0OBN2|1.0|First of all, I'd like to say right up front that I am a tremendous admirer of Andrew Lloyd Webber. I am not one of those people who write reviews only to bash him and denounce his life's work as unsubstanciated trash, nor am I one of those manic \\"Phans\\" who are all torch-and-pitchfork for any attempt at a sequel that comes rolling their way. I'm simply a fan of both him and his previous works who was highly disappointed.     When I first found out there was going to be a sequel to \\"Phantom\\", I hoped Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford would come back to repise their roles. After listening to this album, I am so glad they didn't. I was sorely let down by the quality of \\"Love Never Dies\\", and taking part in it would have only brought them down in my own estimation.        I had heard alternately positive and negative reviews for this show; being a big fan of the original, I was a little curious about this, though leery of the setting at Coney Island. After some deliberation, I decided to just go ahead and take a listen. My fears were justified.      Love Never Dies is a tremendous monstrosity. Set in 1907, ten years after the events of the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (Time discrepancy anyone? I thought the original took place in 1881. Hmm...), and set in New York; or more specifically, Coney Island, of all places; the Phantom has built himself up as an innovator for the freak-shows and attractions at the park. Calling himself Mr. Y, he devises a plan to lure Christine from Paris to sing. To make a long story short, she arrives; tragedy ensues; and the whole thing ends just as abysmally as it starts.      The plot is ridiculously kitsch and predictable. You needn't even have to see it live to know what direction it's going to take, and even then it is beyond unbearable. Even the title itself is deplorable, for SPOILER HERE: one of the principle characters is \\"done away with\\", for lack of another phrase, in a rather merciless and unnecessary manner, proving that love doesindeed die (I hope I didn't give away too much). Lust never dies would be a far more fitting moniker. What should be a celebration of the strength of love and its ability to persevere through any circumstance is instead reduced to a wake, displaying in vivid color the irrevocable tragedy caused by it and the destructive effect it has upon people's lives.      As a word of note to fans of the original, I would like to point out how far removed and very different from \\"Phantom\\" this is; much too different. Andrew Lloyd Webber freely admitted that this was going to be a completely separate work, and in case it doesn't meet your expectations (it REALLY failed to meet mine), he at least met that one.     In case you're wondering, don't go looking for any continuation musically. There is no romantic lullaby like \\"Music of the Night\\" or a beautiful, longing ballad like \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\". Instead, those greats have been replaced by songs like \\"The Beauty Underneath\\", a weird, pounding, rock-stomp, or \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\" which left me feeling sick to my stomach. We all knew ALW was secretly bursting to include more rock in POTO. In LND he's gotten his chance; and boy, did he go all out.      Even character-wise, nothing is the same. The characters are desecrated and made largely one-dimensional, with enough problems to fill an entire season of \\"As the World Turns\\". All of the beautiful characterization that was put into the Phantom himself is done away with for LND. I never though Ramin Karimloo made a very good Phantom, and, unfortunately, it seems the revised character was written around his lackluster portrayal. The Phantom is made very uninteresting. He has no style, no grace, no nobility, and no personality. He's little more than a shadow of his former self. He's no longer a genius, but a freak-show sell-out, everything he aspired not to be in both Leroux's novel and the original play--heck, he isn't even scary!      The rest of the cast is alsochanged considerably. Meg (little Meg Giry!), has seriously gone to the dark side in her role as the lead \\"Ooh-la-la girl\\", a group of seriously underdressed showgirls. For supposedly being French, she comes off too brash and brassy, and not at all the sweet little member of the corps de ballet. Christine is too flat and boring, and doesn't have any of the really sweet, innocent qualities she used to that made her such a compelling character. Oh, and to top it all off, Raoul is a bitter, gambling drunkard, totally lacking in sympathy and warmth. What a group of winners. None of them are in any way appealing; there is far too much anger running through them, enough that it makes you, as the listener, uncomfortable. It really left me wondering,\\"What was anyone thinking?\\" or more probably, \\"Were they thinking?\\". And the resounding answer to that question is No.     What really tore me up emotionally was the lack of sympathy and honest devotion between the Phantom and Christine. Their first meeting, for instance, which should have been a sweet homage to their parting at the end of POTO is nothing more than a gruff confrontation, ending in a sickening duet showcasing an overabundance of bawdiness. The only touching emotional conflict in the whole show is that the Phantom hasn't written any decent music since Christine left him, and has instead produced cheap side-show jingles. A nice tribute, but it leaves me to wonder, did he write the music for LND too?    Concerning the music, Andrew Lloyd Webber has really lost his touch here. The entire score feels like it was written by someone else. Grating, disturbing, and for all intents and purposes Tim-Burton-esque, it is slow-moving and nowhere near the caliber of any of his other work. It doesn't leave you feeling uplifted, but drained and unsettled instead. There is nothing pretty or romantic about it. It has has none of the sweeping, grandiose melodies of POTO, and if you didn't know any better, you could easily pass thisoff as a very poor imitation of a usually good composer.     The songs here aren't even sappy. They're just bad. I actually had to stop and walk away from listening for a while before I got through it, they are just that terrible. They sound like cheap, third-rate songs tossed hap-hazardly into your average third-rate American musical. There is all flash and no substance, and what a weak flash it is, too. The lyrics are clunky and cumbersome, and if they weren't so utterly ridiculous, maybe you'd be able to focus on some of the better points of the score itself. There's hardly a tune out of the whole lot I can remember enough to hum or would even care to. None of them are memorable and certainly will not be ones that are still popular some 20-odd years later. The only exception is the title song \\"Love Never Dies\\", which is very beautiful and classic, a real show-stopper; but is sadly the one and only, and is nothing more than an ominous portent when taken in context with the show.       All of the gorgeous operatic sensibilities that made the original Phantom stand out have been uprooted for the sake of appeasing those who objected to \\"too much Opera\\". Excuse me? It was set inside an Opera house, written by a man who was an opera critic, and has the very word displayed quite blatantly in the title.    As a major fan of POTO I admit to have listened to the original album more times than I can count. I certainly couldn't stand to listen to this album more than once without my head exploding or my eardrums bursting from the overwhelming shrillness of each piece, coupled with the overly-repetetive introduction of electric guitars. The cast as singers are only annoying and seem perfectly content with their terrible habit of over-acting and under-singing lines, which is only magnified by what dribble the material is that they have to work with.     The score by itself certainly has some merit, but with different lyrics and better story I can see working, ideally, in another show, one totally unrelated to \\"Phantom\\"         Those who are more familiar than I am with Webber's earlier works will probably deem this classic ALW; edgy, slightly irreverent, and definitely different than anything else standing in musical theatre; but for something as a follow-up to a show based in an opera house, that style just doesn't fit.    In few words, Love Never Dies is a chaotic, unexciting spectacle (and I mean spectacle in a bad way). It certainly has no makings for being a theatre classic, nor a timeless masterpiece. It doesn't have the nostalgic feel of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", nor the sense of tension or anticipation that was so apparent throughout all of the score. The dismal choice of setting is so completely unsuited to the core subject, it's hard to even believe anyone gave it the green light. I completely understand that ALW aimed to be different, but honestly, when you're dealing with a sequel, shouldn't it at least be a little cohesive to where you started from?        I really blame Mr. Webber for his choice of Glenn Slater as lyricist and Fredrick Forsyth's novel as source material. Don't get me wrong; I think Mr. Webber is a gifted composer who has produced some of the best theater works in the last forty years, nearly all of which have  been received as world-renowned smash-hits; but I personally don't see this as one of his best. The stinker lyrics and bad choice of source material bring it all down. I honestly believe he would have done much better if he had tried to come up with a story himself, rather than depend on the atrocious sell-out \\"Phantom of Manhattan\\" is.       In tone, the show is far too dark and depressing. There is no mystery and absolutely no magic; humor is nonexistent. The romance and wonder is gone, only to be replaced by a drawn-out nightmarish bore. It has none of the poignancy and brilliance of the original, and doesn't carry over well as a continuation of the original story. Honestly, it reminded me of the Joel Schumacher movie adaptation of \\"Phantom\\": bad acting, bad orchestration, so-so singers, and enough grit to sandpaper superglue off a wall. Those who enjoy bodice-busting tales of carnage might like this one, but for those of us who liked the Phantom the way he was, beware.     To quote the Phantom himself (not Karimloo's Phantom, but his earlier incarnations), Love Never Dies is a \\"lamentable mess\\", to put it kindly, and if you are a fan of the original you'll avoid this one. I sure wish I had.
0385341008|5.0|I recently purchased this book in an airport before a 4 hour flight, not really knowing anything about the author or any more about the subject matter than the cover and inside covers hinted at.  The tone of the book and the letter-style format gently but unwaveringly captivated me.  I finished the book shortly after arriving home.  After I finished it, I vowed to re-read it immediately, and get copies for two of my relatives (thus, my Amazon purchase).  Excellent story.  So much information provided in such an unassuming, humble, but entertaining way.  I highly recommend it.<br />P.S.  My gift recipients loved it as much as I did.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Well, maybe my favorite after Captain Jack.  I love humor and energy her character brings to the series, and the absence of all that romatic mooning of Martha.  There's also an air of sadness throughout the series as the doctor becomes increasingly aware of his coming demise in the specials.
0061876747|3.0|I am a William Boyd fan so was not too happy to be led on this chase through the  underarm of London only to land at an uneasy ending.  Adam, the unhero, is on the run. But he begins that way. Happily married, he succumbs to the attention of a female student. His marriage ends as does his job.  A thoughtless act changes his life, so like the original Adam, he is kicked out of Eden--America.  He interviews for a new job in London and a new beginning. But evidently he has learned little from his previous debacle and immediately puts his new life in jeopardy. How?  A chance encounter at a restaurant with the mysterious Mr. Wang. Wang leaves behind \\"papers\\" and Adam decides he must return the papers to  Wang.  Ok, this I suppose could happen.  Wang invites Adam to come up to his apartment for a drink. Adam declines leaving the papers with the front desk and   takes Wang up on his offer.    Blood, death, Wang dying.  Again, Adam makes the wrong choice and now is on the run.  Throughout this ordeal I never felt that Adam has any kind of moral center. And  this plays out as those who help him begin to die.  He has a twinge of conscience and returns to take care of the son of the prostitute who sold him a room in her home.  Throughout his run off the grid, Adam is prepared to kill, steal, do whatever it takes to stay free. He takes away a blind man's cane.  Not an attractive personality to begin with, he becomes less so as we follow him through one preposterous twist after another.  The ending is just that. Abrupt and uneven. Is he being stalked? Are we all being stalked?  And can we have a story that does not have one more wicked pharma ceo  or the usual plot: the drug trials are rigged but the sales are going forward anyway?    Boyd is a wonderful writer but I think he phoned this one in.
B002ZHKZEM|4.0|The title tells it all.  The 11th Doctor, his script writers and producers, have some big shoes to fill.  The Waters of Mars is one of the best Doctor Who stories ever and also one of the most disturbing as the Doctor displays enormous hubris in thinking he can change history and is \\"Lord of Time\\".  His come-upance at the end is tragic.  The Next Doctor and Planet of the Dead are entertaining one off tales.  The End of Time is a typical Russell T. Davies series ending.  If you liked his earlier season endings you'll like this.  If not, well probably you shouldn't buy these DVDs.  Full of action, pulling out all the stops, dragging in all the past companions, etc.  The Doctor actually has about 4 death scenes before the real one; Davies really stretches that out as far as humanly (or Time Lordy) possible.  The final 10 minutes are given over to a sort of farewell tour as the Doctor finds the time, while slowly dying, to play one last visit to all his significant companions of the series.  Personally I lost patience with the tragic, Hamlet like despair Davies and Tennant gave to the Doctor for the past two years.  Every other Doctor took death and regeneration pretty much in stride.  They didn't necessarily like it but accepted it as part of who they were.  The 9th doctor willingly took it on to save Rose for example.  I feel it is a false note for the 10th Doctor to fight death with such despair and tragic overtones as what we've seen in the last regular season and in these specials.  Nonetheless if you are a fan of the 10th Doctor these are must have discs.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|There are a few questions I'd like to ask Mr. Gabriel. Questions like: \\"When is the new album coming out?\\" and \\"When is the new album coming out?\\" Being a fan of Peter Gabriel means you have to wait a decade between albums. Getting an album of covers means a.) I've run out of ideas, or b.) I've run out of ideas. I am not a fan of cover albums. I like the original songs in their original forms.<br /><br />When I looked over the titles that Gabriel was going to cover I thought, \\"There's no way he's going to do 'The Boy In The Bubble', he'll make a mess of it.\\" 'Philadelphia'? Why? 'Street Spirit'? Hmmm. So obviously Gabriel is going to take from interesting sources and not play it safe like so many countless others. Still, I feel that covering Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" is cliche now. Why not pick a riskier selection like \\"Ashes To Ashes\\" or \\"Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)\\"?<br /><br />Of note, Gabriel is 60 years old, and I noticed he selected David Bowie, age 63, Paul Simon, age 68, David Byrne, age 57, Lou Reed, age 68, Randy Newman, age 66, Neil Young, age 64, and Ray Davies, age 65 to cover. So, he mostly picked his peer group. The youngest person is Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver) who is 28. Another thing I noticed is Regina Spektor is the only female artist covered. Also, most of the artists are American, British or Canadian. They are all white artists.<br /><br />That being said, the idea of stripping all these songs down to their bare bones and using an orchestra runs the risk of all the songs sounding alike. I read Gabriel's track by track discussion which was interesting, particularly the story about \\"The Power Of The Heart\\" by Lou Reed. So I respect Gabriel's perspectives and I have to say that his song selections are near perfect. They are all very well written songs if you really listen to them. Paul Simon's \\"The Boy In The Bubble\\" is pure poetry, or David Byrne's \\"The Listening Wind\\" or Lou Reed's \\"The Power Of The Heart\\" or Arcade Fire's \\"My Body Is A Cage\\"--they're all great. Like American Idol, it's all about song selection, dog.<br /><br />As I said earlier, \\"Heroes\\" is a classic track, but it's been covered so many times that it feels like a cliche to cover that particular Bowie track. Gabriel does it justice, paring it down to really get at the lyrics, and I have to admit it was a revelation being able to hear every nuance of Bowie's writing without the layers of Eno's studio wizardry. Gabriel's vocals are spot on, and they're near perfect throughout the entire album.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about \\"The Boy In The Bubble\\". Gabriel really stripped this one bare, and it took a while to grow on me, but it's still one of my least favorite tracks here.<br /><br />I had never heard Elbow's \\"Mirrorball\\", but Gabriel makes the melody work here. The lyrics are well written and poetic.<br /><br />I had also never heard Bon Iver's \\"Flume\\", and I have to say that Gabriel's vocals here really soar. This might be his best sung song on the album, really echoing that old Gabriel of yore that us fans are still waiting to have back someday.<br /><br />I really liked Talking Heads' \\"Listening Wind\\", and I am a huge Talking Heads fan, and I think this song selection was probably the most brilliant for Gabriel. It has all the elements of a great Gabriel song--intense vocals telling a story about something sinister or painful. This is the first highlight of the album.<br /><br />I searched and re-searched for \\"The Power Of The Heart\\" by Lou Reed because I thought I was losing my marbles as it did not appear on any of his solo albums or Velvet Underground albums. Then I read how he had written it recently for Laurie Anderson and was playing it live at his shows. If that isn't obscure I don't know what is. However, this is a fantastic song, and I can't believe Lou Reed wrote it, and that Gabriel asked him to add more lyrics, and Lou Reed was happy to do so! Amazing. The second highlight of this album. One of my favorite tracks here.<br /><br/>I like Arcade Fire, and I have both of their albums, but \\"My Body Is A Cage\\" was not a track that I remembered well from their \\"Neon Bible\\" album. So, I kind of heard Gabriel's version with a fresh ear, and while this is one of the most dramatic songs on the disc, it was good, but not great.<br /><br />I had never heard of The Magnetic Fields or \\"The Book Of Love\\". I was unaware of the back story on the song, but it is easily the third highlight of this album. Great lyrics and melody, and an ideal first single.<br /><br />I love Randy Newman, have all of his albums, but I still can't help thinking that doing another cover of \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" is, like Bowie's \\"Heroes\\", and cliche. I can't tell you how many versions of that song I think I've heard. I wish he had picked \\"I Want You To Hurt Like I Do\\" or \\"It's Money That I Love\\" or \\"Better Off Dead\\". This is the most straightforward cover on the album, and the one that sounds most like the original.<br /><br />I love Regina Spektor, and I have all of her albums, and \\"Apres Moi\\" was a bizarre choice. I don't really remember that track from \\"Begin To Hope\\", but Gabriel does a blitzkrieg version here and while it is the second most dramatic track, it is just okay.<br /><br />As I said earlier, I don't know why Gabriel chose to cover Neil Young's contribution to the 1993 \\"Philadelphia\\" soundtrack. The funny thing being \\"Lovetown\\" by Gabriel was also on that soundtrack. Why not \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\"? Or how about \\"People On The Street\\". Or \\"The Needle And The Damage Done\\"? This is the one track that I really like Neil Young's version much more than Gabriel's.<br /><br />However, the worst cover is Radiohead's \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\". What was he thinking? The worst. I don't care if I ever listen to that track again.<br /><br />On the bonus disc is The Kinks' \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", which, again, has been done so many times. Gabriel does a good job with it. The other three bonus tracks, to me, sounded identical to the album versions, and I don't even know why Gabriel bothered.<br /><br />So while we wait for \\"I/O\\", Gabriel's alleged new album that will be out around 2020 or 2030, we have this classical approach to pop standards of the day. After repeatedly listening to \\"Scratch My Back\\" all week long, it grew on me. I couldn't decide whether to give it three or four stars, and annoyingly, I can't select three and a half stars, which is what I give this. Not my favorite Gabriel album, but it will do. At least there are a handful of songs I will add to my \\"Gabriel Greatest\\" compilation.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This is the definitive Anime Blu-Ray. Series creator Anno Hideaki's attempt to retell his critically acclaimed Neon Genesis Evangelion has received the 1080p treatment it so certainly deserved. In so doing it has now set the bar for HD Anime. Sony's SBMV (Super Bit Mapping for Video) Technology allows for much smoother colour gradients as compared to its 1.01 counterpart. As such the animation comes across as being extremely polished. The anime features some of the best 2D-3D integration I've ever seen in anime. However the true star of this release is the 6.1ch Japanese and English audio tracks. Every screech, stomp, blast and cicada chirp is crystal clear and should satisfy even the most demanding audiophile. The packaging borrowed from the Japanese version in terms of form but with a completely different art style. It's distinct, beautiful and definitely stands out next to most commercial Blu-Ray packaging. For fans of Anime this buy is a must.
B00169N0BK|5.0|I've owned the color munki for about a month now and I've done 3 or 4 monitor calibrations and two printer calibrations.  Here is what I can say about it: the color munki comes with its own software and mine needed to be patched before I could use it.  Of course, you have to install the software and then run the program before you know it needs a patch but before it tells you about the patch, the first thing it wants to do is have you register at their website, so I did. Then it told me about an update being available, so I downloaded it.  The update does not auto install so you need to go through all that again.  At which time it will again ask you to register the software.  Now, that threw me a bit and I wondered if perhaps the first registration didn't take. So I registered again.  No harm, no foul - just a bit of a bump during installation.<br /><br />After all that, everything went smoothly and the color munki is performing as advertised.  My monitor is calibrated and my printer is calibrated and almost everything prints as it is displayed on the screen.  I say almost everything because my blacks are just different enough that I can notice. I haven't had the time to do an advanced calibration but I am hoping that when I do it solves that problem. The munki is on the expensive side of the scale, but I wanted a good calibrator and I'm sure once I deal with the blacks problem I'll be totally satisfied.<br /><br />The munki is well built and the case it comes with is nice also.  The zipper allows you to fully enclose the case but still access the port to plug the wire into it.  Rotating the knob is a bit weird for me - just awkward I guess.  But not a big issue.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can calibrate several paper types and have the profiles saved for future use.
0316044695|5.0|This is an amazing book.  Luttrell's story is more than just an account of a guy's struggle through SEAL training and eventual combat. It's a gut-wrenching look into what sacrifices our guys are willing to make for their country. And it poses some serious questions about our treatment of non-combatants and the rules of engagement in a very hostile place.    To the reviewers who gave the book low ratings:  Luttrell isn't trying to write War and Peace; he's simply giving  his account of a fierce battle which claimed the lives of three of his friends.  If his writing style is unsophisticated, so be it.  He's a straight-up guy giving his version of events, not a poet.  Yes, he tosses in his political views and can be repetitious, but I'll forgive him that.  I have enormous respect for this man.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|I saw this movie as a teenager when it was first released and I never forgot it.  At the time, of course, the special effects seemed impressive, particularly the ascent to Carousel.  Now, the miniature of the domed city, the robot in the ice caves, and the various other effects might seem dated or primitive, but they still serve their purpose for the framework of this film.  The timeless themes of people trying to find their place in the world, of trying to trust their own instincts vs. the information presented as gospel by political leaders, and of finding humanity in an inhumane world are still relevant and still interesting.  There are some very good performances by the leads Michael York and Jenny Agutter, and a scene-stealing performance by Peter Ustinov.    I recommend adding this film to your science fiction collection.  Although not perfect, it is one of those films that withstands the test of time and that remains watchable, interesting, and memorable decades later.
B0020TS5JM|5.0|I think the title of my review makes my stance clear. I rented this movie on iTunes and then bought it as soon as it was available on Blu-Ray. The visuals are magnificent and the story fits partially with the legend of Beowulf, although it is not meant really to be an explanation for the legend. The beast in the movie is fantastic and the fact that it takes place in Norway in the 8 century AD is also very interesting. The Viking parts were not too overplayed and the villages were well thought out. The Viking Hall is one of my favorite structures in the movie, even though it is mostly CGI.

B002S0OBMS|4.0|Being a big fan of the original, I had high hopes for this show....I'm not disappointed! I've listened to it for four days straight now, and I really like it. The story is interesting, and pretty easy to follow when listening to the music. Now, I hate the fact that the CD does not contain the libretto of the show, so I'm downgrading the over all product a star. It do think this show is going to be a big fat hit!
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|This was just a fun movie-the dialogue was witty, the character interaction was believable and plausible, the special effects were decent (I never saw it in 3-d), the action kept you interested.  I don't think this movie will make it in the history books as a serious contender for a great remake of the Jules Verne novel, but it's a fun family movie to watch and laugh over!
4770030096|3.0|First of all, don't bother with the Romaji version - get a good Hiragana book (Mitamura's Let's Learn Hiragana or the one from Tuttle Library).  You should be able to learn all hiragana within a month.  When I first picked up this book, being all kana was a little scary, although now that I've been working with it for 2 mos. it's not bad at all.  This book has a lot going for it, although now I wish it had some kanji in it so I could start getting used to seeing it.  The vocabulary and dialogues in this book all seem very useful and I can envision myself needing to use the vocabulary, which is good.  You don't want to waste time learning words you're not likely to use.  The bad news is that (at least for the first few chapters) the exercises are not very challenging - they are all substitution exercises with the words you're supposed to replace already in Japanese so you could successfully complete the exercises without fully comprehending what you're writing.  There are no translation exercises, nothing to really challenge your understanding.  Vocabulary (and grammar) as stated in the book has been thinned down to 1/3 that of a typical college course, and I feel that there really could be more vocabulary included (e.g. when you're taught colors, you learn a total of just 4 colors, although if you look in the back of the book you'll find some more that are not incl. in the text).  Although it's stated that this book is for the self learner as well as the classroom, the self learner may find that the grammar explanations are a little thin.  I do like how the chapters are organized into units (2-3 chapters/unit) with a one-page grammar summary at the beginning of ea. unit (so you can see what you're getting into).  The incl. CD is good although be forewarned that it does not start out at a beginner pace.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I have now been using this text for 10 months and am just about done with it.  Many of my initial observations still stand:  exercises are not very challenging, grammar explanation is rather brief and not very in-depth, and the lack of kanji is a real drawback.  You'll find you need to supplement this text with others for additional grammar and some kanji.  Also, some of the grammar could be better taught.  When learning the -Te form for verbs, this book presents the reader with a short list and says \\"memorize these\\", while nowhere are the rules on how they are formed.  Verbs are presented already conjugated into the -masu form, with no mention of the originating dictionary form, so consequently students would be unable to conjugate new verbs into the -masu form, let alone even find the known verbs in their dictionaries.  Also, it takes about 1/2 of the book before you actually get into using verbs other than \\"to be\\".  So, for those who are willing to study every day and want to be challenged, this book disappoints.  For those who don't have the time to study, this book will not overload you too much.nging, grammar explanation is rather brief and not very in-depth, and the lack of kanji is a real drawback.

B00007K02F|5.0|I haven't read the book nor have seen other movies of this book. I really liked this movie. Although it has a tried and true formulae, I found it refreshing and captivating. It has few witty lines that tickled my funny bone. It was good to see William Hurt when he was younger. I enjoyed seeing Maria Shriver although it was a small part. It was a very realistic movie as I have had the same experiences as the author of the book. Highly recommended.
0307463745|3.0|The book is fine, but I don't agree with the 5 star ratings posted. It is a simple collection of rules for making a productive work environment. The workplace is full of interruptions; avoid them. Meetings are not worth the time; don't have them. Big companies are behemoths; there are advantages to being small and nimble. Working all the time is the mark of an inefficient worker. Many of these topics could make memorable New Yorker-style essays if they were given more rigorous treatment with case studies to illustrate their authoritative claims. For instance, there are great examples of behemoth software companies routinely showing up with 'me too' type technologies (Microsoft), while other behemoth companies seem to be driving forward with novel contributions (Google). A case study of the cultures at these two companies would probably make a very compelling read and provide opportunities to address nearly all of the authors points. How is Google able to avoid the downfall of many other large companies?  But I don't think the authors were aspiring to writing memorable, thorough essays with compelling examples. And they didn't. They wrote a book with just 'good enough' writing ('good enough' is another of their efficiency rules)--unfortunately. I suggest picking it up at the library.

B002JTHFUS|5.0|though i had been a fan of u2 prior to this album, this was the most memorable for me at the time. i was a freshman in college & though this album wasn't new, it was rather recent. working in the college radio station i was able to actually listen to this album quite a lot & fell in love with it. \\"pride in the name of love\\" was the first single i believe & i wasn't immediately impressed, but it was not until i heard \\"bad\\" that i was moved. this was a special treat because  even though i had the previous three albums, this was the one i listened to the most until the joshua tree was released 3 years later.   i also love that this album feels somewhat moody or atmospheric; it feels very calming. \\"wire\\" & \\"indian summer sky\\" are definitely full of energy, but this felt like a real artistic change from this quartet.
B0035G9ABG|5.0|Plastic Beach is a real masterpiece and a real grower of an album.  The album is more diverse in style than either of the first two phases of Gorillaz, but simultaneously all of a piece.  The album is thematic and surprisingly cohesive.  There are more and more tracks which get lodged in my head, addictively catchy tunes.    The Experience addition, here, comes with a code for additional online access.  Also included is a dvd.  The dvd program is great for real fans of Gorillaz.  It gives a fun and enlightening behind-the-scenes look at some of the collaborations in studio (with De La Soul, Bobby Womack, Mos Def, Little Dragon and others).  It's nice to hear from Damon explaining the concepts of the album and his approach to making records.  We also get to look behind the scenes on Jamie's artistic creations and the whole construction of Plastic Beach.  The DVD also drops some songs and sounds not heard on the album, including a bit of the Horrors collaboration, things which might turn up as b-sides (Beach Sides?) at some point.    So, in conclusion, this record is fantastic and hardcore fans like myself are going to want to have this package with the dvd.
1552091090|1.0|I got this book for as a gift, and it's the most disturbing children's book I've ever read. The son goes from baby to grown man in 3 pages, and his mother ages about 3 times as fast as he does. In a few pages she's about 90 while her son is still young. Then, she calls to tell him she's dying, and he cradles her in his arms and sings to her?! There's no joy in it. It's a terrible, terrible book and I won't read it to my children.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|For a long time, I had been put off the show by its synopsis since the wold of drug world was a world that did not appeal to me.  I finally succomed to the awards and beneath the radar word of mouth and found that while it was about drugs, the show was an intelligent and clever look at how a regular guy reacts and interacts with a strata of society with which his is totally unfamiliar (as am I).  After the first couple of episodes I felt that I knew and understood the Cranston character and was facinated to watch the roller coaster ride his life had turned into for all the right reasons.  The stupidity of the protagonists never disappoints in surprising you with the smartness of the writers and the enjoyable slant of the producers.  The one bare breast in the first episode is not repeated during the first season so don't be put off by that nipple if you are prudish.  Breaking Bad is a smart, thrilling and fast pased roller coaster ride that makes poigniant observation of middle class life and generates genuine sympathy for the lead character that soon has you rooting for him.  I can hardly wait for Season 2 to come out next week.    I put Breaking Bad in the same league as Weeds and (one of my all time favorites) The Wire.

I expected Woody to carry the film comedically but was sadly disappointed to find that the film lacked any shred of sophistication or cleverness.  It was just another sensless zombie fest whose repetitive calling card was unimaginative dispatch of zombies.  On a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being the best I rate Zombieland a \\"3\\".

My dear husband picked it up at the English bookstore in Paris for me.  Nice surprise.  Friends and family are arguing over who gets it next!!!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Use of an external flash unit is a good way to improve your photography. The built-in flash on the average camera is okay, but it only points forward and you can't rotate it. With an external flash unit, you have a more powerful flash and you can change the position of the flash in order to bounce the light off a wall or off the ceiling.    This small size of this external flash makes it easier to carry around and also doesn't make the camera itself significantly heavier. While you may want a larger flash for a studio shoot, this is perfect if you want an external flash unit when you're on the go.
1450539785|5.0|This is the re-release of the original or an exact copy of the 2nd edition released with Mary Shellys name on it. Even though this is an old story and most of us are somewhat familiar with it. Actually reading the words on paper actually makes it more bone chilling than one would think. Mary Shelly had quite an imagination and if you don't believe me read this book! A classic.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I rented this again since I liked it quite a bit in the theater. I'm upset that it isn't closed captioned, especially since Carl, the main character wears a hearing aid. I'm hearing impaired. I enjoyed this film immensely, but I wanted to see it again to catch the audio I missed. I couldn't believe it isn't closed captioned. I can barely pick up anything the dogs are 'saying', particularly the one with the chipmunk voice. Shame on Disney, I thought everything is closed captioned now.

0307454541|4.0|Everyone I knew was reading \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\". None of them could put it down. They devoured it. I was intrigued by the spell this author cast on these readers. What's his secret? I had to know.<br /><br />So I read it myself. Surprisingly, I couldn't seem to get into it until about the 200-page mark. And, no, not because he spends a lavish amount of time on the legal troubles of the magazine and the perils of financial journalism. (I rather enjoyed that part.) I just found all the principal characters . . . well, unlikeable. Lisabeth Salander is anti-social at face-value. The writer presents her as hard-to-like. (So I don't count that against the novel.) But Mikael Blomkvist, the main character--the man through whose eyes we experience the story--is an unscrupulous scoundrel. He sleeps with another man's wife, immediately cheats on her with an older woman, and then--for no reason whatsoever--sleeps with Salander (a rape victim, young enough to be his daughter). He's an exceptionally sleazy guy with absolutely no conscience--so it's particularly grating when he hypocritically rants on about morality when it comes to the financier Wennerstrom. Likewise with his soapbox (and paternalistic) preaching about violence-against-women.<br /><br />The guy is as amoral as they come, yet he demands morality from others, without the slightest moment of cognitive dissonance (or self-awareness) on his part.<br /><br />Additionally, Larsson makes rookie mistakes as a writer when he takes things too far. Like when he cheesily makes Salander have a \\"photographic memory\\". Anyone conversant with the subject knows that only about 3 people in all history have had a documented \\"photographic memory\\". It's extraordinarily rare. So when he gives the attribute to Salander, it just comes off as silly. (We already liked her at that point. So he should have left well-enough alone. But he threw in that cheese, and added a blemish to an otherwise wonderful character.) Likewise when he has her mention her habit of finishing equations in astrophysics (after dozens of references throughout the book where people assume she's mentally disabled). We get that she has a mind. You don't have to throw in embarrassing stuff like \\"astrophysics\\". Reminded me of an axiom from film-making. When a famous director saw a ham over-acting, he'd simply say \\"Less!\\"<br /><br />At those moments when Larsson did that, I felt like saying, \\"Less!\\"<br /><br />But this is all mere quibbling. The story itself is wonderful, gripping and fresh.

0596007124|5.0|I've been programming for over 20 years, and in the last few years I've been learning Object Oriented programming in Java and .Net.  I've read lots of books and articles on how to do object oriented design.  If I had to write a business program that needed a Cat object that inherited from from Pet, or a Circle object that inherited from Shape, I'd have been set to go.  But until now, I couldn't find business oriented examples of how to design a program on object oriented principles.  This book is the answer!  It's easy to read and understand while delivering complex concepts.  Their examples are simple enough that you don't get bogged down in a lot of irrelevant details, but complex enough to be realistic.  I'm only half way through the book at this point, but if I had to stop now, it would still be worth the money and time spent on it.  I highly recommend this book.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is the second book about a slave family that I've recently read. The first was Breena Clarke's fine novel, [[ASIN:0316007056 Stand the Storm]]. Both deal with Black families struggling to care for each other and to cope under a system of slavery that deprives them of power and recognition of their status as human beings.<br /><br />Both books also depict the complications in the lives of slaves who are half-white, the frequent result when slave owners and overseers took advantage of slave women. (I was drawn to this theme right now because my own first novel - [[ASIN:B003AKY5IA As Far as Blood Goes]], about a fugitive slave who becomes a doctor - also cast the protagonist as his master's son. I wrote it over 20 years ago, but have just finished editing it for Amazon Kindle formatting.)<br /><br />As Breena Clarke won some renown as a writer when her first book was featured on Oprah's Book Club, I wondered if Kathleen Grissom's novel could \\"compete\\" in my estimation. Actually I found The Kitchen House the more compelling. Once I'd read the free sample on my Kindle, I immediately pressed the Buy button and could barely put the book down till I came to the last page.<br /><br />I don't mean this review as a comparison of the two novels, but will mention that the family of seamstresses and tailor in Stand the Storm, are the property of a master who brutally rapes and impregnates nearly every female slave on his plantation, selling his own offspring with impunity. By contrast, the situation at Tall Oaks plantation, where The Kitchen House is set, is more nuanced. Though I hesitate to take issue with Clarke, I found Grissom's historical depiction more believable.<br /><br />Cap'n Pyke, the plantation owner in The Kitchen House, does have a child by one of his slaves. But the captain is at bottom a well meaning man, though one whose vision is limited by his times and the slave-based society he has grown up in. So he genuinely cares for his daughter, Belle, yet shunts her aside when he finally brings home a wife at the age of 40.<br /><br />Belle has been brought up in the \\"big house\\" - the plantation house -- till age seven by her white grandma (Cap'n Pyke's mother), who has accepted her as a grandchild. But when the captain brings home the wife he hopes will take over the reins of the plantation after his mother's death, he has Belle abruptly evicted from this home. Now, as cook for the big house, she presides over the kitchen house, which also serves as her home. (In fine Southern houses of the period the kitchen was located in a separate building.)<br /><br />And when two Irish immigrants, on the ship Cap'n Pyke owns and is captain of, die on the journey before they can repay their passage, he thinks nothing of separating their two youngsters -- depriving each of the only family they have left. The older child, a boy, is easy to place as an indentured servant. Lavinia - not quite seven, thin as a rail and too traumatized even to eat - is brought home and handed over to Belle to help out in the kitchen with no great care as to whether she thrives or dies.<br /><br />Cap'n Pyke means to do right by his family and his slaves, but he is an absentee plantation owner, an absentee husband and an absentee father. On his visits home, he sees what he wants to see - something I found very believable. It is his neglect and his decisions that set a series of horrific events in motion - but the story is told not by him, but in alternating chapters by Belle and Lavinia.<br /><br />In many ways, theirs are parallel stories. Both have lost their families and their place in the world at just about the same age - Lavinia through the death of her parents, and Belle when her grandmother dies without warning. And both cling to what family is left to them, even at the expense of freedom or independence. In fact, Grissom's novel is not so much a novel about history or about slavery - though the lives of the characters are defined by their times andby the slave society they live in - as about family.<br /><br />I found it very believable that the orphaned Lavinia, treated with concern and kindness by Belle and by Mama Mae and Papa George - the couple who are matriarch and patriarch of the house slaves -- would grow to love them as her adopted family. And I found it likewise believable that Belle, too, would cling to her family of fellow slaves and the only home she has known rather than accept the \\"freedom papers\\" her white father halfheartedly offers. (Belle tells us her story as it is happening -- unlike Lavinia, who narrates as an adult looking back on her childhood and coming-of-age years - but her childhood is already over when the book begins. She describes it in the second chapter, so this is not a spoiler.)<br /><br />The setting and history of The Kitchen House are impeccably researched and beautifully woven into the story. The descriptions are evocative of time and place, and Grissom is an extremely able story-teller. Nor does she sugarcoat the institution of slavery, though her story is narrated by a white indentured servant and a relatively privileged house slave. (The absentee, Cap'n Pyke, for instance puts a harsh overseer in charge of the field slaves, whose children are fed from a trough like pigs.)<br /><br />The events of The Kitchen House are also great soap opera - and I mean this as praise, not putdown - and are set into motion largely by Cap'n Pyke's decision to keep Belle's parentage secret. This is the root of dramatic misunderstandings and events. When the book begins -- after a terrifying prologue set 20 years in the future -- Belle is a beautiful young woman of eighteen, to whom the captain pays private visits and gives small gifts. Not knowing the real reasons for her husband's favorable treatment of Belle, Miss Martha, the captain's wife, is free to draw her own conclusions.<br /><br />Although this makes for a gripping plot, that this would remain a secret from Cap'n Pyke's wife and family was the one sticking-point for me. Belle has told us that she was moved from the big house when the captain married Miss Martha \\"because the cap'n don't want Miss Martha to know about me.\\" Still, there is not a slave on the plantation who does not know or guess that he has fathered her.<br /><br />In the nonfiction book [[ASIN:0394722531 The Plantation Mistress: Woman's World in the Old South]], the plantation-raised author Mary Boykin Chesnut is quoted as writing, \\"Any lady is ready to tell you who is the father of all the mulatto children in everybody's household but her own. Those, she seems to think, drop from the clouds....\\" The implication of course, is that the mistress is willfully not seeing, but Miss Martha is portrayed as genuinely not seeing.<br /><br />The implication too is that these \\"mulatto\\" children are the subject of much gossip among the ladies of the various plantations. Kathleen Grissom has taken care to make Tall Oaks unusually isolated, and during the months of the captain's sea voyages, his wife could not travel on her own, nor did she entertain visitors. Still, I found it hard to swallow that no one, whether white neighbor or trusted house slave, would set her straight even as disaster piled upon disaster. If not for this, I would give the book an unqualified Five.<br /><br />However, despite my difficulty with \\"the willing suspension of disbelief\\" on this point, I found The Kitchen House one of the most compelling and thought-provoking novels I've read in some time.

B002VKE1K2|2.0|Just wanted to be startled (at least)... - Needless to say, it was one of the worst 'horror' movies I've ever seen. Not even a thriller, if you like. All I wanted was to be moved or touched in any way by the story - was I asking too much? Apparently. I just wanted something to happen and nothing did. As a watcher, I do not care about the budget of the movie: I care about liking the outcome.     The only thing the movie did was make me hope something worthy would happen until the end of it; and I hoped and hoped and when the end came and nothing has still happened, I just picked another movie to watch.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I hadn't followed the Oscars in years until I found out that The Hurt Locker was a contender in all the major categories. IMHO its wins were deserved. The direction, the acting--just incredible. I first heard about it from my son (a two-timer to Iraq) while the movie was in post production and he was anxiously awaiting its release.<br />It was a very difficulty movie to watch: the tension, the suspense, the portrayal of the damage that's done to a soldier's psyche. All of it combined did a great job of de-glorifying war; not just the Middle East mess we're in, but all war.<br />Please see it; it is very worthwhile.

B002XMGGK6|5.0|Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) watches helplessly as his family is slaughtered by two thugs who break into his home.  Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is the prosecutor who, in order to maintain his high prosecution rate of 96%, strikes a plea bargain that shocks and angers Clyde.  The thug who orchestrated the home invasion, Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte), only receives a few years in prison while his partner, Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart), is given the death penalty.<br /><br />  Ten years later, Ames is being prepped for lethal injection, which is suppose to be painless.  However, chemicals are switched and his death is horrifyingly gruesome.  Darby is abducted and slowly tortured to death by having his limbs amputated without anesthesia.  Shelton is arrested for the murders and imprisoned.  Somehow he is able to continue killing everyone associated with the case.  Once a law abiding citizen, Shelton is determined to teach Nick that you should never make deals with murderers.<br /><br />  Expertly directed by F. Gary Gray and beautifully filmed in Philadelphia, \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" is the best vigilante justice film I've seen since Charles Bronson starred in \\"Death Wish.\\"  Gerard Butler and Jamie Fox head a stellar cast that had a great time working together on this film as evidenced by the commentary provided by producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel.<br /><br />  Gerard Butler, superstar of such megahits as \\"300\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" gives a very convincing performance as a loving family man whose obsession for vengeance drives him to insanity.  Initially, I, along with many others, sympathized with Clyde's plight; I even cheered him on as he killed Ames and Darby.  However, the killing soon got out of hand and Clyde was quickly transformed from hero to villain.<br /><br />  Jamie Foxx (\\"In Living Color\\" television series) and Regina Hall (\\"Scary Movie\\" franchise) greatly surprised me.  I must admit to having never seen either one of them in a thriller.  Like Gerard Butler, both of them are well rounded performers.  Foxx's character, Nick, began as a type of self centered, materialistic villain who cared more about his success rate than the personal feelings of his clients.  To him, they were only statistics.  However, Nick undergoes a transformation while struggling to prevent Clyde from claiming more victims.  He lives to regret having made deals with the men responsible for slaughtering Clyde's wife and daughter.<br /><br />  Anchor Bay Entertainment has released a wonderful DVD presentation for \\"Law Abiding Citizen.\\"  It has an anamorphic widescreen presentation of 2:40:1 that looks superb on a high definition television.  Subtitles have been provided for those of us who are deaf and hearing impaired.  There are some interesting special features that are essential viewing.  The most frightening one to me is \\"The Justice of Law Abiding Citizen.\\"  It actually provides the loop holes (Felony Murder Rule, Exclusionary Rule and the Plea Deal) that made it possible for Darby to testify against Ames who received the death penalty even though it was Darby who committed the actual murders.  Forensic evidence and eyewitness testimony are also discussed in regards to how they can be perverted in order to free a suspect.<br /><br />  Trailers were provided for several movies:  \\"The Crazies\\" - a remake of George Romero's classic horror film; \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" - a comedy of psychic experimentation starring George Clooney, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges; Michael Moore's documentary \\"Capitalism: A Love Story;\\" and the bloody and erotic \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand.\\"<br /><br />  If you enjoy watching vigilante justice films, then I highly recommend watching \\"Law Abiding Citizen.\\"  It is a gritty, violent, emotional thriller that is quite provocative.  It asks the question:  \\"How far will you go to avenge the murder of a loved one?\\"  It makes the viewer wonder how unjust our justice system really is.  One thing is certain, Nick will never again make deals with murderers.<br /><br />Joseph B. HoyosJoseph B. Hoyos

B002RVZV9K|4.0|\\"It Might Get Loud\\" is, at heart, a movie about the creative process that contrasts the process of three very different guitarists that are united by a gift for creating new and interesting sounds with one of the most simple of instruments- the guitar.  This is not a film about guitar craft, as such, nor does it propose that Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White are necessarily \\"the best\\" of their prospective generations.  This is not about the glories of fame and fortune or a gossipy dissection of sordid lives- this movie is a celebration of the artistic process that provides in equal measure the inspiration, work ethic and craft of creating something new.  What unites these three players is an artistic restlessness and a willingness to go outside the boundaries of what came before- the main criticism that I hear about this movie is- \\"Yeah sure, Jimmy Page and The Edge but what is Jack White doing there?  He doesn't belong in the pantheon, not yet and probably never will.\\"- Well, Sir or Madame, I respectfully disagree- not only that but your criticism is beside that point- like I said earlier- this movie doesn't presume that these are \\"The best of the best\\"- what \\"It Might Get Loud\\" sets out to do is contrast 3 different guitarist from 3 different generations who each have redefined the way people hear music through innovative approaches to the guitar.  It humanizes and demystifies it's subjects by first showing them in their native habitat and giving a thumbnail sketch of their backgrounds and musical inspirations- it then gets to the heart and main attraction- the 3 sitting together with nothing but their guitars and the result is, well, not explosive and that is kind of the point- any musician will recognize that situation and completely relate- what happens is what sometimes happens at parties or the beach or park- a couple of strangers with nothing in common but guitars sit for a little while and trade songs and talk about music- every musician has done this and to be a fly on the wall of this summit is to recognize the universality and brother/sisterhood of music- any musician can see this movie and say to themselves \\"I may not be a big star- make records or tour the world but I am, in a small way, in the same club as these guys.\\"  My favorite moment- Jimmy Page playing air guitar along with one of his favorite songs- who hasn't done that?to be a fly on the wall of this summit is to recognize the universality and brother/sisterhood of music- any musician can see this movie and say to themselves \\"I may not be a big star- make records or tour the world but I am, in a small way, in the same club as these guys.\\"  My favorite moment- Jimmy Page playing air guitar along with one of his favorite songs- who hasn't done that?
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My dog and I watched this last night, and it was unbelievable.  I was upset when it was bumped from theaters, but after seeing it I am guessing it is because the movie was a little more on the artistic side rather than mainstream.<br /><br />One of the articles that I read about the movie before it came out described it as story that shows that love knows no species, and that couldn't have been more apparent through Hachi and his devotion to the professor.  It ripped my heart out to watch him walk to the train station every night waiting for his master to return, even after the professor had died.<br /><br />I cried like a baby even after the movie was over.  Anyone who believes that animals don't have feelings just needs to watch Hachi's story and there will be no question.

Dierdre undoubtedly from Ireland hires several Ronin to form a team in order to retrieve an important suitcase from a man who is about to sell it to the Russians. After the mission has been completed successfully, the suitcase immediately gets switched by a member of the team who seems to work into his own pocket. The complex net of everyone tricking everyone begins to surface slowly, and deadly. The cast is good and the direction is smooth and keeps the story flowing and it'll keep you guessing right up to the very end about just exactly what is going on and who everyone is. Then, there are the car chases and they are awesome. De Niro and Reno are brilliant in this as of course you would expect from two such excellent actors. This movie is enjoyable and pacy piece of entertainment.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I mean that literally, as my reviews keep getting taken down.  Maybe the list of unacceptable language has expanded.  To try hard to stay within the boundaries, apparently I am reduced to saying that I profoundly disliked this film.  It appeared to be a cynical manipulation of a large segment of the public, using thickly-strewn special effects, rapid cuts, and a tremendous number of cliches as a substitute for an actual story, plot, believable characters, and some sort of dramatic tension.  Almost every previously-used stereotype in history shows up somewhere in this rather bad movie, including stereotypes of fathers, minorities, eggheads, Americans, women, and if they could have found a way they would have stereotyped the asteroid as well.  The behavior of the characters obeys no logic recognizable on the planet Earth, except the logic that says \\"You must behave this way next, so that we can use the next cool special effect.  Yeah, take this machine-gun to an uninhabited asteroid.  We know that it makes no sense, but shooting and blowing things up appeals to a large segment of the viewing public, so we're throwing it in.  And, based on our marketing research, you'll be flying the Shuttle in a tuxedo and bow tie while carrying a silenced Beretta in a shoulder holster.\\"  As a result, this ranks with Jaws 3-D and My Dinner with Andre as the only three movies I have walked out on before they finished.    The story is that Ben Affleck asked the director if it wouldn't make more sense for NASA to teach astronauts to drill a hole, rather than trying to teach a drilling crew to be astronauts.  The director reportedly told him to shut up.  Now I ask you: What has America come to, when Ben Affleck becomes the voice of reason?
B002VKE1K2|4.0|A haunted house makes no secret of the fact it's not pleased with its new tenants in this independent tale of supernatural horror. Katie and Micah are a twentysomething couple who've just moved into a new home in San Diego, CA. Katie has an interest in the paranormal and believes that malevolent spirits have been following her since childhood, though Micah is not so easily convinced. However, after several nights of loud noises and strange happenings, Micah starts to agree with Katie that some sort of ghost may have followed them to the new home. After a paranormal researcher tells the couple he can't help them, Micah decides to take control of the situation and sets up a battery of video cameras so that if a spirit manifests itself, he can capture its behavior on tape. Once the surveillance cameras are in place, Katie and Micah bring in a Ouija board in an effort to talk to the spirits, a move that deeply offends the ghosts. \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is a real chill-up-the-spine movie that's bound to induce nightmares, the effect is much, much more psychologically terrifying than any regular blood-fest.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|I have been watching Woody Allen films since the laugh out loud funny early films Sleeper and Bananas. He reached the top of his form with Annie Hall and the beautifully filmed Manhattan. Since then, there have been some decent films, but most have been disappointing. Moving to Europe seems to have worked for him, first with the excellent Match Point and now with his best film in years. Vicky Cristina Barcelona features a great cast, an excellent script and picturesque locations in Spain. I recommend the blu-ray version for the shots of Gaudi's architectural creations in Barcelona and the scenery in Oviedo. Don't miss this one.

Colonel Hal Moore and 400 young fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons, all troopers from an elite American combat division, were surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. The ensuing battle was one of the most savage in U.S. history. We Were Soldiers Once and Young is a tribute to the nobility of those men under fire, their common acts of uncommon valor, and their loyalty to and love for one another. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" will move you from start to finish. A mind blowing movie that show what these soldiers go through to protect the country that they love. Mel Gibson and his acting adds to the quality of the movie. This movie is not for the fainthearted. It is a rollercoaster of intense battles and emotional roller-coaster rides that I would suggest it to anyone.

0316044938|1.0|I could only make it halfway through this book.  When it was originally published, the premise didn't interest me. Frankly, it sounded a bit wacky, and I prefer novels with a more \\"grounded\\" structure.  Then the film came out this year and I figured I'd give the book a try. After all, it had gotten rave reviews and sold over a million copies.      I made it halfway through the book. I kept hoping that it would get more interesting, that the suspense would build, that I would care about any of the characters, or that I'd be entertained.  None of those things happened.  By page 170, I didn't care about any of the characters. I felt only occasional twinges of emotion.    The book's narration had major problems--supposedly the book is being told by a 14-year-old. Half the time I felt annoyed by having to listen to a teenager and see the world through her eyes. The other half of the time I felt like I was reading a grown-up novel.  While I certainly preferred the passages of the novel with a more grown-up voice, it didn't exactly feel coherent.    In a word: boring.
0061922315|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book and finished it in two sittings, but the ideas it touches on will stay with me for far longer. There were so many ways I could relate to the characters in this book:  the complexity of a marriage over many years, the daily sacrifices involved in being a good mother, the challenges of raising children/adolescents who have their own identity. I appreciated the way that each of the characters had their own flaws and weaknesses to overcome, and had to struggle to do so.  I truly loved the ending: it was very authentic, but also very satisfying and uplifting. There is so much great material for discusssion in this novel, it would make a perfect book club pick.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|I read the bad reviews of this film but watched the DVD anyway.  The film was even worse than the reviews.  I think the worst thing about the film was that it ended quite abruptly without any resolution.  When the credits began to roll, I was left feeling clueless.         The film started out okay--the dialogue was alright and the acting was fine, and I was amused by Annette Bening's character.   However, after about the first half, the film went nowhere.       It lacked the sharpness of the original and the famous line (\\"There's a word for women like that...\\") was uttered within the first minute of the film and utterly wasted.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Nothing to say but this is a solid movie, visually as well as the story line.  Characters are well developed.  I personally love the way this film was shot. Another homerun by the Wachowski Brothers!
0307277453|2.0|I found the book confusing and not terribly riveting. Some of the stuff was interesting, but I found myself reading lots of sentences two or three times, trying to figure out what the author was getting at. I like reading pop science that isn't dumbed down, and this book certainly isn't dumbed down, but the writing just wasn't clear enough to draw me in. Stephen Jay Gould has a collection of essays which is much more accessible than this book if you're looking for an evolution primer.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney Houston has made a comeback in her singing career with the release of her latest title, I Look To You. She does an excellent job singing on this album, and her voice is still as beautiful as before. I don't know which of these songs could be considered hits, but every track on here is worth listening to. This was her first album since her Just Whitney title from 2002. Fans should get this and add it to their Whitney collection. Welcome back, Whitney!!<br />UPDATE as of March 3, 2012:<br />Sadly, this would be Whitney's last album. She passed away on February 11, 2012 at the age of 48, but those of us who are fans of hers will always be listening to her for years to come. That beautiful voice she had will always sing forever more from the wonderful music she gave us. We should also realize that she's singing joyfully on the other side.
B002OB9KPE|2.0|The Whirlwind<br /><br />OK, I think I've finally listened to this (at least the 1st disc) enough to have an opinion.  I know that with a lot of complex, progressive music it takes a number of listens before you \\"get it.\\"  I \\"get\\" The Whirlwind and I don't like what I get.<br /><br />The music is more of the same from the first 2 discs; not necessarily a bad thing, but its seems there's not much new here.  The biggest turn-off for me, though, is the religious BS that is the central \\"whirlwind\\" theme.  Come on already. Haven't we heard this about a billion times before?  It seems if you listened to a local Christian Contempory Rock radio station for a day (if you could stand it) and collected all the themes, symbolism, and imagery, you'd have basically what we have in The Whirlwind. We get it already!<br /><br />On the positive side: the melodies are rather catchy, as we've come to expect.  The bass sounds great, and on this disc, really stands out.  The recording is as you'd expect and it really sounds like they're all putting 110% into their playing.<br /><br />But alas, after a number of listens this one gets shelved.  I think this is my jumping off point for Transatlantic. Thanks guys. It's been a nice ride, but this is where I get off.<br /><br />Oh, and who ever told Roine Stolt he could sing. Jeeze.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|First saw this OnDemand, then bought it from Amazon and watched it again.  Plan on enjoying Rome plenty of times more...  This definitely takes some of the polish off of Rome in antiquity and puts the gut-wrenching, filthy, deceitful and complicated reality into a usually flawed and too-pretty history of a culture oft-misrepresented.  HBO has really done a beautiful job of creating this compelling series.  At times gut-wrenching and disturbing, and then at other times touching and wistful.  Magnificent.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|This movie starts out with a gruesome first five minutes that are difficult to watch.  I nearly pulled the disk at that point, but I stuck it out and I'm glad I did.  It starts with peaceful home life, Gerard Butler with his daughter.  Next, the doorbell rings, and a pair of home invaders break in, stab him, kill and rape his wife (in that order) and then kill the daughter.  There, you know how it starts and you can skip the first five minutes.  Spare yourself.  Next, it appears to follow the standard revenge fantasy.  One criminal gets the death penalty, but the other escapes with a light sentence due to a fairly contrived DNA mixup and a set em free judge.  It is at the execution where this film sets itself apart.  Suffice it to say that the execution goes wrong, and the accomplice meets his grizzly fate shortly thereafter.  This leaves another 90 minutes after the revenge has been extracted.<br /><br />Butler then gets himself carted off to prison and it is there where he really starts to make life difficult for those who bungled the prosecution of the men who killed his family, elected officials, and the city of Philadelphia in general.<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen is a taught and engrossing thriller with a point to make (and I'm being vague so as not to spoil the twists).  Unfortunately, it does go a bit overboard with the gore and violence, and I took away one star for the first five minutes.  We didn't need to see that.  They hit him with a bat.  He could have blacked out and woke to find his family killed.  We didn't have to go through it with him.  It lost another star for some of the contrivances in order to set up the twists.  Nevertheless, the contrivances are forgivable insofar as they lead to pretty good twists in the story.<br /><br />Give it a try (but skip the first five minutes).  This is VERY rated R, so make sure the kids are at grandma's when you watch!
B002YIHO7I|3.0|I think it's fair to say every bona fide Sade fan has a mental list of their albums in order of greatness.  The band have made it easy for us; although having a career that spans more than 25 years they are only just releasing their sixth studio album.      However maybe it's also fair to say that very few would choose Lover's Rock as the high point in the band's career so far.  After having waited eight years since 1992's superb Love Deluxe, Lovers Rock elicited mixed feelings from the Sade faithful.  For every dizzying peak (`Somebody Already Broke My Heart', `King of Sorrow', `Slave Song') there was an underwhelming trough.  The album saw the band play around more with folk and blues, the outcome being hit and miss.    Fast forward ten years to Soldier of Love and we find an album that in standard and sound, lies somewhere in the middle of Love Deluxe and Lovers Rock - perhaps the record Sade would have made if the gap between the two hadn't been so long.  Speculation about the direction Sade would take started in earnest with the release of the Hip Hop/R&B-friendly title track.  This was a tactical move on the band's part; `Soldier of Love' would get the heads of a new generation of listener nodding whilst giving their established fanbase a little of what they have come to appreciate so much.  It turns out that the single was a feint, perhaps to get the clubs and DJs on board; it bears little resemblance to anything else on this diverse album.  In all other respects the trademark spacious arrangements and light-touch production remains.  Sade continues to exist on that unique self-made musical plain of theirs.    Vocally, after a slight dip on Lovers Rock, Sade herself is back on top form, thankfully losing that curious nasality evident on the fifth album.  Her signature phrasing remains like a faithful friend and her harmonies dissolve tastily on the tongue.  Sounding as pensive and soul-stirring as ever, it's always a pleasure to hear Ms Adu's rich contralto/tenor do what only she can.  What is more, there are several tracks on Soldier of Love to remind us of what has kept so many Sade aficionados happy for all these years.  `Skin' would have sat very comfortably on Love Deluxe as would have the beautifully haunting `Safest Hiding Place'.  Both will undoubtedly soon take their position amongst Sade's other timeless tunes, as will the delicious `The Moon and The Sky', the title track and slow-burner `Morning Bird'.    Nevertheless, just like Lover's Rock, where Sade's most recent output seems to come adrift slightly is with the country and blues numbers.  It's not that these styles per se are culpable as that they're not the best vehicles for showcasing Sade at their songwriting optimum.  `In Another Time' for instance and its conscientious, empowering message about overcoming the effects of unspecified abuse is conceptually admirable.  However the execution borders on the bland.  Time and again Sade has married profound lyrics with irresistible melodies, yet on songs such as the aforementioned and `Be That Easy' they don't quite get the chemistry right.  In addition these tracks have a lead-balloon effect on the flow and continuity of Soldier of Love dragging down the overall quality.  I half-wished a couple of them had been left off the record altogether; it would have been a good deal better for it.    Then there are the songs that fall somewhere in between such as `Bring Me Home' and the pop-reggae potential single `Babyfather'.  These are catchy, enjoyable numbers (if you ignore the irritating faux-patois BGVs on `Babyfather') that would be highlights on some other contemporary albums.  On the other hand for a band of Sade's calibre they are comparatively ordinary next to their best work.    There are still echoes on Soldier... of Sade's penchant for clever, multi-faceted lyrics.  On the excellent `Skin' for example, a song about disengaging oneself from an unhealthy emotional entanglement, there's an appealing ambiguity about the line...    `Now as I begin to wash you off my skin, I'm gonna peel you away cos you're not right within'.    Or on `Bring Me Home' the abstract but thought-provoking imagery evoked by...    `...The small step I need to take is a mountain stretched out like a lazy dog...'    That said, these illustrations notwithstanding Sade have shown greater lyrical dexterity on past projects than that displayed as a whole on Soldier...    At the risk of sounding like a begrudged fan that refuses to keep up with the changing faces of Sade's music, Ms Adu and band were once the purveyors of remarkable albums; start to finish certified classics in their own right.  Now they seem content just to make good rather than great records (which to be candid, will suffice given the current state of the market).  I recently heard a journalist and lifelong Sade fan, comment that if the band is going to spend so much time away, they should work harder on the material than the most recent albums suggest.  Maybe the lengthy sabbaticals between releases reflect Sade's reluctance to return at all, knowing that they reached their zenith long ago.    By some distance, Soldier of Love is superior to Lovers Rock and a more consistent work.  Nonetheless, after yet another ludicrously long wait I really wanted to love Soldier... - instead I'll just have to settle for liking it quite a bit.    Sade's back catalogue is impressive enough to keep fans loyal and awash with nostalgia.  I hope it's not this same nostalgia that is clouding my judgment but it appears the days of the era-defining Sade album are long gone.  They are a band who have earned their stripes and have nothing left to prove. The result is that Soldier of Love is a fine, though not entirely life-changing, addition to the canon.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|The element of freedom is another great album from the very talented A. Keys.     This is actually her best album since her debut. You can listen to this from beginning to end and get lost in the element of freedom. The only track I skip is \\"Put it in a love song\\". Beyonce should have kept that track for her own album because it seems misplaced and definitely was not needed on this album. With lyrics like \\"say you love me, then text me on my cell phone\\" is just out of place on this classic album.      The best songs are:    - Love is blind  - Try sleeping...  - That's how strong my love is  - Love is my disease  - Unthinkable    And my favorite song is \\"How it feels to fly\\". Great album!

B002U0KHMY|5.0|I finally caught this show late in the season and couldn't get enough; now I need to start at the beginning so I'm ready for the DVD set now. The reviews for White Collar are positive because they can't be anything but that. I loved Robert Wagner in It Takes a Thief, and I loved Hardcastle and McCormick. For me, White Collar combines the two with the \\"bad\\" suave, charming and intelligent thief being directly under a lawman's watchful eye. The premise for the show isn't new but the drama itself is very fresh. I call this my guilty pleasure because I honestly couldn't turn the channel when I laid eyes on Neal. I was wowed by Matt Bomer's look and Neal Caffrey's charm and wit. However, any drama with a great mix of characters pleases me immensely and White Collar certainly has a fantastic array of characters, starting with Neal and Peter (expertly acted by Tim DeKay) and moving right on down the line. The writing is usually nicely twisted with just the right turns -- though the season finale was not a surprise, it was, nonetheless, done quite dramatically. Admittedly, I don't always quite follow every case very well but I get it enough to stay interested (okay, I guess that's still because of those blue eyes and sophisticaed charm). I also must point out that the relationship of Peter and Elizabeth is extremely pleasing to me. Too often marriage is not portrayed well or intelligently in TV dramas and the way these two relate is as comfortable and right as a good, worn pair of jeans or favorite shoes. I also enjoy the relationship of Elizabeth to Neal. My interpretation of Peter's relationship to Neal is almost that of a big brother (at least, that's what's developing). Elizabeth might then be a big sister. It's a drama with everything right, including that while it may insinuate a bit of morality that I don't think is adequate, it is, as others have said, a \\"clean\\" show. Clean and yet completely interesting. Ah...see...it CAN be done. White Collar does it so very well!All the other quality shows I have enjoyed seem to be failing to keep an audience and stay on, so I'm calling White Collar my new favorite and I do hope it sticks around for at least a couple years if not longer.
006621131X|5.0|\\"Just Kids\\" is a touching soulful story of Patti Smith's life with Robert Mapplethorpe. Mapplethorpe was one of our most provocative artists known and famous for his being adept in achieving new milestones in photography, showing a unique quality and classic aesthetic of gay lifestyle and sexuality. Smith is well-known for her music, unique and often beautiful lyrics and poetry during the punk rock era. \\"Just Kids\\" draws on the very colorful scenic art environment in New York City during the late 60's through the 80's.  It also describes a story of the difficulties encountered by both Robert and Patti when they were first starting out as artists, being destitute and poor and shows their innovation towards their art and their drive to succeed. As their story unfolds in this book, there are many period photographs that provide further enrichment. The book ends with Robert Mapplethorpe's death from AIDS, tearfully. For anyone interested in either Smith or Mapplethorpe, this book is a must read.  It is insightful as it is beautiful.  Daniel S. Berger MD
0312370849|5.0|This novel is about the tremendous sin of the Shoah and the complicity of those French people who went along with the Nazis to murder thousands of children, as well as mothers and fathers, held in the Velodrome d'Hiver in July 1942 and then shipped to die at Auschwitz.  As the beginning quote implies, it is about the harm done by closing one's eyes to evil.  But even more than that, it is about secrets, kept for fear of hurting others, and how keeping such secrets often does more harm than the painful truth itself.     Julia, an American, marries into a French family and discovers, through researching the story of the Vel d'Hiv, that this family has an intimate connection to Sarah, one of the children who was held there.  The story of this connection is gradually revealed and its revelation exposes the rifts within the family itself.  Some welcome the truth, but some would rather have kept their eyes closed.  Marriages are broken - not necessarily by the secret itself, but by people's reactions to the truth and the interaction of deeper values which have been held in a delicate balance by the silence.      There are also those whose eyes were open at the time and who dared to risk their lives by helping Sarah live.  Their lives are scarred as well.  Such stories are familiar to us from many Holocaust survivor memoirs, but Tatiana de Rosnay has brought one particular child's fictional experience to vivid life in an unforgettable way.  The story spans several countries and generations, and despite much tragedy, it ends well, with two people deciding that the pain of open eyes is balanced by the joy of truly knowing and sharing another's deep experience.      This is a marvelous book, not to be missed.  Also check out this link...to a memorial in Square Adolphe Chérioux...(...)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I was shocked after watching this documentary based on the industrialized food system. I recommend it to all of my friends because I think everyone needs to know the truth about the food they are consuming. It has changed my life. We now avoid feed-lot meat and buy mostly organics. Every minor change will make a difference. I truly believe that everyone deserves high-quality food and the truth should not be hidden from us. By watching this movie, you will educate yourself and then make your own decisions. Don't worry, it is not hard to watch like some PETA footage.

B000QCS8TW|1.0|We are introduced to a lot of characters, each with their own sub-plot, and you agonize over the ones that you don't care for. Unfortunately the story just gets bogged down with all this stories and all the characters have things going bad for them, none of them have a break. How can each of the main characters threaten the others if things are going sour for them; it makes no sense. After a while you just give up trying to cheer for one of the characters and don't care,  all the knights are dumbasses, all the kings are arrogant and idiots, the only smart ones are the dwarf or the enuchs, just not charming at all. Bought the second book but just couldn't stomach it any more.

B0034GK7DM|5.0|A most impressive debut album. It seems country music may have found an artist worthy of carrying the torch. A true country album from start to finish. It is in my opinion the best release since George Strait's It Just Comes Natural. I've listened straight through the cd at least 20 times by now. Not a bit of filler on this record. The stand outs are Someday when im old, This far from memphis, I cant love you back, leavin a lonely town, and roll with it.     If you want a true country record that you wont want to take out of your cd player, buy Easton Corbin. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
630460288X|4.0|This is a great movie with plenty of action and enough comic relief to keep it from being too dark. The DVD itself however is a mess. I have been through several copies over the years and they all have the same problem. The layout of the disk defaults to playing the movie with director's commentary on and the setup menu has no effect at all. You have to have a button on your remote that toggles audio after movie starts. I have four players and only one has this feature.
B000XYNFD2|4.0|I recently purchased this watch after doing an \\"emergency\\" buy of its \\"little brother\\" 8926 at an airport jewelry store.  I paid a lot more at retail (and in an airport) for the 8926 than I could have online...but as I say, it was an \\"emergency\\" purchase, because I had forgotten my Rolex Date-just that day and needed a watch.  Not wanting to spend \\"Rolex\\" prices for my \\"emergency\\", I asked the sales person to show me a \\"cost-effective\\" automatic.  I came away with the 8926.  I liked the 8926, but was disheartened that it didn't have the ability to \\"hack\\" the second hand when setting the time. (Stop the second hand to synchronize with another clock precisely).  This led me to researching Invicta and the 8926.  That led me to finding the 9937, and its far better specification.  Of course, you can pick up the 8926 for about 1/3 the cost of the 9937, so you be the judge in comparing values.  For me, the hack ability, along with quite a few other differences was compelling enough for me to get the $300 version...<br /><br />The 9937 is a nice watch, and I'm happy with my purchase.  But in researching, I came across quite a bit of what I'll call \\"misinformation\\".  It seems that Invicta has changed some of the specs on this watch over the last few years, so you should check to make sure you know what you're getting.<br /><br />Let's start with the crystal.  Numerous entries here on Amazon (be they 9937c or 9937OB) show a sapphire crystal.  This is not true for the most recent versions of this watch.  It is actually a \\"Flame Fusion\\" crystal, which is a combination Mineral crystal + Sapphire coating, fused together.  Invicta claims this is BETTER than a sapphire crystal, and has moved to this for most of their \\"better\\" class watches.  I can't speak to the validity of that claim, but can say the crystal looks great, and seems to be pretty rugged.  After a week of daily wear, I have no scratches and the watch still looks perfect.  Just be aware if you are not purchasing a used item, you are getting a flame-fusion crystal and NOT a sapphire crystal.<br /><br />Next is the movement.  You'll find plenty of references to an ETA movement in the 9937, and how it is a huge improvement over the Myota movement in the 8926.  Again, the most recent versions of this watch do not use ETA, but rather a Selita movement.  That is where the \\"26 jewels\\" comes from.  I've heard grumblings that there were problems with the original Selita movement, but those problems are supposedly corrected in this latest version 9937.  Again from my perspective, I have only a week to go by, but the movement seems to wind well (no power reserve problems at all), and my 9937 is only running about 6 seconds fast/24 hrs.  That's not too bad, and I'll wait to see what it's like after a month or so.  In the meantime, I can live with 6sec fast a day.  Oh, and yes, the Selita does allow you to \\"hack\\" and stop the second hand.  Just know, whether Selita or ETA, both are an improvement over the Japanese Myota movement in the 8926 and other \\"lower end\\" Invicta automatics.<br /><br />The 8296 I bought has the \\"scalloped\\" bezel, while this 9937c has the coin edge.  The coin edge is DEFINITELY much easier to turn, both because of the grip that the coin edge allows, as well as the bezel itself on the 9937 seems to simply move easier.<br /><br />\\"Cyclops\\": There is no question after reading reviews and seeing pictures of the 9937OB, that Invicta changed this on later models too.  The cyclops on my 2010 9937c is most definitely NOT as strong a magnification as on the previous models.  Some have suggested this might be due to the \\"flame-fusion\\" crystal as compared to sapphire on the older models.  I really can't say, I can just say that on my 9937c, the magnification is about the same as the 8926.  However, in comparing the two, it seems to me the dates on the 8926 are actually a little \\"bolder\\" font than on my 9937.  It is actually a little harder to read the dates on my 9937c than on my8926.  Not bad enough to bother me, but enough for me to give this a 4 star rating instead of a 5.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'm so far very happy with the 9937c.  I really don't think you can come close to finding as nice an automatic watch with all the features in the 9937 for ~$300.  I was thinking of getting a Tag, and now I absolutely won't.  This is a great value.  I'm glad I found Invicta.  I prefer automatic watches over their battery operated brethren, and have often commented that somebody needed to make a decent $100-$300 automatic for everyday use.  This is the first I've seen that I actually like the watch and it's styling.  And for $300 you can't beat it.t enough for me to give this a 4 star rating instead of a 5.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|While Tim Burton's rather shameless breakdancing ripoff of The Looking Glass Wars and American McGee's Alice has been shaking up the box office, you cannot deny the classic visual ecstacy of the 1951 Disney animated movie. I'm really suprised that Disney didn't bother giving the live-action sequal/reboot a different title, at least to seperate it from the original. Although the more recent film seemed like Disney was just rehashing their Return To Oz premise but with Lewis Carroll's work. But, it is still impossible not to enjoy their classic first shot at it.<br /><br />Taking place in England(probably in the late-19th Century), young Alice is bored out her mind listening to her sister trying to teach her history. She then follows a slightly anthropomorphic White Rabbit down a hole, but instead of ending up in Bugs Bunny's place, she enters a \\"dimension of sight and sound\\". After having emotional problems with a chatty doorknob, she washes up on the shores of Wonderland. She's then thrust into a caucas race, forced into a dream sequence by pushy twins, wrecks the Rabbit's house, and gets pestered by pushy flowers, all while having some serious height issues. Fortunately, a poetic caterpillar gives her some good mushrooms(?), and Alice manages to stabilize her size. The enigmatic Cheshire Cat then leads her to the highlight of the movie, the Mad Tea Party(you can't not love the Doormouse freaking out!). After a little more wandering around amongst the bizarre forest animals, Alice does something that most Disney heroines do, and realizes that her own world was better after all, and decides to try and get home. The Cheshire Cat shows up again and leads her to the loudmouthed Queen of Hearts who has a serious decaptiation fetish. Instead of getting her head chopped off, Alice is given the weirdest trial outside of Judge Judy. She then proceeds into the craziest Benny Hill-styled chase in animated film history, and wakes up because the whole thing was just a dream(or was it?).<br /><br />For the lucky 13th of Disney's full-length cartoon movies, this broke alot of molds for them. First off, it was actually a meltdown of more than one book, while being mostly from the Alice In Wonderland book, there are segments from Through The Looking Glass too, but they manage to bring it together in a coherent way, which is suprising considering the source material. The other great aspect of it was their use of allowing the visual elements and music tell most of the story. It was to date their most colorful and lively animated movie to be released, only succeeded by Sleeping Beauty. While it isn't out to ram some overly-Christian morals down your children's throats like most Disney films, it remains as fun family feature, and one of the best cartoons to get totally stoned to!For the lucky 13th of Disney's full-length cartoon movies, this broke alot of molds for them.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Now my awareness of the Gorillaz comes primarily from their debut single [[ASIN:B000059ZBX Clint Eastwood]] which,while very good could've easily pegged them as a puffed up trip hop band and,at the time that song came out the music world was in no shortage for that kind of music. This being only three albums into their career has really altered my opinion of that. Where trip hop itself has often very muted elements of funk in it as it is this album showcases music that is both inspired strongly by 70's and 80's funk and hip-hop and if you need to make a comparasin this would land more in a catagory with Gnarls Barkley than...say Massive Attack. Even so,as with both those bands Gorillaz truely have a sound all their own and in the end this album only serves to expand on what they already had set up from the outset. of course the fact Danger Mouse is changing hands between Gorillaz and Gnarls Barkley might explain some of the crossover of flavors here. The orchestral intro that opens the album is actually very bright and melodic and serves to bring you into the albums world,which is lyrically very metaphorical and picturesque-kind of big words but the only ones I can use to describe how this impacts on me anyway. \\"Welcome To The World Of The Plastic Beach\\" is pretty much a flat out funk blowout with Snoop Dogg's rap,and the fact he too has been going in a similar direction with his own music a good marriage of two artists seeking the same basic world. Getting together both Mos Def and Bobby Womack to participate vocally on \\"Stylo\\",a very brooding kind of 80's electro dance-funk is a potent reminder not only of the musical world Mos Def came into as a rapper but in which Bobby Womack made his musical comeback,rather than focusing on his more commonly known arena in the 70's. \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\" features De La Soul in a very witty tune using samples of old TV commercials and with no irony lost as the lyric explores a very stream of consciouness theme revolving around a comparasin between general life and breakfast cereals,from the sound of it. \\"Sweeptakes\\" has Mos Def taking on a similar concept where \\"Cloud Of Unknowing\\" features Bobby Womack again in a more atmospheric concept. This album is chocked full of great songs with a lot of that newfound funk element and everything and I could spend all day reviewing each one but,for lack of space those are the albums highlites. I can only hope this represents only part of a first phase in what will be a long and musically fullfilling future for the Gorillaz.me revolving around a comparasin between general life and breakfast cereals,from the sound of it. \\"Sweeptakes\\" has Mos Def taking on a similar concept where \\"Cloud Of Unknowing\\" features Bobby Womack again in a more atmospheric concept.

B003162R7E|5.0|Over the years many people,namely Alan Douglas had tried to compile this material by adding other musicians and altering some of the sounds. This album presented a good chunk of that material the way Jimi originally recorded it. All throughout his career Jimi was always looking to find a new place to take rock and the blues to new places and how to restructure his sense of harmony and rhythm. And with [[ASIN:B00328G4XY Electric Ladyland]] and especially[[ASIN:B000002UVX Band Of Gypsys]] Jimi was really make big inroads in that area,concentrating more on groove and musical invention as opposed bled together psychedelic sounds that were creating moods for a spesific things.  All it's going to take is one listen to songs such as \\"Freedom\\",Izabella\\",Dolly Dagger\\",\\"Ezy Ryder\\",\\"Stepping Stone\\",\\"Astro Man\\",\\"Straight Ahead\\" and \\"Room Full Of Mirrors\\" that Jimi has in a sense come full circle. As a veteran of R&B session bands backing up the likes of the Isley Brothers he was carefully laying down rhythms now that had less to do with loose psychedelic guitar solos and down to chunky vamps and tight grooves with the likes of Billy Cox and Buddy Miles,both of whom were on the same wavelengh at the time. Funk author Ricky Vincent once pointed out that Jimi's songs such as \\"Purple Haze\\" and such weren't exactly catching on with the black R&B audience of it's day because the blues oriented end Jimi was exploring was somewhat removed from the emmerging Afro American music culture of the day. So here you find that Jimi is now in an environment with Norman Whitefield and Funkadeleic/Eddie Hazel who were both taking their groove in the same direction Jimi had started them out on by bringing the newer funk music closer into sync with rock elements and showing them how,in the right hands they could survive together. The songs \\"Angel\\" and \\"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun\\" don't really have anything to do with the more psychedelic sounds of \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" and are more straight forward,soulful romantic swells of melody and harmonic invention. If your a fan of funk,R&B and soul music as opposed to fusions of psychedelic hard rock this will be the kind of Jimi Hendrix music you'll find easier to get into. If you like both...well your in for a treat. My favorite song on the album is actually \\"Earth Blues\\",heard as the theme song to [[ASIN:B00004Y7ER Rainbow Bridge]]-a film featuring Hendrix and showcases this sound even better than the fantastic proceedings with it's gospel/rock female backup vocals and socially aware conciousness. If you listen carefully Funkadelic would later mine a similar groove on the title song to their 1976 album [[ASIN:B001C3EHRQ Hardcore Jollies]]. There are a handful of songs here that point more to Jimi's blues oriented past but they are also different,pointing more at the singular wit of the genre as opposed to clished whininess,showing he has a very full understanding of the genre culturally than some others even at that time. Perhaps this album says more about Jimi's true musical heard than any of his albums with the Experience and in this addition this music should be a cornerstone of anyone whose music collection crossess bridges between classic rock and 70's funk music.e straight forward,soulful romantic swells of melody and harmonic invention.

0307454541|3.0|The translation is TERRIBLE, with poor word choices, hackneyed phrases, and mixed metaphors.  Changing the title from the original Swedish \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" is a bad mistake.  AND the book needs some serious editing, to excise an overly long and uninteresting beginning and to punch-up the story when it degenerates into a lazy list of email exchanges toward the end.<br /><br />But even with these flaws, I found \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" an interesting enough read to justify my time.<br /><br />For me, much of that interest comes from the female protagonist in the story, who might be severely emotionally damaged but is also strictly moral and thus strangely appealing. She seems to be just about the only character that's well developed in the novel.  And even for her, the author clearly doesn't think we're smart enough to figure out the genesis of her underlying quirks by ourselves, as he feels compelled to explain to us about mid-novel that she suffers from Asperger syndrome.  Duh!  Really?  What a shock, NOW her behavior all makes sense (sorry, that was sarcasm there).<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book enough to give it 3 stars, I don't understand all the enthusiasm and praise that the book has gotten.  You want a quirky, broken, female protagonist and a ripper of a who-done-it story?  Read \\"Dark Places\\" by Gillian Flynn, which I found to be a similar yet FAR superior novel.<br /><br />If you're looking for a relatively interesting read, that WILL get you guessing about \\"who-done-it\\"... or you want to know what your friends are talking about when they discuss Lisbeth Salander... go ahead and read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  Just be ready for some uneven patches, and an annoyingly bad translation (have you dictionary ready to look up \\"gallimaufry\\", when you encounter it).
1593081154|4.0|I bought and read this version(version #2) of Frankenstein first, then went on to read the original version Mary Shelley wrote, before she made changes to the story years later. (Oxford World's Classics is the original version, or any version with the inclusion \\"a Modern Prometheus\\" in the title. This Barnes and Noble Classics version is the later changed version.)  I was glad I read both, and in that order, because when I read the original version (which was by far my favorite), my appreciation for the brilliant nuggets I found had been edited out in version #2 was heightened.  I wish I had checked this version out from the library, and bought the original version.<br />The thoughts and motives of the characters in the version #2 suffer from the incongruity of the later changes to the story, while in the original version they flow with more clarity.  Some wonderful food for thought permeates the reflections of the characters in the original version, that is left out in the later.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it was a great book club pick!  Nothing puts me off more than the \\"horror\\" genre... or the versions of this story depicted in the movies.  But I found this to be totally different from what I expected, written with a reflective and thoughtful voice, packed with fascinating themes to think about.  Some people say the writing style is difficult, but I didn't find it hard to read.  I found it rather enjoyable for its intelligent, almost poetic (some would say stuffy) way of putting things, without being too much work to understand in the context of the story (but that will vary from person to person depending on your taste.)  Mary Shelley was clearly an intelligent and well-read person, and that is reflected in this story.  I love that it spurred me to learn more about other writings and ideas that were referenced in this work, and the philosophical ideas and discussions that circled in her group, that are still relevant today, and which they tied into similar threads of thought ranging from Greek mythology to Milton's Paradise Lost (which I was unfamiliar with until I read this book.)  A few minutes spent on wikipedia learning about Prometheus, Milton's Satan, or reading in an introduction about Mary Shelley's life and circle of friends and family and their part in the romantic movement, really enrich the reading of this book.  It is a book you can get something from with just a casual reading, but can really find some good stuff if you feel like diving in deeper.ads of thought ranging from Greek mythology to Milton's Paradise Lost (which I was unfamiliar with until I read this book.)

0307341569|5.0|A very well written and well structured novel... I just love Flynn's voice and her shifts of perspective from first to third person. I also find the protagonist (Libby Day) to be interesting (another reviewer here characterized her comments as \\"sardonic\\" and I think that fits perfectly) and, though she's very obviously damaged, I found her strangely likable.    Flynn held my interest and cleverly dropped details to lead me to believe that any one of the several characters in the novel could have been responsible for the crime. For me, Dark places was definitely a page turner.  Having said that, I don't think the ending was brilliant, but I enjoyed the book overall so very much that I didn't mind an ending that I found to be a bit of a stretch.     Dark Places was a novel that stayed with me, kept me thinking about it even after I had finished reading.  This lead me to read Flynn's first novel (Sharp Objects).  You can definitely see Flynn's growth from Sharp Objects (which is written in a very similar voice) to Dark Places.  So, if you liked Sharp Objects I think you'll REALLY like Dark Places.    Highly recommended.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar. The story - predictable, camp, simple. Earth, its military-industrial complex, wants to get its hands on the minerals of beautiful planet Pandora. On Pandora lives a peaceful race of extraterrestrials, in harmony with their environment and in peace with themselves. With colonial arrogance and hypocrisy humans want to get the riches of the planet, seeing the natives as ignorant and underdeveloped.   Before raping the planet a scientific study on the natives is undertaken nevertheless. For the researchers to really be able to mingle with the natives artificial natives, Avatars, are created and remotely controlled by humans. One of these humans is a soldier who had lost his legs before. Now, when controlling the Avatar, he finds new freedom of spirit and body.   He 'goes native', falling in love with a beautiful girl. He manages to rouse the natives to fight against the invaders and finally beats them.   So far so good. Kitschy, ecologically and politically correct, naturally with a big battle, huge explosions and superhuman deeds in the end, as it seems to be 'de rigeur' for almost any new movie nowadays.  The saving grace of the movie is certainly the masterful use of 3D and computer animation. The reality of the world of Pandora is overwhelming, each computer generated animal is believable, each and every plant is more than just a prop, there seems to be an inherent logic in this Pandora ecosystem. All fits together well, Pandora is a real world as far as it can go in the cinema. Not a world I would like to live in though. Not because I am afraid of all these flesh-eating monstrosities living in that world. No. Rather because the defining element of the planet of Pandora seems to be bad taste, kitschy colors and 'glow in the dark' beauty. I hoped that the 1970s 'glow in the dark' artistic atrocities would never be revived, but, alas, these hopes have been in vain. In Avatar everything glows in the dark, floats gently in the night etc. etc.  Nevertheless Avatar defines a new period in movie making. Never has 3D been so natural, such an inherent part of the movie. After leaving the cinema I marvelled how one could see this movie not in 3D and still enjoy it. There are no '3D effects', no balls thrown at the viewer, no arrows aimed at me and all this. Now, 3D is here simply part and parcel of the movie.  And thus I recommend the movie, not for its story, not for its beauty, but by creating a new class of visuals and by being believable in the world it creates.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|This is a beautiful movie to look at on the screen. All the creatures, the setting, the colors, the makeup, the special effects.  This was all absolutely splendid.  However, the story was another comic book come to the screen of good vs. evil with earth's military being the evil.  The commander for the military is every bad cliche about a military man you've ever seen.  At two hours in, I gave up.  The over the top military aspect took over the story and I had had enough. Cameron has always made visually arresting movies.  He is a master at handling extravaganzas.  However, I am really tired of his simplistic good vs. evil story lines and the ensuing battles between the two.  Oddly enough, this reminded me of DANCES WITH WOLVES but without Kevin Costner's light handed humor added into it, which was a great leavening factor.  If you love art, you will love looking at this but two hours of looking at it is more than enough. Three is really pushing it.

B00005V9HH|5.0|What do five criminals in a lineup do? 5 criminals in a lineup? This starting point already sets the tone of this movie. And it only gets better from here. This movie describes in flashbacks how a group of 5 criminals is gently or not so gently persuaded to do a job for the mysterious Keyzer Söse, a master criminal, the great puppet player. Every cut offers some new take on reality, offers yet another look at the interpersonal dynamics between the main characters and always leaves the viewer with the feeling that something is still amiss, like that puzzle piece which nearly but not perfectly fits, this nagging doubt in the back of ones head about a story too perfect to be true.   And thus we follow this gang on their path towards self destruction. Slowly all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, slowly one realizes that each and every move of them had somehow been preordained, that even in their rebellion they were still following the masterplan of Keyzer Söse.   The final scene, in which the agent interviewing Kevin Spacey manages to raise some of the obscurantist veil covering the whole real story is memorable and marvelous - and I will not say anymore here, not to spoil the movie for others.

B000Y7U98W|2.0|The camera angles, framing (how close we are to the subjects), editing and composition of the internal shots are way, way over done.  I felt like I was watching someone parodying a Paul Greengrass film (as if such awfulness like the Bourne sequels isn't bad enough strait-up) while borrowing further stylistic aesthetics from better director's like Michael Winterbottom.  Shot after shot is partially obscured, dutched, lens flared, and/or is too close... and scenes continue for the most part with more subsequent shots that are just random variations on these ones they began with.  We rarely have a sense of geography outside of what we can piece together like some kind of puzzle.  The cinematography and editing just call attention to themselves in Sunshine without lending emotional substance.  It does not aid plot development.  It does not \\"paint\\" our emotional response uniquely.  Just gimmick.  Again, I'm not talking about the effects or the externals, though one could make the case of the latter being neglected further by insufficient geographic lucidity.  I'll give a pass on that due to it succeeding in revealing the grandness of the ship's structure over successive, disparate scenes.<br /><br />Even more problematic is the lack of character development by showing strengths, weaknesses, insecurities, and joys.  We just kind of get thrown into this motley crew without being given any reason to care about them.  Sure, Earth is in trouble but considering it's in the future and we don't know what they're like back home, for all I know it's now just a planet of texting automatons not worthy of saving.  For that matter, this crew itself lacks maturity, professionalism, and many other attributes you find in pilots, astronauts, and accomplished scientists.  They whine & stress about dying, and argue like a bunch of junior high girls.  Before we know it, there's the formulaic plot devices reminiscent of Mission to Mars or Deep Core where one technical problem after another needs to be overcome in sequence as the characters are lost to attrition until only the final few remain.  This is fulfilled by such absurdities like airlocks needing to be manually triggered from within, even though there's a guy in a space suite that could stay behind so someone doesn't actually need to be left behind to die.  These are contrivances that such a weak script relies upon to propel us to further heights of suspense, and then finally an ending.<br /><br />I was hoping the smart story concept and painstaking effects would be matched with the substance at some point in the film to justify them.  Some patience.  Some interesting interpersonal dialogue.  Some genuine teamwork, compassion, and illustration of their acquired skills.  I felt no emotional investment.  Striking visuals and some droney, heavily-reverbed emo music can't fill in those gaps.  Turning up a knob that actually says \\"resonance\\" can't be such a crutch.  It could have augmented a better film, so I waited and watched.  Unfortunately, Sunshine takes a turn for the highly predictable, which I suppose Boyle tried to remedy by further gee-wiz obscuring post-production effects to make it more cryptic and interesting.  Well, it's certainly visually cryptic to a point, even perhaps welcome in making the gore more palatable, but the look on my face was probably one more of disappointment and amazement that *this* is what a Danny Boyle sci-fi outing turned out as.  I am admittedly shocked at how much I disliked this film.  My friends would ordinarily assume this would be right up my alley.  I loved Trainspotting.  I enjoy science fiction.

B001HN694K|3.0|The good news is that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, as a team, always dazzle - and this time is no exception. Effects are truly special: the Tweedles, Red Queen, and all the rest come across with utterly realistic surrealism. The initial fall down the rabbit hole has just the right roller-coaster sensation: scary, but not too scary. And the star power here - too many notables to name - means that acting talent will help smooth over bumps in the scripting. Then, Burton's inevitable dark note brought this closer to Dodgson's Alice than nearly any other. I expected this to supplant [[ASIN:6305779635 Svankmajer's]] peculiar fantasy or that amazing [[ASIN:B0000CG8I8 BBC version]] as my favorite.<br /><br />My favorites need not have worried. This movie offers fair adventure, a young heroine rising to heroic demands, a modern bit of rebellion against Victorian constraints, and delighfully bizarre fantasy. It just doesn't offer Alice as we knew her. Instead, Burton let Alice grow up, then placed her within a sequel to Lewis Carroll's originals. I always have reservations about modern writers collaborating posthumously with others no longer able to defend their work - and this just helps solidify that distrust.<br /><br />So, this movie presents an effect-filled romp, with some novel effects that I expect to see more of. It brings a modern rewriting to straight-jacketed Victorian sexism. It splashes the screen with amazing visuals (even in 2D). It just isn't Alice. Therein lies my disappointment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

Anyway on to Youtube we went and there it was a video clip of Serj, and the Orchestra doing a song called \\"Empty Walls\\", it looked and sounded superb.     A week later and after watching the DVD last nite and listening to the CD this morning, only one word to sum this one up... Outstanding. It is clear from the intro on the DVD that Serj is just so excited about doing his solo album live with an Orchestra (even his mum and dad are at the show!). (Evidently Serj spends a bit of time down here in New Zealand).    The performance is stellar, the Orchestra are in top form, the playing is flawless throughout. Serj's singing is just fantastic, such range, tone and emotion. Can't really recommend this one highly enough. The production (both audio and visuals are crystal clear).  Special mention also to Dan Monti who plays acoustic guitar and sings back up vocals, he is very very good.    Certainly one out of the blue (have to thank my good wife for this).  If this sounds remotely like your sort of stuff check out the Youtube clips and if there's a glimmer of \\"that actually sounds pretty good\\" - don't hesitate, it's a winner.

0307463745|5.0|As pretty much all of the other reviews state, REWORK is a great book with hundreds of excellent snippets of advice. The moral of the book is simple: do something you love, and keep it simple.<br /><br />37signals is known for their amazingly simple, effective software products, and this book clearly reflects that strategy. The book is split up into extremely short chapters, each with title that, in itself, contains great advice about business, product development, and mentality. The chapters explain in a blunt, forward, and insightful way what works, what doesn't, and how to avoid the pitfalls of normal business.<br /><br />If you're interested in writing your own software, running your own business, or just increasing your own productivity, this book is a MUST READ. I received the book earlier today, and couldn't put it down till I was done. I've been developing software for years, and this book has helped me realize several important things that I need to change.<br /><br />Thanks 37signals for this one, amazing work.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have known the story of Hachiko for years, and sometimes just thinking seriously about the story would bring tears to my eyes (yes, I am sensitive like that.) However, this film totally got under my radar when it first came out in the State. For some unknown reasons, this film, which features acclaimed director and actors, got a VERY limited release before going straight to DVD. Whoever made that decision should be kicked in the ass and fired. Fortunately, the film scored a decent screening in Thailand, my home country, just last week. My parents saw it and quickly told me about how they cried their eyes out at this movie. I was a bit skeptical at first. Why would a film of this quality become a straight-to-DVD when far worse movies manage to hit the cinema? In the end, I checked out the reviews in Amazon and IMDB before deciding to buy it. Apparently, Hollywood decision makers are really stupid...<br /><br />THIS FILM IS GOOD. For some of you who prefer more actions and a climax, this film might not be entirely for you, but it won't bore you out. For those who are hesitant about seeing a sad dog movie, you should take a chance. It isn't the usual Hollywood melodrama. Everything is played out subtly with a strong sense of just being an everyday life scene. To top that off, it features one of the best acting from Richard Gere. I might be biased from liking the actual story that the movie is based on, however, I usually dislike a cheesy dog movies or a movie that attempts too hard at being a tearjerker, and this film is neither of the two.<br /><br />Definitely some dollars well spent!
B002ZG97RE|2.0|WARNING SPOILERS!!!    Again I'll ask what was the point of this movie. I think the point of this movie was to make left wing people in Hollywood and around the United States feel better about themselves. There was no other point to this movie, the story was average and predictable at best, the acting was robot like, the directing was just bad. The only really good thing about this movie were the action and visuals. I'm going to say the same thing about about Green Zone I said about Avatar. Great action and visuals do not make a good movie.    Now you Obama lovers and left wing democrats calm down. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I have no party, and I really hate the way the political system works right now. All this movie does is point out facts most people should already know. The Bush administration lied to use about there being and active Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq, just like they lied about the terrorists from 911 being from there, when in fact most of them were from Saudi Arabia. Most people should already know this. Just like everybody should know Saddam Hussein was a terrible man who killed millions of his own people, and his government should have been overthrown. Hell back in the Gulf War we should have gotten ride of him then. The people of Iraq are better off without him in the long run. Most people out there should already know this, so again what was the point of this movie. Oh yes I forgot about the movie.    The story I shouldn't even have to go into. It's about the search for WMD's, and not finding any. The writers didn't care about the characters only the story, and it was still bad. The only good side to this story was that the writers tried to show the Iraqis perspective, which I did enjoy. It just wasn't enough to make this a good movie.    The acting was terrible and robot like. Matt Damon  was essentially Jason Bourne, and the movie kind of felt like a bad Bourne movie. The other American actors(Greg Kinnear, Amy Ryan, Brendan Gleeson and others) were like robots spouting off their lines. The only characters I actually felt for were the Iraq ones especially Freddy(Khalid Abdalla). His acting and character stole the movie for me.    The directing by Paul Greengrass was just plain bad. It was like he was directing a bad Jason Bourne movie.    Finally the action and special effects, the only good thing about this movie. They were admittedly good and riveting. The only problem is that you just don't care about any of the characters and who lives or dies.    Hollywood needs to stop making movies on Iraq, they suck at it. Stop standing on your soap box and come down to the rest of us. There are plenty of other issues and wars you could make movies about. For example I would love to see a movie about WWI. I know WWII is the popular war to make movies about, but I think making movie based on WWI would be good and a change of passe.    Now if you want to see good movies about Iraq, I would suggest only two. The first is Hurt Locker, and the second is Three Kings. Those two movies are truly great and worth watching.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I must confess I am a Jane Austen addict.  I have almost every version of Jane Austen's books set to film, tape and DVD.    This version of Emma shows another side of Emma as being more superior with a wicked, teasing grin.  Romola Garai captures Emma as she was meant to be in my opinion.    The British do a fabulous job again with the gorgeous scenery, fabulous clothing, and the estates of old English countryside bringing one into the time frame to share in the story.    No matter how many remakes there are, I will always love Jane Austen's stories as only the English theatre can create.  I highly recommend this version for your collection.
B002QB1910|2.0|When you listen to modern female \\"pop stars\\" with their interchangeable, simplistic, uninteresting and unoriginal \\"word songs\\" you don't know whether to laugh or cry.  I heard an old album recently - Songs to the Key of Life (Stevie Wonder) - and still marvel at the incredible originality and complexity of both lyrics and music.  This current swath of three note tunes (to quote Simon) serves as a wonderful antidote to anyone having trouble getting to sleep.      Many critics noted that not one single song is exceptional - from the underwater(?) PHOTOGRAPH (what happened in the sound studio?) to the absurd G4L with requisite bad grammar, \\"N\\" word - an absurd attempt at gaining \\"street cred\\". Russian Roulette, the \\"hit\\" (lol) is not only simple but simplistic.  Can anyone write a melody line anymore?      The whole thing sounds like \\"One Last Song\\", the aptly named final recording. Let me add that that the whole experience (which I was forced to endure in a long car ride) was not only banal but depressing.  If this is the future of \\"artists\\" then we are in for a long, bumpy ride.  Please, Rhianna, stop the moping and hire a new song writer.

0060922583|4.0|This book is the crowning achievement of the late Michael Talbot, mystic and science fiction writer whose short life ended in 1992 when he succumbed to leukaemia at the tragically young age of 38. \\"The Holographic Universe\\" is the only work by Talbot which most people have ever read or heard of, though he wrote other books on \\"the new physics\\" and on reincarnation. This book has been influential in popularising the holographic model of reality, postulated by the respected London University physicist David Bohm who originally hypothesised it to explain the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and other quantum anomalies, and separately by Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram to explain the many complex workings of the human mind.<br /><br />In \\"The Holographic Universe\\" Talbot takes the original models of Bohm and Pribram, backs up his thesis with the work of psychologists like Fred Alan Wolf, Stanislav Grov and others and extends the holographic model to postulate an all-embracing idea to explain: the nature of human experience and spiritual awareness, the nature of memory, the nature of time, near death experiences, paranormal phenomena of all kinds, multiple personality disorder and religious experience no less - and this list is by no means comprehensive. It's thought-provoking stuff with some good science but manages to be at the same time racy, absorbing and accessible to the non-science reader. This is quite a trick to pull off, but Talbot succeeds splendidly.<br /><br />Examples of strange and mysterious phenomena outside the classical Newtonian-Cartesian model abound, from people who see the human energy field to telepathy, stigmata, psychokinesis, clairvoyance, prophecy and spontaneous healing. Talbot's thesis tries to fit all these paranormal phenomena into the holographic model and largely succeeds.<br /><br />More scientifically literate readers, especially those versed in quantum theory, have used terms like `populist' and `shallow' to describe this book, but this criticism is only partly justified. The less educated reader may take Talbot's door-opening, paradigm-shifting thesis and investigate deeper and further into the physics underpinning the theory. It's not a scientific paper: it's a layman's book about a theory, written to sell and generate widespread popular discourse about its subject.<br /><br />Talbot does however exhibit the zeal of the young and over-eggs it a bit, coming across more as an evangelist for the hypothesis than an impartial investigator using the scientific method to arrive at a sustainable model of reality. The fact is, some of the underlying physics is not very thoroughly understood by the author and alternative interpretations of the anomalies found in quantum mechanics have gained stronger support from many in the scientific community in the two decades since the book was written. In the assessment of this reviewer however these developments do not invalidate this important book, and though imperfect and pushing a scientific model which is incomplete and may well soon be obsolete, reading it is still time well spent. Talbot was a good writer, is never dull, and knows how to make you think.<br /><br />It is interesting to speculate if, had Michael Talbot lived, he might have revised and deepened his thesis in the light of recent discoveries in quantum physics and developments in parapsychology into a more mature and serious work.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|LAC really thinks it is a better and more clever movie than it actually is.  In truth, it tries to emulate \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Seven\\" and a few other films by being a mash-up of those films.  The result is less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The direction is by-the-numbers and uninspired.  The script is cliche-ridden and needs a few draft revisions to make it a little fresher.<br /><br />MAJOR leaps in logic, geography, and timing.  (So-and-so character is heading back to a certain location, but the person who left long after he did from the same location manages to beat him there too easily..., etc).<br /><br />This film was shot during a very cold Philadelphia winter, and in one dialogue scene shot on an interior staircase in a courthouse, there is visible steam coming from the actors' mouths.  Looks as if the movie crew was granted access to the building during off-hours or a weekend but didn't agree to pay to have the heat turned on.<br /><br />There were a few twists to the genre in this film, but I found out later they were (probably) borrowed from a certain Japanese thriller from a few years ago.  Is there NOTHING original anymore?<br /><br />One thing in particular that made me chuckle:  Fairly early on in the film I was having trouble understanding some of Jamie Foxx's spoken dialog because he tends to swallow his words.  So I watched the rest of the film with the subtitles on.  During a scene where Gerard Butler's character is playing music from his iPod, the subtitle reads \\"[Jazz playing]\\".  The music was not Jazz --  it was the song \\"Eminence Front\\" by The Who.  But as if that weren't funny enough, a few moments later, after the film has cut away to another location and then returned to the iPod playing, the subtitles then read \\"[Funk playing]\\", but it is still the SAME SONG playing!  I didn't know (and I bet The Who's Pete Townshend didn't either) that the first half of the rock song \\"Eminence Front\\" is Jazz and the second half is Funk.  Boy, have my music genre identification skills been wrong for a lot of years!!<br /><br />Rent but don't buy.ion skills been wrong for a lot of years!!      Rent but don't buy.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|When a movie boasts the incredible feat of becoming the highest grossing picture of all time, ground-breaking visual effects, extremely favorable critical reception, and has a director that undoubtedly still believes himself to be \\"King of the world!\\", a person does wonder, \\"Is it really possible for a single movie to be that awesome?\\" That's the question that continued to nag at me until I finally got around to watching director James Cameron's (\\"Titanic\\") sci-fi/fantasy epic, \\"Avatar\\".    \\"Avatar\\" follows a paraplegic Marine, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), as he undertakes a mission for the government to assist in gaining possession of an extremely valuable mineral nicknamed \\"Unobtanium\\". Standing in the government's way is the indigenous populace of the planet Pandora, a cat-like alien race known as the Na'vi. To complete his mission, Jake must become one of the natives, gain their trust, and convince them to leave the only place they've ever called home. The problem is that the more Jake learns about the Na'vi, courtesy of his guide Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), the more he begins to lose sight of his objective; thus, putting not only his mission in jeopardy, but the very lives of the Na'vi.    Let's start by discussing the most pressing matter regarding this movie, in my mind... the visual effects work. Well, as much as I didn't want to admit it, James Cameron has managed to create one of the most realistic CGI worlds and people (the Na'vi) ever to be seen on the silver screen. Those that know me, heard me say many times that I doubted he would be able to make the eyes look right, as this has always been a trouble spot for CGI born characters. Not to mention, nine foot tall, blue, cat-like aliens interacting with live actors would be difficult to accomplish realistically.    Despite my misgivings, the folks at WETA Digital (visual effects house) along with the incredibly complicated motion-capture techniques that Cameron employed, have blown the lid off of what computer generated imagery has been able to accomplish thus far. From the smallest details (facial ticks, pores on the skin) to physical movements (walking, talking, fighting), and yes even the eyes, almost everything about these characters looks authentic.    As for the lush world of Pandora that the Na'vi inhabits, it is a world of beauty and wonder, and looks absolutely stunning. However, the creation of Pandora isn't nearly as big of an accomplishment as the characters. Realistic worlds have been created in several other movies prior to this one, perhaps not to this magnitude though. The bottom line is this movie represents a significant leap forward in the realm of CGI and officially sets a new standard for visual effects in movies.    Now, there was at least one flaw in the CGI that I spotted, and I would be remiss not to touch on that for a moment. Another issue that plagues visual effects, aside from life-like eyes, is creating realistic fire. For the most part, the fire and explosions looked fantastic, and one could be hard-pressed to find an actual flame or fireball that looked any more real. However, there was a moment where the character of Jake takes a stick to make a torch, and in that scene the fire on the torch looks horrible by comparison. Nothing about it looks even remotely true to life, and I was surprised that James Cameron would allow this less-than-stellar result in his otherwise visually stunning movie.    The story for \\"Avatar\\" is a fairly simple one. It's your basic undercover story, where the person sent to essentially spy on someone eventually either falls for their quarry or joins their cause, foregoing all other allegiances. The plot points play out in a fairly predictable manner, especially in the final 45 minutes when the battle over Pandora really begins to heat up. Even with the predictability of the story, I didn't really find that it detracted too much from the experience. Although, there were a few moments where the story became so telegraphed that you knew exactly when a certain aspect of this tried-and-true storyline would occur; in those moments, the predictability would become a little bit distracting.    While discussing the story, I did have some issues that chipped away at what many believe to be a nearly invincible movie. To be honest, I would have absolutely been enthralled by this movie and potentially heralded it as one of the greatest ever created if Cameron could have left his politics out of the entire affair.    For instance, a major dose of \\"Go Green\\" was threaded into the story, to the point that Cameron almost suggests that nature will fight back to defend itself if necessary (a theme borrowed from M. Night Shyamalan's \\"The Happening\\"). Then, there's the anti-military/war in Iraq and Afghanistan agenda that is woven into the obvious comparison of the Na'vi to the Native Americans. We get it, Hollywood doesn't support the war on terror and for the most part, it appears they don't support our troops either. What I don't get, is why these writers and directors think that audiences can't get enough of these political agendas in the media, so we need it to infiltrate our entertainment as well.    Also, the story does slow down in the middle portion when Jake is learning more about Pandora and the Na'vi. I understand that for the story to work Jake must integrate fully into their society and how they connect with the planet, but I don't believe this area of the movie needed to drag on as long as it did. After a while, I got the point that he's learning more and more, so the story could feel free to move along; however, James Cameron just hammers this segment into the audience to an almost exhausting degree. After spending so many years working on the story for this movie, as he waited for technology to catch up to his ideas, one would think that James Cameron could have perfected the script to the point that a lull never occurs. Oh well, it was just a thought.    If the aforementionedpart of the story had been shortened to some extent, plus had most of the environmentalist and anti-war propaganda been removed from the movie, the running time could have been trimmed by approximately 30 minutes and been much better for it. But, from Cameron's perspective, the man has a captive audience so the temptation to force his agendas down their collective throat is too good to pass up.    As for the cast of this movie, every one of them was extremely capable and showed more depth of character than one would typically expect from a science-fiction movie. Of course, to comment on the performances of the CGI characters is to presume that most of the performance was due to the motion capture of the various actors portraying the roles, and not the skill of some computer wizard in an office somewhere. At least, that's the approach I am taking with this aspect of the film.    In his first predominantly starring role, Sam Worthington (\\"Terminator: Salvation\\") shows more range than I thought him capable of delivering. That's not to say that he will be winning any Academy Awards for his acting prowess anytime soon, if ever. He does manage to squeeze out a few emotional outbursts that don't appear forced or uncomfortable for him. The reason this surprised me was because I wasn't sure if the man could react emotionally. Have you ever seen an interview with this guy? Anyways, even though he is allotted several opportunities to loosen up his typically stoic demeanor; for the most part, Sam appears most comfortable when working in an action sequence that requires little to no emotional output on his part. Let's face it, the guy knows his limitations, and is wise enough to take roles that strictly showcase his strong points.    As the other main character in the film, and also the member of the cast most worthy of mention, is actress Zoe Saldana (\\"Star Trek\\") as Neytiri. Her performance was one of the film's main keys to success, because aside from Jake, she is the only other character with which the audience really gets a chance to relate. Zoe imbues such heart and warmth into Neytiri that you forget you're watching a CGI creation rather than a real person. If an actress can bring a nine-foot tall, blue-skinned, cat-like alien to life in such a believable way, then she's done an excellent job in my book.    In the major supporting roles are Stephen Lang (\\"Tombstone\\") and Sigourney Weaver (\\"Aliens\\"). Stephen Lang obviously relishes every moment he appears in the film as the scheming Colonel Miles Quaritch. One minute you believe him to be the epitome of the great wartime military leader, but then he'll show his true malevolent colors as he seeks to destroy every living thing in his way. Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine exudes a no-nonsense, tough as nails attitude that belies her gentler, more caring side that she conveys only amidst the Na'vi. It's a shame that such a talented actress became so typecast by her role as Ellen Ripley in the \\"Alien\\" franchise, because she always manages to deliver top-notch performances and is an actress worthy of more and more quality roles.    Even though this film has become the highest grossing movie of all time, and boasts some of the most impressive visual effects one has ever seen; in the end, the movie is held back from the greatness it could have achieved. While \\"Avatar\\" is still a very solid, entertaining movie, James Cameron's desire to stand on too many soap boxes over the film's overly long duration causes the movie to fall short of its potential.    \\"Avatar\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality/brief nudity.

0784010501|4.0|Madonna has been a part of our public consciousness for almost three decades. Love or hate her, no one would argue that she is one of the biggest pop stars and icons of our time. There is just something so captivating about her. It's more than her talent (and unlike some of her detractors, I am a huge fan and I do believe that she is talented). It's more about her star quality, which consists of a mixture of ambition, charisma, nerve, and elusiveness. \\"Truth or Dare\\" is a daring documentary that truly captures the force of Madonna's compelling personality. We get to see many different facets of her persona: the boss, the narcissist, the passionate artist, the maternal figure. Of course, there are moments in the film that feel sort of staged and premeditated and intended to effect the viewer. But that just demonstrates the power of Madonna's postmodern vision. It constantly raises the question \\"Is this life, this is art, or both?\\" One constant theme of Madonna's work is to turn her life into a kind of performance art. She manages to do that brilliantly with \\"Truth or Dare\\". It's hilarious, it's entertaining, and (despite how \\"real\\" it is or not) it's very insightful.

The producer, director, and the wonderful cast all went above and beyond what might have been expected of them!  Jane Austin would have been proud!    I had seen this version of the movie more than once before I purchased it, and now that I have bought the standard DVD, I still find myself delighted every time I view it.  I have recommended it to my friends.  I give it my highest rating.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|As a classical singer and voice teacher myself, you may never suspect it, but I am crazy for Lady Gaga.  She is so talented and amazing.  I love the rich quality of her voice and the versatility she has with it.  Her songs have the coolest beats and are intelligently composed with great changes in them.  She is so unique, but yet, so catchy.  That is a rare combination. I'm a total fan!<br />[[ASIN:B0019HBVFQ Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set]]
B000JLQSW4|5.0|When this album came out, I was in high school working at the school radio station, and I played the heck out of it.  I know every note of this album by heart, and it's one of my fave APP albums.  Loosely based on Isaac Asimov's robot series of books, it has some of the most memorable APP tunes, \\"I Wouldn't Wanna Be Like You,\\" \\"Breakdown,\\" and \\"Day After Day.\\"  Highly recommended as a good \\"starter album\\" for folks interested in APP.
B000I5XOVY|4.0|Solid action movie with a great cast.  Interesting story and concept. Great value on blu-ray as well.
0671799320|5.0|The book is written from the perspective of someone who loves capitalism and thinks that the oil economy is the best thing since sliced bread (ie someone about as far from me politically as it's possible to get), but that hasn't stopped me from reading and re-reading this book and recommending to dozens of people.  All history is biased, I can deal with that.  What makes this book great is that the author is very clear about his perspective so you don't have to guess where he's coming from or who's story he's advocating and because he tells his story with style and with an incredible attention to details, facts, and historical context.  Interested in WWII?  Read this book.  Curious about Robber Baron Capitalism?  Read this book.  Looking for insights into British policy in the middle east or American foreign policy around the world?  Read this book.  It's an astonishing work in its breadth, its depth, and its attention to detail.  Highly recommended.

0307387178|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  The book covers a little more than the movie covered and goes into other discussions about adventures into the Alaskan wilderness.  I don't know which one I liked better, but I have watched and read both versions of this story over and over. You won't be disappointed.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Of course the movie was great, but, I was astonished as to the quality of the company.  Amazon was great in communications, time of release of the movie, and good at time of delivery.  I will be anxious to use the company again, and, again
B0000DBJDM|5.0|\\"PINK FLOYD-- live in Pompeii\\" is a fascinating view into the early 70s period of the world's foremost prog-rock band. The near 40-year-old footage featured in this video alone is worth the price of admission! Whether it's watching David Gilmour weaving psychedelic soundscapes with a slide and his now-vintage strat cradled on his lap during the band's early epic \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" to Roger Waters affectionately referring to their music as \\"rock and roll\\" during an interview (weren't the 70s great?!) this video is a must-see for any classic rock fan.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Well thought out spinoff. Great cast with good chemistry. If you've not seen seasons 1-4 yet it is important to view them first to fully understand running storyline. The ending left me wanting more but that just means they didn't over-milk the series.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|\\"Tonight\\" being the best Franz Ferdinand album so far, puts the fun back into funk as it mixes rock, dance and other elements reminding everyone how exciting (while being grown up) guitar based pop can be.    Opener \\"Ulysses\\" is a dark parable of druggy delusion and the dangers of being out at night with strangers who might well be angels or demons. It takes you on a slow and quietly menacing journey that is simultaneously frightening and strangely seductive, generating a sublime pleasure below its calm but threatening surface, with a glint in its eye full of promise and risk.    \\"Turn it on\\" is a tale of obsessive love with a great rock and roll feel to it that only the Ferdinand's could manage with \\"No you girls\\" and \\"Send him away\\" being loosely connected to it conceptually.    \\"No you girls\\" is probably the most eloquent, insightful (not to mention coolest) song ever written about the phenomenon of \\"boy meets girl\\". Its subtle play on sexual politics uses an innocent teen ritual for its backdrop, creating a new and interesting twist on the drama of a young person's coming of age.    \\"Send him away\\" also has a sweet sound which is ironically contrasted by its content. Get a load of the saucy lyric \\"Well, I don't care his skin is still between still folds on your sheets...\\" sounding like something else if you use your imagination. It's also the most honest account of jealousy you'll hear in a contemporary rock track for a while.    \\"Twilight omens\\" is a surreal take on \\"Turn it on\\" - obsessive love seen through the lens of a semi-dream state and no doubt a few cans of lager the night before and could easily slot into the same thematic folder containing \\"Lucid dreams\\", an epic fusion of good solid rock, psychedelia and acidic, industrial electronica, next to \\"Dream again\\", a hallucinatory trip that could have come off  \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\".    My favourites though have to be the high energy of \\"Can't stop feeling\\", a funky expression of theennui and abandonment of the lovelorn and \\"Live alone\\", one of those excellent dance tracks that speaks of a grim emotional truth while disguised as a catchy disco rhythm.    \\"Katherine kiss me\\" provides a sweet romantic closure and is an ending that arrives much too soon. It's the cue to immediately put the whole album back on to once again enjoy a thrill you know you never missed but want to replay all the same.    \\"Tonight\\" creates the atmosphere of a good night out and explores the world that exists in all those lost weekends of Friday night pub crawls, Saturday night dance marathons and hazy descents into the malaise of Sunday morning. As the first track \\"Ulysses\\" suggests, it's a modern poem to the spirit of adventure in an urban landscape that's as exciting and as dangerous as anything in an epic myth.
B0007TKNII|5.0|i loved this film when I first saw it, and am glad i was finally able to get the wide screen version of it on DVD. Its a haunting, yet beautiful film. Loved the characters and the music, and esp the phantom.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|I have to say that I LOVE this show! Its different, good character development, lots of nudity and really great fighting considering it's a TV series.  This show isn't for children but I think adults should give it a try and don't listen to people that only watch the show for 20 minutes and think they know how the show turned out!
B001PO53IO|5.0|this is a great show for fans of the star wars universe, and fans of great looking HD content!
B001PJ7TUE|3.0|There's no doubt the Prodigy personify the ultimate fusion of rock and dance music.    Ever since \\"The fat of the land\\" no one else managed as well as them to capture the excitement and immediacy inherent in both genres. \\"Invaders must die\\" recalls elements of the Prodigy's great past with its constant refrain in the title track and a build up of tension like a call to arms, reminding us how exciting an act they are (especially as a live prospect).    \\"Omen\\"  sounds like another blast from the past. \\"Colours\\" is like the silly sample from a fruit machine that no one should have thought of but \\"Take me to the hospital\\" soon gets things back on track with its combination of high energy, aggression and dread. \\"Thunder\\" has the impact of the noise it describes and \\"Warrior's dance\\" - again recalls their 90's past. \\"Run with the wolves\\" - more of the same really...but still fun.    With \\"Omen reprise\\" simply being a filler, one might be tempted to conclude the Prodigy have run out of ideas and are simply regurgitating old formulae. But something always niggles at the back of your mind saying they've yet to fulfil their potential and will any moment spring a surprise on you.    Unfortunately that surprise doesn't happen here but there's enough to suggest greater things are possible.    \\"Worlds on fire\\" is probably one of the most effective but simply expressed messages of urgency about the state of the world I've heard in a long time with its minimal use of words accompanied by a bristling bassline and \\"Piranha\\" is the soundtrack to a nightmarish 50's B-movie on acid. \\"Stand up\\" holds no surprises but at least keeps things moving.     Having actually bought everything this lot have produced since their 1992 debut and \\"The fat of the land\\", I wouldn't say this was their best piece of work - just a routine and solid offering dutifully delivered to their continuously sizeable fan base.    I hope in future the Prodigy can do something more complex. They've got the formula forinspiring energy in a crowd patented and locked down but the transition between `good' and `great' will take much more than what they've delivered here. Let's hope it happens soon while they're still young enough to leap about the stage and electrify the dance floor which this record is ideal for and manages quite efficiently.
B001R4BTSU|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this lp. I was expecting something like \\"worrisome heart\\". My favorite is still \\"Some Lessons , the Bedroom Sessions\\" from Melody.
B00007LTIB|5.0|I believe \\"Relayer\\" followed \\"Topographic Oceans\\" in 1975.   There are just three tracks on this album and Rick Wakeman was replaced by the great Patrick Moraz.   \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" takes up one entire side and the material picks right up where it left off with Topographic Oceans\\" with it's unparalleled use of evolving time signatures, uneven tempos and carefully laid out \\"movements\\" that can only be described as Classical Progressive Rock! \\"Sound Chaser\\" is a demonstration of their speed and agility! Doubtful if anyone could preform it live. Including Yes themselves.  Relayer is also one for the die hard Yes fans with a bit of musical knowledge.  Yes was at their peak when they started releasing albums that contained songs over the 20 minute mark. The first being \\"Close to the Edge\\" in 1972 and ending with \\"Going for the One.\\" in 1978. For which Steve Howe won Guitar Players magazine's, \\"Guitar Player of the Year\\" award. These epic compositions are so far ahead of their time and far beyond the average listener who listens to music for fun rather than for it's expert compositional qualities!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I've never heard an album that expresses desire and love with such raw passion and danger than \\"Lungs\\". Such is the depth behind it's exploration of the follies, vulnerabilities and power of the human heart, it must be the closest thing so far to a musical definition of our emotional lives.    \\"Dog days are over\\" is a beautiful, moving and defiant testament to surviving hurt and finding happiness again. Its words trace the emotional arc between sad fear and confident triumph, quietly inspiring a sublime euphoria.    \\"Rabbit heart\\" is an incredible ballad telling of how a great love comes at a price, where you have to give up something of yourself to prove you're worthy of it and \\"I'm not calling you a liar\\" is a song about an all consuming love so possessive, it draws the listener in deeply, making one feel that there is something that means more than life itself.    \\"Lungs\\" explores the dark side of relationships too. This comes out in tracks like \\"Kiss with a fist\\", an agressive, bristling slice of rockabilly containing passionate words so violent, you wouldn't want it to sound any other way and \\"Girl with one eye\\", which crackles with a slow burning tension till it reaches a crescendo, all ridden like a Valkyrie by Florence Welch's juggernaut of a voice. \\"My boy builds coffins\\" is a lovely folksy pop record that might seem morbid at first but speaks a universal truth.    It's when \\"Lungs\\" reflects on the yearning, despairing and needy elation of love that it's full impact becomes apparent however.    \\"Drumming song\\" moves along with a percussive power as passionate as the desire it expresses, \\"Cosmic love\\" is simply gorgeous, with a lyrical beauty you want to hear every word of, \\"Binding\\" is a hypnotic poem with the pounding of a giants heart beat in the background and \\"Hurricane drunk\\" is the true incarnation of girl power, with it's defiant war cry of courage against emotional pain, all wrapped up in a soulful funk that would set any dance floor on fire.    \\"Howl\\" is reminiscent of something Kate Bush would have done. It's about a love so powerful it's feral, an uncontrollable beast crazy with the fuel of obsessive need. \\"You've got the love\\" is an incendiary reworking of Candi Staton's classic that pays a worthy homage with the strength and raw emotion that the original song deserves and like \\"I'm not calling you a liar\\", \\"Between two Lungs\\"  is another song of desire so urgent, life itself depends on it.    \\"Lungs\\" is an album we are not worthy of. Given the dearth of such brilliant song writing in today's music charts, one wonders if people will truly appreciate it. It is rich, evocative and deserves to be listened to a thousand times in order to fully realise its value. While I listened to it, it seemed like a distillation of every great female singer song writer of the last 20 years.    This is a beautiful, heart rending and powerful record that's frightening in its intensity and thoroughly deserves not just the Brit award it won recently for the best album of 2009, but to be remembered as one of the best albums of the decade.
1439153663|5.0|This is chick-lit-historical-fiction at it's best. Every turn of the page is murder, mayhem, rape, and forbidden love affairs. Everything you need to get the blood bubbling.<br /><br />The Kitchen House follows two female protagonists, Lavinia, a white indentured servant from Ireland, and Belle, a beautiful half-black half-white slave. The story is written in alternating chapters, with Lavinia's chapters being considerably longer than Belle's.<br /><br />Belle acts as Lavinia's mother figure when she is first brought to the plantation. Lavinia is happy with her black family, but as she grows older and more beautiful, outside forces tear her from her family and thrust her into the white world she doesn't understand and doesn't feel connected to. Many minor characters are killed, sold, raped, and beaten throughout Lavinia's life, breaking her heart and ours each time.<br /><br />Belle, on the other hand, is hated by the master's family because they think she is his mistress. In reality, she is his daughter. We also follow Belle's sad story through both her and Lavinia's eyes.<br /><br />To try and sum up all the details and complexities of the relationships between the many characters would just confuse, so that's all the summary I will attempt.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much, compelled to stay up late nights flipping through pages with a hunger I haven't felt in a long time. Grissom writes in a beautiful southern tone throughout the novel, and her use of detail and observations are compelling. However, I am aware that my love of this novel may be mostly because of how much action and violence is laced throughout, and my love of it feels a little cheap.<br /><br />Though there are many characters in this novel, Grissom writes them in such a distinct way that the reader is always clear on who they are. I've often read other novels with an abundance of characters so indistinct from each other that I would get them mixed up. This never happened with The Kitchen House. The characters came alive so fully that it would be impossible to get them mixed up.<br /><br />However, the majority of these complex and beautiful characters are female, as it goes with chick-lit. It is common for male characters to be flat and unforgivable, but Grissom surprises again with male characters that are as complex, if not more so, than her female characters.<br /><br />Marshall, an especially complex character, does the most horrible acts to everyone around him. And yet, the reader can't help but feel sorry for him, knowing his twisted past. We watch Marshall as he turns from innocent child to sadistic monster, and his fall from grace is even more compelling at times than Lavinia's narrative.<br /><br />One aspect of character development I was disappointed with was how pure and good Lavinia was. \\"With the heart of a child\\" as she is often described. We are the closest with her and her thoughts as the majority of the book is from her p.o.v. , yet she lacks the depth a lot of the other characters have. She is portrayed as an angel that just loves everyone. The only time we see her off her pedestal is during a drug-induced escapism she uses to get away from her miserable life- something we don't blame her for, and a short period of time when she harbors resentment for an old friend for sleeping with her husband. Again, can't really blame her.

B00007LTIA|5.0|I bought the original album which had an excerpt from Jon Anderson explaining how he got the idea for these four different concepts while reading the Hindu Shastras. Unfortunately, that except is not available with the cd you buy today.   This is an absolute masterpiece!   Only true Yes fans will take the time to listen to it over and over again before they start getting the idea behind this music!   Their use of constantly changing time signatures and tempos. Complex rhythmic structures and syncopation's along with such carefully laid out movements in symphonic and classical form would have even Bach praising this music himself. Can only be described as 'classical progressive rock\\". This is 1974 people! What has happened to music? If you're a fan of Yes and have a little understanding about music, this one is a definite for your collection! Enjoy!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|It Might Get Loud is one of those rare movies that glues you to the screen.  If you are a guitarist, this is a must watch/own.  The blending of 3 different decades of musicians comparing nottes, inspirations, styles, sounds ideas is gripping from start to finish.  The film inspires you to play your guitar, but at the same time you are torn as you do not want to miss a single second of the film.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I can't believe I was stupid enough to buy or watch this movie.  I kept thinking this movie is going to get better, but never did.  Don't waste your time with this Hollywood version of the Iraq War.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|Movie - 4.0    When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I didn't think much of it. It looked like it would've been a decent crime thriller or something of that sort, but, boy, was I wrong. Law Abiding Citizen, in fact, is a pretty good movie filled with heavy amounts of ethical and moral quandaries, metaphorical allusions to how people are responsible for their own actions, and is an eerie testament to the legal system's flaws and shortcomings. I was actually reminded a lot of The Count of Monte Cristo in how a man just loses everything, gets cheated by the system, and in about ten years time amasses a fortune to plan out this giant, masterful revenge plot against all those embedded within that system and those whom he feels have wronged both himself and the rest of society. Well, it's not as epic as the Dumas classic, but if the writers did, indeed, use it as some kind of inspiration, bravo. The thing that fascinates me the most about this film is the tension. Once you see the traumatic event that triggers Butler's character and the way he's unjustly justified through court (in a city that ironically prides itself on \\"justice\\"), how can you blame the guy for going off the deep end and putting all this chaos into action? On top of that, I've yet to even mention the predicament of the law versus vigilantism. By now, I'm sure we've all seen some example or another of how operating outside \\"the system\\" can also be thoroughly more effective than the papers and red tape of the law, or at least that's the message I get from the ending. However, in the process I feel the movie also loses quite a bit of steam when certain plot points are revealed toward the end. I also feel that there isn't enough \\"change\\" to the system itself, so much as it is for just one person. Maybe it's to illustrate the futility of how the system can't be changed and how it continues to suck, or maybe they just wanted us to get the message that revenge isn't all it's cut up to be?    Video - 4.5Law Abiding Citizen is brought to us by Starz / Anchor Bay in 1080p using the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.39). This is the first Starz / AB Blu-ray I've ever watched, so I wasn't sure what I was getting. But to tell you the truth, it's not so bad. The film's gritty nature reflects well in the photography, which leads to a darker color palette that more or less is as vibrant as it can be. Black levels, however, are excellent with darkness and shadows being the highlight of the presentation. Contrast is also surprisingly good given the amount of dimly-lit scenes. The only faults I have are with a little loss in texture and detail in some of the closeup shots and a few instances of debris popping up here and there, which is really weird considering most recent films usually have none.    Audio - 4.5    Despite all the dialogue, the movie also is very proficient with its TrueHD 5.1 track. The dialogue is clear and free of any anomalies, and surround usage is fairly immersive during prison and other facility takes. However, the real workout comes in the bigger action sequences and through various parts of Brian Tyler's score. High/low ends are deadly accurate for the cemetery scene, with LFEs exceeding my expectations for explosions. The score is fairly quiet when need be for certain parts of the movie, but when things start getting crazy, I feel it really helps establish a good mood for the fast pace. I wouldn't quite call this a reference disc, though, as a few parts of the movie didn't feel as engaging as I thought they'd be, but this is an excellent first-time listen for me.    Extras - 3.0    There's a commentary, two main bits about legal terminology and filming, a graphics progression bit, and a bunch of trailers. The legal terminology feature was what I found most interesting. It basically breaks down the logic and reasoning behind the decisions made at the beginning of the movie, as analyzed and explained by two formerPhiladelphia attorneys, and makes a lot of sense. The filming feature was a short, though unorganized, look at how they shot certain scenes, came up with ideas for the writing, and so on. It was interesting on a few parts, but not as detailed as I expected. I would've liked a more in-depth interview with director F. Gary Gray about the plot.    Overall - 4.0    The movie makes for some great, great drama, exploitation of the legal system, and \\"what if\\" dilemmas. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit of a downer in that it feels \\"too easy\\" and kind of loses the overall point of trying evoke change within \\"the system.\\" But a large majority of the movie is still very good and very tense. Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx aren't on screen together a whole lot of the time, but it makes for a cool battle of wits when they do. With excellent A/V presentation and a decent set of extras, Law Abiding Citizen comes highly recommended.

B00132D808|4.0|In the first track of this album \\"We're So Starving\\" Brendon Urie reminds us that they're still the same band.  This is a lie. But sometimes that's not a bad thing. From the instant the album starts, any Panic At The Disco (notice there's no \\"!\\" after Panic) fanatic will know this has completely taken a different than A Fever You Cant Sweat Out. There isn't any more ridiculous names like \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage\\" and the songs don't sound like they were written by Fall Out Boy. The album is fantastic and it just shines of Beatles and Beach Boys influence from the Sergeant Peppers esque beginning to the nonsensical but whimsical She's A Handsome Woman to the baroque She Had the World. Songs like Nine in the Afternoon are brilliant and Brendon Urie's voice soars through every song, especially Pas De Chavel. Some of the songs are simple and fun like Behind the Sea, while songs like Northern Downpour show a tremendous amount of emotion without falling into the Emo genre. Case in point is, this album is a true diamond in the rough of pop music and should be given consideration not only by fans of the band, but anyone else that wouldn't mind some reminiscing of some of the most influential bands of yester-year

B0030MM68O|3.0|My wife and I were expecting a lot more out of this movie, but were quite disappointed. The scenes were intense and even if they aren't true depictions, gives the viewer a taste of the constant tension one would face. The problem is, this is a movie, and normally a movie has a story to go along with all the scenes. The Hurt Locker is missing this vital element. There are also some glaring screen writing no no's, that can only be broken with great skill, skill in which the writer apparently lacks. One major one being that our hero doesn't change. Decent movie, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|When it comes to Narration of documentaries, Oprah, does NOT come to mind!  When it comes to slightly reverse-racism, forgotten roots, over-done pull-at-your-heart-strings tv, and a mostly female following... I think of Oprah.      Why in the hell American producers thought... let's take out the narration track of a veteran and much more respected personality, like David Attenborough and replace it with Oprah, goes way beyond stupidity!  If they needed someone to replace David, there is a catalog of people who have the voice for this sort of work...    James Earl Jones  Morgan Freeman  Patrick Stewart  Leonard Nemoy  Anthony Head  Majel Barrett  and even President Obama    Though, my choices, are mostly men, I personally feel, men fit this profile better.  There are many many talented female voices out there, and I'm sure I am just forgetting them, at the moment.  But, my point is, there were much better and certainly more qualified candidates for this gig than Oprah!      Seriously people, although the cover for the Oprah version is more colourful and attractive... the content it is the same with Attenboroghs.  So, do yourself a favor, buy the ORIGINAL Attenborough version.  He is the same voice you are very familiar with from Planet Eart and Blue Planet.      American producers basically wasted their money by changing the narration to Oprah from someone alot more qualified and certainly more pleasant to listen to speak!      Oh and if you don't want to wait for America to show you the Oprah-fied version and then for the release in June... goto Amazon.co.uk and buy the PAL version!  Then go out and buy a 29.99 cheap DVD player from Target or Walmart, search Google for your model number and the word \\"region free crack\\" or something thereof, and you have yourself an international DVD player without having to pay the price for one.  Then you don't have to wait on America to get the programs you wanted last year!!!  That's what I do!  And the picture quality is alwaysbetter, in my opinion, on the PAL discs!  I stopped buying American DVD's a while ago.  Even with the exchange rate as it is... you will still pay far less than getting it when Amazon.com gets it!
B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"Beggars Banquet\\" is one of the very big Rolling Stones albums. Not only does the album contains the hit \\"Street Fighting Man\\" and classics like \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" \\"Stray Cat Blues,\\" \\"Salt of the Earth\\" and \\"Jig Saw Puzzle\\", it was also with this album that the famous Rolling Stones sound was founded.<br /><br />There is little doubt that producer Jimmy Miller had a great share in creating the sound that would become the group's hallmark for years to come. After a little groping with the album \\"Their Satanic Majesty's Request\\", which certainly also had its moments, there was need to find a more basic sound that was more a natural extension of the group's musical roots. You clearly feel on several numbers the Jimmy Miller imprint, and some places even similarities with another group Miller produced these years, namely Traffic.<br /><br />Roughly speaking, the album's tracks can be divided into two groups; the acoustic and very blues inspirerd, and the more modern rocking, with biting and satirical lyrics, obviously inspired by Bob Dylan.<br /><br />The acoustic numbers could as easily have fitted into previous albums, like \\"Between the Buttons\\" and it is not really on those we discover the \\"new\\" Stones. However, the songs are absolutely very good, especially the touching \\"No Expectations\\", with nice slide guitar by Brian Jones.<br /><br />However, it is the \\"electric\\" tracks makes the album a classic. The opening song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is more or less the epitome of the new sound.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Be warned, the theme song of this fanciful epic by the renowned Hayao Miyazaki, who won an Best Animated Film Oscar for \\"Spirited Away\\" (reportedly, even the directors of \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" voted for that film even though their film was in the same competition.<br /><br />\\"Ponyo,\\" a.k.a. \\"Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,\\" is perhaps the most innocent and wondrous of Miyazaki's films. It's said to be loosely based on \\"The Little Mermaid\\" (even the DVD package suggest this) but it really only bears a passing resemblance to either the Andersen or Disney versions. Like other Miyazaki films, it tells its own story by its own rules and requires that you allow yourself \\"into\\" an almost alternate universe that coexists with a realistic world. Sorry to be so pithy, but it's hard to describe these films adequately. They need to be experienced.<br /><br />Big name stars perform the dubbed English version and most of them agreed because of their love for the director's previous work.<br /><br />Among these is Liam Neeson, who appears on camera on one of the bonus features on the two disc set. Tina Fey says she was channeling the movie moms she grew up with. We see the cherished Betty White in recording sessions (she plays one of three ladies in a nursing facility, the other two voiced by Lily Tomlin and Cloris Leachman). Especially remarkable are the performances of young Noah Cyrus (Miley's sister) and Frankie Jonas (the Jonas Brothers' little brother) as the two leads. It's difficult enough to match the voices in an overdubbed foreign language film, it's quite another to add emotion and depth.<br /><br />My children loved this film. It was their first introduction to Miyazaki, which can be an acquired taste for some. If you enjoy and admire the work of Pixar, you can't deny the extreme (and eagerly credited) influence of Miyazaki on Pixar character development and storytelling in particular.<br /><br />The two DVD discs also include a storyboarded version of the film and lots of short features about the music, voices, characters and setting of \\"Ponyo.\\"<br /><br />My only question -- where was the U.S released soundtrack album, including the Cyrus/Jonas version of the song?characters and setting of \\"Ponyo.\\"    My only question -- where was the U.S released soundtrack album, including the Cyrus/Jonas version of the song?

0451527712|4.0|I purchased this book for a history class.  Of course I have seen the movie.  This book is nothing like the movie.  After I understood that it was written during the Romanticism period than it was actually a pleasure to read.  At nineteen, how old Mary Shelley was when she wrote Frankenstein, she wrote an amazing and deeply profound  story of a being that is looking for what everyone of us look for:  the comfort of companionship and love of another.  Human beings are meant to be in relationships of one kind or another.  Mary Shelley also does an admirable job showing the anguish of Victor.  You see the love,support, and concern of his family.  It was thought-provoking and poignant.  I found myself hoping the being would find what he so desperately craved.  i felt his frustration at such an injustice, as he saw it.  If you have seen the movie I strongly recommend Frankenstein.  I promise, you won't be disappointed.
B0030MM68O|3.0|From the opening scene, I had trouble w/ the details in the film.  When the wheel on the trailer falls off, the guy in the explosive suit removes the explosives and neatly lays them on the IED.  I don't think dropping the trailer off would have been so neat.  The way the bomb squad leaves the base and arrives before other teams is also unbelievable.      The fact the academy showered this movie w/ awards just confirms my thoughts- at least half of them are nuts!
0061807400|1.0|A fan of Lehane, it is hard to write a negative review of one of his novels.  So - I'll start with the positives.  He is excellent at creating psychologically twisted characters and dramatically intense plots.<br /><br />However, in this novel, the plot takes a crazy turn that is so hard, as a reader, to recover from.<br /><br />It begins with Teddy and his partner on a ferry to a hospital for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a patient. From the start, Shutter Island is the enemy. It seems too obvious that the coming weather has the potential to trap them there.  The elusive creepy Doctor in charge at the island, Cawley, is cliche. And throughout, the story never quite seems believable.  In fact, it seemed almost bizarre.<br /><br />So--when the horrendous weather rolls in and Teddy is desperately searching and hiding in place of no escape, it seemed annoying and frustrating as opposed to intense and intriguing.  When the story takes the ultimate twist, as a reader I was left totally let down and feeling like I had basically wasted my time.  The \\"crazy\\" factor of the patients, employees, and main characters seemed completely over-the-top.<br /><br />This might be one case where the movie will end up being better than the book (hoping!).  I do suggest Lehane's other books such as Sacred or Gone Baby Gone.

B001TOD92C|5.0|[Spoiler - I'll give away a good chunk of the story here, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read this]<br /><br />At the time that I am writing this review, this movie is almost a year old, and currently has 132 5-star reviews on Amazon. I don't think that there is really all that much that I can say about it to praise it that hasn't already been said. Suffice it to say that I really enjoyed this movie and gave it a 5-star rating as well.<br /><br />One thing I enjoy doing on here is seeing what the \\"other side\\" thinks and reading the 1-star reviews. Now, I usually try to play nice and not insult other people online, but I just can't help myself. The worst kind of idiot is the kind that doesn't realize they're an idiot and puts their idiocy on display repeatedly for everyone to see. These people are idiots... in the worst way.<br /><br />Every 1-star review that I read said the same thing. I'll sum it up in my own words: \\"Mickey and Marisa were good, but I don't like the sleazy lifestyle that the film portrays and I don't like that The Ram didn't redeem himself.\\" A few people even went as far as to say that this movie represents the dumbing down of society. In my opinion, the only dumbing down of society that I see is the people that fail to grasp what this movie is about and simply expect that every movie should have a feel-good ending with a noble hero.<br /><br />Truth is that not everyone in life is able to redeem themselves and right their wrongs. The Ram's life has been in a downward spiral for 20 years. Due to a heart attack, he is forced to try to change it, but wrestling is the only thing he knows, and he's already burnt the bridge with his daughter. He can't relate to the world around him and feels out of place in it (he's even still clinging to his old Nintendo game with his character in it and has never heard of the one that the kid talks about). When he screws up his relationship again with his daughter and gets rejected by the one woman that he thought understood him, he comes to the realization that the only place that he actually belongs is in wrestling; it's the only life he knows. At the end of the movie he claims that he can only get hurt outside of the ring.<br /><br />No, it's not a happy ending. It's sad to watch The Ram on this path of self-destruction. I'll admit that I was captivated by the character and wanted to see him turn his life around. When he started talking to his daughter again, I was pulling for him. When he met with Pam outside of the club, I was pulling for him. When it all fell apart, I felt for him. This movie depressed me, as it did to many of the reviewers who slammed it. The point being that I recognize the fact that the emotional effect that the movie had on me was because I was engulfed and emotionally involved in the movie... and if it could emotionally effect me, then the movie did what was intended to do. Those who gave it a 1-star review simply dismissed it because it wasn't a happy ending. Sad, really, what our society is coming to.omes to the realization that the only place that he actually belongs is in wrestling; it's the only life he knows.

0618001905|5.0|I first heard of this terrible episode of colonialist history when I stumbled upon Mark Twain's denunciation of it in \\"King Leopold's Soliloquy\\" years ago. Hochschild's book lays the details of this out in summary fashion. Circa 1870, Belgium, a small country by European standards with no colonies, was able to obtain this vast area, almost twice the size of Alaska, with the consent of the other big powers who were thus lifted of the task of fighting themselves over it as they did not view Belgium as any kind of a great power rival. Belgian King Leopold and his cronies, however, bolstered their case by claiming their intentions were entirely altruistic in that they would civilize and Christianize the heathen black masses and save them from Arab slave traders who operated in the far eastern region of this area.<br /><br />As the author explains, this was highly specious and incredibly hypocritical posturing designed for consumption by polite Victorian society, when the intent and mission of Belgian commercial interests and Leopold personally was aggrandizement and plunder on a grand scale that was a great ambition and which formed much of the zeitgeist of the Gilded Age. In reality, Arab slavery was a very marginal and small scale institution in the Congo focused on domestic labor that existed in a very remote region far from the Atlantic and mid-inland areas that the Europeans were primarily interested in and with which they in reality did little beyond token measures to interfere with.<br /><br />More importantly, the Belgians themselves set up their own ruthless system of involuntary servitude that was as bad, or even worse, than the worst examples of ante-bellum chattel slavery, this after that system had been abolished in the US. Instead of acknowledging this reality, however, they hypocritically denied and obscured it, in a manner worthy of Orwell, by referring to these slaves as free and liberated persons. Things got even worse with the advent of the Rubber Terror when the value of rubber became appreciated in Europe which caused the Belgians and their cohorts to commit horrible atrocities, holding whole families and even villages hostages until quotas of rubber vines were delivered to them. If this failed to happen, hostages were killed and mutilated, even children. It was Joseph Conrad's experiences on the Congo River in this period that inspired him to write \\"Heart of Darkness\\" which later formed the basis for the movie \\"Apocalypse Now\\". We all know the stories of Americans killing buffalo for sport. Belgians and Europeans, most notoriously adventurer Henry Stanley, did that to black Africans from their river boats.<br /><br />E.D. Morel, a British journalist, and others began a movement to expose these horrors that after many years began to cause some improvement in the condition of the Congolese in what was one of the most atrocious examples of the abuses of European colonialism in the Third World, an egregious set-up that continued right up to the advent of independence with the intrigues against Patrice Lumumba in 1960-61.

B001HN6940|3.0|19 year old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the magical Wonderland from when she was young and meets some old friends, and learns of her destiny.. to overthrow the evil Red Queen, sister to the good White Queen (Anne Hathaway).<br /><br />I rather enjoyed it. Dark and weird, but it's really a sequel in feel, so why call it Alice in Wonderland? Return to Wonderland would have been an more apt title. Although that is probably too similar to Return to Oz...<br /><br />Whereas the Disney Wonderland felt bright, surreal and colourful, this film had a very muted colour pallette even in the \\"real\\" world and Tim Burton's Wonderland had a kind of run-down, almost post apocolyptic feel. I pictured Alice being about 10 years old in the novel and 1951 Disney adaptation.<br /><br />In that sense, by making this film a kind of sequel with Alice now in her late teens, maybe the broken, dark Wonderland becomes a metaphor for lost innocence and childhood itself, and how one's perception of childhood changes as you get older, which I think is actually quite clever.<br /><br />I felt the 2 bookending parts of the film were boring (in the opening, we learn Alice is getting married to a slimy suitor) and I didnt feel for those characters.<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska gave a good performance playing Alice as she was more independent and resourceful than I remember, surely ahead of her time!<br /><br />I did like Helena Bonham Carter's turn as the Red Queen a lot - even though, talking with a high pitched, childish lisp, she reminded me of Miranda Richardson's Queenie in Blackadder II! In fact, she ripped off that interpretation wholesale. But still very funny.<br /><br />Stephen Fry was excellent and probably gave the best \\"performance\\" of the cast as the Cheshire Cat but he was criminally underused I felt. Alan Rickman had just the right kind of stately voice of the Cattepillar.<br /><br />In order to bring peace to Wonderland, Alice must slay the monster known as the Jabberwocky (I don't remember this Harry Potter type battle from the novel), which seemed shoehorned in to give the film some more structure and narrative and give the older, supposedly more resourceful Alice a mission, which The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) helps her with. His performance is a strange one - wearing lots of make up and adopting an occasional Scottish accent, there may be some sadness as well as madness in his air because he and the other characters have been waiting up to 13 years for Alice to come back.<br />However, in one scene the Hatter does a Michael Jackson inspired dance for no apparent reason, which I found cringeworthy.<br /><br />The suggestion through the film that Wonderland may actually be real (with Alice often questioning her surroundings) reminded me of themes explored in Pan's Labyrinth and The Chronicles of Narnia. In my opinion this gave the film a darker edge and made it more appealing to adults and older children.h seemed shoehorned in to give the film some more structure and narrative and give the older, supposedly more resourceful Alice a mission, which The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) helps her with.

1400049628|5.0|Off of a whim a friend decided to pick up the Zombie Survival Guide as a present for me. I'd previously read a few pages and enjoyed it. Needless to say, I now love it. The guide is incredibly detailed with the survival methods listed. You'd swear you were reading a book for surviving in the wild really. Everything from avoiding infection to finding shelter to surviving in a zombie world! The best part is some of the humor within the guide. Occasionally, you'll run into a particular scenario where the author will throw a bit of humor into the scenario or have a picture that can crack you up. Still, Max Brooks has brought a very serious issue to the forefront of my mind. In short, get your guide, sharpen your machete and prep for the apocalypse! You can be too prepared!

B0034KZE2W|4.0|I was searching for a pair of shoes to wear to clinical (since I am a nursing student)that didn't hurt my feet. I tried New Balance (my favorite casual sneaker) but was left feeling sore. I also have a pair of Birkenstocks that are nice, but require a break-n period and cost an arm and a leg. I kept reading about how a lot of nurses (guys included) and doctors loved the Crocs. I ordered this pair in white (per my school's dress code) and have been pleasantly surprised by them!<br />  There is no break-on period to speak of; you just put them on and the body heat from your feet will make the Crocs material more pliable. The clogs do fit rather loose, and I ordered a full size down from my normal sneaker size to get a better fit (eg - I wear size 10.5 to 11 in New Balance, but a size 10 in Crocs). The loose fit took some getting used to, but it's fine now.<br />  The Crocs have side ports on them near the toe box to facilitate air exchange, but my feet still get sweaty, though not as bad as with the Croc knock-offs I tried. The Crocs can also be wiped down with bleach or soap and water, unlike my sneakers where if I got body fluids on them, they could soak in.<br />  I've only had these for a few days now, but I am impressed. Time will tell as to how well they hold up for a 5-6 hour clinical or for a 12-hour CNA shift.<br />  For now, though, I say give 'em a try - they aren't terribly expensive, they've received several endorsements by ergonomics experts and podiatrists (plus I've seen multiple OR nurses, surgeons, and anesthetists wearing these as well FWIW).<br /><br />Hope this helps!

B002S0OBN2|1.0|Reviewed By: Natasha Tripney · Mar 10, 2010  · London      Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess  in Love Never Dies  (© Catherine Ashmore)   Sequels are always potentially dangerous ground, and this has certainly proved to be the case with Love Never Dies, Andrew Lloyd Webber's follow-up to his most popular musical, The Phantom of the Opera, now at the Adelphi Theatre. The new show, directed by Jack O'Brien, turns out to be muddled and baffling, and full of moments of unintentional humor. It is also unlikely to satisfy existing Phantom fans nor attract new ones.     The story is set 10 years after the events of the original. The Phantom (Ramin Karimloo) has fled to America -- specifically to Coney Island, where surrounded by freaks and circus folk he has created his own Barnum-style attraction, Phantasma. Meg Giry (Summer Strallen) and Madame Giry (Liz Robertson) have accompanied him across the Atlantic and Meg is now topping the bill there nightly, desperately seeking his approval.     Without revealing his identity, the Phantom invites his former object of affection, the soprano Christine Daae (Sierra Boggess) to perform an aria he has written for her. Not surprisingly, she accepts, arriving with husband Raoul (Joseph Millson) and young son Gustave in tow. She needs the money, as Raoul is now a drunk with heavy gambling debts. Once more, she ends up caught between the two men, and the lack of suspense in who will win out is one of its most problematic elements: Christine's mind seems made up from the start.     Despite the contributions of four different people to the book -- Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton, as well as the lyricist Glenn Slater and the novelist Frederick Forsyth -- the dialogue is peppered with clunky exposition. As a stream of Vanderbilts and Astors spill off an ocean liner, a well-informed crowd member points out Christine and remarks that though she is still pitch-perfect, it's like \\"the flame has gone out or something.\\" Later, much is made of the significance of little Gustave being 10 years old in case the slower members of the audience have failed to make the connection.     Musically, it's a mixed affair in every sense. There are rock numbers and music hall pastiches as well as the obligatory ballads. \\"Devil Take The Hindmost,\\" the Phantom's showdown with Raoul, is suitably peppy, and the Phantom's first duet with Christine, \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky,\\" is fairly powerful, although more for the strength of their joint vocals then for the song itself. Christine's big emotive number, \\"Love Never Dies\\" (which is partly recycled from an earlier Lloyd Webber/Elton collaboration, The Beautiful Game), is rather limp in comparison. Worst of all, hardly any of the music digs its way under your skin.     Karimloo has an impressive voice and a measure of stage presence, yet he comes across as more eccentric than menacing. Boggess has a lovely voice, as well, but her Christine never seems particularly conflicted or troubled by the situation she finds herself in. She seems most comfortable in her scenes with Gustave (the role is split between seven young actors; at the performance I saw he was played, with a strong sense of timing and considerable vocal skill, by Harry Child). Saddled with a sliver of a role as Raoul, Millson has little to do but look cross and slink off.     Bob Crowley's projection-heavy design veers from the effective and elegant, in the moon-lit prologue and a later bar scene, to the ridiculous. The Phantom's tower-top aerie is truly a sight to behold; it's a cross between a Bond villain's lair and the Addams Family's attic.

B002TVQ4H6|4.0|This DVD is the same as [[ASIN:B002TVQ4HG Triangle]] but comes with a Lenticular cover sleeve instead. I assume the rest of the DVD is the same as once the sleeve comes off you get the same cover.  Basically all the reviews for Triangle apply to this one as well since they're the same.  I'll try not to repeat the others since those reviews apply to this movie as well.    It is focused on Jess (Melissa George) in rushing to a yacht for a getaway out into the sea for a day of sailing which turns deadly at the drop of a hat.  The movie has that ever \\"Twilight Zone\\" feel to it and ones looking for horror, thrills and suspense won't find it around each corner but they are hidden in there.  The movie certainly requires another viewing to catch more clues and lets you figure out the meaning at the end. You have to remind yourself that this isn't reality you're viewing or is it really a mixture of reality and something else?  Just think of it as \\"unexplained events\\" thus avoiding the unanswered questions you may have while watching.  I give credit to Melissa George on covering this role and think she did a wonderful job on the movie giving it more depth than a more unknown actress would have in the lead role.  I'm glad they went the traditional way of filming and didn't do no \\"Blair Witch\\" type of thing with a camcorder.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown's latest novel is a true thriller, filled with mysticism, enigmas, puzzles, suspense, and intrigue.  All the good stuff that makes reading delightful.    I enjoyed its precision both in describing the Capitol, where I once worked, and the Masonic craft, to which my father belonged.  I am the son of a widow's son.  And I have personal knowledge of Noetics and AMORC Rosicrucianism.    But the marvel is how Brown knits the various themes together to make an exciting, coherent whole, so that the reader anxiously keeps on turning the page, panting for what comes next.    This book is less doctrinaire than \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and likely steps on fewer toes.  But it is no less compelling, exciting, and fascinating.    Great reading!!!

By June of '71, progressive rock was starting to hit its stride: Yes and Jethro Tull introduced their strongest periods with significant personnel changes in Steve Howe and Barriemore Barlow respectively, with 1971's \\"The Yes Album,\\" and 1972's \\"Thick As A Brick.\\" Genesis would soon answer with \\"Foxtrot\\" and later, \\"Selling England by the Pound.\\" So ELP's sophomore effort Tarkus,\\" displayed more of the patented ELP features:  heavier use of Mini-Moog, odd time signatures, and great dynamics. Nowhere will you find greater use of these elements than on the title track. This extended epic/suite takes up all of Side One in LP terms, and is easily the hallmark piece on the album.  A long crescendo swell brings the band into a rotating 5/4 riff, accented by Carl Palmer's use of what might be the first use of a china-type (or \\"trash-can lid\\") crash cymbal. Keith Emerson introduces the first musical theme with a huge Mini-Moog phrase in the \\"Eruption\\" segment. It all settles in for a beautiful Greg Lake feature in \\"Stone of Years.\\"  Apparently Cotillion recognized the strength of this song and released a single-45, though in a clumsily abridged version. More odd time signatures follow in \\"Manticore\\" and \\"Battlefield.\\" Multiple Moog voices backed by a C. Palmer march time follow in a gradual fade only to segue into a bombastic reprise of the \\"Eruption\\" theme, and ending the piece. This exemplifies some of their finest extended works in the tradition of \\"Karn-Evil #9,\\" \\"Pirates,\\" and \\"Pictures At An Exhibition.\\"<br />The back half of the album is introduced by \\"Jeremy Bender\\"--a lighter piece by ELP standard, more effectively explored on other tracks such as \\"Benny the Bouncer\\" and \\"The Sheriff.\\" \\"Bitches Crystal\\" and \\"A Time and a Place\\" are intense Hammond B-3 driven rockers, in the \\"Knife Edge\\" vein, from the first album. \\"The Only Way\\" is a hymn piece juxtaposed against an agnostic/ questioning lyric that transitions into \\"Infinite Space\\"(Conclusion). \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" is basically a studio jam piece that ends the album in a send-off to their engineer Eddy Offord.<br /><br />Shout has remastered the audio to greater dynamics and crisper response...A brief, but at least, existent set of liner notes are included. No bonus tracks, see Rhino's box set, \\"Return Of the Manticore\\" for those. The original cartoon-like album artwork is included (check out the `70's style colors). ELP never had very strong covers until Brain Salad Surgery!<br /><br />Overall, not as essential as \\"Emerson, Lake, and Palmer\\" (first album), \\"Trilogy\\", or \\"Brain Salad Surgery,\\" but the title track is a must and Amazon has it a great price; otherwise you can nab it (and most of the bands' finest moments) in one final swoop with the Rhino box set.The Sheriff.\\" \\"Bitches Crystal\\" and \\"A Time and a Place\\" are intense Hammond B-3 driven rockers, in the \\"Knife Edge\\" vein, from the first album. \\"The Only Way\\" is a hymn piece juxtaposed against an agnostic/ questioning lyric that transitions into \\"Infinite Space\\"(Conclusion). \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" is basically a studio jam piece that ends the album in a send-off to their engineer Eddy Offord.

B002WCLG3Y|5.0|I'm an anime fan, and I also like 1st person shooters, and I have to say this DVD is an excellent entry-level journey into the world of HALO.<br /><br />  The episodes are well rendered, with specific artwork made for the particular storyline.<br />  The episodes PROTOTYPE and THE PACKAGE are (imho) two of the best on the disc.<br />  The all-CGI episode THE PACKAGE is a nonstop rollercoaster ride! It reminds me of that half-hour CGI show: Starship Troopers: Roughnecks...only more \\"gritty\\", and with a lot better weaponry!<br />  That's not to say the rest of the episodes are not as good.<br />  ALL the stories portray (somewhat graphically) what warfare is usually all about...<br />  (and not all of it ends happily)<br />  The episode ODD ONE OUT is a bit on the lighter side...more like the \\"WHY ME?\\" or MURPHY'S LAW aspect (what CAN go wrong, WILL go wrong) to being a Spartan soldier.<br /><br />  I admit to being a \\"newbie\\" when it comes to HALO, and the first TWO episodes (Origins I & II) give any viewer who's least bit curious about this \\"universe\\" a great \\"heads-up\\" as to what is going on and what everything is all about.<br />  I found the entire 2 part backstory very intriguing.<br /><br />  Heck, I might even have to go get an X-BOX and take some REAL \\"ops\\" in this game!<br /><br />  If you like good anime, you'll like this DVD.<br />  If you like HALO, this is right up your alley, and even if you just want to kick back and watch some good episodic story writing, this DVD has that, too.<br />  NOw...when are they coming out with a SECOND set of stories.<br /><br />  Definitely, two (Spartan armor-clad) thumbs UP!<br />  And, it IS \\"Master-Chief approved\\"!<br /><br />B.G.
0811833887|5.0|This is one of the gratest Art of that Pixar has to offer yet. I don't think there are many words that can describe the feeling you have when you first look at this illustrations. They are both beautifull and exquisit pieces of art.

0545123267|5.0|As a late 20's girl reading teen fic the highest i have ever rated anything (other then twilight series) was a 4. But this book was so well written. I loved the characters, the story was great, and the emotions were great. I actually cried a few times. I highly recommend this book to any one who is doubtful because it talks about werewolves. I almost didn't buy it for that reason. But Im so glad I did and now I can not wait for Linger (the second book)Now Im off to read the authors other two books. I have high hopes! :)
B000EU1PKK|4.0|Helloween are pretty much known as the originators of Power Metal, largely due to this and the two Keeper Of The Seven Keys albums.  Walls Of Jericho is a melodic, fast, rip-roarin' metal album, that at first listen you could easily call Thrash.  While it can easily hold it's own in the speed department against the Thrash bands of the time, it's obvious there's something else going on here.  Because it sounds a lot like Iron Maiden too!  So what the hell do we call this stuff?  That's Power Metal, kids, here in it's purest form.<br />Unfortunately it's a tad underrated, and I always felt it should be one of those \\"required reading\\" metal albums.  The Keeper albums are(and rightly so), but Jericho should be tacked onto those two albums as well, though the sound is a bit different from those albums-more raw and thrashy.<br />NO ONE sounded like Helloween.  These guys were(still are)a very original, talented and extraordinary band.  Checks out Walls and see where it started.

B002DMJLTE|4.0|Deep impact was one of the greatest disaster movies of the 90's. This 50GB AVC Mpeg 4 codec produces a crystal clear and vivid detailed version of this movie. From the trails of the blown up asteroid in the sky to the buildings collapsing, this is the blu-ray to own. Good job to Paramount for cleaning up this movie and for a great HD version as it was intended to be seen.
B002G4FQAC|4.0|Female fronted rockbands doen het goed in de christelijke muziekscene. Aan het rijtje  Krystal Meyers,  Fireflight,  Brooke Barrettsmith en  Stephanie Smith  kun je Paramore met plezier toevoegen. Emorock staat centraal op  Brand New Eyes, de opvolger van de platinum  Riot!  uit 2007. Riot! leverde de band een Grammy nomination nominate voor  Best New Artist naast Taylor Swift en Amy Winehouse op. Tot nu toe zijn de laatstgenoemden bekender geworden. De roodharige  Hayley Williams  blijft echter tekeer gaan. Careful en  Ignorance  zetten de toon. In Playing God sneert ze naar tv-predikers \\"Next time you point a finger, I'll point you to the mirror.\\" En in de single Brick By Boring Brick klinkt het \\"For a Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic\\". In Turn it Off protesteert ze \\"it's getting harder to believe in anything\\" en waakt ze voor \\"shortcuts and false solutions.\\". Producer  Rob Cavallo, met wie voor het eerst op de  Twilight soundtrack  Decode  werd samengewerkt, heeft prima werk verricht. Decode staat als afsluiter op het album. Rustpunten zijn The Only Exception en Misguided Ghosts, akoestische ballads. Gelukkig stopte de band er vorig jaar toch niet mee. In zowel Looking Up als Where The Lines Overlap blikt Williams verbaasd terug: \\"I can't believe we almost hung it up.\\"  Het dozijn songs zijn daarvoor ook te waardevol.
0307474275|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is a really good thriller. The story moves quickly, the books a page turner and the descriptions are really good. In fact the way the book is written makes it feel like a movie, and like most movies The Da Vinci Code isn't without its flaws. Their were several parts of the book that made me roll my eyes at how cliche it got. I think the worst part was when Sophie sees something that was right in front of her face in a painting, but no one else was able to. Also the ending wasn't that great either but I won't spoil it. Its a good thriller but it lacks in plot.
B002VECM4K|5.0|\\"Precious\\" is not a pretty story, but as Mo'nique said in her Oscar delivery speech, this could happen to anyone of any race. It is most definitely a story that needs to be told; many disadvantaged people have a tough time. Ignorance and abuse, both physical and mental, are well-examined (as well as the overt welfare abuse that is bringing our country down). The magnificent Gabourey Sidibe has dreams, though she's obese and abused; what can become of her if she doesn't make a move? I wondered why this film got an Oscar nom for Editing, until I saw the film itself. There's no question that director Lee Daniels was in love with his material (Oscar-winner Geoffrey Fletcher's script), and the load of talent he ran with. It's a journey of understanding, discovery, renewal, redemption and, ultimately, dignity that ALL young persons can and should relate to. Wonderful support from Paula Patton and Mariah Carey are essential to the catharsis, where the  magnificent Mo'nique meets her reality. Watch, absorb, reflect and think of this as a terrific depiction of someone who dreams of better things, while trapped in a life of despair. I will buy this DVD, if only to revel in the acting. Aside from some of the profanity, I would recommend all kids, who think they're at dead end, should take Precious' trip to contentment and happiness. Ms Sidibe is not playing herself. She personifies this character, in a feat of acting that is overwhelming. She would've been my choice as Best Actress.
0385340540|1.0|In a time when Washington power brokerage is making a shambles of democracy (and of course, when did it never do that) this book could have really critiqued/satirized the facistic consciousness of our nations \\"leaders\\", and shown much stronger a light on their greed, and criminal hypocritical idealism. Or am I reading his conclusion wrong? Instead, it valorizes their behavior! Which leads me to believe, never having read a John Grisham novel before, that he is just another cog in the corporate media machine. I'm sadly disappointed, but what did I expect? In the Society of the Spectacle, Grisham has turned out another commodity, and in turn, help to commoditize all of us. No wonder this country is being colonized from within!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I enjoy listening to music in my car.  This is perfect for me.  I love the harmonies and her voice is very distinct.  Enjoyed it.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|After reading some reviews by others, both positive, and negative, I decided to see this movie.  I absolutely loved this movie, and my only regret is not watching it sooner.    This movie is total Brain Candy, meaning it makes you think.  Eye Candy is nice, but Brain Candy is more addicting, and much better for you.    This movie truly does require that you pay attention.  If you miss a little, you will actually miss a lot.     As stated in other reviews, this movie is \\"slow\\" as in Silent Running, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and they're right. THAT'S THE POINT.     If you're a fan of 2001, and/or Silent Running, this movie is for you.     Sam Rockwell's performance is absolutely amazing. He plays \\"Sam Bell,\\" and also \\"Sam Bell.\\" Briefly, and near the end of the movie, he also plays \\"Sam Bell.\\"     This is NOT a popcorn movie. A popcorn movie is a movie with a very simple plot.   ie Watching the movie is something you do while you eat the snack.     I think that one of the best aspects of the movie is the fact that Sam Rockwell is just about the only physical actor in the movie, with the exception of a double for those scenes needing two Sam Bells. Even some of those were done with Sam Rockwell as both Sam Bells (a movie magic trick that's been around a very long time).   The only other time you see an actual person on the screen is near the end when one of the rescue team members opens the lid of the damaged rover with the dying Sam Bell inside.     Kevin Spacey provided the voice for the character of GERTY, homage to HAL 9000, of 2001. I believe that Spacey's delivery of GERTY was as good as Douglas Rain's delivery of HAL 9000.     As some have questioned, why would they send only one person to the moon?     Most of the \\"operation\\" was automatic, Sam being only necessary to put the tubes in the launcher, and hitting the button to send it off to Earth. Beyond this, it seems, his only other potentially time consuming task is repairing anything that needed repairing. Hence GERTY telling him that he's spent nine hundred sixty eight hours working on the model town.

1450539785|5.0|There are two things about Mary Shelly's Frankenstein that should be cleared up.<br /><br />1. Frankenstein was not the monster. The monster was \\"the Monster.\\" Doctor Victor Frankenstein is the monster's creator.<br />2. The subtitle, \\"the Modern Prometheus\\" refers to Greek mythology. Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans, which angered the gods. By doing this, he essentially allowed humankind to develop and become strong. But, as far as Zeus was concerned, he overstepped his bounds. This is the meaning of the subtitle: Dr Frankenstein tried to act as a god by creating a human and paid a steep price.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book and have only seen a film adaptation, you really should pick it up. As with most classics, there's a reason we still talk about it and keep reprinting it. Even the story surrounding how the book came about is fascinating: Shelly (then Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin), her soon-to-be husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron were stuck inside due to poor weather and decided to write their own supernatural stories. Byron ended up writing a short vampire-based story and what Mary turned out was the groundwork for Frankenstein.<br /><br />This really needs to be on everyone's bookshelf.
0307386171|1.0|I'm not so sure why so many people enjoyed this book! Admittedly, I am not one of those people who likes what I call \\"artsy-fartsy\\" books or movies. I read to be entertained and this one was not entertaining! I skimmed through the majority of the book because I was so bored. The only interesting part of the book was the bedroom scene. If you want to read this book, get it for free from the library!

0441013597|4.0|[[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]] is perhaps the most original and exotic sci-fi/fantasy epic ever. Set 20,000 years in the future, it portrays a future that resembles the Middle Ages more than [[ASIN:B002HWRYJE Star Trek]]. The galaxy is ruled by an emperor and several powerful feudal houses. [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]] itself chronicles the struggle over the planet Arrakis, source of the crucial \\"spice,\\" as well as the rise of a new politico-religious leader. Of course, for many, the stars of the book are the giant sandworms, huge creatures hundreds of meters long that ultimately create the \\"spice.\\"    Frank Herbert's writing style in [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]] is flowing and exotic. Each chapter begins  with a quite from history or religious books in the [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune] universe, putting the story in context. The book and dialogue are littered with dozens of \\"pearls of wisdom\\" (\\"He who has the power to destroy a thing controls it absolutely.\\")    I saw the David Lynch movie [[ASIN:B0007PAMR4 Dune]] before I read the book, and in a few aspects of the book [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]] were disappointing. First, the narrator reveals key information at points, ruining the suspense. For example, Yueh is revealed as the traitor to the reader long before any of the characters realize it. Thus, when we see the rest of the characters accusing each other (which takes up a good bit of dialogue during the first third of [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]]), it loses its suspense.     Also, some of the characters' powers are never really explained. Paul at times seems more like a computer, too perfect and calculating (for example, he detects a secret door in a room because of a change in wind patterns). Paul also sees into the future even early on in [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]]. I guess you just have to accept these things as possible in the [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]] world.    A few notes on the audiobook: I liked the audiobook version of [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune]]. The narrators do a good job changingvoices between the characters, as well as introducing sound effects and music to supplement the text. It did seem like some of the characters' voices changed (Baron Harkonnen goes from a deep voice to a British voice at some points). Nonetheless, if you don't have time to read the book, it's a great alternative.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Having been an avid fan of Hendrix since my first exposure in 1981, I can safely say that I have either owned or been through a large majority of bootlegs and most, if not all, of the \\"official\\" (I.E. Major label) posthumous releases.   I always chuckle when one of these releases comes out and the first thing people say is \\"Well, it's good but it's no \\"Axis\\" or \\"Electric Ladyland\\". Of course it isn't! The four albums Hendrix sanctioned in his lifetime are within the scope of how he wanted them to be. Only \\"Electric Ladyland\\" was the closest to how he wanted it to be and even then the record company fooled with the cover. Any posthumous release will never be within Hendrix's vision because he isn't here to oversee them.  So, what is the Hendrix fan to do? Cherish the fact that the man spent alot of time in the studio and left us with these gems to remember him by. The very fact that Hendrix is still an artist who, nearly 40 years after he left us, is a visisible icon is in fact partially owed to the fact that not only was he extremely talented, but that there's a wealth of unreleased gems that can be released today, for both new and old fans. Plus, I thank God it's not yet another live release. Those are good, but that's the majority of what we were offered by Warners and Capitol in the 80's. At least the live ones released by his family have been of a specific concert (\\"Woodstock\\", \\"Isle Of Wight\\", etc.) and a portrait into a very specific time-frame.  I don't judge any of these releases against what he released during his lifetime. That's an excercize in futility. I view \\"Valleys Of Neptune\\" as a snapshot of the period between \\"Electric Ladyland\\" and \\"Band Of Gypsys\\", and what a great snapshot it is! Most Hendrix fans are familiar with the work he did following the BOG experiment (\\"Cry Of Love\\" etc.) but this is a period not often documented.  The sound quality is impecable for what is essentially unpolished gems. The inside water painting instantly reminded me ofthe kind of art work one would find in early 70's albums, and it's a nice touch that they put this in there.  I think to build a somewhat complete picture of what Hendrix was trying to do in the studio, you should get his first 3 Experience albums as well as \\"First Rays Of The New Rising Sun\\", \\"South Saturn Delta\\" and \\"Valleys Of Neptune\\". Taken together, these 6 albums will give one a good framework in which to hear the progress of his studio work without having to slog through bootleg after bootleg of long-winded jams and unfinished takes.  I can never give 5 stars to any Hendrix release outside of the 4 he did when he was with us, but this one gets a 4 for the complete package of good art work, great sound and a combination of familiar tunes with some unfamiliar ones.
020530902X|5.0|I started to get down to the book based on personal recommendation. My professor told me that this book is a must-read and will help us go down to the same path he did. I wanna break the norm that scientists can't write well.<br />This awesome book was originally written by Willim Strunk Jr, in the hope of helping his students to write well in his class. To his great surprise, one of his students, E.B. White followsuit the clear-cut, lucid, easy-to-read guidlines and transcended the pocket book into a writing bible that's sold millions of copies to this day.<br /><br />The author provided lucid dos and donts , each with the correct and flawed demonstration.<br />Classic misused phrases include: per se, -wise, in terms of, interestingly, the fact that to name a few.<br />He also gave tips on properly using punctuations and where to watch out for.<br /><br />In the last chapter, he got straight to the point to provide tips for emerging writers and journalists:<br /><br />1. avoid overstatement<br />2. familiarity with the use of language will help us form our own style, so just follow the flow<br />3. there are no infallible, definite guidelines to abide by<br />4. use spelling check<br />5. avoid foreign language and colloquial expression<br />6. dont overexplain things<br />7. the use of fancy words or trying to be flashy, showy doesn't make you smarter<br />8. write in a coherent, consistent manner<br /><br />I had a great time digesting the wisdom within the book with pleasure and euphoria. I hope ya'll can find it helpful, and one day can all write like Strunk and White!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I am of the generation that grew up with Julia Child.  Appreciated Streep's stunning performance.  Incredible acting.  How does she keep doing it?  I think the primary appeal of this movie would be to the older generation.<br /><br />The premise behind the movie seems very gimmicky.  Not believable that someone cooked all those recipes in one year.  The food cost alone ----.  It's understandable that Julia Child's looked on the author with disdain.  But ignoring the gimmickry, we are left with a wonderful and heartwarming love story of both Julia and her husband, as well of Julia and her love of cooking.  Not the boring TV hostess at all, but quite a remarkable person.<br /><br />Loved the scenery.  For those that have not been to Paris, it looks every bit as it did in the movie.  It is a timeless city that did not plunder its architectural past in the name of progress. If you do just one thing in life, do Paris.  Bad English, but words that are meant to capture the spirit of the city.

If you like the guitar and seeing vintage video of guitar legends The Edge, Jimmy Paige, and Jack White you'll love this disc.  Part documentary, part Unplugged, and part banter from three vastly different musicians.  The video imagery is mostly good, but there is some old footage that has noticeable interlacing.  You may not care because the sound is phenomenal.  The best sounding music themed disc I've ever heard, great demo material for your system.  Very well done, and a must-have in my opinion.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", as well as his other two novels, so I was excited to read \\"The Lost Symbol\\".  While Brown weaves his mystery, intrigue, secret societies, symbols, and villains as expertly as ever, I think the novel was too long, with a lot of fillers.<br /><br />Harvard symbology professor (by the way, there is no such position at Harvard) Robert Langdon returns to solve another mystery.  Langdon is invited to deliver a speech in Washington, D.C., at the Capitol.  Upon arriving, Langdon realizes that there is no speech to be given, and witnesses a shocking event that sends him running through D.C., sometimes with and sometimes away from, the CIA.  Robert's millionaire friend Peter Solomon has disappeared, and seems to be in the hands of a lunatic who calls himself \\"Ma'lakh\\".  Langdon also seems to believe that there is a government cover up of something, and Langdon does not know who to trust, apart from Solomon's sister Katherine, a scientist who is about to have a breakthrough in a new science of noetics.  However, she also seems to be a target, as her science seems to be dangerous.<br /><br />Let me first say that Brown has not lost any of his story-telling charm.  However, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" does not even begin to approach the novels that made Brown a household name.  While we have the same protagonist and similar twists and turns, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" gets really slow at times.  It took me two days each to read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\".  It took me two weeks to read \\"The Lost Symbol\\", as I often had to force myself to trudge through the middle of the novel, telling myself that it must get better.  Get better it does, but at the very end.  It seemed like Brown had a good idea, rested on his laurels, did a lot of research, then wrote a novel haphazardly.<br /><br />All in all, I am quite disappointed with \\"The Lost Symbol\\".  While there is a lot of information in the novel about Freemasonry, as well as history behind the secret society, making me search further about the subjects, they were not well incorporated into the story line.  It almost seems that it would have been better if Brown wrote a history of Freemasonry, and not a mystery novel.  Recommended with caution.<br /><br />*** This review also published on Epinions.

It's an absolutely wonderful score. It shows the  power that music can create even when it is done with  a measure of subtleness. This is another very hard-to-find  CD, but it's worth searching for. Also it's by far the  best release of this soundtrack.

You will probably remember how excellently it is written, more than the details of the plot, but that over-all satisfaction will probably bring you to read the book again.<br /><br />I've read all but the latest Le Carre books, and, as many people have written, this is among the best of the lot.  Le Carre has this indefinable ability to write solid, dense books that totally engross the reader.  I don't think you will be able put down 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' once you start it.<br /><br />It is a bit dated now, with the demise of the Soviet Union, but since I read it before that happy event, I can tell you that it is a scary book.  The USSR in the 80s was indeed the 'evil empire' in spirit at the very least.  It was secretive, forbidding, and many horror stories dribbled out of it, not the least of which was the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended!  I give this book praise like few others.  This is the work of a writer at his best.  A treasure.
1554072840|2.0|This is an okay story for potty training.  Yes, it is a chamberpot and not a modern-looking potty, but my 25 month old had no problem understanding that it is a potty.  I like the story.  The only complaint, though it is a big one, is from my husband.  He is a very active father and doesn't like this story because it's all about \\"I, Prudence's mother\\" and there is no father in the story.  So this would be good for a single mother, but not for a two-parent family working on potty training.  We also bought \\"My Big Girl Potty\\" by Joanna Cole, and he likes that better because BOTH mom and dad help with potty training.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I've been a fan of the original series for over 30 years and have watched the original episodes so many times I've almost memorized every line. Now that it's out on blu-ray it looks better than ever. I have a high end 5.1 surround sound system and the sound quality is awesome. It adds a whole new dimension to the orginal episodes. What I liked best about these new discs are the enhanced effects. The only thing that really disappointed me when watching the original episodes was how bad the special effects were. The new effects are great and give each episode a fresh new look and make the action seem more intense and realistic. The enterprise looks much more like an actual space ship than a model and the planets look fantastic. Even space looks better. You can view each episode with original effects or the new enhanced ones, and you can toggle between both by using the angle button on your remote. So in summary even if you own the original episodes on DVD, it is worth purchasing these new ones, not just because the video and sound quality are so much better, but because the new effects give the episodes a great new look and actualy make them better.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|This show was boring, slow, inaccurate as apaloosas are in the north not the south.  I realize that this useage was just the name of the town.    I was hoping that the show was about horsea and assumed so, trusting that I had enjoyed other shows with these actors in the past.   I did not like that the heroes both fell for Renee (with her bulbous fake-looking lips) even though it was obvious that she was a sleezey character.  I like her better in comedy.  I like both Viggo and Ed in other shows alot!  Just not this one!
1401323820|2.0|I wanted to like this book. I really did. I absolutely adore the television show. Unfortunately, the book was... a sad, two-dimensional affair that I actually set down for several months right in the middle. And I'm the kind of person who usually reads a book in one sitting, so... yeah.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad, there were times when you could see a glimmer of the characters, some really good one-liners and a bit of zing, but overall it felt like someone trying way too hard (Including the names... Rook, really?). It might have worked as an episode of the show, because there was a decent enough mystery (though that's not what makes the show great, I think the way the characters work together is what makes that show click) ...but then there was also an eye-roll inducing gratuitous sex scene.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, unlike the show, which I recommend to anyone and everyone who will listen to me!
B001AII4TA|4.0|My 3 years old daughter loves it....specially from the part when the animals float away to madagascar....before that the animation is too verbal....hard for kids to understand....overall a very good presentation......\\"Move it move it move it\\" is a total fun song!!!

B000VNMMR0|5.0|all i can say is that i enjoyed all the die hards but this one was my favorite. Bruce Willis is back as John McClane to help stop computer terrorists from shutting down everything in the entire country and to protect a computer genuis from getting killed and down the road he has to rescue his kidnapped daughter. WARNING: do not get the blu ray it doesn't feature the unrated version. Also check out the SURROGATES I recommend this to Bruce Willis fans.
B00328G4V6|3.0|I gave it an additional star just for the excellent sound quality considering the age of the material.  I have said before SSD should've been a fan only release, thru web or mag, and this CD as well.<br />This CD should not be the 1st one you pick up as an intro to Hendrix; for if you do you'll never pick up another one.  Your reaction would just be \\"holy cow, why in the world is this guy considered the greatest guitarist of all time?  Because of this?\\"<br />Nope, not a must have for casual listeners.<br />This should NOT have been a major studio release.  This is not what Hendrix planned to release and Eddie and Janie know it.  The Hendrix gravy train is drying up, and they are throwing anything out there that will make $ for them.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the complete specials!  David Tenant is amazing and he actually breaks your heart when he says he doesn't want to go and then changes into the next doctor.  What a fabulous treat it was to enjoy the specials and to say goodbye to our beloved Doctor. If you are a fan you MUST watch the specials!
B0017T4IG0|5.0|I loved this movie, and caught it a few times on reruns, and have been looking for a copy since VHS days.  Looking forward to its release on DVD.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have a 4 year old son, so I'm definitely no stranger to the family-friendly genre of movies. Most movies I can enjoy along with my son, while certain others are just a bit too corny for even a young mother like myself to handle. So when I saw the previews for \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\", I knew my son would enjoy it (since he'll watch any movie that involves dogs), but I was a bit weary of it, especially considering the 'G' rating. Even most cartoons these days pass with at least a PG rating. So I popped the dvd in and sat down with my little boy, expecting to fall asleep halfway thru the movie, if not sooner.        But nearly an hour later, I was dead wrong. I found myself sitting straight up, unable to pry my tear-filled eyes away from the screen. I've always been more of a cat lover myself, but even my beloved cat Bitty couldn't hold a candle to Hachi's loyalty to his owner, Parker (well played by Richard Gere). Most dog or animal movies (such as 'Homeward Bound' or 'Air Bud') are fun to watch but are just too cheesy for me, but Hachi was able to move me to tears without being overly 'mushy'. It's based on a true story, so it's real as well as realistic, which made me appreciate it more. My son enjoyed it as well, but still too young to fully understand why the movie made mommy so sad. It is definitely a tear-jerker, but still inspiring and leaves you with a sense of hope at the end. Hachi was an amazing dog who inspired many people around him and brought out the best in everybody, including myself, but in his own mind, he simply just missed his best friend: He gives a new meaning to \\"man's best friend.\\" I encourage everybody of all ages to watch this film, I'm sure it will be a modern classic as timeless as 'Lassie' for years to come. Definitely in my top-ten movies of the year list!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I been a QT fan since Pulp Fiction. However, I must admit that I didn't get into Grindhouse, just didn't interest me. I passed on Inglourious Basterds because I thought it was going to be just another senseless violent QT ego-trip. I enjoyed the Kill Bills because it had great characters and dialog. But I had a feeling that his work was going down hill, becoming to mainstream. But, when I saw IB for the first time I must say I was very impressed by it. Great characters, awesome dialog, great acting, and wonderful direction. The only thing that would of made this movie better is if would have been shot in Black and White.    Also, the humor is very toned down in this, but if you watch the full length version of Nations Pride mini-movie on the bonus features you will seriously be on the floor laughing, its hilarious!!!
0451228731|5.0|Reading this book was like watching a movie where you sit on the edge of your chair and bite off your nails.  Daniel Suarez has an amazing sense for keeping the pace going while making your brain spin with the possibilities of a bot-driven world. I ordered Freedom about 20 seconds after finishing this book.
B001M72JC2|5.0|Ashton Kutcher plays young man who had blackouts as a child. Upon waking up, he could never remember what happened during the blackouts. His mom took him to a specialist as a child who recommended he start writing in journal. As an adult, when reading the journal, what happened during the blackouts would come back to him. He also realized he could change his past. But, every time he chaged his past he would screw something else up. This movie is awesome! watch it!
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Despite the off-putting movie title and the one-note railing against the system that has given the most people the most security and freedom in history, this is one powerful documentary, never boring, loaded with information that would astonish even the most determined Michal Moore detractor.<br /><br />Not clear if Moore believes that Capitalism is bad because it's born of greed or that it lends to greed. Also, when he suggests on the one hand that out of fear, Barrack Obama is labeled a \\"Socialist\\", then, on the other hand, suggests/implies maybe Socialism is worth a try, I got a little lost. Troubling, yes, but the film is well-paced and keeps the viewer involved. Footage of Congressman Cummings and of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Jimmy Carter, will ensure revisitation. [\\"Features\\" has the full length Carter address, which has 100% relevance for today. But by 1981, the exact antithesis of his words came into play, by the election of the anti-environment, pro-Wall Street, G.E. and Merrill-Lynch icon, Ronald Wilson Reagan, whose by-word was \\"de-regulation\\"].<br /><br />If the underlying message of the movie was more *let's keep Wall Street in check*, and less *let's copy Europe*, I would have given \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" five stars.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Avatar in 3D heralds a new era in the age of 'blockbuster' film, exactly as the Wizard of Oz did when it presented audiences with their first taste of colour cinema.     It's not the first 3D movie, of course. Disney's 'honey I shrunk the audience' has been out for over ten years. Beowulf also presented us with the first full length 3D feature film. However, Avatar gives us a fully computer generated, beautifully crafted CGI world which really does take your breath away. It puts Lucas's 'new' CGI swamped Star Wars debarcle to shame.     I feel sorry for anyone who can't appreciate the sheer amount of work, artistry and talent that went into shaping the world of Pandora. It really is a behemoth of creative talent and I applaud Cameron and everyone involved. Thank you for making 3D cinema all that it can be.    It may be some time until such delights tickle our fancy since true 3D films, at present, take so damn long to produce.    Now - as a 2D film, is this any good? Unfortunately it's just okay. The story is average and mimicks 'Fern Gully' and 'Pocohontas' yet adds a twist to the tale. There's tons of fresh ideas added into the mix, although many of the plot set-ups were quite obvious.     Still, this is a kids movie and 30 somethings like me have been around far too long, to the point we've become jaded and see things comming a mile off. It's not a patch on Cameron's Aliens, The Abyss or Terminator films. I have to say, I was slightly dissapointed Cameron didn't develop a completely unique story for Avatar. Yet, was still enthralled in the cinema.    In a few years time, when 3D technology is ready available, this will delight, as it did in the cinema. But, as a 2D feature, it can't deliver the same level of excitement.     Still, I can't wait for part 2 which is in the early stages of pre-production.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|One of the best parts of Daria was the music. If it's not there I won't buy.
B002VECM4K|4.0|A solid film that follows the late teen years of 'Precious', A young black girl from a seriously haunting and deprived background. For her whole life Precious has suffered relentless abuse at the hands of her mother, played by Mo'Nique, who does her best to strip Precious of her dignity and self-worth.    Gabourey Sidibe's note prefect portrayal of Precious, a detached, way below average and lackluster teen, drifting through life while unnable to connect or care about the world around her, is amazing. Her steady metamorphasis towards a future in which she has a glimmer of hope is very painful and real.     Precious was never destined for greatness, yet she was destined for something, for a life with a future and the knowledge that she has some value to offer the world, and that there are people that would care about her.     This isn't the usual Hollywood portrayal of someone who comes from nothing, conquers the world and finds her knight in shining armour. Precious is the journey of a girl finding her self worth while becomming distinctly average.    Mo'Nique, Precious' mother's performance really is something to behold, a triumph - acting genius. Her final sililoquy in which she reveals her reasons for abusing Precious is one of the most haunting and memorable performances ever. It will leave you torn, with a gut wrenching ambiguous feeling where you're not sure whether to pity or despise her. I still can't decide, but I understand why she became so lost and full of hatred.     This really is a must see film...
B00338QENI|5.0|I was engrossed by this story of medical shenanigans and the family who paid the ultimate price for such negligence.    The author's endeavor to paint an accurate portrayal of the incidents involved in culturing the Hela cells is mind boggling.The medical community seemed to have no regress concerning the Lacks' family with the exception of one or two subservient physicians who were in no position to make any changes.    Skloot's relationship with Deborah, the youngest daughter, was phenomenal. She gained her trust despite such overwhelming odds. Their friendship seemed one of mutual respect and a life long desire to uncover all the minute details regarding the exploitation of Henrietta's cells. But Skloot had to overcome years of doubt, misgivings, and distrust of anyone delving into family history.Putting it simply, Deborah was a tough nut to crack. Through her genuine warmth, compassion, and scientific knowledge, Skloot became a trusted confidant of Deborah.    The author's skill at telling this story in such a dramatic manner made me anxious to continue reading far into the night to unveil the events as they occurred.Her writing style is simple, clear, and to the point. This reads like fiction as one story line develops into the next. The emphasis is on the human interest side of this story rather than a scholarly approach. It is one of those books that you can hardly bear to put down. It was also with regret that the story came to an end.    It is hard to know that these same medical conditions exist as of right now that allowed this travesty to happen. Beware what body parts you part with and their final destination. It is rewarding in some small way for the Lacks' family to know the medical progress accomplished due to Hela cells. But some monetary remuneration along the way would have made all their lives a little easier.    You will not be disappointed with this book.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I completely understand why people would hate this film. The final act is such a violent swerve in pace and story, a bad misdirection, that it detracts from the whole.    However, the subduing soundtrack, mixed with some vibrant, beautiful, directing techniques had me transfixed.    The story is of the dysfunctional crew of the Pegasus. A deepspace craft whose sole purpose is to reignite our dying star. Much like Pacino's 'Insomnia' there is a strong sense of days, weeks and months bluring into one long day. The editing and direction conveys the lulling, tired and taught crew's emotions with vivid perfection.    I found a wonderful beat to the action, which is slow, akin to 2001 Space Oyssey. But the majesty of the voyage, the Pegasus, and the relationships of the fraught crew is very gripping.    It's a shame Boyle didn't have a great ending, as what he came up with feels a little like he had a great concept but couldn't fulfil the final act. That's probably a little unfair as it does fit well with the theme of finding and becoming God, the giver of life. Still, the Zombie-esque finale doesn't quite fit.      It's not a film for most, perobably a sunday afternoon film to snooze to in most cases, but I liked it.    Space is Man's final conquest. The nature of our species is to explore and discover. It's what drives us to evolve. Our Solar system is so close, yet so far from our grasp, and anything that brings me closer to it excites my senses.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is by far the Smashing Pumpkins best album, if not one of the best alternative rock albums of all time.  13 surreal, highly emotional tunes that I'll never forget.  And they're catchy too!  The album alternates between hard (Cherub Rock, Quiet, Geek USA, Silverf***) and soft (Spaceboy, Sweet Sweet, Luna), happy (Today, Rocket) and downright depressing-in-a-good-way (Soma, Mayonnaise, Disarm) and Hummer, a progressive rock tune that is in a class of it's own.  I fell in love with this album in middle school in the first half of the 90's.  Songs like Mayonnaise and Hummer are almost painful to listen to yet beautiful at the same time.  An album this great made many of their other albums, even the epic Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness pale in comparison.  In my opinion, the band just kind of fell apart after the first three albums.  If you like this, check out Pisces Iscariot, which is a compilation of B-sides that were written around the time this and their first album, Gish came out, it's very similar in style.

A strong start with Seven Nation Army, some noisy advice with Little Acorns, and my children's favorite song at the end, Well it's True that We Love One Antoher. Jack teaching The Edge and Jimmy Page how to play Seven Nation Army is a must see deleted scene on It Might Get Loud.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|\\"Battle Studies\\" won't take too long to enjoy.  The guitar work is excellent, with patches of brilliance here and there.  Some of the lyrics are very nice; some very subtle that need focusing on.  There is a certain honesty in the songs, a letting go on Mayer's part.  Best known for \\"I'm just a regular person\\" music are, I think, Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen.  Mayer is getting pretty \\"regular\\" on some of these songs.  It's a pleasure.  Many of the songs have parts that you will want to sing along with.  That is always a good thing, even though some will call it too radio-like.  Another area where some people will criticise is that there are \\"Mayer signatures.\\"  That is, the way he lilts up (music note)at the end of a lyric, the notes he plays in sequence (sometimes)are things he's done before.  Yes, sometimes.  And if you don't like that about him, I'd like to suggest you just go along with him on it.  Let him have his way.  What's the harm.  You will like this album.  If you listen to it 4 times over the course of 4 days, I'd wager you will come to enjoy many of the songs very much.
B00026ZG10|5.0|A slightly different role for Arnie, but seeing Eliza before she was a slayer on BtVS was a nice plus. The female leads role in this is quite a change from her usual roles. All in all fun, action, intrigue and quite enjoyable.
1400052173|5.0|This is simply an extraordinary book.  I purchased it when I heard a review on NPR and was intrigued by the science and ethics part of the story - but when I read it I was even more captivated by the human side of the story.  Rebecca Skloot obviously has the facts buttoned down - and this book will probably become required reading in university medical ethics classes.  The \\"Afterword\\" alone is a most fascinating review of the ethics and case law involved - but reading it without the color and nuance added by the preceding chapters would be missing the point.  The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is so skillfully woven through the science that the reader emerges at the end with a deeper understanding of the issues and a new appreciation for how human emotion plays a part.   This beautifully crafted book combines history, science and sociology lessons (along with some unanswered questions) wrapped in a rich and engaging storyline that is a pleasure to read.

B0031MA7RA|5.0|This was a gift to my future daughter-in-law. I am a male nursing student. As a result of reading this book, I have been deeply influenced to pursue neuroscience, with hopes to work in ICU, as my route to advancement. It is the only book I have ever read twice. My copy was a gift from a fellow student who knew it would have a profound affect on me in \\"my pursuit to be the best nurse possible.\\"     I was most moved by the very first item in Appendix B, in the list Dr. Taylor devised of \\"Forty Things I Needed the Most [in her recovery from the stroke] which states, \\"1. I am not stupid. I am wounded. Please respect me.\\" Dr. Taylor is an incredible inspiration and I intend to be a nurse professional who will make a difference to those who suffer brain trauma and require sensitive and understanding caregivers.
B001TW68P4|5.0|I was just a young kid during the mid 60's. But, I still remember many of the songs on this CD.  Along with my Beatles albums, the Turtles Greatest Hits was one of the first albums I ever bought. I bought this particular CD so that I could listen to these great songs while driving. \\"Can I Get to Know You Better\\", \\"She'd Rather Be With Me\\", \\"She's My Girl\\", \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\". Great stuff. One of my favorite songs is \\"You Baby\\". Yes, it's bubble-gum. But the song has that tight drum riff that grabs your attention from the very first beat. And Howard (Kaplan) Kaylan's screaming falsetto (just after the second bridge), is killer. These songs will lift your spirits in the manner of the early Beatles, Paul Revere and the Raiders,the Dave Clark 5, etc. These older songs from the 60's (as well as the 70's) put today's music to shame. Young people who only listen to the newer cr_p from the 90's and 00's are truly missing out on some fantastic music.  This CD is worth every penny.
B00007EDY5|5.0|When I traded my N90s for a D70, I lost the flash synch connector for my studio flash packs. This little connector slides on to the hot shoe connector on top of the camera and provides the PC synch port missing on many DSLRs. It also works great with my D80. I don't use my studio equipment very often, but this is an essential piece of the kit now.
B00014NE62|5.0|The amazing thing about the Merchant-Ivory/Criterion Collection 2-disc Maurice DVD set is the Extras. (The same film was just re-released on DVD in the U.K. by Film 4 with NO extras.) The 12 deleted scenes are a revelation, ten of which have commentary by James Ivory. The interviews with Ivory, Wilby, Grant, Graves and others, reflecting back on the film, add perspective. Wilby left a stage performance and started filming Maurice within days, with few read-throughs. We learn that Julian Sands from Room with a View was supposed to play Maurice, but became unavailable. I, for one, am grateful.<br /><br />Having seen the film before reading the book I was surprised to notice that the film episode with Risley being arrested is not in the book, but was deemed necessary to explain why Grant's character decides to \\"go straight,\\" and this is explained both in the DVD notes and in the Extras. In fact, the deleted scenes show that this subplot was taken even further, but then cut back. Also cut was a subplot involving Maurice's attempted seduction of a young houseguest. (The first cut of the film was three hours.)<br /><br />The film has received typical Criterion Collection quality treatment from a high definition scan of the interpositive that was then digitally cleaned. However, there are no obvious digital artifacts introduced, unlike the Blu ray release of Gladiator. Maybe there will be a Blu ray release of Maurice from Criterion eventually. They have released a Blu ray of Howard's End.<br /><br />This film directly followed Room with a View and is a suitable companion piece, though Maurice is darker. Rupert Graves, in the interviews, claims he apologized to Ivory for being so saucy in Room, but  was then put at ease when he was re-hired for Maurice. Both Wilby and Graves received many, many letters from grateful gay men, though neither is gay.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|I grew up on the movies of the 80s and this was always one of my favorites growing up.  I was shocked to learn of the death of Corey Haim just a couple of days ago.  I popped this into the blu-ray player last night to pay tribute to one half of the 2 Corey's - the Haimster and Feldog.  I'm not sure anyone could have imagined when this film was released that it would hold up as well as it has 20+ years later.  This is a classic vampire movie with good action, a good story line, and a great soundtrack to boot.  Not to mention that it cast of stars were all relative unknowns at the time - this was Keifer Sutherland's first major role in the U.S.  Grab the blu-ray version of this movie, put on the popcorn, and get ready for an enjoyable movie, 80s style.  RIP Corey Haim...
1932100660|5.0|This book is definitely a must for anyone who is serious about nutrition. It is based not only on a mountain of undisputable scientific evidence, but also on something even more compelling: common sense. I have been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and reading this book made me realize so many things I was doing wrong for optimum health. If you think you know it all, think again. Read this book. It will be the healthiest investment you will ever make. Thanks Amazon for a perfect delivery and an excellent product.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I bought this title based solely on reviews here, and had to remark how much I loved it. The huge twist 20 minutes into the movie initially left me feeling the movie would be a dud, but it then did a great job building the story and changed my mind.     I loved how it was filmed, and will test the black level ability of any TV. It even looked amazing on my 480p plasma. Some titles look awful when downscaled to 480p, but this one was beautiful and not grainy at all. I can't wait to watch it again on my new Samsung 1080p when it shows up.     Last, but definitely not least, the audio was amazing. It is detailed, complex, and will rock your house down. There is a 5 minute section where my subwoofer went where it had never gone before. My insides felt like they were liquifying, even at the moderate volume level I was using.     A real triumph, and I can't believe I just watched a movie that came out in 1998. It could have come out yesterday and it would still be heralded as great.    Buy and enjoy!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|After reading all the comments about this model,I decided to give these a try. I've owned these a few months now,and every time I listen to a DVD or CD through my stereo,I am truly amazed at the depth of sound you become immersed in. Watching a sports event makes you feel you are right there in the action. One note however: As stated by previous reviewers,these headphones must be handled with a little care. They're not made for rough handling. Other than that,these deliver the same sound as those costing hundreds more.

B0035G9ABQ|1.0|i own all the previous gorillaz albums (even the rarer d-sides, which is actually my favorite...) and was very excited for a new release - i'm a huge fan of the tripped-out-nonsense-dance type stuff in the past, and always thought the production values were top-notch and the spacey lyrics really did it for me.... all that has been traded in for a bunch of guest rappers and this one is a stinker. i find myself liking the background music, but once mos def or snoop dogg chimes in i forget this is supposed to be a gorillaz album. the hip-hop influence is overdone, too many rappers, and while the production is still there all the guest artists are over-blown and kill the whole thing. there's just too many guests and the album does not have a coherent feel to it - almost as if they were just seeing how many others they could pull in. it doesn't seem that unique anymore... a serious disappointment. there are still one or two tracks i like, but overall i have to give this album one star out of five because it's a sad way to see the gorillaz go out and i'm bitter about spending money on it on top of that.
1591841666|2.0|I just don't get how this guy is selling books. The Dip is the second book I've read from Godin and I just don't understand why people are willing to pay for what I see as nothing more than a really wordy blog wrapped up and bound in book form.<br /><br />I'm sure he's brilliant in his niche (just ask one of the members of his tribe).<br /><br />There just doesn't seem to be enough between the covers, for me, to see the reason behind the hype.<br /><br />If your goal is really worth the struggle, then don't quit.<br /><br />If your goal will result in you ending up on a cul-de-sac or falling off a cliff, then abandon the goal as early as possible.<br /><br />There, I just saved you the time and money that you were going to waste on this book.<br /><br />Keep going if it's worth it, quit and move on if it's not.<br /><br />Easy to write it.

0375842209|5.0|Oddly, I make my living teaching reading, but ended up listening on audio to what has turned out to be one of my favorite \\"reads\\" in the past few years.  Narrated by Allan Corduner, who gives \\"Death\\", our narrator, the perfect voice -- this book was so compelling I had a hard time turning off my iPod at the end of my commute!    I am not going to rehash the plot as that has been done hundreds of times here. Suffice to say this is a brilliantly told story about finding joy in the smallest things in life -- be they a miniature snow man or a stolen book about grave digging.  Add the very somber backdrop of Germany during the worst of WW II, and these small pleasures take on a deep resonance.    There are many themes running through this book but one of the most important ones is that you cannot make instant judgments about people.  It may be something as huge as not assuming everyone in Nazi Germany was evil or as simple as realizing the foster mother who swears at you non stop is really a very loving caretaker underneath her bluster.   In fact, \\"Death\\" may not even be what you think he/she is.    The Book Thief is also a very good \\"coming of age\\" story -- which is probably why it was branded \\"Young Adult\\" in genre.  But fumbling through adolescence while Nazis and Allied bombs are threatening your existence is not your average Judy Blume book.    This book belongs in any high school library, but it also belongs on many adults nightstands.
1423101472|5.0|This series was amazing. It's a fast and quick read (mainly because it is for little kids) but it's filled with action, humor and it throws in some romance.  The end of the series starts off faced pace, which I think a lot of other series ending books don't do, so that was great!  And it maintains a good balance of action and that humor and just \\"Percy Jacksoness\\" that made the series great.<br /><br />This book series has definitely been a great ride.  For some reason (not sure If I'm the only one), but I think the message in the book and at the end is great.  It deals with kids who have \\"broken\\" (not sure if that's the right word to describe it) homes and it sends a strong message that you still have to keep fighting through the pain you might feel.<br /><br />Anyways, this was a great series.  Made me laugh a lot, made me tear up a bit, and made me re-explore my old fascination with Greek mythology.  When I was in 6th grade I was a big Hermes fan, and Greek myth fan in general..  I even pulled out my old huge Encyclopedia of Roman/Greek Myths book a lot.<br /><br />Definitely a must read for kids if adventure novels are their sort of thing.  It's too bad Harry Potter was almost too popular because it sort of makes ever adventure book seem like it must be compared to it.. Which isn't fair.<br /><br />Anyways, I loved this series.  I'm definitely keeping it around if I ever have kids someday to let them read it.
1435114949|4.0|I purchased this EXACT same copy for $20 @ Barnes & Noble last summer... it is definitely a handsome book, but not worth anything near the $110 list price on here! I doubt the cover is genuine leather and the embossing is already beginning to peel on my copy; even though I read it often, I was hoping it would stand up to wear and tear a little better than it has. There are also several typos and very annoying \\"fixes\\" to a few of the Canon inconsistencies, such as the changing of the dates in Wisteria Lodge from 1892 to 1895.<br /><br />This is a great starter for someone who wants to read the complete short stories/novels, and does spruce up the bookshelf, but not the greatest or most accurate version. Besides that, the small print was hellish on my eyes.

B00328G4V6|5.0|THAT'S ALL - WOW!    As for the hoo haa over whether it is a money making venture, well it doesn't rank up there with the invasion of Iraq or the Wall Street swindle, but I certainly hope the family is turning some coin on this. This is how the man earned his crust, and all without ever taking advantage of anyone. I met Hendrix in a Holiday Inn in western Massachusettes the Monday night he was supposed to be on Cavett. He was exhausted from Woodstock and bailed on the tv appearance as there was a concert appearance in Mass that Tuesday or Wednesday. My father, my brother, our executive chef (who knew a thing or two about the chitlin circuit) and I asked him to join us in the restaurant for a meal. He was charming, genuine, gracious. My brother and I sat in awe as the adults talked of military service, earning a living on the road, bearing with the indignities of making ends meet. No trippy bs. Just a very gifted man sharing observations on a life. I hope his family makes a bloody fortune on this.    As for this disc, I'll go back to my unbridled enthusiasm. Shorn of the psychedelics, this is Hendrix in the lab creating. As time moves along, it becomes ever clearer what an incredible marriage he and Mitchell were. Cox was the more perfect bass player, but Redding had his merits as well. With Mitchell's passing last year, it is further reason to listen more carefully to what is going on here. The chemistry jumps out in numbers like the instrumental \\"Sunshine of your love\\" (listen even once and you'll forget whoever it was that first did that tune). Mitchell and Hendrix were as tightly in step with each other as Elvin Jones and John Coltrane. That intensity is all over this disc, and it is as much about the rhythm section as it is about the astonishing six string work on offer. The lyrics are moving away from the psychedelic babble of AXIS and radically towards the blues. And this is a blues album. While you'll hear ad infinitum that most of the tracks have appeared elsewhere (and anyone who tells you to buy a cutout disc at Target you can dismiss wholesale - typical Yank), Kramer and crew have effected aural wonders in the remaster and the disc sounds especially contemporary, like it was cut yesterday. It is seamless. That is the wonder of the technology. It is to the credit of Kramer that he then gets out of the way and allows the musicians to make their own case.    And the case is simply, 40 years dead, and Hendrix is still the best guitarist there's ever been. I haven't got round to the other re-issues, although I have enjoyed the blu-ray of Woodstock, again mostly because the sound is in fact hugely cleaned up. That is the reason for the exercise in remastering the back catalogue, seeing what is still in the lab, dusting off the ancient texts, handing through the ages the alchemy of making music in service to one's Muse. And for all the years he laboured for chitlins with the Isleys, I do indeed believe he and his family should make a killing. Why not? You know anyone more deerving? In Music? Didn't think so. Enjoy this. WOW! that's all.
1591843162|2.0|It's not that this is a bad book - it's an over done topic. Seth does his typical entertaining job of telling stories that illustrate ideas that are sometimes insightful, sometimes obvious, and sometimes over simplified to the point of being wrong, but usually motivational. I'm disappointed that Seth has turned away from doing that in the realm of marketing to doing that in the realm of personal development.<br /><br />I heard him speak at the launch of the book tour and someone mentioned that he'd been criticized for writing a self-help book. He replied \\"Self help is the only kind of help there is\\" If that were true, no one would need a doctor. As someone who was in the self-help world for quite a while, I know there are cases where it's useful. I also know there are cases where it blinds and limits people to focusing away from reality. It's like sugar - enticing, and yes our bodies need it, but those who love it most can be the ones who over indulge and are harmed by it.<br /><br />This may be an OK self help book (I'm probably too jaded to judge) but don't be misled. That's what it is, and I'm disappointed.

1933771690|5.0|As a mathematically challenged non-scientist, quantum mechanics will always be a mystery to me.  But at least the book, Biocentrism, has put even my limited intellect right smack in the middle of everything.  Why, heck, I might even be integral to the Grand Unified Theory of the Universe.  If I don't look out at the cosmos, it isn't there!  Don't worry; I'll be sure to glance upward every night just so the stars don't blink out. Biocentrism, as expected, provides almost no answers, but the new questions it asks are . . . fascinating.
1591843162|5.0|This is the first of Godin's books I've read, but I was very impressed.  I was approaching this read from the perspective of an educator, but Godin's bountiful wisdom seems applicable for people in all businesses and roles.      Some of Godin's ideas initially seemed pretty abstract (be an artist) but he does provide some concrete suggestions for becoming indispensable in the workplace.  I felt like you can apply 99% of his suggestion, and I cannot argue with any of ideas.  With the current economic situation in our country this book will certainly give you a leg up on the competition.    This was a fairly easy read, and if you have any motivation to become more valuable at work, Linchpin is well worth the $11.

0375842209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a LONG time.  The writing is beautiful, and the story is very poignant.  The way Zusak uses certain words and phrases together in a way you wouldn't normally is captivating.  As a high school English teacher, I have recommended this book to all of my students, colleagues, and friends.  The characters stay with you long after you have finished reading.  It is funny, sad, enlightening, and thought provoking. I believe that this book is destined to be a classic.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|An orchestral covers album from an aging prog rocker? Not surprisingly, \\"Scratch My Back\\" is, by turns, brilliant and odd. It's a sparse, stark, elegiac album of minimalist compositions that deliberately takes the listener out of his comfort zone. With Peter's cracked, soulful vocals hanging on John Metcalfe's sharp, aural landscapes, \\"Back\\" wears its concept like a fragile exoskeleton. It's a mournful and sometimes-thrilling performance that sacrifices synth for strings, easy hooks for meditation and gloss for exposure.      It's an effect that works stunningly on the album's most transformative tracks -- Arcade Fire's \\"My Body is a Cage\\" and Talking Heads' \\"Listening Wind.\\" The instruments simmer and soar under, not over, the rhythmic gravel of Peter's voice. In fact, \\"Cage\\" probably deserves comparison to Johnny Cash's \\"Hurt\\" in terms of passion and performance. No longer a tale of youth-fed angst, the song becomes an explosion of aged apprehension and disquiet. Peter's voice is so clear and fearlessly imperfect that he could be singing in a dark, haunted wood or in your own hallway.    Yes, the concept here is tenuous, but \\"Back's\\" successes are many. \\"Mirrorball\\" and \\"Book of Love\\" are gorgeous and lush, and \\"Heroes\\" is a wonderful, slow burn. The album's biggest revelation, though, might be \\"The Power of the Heart.\\" A mostly unknown and beautifully written Lou Reed song, \\"Heart\\" was ripe for discovery. Once you've heard Peter's rendition, you'll wonder why you've never heard it before.    But the album's imperfections are hard to ignore. It's difficult to sustain an entire disc of mostly-morose chamber music. In fact, I guarantee that many of these songs will reveal themselves most fully when thrown onto a mix tape, shuffled into a playlist or featured among the rock and electronica on a movie soundtrack. And it doesn't help that the last two songs, \\"Philadelphia\\" and \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out),\\" seem less like thread-bare confessions and more like off-key whimpers. Only in the final 8 or 9 minutes of this stunning, one-hour album does the exoskeleton finally start to buckle.    For every person who calls \\"Scratch My Back\\" moving, meditative and poignant, there will be someone who calls it overwrought, ponderous and contrived. You may absolutely adore these lovely bones, or you might resent them. Just do yourself a favor and shuffle a few of these tracks into your playlist. You might be surprised.    BEST TRACKS: \\"My Body is a Cage,\\" \\"Listening Wind,\\" \\"The Power of the Heart,\\" \\"Mirrorball\\"

B000B8QEYC|2.0|I find it strange that Enya left Clannad for their turning to pop because this album is pretty much pop with a mixture of a couple of New Age tunes. Instead of the gentle drone of the synthesizer or a lovely orchestra, this is very loud and almost at times drowns out Enya's voice. The lyrics also are very poor. Roma Ryan has written beautiful lyrics before, but these on this album are weak and lack the power seen on Enya's earlier works. Loxian, while being an interesting addition, doesn't sound much different than the mouth music used on songs like \\"The Celts\\" or \\"The Longships\\".    \\"Less than a Pearl\\"- pretty but the music threatens to drown out the singer    \\"Amarantine\\"- catchy tune, horrible lyrics    \\"It's in the Rain\\"- lacks emotion    \\"If I could Be Where You Are\\"- lacks emotion    \\"The River Sings\\"- catchy tune but the music is disorganized and threatens to drown out the voice    \\"Long Long Journey\\"- pretty    \\"Sumiregusa\\"- pretty, but it doesn't sound like Enya. Is she bored with singing in Gaelic?    \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\"- catchy tune, horrible lyrics, lacks emotion    \\"A Moment Lost\\"- pretty but not as good as her earlier songs    \\"Drifting\\"- I miss the sound of just Enya's piano that she did on songs like \\"Watermark\\", \\"Shepherd Moons,\\" and \\"No Holly for Miss Quinn\\"    \\"Amid the Fallen Snow\\"- pretty    \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\\"- best out of the Loxian songs on the CD    The album is pretty, but this not Enya's best. It's way too pop and lacks the power and beauty of her earlier works.

0060574216|5.0|It's too bad that a book of this nature is necessary.      What sense does it make that the two sexes speak two entirely different languages?    Actually, it makes no sense whatsoever, yet it's true.      However, when you think about it, a book has to be written, on whatever subject, by either one sex or the other, since there are only the two sexes, right?    So how can one sex write about a subject that he can't possibly comprehend, inasmuch as he is the wrong sex to write about it?    What a diabolical situation, created by the Mastermind of Creation, to forever confound us mere mortals.    But, we have to trust that two minds (one male, one female) collaborated on this subject, so as to enlighten the decidedly unenlightened vast majority, so that we may endeavor to understand one another, although I still feel that it is an impossible task.     I mean, try as he may, will any man ever understand any woman?    I don't think so.
B00280LYIC|4.0|It's no Harry Potter, but, that said, it definitely has it's own niche for children's lit that is also adult-friendly.

And it brings ancient Greek mythology to a younger, typically uninterested generation. It's a good read for any age.
044656740X|5.0|It's truly shameful that this subject is not taught in school.      How many lives are unnecessarily blighted because people don't learn to handle money (my own included).    Intead of living in deep debt, constantly worring about paying the bills and dreading the mailman's visit every day, we could all be living the good life, happy and prosperous, exploring our talents and desires to the fullest.    Instead, we find a nation full of debtors, with bottom feeders living off of the ignorance of the vast majority, by keeping them indebted and enslaved.    But you have to start while you're young.  That's why it should be mandatory to be taught in school.  When we are young, and our heads are full of thoughts of anything but learning, we only learn what is absolutely pounded into our heads, so why not put something in there that makes sense, and will help us actually live our lives prosperously, instead of forever treading water, financially, all our lives?
0374531269|4.0|A very disturbing true story that I feel everyone, every kids should read. War, is a horrendous thing. It kills lives, destroys homes, wipes out the glows in the eyes of the surviving people.. Ishmael's words are calm, quiet, almost nonchalant yet extremely powerful. I had tears in my eyes reading it. It was painful to read the book, it was painful to even imagine what he has gone through in the war. I'm glad he survived the war and has a better life now. There are still many, too many people suffering in wars all over the world. But one got out is better than none got out.<br /><br />I read about the controversy surrounding this book (on the internet) half way reading it. It's up to people who and what to believe, even with evidence, just like Michael Jackson's trial. And I believe Ishmael Beah. I just do.<br /><br />A link to Ishmael's words on the doubts of his experience in the war.<br />[...]<br /><br />I gave the book a 4 star because it ended a little too abruptly. How did he get to US? Did the people in the Embassy helped him? How did Laura become his mum? I know in the book, it told that Laura and Ishmael got close with each other during the conference. But I would have like to know a little more detail after he got to US and stay with Laura. And perhaps a little about his life then when he was writing the book. Was he still being haunted by nightmares? Was he able to get a good night sleep? I'm just wondering...

Even though the info on the back of the box says that it's from 2007 and is formatted for widescreen TVs, it's still two-sided (you have to flip it over halfway for the other half of the movie) and it's literally NOT made for widescreen televisions.  Of course since it was opened I couldn't return it unless I exchanged it for the exact same thing, which also happens to Warner Home Video's policy according to their website.  No thanks, I'm good.    If you want it to actually look NORMAL on your widescreen TV, you have to spend twice as much and get the special edition...great job there Warner...

B0017ANAZO|4.0|I discovered this film one day while I was flipping channels.  When it started I thought it seemed like it would be a short-half hour situation comedy.  But as it developed into a two-hour film I found myself very interested, especially when, about a quarter way into the story I realized that there was not one single man in the cast.<br /><br />This is the story of women's friendships and the two main characters are played by Meg Ryan and Annette Bening.  Annette Bening is cast as a sophisticated career woman and in the first scene she goes for a manicure at Saks Fifth Avenue and hears the manicurist gossiping about Meg Ryan's husband who is having an affair with a girl who works at the perfume counter.  Annette tries to keep this information from her friend but eventually it comes out.  Meg Ryan looks beautiful in this role of a suburban housewife whose world seems to fall apart.  Candace Bergan is cast has her mother and her role is interesting too.<br /><br />Soon, I got involved in the story.  The characters were a bit overdone but I definitely related to them.  And I loved the happy ending too.<br /><br />Later, I discovered that this was a remake of a 1939 film which was supposed to be a real winner.  I never saw that film (but maybe I will someday) so I had nothing to compare this version to.  This might not be the greatest film in the world but not every film is destined for Academy Awards.  Some are just simply to enjoy.
0307269752|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Larsson's first novel, however I laughed until my stomach hurt over Blomkvist's visit to Australia. Did he get his research off an Aussie who was having a lend of him? As far as I know, only cattle are run on stations close to Tennant Creek, its too rugged and too hot for sheep. As to the chickens and pigs, there are no commercial chicken farms in the Northern Territory.  The only pigs around are dangerous feral monsters that would happily eat any of the chickens that weren't taken by the feral dogs and cats. Most of the locals don't drive jeeps - they prefer helicopters, motor bikes and horses to round up the cattle. The preferred vehicle, at least when I lived there was a Landcruiser.  The scene where they are shooting the sheep was just hilarious- and seemed so wrong. There is no mention of working dogs or Aboriginal jackaroos. Blomkvist eats a meal of mutton at a local pub(maybe he had a lamb roast) and drives on a back road  to the station)they are pretty much all backroads or the one main road, the Stuart Highway.) Then there was the name of the local area - Muckawucka? (Or was it Wuckawucka- I listened to an audio book so I don't have the text to check.) I may be the ignorant one, but I can't find a place of that name on any map. It just sounds like a joke. I was just waiting for a mention of drop bears to complete the gag.<br /><br />While this was very amusing, it did impact a little on my appreciation of the novel. From that point, on I wondered about the legitimacy of the details given in the rest of the book. However, I still enjoyed the novel very much and recommend it. And to any Australians who read it, expect a good laugh towards the end.
1595141715|5.0|The book is heartbreaking and really enlightening. Every seemingly small gesture or action by another person in Hannah's life led to her suicide. While the ultimate subject, suicide, is depressing, there is a lot to learn from this book. The offhanded jokes, comments and labels that we throw out so thoughtlessly can snowball into a huge mess and we need to realize the power we have in each other's lives. What is that phrase? \\"All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.\\" We need to stand up when we see wrongs and we need to take the risk & reach out when we see people in pain.<br />I loved the book because of its message and am really glad that it was geared toward teens.

Damon's Ripley is rather more innocent at first than Highsmith's original, but it works with his gee-whiz looks and plays well against Law's spoiled rich boy. Law, Paltrow and Blanchett are both excellent and believable, as is Hoffman, whose range becomes ever more apparent. These are in fact five of the very best from their generation of actors, and writer/director Minghella gives them plenty to work with here. That he saw their talents clearly well before they'd started to peak only adds more lustre to his genius on display here.<br /><br />Italy has rarely looked better; clearly Minghella hadn't had enough of la bella Italia after making The English Patient, and he sure knows how to set up a shot and use natural Mediterranean light to greatest effect. And you've got to give the guy credit: he picks the best books to make flicks of. His writing and directing does much justice to Highsmith's novel, and in the first viewing I've had of this since seeing it when it came out, I was never bored even after two hours. The homoerotic edge of the script and Damon's performance is just enough to provide some extra edge here, and makes the ending that much more chilling.<br /><br />Some reviews here complain about that aspect, and wish they'd been forewarned that there were elements of gayness here, but it's hardly overwhelming and is key to the plot. Then again, if even hints of gayness offend you that much, being offended by this movie might be the least of your issues.<br /><br />Overall, combining the gorgeous Italian locales (all shot in country) with an excellent plot and script, and adding some very fine acting, one ends up with a superior murder non-mystery worth watching for any number of reasons. Ripley is one of the best noir-type films of the past couple decades, and well worth watching for any fan of the genre, or these actors, or Italy, or just solid movie-making in general.<br /><br />This will age far better than most films of its decade, count on that.s of its decade, count on that.
B000EXDS5M|3.0|This picture-postcard of a film is meant to be a kind of comic elegy to the Western genre, and, with the iconic charisma of Newman and Redford and William Goldman's pleasingly elemental script, it almost pulls it off. But the most effective part of the film is the second act, in which Butch and Sundance are hounded (literally) to the ends of the earth by a relentless posse that is rather obviously meant to represent the looming 20th century and the passing of an era. The overall feeling one is left with is a squirmy sense of impending doom. Hardly the stuff of whimsy.

B002WY65VU|5.0|.. but a lot of fun. The first seconds could mislead your opinion about this movie. But as soon as Woody Harrelson takes over its real fun and a lot of surprises you wouldn't have expected. This is not another trash movie, this is intelligent fun. Thanks to Mr. Murray for his appearance!! One little drop of critizism: At the end the ideas seem to be consumed, the punch is gone - but finally I could live with it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|She is a real good singer.  She has a great voice and noone can match the quality of it.  She sounds almost like Barbra Streisand.  I love the CD.
B00080Z53O|5.0|Mar Adentro es una película excelente. Esta versión es hablado en español, con subtítulos en Inglés. Recomiendo la película. Muy bien actuado y producido. Definitivamente la calidad de los Oscar en mi opinión. Música original y algunos clásicos viejos también. Bien hecho por todos lados.     I bought it at the referral of a Spanish pen-pal who lives in that part of Spain. She said it was a tear-jerker and it is, but well-worth the hankies! The people speak a little bit too fast for me to pick up all the words, but the subtitles fill in nicely.    I give it a Thumbs Arriba!   Lee Paul

1572816112|5.0|I absolutely love this deck, I have been studying and doing tarot for 12 years.  Though at first sight this deck may appear to stray too far from the usual Rider Waite meanings, it actually adds to them...such as the Chariot card, (so much deeper and makes the meaning jump right out!!!)  BUT...if you choose to buy or order this deck make sure it's printed in ITALY, NOT CHINA!!!!!  I have a deck printed in Italy, and the cards are absolutely stunning.  They are glossy, rich, vibrant and printed on quality flexible stock that is easy to handle and shuffle.  After seeing my cards a friend of mine decided to order a deck herself and received one that was printed in China and she was furious when she compared hers to mine!!! The one printed in China is made on stiff, lower quality card stock which makes the deck way thicker than the Italy deck.  They are very difficult to shuffle without feeling like you might bend one in half. But that's not the worst of it, the most disappointing difference is the quality of the imagery.  The China deck's images are way less vibrant and have a completely matte finish!!! The China deck is extremely low quality and renders the deck mediocre and unimpressive.  Make sure your deck is printed in Italy so that you can fully enjoy the experience that is the Deviant Moon Tarot.  A truly captivating and stunning tarot deck.

0525951113|3.0|Most great books possess three things: a beginning, a middle and an end.  Unfortunately, Daniel Suarez's DAEMON only gets two thirds of the way there, containing a great, exciting beginning, a mostly solid middle (that only flirts with the thought of going completely off the rails), and an ending which apparently does not exist outside of the confines of the (separately published) sequel.      DAEMON takes its name from a concept in computer science, a process which performs some predetermined task but usually invisibly and in the background.  In the case of this thriller, the daemon has been written by a dying millionaire game designer.  Using the techniques he has honed over his years of coding,  he gives his daemon access to bank accounts, news reports and all forms of communications.  His daemon quickly begins to control larger portions of both the physical and the virtual worlds as it pulls remote-controlled military equipment and more and more of the world's economy under its power.    The book starts off a little rough and unsteady.  The reader is presented with a seemingly endless introduction of new characters who take a little bit of time to assert themselves as unique individuals.  Fortunately, it settles down and quickly becomes a lot better.  I enjoyed all of the network and hacking stuff, seeing the daemon as it processed, evolved and prepared for its next move (very [[ASIN:1416507787 CUCKOO'S EGG]] in places).  Even the extended use of a MMORPG virtual reality (which was something I was expecting to find trite) worked well in the story.    The beginning and middle of the so book were so absorbing and interesting that I found myself in the position of cheering on the daemon and hoping it wouldn't be outwitted so that I can see what it would do next.  Suarez really did a great job with the central concept.  The daemon had some parallels with terrorist cells.  Even when the protagonists scored an apparent victory, they would be unable to turn that smallgain into anything meaningful.  It made for a very fun game of cat and mouse.    That said, the book did seem to fall apart by the end in a process that was so gradual that I cannot quite pinpoint the exact moment in which it occurred.  At the beginning, the book is a fairly reasonable techno-thriller based on one part reality, one part rational speculation and one part fictional license.  By the end it's just a lot of shouting and violence with characters simply yelling action movie dialog at each other while guns blaze and explosions reign.    The fact that the book seemed written with the sequel already well in mind appeared to have had a massive and unfortunate effect on the story's third act.  Still, first time author Daniel Suarez is to be commended for his prose.  His use of language is very compelling and intelligent; difficult concepts are presented clearly without coming across as patronizing to those who were already familiar with them.  I just hope that the sequel follows up the role playing game portions and leaves the first-person-shooter bits behind.      (As I complete aside, there was a plot point I had been hoping to see.  I thought it might be fun to watch the daemon try to route around the damage caused by something completely random or genuinely unpredictable.  In other words, I was curious to see what it would have done if [[ASIN:0553382586 Asimov's Mule]] had wandered into the plot.  It didn't happen, but that was really only a minor disappointment.)
142313494X|3.0|I thought this book was going to be something different than it was.  Although obviously geared for juveniles, I had just finished The Iliad and was primed to read more on Greek mythology. So once I started reading this, I decided to finish it. Of what value Greek mythology (and religion overall) is to modern society is certainly questionable--Jeopardy's esoteric questions perhaps.  In grade school I had little interest in mythology, but as it is part of our history, it is important to know it simply because it is part of the evolution of religion.  As for as this book is concerned, it is simply fantasy, as is religion.  I recommend The Power of Myth and the Encyclopedia of Mythology for anyone wishing to learn more on religion and to get an overall understanding.
B002N8A14M|4.0|I bought this primarily for the arm band feature. I use it for the clip. It turns out the armband is not my thing but the case by itself is great. The clip is very secure on my rear pocket. I did make one modification to the case. I ground it down around the headphone jack to allow for a cable with a fat molding to work interference free. One slight bummer is that I have to remove the lower half of the case to dock it. It does come apart easy but I am worried I will lose it.

B002XMGGJM|5.0|This film was very good overall.  You can read alot of other posts to get an idea of what the movie is about, but it boils down to Jamie Foxx is an ADA with more interest in his conviction rate than actual justice.  Gerard Butler is a peaceful married man who is attacked in his home, his wife and daughter are murdered and he begins to see the criminal justice system as it really is; full of faults.  So he takes the law into his own hands and begins systematically killing everyone who was involved in his case.    That being said, the movie was very gory and the suspense levels were through the roof.  I was impressed with all the acting and the story was well written and character development, while taking a back seat to getting the movie off to a great start, was sufficient enough to make you care about these characters.    My only issue with this film is Jamie Foxx.  In other roles, like \\"Ray\\", he does very well.  His character in this film is a very pompous attorney and I see Jamie Foxx as a very pompous man anyway.  It was like being force fed raw onions in that if you like onions, its not so bad...but if you don't like onions you will likely spend the evening with vomit in your throat.    Overall, I give this film a 5 star rating but only because I can handle being force fed onions.    Despite the fact that this rating is for the film alone, I must add that Amazon provided an almost automatic transaction.  I really love Amazon and spend lot of time and money on this site.  So I became a Prime member :)
B0025KW29U|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Neil Patrick Harris, ever since his child-star days. He truly shines in this amazing work, in both acting and singing, as Dr. Horrible. The supporting cast does an amazing job as well, as Captain Hammer, and Penny. Don't miss this one, it's one of my favorites!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I just bought this cd earlier this month after hearing \\"Brick By Boring Brick\\" and a couple of other songs on youtube. Here's what I thought:    Careful(5/5) - This is one of my favorites. it sounds like some of the earlier songs of theirs that I've heard (Crushcrushcrush & That's What You Get were the only two I'd ever heard until recently).  Ignorance(5/5) - At first, I didn't like this song. After listening to it a couple times, I decided that it was good. I mean, the lyrics are kinda dark, but I like that it's fast paced.  Playing God(5/5) - \\"Next time you point a finger, I'll point you to the mirror!\\" That's my favorite line in the song. It's a bit slower than other songs, but I think the lyrics are awesome.  Brick By Boring Brick(5/5) - This is another favorite of mine. The \\"Ba da ba da ba da ba da\\" part is really cool.  Turn It Off(6/5 :D) - This is my absolute favorite off the album. It's kind of deppressing, but in a good kind of way.  The Only Exception(4/5) - Isn't my favorite, but I like the bridge and the end.  Feeling Sorry(3/5) - Another not bad song. It wasn't very catchy to me.  Looking Up(5/5) - The \\"Whoa oh-oh-oh, whoa oh-oh-oh\\" part is catchy. I like that it's a bit more upbeat than some of the other songs.  Where The Lines Overlap(4/5) - I like this song. The instrumental ending is really cool. Only problem was that it just slightly reminded me of \\"Looking Up\\".  Misguided Ghosts(5/5) - I like the lyrics, and the acoustic guitar is really awesome. I just wish it was a bit longer.   All I Wanted(5/5) - I really like Hayley's vocals in this. It's really sad, though.    All in all, if you asked me wether you should buy this album, I'd tell you yes. Absolutely. I'm really glad I bought it, and you will be too.

B000000OAC|4.0|First thing I wanna do is tell ya'll something:    It took me about 10 years to get into News of the World, and I believe I FINALLY accomplished it.  It happened earlier tonight.      For whatever reason, News of the World was a very difficult album for me to get into.  Whether Queen changed their songwriting approach for this effort, or for some other reason, the fact remains that for the last 10 years, I'd constantly go back, play this album to see if the music has finally clicked, and it NEVER would.    Now it's not like I played this album frequently the last 10 years- it's just every so often I'd pull it out from my stack of records, and see what happens.      ALL this time... and you wanna know what needed to be done in order to finally make it click?  I had to play it twice in the same day, haha.  I even smiled earlier today when I'd realized I finally got into it after all those agonizing years.    Anyway, I'm about sick and *completely* tired of the first two songs- \\"We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions\\".      Every single sporting event in history (at least here in the United States- don't know about Europe, Canada, and Australia) apparently believe *these* two songs is the very best way to celebrate an important victory for a team, whether it's baseball, football, hockey, or whatever else.      Thanks to all those many sporting events, this has permanently damaged two potential great songs, and I will never be able to listen to them the same way ever again.  I'm sick of them.  Even classic rock radio did its sickening part in destroying them forever.  Unbelievable.    I always start the album at track 3- \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\".  An AMZING heavy metal number- if you had any doubts Queen couldn't stand up and rock with the best of them, well, you surely haven't heard this blistering example of heavy metal.   Solid riffs and vocals- brilliant song.    \\"All Dead, All Dead\\" contains a really good vocal melody courtesy of Brian May  By the way, on an unrelated note- what IS that album cover supposed to be?  Something from War of the Worlds?  A huge robot smashes human beings?  I like the painting inside the album sleeve that shows people trying to run away from the thing with a close-up look of the detailed expressions on their faces.    \\"Fight From the Inside\\" is another really solid rocker, though not quite as heavy as \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\".  I like it a lot nonetheless.  \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" is not a disco song.  Someone tried telling me it was, and well, I don't believe it.  Memorable vocals.    \\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\" reminds me of ZZ Top's \\"Tush\\" and that's a good thing.  \\"Who Needs You\\" is a strange Grateful Dead-like experiment (I suppose- I'm probably wrong about that) and it works thanks to the memorable vocals, \\"It's Late\\" is a wonderful display of bombastic brilliance.  Probably the best song on the album.  \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" is quite an underrated track- it grows on you with repeated listens so don't dismiss it right away!    I definitely prefer the albums Queen released before this one (especially Queen II- what a masterpiece THAT album is) but Queen was still stuck in a nice creative groove, so expect each track on News of the World to include a distinctive sound and style.

Clooney flies all over the country to fire people.  The movie shows George in an airport, shows the name of the city on the screen, Georges fires someone, George is back flying again, city name on the screen, fires someone, etc., et....  It never goes anywhere of interest.  The fact that he and the supporting female character were nominated for academy awards is beyond me.  Neither put in a \\"wow\\" performance.    Don't bother with this one.

B002ZG97RE|4.0|Matt Damon has become one of the most politically active Hollywood types out there so you know a film about Iraq with him in the lead role is going to have a strong message. This is of course the case with 'Green Zone.' Damon plays Chief Roy Miller, a US Army WMD specialist whose unit scours Baghdad for the weapons in the opening weeks of the current Iraq war. Paul Greengrass, who did the last two Bourne films with Damon, directed this, and like Bourne Ultimatum, GZ has much of the shaky handheld camera work that makes the film a bit difficult to watch at times. Not recommended if you suffer from motion sickness. That being said, it was a decent but not exceptional film. Basically, Miller finds out he is on a wild goose chase to find the WMDs and once he discovers that the whole reason for the invasion is basically bogus, he decides to do something about it. I like Brendan Gleason (he plays a CIA officer here) but I thought his accent was horrible here which threw off his whole performance. Damon, Kinnear and others give good performances but I thought the film's message was a bit too blatant and redundant. That being said, the film puts the lie to those who would accuse the war criticizers or skeptics of not \\"supporting the troops.\\" If anything, it's a condemnation of those who callously put our heroic men and women in harm's way for the sake of achieving their own political purposes. 3.5 stars
0141442468|5.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read.  It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.<br /><br />The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it.  Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul.  Fascinating, no?<br /><br />I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.<br /><br />I felt the tragedy, deeply.  The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.<br /><br />It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch.  Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming.  I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.<br /><br />By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it.  And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain.

B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Here we've got a professor of organizational management and a high-powered management consultant, both young (at least from the perspective of my advanced age), who can actually write in an engaging and entertaining way -- and they deliver a message that is truly both profound and practical. Switch is one of the most useful books for managers written in recent years. Combine it with another excellent recent book, Drive by Daniel Pink (reviewed earlier in this blog), and you've got an unbeatable set of tools for anyone faced with the need to engineer change in a business, nonprofit, or government.<br /><br />What is most remarkable about Switch, aside from the authors' amusing style, is the profusion of fascinating examples drawn from a wide variety of sources, from academics in many disparate fields to self-help literature to personal experiences. However, unlike the authors of most how-to literature, the Heath brothers refer again and again to examples cited earlier in the book, deepening the reader's understanding and making it far more likely that she'll recall at least some of these fascinating stories.<br /><br />Switch can serve as model for writers of how-to books (and I ought to know, having written a slew of them myself).<br /><br />As the subtitle makes clear, Switch is about how to bring about change -- in an organization, in a spouse or coworker, or in yourself. The book is organized into three principal sections, corresponding to the three dimensions of successful change-making: the intellectual (referred to here as The Rider), the emotional (here, The Elephant), and the specific course of action (The Path). This concept is based on the image of a person riding atop an elephant and trying to persuade it to move onto an unfamiliar course -- a daunting proposition, as you might imagine. In each of the three sections, the authors cite a substantial number of examples to illustrate the significance of respecting these three elements. Additional examples tie all three together by showing how individual people have successfully engineered change -- often very far-reaching change in business or government -- by pursuing an approach based on an intuitive understanding of the three dimensions. Fascinating!<br /><br />Just in case you didn't notice: the brothers Heath collaborated on another excellent and useful book three years ago: Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die.<br /><br />(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)howing how individual people have successfully engineered change -- often very far-reaching change in business or government -- by pursuing an approach based on an intuitive understanding of the three dimensions.

B001GM28HO|5.0|I'm not like some of these other people that go into great detail about the nuances of every song and what \\"they\\" believe the artist was trying to say or invoke.  I just rate and judge things as they appear to be and leave the psycho analysis to others.  I don't remember when I first heard about Lady Gaga, or exactly what song it was that perked my interest, all I do know is that it took me back to the decade of the 80's, but with a refreshing twist; perhaps just the quality of the recording has improved so much.  Like all albums there are tracks I love and others that let's just say might not make it onto my ipod.  If you liked 80's music along with a techno spin that I highly recommend this album. Since hearing her I've pretty much pulled together most, if not all of her library; which isn't that much. In my opinion if you really want to appreciate Lady Gaga as an artist you need to listen to the acoustic version of Pokerface or No Floods. To me this is where you can really hear and appreciate the lovely voice she has.  For me I would love to hear her do an unplugged set of all her music; that would be an album I'd buy in a heart beat.

This is a wonderful recording especially for those of us who weren't able to see the original.  It was almost like watching the play on stage.  I would recommend it to anyone and have.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|For what it is and when it was made, this is a forward-looking film that gives a simplistic but appealing message about treating workers fairly and not building empires on the backs and on the blood, tears, and sweat of others.  Obviously, many parts of the world are still not that progressive and probably never will be, human nature being what it is.<br /><br />The idea of blending a robot with a human is also  fascinating and is explored to some degree here, both literally and metaphorically.<br /><br />The score seems to be pervasive and rather distracting, and the quality isn't all that good. But these elements can be overlooked for the overall purpose.
B000VS6PD2|4.0|Alive 2007 is a recording of a live concert performed at Bercy in Paris France on June 14th 2007. The CD has won various awards including a Grammy for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2009, an award that it most definitely deserves. It is truly a masterpiece of electronic music. Daft Punk is an exceptionally well-known band in the electronic genre with an individual niche in the market. However, Alive 2007 steps outside of their traditional style and resorts to new methods for putting on a concert. Most people have heard their most famous songs including \\"One More Time\\" and \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" but this concert takes these great songs one revolutionizing step further. Rather than just replicating their regular songs on stage, they mix their old popular songs together to create new ones. This is the theme for the whole concert where each track is a blend of old and new, creating a refreshing but nostalgic feel for the listener. Daft Punk is recognized as a classic artist in the realm of modern electronic music however this album takes them to the next level in terms of what they are capable of.    It is interesting to note that both Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo are French born and raised in relation to the history of electronic music. Even though the roots of electronic music date back to the ancient Greeks, many of the techniques used in modern electronic music are the result of the influences of a few European men. One of these men with significant influences is Pierre Schaeffer. Pierre Schaeffer was responsible for the creation of Musique Concrete where he would use a tape recorder to capture a variety of sounds from different sources and create music out of these individual noises. He would spend hours cutting and splicing individual sounds on a tape recorder to create his final works. One technique that he pioneered through his work is called Objet Sonore where he would repeat these individual sounds creating a longer piece. This notion, though more sophisticated and refined in terms of quality is present in almost every track in Alive 2007. We can hear the same few words repeated multiple times or even just the same pattern of synthesizers.  Herbert Eimert was another great influence on modern electronic music despite being enemies with Schaeffer. Eimert was a famous German electronic composer who took a completely different approach to his music though seems to have had an equal influence on Daft Punk's works. While Schaeffer used sounds from the real world, Eimert pioneered the use of electronic or elektronische music, sounds created solely from electronic sources. It is easy to see the influence that he had on modern dance music including that of Daft Punk who rely heavily on the use of synthesizers. It seems like almost every single track on this album has a synthesizer or root that can be traced back to one of these men.    Daft Punk's can be described as the ultimate modern electronic group. They are constantly trying new things and have successfully taken the world by storm. Starting with humble French roots, they have managed to make a name for themselves all across the world. Alive 2007 is just one successful step in their path that will continue on into the future, I personally cannot wait to see what they bring out next.    DJP3AR
0307473708|5.0|It is hard not to become fascinated with the life and thoughts of the serial killer Dexter, who follows his adoptive father's code about not killing the innocent.  Dexter would also never harm a child, and he was himself victimized as a small child as he witnessed his mother's terrible fate.  The use of the first person narrative was a good choice on the part of the author, and the producers of the Showtime series were wise enough to borrow it.  Dexter, as a sociopath, can only imagine or try to imitate true emotion, while maintaining a facade as a boyfriend, brother, and blood spatter specialist for the Miami-Dade police.      Dexter is so intelligent, articulate, and oddly charming that one almost forgets his true nature as a human monster; he is fully aware of this nature and can only try not to get caught while indulging what he refers to as the Dark Passenger.      If you like the book, you will surely enjoy the series, which features the same characters.
B000088DTS|5.0|I first heard about Delta Goodrem when I was on holiday in Australia.  Her voice is amazing.  Every song on this album shows the range and depth of that sweet voice.  There's not one song I don't like.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album
B0035G9ABG|5.0|This is a great album. Not quite as good as Demon Days, but almost. At first listen, I only thought it was OK, but all the songs grew on me. The DVD is cool enough. I was expecting a bit more, really, but it's worth the extra cash.
1401300529|1.0|At the beginning of this book I thought this might be a very interesting read, but barely into the first chapter I already find that without any factual information he starts bashing General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Instead maybe he should do a little more research concerning the Commander. MacArthur wasn't the problem in Korea it was Liberal administration attitudes who tied his hands. I largely think General MacArthur possible could have ended the war allot sooner if they had let the commander DO HIS JOB and save lives! Again if you had read transcripts from back then you would find that he never did anything without the approval of the JCS or President Truman (who often would wait long periods without making decisions). The author really should go back and read some biographies concerning the General such as \\"Reminiscences by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur\\" maybe this would have changed his attitude. I was hoping even though the Author works for the New York Times this might actually have been an unbiased work \\"I was wrong\\"!

B000LY3EZ8|5.0|It's hard to believe that this album is over a quarter of a century old now, but it stands up to the test of time. If you want to know what the 80s were all about, this album definitely deserves to be in your playlist.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|I love Tarantino and World War II films. So that made this a must-see movie for me. Then I saw it and it became a must-have movie.  I love it.  It puts a different spin on WWII movies and the action moves.  I got caught up in the film.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is absolutely an enjoyable movie and I highly recommend it. Loved everything about it.  The first time in a quite some time that Disney has produced a movie equivalent to Beauty and the Beast, etc.  There is the good vs. bad and the good guys win as is Disney's theme in their great animated movies.  My grandaughter and I have seen it twice and are eagerly awaiting the DVD.  Thanks Disney!!!
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|The actor is good. I like the crowd. thats the only reason i bought it.
B00005L94W|5.0|This CD is an absolute must have for Kitano fans. The CD includes the best tracks from each of Kitano's movies from the 90s which they collaborated on. Several of the tracks alone are worth the high price. It's worth every penny.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|even though the graphic has been improved but they add so many other things in the story which i think  make the movie became boring, but the story is more complete and make sence, so it's pretty ironic.  i bought it becuase i'm a fans of FF i thought that they would add more fighting scean but nop.
0061922315|5.0|Shilpi Somaya Gowda's first novel is, in one word, delicious! Gowda's gift as a writer is that she is able to use simple language to create such authentically strong, yet flawed characters and to paint such a vivid depiction of complex, modern India. Like a good dessert, this book can be devoured in a few bites and leaves you wanting more. I'm already looking forward to this author's next novel.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I don`t understand how could John Cusack, Amanda Peet and Woody Harrelson lend themselves to make such a bad movie.

006621131X|5.0|I loved listening to Patti's music in college and was at every show I could get to when she came anywhere near Portland Oregon.  I came across her book and have just finished reading it.  I've read the various reviews that come before me.  I think most are likely right....good and bad.  It just depends on one's perspective and what you felt like you wanted from the book.  What I loved about this book was Patti's writing style, the way she tells stories and her openness about her life.  Not too many of us would share as much as she did and none of us could share as well as she did.  The book also brought me back to her music and all the misses I have about what her music.  I learned some of the real meaning of the words behind the music that I love.     If you like good writing, have memories of Patti's music or prose, or simply want to read a good book and story, then pick up this book, sit back and enjoy.
0316017922|5.0|I have been so tired of reading similar books, and I came across \\"Outliers.\\"  Even though I don't agree everything about \\"born in right time & right place,\\"  if you always seek to leave a mark and intellectual growth gives you tremenous joy and happiness, you will certainly enjoy this book.  I got an audio book version. Malcolm's voice is also very pleasant to listen.  Out of all his books, I enjoyed this one the best and \\"What the dog saw\\" the least.
1600242197|5.0|Lone survivor is an awesome book.  I like the audio version and played it back and forth to work.  What a story.  God bless the Navy Seals.  They are true heroes.  Marcus Lutrell is THE MAN!
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I watched this movie at the theater, and was struck how well it was put together. How well the actors protrade the real people the story was about. I Thought Rob Pattinson did a outstanding job playing his part. His acting ability is outstand . I am purchasing this DVD to add to my collection cause its worth having. Bravo to the actors and the director for making this film.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Got this yesterday. I was so excited! Few hours of listening,only thing I can say is if you love music, buys this. The sound it reproduce is very clear. Enjoy your music. get this. I have shure srh240 and shure se210. Those things are history.<br /><br />After 6 years, still singing beautifully
B000002A3T|5.0|I don't care if you say it ain't true Pink Floyd. Listen with your ears. I don't care if the band behind the music is Pink Floyd or Chicken Soup. This is an outstanding set of songs. The more you listen to each and every one, the more captivating they become. Strip off the names and stereotypes from them. This is just good music. One of the best albums I've ever heard. I like every song.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|i also enjoyed lost season fifth season.i have all the seasons but i need the final season sixth.

B002VECM4A|5.0|On the surface \\"Precious\\" could be another sad movie about tragic circumstances of the poor, uneducated, etc.  What I walked away with from the movie was the following:<br /><br />1) the complexity of victimization, that in this society in an effort not to resolve the true core issues of our day, we spend all our focus on painstakingly analyzing why the victim is in the circumstances they find themselves and how its their fault.  In Precious, we witness the victimization of a young girl, and not till the end do we see the victimization of the mother, and we see nothing of the victimization of the father.<br /><br />2) failures of a society, that in a society that doesn't spend all its resources in maximally developing its citizenry, but instead creates multiple layers of winners based on categories of class, race, education, wealth and sex - you instead maximize victimization.  Obviously a highly victimized society, were any victim can then turn perp, but for the most part doesn't turn activist is one that can be better managed and controlled and continually denied basic dignity.<br /><br />3) choices, that each and every day we all have the choice to make our lives and the lives of others better from our vantage point. On our job when someone is being targeted, do you have the courage not to join in for fear you will be next.  In your relatoinship when it becomes clear that it has taken an unhealthy turn, do you have the courage to seek support and the relationship's end instead of allowing the robbing of years of your life.  As a professional doctor, lawyer, officer, etc. with the special priviliedges you enjoy in this society, your actions can be catastrophic to an individual's life, do you have the courage to not fall into the trap of feeling that the lives of others don't count, and therefore don't warrant your compassion or whatever real and safe assistance at your disposal.<br /><br />4) justice, that each and everyone on this planet is deserving and in so believing that all of our resources must be brought to bear in order to bring about peace, justice, and the upliftment of life wherever we find ourselves.  That it is not victims that are weak for they have truly survived unimaginable horrors, weakness are in the actions of the perp who neither possess the compulsion or imagination to do something other than harming/maiming/raping or killing of others as well as those who simply walk away (physically or mentally) when their resources could be of use.<br /><br />Precious wasn't simply about the abuse of a young black girl; it was about the abuse and victimization of all people everywhere.  I commend the writers, producers, actors and actresses, etc. having the courage to make this movie and in so doing - make a statement.<br /><br />Now what are we going to do??
0060899190|5.0|I loved reading other people's secrets and was amazed by how many emotions the random statements evoked.  The secrets made me feel sadness, humour, pity, despair, disbelief and revulsion (the wife that puts boogers in her husband's soup when she is pissed off with him); as well as making me recognize myself and ponder my own untold secrets and the freedom of letting them go anonymously.  I love the idea of gaining control over something by making it concrete and putting it outside of yourself.   I think it is an absolutely wonderful and insightful project.
0061703257|5.0|I noticed that the trailers on TV for the movie Shutter Island looked really intriguing. I saw the book in the bookstore and realized the book was by Dennis Lehane so I picked it up. And never put it down.<br /><br />This book moves along so well that you are half way through it before you look up. It's a tense psychological drama that will suck you in. In the book, Teddy, is out to get the bad guys. He is on Shudder Island looking for an escaped mental patient, and he also has a secret agenda. But, as far as the girl goes - how in the world did she ever get out of a locked room, around a bunch of orderlies, out of the hospital ward? She left a secret code that Teddy decodes because he is a Marshall and worked some code in WWII. Teddy and his partner encounter all kinds of strange things on the island, but once the mystery is solved they can't wait to get off. Getting off the island proves a little difficult.<br /><br />This book blindsided me and I thought it was a taunt, fast reading mystery! If you want to escape where the world isn't all as it seems or want a book that will keep you guessing, this is it. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed all of the characters and the creepy atmosphere on Shutter Island. I really enjoyed reading a book as tightly written and spellbinding as Lehane has written here. I wanted to start over once I finshed the book because the only problem was - I finished it too fast.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|All of you who were very critical of the 2nd movie were probably expecting the same carbon copy of the first movie. The bottom line is: these are two entirely separate movies hence the number 2. Nothing is ever the same. No cd is ever the same. No movie sharing the same name should be the same. I guess it's the natural progression....or de-evolution of things. The movie is good in it's own right. The sterotypical mexican was a bit of a twist but not much off from Rocco from the first flick. The replacement for Agent Smecker was....sexier, but nonetheless from the same vein as Willem Dafoe. The history of Il Duce was interesting.....anyways. I firmly believe that this movie, though extremely different from the first one, is still good in it's own right.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Some viewers want a Michael Bay-style sucker punch to the senses, a film delivered so obtusely that interpretation becomes nearly meaningless.  Like a roller coaster, it's just about the ride.  Others prefer the intellectual or psychological, a tale that slowly develops and allows viewer imagination to dictate not only what is transpiring, but also whether or not the content is, indeed, frightening.  Given the fact Paranormal Activity falls into the latter category, I'm somewhat surprised by its relative success.<br /><br />Rather than taking a step ahead, PA takes a sidestep with the handheld camera concept made popular by Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.  Avoiding too much of the rapid movements sure to induce epilepsy and migraines, PA provides a terrifying tale of a couple's cursed home.  The majority of the film is Micah talking into the video camera about a demon freeloading in the house while his girlfriend Katie self-loathingly impersonates every bad Cathy comic ever puked onto newspaper.  The only worthwhile parts are the sleeping scenes for two reasons:<br /><br />1)  When they are scary, they allow the viewers to anticipate and work into frenzy.<br />2)  When they are boring, they allow the viewer to catch a quick cat-nap while Katie acts paranoid.<br /><br />There are a few unnerving, slowly paced scenes shot while the couple slept that could substitute for the worst insomnia commercials ever or the best advertisement for single beds in adjoining rooms in history.  Overall, however, it's just an Ouija Board clich&eacute;, which is to say that there is more meat in the marketing than on the bone.<br /><br />Jason Elin
B000LC3ID8|2.0|The first two outings of the Jigsaw Killer were ingenious, creative, and very entertaining. The puzzle and Grand Guignol elements used in both raised the bar for the slasher genre. So it's sad that SAW III is such a disappointment. The ingenuity has gone, the plot (what there is of it) is incoherent, and the characters are underdeveloped and their motives dubious. There's plenty of gore here but not much else. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's slickly done.
B0030LLAFU|4.0|For all people who are interested in Japan, it's culture and history the film is a must. The CGI-effects look pretty cool. The story is thrilling and the historical characters complete the picture of a \\"what would have been if\\" - world. The movie is one of the best japanese films I saw the last years. The only thing reducing the stars to 4 is the cyber-futuristic world. I think the traditional castle of Osaka and traditional samurai would have fitted better.    The fact that Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu are presented as white noble knights with no faults is arguable. Also the decision to present Toyotomi Hideyoshi as the evil, guarded by futuristic knights with european amor does not seem historically correct. But that film does not claim to present \\"the true story\\". So I think it is an interesting film, who presents a possible alternative to the historical events. Watch it!!!
B00006JU7T|5.0|Ever heard of Al Pacino? Well, I'm sure you have. Ever seen Scarface, The Insider, Heat? Or how about Dog Day Afternoon, The Panic in Needle Park, or Scent of a Woman? Yeah, he's been in numerous movies ever since the early 70's, and I'm sure you recognize at least his face. But in case you haven't noticed, Al Pacino is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of 20th-century cinema. In fact, he's one of my favorite actors of all time, and there's a very good reason for it: this guy can really act. He's been parodied several times on film and on TV, but that's because everyone knows how good he is. From The Godfather trilogy to Insomnia, his performances are MORE then just solid gold. A professional method actor, he simply becomes his characters, whether they are fictional (Ricky Roma) or real-life (Lowell Bergman). He's not Al Pacino in The Godfather trilogy, he's Michael Corleone in the Godfather trilogy. He's not himself in Dick Tracy, he's \\"Big Boy\\" Caprice. No matter how you look at it, this guy is a living legend among actors. However, if Glengarry Glen Ross or Carlito's Way doesn't impress you enough, then maybe Serpico will.<br /><br />When The Godfather was released back in 1972, it made Pacino, who was unknown at the time, a movie star. Studio executives already saw him as a \\"profitable\\" performer, but it looked like Pacino was concentrating more on cinematic material rather than money, because his next movie didn't look and feel like a typical Hollywood-style film. Serpico is based on the real-life story of Frank Serpico, a cop who refused to adapt to the corruption that took place in the NYPD. The film was made back in the early 70's, and the budget looks pretty modest from the looks of it, but that's beside the point. What really matters is how mesmerizing this movie is. This is a carefully-directed tour de force that showcases not only Pacino's spectacular acting talents, but also gives us an incredibly solid character study of the man who would become famous in police departments everywhere. Here is an individual who is honest and is fully dedicated to his work, but who is also tormented by the fact that the people he is working with are secretly breaking laws. This would result in him fighting against corruption, with some severe sacrifices along the way. I must say that Pacino plays the part perfectly, of course. The appearance, the mannerisms, and the ANGER of Frank Serpico are shown with real strength and heart. This is one of his greatest roles.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that this movie showcases young Pacino at his best, the movie is photographed beautifully and written extraordinarily well. Director Sydney Lumet breaks away from over-the-top action and suspense and delivers with a slow and steady pace, which I think is really appropriate for this kind of film. The supporting cast (Barbara Eda-Young as Laurie, Tony Roberts as Blair, John Randolph as Sidney Green) is all-around excellent. The music by Mikis Theodorakis is a pleasure to listen to (except during one specific sequence, in which the music sounds as cheesy as the theme for a 70's cop show).<br /><br />After my first viewing of Serpico, I instantly fell in love with it. It has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time. I think that the movie is going to get better and better after repeated viewings. In conclusion, this is a great movie, and if you're a fan of Pacino, then you have to see this film. Too bad, though, that the DVD has now been discontinued. You'll have to buy a new copy as quickly as possible, or just purchase a used one from here or elsewhere.<br /><br />Grade: Aamous in police departments everywhere.

0307454541|5.0|I loved it from the get go. It was captivating with humor and great descriptions.Very easy to read and held your attention.  As soon as I finished it I wanted his other book, The Girl Who Played with Fire. So sad that author  died young. What made it a bit different is that it is set in Sweden. You learn alot about Sweden and the culture there.
B001HN694K|5.0|It's dazzling. Burton, Elfman and Depp haven't lost their \\"muchiness\\" at all. See it. Buy it.

B00164KYV4|5.0|I loved the concept of the movie regardless of the big casting of actors. Some story lines are so true and I can relate with some its a great girlfriend night watch movie. Wasn't expecting it to be good
0385341008|5.0|A lovely romantic book.  It took me to a place and time that I did not know that much about, but enjoyed very much learning about.  I highly recommend this book!
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Beyond giving hope to those that are easily tongue tied the music of Jason Mraz offers creativity that is rarely seen today. A Fantastic blend of various styles of music w/o copy yet embellished with melody and rhythem. This is no parachete and Pina Colada island walk. The music is vital,vibrant and surprising making a Beautiful Mess out of the all rest.

142313494X|2.0|I am one of those adults (well, younger adult) who is looking for something close to Harry Potter. This does not come close at all, and I'm sure almost nothing ever will. Still, I was looking for a good adventure and this series seems to be doing well. I forced myself to read three-quarters of this book, and I've given up, it's just too bad to finish. The author is obviously a beginner storyteller, it's painstakingly so. This book and series may be okay for children under fourteen- as it's supposed to be. But Harry Potter appeals to all, unlike this book. I am a fan of Greek/Roman Mythology, and know the myths somewhat. So I could see how shallow the story really is, and I could smell a tie-in a mile away.     From what I read, I have these negatives to say: The story is told in first-person which ruins it a lot for me, the dialogue is overall lame and cheesy. It is also very, very childish. Which is okay, because it's a children's/teens book! But some things would even make a teen not want to read this. The author takes the easy way out of a lot of situations he brings the characters into. For example, he either ends the chapter, or says things like \\"Somehow, we made it back to the Amtrak station...\\" Really? Come on, be an author. Also, I found it gruesomely annoying when he used the word \\"monsters\\". Who actually uses that word to refer to things? It's acceptable in picture books for toddlers, but you gotta come up with something better than \\"Oh no, it's the monsters!\\" The book sometimes reads more like a history/myth book, he just ties in the myths so everyone knows the stories. Which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It's also very slow-paced and predictable. The (few) characters are very shallow, there's no depth to anyone.     So overall, I will not be finishing the book or the series. I hear the movie is also a dud. And I would not recommend it if you're looking for a good story, and/or good writing.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|It is a great series that starts with this.  It was very exciting and interesting, but it definitely got better as it went on.
B0035G9ABQ|3.0|I gave this album a chance and came out with about 4 out of the 16 songs do I truely enjoy. The problem is that they are trying too hard to gain recognition from the US populous by adding well known artists into the mix. Snoop dogg and the Gorillaz? The music sounds just as bad. However, the pieces that are true to Gorillaz style with Albarn lending his vocals against quirky yet catchy melodies are what keep Plastic Beach from going belly up. Most of the songs are down tempo and mellow which wasn't really what I was expecting from this group. If you're looking for the cold side of the Gorillaz pillow you should give this album a try. If you miss the good old days of G-Sides and Demon Days I recommend downloading the songs \\"Rhinstone Eyes\\" and \\"Stylo\\" and passing up the rest of this uninspiring cd.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I've been a big Bale fan ever since the release of his 2000 film, American Psycho. Before that, I really didn't understand any of his work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was in American Psycho where Christian Bale's presence became more apparent. I think the scene where he chops Jared Leto up is the actor's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three scenes. Christy, take off your robe. Watch the brilliant ensemble acting of Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe. You can practically hear every nuance of every voice. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of thespian craftsmanship, the sheer delivery, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the scene with Chloe Sevigny. In this scene, Christian Bale addresses the problems of abusive political authority. Him trying to feed a kitten into an ATM machine is the most moving film scene of the 2000s about monogamy and commitment. The scene is extremely uplifting. The lines are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in movies. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your *beep*. Christian Bale's solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially movies like The Machinist and The Prestige. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Christian Bale works best within the confines of this movie than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is American Psycho, a great, great movie. A personal favorite.<br /><br />New York Matinee called it \\"a playful but mysterious little dish\\".
0785134352|4.0|Set in the 'real world' or at least a slightly more real world than usual, Kick Ass is the story of a 16 year old comic fan who decides to become the world's first superhero.  He promptly ends up in the hospital beaten to a pulp.<br /><br />But he comes back, inspiring others on the way.  Within six months Myspace, Youtube and the airwaves are full of his exploits.  Soon Kick Ass, Hit Girl, Big Daddy and Red Mist are taking on the mob. Injuries, blood and death follow.<br /><br />The story suffers a bit in the 3rd act where, after 100 pages of telling us no one can do the things Batman does, Kick Ass becomes your basic Batman or Punisher comic where a teenager and a ten year old girl take on armies of hulking mobsters and win.<br /><br />But Mark Millar's script is witty, John Romita Jr's art is gorgeous and the premise is fresh enough to make up for its pedestrian ending.<br /><br />A word of caution, this is definitely rated R, with foul language, blood and graphic injuries.  Definitely not for kids.
143350393X|5.0|I am a big fan of the ESV translation and I am also a big fan of study Bibles. I have been looking for a long time for a study Bible based based on the ESV, and when I found this one I was immediately taken with it. This Bible is not only a good resource but also a great value too.<br /><br />Obviously, a good Bible is one that is accurate, more than anything else. I have done a lot of research and have found that the ESV is very accurate and is also quite readable. For me, the readability is important (though not quite as much as the accuracy), so the ESV is a very happy balance for me. It is my main translation for study. I do supplement my study with several other translations too, which is a wise practice for anyone serious about knowing the Word.<br /><br />The study notes and maps within are, in a word, awesome. Frequently there are notes for individual verses but also there are notes to cover whole sections and passages too, and it is not unusual to find both. The annotations are frequently historical notes and tidbits of information that has been obscured over time but when applied in context make the verse(s) in question really come alive and take on deeper meaning. Maps typically are in color and have contextual notes tying them to the section in which they are found.<br /><br />After the Book of Revelation are a few sections of reference materials that are very useful for study. There are sections on Biblical doctrine, Biblical ethics, Bible study and interpretation and many more. There is a very interesting chart that shows what OT verses are quoted in the NT and there is a small concordance too.<br /><br />The ESV Study Bible is also accessible on the web, and included with this printed edition is an access code that grants access to the web version. This is an incredible deal - no matter where you are, if you have internet access you can get to the ESV Study Bible without lugging it with you.<br /><br />The ESV Study Bible is my primary Bible for reading and study. It is based on a good translation, it has excellent study materials and it is available in two forms. From a consumer perspective this is a great deal, and from a student's perspective this is an awesome resource.slation, it has excellent study materials and it is available in two forms.

1933771690|5.0|Biocentrism was relatively easy reading on matters that are so incomprehensible to many people. It goes against the grain of our intuition-even for fairly educated people with scientific background-to get us on a higher plane of understanding of the world. It has done this in an almost quantumesque way.  Many of the points Dr. Lanza made on Consciousness being the ground of everything including matter, space and time were alluded to over thousand of years by the various ancient religious texts especially the 5000 years old Vedic ones. However, these texts made pronouncements as opposed to proofs. While Biocentrism may not be considered as absolute scientific proof of its assertions on Consciousness in the scheme of things , Dr Lanza has done more than many in this great little book to lead us there.  Thank you  Reepu D.Singh, P.E.

B002VECM4A|3.0|This movie is \\"ok\\" at best; not the worst I've seen lately and not the best. Compared to the other Oscar noms that I have seen, it is a middle of the pack film.    The movie's two biggest strengths are the acting by Mo'Nique and the gritty dialouge that adds a depth to an overall unsatisfying plot. The movie's plot begs the audience to feel every emotion possible in under two hours and seems not to have any real goal other than keeping the audience enthralled through one shocking moment after another. In fact, this was my problem with Precious: everything in the film seems to be done for shock value - each plot development is more shocking than the previous. Yet, the overall plot has little substance in my opinion; Precious tries to tackle too many social issues at once and does not explore any of them with the depth needed to be a truly moving film.    This is a fast-paced movie that does not spend much energy on character development or depth beyond the superficial level needed to keep the plot going. We get a taste of why the characters are the way they are but not much more. We get no explanation as to why Precious' father raped her (as we never meet him in the movie) and we only get an unsatisfying explanation as to why her mother allowed the rape to occur. Even the final scenes at the social worker's office felt unfinished; I was waiting for more and all we get is Precious leaving with both of her kids. The dialouge did explain why Precious was allowed to be raped, but this (like many other concepts in the movie) should have been futher explored.     This movie left me feeling empty, but not in the emotionally-drained way that a good movie can make you feel. I just felt like, \\"so, that's it? What was all the hype about?\\" Personally, I think because the movie's subject matter was so taboo and the language was so raw the movie received alot of undeserved accolades.
0066620996|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading Good to Great, but found it somewhat frustrating because it was not as prescriptive as Collin's previous book, Built to Last. Collins says that the books are really in the wrong order. Good to Great really should be read before Built to Last. Good to Great describes what it takes to become an outstanding company. Built to Last provides more of the leadership principles that make it happen.<br /><br />The Clemmer Group has worked with a few management teams who have tried to use these books to move themselves from good to great. They used terms like \\"getting people on and off the bus\\" or \\"The Hedgehog Concept,\\" but weren't able to make things substantially better. Their implementation frustrations illustrate a much bigger \\"Strategy Gap\\" problem I see all the time.<br /><br />The first part of the problem is that far too many management teams confuse strategy with execution. They think that having the plan or understanding a concept is doing it. The second part of the problem is that a good management team can't build a great organization. The place to start improving the organization is by improving the dynamics and effectiveness of the management team itself, to make them great. But it's a very rare team that is willing to look in that mirror.
B002VECLVO|4.0|A gay film that is not that full of gaiety in spite of its gayness. A gay university professor - what a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu character - loses his 16 year long love affair with the accidental death of his lover to whose funeral he will explicitly not be invited. He cannot accept this solitude. So he delivers his last classes, cleans up his office and walks out with the intention of not coming back. On the university parking lot he is stopped by a young student who is obviously making a discreet pass to him. He does not encourage it. On the liquor store parking lot he crosses a gigolo who is making a pass to him too but he discourages it in the end. He visits his lifelong girlfriend of old and walks home to carry out his last living act. But he can't. So he goes to the bar next door to buy cigarettes and a bottle of alcohol. There he is captured by the young student and his innocent looking smile. They drink. On a challenge from the student they go swim in the Pacific Ocean. Back at the professor's place they drink some more. The professor passes away. He wakes up on his bed at 3 in the morning with the student sleeping on the sofa holding the gun. The professor takes the gun away burns his suicide notes and dreams of a new lapse of love and life. But when death has come death has to triumph and it always does, even if it were in the form of a breathing vegetable. The details of the death are in the film. All together that film is by far too light on a subject that is by far too heavy for such a light film. It could have been a masterpiece and it is only an emotional little entertainment.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
0060566108|5.0|This was my favorite leadership book of the nineties. I have referred to and quoted from this profound book many times since reading it in 1994 (cited in my books [[ASIN:1894933583 Pathways to Performance: A Guide to Transforming Yourself, Your Team, and Your Organization]] and [[ASIN:0968467512 The Leader's Digest: Timeless Principles for Team and Organization Success]]). Based on extensive research of 18 \\"visionary companies\\" and 18 corresponding \\"comparison companies,\\" the authors explore why visionary companies (all founded before 1950) still lead their industry and surpass their much less successful competitors. Collins and Porras give us deep insight into why \\"visionary companies prosper over long periods of time, through multiple product life cycles and multiple generations of active leaders.\\" Anyone interested in building a high performance culture must read this powerful book.
B000002NZO|4.0|When Genesis made their debut, 'From Genesis to Revelation' in 1969, it was clearly more Jonathan King, their producer's album, then theirs. The record featured mostly '60s Brit pop tunes heavily influenced by the early-day Bee Gees. They then left Decca Records and signed on ABC Records in 1970. By this time, the band was Peter Gabriel on vocals, Anthony Phillips on guitars, Mike Rutherford on bass guitar, Tony Banks on all keyboards, and John Mayhew on drums (no Phil Collins just yet -- he'd join in later in the year).    The new lineup (Mayhew replaced drummer Chris Stewart later in 1969) went into the studio and released 'Trespass' in October 1970. With this album, Genesis provided a clear indication of things to come -- goodbye, simple pop tunes, and hello progressive rock royalty. So, how does this album measure up nearly 40 years later?    Well, it's an outstanding album. Sure, the band would gain more confidence as they progressed, but they were still capable of writing some mighty-fine prog rock in 1970. 'White Mountain' is one of my all-time favorite songs; Tony's organ and Mayhew's drumming drive the song and make it one of the great early progressive tracks. This song was so popular, in fact, Genesis would frequently play it live in on their 1976 'A Trick of the Tail' tour with Phil Collins (who wasn't even in the band at this time) singing lead on it.     'Looking for Someone' could have easily been featured on their next album, 'Nursery Cryme.' Gabriel's mellow voice is accompanied by Tony's organ throughout most of the song. This is another clear indication of things to come for this legendary band.     I've always liked 'Visions of Angels.' Critics have ripped on it in the past for having \\"weak lyrics.\\" I hear nothing of the sort. I think it's a very good and quite interesting track, another Tony-dominated track. Anthony also plays very nice acoustic, classical style guitar. 'Visions' is a good song; sure, it's no 'Fountain of Salmacis,' but it's still a fine song that is definitely worth a listen.    'Stagnation' and 'Dusk' are also songs heavily driven by Anthony, and also Mike. Gabriel's voice is calm on these tracks, which are perfectly mellow. 'Stagnation' is also a song the band would sample in the future; Genesis would play a part of it -- albeit very briefly -- during their 1980 tour with their 'Cage' medley. 'Dusk' is probably the weakest song on the album; believe me, it's very good, but it's just not as great as the others. Although it is a nice acoustic-driven tune that I do appreciate very much.    And finally, to conclude the album, Genesis delivers their (well, at least up to that point) magnum opus. 'The Knife.' At 8:55, Genesis makes the most out of these nine minutes. It's by far the best song on the album; it's so complex, and the entire band dominates throughout. Mike's haunting bass line, Tony's incredible skill at the organ, Ant's virtuoso moves on the guitar, Pete's chilling vocals, and Mayhew's steady beat dominate this song throughout. Genesis would play this song live up until 1981 (although sporadically after Collins became lead singer). This song, musically, gave more hints as to where the band were going then other song on the album. What an incredible song. (Note: look for the great live version of this on their 1973 live album 'Genesis Live').     As you all probably know, after this record, guitarist and founding member Anthony Phillips departed, as did drummer John Mayhew. Mayhew was replaced by 20-year old drummer Phil Collins; Phillips was replaced by Steve Hackett, who would stay with the band until early-1978. The group got musically better with their next album, 'Nursery Cryme' and even better with the albums that followed.    But overall, if you are a Genesis fan, you need to own 'Trespass.' This is basically where it all began. This is where the band became the progressive band that dominated their sound for the next 12 years (before they \\"sold out,\\" but that's a different story). 'Trespass' is a must own record for any Genesis fan, and more importantly, for any progressive rock fan.     Highly recommended for any progressive rock or Genesis fan.     ENJOY!!!
B000002JSJ|5.0|This is Led Zeppelin doing what they know best: rock and roll and blues.   Forget all the experiments with folk, funk, reggae, prog, eastern music heard in their previous albuns, since Led Zeppelin III. Presence begins in the very moment Bring it on Home, of Led Zeppelin II, recorded seven years before, ended.  On Ptresence, we hear only three instruments (gutar, bass and drums) and a voice. No keyboards, no mandolins, no tabla drums. And what use they make of these instruments!   Presence, at that point of LZ career, was indeed a clever move towards their roots: an effort to avoid falling into the hollow grandiloquence that killed other bands in the mid 70's, like Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis. That's why Led Zeppelin is still so much missed and Presence is such an important and beautiful album.  Don't hesitate. Buy it and you won't regret.
B000YPUFA6|1.0|As a guy who plays the games I can say as a fan of Resident Evil that watching this movie is equivalent to being violated by a rusty chainsaw. Alice isn't so much a character as an eldritch abomination feeding on the competence of everyone from the games. What's worse Alice's powers don't make sense even in the often absurd rules of the games: for instance, the t-virus gives psychic powers-it bears repeating, psychic powers from a mind destroying virus, think about it.    All in all, this wasn't a Resident Evil film so much as rambling love letter to one Mary Sue.

044654146X|2.0|I spent $26.99 plus tax to buy this book hoping that I was buying some serious research. What a misleading mishmash of truth-obfuscating, undeserved cheer-leading!  The economic miracle of Israel starts to look like no miracle at all when one considers the cash that has been infused by the French first and in the billions by the USA since 1948 into that little sliver of a country (as the authors call it to convince the naive that we are dealing with supermen here we all should defer to). In fact, cold cash to the tune of five billion (yes, billion with a \\"b\\") every year leaves the pockets of the tortured American citizen who struggles to stay afloat under enormous direct and indirect tax burdens without health care (while Israel has a free health care system); all that cash, the American citizen's manipulated representatives send to Israel to fuel Israel's playing with white collar fun new stuff.   In fact, estimates have Israel's cost to the USA as high as 20 billion (yes, billion with a \\"b\\") every year.  And that's free money folks. They may call it loans at first but shortly thereafter, quietly, when no one is looking those billions of loans get transformed into grants by the magic wand of Congress. Pump that kind of free cash into any western country with 7 million souls, even a very corrupt one (and that flow of money has been going to Israel since 1948 (Israel's founding) when the population there was a lot less than 7 million) and you will see innovative sparks flying out of that country-guaranteed.   As the authors remark, it's OK if the young Israeli entrepreneur fails; that's even good! It looks great on his resume. All he has to do is keep on trying. And why not? There is more cash for him coming out of the place that just paid for his last failed attempt to try his god-gifted innovative talent.  Throughout the book, the USA is talked about as an inexplicably waning power while the Israel \\"phenomenon\\" in the area of technological innovation is held up inawe for its astonishing brilliance and vitality.  But the USA makes payments on its debts and Israel does not.  I suppose  we could mention the various cases of Israeli spies in the USA (they were not trying to steal hamburger recipes for sure) but the above are enough to point out the book's gaping omissions. Books like the \\"start-up nation\\" do great damage because they hold up a lie for all of us to envy and emulate; a lie because the real reason for \\"the miracle\\" they extol and sing with so much unstinting praise and admiration is very prosaic and if that reason is mentioned the miracle gets \\"de-miracled\\" in one line of text.   What we have in Israel is a performance athlete that wins top medals giving stunning performances. It is indeed inspiring; all until someone reveals the heavy steroid use involved.
B001HN694K|3.0|I've always liked Tim Burton's work for the most part. I've come to recognize over the years that his movies are either very,very good or they seem to be \\"by the book\\" & lack the imagination that some of his other films have. Sadly, this film is one of those that seem to have been typical \\"paint by numbers\\" Burton.<br /><br />This film is half sequel, half re-imagining of the Alice in Wonderland story. Alice has grown to womanhood & on the day of a garden party she discovers that she is going to receive a proposal from a pompous & humorless suitor she has no love for. Bolting from the scene of the proposal, Alice follows a white rabbit down a hole & finds herself in Underland- a land she's been to before. With the help of an assorted cast of characters including the Mad Hatter, Alice must defeat the Jabberwocky & restore the rightful queen of Underland to the throne.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie. However everyone I'd spoken to about it said the same thing. \\"The visuals are BEAUTIFUL but the story isn't all that great.\\" I have to agree with that. If Burton had spent as much time on the story as he did on the visuals, this would have been far better. When the film has Alice wandering around Underland or in the Red Queen's castle, the film is fantastic. Unfortunately those scenes only make up about a third or a half of the film, with the rest of the film feeling vaguely tedious. (My mother got up partway through the film, came back & felt like she barely missed a thing.) The story is barely there & I kind of wished that the film had been at least 15 minutes shorter. A friend of mine said that Burton is starting to become the \\"Michael Bay of special effects & gothy, candy colors\\". I almost gave him a black eye for saying Burton & Michael Bay in the same sentence, but after watching this I can't help but think that there's a little something to what he said.<br /><br />Acting-wise, the film is \\"ok\\". Helena Bonham & Crispin Glover are the two best parts of the film, to be honest. They go through their roles with sadistic glee & its at those moments that I really enjoyed the film the most. Then there's Johnny Depp. I love Johnny Depp, but quite frankly... this wasn't his best role. He was basically Jack Sparrow playing the Mad Hatter. He was fine enough for the most part, but I couldn't help but think that perhaps someone else would have done a better job. (I actually kind of thought that it would have been better if Glover & Depp had swapped roles, although that would have deprived me of watching Glover as the Knave of Hearts.)<br /><br />The film is ok. That's really the best I can say for it. The good thing about Tim Burton is that even when he's at his worst, he's still pretty darn entertaining. Now don't worry. This isn't nearly as bad as 'Planet of the Apes' or 'Cabin Boy' (yep, he made that stinker). Well, not until Johnny Depp does his dance. That was absolutely the stupidest thing I'd ever seen & I kept silently hoping that something- ANYTHING would cut his legs off so he would be incapable of torturing the audience with that awful dance of his. (Seriously, I'd rather 'The Hottie & The Nottie' than see that dance again.)<br /><br />Long story short: this film is more about visuals than story. If that's your cup of tea, you'll love this film. I can only hope that with Burton's next film- an adaptation of 'Dark Shadows', he brings back some of the Burton charm. This movie is just a pale shadow of what Burton can really do.st.

B001N26GFM|5.0|The innocent son of a high-ranking Nazi commandant, Bruno has been largely shielded from the harsh realities of the war. When Bruno discovers that his father has been promoted and that their family will be moving from Berlin into the countryside, he doesn't take the news well. Increasingly bored in his sprawling yet dreary country abode and forbidden by his mother from exploring the backyard, young Bruno searches for something to do while his older sister plays with dolls and vies for the attention of handsome Lieutenant Kotler. One day, bored and gazing out his bedroom window, Bruno spies what first appears to be a nearby farm and his parents refuse to discuss it, and all of the inhabitants there are curiously clad in striped pajamas.  Both young actors give enormously moving performances and the manner in which Herman directs the action underlines the blur of perception many German's had about the reality of the Final Solution. But for what I perceive as the reason this movie sustains the powerful message it does is the manner in which it ends. There are no attempts to 'sanitize' this movie: it simply ends with a lightning bolt jolt that is one of the most powerful statements in all of the many movies about the Holocaust. It is simply a brilliant masterpiece of a movie from every aspect.

B00000J7JO|4.0|Starting off with squalling guitars and Anthony Keidis letting loose a banshee wail, he soon launches into the first verse. Belting out \\"Romping and stomping 'cause I'm in my prime\\" with the band in full bore behind him, you can tell that, this time, they mean it. \\"Californiacation\\" was the sound of a band that was now mature but not mellowed.<br /><br />John Frusciante, who'd left the band for the \\"One Hot Minute\\" album, had cleaned up and returned to the fold, and his presence is immediately felt. RHCP are in lock-step with their punk-funk rock and roll heyday, and Frusciante is the guitar gasoline to their Flea and Chad Smith's bass and drum spark-plugs. \\"Around The World,\\" \\"Get On Top\\" and \\"I Like Dirt\\" pound like the band's best, while \\"Otherside,\\" \\"Emit Remmus\\" and the title track boast mature songwriting.<br /><br />The apex of the band's new growth comes at the end of the album. Comprised mostly of Frusciante's acoustic guitar and an unusually soulful vocal by Keidis, \\"Road Trippin'\\" is smooth and clean, a statement that not only applied to the music, but to the players themselves. Like \\"Knock Me Down,\\" \\"Under The Bridge\\" and Californication's \\"Scar Tissue,\\" \\"Road Trippin'\\" contemplates the RHCP past while making good on a future of creativity. I played this song over and over at the end of 1999, because it made me think that the path to the new century might be a bright one. For the Peppers, it was a way to say goodbye to a decade with one of their best albums.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Ok,  bought these based on CNET review.  Have to admit if you utilize the optical cable the sound is pretty phenomenal.  I already owned a pair of Radio Shack infrared wireless headphones.  They never sounded great, but got the job done when everyone else wanted to go to sleep and I couldn't watch my movie or play my game loudly.  I hooked this new set up yesterday,  and the sound quality (not to mention overall comfort) was 100% better than the infrared phones.  I will tell you that the range I expected with 2.4ghz wireless is not what I am getting.  The infrared phones have much better range, but don't sound anything near as well.  I do have the headphone base station sitting inside a cabinet in my entertainment center, because I didn't want to look at it.  I expect that if the base station were in the open it would have better range as well as less signal degradation.  I did notice however if someone walked in between the base station and the headphones you would get signal pop.  I would give them 5 stars if they weren't so expensive.

B002T921DE|5.0|George Michael fans have been waiting for this video for a long time, just as they did the tour it documents.  It was worth the wait.  Since I was lucky enough to see George in Seattle on this tour, the standard I had when watching this video was how well it recreated the feeling of seeing him in concert.  Of course, watching a concert video in your home will never be the same as being there for the real thing, but whereas a lot of videos don't even come close to approximating the real-life concert experience, this one really does remind me of what it felt like to be there in the arena.  I attribute this in large part to the excellent surround mixes.  Both Dolby 5.1 and DTS-HD mixes sound fantastic, and are very close to what I remember the in-house mix sounding like at the concert.  George is in great voice, and he is balanced well with the rest of the band.  I don't know why some reviewers are complaining of distortion or other sound issues; I didn't hear any, and I had the volume CRANKED.  I also agree with other reviewers that the mixes are no more bass-heavy than the music at the concert itself.  The HD video quality is outstanding on Blu-ray, beautifully capturing the innovative lighting and staging of the dynamic production, which is even more advanced than that seen in the North American shows, adding a runway, laser effects, and special audience lighting.  The sold-out house is a full-on disco party, with a huge - and hugely enthusiastic - audience, and we're right in the middle of it.  I defy any George Michael fan not to get goosebumps and/or feel an urge to dance or clap or sing at least a few times while watching this.<br /><br />If I have one point to quibble about with this release, it's the omission of two key numbers from \\"The Final Two\\" concerts filmed for this disc. George performed \\"Star People\\" and \\"Hard Day\\" at the first of the two Earl's Court shows.  It would have been nice if those songs had been included here either as part of the main program, or at least as bonus tracks, especially since they were featured in many of his concerts on the tour and are favorites of a lot of fans.  Having said that, we do get a fantastic two-hour program, as complete as any other concert George performed on this tour.  With three bonus tracks added for good measure, there's more material on this disc than any audience got to see at a single concert.  We also get the \\"documentary,\\" which is more of a lightweight, fly-on-the-wall look at what was going on behind the scenes, but it still is fun to see.  On the whole, this is an outstanding memento of a tour that has rewarded many of George's loyal and longstanding fans.  Those fans need not hesitate to pick this up.
0345495004|2.0|LOVING FRANK<br /><br />This book was the pick for book club; otherwise, I would have never finished it.  I am glad I did finish it though and found out everything that happened in this tragic love affair.<br /><br />I have seen TV shows and heard about Frank Lloyd Wright and the beautiful homes he created with his gift for architecture.  What I didn't know was about the man himself and how he affected so many lives - not necessarily in a good way.<br /><br />This is the story of his affair with Mamah Borthwick Cheney.  He is hired to create a home for her and her husband; long story short, the two end up in love and having an affair.  Cheney leaves her husband, along with her children, to be with Wright.  Wright is also married with children.<br /><br />The book is good in the fact that it tells the story of the Wright/Cheney affair in detail.  How the two left their spouses, children, lives to create a new one.  Back in the early 1900's women hardly had any rights -- it surprised me that women didn't even have the rights to their own children.  Cheney's husband kept their two children when she went off with Wright.<br /><br />While full of history and the facts of lives about Wright and Cheney, I found myself plodding through this book, not caring much about any of the characters.  Frank Lloyd Wright was portrayed -- and quite rightly so -- as a very selfish man, seeming to care only about his work and himself.  While he seemed to love Cheney, she gave up everything to be with him and I found myself wondering if he ever really appreciated the fact that she gave up so much for him.<br /><br />I generally enjoy fictional history, finding it an appealing way to find out about the past and the lives of the people involved.  However, this book was a bit too tedious with cardboard characters that I found I didn't really enjoy knowing.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam
0061876747|5.0|I had never read William Boyd before, but this tense, intriguing account will bring me back for more. This novel more than satisfies on two levels. First, what happens to Adam Kindred, caught up in mysteries beyond his understanding? Second, its account of the all-knowing modern state -- almost all-knowing, anyhow. I highly recommend Ordinary Thunderstorms.
B000006TRV|4.0|The product itself was great. We love the music from The Wall, Pink Floyd. The CD case was broken when we got it and we had to replace it. Would like to see better packing for such things.
B0027LZ4CE|4.0|This box collects all live recordings made over the past decade in the magnificent Dom.  The performances are quite good, although there is a huge amount of reverberation owing to the size of the venue.  This at times contributes to the enjoyment, but more often than not detracts from the clarity of musical lines.    The performances are interesting it that the strings are very noticeable, unlike with many Bruckner recordings where the brass and horns tend to dominate.    For #20 plus shipping this is an excellent way to hear all the wonderful symphonies.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Here is the formula to writing a Dan Brown Novel. First one must pick a group of a million or more to offend, here are some examples: the Catholic Church, the Freemasons or heck why not just go for all Christians, good PR. Second you've got to make the whole book span about twelve hours then add an amazing revelation destroying previous beliefs. Don't forget to add a devious villian who is not who everyone thinks  he is.Then you add about 400 pages of useless or false information and about ten pages of useful facts. Finally you add an anticlimax at the end and you have your Dan Brown novel.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|I had my misgivings ever since I heard Troy Duffy was planning a sequel to his 1999 sleeper hit The Boondock Saints, but I was wrong...<br /><br /> This is a movie for all those Boondock Saints fans out there and it does not disappoint!<br /><br />We follow the MacManus Brothers ten years later hiding in Ireland, when they are drawn back into the game when they are supposedly connected to a hit on a priest back in Boston. So the Brothers return to Boston to exact revenge on who is framing them with the help of Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr--- who provides most of the comedy). And Stepping in the shoes of FBI Agent Smecker (Willem Defoe) is his protege Eunice Bloom whom she learned everything from her mentor (played by Julie Benz who is sexy, and smart in fact very smart, that she makes smart people feel like retards) And have to mention she looks very good in one sequence in a sort of cowboy outfit, complete with cowboy hat and all... very provocative. Expect some returning characters from the original... the 3 cops, the gun runner/seller, the bar keeper with turrets, their fatheer Il Duce (Billy Connolly) and a fan favorite.. Rocko \\"I killed your cat you druggie b***!\\" Still my favorite line from The Boondock Saints<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />This was a fun movie, nice gun play, comedy, kick ass soundtrack, Troy Duffy does not disappoint the fans, he has delivered in Spades, and the ending is very cool, a special cameo by someone that you would not expect! And the ending hints toward, of course wait for it... Boondock Saints III Pray to the Rosary (that's what I would title it haha)<br /><br />One can tell Duffy had a slightly bigger budget than he did with the original, cool visuals, good shootouts, the interaction between Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery didn't lose a beat after a 10 year hiatus, showing camaraderie as the brothers Macmanus with the joking, cussing and in fighting one can expect from brotherly love, its shows through their performances as our favorite pair of anti heroes.<br /><br />Better than I have expected, good old fashion entertainment undeniably worth checking out if you are a Boondock Saints fan!Better than I have expected, good old fashion entertainment undeniably worth checking out if you are a Boondock Saints fan!
0743201140|5.0|I ordered this book for an educational management class. I was so concerned that the code in the back cover would be valid because my professor said that it was so important. I got the book. The code was intact and this book has proven to be a valuable tool. Not only do I use it for class assignments, but I find myself referring to it for areas outside of class. The strength finder assessment's revelation of my strengths was so accurate that it was almost scary. Great book!!!!
B002NWRMVS|2.0|I am no fan of the \\"loudness war\\" crap, but by far this is the worst victim. If it is a heavy rock band, it diminishes the sound quality, but nowhere near as much as it does here.  I first downloaded MP3 version and thought it was just the MP3 so I then got the CD.  And it was just as bad. Then I went out and spent $20 on the vinyl version because I had read you can't master things that \\"hot\\" on vinyl.  Well it sounds like they tried because it sounds much worse than the CD.  I couldn't even finish the first song.  I love these songs and hopefully she will record them live and release them...and hopefully they will sound better.  But I can't listen to this record as it is.  I love her new direction in songwriting, but not the production.

B002YCVX5S|3.0|Inglorious Bastards does a lot right. The scene work, character, and dialog are all top notch. The main problem is that there are at least 3 distinct stories being told, all loosely tied together that don't come together in any meaningful way.
B001HN69B8|5.0|Coming to see this with low expectations - while I admire his inventiveness, I have never been much of a Terry Gilliam fan myself, and the word from the critics was not that good - I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. This entertaining and very imaginative fantasy starts with a traveling sideshow driving in a horse-drawn wagon through the seedier parts of a contemporary (if not very realistic) London. Heading the show is a very old wizard/psychic named Dr. Parnassus (veteran Christopher Plummer in a great performance) who promises the few members of the audience interested in them that if they cross a magic mirror, they will travel to a parallel world where their deepest fantasies rule (the \\"imaginarium\\" of the title), and where they will have to make a fateful choice about whether they want to follow good or evil. The show has little success (their forays into the magic portal tends to end badly for the audience), but in time the somewhat pathetic troupe (who also includes the beautiful teenage daughter of the wizard, a midget who is the sidekick of Dr. Parnassus, and a young assistant who is madly in love with the daughter) will see a change of fortune when they find and rescue a man hanging in a London bridge (Heath Ledger in his final performance before his untimely death). The man joins the troupe and claims to be an amnesiac, but eventually it will be found that he is a crook running from Russian gangsters from whom he took money. With time, we will also learn more of the back story of Dr. Parnassus: he was a monk who made a deal with the devil (impersonated wittily by Tom Waits) centuries ago: he gets to be immortal, but in exchange, he was to give her daughter to the devil when she turns 16. So you get the idea of the sort of convoluted plot here, but let me assure you that when you see it, you will find it very entertaining and less confusing than it sounds. An intelligent and unusual film, full of intriguing ideas, and helped by the fine performances, including that of Ledger: he died before shooting ended, so in his forays into the imaginary portal he is replaced by three different actors: Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I found Cohen and friends' performances well done.  The band's presentation seemed a little sedate for my liking, as the original songs often had greater shifts in dynamics.  However, these performances stayed more or less mellow, with a jazzy feeling of understated rhythm and smooth interludes from the gifted backing musicians (the twins' incredible duet deserves special mention).  Cohen's voice lacked the grit that made his recorded voice so compelling, but he made up for his deadpan delivery with playful philosophizing between songs and a sincere delivery that underscored the profundity of his beautiful songs about love, sexuality, heartbreak, transcendence, and death.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who might appreciate an intimate reflection on life's limitations and freedoms, or even just a quiet evening of good music.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This movie is now in my top 5 all time favorite movies!  I am a HUGE fan to Q.T.'s work and this one lived up to my expectations.  It is not for the faint of heart though because it has a lot of \\"killin' nazis\\" in it.  I have a twisted mind, but can understand why some just didn't like the movie.  Wish that Novak would have had a bigger part because that dude is hilarious!  My favorite line in the movie is from Aldo (Brad Pitt) where he says \\"Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin' in a basement offers a lot of difficulties. Number one being, you're fightin' in a basement!\\"  Also, love the fact that Tarantino changed up the name of the movie from the original (mis-spelling bastards).  Genius I tall ya!
0385512058|3.0|I found much helpful information in this book, but discrimination is needed to filter the good from the bad.<br /><br />I agree with the author's underlying premise that relationships are of vital importance to success in most arenas. People are indeed valuable!<br /><br />For me the most interesting and helpful parts of the book were those which addressed the courage and mind-set required to reach out to new people, as well as the practical \\"skill\\" elements of building new relationships. There are basic things that can be done to initiate and intentionally build relationships with those we meet, and to show people that they matter to us. This is important to hear especially for those who are introverts by nature. Ferrazzi shares many inspiring stories of his own attempts to grow his personal network. He also shares advice that he has actually tried, not just theories and statistical data. Much of his advice rings true in my own experience of cultivating relationships, and very helpful.<br /><br />I agreed with probably 85% of the advice that he gave, and found it very much worth reading. However, there were some things about the book that I didn't like. The author's tone came across overconfident and at times self-aggrandizing. But I do respect the fact that the author at least recognizes his tendency toward this kind of attitude and behavior. For instance, he shares the story of his early blunders with unchecked ambition as an aggressive young business professional. (A supervisor told him that his extreme desire to be successful was driving everyone around him crazy.) Yet, it seems that he hasn't quite overcome this impediment, based on the tone of his writing. But some of this may just boil down to personality and temperament, so I don't mean to speak too harshly here.<br /><br />Also, talk of \\"networking\\" generally carries with it a self-serving tendency. Unfortunately, I find this book to be no exception on this point.<br /><br />All in all, there is much practical and helpful information in this book and it's well worth reading, but I would caution readers to apply this book's instructions with discretion, and above all with an attitude of service rather than self-promotion.book and it's well worth reading, but I would caution readers to apply this book's instructions with discretion, and above all with an attitude of service rather than self-promotion.

B000K4X5XA|4.0|Today, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  And the first of my 22 Blu-Ray discs that I already bought that I played today was this movie of \\"Superman: The Movie.\\"<br /><br />Well, I just watched this Blu-Ray version of \\"Superman: The Movie\\", and then watched my old DVD of this film.  I'll have to say that buying the Blu-Ray disc of this movie proved to be a waste of money.  The Blu-Ray disc looks no better than the DVD.  In fact, I'll even say that the DVD had it's colors more in check than this Blu-Ray disc did.  On Blu-Ray, the flesh tones were rather too pink where on regular DVD, everyone's flesh tones looked more natural.  So, for this being my first Blu-Ray disc to watch and compare, I'm rather disappointed, but then again, greatly relieved.  Perhaps I won't bother buying Blu-Ray disc replacements for the DVD's that I already have and believe look quite good as the standard DVD's that they are.  I really do think that Blu-Ray is getting far more hype than they're really worth.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Amazing music, amazing lyrics, an amazing voice ...  I had no idea songs and music such as this were part of today's \\"popular\\" music.  The lyrics flow easily, but they are deep, and as demanding -- and rewarding -- as any poetry (which they are, of course, as are the lyrics of any song).  The accompaniment, vocal and instrumental, is outstanding.  All in all, a mind-opening discovery for me.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is eye opening and revealing to anyone who wants to know from where their food comes.  I do. Many do not. Most of my family does not.  I understand.  But like Oprah says, \\"When you know better, you do better.\\"  This is why many do not want to know.  But that attitude is what is killing us and our children.  Although, you may not want to know for your own person, what about our kids?  What are you teaching your own child?  Nothing is as important as what we put in our bodies for nourishment.  So, what is your excuse now?
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Not much to add to the high praise already left by so many fans regarding this remastered Star Trek series DVD set. Suffice to say, it is a pleasure to both the eyes & ears to have this marvelous 60's TV classic revitalized in such a manner that even Gene Roddenberry would have embraced it. I fully expect that this is the way he would have produced it had the technology existed at the time. And clearly, the remastering was performed with loving care by true fans of the original series. Bravo !!

B002ZG97RE|5.0|\\"Green Zone\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: During the U.S.-led occupation of Baghdad in 2003, Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller and his team of Army inspectors were dispatched to find weapons of mass destruction believed to be stockpiled in the Iraqi desert. Rocketing from one bobby-trapped and treacherous site to the next, the men search for deadly chemical agents but stumble instead upon an elaborate cover-up that inverts the purpose of their mission. Spun by operatives with intersection agendas, Miller must hunt through covert and faulty intelligence hidden on foreign soil for answers that will either clear a rogue regime or escalate a war in an unstable region. And at this blistering time and in this combustible place, he will find the most elusive weapon of all is the truth.    The cast led by Matt Damon (as Roy Miller) is excellent!

This is an excellent action-war-thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and your mind thinking at the same time. This is another hit for Matt Damon & Paul Greengrass. This is different than most war movies out there right now.
0307463745|5.0|I have used Basecamp since Feb 2008 to manage my own work as well contractors across the US and abroad.  One of the best features is the API, which allows for limitless possibilities (including iPhone access).  I have also built and launched a Rails web app, what an experience (not for a full-time programmer but for an attorney, if that doesn't demonstrate ease of use!).    I received REWORK yesterday and brought it along to a lecture-recital on the great cellist and humanitarian Pau (Pablo) Casals.  Casals made \\"a dent in the universe\\" (p.31) by revolutionizing cello playing, largely by adhering to the same natural principles outlined in REWORK: \\"Worst of all, the bowing arm was restricted. `We were taught to play a with a stiff arm and obliged to keep a book under the armpit,' said Casals, the man who changed all that\\".    REWORK provides a \\"checklist\\" of mostly unhealthy conventions that can be overcome by awareness and common sense.      One of my favorites is, for small teams: \\"Delagators are Dead Weight\\" or \\"Everybody Works\\" (p.218).  Another is \\"Draw a Line in the Sand\\" (p.43).  Indeed, we can all \\"do\\" and stand for something, which are two basic elements of authentic leadership.    REWORK will help me communicate better the concrete changes that Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson have made in my life (and I've never even met them).

0143038419|5.0|Eat Pray Love is one of those semi-biographies about hard-done by individuals finding meaning and healing by doing whatever it is the book is about.<br /><br />If that sounds cynical, this novel is actually pretty good. Perhaps what I enjoyed the most was insight into each of the different countries that Gilbert visited (which I realise wasn't necessarily the main intent of the book but whatever).<br /><br />The book isn't too long and not paticularly melodramtic or grandiose, the 'Pray' section meandered for me, but I found Gilbert's insights genuinely interesting towards the end of the section.<br /><br />Definately worth a read, it won't take much out of your day.
B00319KS7C|1.0|I watched this movie elsewhere but I thought you needed to know how horrible it was.  If I could've given it 0 stars I would've. First off, if you like corn and corn related products, then I say go right ahead and watch it if you can bear it.  But, if you are not crazy about the yellow cobs and corn refineries then take my advice and look at something else.  The previews looked funny but after watching less than half of this movie, I wanted to rip my hair out(that would have been more entertaining!)  My family and I couldn't watch anymore of the movie so we put in 2012 instead.    Overall, I give this two thumbs down.  Very disappointing!!!

B0030Y11XS|1.0|Once again Michael Moore delves into the world of halve truths to make a point. Forget about whether or not you agree with him; how can you condone his methods. Anyone who studies economic thought, honestly, knows that capitalist are not thieves; but thieves use capitalism just like they use socialism. True capitalist are those who find something people want and provide it for them at a price people are willing to pay. In this since Michael Moore is a capitalist, though his methods are dishonest; so that really makes him a thief. Moore's films are a diversion into his USSR Socialist thought and not worth the time to watch (that would be a capitalistic thought.
B002NT3B52|2.0|The book is not entertaining and is not particularly informative because of the sophisticated terminology being used. I have kept and loved cocker spaniels since I was a kid and they are much more human than the author thinks they are.     Dogs are faithful, adorable critters and are a barrel of laughs. And they know a lot more about us than we might think they do.     If you want to learn about a dog then get one and love it like a child. You will never regret it. The hardest part is losing one because they beat having a kid hands down. They are always there for you and are so dependent on you, which makes them all the more precious.    I will agree with one thing, just get a mutt as they are sturdier and more flexible to the rigors of humanity than a purebred is.  Some of the crosses make nice pets too.  Go to a pound and get a healthy one or two that needs a home.  You will be glad you did.

B000002J6H|5.0|Stephen Stills' 1970 solo album has way more depth than what radio plays from it. Radio stations are stuck on the first track, LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH, which is a great song, but there are so many more great songs here. Fresh off of Buffalo Springfield, as well as being at the start of a very successful tenure in Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, Stephen Stills took time to put together one of the finest collections of songs in the history of music. This album has it all:Powerful ballads, gospel, folk, rock, blues, jazz, etc. Even the late great Jimi Hendrix appears on a track (Old Times, Good Times). I particularly like TO A FLAME, which is so unusual-sounding. This album is just plain powerful, and the melodies are bold and addictive. I recommend this album to anyone who just wants to hear some good music, regardless of their age. This album can appeal to anyone. 10/10

B001E75QH0|4.0|With an almost $2 Billion(!)worldwide gross so far(theatrical take only,this doesn't include DVDs and related merchandise),the Indiana Jones movie franchise has certainly been one of the most successful of its kind in movie history.Certainly with its throwback to the old movie serial story arcs,the plots and action have continued to hold up extremely well.Now with the release of this five DVD set,they are now bundled into one package for your convenience;\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"(June,1981),\\"I.J.and the Temple of Doom\\"(May,1984),\\"I.J.and the Last Crusade\\"(May,1989) and\\"I.J. and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\"(May 2008).<br />\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" concerns the story of and search for the Ark of the Covenant.Set in 1936 the movie opens with Dr.Jones(Ford)in the Peruvian jungle trying to obtain a golden idol head.Through some remarkably tense moments he does so but barely escapes with his life.Just as he thinks he is home free a Frenchman and rival by the name of Belloq(Paul Freeman)confiscates the head.Jones flees for his life and just makes it out.Back home he is approached by Government agents who put him onto a search for the fabled Ark of the Covenant.His first stop is Nepal and his old friend Dr.Ravenwood who has an important artifact and clue.But he has passed away and his daughter Marion(Karen Allen),with whom he has had \\"contact\\" before,has possession of the artifact.Before Indy can obtain it Nazis show up also looking for it.Marion and Indy flee to Cairo where they meet up with old friend Sallah(John Rhys Davies)who helps Indy with men,materiel and and his vast local knowledge.After more harrowing times Indy finds the location of the Ark and they just manage to escape with it to England aboard ship;from under the nose of his rival Belloq(who is working with the Germans).But they are intercepted and taken to an island in the Mediterranean to test the Ark.It is opened and a tied up Indy and Marian look away as the Ark's powers destroy the Nazi's.<br />\\"I.J.and the Temple of Doom\\" is set in 1935 and opens with Indy trying to get himself out of the clutches of a Chinese gang in a nightclub in Shanghai.With another hot and fast opening like the previous film,Indy barely manages his escape,but does so with the help of young friend called Short Round(Ke Huy Quan-better known from \\"Goonies\\") and accompanied reluctantly by club singer Willie Scott(Kate Capshaw).They flee in an airplane which is unfortunately owned by the self same crime boss he just escaped from.Over the Himalayas the pilots jump out leaving Indy and company to their own devices.They escape near death with the help of a self-inflating raft pushed out the plane and down into a river.They end up in a village which has come upon vary hard times.According to the leader it is because their sacred Sivalinga stone has been taken to the Pankot Palace,where an ancient cult has again arisen to enslave the land and its' peoples,especially the children.Indy goes to the palace and and at first all appears normal until he stumbles onto the truth and finds that a cult is indeed trying to rise up through possession of a number of Savalinga stones.Through more harrowing and life threatening moments Indy retrieves the villages' stone and returns it along with its' previously enslaved children.<br />\\"I.J.and the Last Crusade\\" starts out with a young Indy in 1912 out with a boy scout troop on horse back.He stumbles upon a group of men who have unearthed the Cross of Coronado and which Indy believes belongs in a museum.He steals it from the men and through a very long chase on horseback,on a train and finally on foot he makes it back home;only to have the local Sheriff take it from him and give it to the \\"rightful\\" owner.Fast forward to 1938 and he is on board a freighter and the self same \\"rightful\\"owner is taking back that self same cross from Indy once again.This time Indy escapes with the cross and the owner and ship both go down together.After being back home a Mr Donovan(Julian Glover) approaches Indy with a proposition to find the Holy Grail,telling him a party of men he has hired has gone missing including its' guide;the guide being Indy's father.With the help of his fathers' diary which he received recently in the mail,he goes first to Venice and meets a rep of Donovan's;a Dr Schneider.She accompanies him during which time he uncovers a tomb of one of the knights of the Crusades and a clue to the starting point of his search.After  many tense moments with a group dedicated to keeping the Holy Grail a secret,Jones leaves for Salzburg to rescue his father Dr Jones Sr(Sean Connery).From here both Jones's end up in Turkey and in a cave filled with booby traps.The Nazi's(again,and with Dr.Schneider being one of them)force Indy to go through three deadly traps and into the grail room.It is guarded by one of the original knights who tells him to choose wisely.Donovan is there and chooses unwisely but the cup is not fated to leave the cave and all the good guys barely escape with their lives.The film ends with all riding into a glorious sunset.<br />\\"I.J.the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" finds us in 1957 with a fast moving convoy of Army trucks.They come upon a fenced off restricted area and shoot the guards there.We soon find out they are Commies and Indy and a former friend McHale(Ray Winstone)have been kidnapped.They are in Nevada at an Area 51 warehouse and the Soviets,led by Spalko(Cate Blanchett),want Jones to retrieve a case containing an alien body that Jones himself and others unearthed 10 years before in Roswell(Jones was unaware of the contents until then).After escaping the warehouse Indy stumbles into a peaceful\\"town\\" only to find it is a phony,one that is in range of a nuclear bomb which is ready to detonate.Indy survives by hiding in a refrigerator and getting blasted into the desert.After decontamination Indy is grilled by the FBI who thinks he's working wuith the Commies.When the FBI later show up at the college where he works the college decides to let him go,not wanting the adverse publicity.Aboard his train leaving Indy is approached by a Mutt Williams(Shia LaBeouf)who says his old professor and friend Dr Oxley(John Hurt) and his mother have been kidnapped in Peru.Off they go and they find Oxley had been in a mental facility there but had since left.However he left behind clues to his whereabouts.They discover a temple with a crystal skull(in the shape of an alien head) and shortly after are captured by the Soviets.In their camp on the Amazon they find Dr Oxley and Mutt's mother Marion Ravenswood(Karen Allen),who tells Indy Mutt is his son(!).After a harrowingly pitched battle run through the jungle,Indy and the gang escape the Commies and find the fabled Akator city where the skull originally came from and a room ringed with skeletal crystal aliens.It seems these are inter dimensional beings and when the crystal head is replaced onto its' proper body it transforms from several into one alien, which comes alive.Spalko takes the knowledge she seeks from the Alien with her to her grave while the rest of the gang barely make it out alive.Indy and party watch as a giant flying saucer rises from beneath the temple rubble and vanishes.The film ends with Indy and Marion finally marrying.<br />The last film puts a wonderful\\"cap\\" on the entire series as it comes full circle with Marion and Indy marrying.The ending also leaves us with a possible opening for a future Indiana Jones movie,but if this turns out to be the last with Harrison Ford,it couldn't go out in any better fashion.Ford climbs into his Indy character here without so much as a hiccup and its shows how he has made the part very much his own.<br />I think the weakest of the lot here is \\"Doom\\",with the first one being the best and the others just a tad below that.I used to think \\"Crusade\\" was the weakest but I have gained a new appreciation for the film I originally hadn't had in its' first run.<br />All the DVDs come with their own multiple special features including trailers,featurettes,new intros by Spielberg and Lucas,photo galleries and more.The only difference in them is that the \\"Crystal Skull\\" comes with an extra disc for its special features.The films have all been transferred wonderfully and there are no complaints here at all in picture or sound.All are presented in their original aspect ratio widescreen format and are beautiful to behold.Each disc comes in their own individual slim case.<br />If you wanted the entire series of Indiana Jones features,these are the ones to get.Each movie has its' patented boffo opening designed to pull you into the film as soon as possible and heart pounding finish,and generally all succeed famously.In between the two are some of the most memorable moments of adventure ever filmed.It's a throwback to the serials of the 30s and 40s for sure but with a more modern sensibility and better special effects.Ford is solid from his first appearance to his last and they couldn't have picked a better man for the job.Get your set of adventures right now!ege decides to let him go,not wanting the adverse publicity.Aboard his train leaving Indy is approached by a Mutt

B002ZG97RE|1.0|Here we go again .. yet another example of Hollywood in all it's ignorance of real world intelligence and history making a movie that is nothing more than a thinly veiled propoganda tool.<br /><br />It seems guys like Damon, Clooney and others have confused their ability to act and make believe in the world of film making with the complexities of the real world.<br /><br />An otherwise potentially good film plot was ruined by this movie's overbearing preaching, conspiracy theory perpetuation and excessive left leaning political slant.<br /><br />It is always better when film makers lift themselves ABOVE mundane daily politics and have their movies portray Universal Values and messages.<br /><br />Instead, this film gets sucked into the muck and mire of the daily politics we see in the world of FOX NEWS -vs-  CNN NEWS.  As a result it gets warped into nothing more than an excuse for some film makers in Hollywood to vent their political views and stand on a soapbox for 100 minutes trying to sway public sentiment to their way of thinking.<br /><br />Pretty forgettable.  This film will probably make less than $40 million and dissapear from people's minds in less than 30 days.
0199267170|5.0|When searching for a complete edition of Shakespeare, it is easy to go wrong with a bad one.  I went through two others before I found this one.  I trust this edition to represent the best of up to date research, and it is the basis for any study I do.<br /><br />Certainly one would need to supplement this work with other books of interpretation.  I actually prefer it this way, as I find it unwieldy and distracting to have commentary taking up the pages of the actual edition I'm reading.<br /><br />I find no fault with the binding of my copy.

B001HN697M|4.0|\\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is a prequal to the excellent [[ASIN:B0000VAFO0 Underworld (Widescreen Special Edition)]].<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; this follows the story line show in \\"Underworld\\" where the werewolf slave Lucian (Michael Sheen) has a forbidden relationship with the vampire coven leader's (Viktor, again played by Bill Nighy) daughter, Sonja (Rhona Mitra). There are a few interesting subplots, including how Lucian becomes the leader of the lycans and the origin of one of the more memorable werewolves from the first movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, making the mood of the movie very \\"Gothic\\" and is very much reminiscent of \\"Underworld\\". The action is much more intense and the special effects are even better this time.<br /><br />Once again, some liberties were taken with the vampire and werewolf mythologies but nothing too far out of bounds. Like the first movie, my only real complaint is that the average vampire is portrayed as far too weak compared to the werewolves.<br /><br />Fans of the original movie, like me, will likely enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B002QGUFWE|1.0|the \\"lady gaga\\" persona is actually a very clever business decision. she's the perfect fabricated idol for all these wannabe fashionistas who see themselves as \\"club-goers,\\" and fashion that into an identity because they're desperately bored with themselves and want to think they're living the \\"movie\\" of their lives between facebook updates about blacking out; \\"ironic,\\" probably pierced/tattooed 20-somethings who crave peer validation almost as much as they pretend not to, and who are easily impressed by accessorized quirks because they were fed on a steady diet of superficiality their entire lives and mistake noise and sensation for substance. soulless, boring music for people who match.
B001NFNFF8|4.0|There seems to be a lot of disappointment expressed about this film which I find baffling - because even as a complete novice to James Lee Burke's books or the director's past works - I loved it. I really did. I found \\"In The Electric Mist\\" to be a very compelling story - powerful acted and cleverly told. And something of undiscovered gem.<br /><br />Once again Tommy Lee Jones as the haggard and troubled lead - just stuns - his depth and power fill the screen absolutely all of the time. Credit must also go to the uniformly superb supporting cast too (even if in some cases they don't get a lot to do) - John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard, Mary Steenburgen, Ned Beatty, Kelly MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor-Vince, Justina Machado and even Buddy Guy (the blues guitar player) - all good. And then there's Levon Helm of the famous Americana rock group THE BAND as the ghost of a Confederate General - adding extraordinary old-world gravitas and mystery to the piece.<br /><br />The Blu Ray print is BEAUTIFUL too - even in the dark interiors - but especially in the outdoor swamp shots and town houses. Disappointingly though, there are precious few extras.<br /><br />Bertrand Tavernier's film isn't a masterpiece for sure, and it's perhaps just a little 'too' in love with its own gumbo and Louisiana scenery, but I found it immensely moving in places - and awkwardly real - especially on the core subject of racism and its still lingering malevolent presence (the title of this review is a rumination by one of the characters on that subject when a dead body from 1965 comes back to haunt him).<br /><br />The film reminded me of John Sayles at his best (\\"Passion Fish\\" for instance) - full of heart and great observation - which is high praise indeed...<br /><br />I'd say ignore the so-so reviews and put it high on your rental list. Recommended.
1423119509|4.0|Wanted to read books before I saw the first movie.  Easy quick read with greek mythology.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly. One of the better movies I've seen in the last few years. It has been described as \\"Superbad meets Shaun of the Dead\\" and while I wouldn't specifically say that is inaccurate, I wouldn't personally describe it as such. It has similar elements from both, but it has a lot more too.<br /><br />It's very funny, and very fun to watch. The actors did a very nice job, especially the young Abigail Breslin. This is perhaps Woody Harrelson's finest performance as well. The zombies were well done and the special effects were good. I would recommend this to any zombie lover, or anyone who likes a good comedy.
B00004VVND|4.0|The primary image I have of Yul Brynner is distilled from four films: THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE KING AND I, ANASTASIA, and this one, WESTWORLD. And for someone who barely gets any dialogue in this sci-fi western, Brynner wields the most impact, carries the strongest presence. Even though Richard Benjamin and James Brolin co-star, it's Yul Brynner's character people remember best when thinking of WESTWORLD.<br /><br />Michael Crichton writes the story and directs the thing, and this is his debut at directing things. It's an intriguing concept that he introduces, and one that he'll revisit many years later in the blockbuster JURASSIC PARK. In the story Westworld is only one of the three fully interactive, fully immersive adult recreational theme resorts run by the Delos corporation, the other two being Roman World and Medieval World. Fantasies are fulfilled here, and nightly bacchanals in which to revel. Role playing is taken to the extremes. You can do whatever you want here, seemingly without repercussions. Two friends visit Westworld, thinking this, not knowing just how wrong they are.<br /><br />In Westworld, which apes the rugged frontier towns of the 1880s, the greenhorn guest engages in gunfights and saloon brawls, and sleeps with the local soiled dove. No doubt all these activities are described in the brochure, and no one even looks at you sideways when you engineer a jailbreak for your incarcerated pal. Westworld's inhabitants are robots who impeccably simulate humans, automatons \\"scientifically programmed to look, act, talk, and even bleed just like humans do.\\" And so they're shot down or beat up or bedded with impunity. The two friends, Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blane (James Brolin), take on a stalker, this pushy gunslinger (Brynner) with dead metal eyes who time and again, as per script, goes down in a hail of bullets. Until he doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the fun is in seeing what goes on behind the curtain. The film frequently shifts the scenery to the lab techs running the show, fixing and rebooting the machines on a nightly basis, and we note their cluelessness and inability to adapt when things begin to go haywire, when the machines begin to rebel and murder their guests. And, let me tell you, for a thousand dollars a day, I expect better than a sword punched thru the gut. \\"Nothing can go wrong,\\" the reassuring disembodied voice says twice during orientation. You think the techs would have a solid emergency contingency plan in place. Happily, they don't, and that's why this movie is fun. It's always fun when there's a glitch in the product, a gremlin in the system.<br /><br />WESTWORLD came out in 1973, so the special effects pale in comparison to what we've got today. There's also this weird lack of energy at times on the screen, and I guess you have to put this at Crichton's feet since he was in the director's chair. Part of that low energy level has to do with the protagonist's tepid sense of self-preservation. In his encounters with the implacable Brimstone Kid he sometimes settles for strolling away instead of urgently running the f--- out of there. Also, with the technological advances proposed in this film, it's really unbelievable that they're still having issues with perfecting the robot hands to pass for human hands. And how the Brimstone Kid can see with its cruddily pixelated robot-vision, I don't know, although, okay, the robot is equipped with a full sensory array. I'm basically grousing because the robotic perspective looks cheesy.<br /><br />But disregard all that. I think they're minor drawbacks, really. WESTWORLD, with its 88 minute running time, is entertaining stuff. Welcome bits of humor pepper the film, and for a PG rating there's even a dose of suggestively lewd conduct going down. But what really sells this film is Yul Brynner as the enigmatic, terrifying robot gunslinger gone rogue. When the Brimstone Kid flashes a smile in one scene, there's menace oozing from it. What Brynner also does here is wink at his \\"Chris Adams\\" role in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. WESTWORLD, in its own right, counts as one of Brynner's standout pictures.<br /><br />But, hey, whatever happened to the tourist who became the new sheriff? Or did I just miss seeing his sad corpse lying somewhere in Westworld?rynner also does here is wink at his \\"Chris Adams\\" role in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

B001UV4XWY|1.0|I remember seeing the previews of this movie and thinking it looked interesting..just watched the movie...absolutely AWFUL..i love movies and will watch most anything..i wasted 2 hours of my life...the only thing that kept me watching was cameron diaz..figured if she was in it, must end up decent (if it was an unknown, would've turned it off after 20 minutes)...DONT WATCH..nothing good about this..confusing boring....

1416955070|4.0|Clary Fray doesn't know how much her life will change when she spots two guys, one with a knife, following a couple into a dark part of a Manhattan nightclub. More importantly, she doesn't realize that it's the fact that she can see them that is going to change her life. Soon, her mother has disappeared, the man who is like a father to her refuses to help her, and she must turn to those very guys, Shadowhunters, to protect her from demons and to help her find her mother.<br /><br />City of Bones is part of the Mortal Instruments series, and in it author Cassandra Clare has imagined new worlds and new twists on old myths about vampire and werewolves, demons and angels, all while setting this first book in NYC. Many readers will see twists coming before Clary does, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of this book. I'm going to need to finish the trilogy before I'll know if I can put this one out for my students, but I'll definitely pass it on to my interested adult friends.
0451529308|5.0|After reading some of the 1 star reviews on this book, I know that some people might not like it because of how nice and perfect and possibly unrealistic the family is. While I have no problem with this viewpoint, I think otherwise. When I read this book, it's sort of like taking a break from the awful lives people live in this time period. It feels nice to just sit back and relax and imagine how nice life would be if, even though there may be arguements, they are small and unimportant compared to the hapiness that you can share with people. Yeah, that might have sounded pretty cheezy, but it's still nice to read some books like that.
B002VECM4A|3.0|Although I felt the use of the \\"F\\" bomb distracted from the dialog of the movie, I felt that the overall message was tremendous. A young girl refusing to continue to be a victim and choosing to work towards getting off of welfare is such a beautiful story. Precious chose to continue to get an education and to be a great mother to both of her children instead of allowing her mother to USE her and her children as welfare checks...WOW.  I hope more movies can be made with positive messages without foul language.

B001ECQ6PG|4.0|If you give yourself time to get familiar with the conversion software and the audio enhancing software before plunging right in and converting your vinyl then you will enjoy this turntable all the more. Yes, you can start converting almost 'out of the box' but take time to experiment with the software and you will end up finding the sound that you like with the conversions. You can get a decent digital conversion even with 'noisy' recordings - the only records that usually fail conversion quality are warped and it does not take much of a warp to ruin the sound - also of course highly scratched ones. I've made transfers of several vinyl records now and am very pleased with the turntable - a few quirks here and there but for the low price it is well worth the money and highly recommended.
B002MFU9BG|5.0|After a Kia commercial & Google search, I found the wonder that is \\"How You Like Me Now?\\" The song was so good in fact, I couldn't resist buying the full album, to which I implore you to do also. Stepping into the music of The Heavy, you know you're stepping into something special. The quality of some of the songs on this album is just so good, so energetic, it transcends almost everything else in rock n' roll over the past 10 years. Heck, Letterman even had them play an encore for the first time in his show's career. And after sampling The Heavy, you'll be hard-pressed not to order an encore as well.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />How You Like Me Now?<br />Short Change Hero<br />Long Way From Home<br />Cause for Alarm<br />Stuck<br /><br />Once you get past some of the more indie/experimental elements of the album towards the beginning, and as soon as it transitions to full rock mode, then the album is almost virtually untouchable. The Heavy sounds like a combination of James Brown meets The White stripes, meets The Who/Classic 60s Rock. I'll admit, this isn't the most original product in the history of music, or even in its own genre, but The Heavy plays better than most out there. They also do a pretty decent ballad.<br /><br />Overall, The Heavy mixes energy and soul into its blues rock, and brings out a killer combination. I can't recommend this album highly enough, and if you're a fan of modern indie or alternative rock, you'll be right at home. But even if you're not, The Heavy certainly does enough to convince you otherwise.
0439023483|5.0|I agree that there are parts of this book that are rather brutal and may be hard to read.  But it is practically impossible to put down.  I read it in less than a day and found myself getting so caught up in it that I could feel my adrenaline pumping. I have already read the 2nd book and can't wait to get my hands on the third.  Excellent writing and great characters.  I will be following Ms. Collins' work to see what comes next!
B002S0OBMS|5.0|If you like ALW's music, get this already and listen to it.  Listen to it a few times and the shock of something different will go away and you'll possibly be captured as I was by this glorious recording.  Unlike other reviews, I'm not going to comment on the show or the script, not having seen it.  I certainly don't feel let down that they've \\"changed\\" the characters.  I haven't been listening to the Phantom cast recording for twenty years because of the characters.  I thought the original Christine was a helpless dip and Raoul was an airhead.  They both sound more interesting and complicated this time.  Just as in Phantom, ALW can channel the essence of other musical styles, and even the Americanisms of the period.  This is fun.  Even better are the new lush, brain-exploding arias that made the original so great.  I really like The Beauty Underneath (the unpopular retro rock number) and like even more how it interplays with the exquisite Beautiful song.  Have a little faith, people.
B00064VR0W|5.0|I just received the DVD the other day, and started watching it today. All of his songs brought back many good memories from many years ago. Rod put a lot of heart and soul into this concert. I plan on watching it many times. My wife also likes him as well. I am sorry I never was able to catch him in concert. What great songs and what a great presence on stage!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie and are expecting the classic tail of the frog prince, then prepare yourself. It's nothing like it.    Ok. I will admit that I am 31 and I've already watched this movie 15 times in the Cinema, and that's not because my niece made me. This movie really brings back 2-D classic animation but not through elaborate action. What is surprising about the Princess and the Frog is how real the characters appear (from animation style to acting). There are emotional gestures performed by \\"Princess Tiana\\" that I had not seen in other Disney films. From a Plot perspective, the film is actually more mature than one might expect. It was interesting for me to see how much more I could identify with The Main characters (Tiana & Navin) then My own niece could. As a musical, It really is a Jazzy treat and a wonderful tribute to New Orleans' heritage.   This story is about dreaming big and working hard and mixing a little faith in the middle. In times like this, where adults seem to feel like we're loosing more than we gain and question where our hopes have gone, The Princess and the Frog brings a wind of hope for all.  It's innocent but mature. it's fascinating yet practical.    There are many great lessons in this movie to be learned for both children and adults.    I look forward to adding this to my Disney Library of classics
B002OB9KPE|5.0|I was eagerly expecting another BAF when the Whirlwind came out and I felt disappointed at first, but after a few listens, I realized this was a very special piece of music.  Yes, sure, the boys have mellowed a bit, after all it has been a few years since BAF and both Neal and Mike lost their father last year,  Still, they retain the old magic that made them great, Out of the Night, Evermore, Is It Really Happening, Lay down your Life, are memorable pieces, the instrumentals are flawless and Neal's spiritual offerings are not offensive to me in the least.  After all,  they define the man and I disagree strongly with those that say that this is another Neal Morse CD. I think he has stayed much more in the background on this one.  And really, can we not accept someone's spirituality on occasion, especially if it leads to good music - after all. have we not listened - and - enjoyed years of drug-induced music from some of the best and not turned away?...  This is so much better.  I am looking forward to Whirlwind's April 24th concert in Philadelphia...I cant wait !
B00275EGWY|2.0|I hadn't planned on watching this as I am a pacifist but a neighbor wanted to see it so rented it for me too. I returned it to Block Buster and was told that a woman directed it and was the first woman director to get best director. It struck me odd that a movie would win best director just because the director was a woman and not because of the movie's merits. I watched it and tried to understand it but got lost as to the plot and I didn't understand why the title \\"The Hurt Locker\\". The Hurt Locker sounds like a woman's fantasy. I think the director's imagination got the best of her and hopefully her next film will be less opinion and a little more factual. BTW I was 4 years in the Marines and not once did we act the way portrayed in the movie. There were other discrepancies like where did all that equipment appear from and the accuracy of the sniping was unbelievable. Off a mile on first shot and a kill on the second shot?
B001FB55LC|3.0|BROTHERS<br /><br />STARRING: Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Shepard, Bailee Madison, Taylor Geare, Patrick Flueger, Clifton Collins Jr., Ethan Suplee and Mare Winningham<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: David Benioff; based on the screenplay Bodre by Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Jim Sheridan<br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 04 December 2009<br /><br />I have always wondered if maybe Tobey Maguire had a dark side to him, buried away, deep behind that charming Peter Parker smile. Now that I have seen his disturbing performance in Brothers; I know that he does.<br /><br />He plays Capt. Sam Hill of the U.S. Marine Corps and he does it miraculously. At first everything seems to be ok with Sam. He has a wonderful wife and two beautiful kids; a strong relationship with his father and he loves and defends his brother. However, all of that is about to change.<br /><br />We learn early on in the film that he is to be shipped off to Afghanistan. He is proud to be a Marine and is equally proud to go.<br /><br />Just days before he leaves, his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is released from prison. We don't know why, but Sam's wife Grace (Natalie Portman) isn't very fond of him.<br /><br />Their father Hank (Sam Shepard) agrees with Grace entirely. In his eyes, the two brothers are worlds apart. Sam is the saint and Tommy is the family screw-up. Having been a Marine himself, Hank respects Sam and constantly puts Tommy down for not being more like his brother. There are some very well acted scenes between the three of these Hollywood greats; particularly the first dinner scene when Tommy is released from prison.<br /><br />It's not a hard sell at all to buy Gyllenhaal and Maguire as brothers. Several people over the years have commented on their similar looks; they have been mistaken for one-another; and at one point Gyllenhaal was rumored to be relieving Maguire in the Spider-Man franchise. Their on-screen chemistry is more than believable, so fans will enjoy their scenes together, as did I.<br /><br />The plot thickens when Sam's chopper goes down and he and his crew are believed to be dead. We know from the trailers, the opening credits saying Tobey Maguire's name first and just common movie-goer knowledge, that he is not dead. If you haven't seen the trailers, relax; it's revealed to us right away that he is alive.<br /><br />Himself and another soldier have in fact been captured by the Taliban and are brought to a secret hideout in the Afghan Mountains. Having done a tour of duty there myself, I can tell you that wherever they filmed this sequence is very close to the real deal.<br /><br />Sam is an officer and his counterpart is an enlisted Private. He constantly reminds him of their differences in rank throughout all of their scenes together.<br /><br />I found this annoying as I don't think that nine out of 10 soldiers would be that over-zealous about their rank in a situation like this, but there is always that one guy. And it does serve a purpose as Sam is very good at reading people and can see that this particular soldier is weak and will most likely not be able to handle whatever sadistic torture their captors have in store for them.<br /><br />I found the scenes in Afghanistan to be the most entertaining portion of the film and there are several of them. Tobey Maguire does an amazing job in these scenes and will show you dimensions of himself that you have never seen before. He is driven to do things that a lot of people may say they would never do in that situation; but I don't think any of us ever really know what we are or aren't capable of until we are put into a certain situation. This film will really make you ask yourself what you would do if you were in Sam's shoes.<br /><br />I'm displeased to report that the rest of the film was a letdown. The only positive thing I really took from the rest of it, were the amazing performances of all the actors. Therewasn't a single person in this film that didn't bring every bit of what they had to offer to each and every scene. Even small characters were casted well and delivered excellent performances. I don't know how they got Clifton Collins Jr. to do the two or three tiny scenes that he was in; but they did and he brought an impressive performance with him.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is as amazing as ever. She plays Grace so effortlessly and has great chemistry with the actors playing her family. In the scene where she receives the news of her husband's death, she goes from smiling to an absolute wreck without so much as a second going by.<br /><br />I feel Jake Gyllenhaal was cheated out of some screen time in the film. You never really got to know his character as well as you should have. Regardless of this, he still does a knock-out job with it anyway.<br /><br />The same goes for Sam Shepard. I felt like this character should have had either a bigger part in the story or a smaller one. With an actor like Sam Shepard, the answer better be bigger. We get absolutely no closure from his character's issues in the film.<br /><br />Scenes seem poorly edited and at times, too glamorized for this film. I feel like a lot of them were too bright and didn't fit well with the dark tones of the film as a whole.<br /><br />The most disappointing piece of the film was the romance between Tommy and Grace. I kept waiting for there to be this moment where they fall in love for each other and have a secret affair; but it never happens. They have one intimate moment where they share a kiss and both of them seem to regret it instantly and it is never brought up again; because right after it they discover Sam is still alive.<br /><br />I was expecting this huge love triangle to unfold. I think that based on the trailer and the poster alone, most would agree with me in thinking this is what was going to happen. There was opportunity after opportunity for there to be moments between them. Then when the romance never comes you are left wondering `what was the point of those scenes then?' Take the scene where she leaves in the middle of the night to go and pick Tommy up from the bar; or the idea of him offering to rebuild her kitchen for her. These are classic set-up scenes for a romance to ensue, and there is nothing!<br /><br />I get the feeling that the filmmakers' intentions were not to have the over-done love triangle, and instead let it all be in Sam's head. For some, this may be a pleasant aspect of the film. I can even appreciate the originality in that; it's just that I kept expecting these other things to happen and when they didn't, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I thought there would be hot and forbidden sex scenes; followed by the heart-throbbing suspense of them trying to cover it up, as they realize they are still in love even after Sam is back in the picture.<br /><br />What we get instead is Sam returning and being wacked out of his frigging mind from the trauma he experienced over there. He is deathly thin and this adds a great deal to him being creepy. His children are afraid of him and his wife looks at him as if he is another man altogether.<br /><br />Rather than the suspense, we just get what I would call annoying drama. Sam flat out confronts Tommy about sleeping with his wife, and Tommy never once denies having done so. Well no wonder the poor guy continues to think that something is going on!<br /><br />As if that wasn't bad enough, one of Sam's daughters is so distraught that her daddy isn't the same anymore, she screams at him and tells him that her mother and Tommy have sex all the time. She yells this in front of everyone at the dinner table, and neither Grace nor Tommy says anything to comfort Sam by assuring him, this is untrue. Had it happened, this would have been a little bit more tolerable; but it didn't! Nothing happened! So why wouldn't either of them say something to deny it?<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, therewas no justification for the daughter to act that way in the first place. There wasn't enough suspense of her daddy being frightening and different that would have caused her to do this. It seemed like two or three scenes between the two of them had been deleted and made it play-out wrong.<br /><br />It's not a bad movie; just not what I had anticipated and looked forward to it being, nor is it what it could have easily been. I'm sure a lot of people will still enjoy it. In the meantime, to hold me over until another film delivers hot steamy romance mixed with suspense and a classic love triangle; I suppose I can watch Pearl Harbor again.of the night to go and pick Tommy up from the bar; or the idea of him offering to rebuild her kitchen for her.

006621131X|5.0|I bought this based on the favorable NYTimes review and am so glad I did. This is a beautifully written, evocative and nostalgic memoir of the love and loss of two extremely talented individuals who followed their own paths in art and life but remained in love forever. Patti recounts her relationship with Robert with all the complexities it undoubtedly had, but Mapplethorpe could not have asked for a more sympathetic account of their time together. In addition to the human drama, would you like to know what NYC was like in the late sixties? Here is a clear window into a time and a place that are rapidly fading from memory, mine included. I forced myself not to devour this all at once. I sipped it like a vintage Armagnac. Patti Smith is a superb writer.

I felt like it would have been better in first person.<br />Also, the author writes from a female point of view, but he seems to have no comprehension of the female persona. Especially in a book about beauty.

1400052173|5.0|I grew up in East Baltimore in Baltimore, Maryland.  I lived about ten blocks from Johns Hopkins Hospital and always heard older people talking about others, especally African americans, who were missing due to experiments at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  I also remember going to Harriet Lane for medical care and never liked the dark feeling I always had when going there.  I also remember that my Mother never allowed the doctors to do anything to her children without her thoroughly discussing it and thinking about.  I asked her why and she said because she knew a lady a long time ago that came to JHH and strange things happened to her.  Because of this book, I now know why. I applaud the author for being brave and caring enough to write this story. Its a scandal and a shame that JHH never came to the family to help them really understand what happened to their Mother before the events written in this book became public and provide them with the compensation they should have gotten years ago for this.  I hope that many people read this book because it tells the truth about how medicine today has been able to advance due to the innocence and ignorance of one black women, Henrietta Lacks.
B002S0OBMS|3.0|\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a musical that holds a special place in my heart.  It was my first introduction to musical theater, so I am of course biased.  Andrew Lloyd Webber has revisited his most famous musical and created an interesting sequel.<br /><br />The sequel takes place ten years after the events of the first musical.  The show is set in New York on Coney Island.  Mr. Y, an aloof masked man, owns Phantasma, the most famous amusement park around.  Mr. Y is actually \\"The Phantom.\\" He has been spirited away from Paris by Madam Giry and her daughter, Meg.  The Phantom engages his love, Christine Daae, to sing at a performance given at the park.  He longs to hear her \\"sing once more.\\" Christine comes with her husband Raoul and her ten-year-old son, Gustav.  What follows is a plot of surprising revelations and a climactic and unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />The cast on this album is excellent! Ramin Koomiloo has a soaring voice that brought me to tears.  I would love to hear his rendition of songs from the original Phantom show.  Sierra Boggis is a superb Christine.  Her voice is gentle and soaring.  The other cast members are equally good, particularly the boy that portrays Gustav.<br /><br />So, why only 3 stars? I simply think the story is implausible.  The characters are more developed in this sequel, which is a good point.  However, their roles seem so reversed as to be unbelievable.  I am referring particularly to the character of Raoul, who has undergone a complete turnaround.  He is a vastly different man from the one who sang \\"All I Ask of You\\".  However, his song, \\"Why Does She Love Me?\\" redeems him somewhat.  The Phantom is now kind and none of his inegmatic and dangerous personality seems to remain.  Christine is still kind, but I miss her original innocent spirit.  I suppose we must all grow up.  I cannot say much more without revealing crucial points of the plot, but I will say that Meg Giry is excellently developed.  I love the twist that Webber incorporates with this character.<br /><br />The songs on this recording are good.  They do not have the memorability of the first show, but they do stand on their own.  I appreciate that Webber did not merely rehash old songs, although I question why \\"Music of the Night\\" was not alluded too.  I particularly enjoyed: \\"Only for Him,\\" \\"Till I Hear You Sing,\\" \\"Bathing Beauty,\\" \\"Once Upon Another Time,\\" \\"The Beauty Underneath,\\" \\"Devil Take the Hindmost,\\" and \\"Love Never Dies.\\" I think fans of the original show will enjoy this one simply because questions will be answered, but I do not think the original will ever be surpassed.  Anyway, happy listening, and God bless.is character.    The songs on this recording are good.  They do not have the memorability of the first show, but they do stand on their own.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Received and viewed my copy of 'O Brother, Where art Thou'.Great movie, on time shipping,and was in perfect condition.I was surprised that it was in wide screen format, as this was not stated anywhere in the advertising. At first I was annoyed,but my husband showed me how to view it on our DVD player as a full screen movie. OOPs!I'm not too technologically savvy, I guess. But, seriously, that fact should be stated prominently on DVDs for sale.
1591843162|5.0|I spent most of the time reading this book with a lump in my throat and a tightness in my chest that didn't let up until I finished.  Seth understands what it feels like to be the linchpin.  To know what would fall apart if you walked away from what you do.  The fact that he acknowledges that there is no map going forward makes the impact all the more poignant: the only plan forward is the one you create in your head. I'll probably have to sit for a couple more days blinking back tears.  But then I'm gonna get up and ship my art.  (PS - Seth, we met briefly. Page 201. Thanks again for coming.)

B0032KNA4I|2.0|There isn't a lot to say about 2012 so, let me start with the Blu-ray single disk version features and virtues. I will then say a few words about the movie itself.<br /><br />CONTENTS<br /><br />This release comes with:<br /><br />- an alternate ending (not very interesting)<br />- a picture-in-picture commentary - every now and then a little window opens in the lower right section of the screen and team members discuss various aspects of movie making<br />- alternate sound track commentary<br />- MovieIQ - a feature seen in other Sony Blu-ray features, offers access to an online movie database that displays information related to the scene playing. One neat feature allows you to get the MovieIQ info synced in real time and have it displayed on your computer or iPhone.<br /><br />- 1080p HD at 2.40:1<br />- 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound is available in English and French<br />- Subtitles in English and French<br /><br />TECHNICAL MERIT<br /><br />Regardless of the movie's artistic merits, the audio-visual execution is impeccable. Anyone into disaster/destruction thrills should seek this movie. The CGI is realistic to the minutest of details and the surround sound engineers made sure that you will feel the collapse of the Earth's crust pounding in your tummy - if you play it loud enough.<br /><br />THE PREMISE<br /><br />As it was the case with 'The Day After' - global warming triggers a new ice age - the 2012 science ranges somewhere halfway between implausible to plain ridiculous. The idea that neutrinos coming out of the Sun \\"mutate\\" into a different particle and heat up the Earth's core (but not, let's say, the scientists who came up with the explanation) would cause most physicists to either pull their hair in frustration or laugh uncontrollably. And I won't even touch the mystical aspect (Mayan predictions) which make it all so much confusing: was there some supernatural force that forced the Sun to produce 'mutated' neutrinos? We don't know.<br /><br />A lot of the movie's science is ridiculous beyond belief. Overnight thousand-mile shifts of Earth's crust or the magnetic pole moving to Wisconsin would be outcomes of changes so catastrophic, we would see not mile-high tsunamis but watch (so to speak) the entire planet break into pieces. My impression is that the script writers either had no idea of what they were writing about or maybe they underestimated the audience's ability to detect nonsense when 'scientific words' were used. Quite depressing.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />Well... we have two main threads. It's the end of life as we know it, with billions dying and, equally important, the story of Jackson's (John Cusack) family that starts as 'split' (divorce?) but, by the time the Himalayas go under water, they are reunited and it's reasonable to assume that they won't separate again, at least not before the children grow up or another disaster affects the family's inegrity.<br /><br />RATING<br /><br />I will give this movie 2 stars for the picture and the sound effects. And these are not 'cheap thrills' given the $200 million budget. Sadly, there's not much more there. A little bit of humor when portraying a Russian tycoon and an end of the world enthusiast living in a tent at Yellowstone (they both die) and John Cusack's reliably good performance and not much else.<br /><br />I'm afraid that many viewers may find watching this movie a waste of their time.f the movie's science is ridiculous beyond belief.

B0036B8MZU|5.0|Great week after week writing,directing and acting. I keep expecting the series to get too routine and predictable like other series, they start out great and then get mundane and boring. But the writers keep it fresh and new. To much male skin and not enough female skin for my taste though. Will definitely add this series to my collection with a little bit of editing of course.

0316154687|3.0|I disclose up front that I am a huge Sedaris fan.  \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was one of the most acidly funny books I ever read, and his short story \\"The Santaland Diaries\\" is nothing less than a masterpiece.  And, I do not expect Sedaris to be \\"funny.\\"  Much of his most elegant prose, especially about his family, is not.  But I admit to being very disappointed in \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames.\\"<br /><br />I cannot explain exactly why I was disappointed.  It's not that the writing, overall, was bad.  It was just not terribly interesting.  And while I got the point of tales like his companion, Hugh, proving his love by treating a noisome boil, for example, the world-weary, catty observational humor and the high-strung emotionalism just largely fell flat this time, almost sounding contrived.  And the last tale about quitting smoking in Tokyo was, in my opinion, a stream of consciousness nightmare.  And overall, there is a gloom settled over these pages.  Since this was Sedaris' \\"mid-life crisis\\" book, I cannot object to that overmuch, but the sometime artless joylessness made \\"Engulfed\\" a numbing chore.<br /><br />But, the book has side-splitting and thoughtful gems, too.  The tale of Mrs. Peacock, the smelly babysitter from hell, the external catheter called \\"The Stadium Pal,\\" and a harrowing piece about the nature of guilt and shame when he befriends an old sex offender shunned by society are Sedaris at his vintage best.  Funny, but always thought provoking.<br /><br />So, on balance, half the book is wonderful, half less so.  If you are a Sedaris fan, you will enjoy it, but be prepared for some odd forays that do not work well.  If you are new to Sedaris, this is not the book for you.  \\"Naked,\\" \\"Barrel Fever,\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" are where your attention should be.<br /><br />Recommended, but with noted reservations.

0307454541|2.0|The first book in Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy is many things: a murder case, a financial intrigue, a family saga, and an (ersatz) feminist revenge fantasy. Its extraordinary popularity is almost certainly due to its partaking of the last category. Larsson's tale dwells uncomfortably on the horrible things that can be accomplished by \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" (the transliteration of the work's original Swedish title), and then tries to balance the score by offering elaborate retaliations visited upon the misogynists by the novel's avenging angel, an antisocial young woman named Lisbeth Salander who works as a researcher for a security firm. The novel tries to have it both ways: it offers Old Testament-style atrocities committed against women for us (and the novel's soft hero, Mikhael Blomkvist) to cluck over, and also to titillate us; then it offers Salander's vengeance schemes ostensibly to balance the injustices committed against women but really to titillate us even further. It's like \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" but imagined in terms of gender politics. Unfortunately, Salander is not as imaginative a creation as many fans of the book have proposed, and seems all too reminiscent of the many fabulous femmes fatales with attitude and technological know-how who have become archetypes of postmodern espionage stories, from Modesty Blaise to Sydney Bristow to La Femme Nikita; moreover, her willingness to sexually please her partner and only friend Blomkvist without him ever asking complicates any claims some have made that this novel truly champions feminism.<br /><br />The novel works best in its central section, a complex mystery involving the disappearance of an industrial heiress on her family's private island more than thirty years previous to the main events of the novel: the sinister secrets of the Vanger family make the novel work here as a very gripping and dark family saga. Unfortunately, this plot is book-ended by a subplot involving financial intrigue that almost bored me into giving up the novel initially, and that I couldn't wait to get through in its final one hundred or so pages. The international success of the novel is undeniable, and at the very least the work is worth picking up just to see how Larsson can strike so many chords that resonate with a contemporary readership.me into giving up the novel initially, and that I couldn't wait to get through in its final one hundred or so pages.

B001OQCV2O|3.0|My girlfriend picked this over my choice Precious at Wal-Mart tonight. I have to commend the directors for the visual effects and the sound on blu-ray.     The entire movie as you might guess is predictable. The story is on life support at best.     But the worst part is that the government officials are pretty much the only the survivors. Its 2 hrs and 37 minutes long and the effects start after the first hr. If the story had been focused on the one scientist who gave so much life to the story it would have been a better movie. Instead it on John Cusacks character and his multiple failures as a husband, father and author.     So like I said in the title watch once for the effects and avoid buying it if possible.
B00005V9HH|3.0|The Usual Suspects stars Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Benico Del Toro and Kevin Pollak as five small-time criminals that get involved with a strange scheme I found hard to understand.  The first scene is a line-up for a trumped up charge and as they wait together a plot is hatched to combine forces.<br /><br />Several crimes are committed successfully, leading up to one big hit for $91 million dollars.  Beyond that there is a sub-plot of Keyser Soze, a terrible, secretive, underworld killer gang leader that no one can prove is real, other than stories of his cold, horrendous temper and killing binges.<br /><br />Because some of the dialogue is not easily understood, it was hard to keep an interest in most of the movie.  The final thirty minutes make the Usual Suspects worth watching, strange yet fascinating surprise ending.
0545123267|5.0|The writing is quite exquisite and even poetic; I lost the sense that I was reading a YA novel. The characters and their emotions were tightly drawn, and the questions the story brought up about the nature of self/identity were surprising. Although there isn't much \\"action\\" that one might find in other fantasy novels, the empathy I felt for Sam and Grace was well worth the read.
B00328G4XY|5.0|It's been almost forty years since Jimi Hendrix's untimely death.  As part of a reissue program, Experience Hendrix has reissued deluxe editions of his classic studio albums.  For this longtime fan, ELECTRIC LADYLAND from 1968 is the ultimate Hendrix album.  It's the album where he most fully untilized the studio to create his most enduring album.<br /><br />There's not much to add to everything that's been written about this album, so I'll limit my comments to what's new with this 2010 edition:<br /><br />The CD:  The sticker on the shrink wrap says \\"Digitally Remastered,\\" but I'm not sure there is a difference between this and my 1997 reissue. I'm not saying the sound isn't great; I'm just saying I don't notice a difference. [Note:  my guess is they are simply playing fast and loose with the wording.  After all, it IS digitally remastered; it's just not NEWLY remastered.Both releases were remastered by Eddie Kramer and George Marino.] This reissue contains all 16 original tracks--no bonus material.  Running time - 75:27<br /><br />The Booklet:  Thirty-six pages.  Lot's of great photos, including an alternate image (which Jimi hated!)from the UK cover photo session. An essay by Derek Taylor. Six pages of Jimi's original handwritten notes for the album. [Everything from the 1997 reissue is included in this booklet with additional photos and some minimal changes in the original layout.]<br /><br />The DVD:  There are no complete songs.  A very limited amount of concert footage and nothing filmed during the actual sessions.  Mostly on camera interview with original sound engineer Eddie Kramer playing snippets of tracks from the album.  Also includes on camera interviews with Chas Chandler, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding. At no time during the video does Jimi talk about the album. Overall, an interesting video, but won't bear repeated viewings.  The inclusion of this short DVD is the major difference between this and the 1997 reissue.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I am so so impressed with this album.  There is not one ballad on here that disappoints the soul.  Alicia is so talented and beautiful and like the creator this is just a stunning piece of work.  The beats on this are fab as well.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This show is absolutely wonderful. It is intelligent, funny, and extremely well written. If you enjoy a show that has witty, charismatic characters, or you love science, this is the show for you. Everything is well thought out and well researched, the plot is very captivating, and I am desperately drooling the release of the second season! An absolute must have!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|The are already a number of very good, heavy duty reviews with the Otaku styling on here - so I will just say that if you are, for any reason, hesitating about whether to buy this, stop it right now. Buy it! It is stunningly awesome. Perhaps a little sparse in the extras department, but there's a way that the 15 minute long meditation on how the animation developed from sketches to final product is just about all I need. I like my eva to remain shrouded in a bit of mystery.
0061730327|5.0|Wow. William Kamkwamba has restored my faith in humanity. What a beautiful story, a brutal tale of poverty, and a wonderful glimpse in to the mind of an incredibly bright man. I will recommend it to everyone that I know. Thank you, William!
B00280LYIC|5.0|If you love Harry Potter, than you'll love this series. I could say endless great things about this book, but don't take my word for it, read it yourself.
B000JIHP88|5.0|After a lot of looking, I finally decided on the FP Rainforest Mobile.  My daughter (3 months) loves looking at it.  What I like is that the music and movement are both gentle enough not to over stimulate her, but fun enough to watch that it entertains her.  We have not yet used the nightlight, but I'm sure we will when she gets a little older.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|Boondock Saints 2 is an absolute travesty.  It was like the director forgot what made the first one so enjoyable and try to emulate it anyway. Characters don't act a thing like they did in the first one. The action scenes are just boring. The brothers just stand like five feet away from the goons and not get shot once while they blow away like 7 or 8 people.  They don't move at all! they just stand perfectly still and the frackin henchmen aren't able to hit them at all.  The person who they replaced Dafoe's character with is a terrible actress and over all the acting is worse than the first one.  Please don't waste your time with this piece of garbage.
0385523904|4.0|The book follows the life of several North Koreans in North Korea before they escaped. Most of the time covered is from the late 1980's to the early part of this century, with the worst famine being in the middle of this time. They lived lives we would find hard to imagine, describing loosing family members to starvation, of foraging for weeds, not being able to tell even their closest friend what they thought of the government, and of using a pin to slip through the seal on the controls of a TV so it can be set to forbidden South Korean channels.   It is very interesting how people adapted to this bizarre world without even realizing how wrong it was. One thin woman, who had already lost her son to starvation, remained a proud nationalist and would not defect, even though her daughter was begging her, till, after being tricked into crossing the border into China, she saw an automatic rice cooker. A scene that said a lot: a young woman in prison sees a farm woman on the other side of the fence and wants her to take a message to her family as to where she is. As payment the prisoner on the spot removes her underwear and gives it to the farm woman, because that's how valuable used underwear can be in North Korea.      One could wonder if the book distills too much of the suffering and doesn't share enough of the happier moments, but I've stood on the border of North and South Korea, and looking across saw just a few feet away the gaunt, and weathered North Korean guards, several inches shorter than the South Korean guards, who suddenly looked so soft and baby faced. This book lets you see a lot farther across the border.
B002NUULNG|5.0|Quality redraw of the original 1995 masterpiece.  BD also includes the original anime and the Oshii interview from the Special Edition set.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Very good suspense movie.  A different twist on suspense. Sharon Stone really lived the part.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|The movie is excellent, and I am so glad I got the digital copy, now my kids can watch the movie anytime on my iPod =)
B002D4J8RC|1.0|Not worth the plastic it's recorded on.  This is not even music it's noise with auto tuned lip syncing.....waste of time.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|This is a great movie and I desperately want it on blu-ray. That's it, just blu-ray. I have a blu-ray player. That's why I want the blu-ray. Why would I want the DVD as well? That's right I don't. I also don't want to watch it on a phone, so I don't need the stupd digital copy that doesn't even work in other countries and even if it did it only works for a limited time then I am stuck with the useless disc in my case forever. I only want to buy the blu-ray. This really sucks.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|We are having so much fun as a family watching this series. (We never watched it when it was on tv.) It is very addictive and it is hard to stop watching. What a great show. In today's world where it is hard to find a family show to watch we can now sit down as a family and enjoy watching tv together. This show is funny and constantly keeps you on your toes. You find you are swept away to Stars Hollow and are one of it's citizens. We are currently on the 3rd season and we started watching on Valentines Day. This has been a great weekend activity. My husband (Mr. Football himself) is really enjoying it with us. If you are looking for viewing entertainment this is definitely it. Wonderful show!!!!!! 5 Star show
B00337KM2S|2.0|I am glad someone else enjoyed this!  I am a huge George Clooney fan, but was terribly disappointed. With most every aspect of the movie.  Sorry, but I am glad I rented and didn't buy.  If you buy, you may love it. I hope you do, but I will not  recommend it to anyone I know.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|If the songs were aranged  a bit better, it would feel as succesful a rock opera as Green Day's. Despite that, the wild switch in styles from song to song still works, and is great fun to listen to. You can hear the influence of other bands so strongly, almost as if they have someone from depeche mode, or queen, or whoever, sitting in on a song).  And as others say, the dare to add some classical infusion (and Sampson and Delilah of all things) was the first time I heard it, shocking. (WTF?). But after a few listens, I find a really injoy it - I look forward to it.  Despite starting out sounding like a run of the mill pop album, it goes off the rails, and I love it.
1400031567|5.0|This was a fine very readable book and I intend to read more by the author. It didn't have any of the usual boring filler material many authors use to make the reader patiently wait to find out the ending.  Every part is interesting and advances the plot.   All the other reviewers will tell you about the story which of course was far fetched:  like how often do people do murders like these murders?  The character of Wallander was very interesting as he slouches toward the solution. What amazed me was this.  I was also reading \\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\\" by Malcolm Gladwell and it amazed me that Wallander solved the crime trying his best to use those techniques as well as the usual interview and trace CSI stuff.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I just graduated bootcamp when I saw this film. I am a 21 Bravo (Combat Engineer) and we don't have a safe job either- but nothing like EOD. Overall everything they taught us in Basic and AIT is like the same for this film. This film is neither pro or anti-war and just shows how a job like this is handled everyday by men and women on the battlefield. The war we've been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan is nothing like before and IEDs are a major play in it. The Enemy is a coward and doesn't wear uniforms so they sneak and threaten democracies and certain people by terrorizing them. This enemy only shows why we are over there and why the job must be won. We can question whether or not it was right to go over there, but we need to finish the job. This film does justice and shows how EOD stuggles day to day.
B003102JDM|1.0|Every other one of the Coen brothers movies I have seen I loved and was excellent.  This one is just not at all interesting.  Goes into religious stuff on a superficial level but not in any heart felt way.  The acting is not particularly good and none of the characters portrayed are at all endearing or, for that matter, relevant.  The odd little \\"story\\" at the beginning has absolutely no relevance and appears to be dumped there to give an artificial aura of hidden meaning which turns out to be unfulfilled. Not a good watch not uplifting in any way.    Hey these guys have put out some of the best movies ever...They can have a flop...it's OK.  What is not OK is for you to put your money into buying this waste of time.  Watch it at a friends house of look for it when the price goes down to less than a dollar at your local Wallmart.  Silly bit of Blackish, sort of funny, more embarrassing than humorous fluff.
B00337KM2S|4.0|This movie did an amazing thing it took a fairly serious look at downsizing at a personal level at various companies, but it made me smile almost all the way through the movie. The movie took place in cities like Omaha, Des Moines, Milwaukee and Detroit. The movie didn't pull punches at the final interviews. I've been downsized and this felt real. These people were hurting in different ways. The laughable help the company provides for placement was just right. My manager gave me a help wanted page ad from the local paper for a job $40k less than my current salary and for which I wasn't really qualified. He must have spent a minute looking for it. However, the movie did not lambaste the companies. The companies were hurting too.  The movie did not take the obvious route in most of the movie. There were some nice twists.     The actors were all good, but George Clooney was great. He exhibited just the right amount of charm and denial. He was going through a mid life crisis and there were no easy answers. He had the life he wanted, but realized it was empty. He daily job of firing people emphasized his own emptiness. Clooney's character was an inspirational speaker too. His speech was hilarious and scary. Some people think this way.      Jason Bateman was good too. He played the boss, who was trying to run the company the best way he knew how, but basically was an insensitive jerk. Who else could come up with a company like this?     I strongly recommend the movie. It has comedy, charm, and pathos. It is a great look at our society and what it values.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Sade is one of my favorite artist and she puts on one of the best concerts I've ever, I mean EVER, witness.  When I heard Sade was releasing a new CD, it was a must have.  I pre-ordered it so I could have it the first day it was released.  First of all, Sade is back... sounding good and looking good as ever.  The bad news is the CD did not meet my expectations.  This is why I waited so long to write a review, giving the CD a chance to grow on me.  This project failed to pull me into Sade's  world, and I wanted to be pulled in sooooo baaad.  I liked \\"Solider of Love\\", \\"Babyfather\\", and \\"In Another Time,\\" but as a project something was missing and I can't quite put my hands on it (probably because of my jaded Sade glasses).  But do be warned, don't play this CD while driving tired (DWT), playing this CD and DWT is a no-no....  Since it's been 20+ years since Sade & the band played together, this CD was probably the trial run project, giving them a chance to get familiar with each other again.  So the next project should be off the chain, as long as they don't wait another 20+ years to produce it....  In summary, I blame this mediocre project on the band, surely it's not my Boo's, Sade, fault....
B002T9H2LA|1.0|I wish I would have known I was going to have to read the Movie  before I bought it. tried 3 times to get thru it  but got sick of reading subtitles and then backing up to see  what was going on
0316069906|5.0|I've read & respected both Michael Pollen & Barbara Kingsolver's books & thought this book might just rehash what I already knew, not so!  The author touches on other important issues such as antibiotic resistance/new pathogens emerging & the global significance of meat consumption.  He fairly explores both side of the issues.  I've always been interested in animal welfare (as well as my own) & was surprised how much this book has already changed my life.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|This is a good thriller, with Melissa George turning in an intelligent, haunted performance.    At several points it seems as if it is going to reprise some other well-known movies that involve terror at sea. As the friends set out in their yacht for a pleasant, unsuspecting day - a strange storm cloud overtakes them, suggesting the transformation that created \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man.\\" Later, as they board the seemingly deserted, antique ocean liner, we think of movies such as \\"Outward Bound\\" with its cast doomed to sail in limbo. Then when we realize that the ship might not be deserted enough, that there might be a homicidal maniac aboard - we think of movies such as the Billy Zane/Nicole Kidman thriller \\"Dead Calm.\\"    However the movie doesn't follow closely in the wake of any of these movies. It sets off into uncharted territory of its own. Although some of the assaults seem a little too repetitious, the atmospherics aboard the liner are likely to hold you in suspense.     But this isn't a movie for those who demand pat answers. However I suggest you check out the brief bonus materials on the DVD. There's no Director's Commentary, but there is a short series of interviews with some of the stars and other people involved in the making of \\"Triangle.\\" In the very last comment elicited in this series, the star suggests an interesting way to interpret some of the plot elements here. She might have hit on something. The film certainly leaves you with something to think about.
B001UDYI9K|5.0|This is a good cd to go to sleep with, or read a book to.  It may not be as awesome as APP but wonderful in Eric's way.  You are missed.
0802130208|5.0|Set in early `60's New Orleans.  The protagonist Ignatius Reilly is an educated nut who lives with his imbecile, muscatel addled mother.  The story is eccentric.  But what's fabulous about the book is the dialog.  It's hysterical.  Every line is a rich nugget of invective or stupidity.  And every character is an idiot in one way or another.  Ignatius is a lunatic, but wildly clever in how he expresses his universal misanthropic disdain and contempt.  I read some of the insults over and over for laughs.    P.S. Shame about the author though...
0740748475|5.0|Finally, every comic Bill Waterson owns up to publishing, in one handy, albeit massive, collection.  The reality of Calvin and Hobbes hits far too close to home for me.  My own mother accuses me of being the role model for this character (my name is also Calvin), and she frequently would laugh, shake her head, and say, \\"Yep, that was you alright! Remember when you used to...\\" and launch into reveries of memories I would rather forget.  It took many years of counseling and therapy to recover from my childhood; perhaps mom was right.  Without Hobbes as constant companion, I might never have come out of it.  This set should be read front to back for anyone contemplating having children.  Parents would be forewarned and forearmed, children would be better understood, and we might even eliminate the abortion issue.  If you knew your kid would turn out like this, you would avoid getting married.  With some of the keenest insight into human nature (sometimes dark, dangerous human nature), and always a humorous viewpoint, with the occasional bottom-of-your-soul thoughts, this collection is Highly Recommended to everyone who ever read Calvin and Hobbes, and is essential to those who were never exposed while this phenomenon ran its course in daily publication.  Get yours soon, he's not making any more of them...   [[ASIN:0740748475 The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (Calvin & Hobbes) (v. 1, 2, 3)]]
B002VECM4A|5.0|\\"Precious\\" is one of those movies I cannot imagine watching again, if only because the subject matter is so harrowing and the message so powerful that it suffices to watch it once. Based on the novel [[ASIN:0307474844 Precious (Push Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage Contemporaries)]] by Sapphire, the story traces the \\"awakening\\" of an abused teen Clarisse aka Precious (Gabourey Sidibe in a powerful screen debut) from a lifetime of abuse and neglect to a new life of promise and hope. Precious is an obese and lonely teenager who has suffered immense pain at the hands of her parents - her mother, Mary (Mo'nique whose credible portrayal of a cruel and abusive mother won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) has been systematically abusing Precious over the years, blaming her for 'stealing' her man, i.e. Precious' father (who has been sexually abusing Precious since she was three, and who has fathered two children with Precious). In school, Precious is almost invisible, not being able to read, and it is only when her second pregnancy is discovered that she is recommended for alternative education.<br /><br />It is here that Precious' life takes a turn for the better - finally, a teacher 'sees' Precious as an individual, cares about her welfare and takes an interest in her education. This plays out credibly on-screen and it's not like Precious finds her path immediately and achieves self-actualization. The path to finding her true potential is a long and arduous one, but Precious gradually realizes that she needs to put a stop to the cycle of abuse and take responsibility for her own life as well as those of her two young children. The scenes of abuse are juxtaposed against 'daydream'/fantasy scenes where Precious imagines the life she wishes for herself - being a glamorous celebrity signing autographs, dancing in the spotlight with a handsome young man, singing in a church choir...these scenes are compelling because they provide us insight into Precious' mind and soul, and convince the viewer that a tortured and damaged soul like Precious can still dream of a promising future.<br /><br />The performances are heartbreaking as they are compelling - and there are two more notable performances here, i.e. Paula Patton's luminescent portrayal as Precious' teacher at the alternative school (with an equally inspiring name Blu Rain), and also Mariah Carey in a unglamorous, sans make-up role portraying a welfare worker. Ultimately, Precious' story is one of grace and human dignity under the most trying circumstances. Powerful indeed.e viewer that a tortured and damaged soul like Precious can still dream of a promising future.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|But truly the visuals make up for it in this movie.  And the cast is great, they do their best with what they have to work with.  The plot could have been better but the visuals and effects are worth seeing this for!
B001AQT11M|5.0|I thought that my three year old granddaughter would love this movie because she is so into all of the Disney Princess thing. She was okay with it until the Wicked Witch came on. Got very scared and won't watch it. I love it and will put it away until she is a little older.
B00280LYHS|5.0|i havint read this book yet but if is as good as his other books than ill give it 5 stars. asome books!!!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I have a large number of movies and consider myself as well versed on all styles of movies. Avatar is the BEST movie I have ever seen. I went to see it at the theater 3 times and that is something I have never done before. I just couldn't get enough of it. The story is wonderful and the graphics are amazing! I've already signed up to be alerted as soon as it comes out on DVD.
0385523904|5.0|I heard the author on NPR.  Her story of Mi-ran and Jun-sang, two young North Korean sweethearts who make separate but parallel journeys to freedom, was riveting.  The other stories inside the book are equally compelling.  I could not put it down.  I hope Ms. Demick is shopping the rights for a movie script.  I would love to see the account of Mi-ran and Jun-sang made into a film.  It would be Oscar-worthy.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|I was waiting for the price of this blu ray to come down. It finally did... It's just great fun to watch and intelligent movie. The sound is superb, completely immersing the listener with a clear soundscape of wide dynamic range . The CGI looks a little outdated sometimes, but the general look is excellent. Great detail, bold colors and subtle gradations. Nice acting too. I love this film.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I added this release to my Sade playlist, and it melded perfectly with her other music.  If you're a Sade fan, you'll love Soldier.
B00338QENI|5.0|I found that i could not put this book down! It was thought provoking and well written. Very good insight into the history of medicinal research in the U.S. and how people are used in this country without their knowlege to \\"further the common good\\". Paints a very good picture of how the less fortunate among us can be used to further the quality of health care in the United States without being able to afford the benefits that they helped create!! A very timely book for the current health care debate!
B001RTP48G|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of the Pet Shop Boys in the 80's.  I liked alternative and heard most of their stuff, but they always seemed a little too fluffy to me.  I realize they've been big in Europe for years but I just couldn't get into them.  So this was the first album I bought from them and I must say, I was truly amazed.  I do quite a bit of research to find good music and I bought this album with a bit of trepidation.  But I can honestly say this was my favorite album for 2009.  It is amazing.  I've even tried listening to some of their older music but their newest is still the best (IMO).  I just hope this is a sign of things to come and not the flash of a setting sun.  Check out \\"Minimal\\" on one of their single B-sides also for more of the same.  I never thought I'd say it but the PET SHOP BOYS rock!
0307588335|5.0|I found Larry McDonald's book an easy and spellbinding read. He seems to have nailed the fatal flaws in Lehman Brothers and indeed on Wall Street that led us to the financial mess which we all continue to endure. It's a pity that perhaps millions more were spent in an official report released in March, 2010 that tracks the observations and conclusions of this fine book. I highly recommend it to anyone off Wall Street.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Five stars for Leonardo's brilliant acting in Shutter Island, a film that keeps you on edge from beginning to end with its numerous twists and unexpected turn of events, with its fusion of dream and reality, making it impossible to discern where one ends and the other begins.    Leonardo Dicaprio plays the role of Edward Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who has been given the authority to investigate the case of a missing female prisoner on Shutter Island, a prison for insane criminals. The woman has disappeared under obscure and inexplicable circumstances; circumstances that defy common sense.  Edward and his partner Mark, (Chuck Ruffalo) set about to unravel the mystery of the disappearance with the reluctant assistance of the two psychiatrists,Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow.  Shutter island has three wards, A, B, and C ,the last being the one where the extremely dangerous inmates are held.  This ward looms menacingly over the island as it is situated on a hill, its grey stone walls shrouded in mystery and foreboding,  entrance being restrictedto to personnel only.  Edward is immediately drawn by the place, sensing that the solution to the mystery resides within the gloomy depths of those high walls.    While on Shutter Island, Edward is haunted by images of Dachau and emaciated prisoners, bodies of women and children piled up, frozen in time, an eerie monument of accusation for the indifference shown by the rest of the world in its criminal reluctance to act promptly and thus avert one of the most horrendous crimes against humanity. He relives the U.S. Army's entry into this place of  horror and is persecuted by feelings of guilt,  guilt which haunts our hero Edward throughout the film; he is also haunted by dreams and visions of his dead wife during his stay on the island. She acts as a kind of Cassandra warning him about the place, telling him that all is not as it seems.  Sinister practices may in fact be taking place there, particularly in the isolated and inaccessible lighthouse, which as its name implies, is where our hero will be enlightened about his case and the facts about Shutter island.    The film is splendid in depicting the workings of the mind like \\"a wheel within a wheel, never ending or beginning, like an ever spinning reel\\". The flashbacks and his dreams are filmed in a bright yellow light, whereas his reality on the island is shrouded in mist.  After a certain point in the film it becomes hard to distinguish whether what he experiences is real or delusional, whether it is his dreams that are part of reality and his presence on the island a dream. The chase scene in ward C is stunning as it is an allegory of Edward's mind, dark and unfathomable, full of perilous routes and dangerous pitfalls. This scene is fraught with suspense and tension, worthy of old cinematographic masters, reminiscent of that brilliant chase scene in the sewers in \\"The Third Man\\". Scorsese portrays with brilliance the labyrinth our hero is caught up in, his mind being a dark and inscrutable maze from which he has to exit to see the 'light'.    Ben Kingley is the epitome of the ambiguous psychiatrist whose real motives we are never quite certain of.  Is he, in fact, an altruistic scientist or an evil twisted genius involved in unethical practices with a nazi doctor (Max Siddow)?  As a viewer one must be on the alert, prepared for the unexpected and to be aware of symbolism and metaphor in interpreting the events as they occur.  There is a lot of Freudian psychology so if you are fond of psychological thrillers then this film will most definitely keep you at the edge of your seat with its fascinating plot and superb acting.

B002S0OBN2|4.0|I am a huge \\"Phantom\\" phan! I ran all over my house like a mad man when I heard there was a sequel to my most favorite musical of all time!    The highlights of the soundtrack are the songs sung by the Phantom, Christine, or both! Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess have exceptional voices and are brilliantly cast in their roles! When either of them sing, I just close my eyes and let the music take over.     The orchestra is great throughout the recording. I especially love hearing the electric guitars!     Unfortunately, I am having trouble forming an emotional connection with the other characters and the songs they sing are okay but not as good as the ones sung by Phantom and Christine but then again, they are all still new and unfamiliar to me.      My absolute favorite song is \\"Til I Hear You Sing.\\" When I listen closely to the lyrics, I can feel the Phantom's deep desire for Christine. Oh! It gives me goosebumps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Though the musical hasn't \\"Stunned\\" me thus far, I am not giving up on it. I know after listening to the soundtrack more and more it will grow on me! And I still intend to see the show when it opens on Broadway this November! Judging it too harshly is unfair considering the fact that it is still new and people haven't had alot of time to get used to the story and songs yet! Remember, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" wasn't considered an instant classic when it opened in london over 20 years ago!! Give it a chance!!!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This should be in everyones music library.  No matter what your personal musical taste, MJ's music will fit.  Always and forever.
B0032W7D08|5.0|From their edgy album \\"Demon Days\\", the Gorillaz have come a long way. The album begins with an orchestral score that as it fades out is chopped into a beat. The lead in to the next song has a more hip-hop/electrical feel and adds Snoop Dogg's vocals to the mix. One can compare the use of horns, chopped vocals, and ambient world sounds to early musique concrete. The beats and music are made out of everyday sounds, but are arranged in a way to carry the tune. The rhythms in \\"White Flag\\" are superb. This song also begins with an orchestral score, but quickly changes to a snappy beat overlayed with vocals. The beats sound almost industrial, with a heaviness and strict rhythm reminiscent of factory machines. \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" has very abstract electrical beats with a morphed voice overlay. This is a more technical development on early electronische music, the sounds are much more processed and are of high quality. \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\" uses a clip from what appears to be an early 1950s commercial. This addition, along with electric beats, is similar in composition to Stockhausen's later work when he compared musique concrete with electronische. \\"Empire Ants\\" has a tranquil feel. It's wailing vocals and undulating beats have a trance like quality to them. The beats are not quite intense enough to be compared to Goa trance, but the emotional product from the music is nearly the same. \\"Glitter Freeze\\" has a very rudimentary electronic beat to it, which is reminscent of early techno music. The harsh but rhythmic sound with neat robotic vocals was has a Kraftwerk feel to it. Kraftwerk, of course, used very robotic beats and would often produce a very noisy but very rhythmic end product. The vocals in \\"Glitter Freeze\\" are very impersonal, they sound like a chopped tape recording over the main beats. The song \\"To Binge\\" uses an instrument that sounds like an electronic organ. The sound quality is similar to that produced by the Telharmonium; the song has a sort of carnival feel to it. \\"Cloud of unknowing\\" uses nature sounds at the very beginning of the piece. The listener is greeted to the track by the sound of waves crashing on a vacant shore. Seagulls can be heard calling off in the distance. In this aspect, the use of nature to make music reminds me of MICE compositions, the sound is processed and is produced in the song to draw emotion from the listener. \\"Pirate Jet\\" has vocals producing a very rhythmic beat. The vocals are processed and sound very canned and robotic. Perhaps they were processed through a program like SPEAR; it feels as if the voice is no longer human but is instead an electrical percussion instrument. What is revolutionary about this album is that all of these historical electronic influences are combined to produce a very unique sound. It can't be defined as rap, as some of the vocals are almost operatic. It can't be defined as rock due to its very rhythmic and patterned feel. Electronic does not even begin to encompass the vast use of other instruments. Thus, the listener is left to decide what to call Plastic Beach, and how to define it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a true story based on a dog's love and devotion that far exceeds what the majority of human beings are capable of in their own relationships, but value so highly..  The empathy the viewer has for this main character reaches deep into our own desire to know love in such an honest and pure form, and it is a wonderful story for the entire family.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
0312330537|5.0|This is hands-down the best novel I've ever read.  Every word is pure mastery.  Every plot twist is pure genius.  I have never read anything like it.  Beautiful.  Perfect.  Precious.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|This movie is based on the best selling novel by john Ajvide Lindqvist. He also did the adaptation. Without spoiling the film, this is not the traditional vampire movie (like the Hammer Films with Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing). While there are traditional components (blood thirst, unnatural strength, fangs, inability to tolerate sunlight) it is definite not the typical tale. Interestingly it reminds audiences of one of the original parts of vampire folklore. Vampires can only come into a room when invited; hence the title. There is definite horror and gore here so it isn't some preteen girl goth version. In brief, Oskar, an outcast loner teen age boy lives a miserable life. One night a middle age man and a girl, Eli, moves into the apartment next door. Soon, Oskar forms a bond with Eli because of their shared isolation from society. Of course during all of this, various horrors are also occurring.    Is it THE GREATEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER? No, but it is very good. It is very Scandinavian movie, and has long shots where only a bleak setting is shown. Viewers who are used to the quick cut pacing of movies like Saw may find these moments tedious. The are some fantastic scenes. Without spoiling the film it handles the denouement in a brilliant understated way. Other scenes suffer from probably limitations of technique and cost. Several of the scenes in the book are set in dark and poorly lit settings which makes filming difficult. Some of the scenes therefore lose some tension because there are nice modern street lamps or walkway lighting in the background but probably the film makers had to do the best they could. It was filmed in a real settings and doesn't look like they could afford to build elaborate sets.    Is the book better? Yes and no. The book has many subplots and fills in a lot of details that are glossed over or ignored completely in the film. The sense of mood is also more strongly developed. The feeling of helplessness and hopelessness is much more clearly developed. The final confrontation however is handled in a very original and clever way and the last scene is an improvement on the book. So, try to see the movie and read the book.     Is there some theme or meaning? Yes, monsters are not born, but created; often spawned out of cruelty.    Will this film be remade for US audiences? Yes, reportedly (IMDB) the guy who did Cloverfield will be redoing this film and it will have Chloe Moretz (upcoming Diary of Wimpy Kid and Kick-Ass) as Eli.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|There are some films that deserve a five star review for reasons other that artistic success on every level; HACHI; A DOG'S TALE is one of those, for despite some minor technical problems with the film (the sound editing seems absent as the music - a fine score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental until it becomes clear that this is 'a dog's tale' and dogs see in black and white!), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers.  Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both  Kaneto Shindô and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m.<br /><br />The story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale).  The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen).  But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs.<br /><br />And that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal.  It is a little film to treasure.  Grady Harp, March 10rch 10

0385737424|5.0|What a wonderful novel! Miranda is a bona fide latch key kid who gets to walk home from school with her best friend Sal in 1978 New York City. One day, Sal is hit by a bigger kid on the way home and after that, he doesn't want to be friends anymore. Miranda is confusued, but the puzzle continues when she begins receiving anonymous notes. With nods to A Wrinkle in Time and the old gameshow, The 20,000 pyramid, Stead provides a cohesive narrative that had me paging back to check on previous chapters and wanting to read it again after I raced to the finish.

B00275EGWY|3.0|I've grown accustomed to being disappointed in the wins for best picture at the Oscars over the last few years. It seems those who make the decisions are so dead set on being taken seriously as artists that they fail to choose films that are popular as well as artistic, going for the dramatic punch that they feel shows how serious they are. When you discount one aspect of a film in an attempt to look at another, you lose perspective of the whole meaning of the award. I always looked at the Oscar as rewarding the best and the brightest. It seems that stopped a few years back and continues to do so this year with THE HURT LOCKER.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The movie is a good look at the world our military goes through on a day to day basis in war torn countries, this one being Iraq. But with all the movies I saw this past year, this was not the one that I though came near being the best. And Kathryn Bigelow has long deserved notice in Hollywood. Her work in the past was ignored and the making of this film wasn't done by a major Hollywood studio. That shows how much they truly respect her. The nicest thing about it is that she will now have enough clout to get more of her movies off the ground.<br /><br />So the story. The film opens with a group of soldiers in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their job is to dismantle, disarm or explode any bombs that are found in the area they are stationed in. The weapons of choice they most often come into contact with are Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and they have one here. As they attempt to prevent the bomb from exploding, an insurgent with a cell phone explodes it, killing the group's leader.<br /><br />The film moves on to the new leader of the group, the new bomb expert Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), one of the remaining soldiers, welcomes James to Camp Victory which was Camp Liberty but they decided this sounded better. In his quarters, James has taken off the boards covering the windows to let light in. When Sanborn points out they were installed to keep mortar fire from coming through, James points out that the mortars could easily come in through the roof and he prefers the light. As the film progresses, this becomes a telling moment into the psychological state of mind of James.<br /><br />With only 38 days left of service, the team is sent out to do their job in the city. Completing the group is Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), also witness to the first death. As they arrive at locations throughout the film to disarm bombs, the cautious Sanborn and Eldridge are perplexed by James willingness to confront danger head on. His unwillingness to follow protocol or to listen to Sanborn leads to a confrontation as well as several hair raising sequences where they set out to save lives by taking the bombs out.<br /><br />The differences in these men are what make up the meat of the film. Sanborn wants to follow orders and wants to survive, yet he doesn't see that in James. Eldridge is the most apparently mentally disturbed of the trio, talking with the camp psychiatrist as he deals with the death that surrounds him. But it is James that is the most frightening of the group, living without fear of death, taking apart bombs as if there's nothing more thrilling to do, trying to find solutions to each one he comes across.<br /><br />James character is so in tune with his love of danger that he keeps a box of bomb parts and detonators under his bed. It is James' story that is the focus of the film. He has become so involved in his position that he seeks out danger, that adrenaline rush that comes with it. The problem is that at the same time he puts his men in harm's way as well.<br /><br />While the trio evolve into a sense of camaraderie, they also begin to come apart in thanks to James' need for the rush. With days counting down as the story moves forward, the tensions mount.<br /><br />Sound like a good movie? Well,it sort of is. But at the same time the tenseness of the situations these men find themselves in is played out in a semi-real time mode. The viewer is required to sit and painstakingly wait as the clock ticks by while bombs are taken out.<br /><br />While each actor and character are played well, the main focus on James by Renner is exceptional. A young actor just getting notice, Renner portrays a complex series of emotions in James, from the thrill junkie to the tender hearted man who weeps at the sight of a young boy he got to know who appears to be murdered with a bomb planted inside of him later on.<br /><br />The film confronts some tough issues concerning war and the world we face in Iraq. But the best thing that it does is not take a major stand on the issues. It doesn't go right or left politically but tells the tale of the men in uniform straight on.<br /><br />So why didn't I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture? Because it was long and drawn out, it moved at a snails pace and it didn't entertain me. Yes, it was well made (with the exception of the hand held jostling camera that seems to have become a favorite lately) and yes it told a compelling story. But I never felt involved, never invested in the characters enough to get into the film.<br /><br />I know, many people will take exception with my views as to this not being deserving of the award. But when did we decide that gritty, hard tempered films were the only ones deserving? When did films that contained hope become the black sheep? When did movies that made us laugh or sing suddenly become unworthy?<br /><br />I am a firm believer that most people go to movies to escape the world they live in, to get away from the moments of pain, poverty, anger and down right meanness they are exposed to daily. Those are the movies that inspire and give hope. They deserve to be rewarded. And yet Hollywood continues to choose message films instead. It is because of this that I can't say this movie deserves the award.<br /><br />As for a viewing, I'm not even sure I can recommend it for that either. It is tedious at worst and contains fine performances at best. The only way to choose viewing this is making the choice on your own, knowing inside what it is you expect from a film, what you want from one. I know I couldn't sit through this one again, not due to the content but due to the slowness of it.ations these men find themselves in is played out in a semi-real time mode.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|By far the best in conteporary science fiction.  Herbert has created a world far greater than any other author in his field.  A must read for all.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Walter White's (Bryan Cranston) life is not what he expected nor wanted. A mild mannered high school chemistry teacher, he just turns 50 as the show starts. His wife is expecting another child, his first some is a well adjusted 16 year old with cp and life for Walter is just, well boring.<br /><br />Walter's job doesn't hold the glamour for him that it did when he began. After years of teaching (or at least trying to teach) kids chemistry and trying to pass along his passion for this knowledge, he now faces a generation that more so than the rest just doesn't care or take an interest. His second job working at a car wash results in an extra income but more degradation as the owner routinely disrespects him and has him do menial jobs.<br /><br />The worst finally comes around when Walter collapses at the car wash and is rushed to the hospital. Not informing his family, Walter is told by the doctors there that he has terminal, inoperable lung cancer. Where does one go when their entire world collapses around them?<br /><br />For Walter it comes in the form of his brother-in-law, a tough talking jovial DEA agent named Hank (Dean Norris). Cajoled by Hank time and again, he takes him up on his offer to go on a ride along when then next meth lab bust takes place. There is method to Walter's madness here. He wants to get a glimpse of the set up being used with plans of making meth on his own to sell and make a fortune that he can then leave his family. Fate steps in as Walter sees a young man escape from the house next door and recognizes him as Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), an ex-student of his.<br /><br />Walter tracks down Jesse and offers him a proposition. He wants to be the chemist involved in making the meth that Jesse would then in turn distribute. A straight business deal that would yield them both a nice wad of cash. To do so they need a place to cook and with the DEA seeking out houses being used, Walter comes up with a plan. A Winnebago, a meth lab on wheels.<br /><br />They get set up, make their first batch and Jesse is stunned by the purity of the product. Walter gets in a poke at Jesse concerning his ability to listen and learn, something he didn't seem to do in high school. Had he done so in chemistry class, he would have learned the tools he needed to become a major drug provider.<br /><br />So here we have the set up. This is a true anti-hero if there ever was one. A mild mannered suburbanite turned into a major drug dealer? Yes this is the basis for the series. But don't misunderstand. It doesn't glorify the drug culture or Walter's decision to create drugs. The story more involves Walter's attempt to do a good deed in providing for his family but at the same time making decisions that place himself and them in jeopardy. It's more about living with your wrong decisions and watching as Walter and Jesse attempt to save themselves from the decisions they made.<br /><br />As the series progresses (only 7 episodes) we watch as Walter comes to life. Perhaps it's the sense of danger, perhaps the fact that he is living outside of his comfort zone or perhaps it's that he is facing death by cancer that has made Walter change. We see him move from mild mannered chemistry teacher to a man willing to walk into the home base of a wild and jacked up drug dealer to demand respect and money.<br /><br />But the series isn't just about that. It's also about his wife and her love of her husband as she tries to understand his change, not knowing until halfway through the series that he has cancer. It's about his son dealing not only with his own problems but with a father he loves but hasn't quite learned to respect. It's about a man driven so far to the edge that he gets involved with drug manufacturing even though his brother-in-law is a DEA agent. It's about a man who when faced with what he feels are no options, turns to the darkest part of his soul. It's about life as we probably all wish we never have to experience.<br /><br />Theseries is not just a hard edged drama though. Throughout the escapades of Walter and Jesse we get plenty of actual laughs. Whether it's Walter standing in the middle of a road in his tighty whiteys with a gun he doesn't know how to use or Walter grabbing his wife's thigh in the midst of a PTA meeting, there are some truly funny moments.<br /><br />When I first heard of this show it didn't interest me, it didn't sound like something I'd like. The more I watched it on DVD though, the more invested in these characters I became. I liked Walter but not what he did. I felt for Jesse but wished he seek treatment. And I hoped that this family would find a way to survive everything that happened to them.<br /><br />It might not be the cup of tea that the average renter would enjoy. But the dark humor, the danger and the interest in the main character make this compelling viewing as it progresses. Cranston and Paul do a fantastic job as an odd couple for the current state of affairs. And once the series ends, you find yourself looking forward to season two (coming out on DVD soon as well as season 3 starting on AMC in March 2010).<br /><br />One thing that has to be mentioned again about this series. It's the story of a man who produces crystal meth. It would be easy to write the series off as an homage to meth dealers and manufacturers. But that isn't at its root what the story is about. It's about a man who makes the wrong decisions for the right reasons and then has to face the consequences. Movie makers have made films about bad guys doing bad things for years and yet we've found ourselves both enjoying the films and rooting at times for the bad guys (think BONNIE AND CLYE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and possibly even Hannibal Lecter when he snacked on characters we learned to hate).<br /><br />My biggest fear with this series is that it will become the norm. With series like WEEDS where a recently widowed mother becomes a major marijuana dealer or DEXTER where a serial killer becomes a hero for killing bad guys and other serial killers, a trend seems to be starting. And with Hollywood being a place that loves to imitate or repeat past successes with poor quality knock offs, this could turn out to be just the first of many shows like this. Let's just hope that they know it's good and don't move forward with plans on shows about loveable hit men, goofy corrupt politicians or silly next door neighbor pedophiles.s of Walter and Jesse we get plenty of actual laughs.

0425129616|5.0|I have read many Agatha Christie novels since I was a teenager, there is something charming and intelligent and witty about them, with this novel I finally got to read the one that started it all. Book one was actually quite good, I was entranced the whole time I was reading it, the story appears to be quite simple and the obvious is suddenly questioned, the suspect count rises and the real murderer slithers unnoticed, that is until the little Belgian super hero, Hercule Poirot gets involved.  Invited by his friend Hastings, he's joined at the great mansion at the Styles Court where Emily Inglethorp runs the house, along with her new husband and her friends and relatives she lives of the riches her deceased husband has left her. On what seems a random evening she suffers horribly and ends up dead, with her current will in question and some strange things happening between the quests and the family members, there is sudden distrust of some of the members, but those who seem guilty and those are actually guilty are two different things, it's up to Poirot to stretch his little legs and big brain and get to the bottom of things. There is greed and jealousy and hidden feelings that surface only to explode in everyone's face, the fun has began!    The book was a lot of fun, not only is it a fast and captivating read, it makes the reader think quite a bit. I took my time reading it and loosely going over the clues in my head. Upon reading the ending I was off in my decision of the guilty suspect but never the less I loved the ending and the final explanation, some clues might not be as crystal clear as others but there are many of them; reading is fun when the field is wide, not when it's thin and obstructed by lack of ideas and this novel certainly had me guessing all over the place. Agatha Christie is one of my favorite authors because every time I read her books I feel a jolt of joy, I get so much out of them  and nothing written in these days will ever compare, so to me they are relics from the past that shine even brighter than many brand new books written these days. The mystery is fun but the whole feel of this book is even better, the old fashioned ideas and culture adds something whimsical to all of her works. Every time I pick up a Hercule Poirot novel I know I will have a nice time, so far I haven't been disappointed as I have read them half my life and will continue to do so. Currently I had to start book number two in the series, I am on such a happy high from the first one that my thirst for mystery hasn't been quenched yet, so I'm off to read \\"Murder on the links\\" and see where the adventure takes me, from what  I head it's Paris and the crime is quite good..    - Kasia S.

0061876747|4.0|The difference between Boyd's thriller and those of others who write in this genre is the depth of the supporting characters. Too many best sellers are totally plot driven. Often the supporting characters are indistinguishable and the main character is generalized. That is not the case with Boyd. Oh, and did I mention I actually had to use the dictionary one or twice while reading this novel!
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I have spent my life in broadcasting, sound and video.  I have used every conceivable mic you can name and several you likely never heard of.  I have a fairly extensive collection of mics ranging from super cheepies from the old Lafayette Radio of the 1960's to the latest and greatest pro studio PR-30 from the genius of Bob Heil at Heil Sound.      That said, for pure dollar value vs. sound quality, the Behringer XM-8500 is a steal.  It sounds every bit as good as similar mics selling at five times the price and is just as rugged.      Its only drawback is its propensity to be a little sibilant if worked straight on, very close without a wind screen.  Put a $2 wind-screen on it and all that disappears and its the match of mics in the $100+ category. (Rule of thumb taught to me back when I was first getting started in radio:  Never use this design of mic without a wind screen -- no matter what brand it is.)      I own several of XM-8500's and use them mainly for loan outs to friends who want to do a recording with something that sounds better than the mic built into their digital or tape recorder.  I also have a dedicated pair that I use to do field interviews for an on-line news service I produce -- recording these days on a Zoom H4 digital recorder.  Nobody who has borrowed one of my XM-8500's has ever complained.  Nobody Ive ever interviewed has sounded anything but natural.      No, its not going to be the equal of an EV RE-20 or my Heil PR-30, but for $20, I dare you to find anything that sounds better or is constructed better than the Behringer XM-8500.

B002M9WW30|4.0|I thought the transfer on Rocky was just awful! I liked the vivid colors but their is entirely too much film grain on the first movie. It was like I was watching a really old film canister. Rocky II was better but still quite old looking retaining its film grain. Rocky III was similar but still better looking than Rocky. Rocky IV looked amazingly good considering how old the movie is. This was the best looking of the older films. Rocky V looked similar to II and III but still decent for its age. Rocky Balboa looked awesome!!! The Transfer was really solid especially when he was in the ring with Mason Dixon. Finally, the packaging fox gives you is really crappy. The hubs barely hold onto the movies. Very flimsy design for a collector's edition. Luckily blu-ray has a really tough scratch resistant coating. Boo for Fox/MGM selling this with a horrible packaging design flaw!!!!!

This books if full of useful tips for developing in Java and also provides as a decent introduction to java.util.collections and java.util.concurrent.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I think if Michael had not died this would have been his best concert to date! Everything would have been bigger and better than his older concerts. Michael's brothers said you only saw 60% of Michael here because he was trying to make sure everyone knew what they were supposed to do but if Michael had actually done the concert you would have seen the 200% he always gave for all of his concerts, and I could see that during the rehersals. The musicians, dancers, and singers were excellent!
B0007P0LO8|1.0|While the voices are fine, the production values are very disappointing.  The video is poor and the audio is poor.  The overall direction approach doesn't work.  I'd much rather see a video of a stage production.  After  several emails to the seller, Moviemars, I received no satisfaction on return or substitution.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This was the best movie I saw last year. It was magnificent! The cast was fablous! They should have got some kind of award.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|The first 20 minutes were ok, but then this movie absolutely fell apart. Director must have had severe ADD and lost track of just about everything, and quickly ran out of any coherent ideas. This movie got so bad it made me mad!
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Barring the emergence of some unknown auteur who was able to organize the filming of every moment of the experience from a hundred different angles, then brilliantly organize the result into a never boring thirty hour film, this is probably the best we are going to get by way of a visualization of the event which has reached mythic dimensions, The Woodstock Myth. With brevity, it is the story of how young people from all over the country came together for three days, peaceably assembled , existing as a self-sufficient commune, practicing the ways of the new counter-culture, together with like-minded and supportive musicians, to show the world that The Good, The True and The Beautiful could be made actual even in the brutal, repressive, exploitative world to which the counterculture was a challenge. Much supportive evidence is manifest in the photographed behavior and interviews with participants, as well residents, of nearby Woodstock and environs.  I would venture another interpretation that would, I believe, provide a more solid cognitive foundation for understanding what went on in these three days (in addition to much fine music, not including the efforts of a Woodstock resident who fled his home in the area to avoid the event (Bob Dylan). What I see in this film, suggested not clearly and forcefully exposed, is a large group of mostly middle class young people coming together to do their thing while wrapped in a cocoon of army, law-enforcement agencies, local and area \\"civilians\\" and a whole panoply of efforts by the \\"older folk\\", despite not understanding that \\"the times they are a-changing\\". What do I mean....briefly:  All normal laws applicable to their drug possession and use were suspended, all local ordinances regarding public behavior and dress and health facilities were suspended, major life saving medical assistance was provided by the military and other branches of government, public officials and charitable local citizens provided most of the food which they ate, property laws later enforced rigorously at Rock Festivals (a price for admission, respect for the property of the surrounding area and of the promoters) were suspended, including, at an anticipated heavy financial loss to promoters,  allowing non-paying individuals to tear down the peripheral fences so as to attend free of charge, when others had purchased tickets. Traffic direction on a very expensive scale and many other routines of life were carried on at no financial cost or burden to participants. Finally, but sufficient unto this report, there are the pictures and interviews suggesting (though inadequate to do more than create a hypothesis for further testing) that Daddy and Mommy stood ready, whatever the circumstances in which their \\"kids\\" found themselves, once more to embrace them and support them financially and, perhaps emotionally, to whatever extent needed.  Further research, if possible, would show the later cost to life and limb, and human happiness, of the kind of behavior to which they were allowed full rein at Woodstock. Of those performing, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix are shocking examples of the cost of the road once taken, performers paid an enormous personal price of which we are probably not fully aware. For the audience, anecdotal evidence exists in what one knows personally about some participants; the full cost in physical, mental and social terms, will probably never be known.  On the other hand, the social interaction, the sex, the drugs, the contagion of crowd impulses, and the music with often charismatic performers, certainly provided many with some relief from the desperate fear of the men, generated by the risk they faced of having to engage in the dreadful experience of military conflict, relief also was provided both male and female, to the angst of youth and the knowledge they possessed that, despite the enormous wealth with which they were surrounded, social inequities and dehumanization occurring throughout theworld.  Certainly, this documentary can be recommended highly despite the brief sampling from each of the musician's sets.   Just how one may interpret the myth so eagerly propagated by participants as manifest in the film, is a matter for each viewer to judge. There will be many, of course, who seek only to hear the music; there is plenty of that although not as much as one would like.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|Movies about aliens on earth have been popular going back to the black & white days, so it is really hard to come up with something new and original.  There have been several that were noteworthy.  Maybe the first was the original War of the Worlds, followed by The Day the Earth Stood Still, in which we encounter the god-like aliens who come not to destroy, enslave or uplift mankind, but to discipline us.  Spielberg released the next two milestones.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was probably the first movie to really explore how individuals, communities, and governments would react to the appearance of UFO's.  E.T. personalized the encounter and put a friendly, if not humanoid face on the otherwordly visitors.  Both movies also featured the most memorable soundtracks of alien movies.  After this, special effects and CGI become widespread and Hollywood is annually producing at least one expensive, though not always profitable, movie about aliens landing on earth.  Examples include Independence Day, Starship Troopers, X-files, Starman, Predator, Superman (remember, he is from Krypton), etc..  However, after E.T., none of them has ever earned a major nomination from the Acadamy Awards until District 9.      Produced as an indie film, and set in South Africa of all places, District 9 is probably the best alien invasion movie this decade.  All the norms of alien films are turned upside down; the aliens are technologically advanced, but not advanced enough to keep themselves out a slum.  And instead of having smooth skins with nice uni-color suits; they look like prawns.  And they love catfood.  And instead of coming to Earth as visitors, conquerors or predators, they got stuck here, either lost or as refugees.  This is the backstory of District 9.  The main plot is about a bureaucrat who is accidentally exposed to some sort of biowarfare agent, and begins to transform into an alien.  As this occurs, he is hunted down by humans who want his body for various reasons.This movie is superficially a sci-fi action flick, but it also has scenes of tragedy, comedy, suspense, and drama.  In short, it is a complete movie that explores the human condition in many aspects.  I however did not think it deserved a best picture nomination from the Acadamy Awards as there were too many plot holes in it.  Many of these are highlighted in other reviews for this movie, so I will list the most visible ones.  First of, why isn't the area below the spaceship evacuated?  Second, the aliens clearly own superior technology in terms of military hardware.  Why don't they use this hardware to free themselves from their slum?  Third, how did Wikus and his alien friend, Christopher, manage to escape District 9 and navigate to the MNU corporate headquarters without anyone noticing them?  Fourth, why did Wikus not see a doctor after being exposed to the black liquid.  He knows he is sick, especially after his fingernails start coming of.      So overall a good movie, but not a great one.  But as an indie movie, it was probably the best indie movie of 2009.  For its low budget, the special effects, cinematography, set design, costume design, basically everything technical, is spot on and up to par with any big budget Hollywood flick.  This is telling, and highlights how expensive big name actors and actresses are, and how their salaries tend to comprise the biggest chunk of big movie costs.  Worth the watch, and buying this DVD.
