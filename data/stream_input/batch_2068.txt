0297859382|1.0|The characters are tricky liars who are self absorbed and ugly to each other.  The author went to a lot of creative trouble to tell an unpleasant story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a very nice sequel to the original game. It has beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay. The only thing about this game is that when I attempt to use a green gem to save my character, the game freezes for a second and then returns to my homescreen on my Kindle Fire. This happens about 50% of the time. I'm not sure if it is the games or the Kindle's problem, but otherwise I recommend that you get this game. It is a lot of fun!(Other than the glitchy part)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Made me remember why I fell in love with my husband 25 years ago. I have  successful changed  him.Now  I want him back.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers! Everyone in our family enjoys it. From my four year old nephew to my sixty something mom they all have fun. If you like temple run you will like this game. And you can spend real money but you can earn everything you want by playing so it isn't necessary.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Great story of Australia in WWII era.  Historical context spot on.  Acting excellent.  I've watched it 17 times!  Story brings several themes together nicely.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game and very addictive. My son got me addicted to this game. The graphics are really good and it responds easy to your touch. This game is definitely one to own.
B00992CF6W|1.0|you want to know why? I used to love this game until everything that I built on my 3 worlds were gone. The only stuff I had was what was In my inventory.

B006YM9JSW|4.0|The product is excelent,  but.... the four stars rate is because the box must be a little stronger. In my particular case the box came damaged. First i was worry but the processor wasn't harmed. Thanks.
0439023521|5.0|I've enjoyed watching Jennifer Lawrence from Louisville, as main character in the film.  Read the trilogy, looking forward to all the movies too.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story of two flyers, who had respect for each other.  Each a hero .  Unbelievable that they would meet years later and share their feelings.

B00AGKHFCA|3.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />I have to keep reminding myself that Amazon customer review star ratings are meant to express how much the customer reviewer LIKED something, not how good it may or may not be from an objective, critical point of view.  Regardless, it is often easy to get objective and subjective opinions about the arts confused - and is there really any such thing as a truly subjective opinion about art anyway?  Whatever...<br /><br />That being said although the system considers a three star review from me a \\"negative\\" review, I consider it a mildly positive review.  Three stars is supposed to mean \\"it's okay\\" and if it's \\"okay\\" then it's not bad...it's just not as good as it could be, which might be both a subjectively and objectively accurate statement about this album.  This album is not as good as it could be.<br /><br />Despite all the ways in which I could discuss this music, the fact is when I heard \\"Perfidia,\\" \\"Era gi&agrave; tutto previsto,\\" and especially \\"La Vie en Rose,\\" I felt something in my bones, and when I heard the rest of the songs on PASSIONE I did not.  That's not to say the other songs are bad, they just didn't move me.<br /><br />The problem for me is this all feels very posed and generic.  Most of the music, the album cover, and even the album title remind me of a CD one might find on one of those listening stations in a Target or in a mom and pop gift shop that cells ceramic figurines.  You know, those listening stations without headphones where you press a button to hear Spanish guitar music, rainforest sounds, or something by Jim Brickman.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with Jennifer Lopez, but she's not the greatest singer to be singing with a great singer.  Nothing wrong with Neil Diamond, but his song \\"September Morn\\" just doesn't belong here.  Nothing wrong with PASSIONE, but it's not the greatest album - unless maybe you're eating at The Olive Garden -  but otherwise it's just ok.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listenertener
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is the best game ever that is what I think. I would recommend getting this game.This game is awesome.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|I enjoyed Borat. This movie was pretty weak in comparison. lots of sexist and racist jokes throughout the whole thing, which I was kind of expecting, but really not that funny.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|To all the other cam apps. O misty need to Ifogure put what I did to other pix . Help
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really really love this bible. I put my headphones on and listen and read at the same time or just listen if I am to busy to read
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This is a very interesting and insightful read. It does not tell you how to fix habits, but rather tells why we have them and how to recognize them. The author does a great job describing the habit loop and its role not only in an individuals life, but also in the life's of business' and industries. Once you are able to pin-point the bad habits of your life and what cue's these habits, you are able to replace the habit with a new one. This book definitely helped me in my personal life  to identify habits and make positive changes.
0345522478|4.0|To any human, Atticus looks like a tattooed, Irish twenty-one-year old. In reality, Atticus O'Sullivan is closer to twenty-one centuries old. He's the last of the Druids, and when he is not shape-shifting in his spare time with his Irish wolfhound, he's running an occult bookshop in the middle of Arizona. Unfortunately, an angry Celtic god wants Atticus' magical sword that he \\"acquired\\" a few centuries back, and will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. With the help of lawyer vampires, ghouls, witches, and Irish luck, Atticus prepares to kick some ass (and save his in the process).<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this novel, but I really enjoyed Atticus. He is a mixture of modern and old language (an old soul in a young body), and can be a witty smart-ass. What threw me off is that he is not like one of the usual protagonists you see in other urban fantasy novels. Atticus knows when to shut up, and he isn't full of bravado. The magical elements of Hounded aren't new to the market by any means, but Hearne writes these elements well. And there really isn't a romance in the book, which I actually enjoyed. All the main characters are fleshed out, even the Irish wolfhound (adore!), but some of the secondary characters were a bit sketchy, and I wish I knew more about them when the big showdown came.<br /><br />The main focus of the story in this book was mainly the Celtic mythology, but other stories from different cultures were also touched base upon. Hearne did not limit himself to just one \\"world\\" so to speak. It's literally a mythology-lover's wet dream. The plot moved along nicely, and I found myself genuinely curious on what the end result would be. My only criticism is that sometimes the humor made the writing uneven - I felt like the novel was trying too hard to have a comedic effect.<br /><br />I definitely will be reading the next few books of this series when I get my hands on them. This is not a \\"oh my gosh! I need the next book now,\\" sort of series, but it is one you'll find yourself reading because Atticus is such an interesting character.<br /><br />This review is posted in full on my blog (check out via profile link), and I received this copy of \\"Hounded\\" from NetGalley. All opinions are my own.t of series, but it is one you'll find yourself reading because Atticus is such an interesting character.<br /><br />This review is posted in full on my blog (check out via profile link), and I received this copy of \\"Hounded\\" from NetGalley. All opinions are my own.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I am now 68 and had never read this book , had  seen the movie.  I must say I really enjoyed the book more as in one's mind you see the story come to life.  It is a book I will read again only than it will be with our granddaughters.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Just had to say this was a great game had a fun time. Both my husband and son tried to take over while I was playing the game.Next time I'll play when they're not home.

B004HD61KE|2.0|Book based on Mormon beliefs. Mormons who like action novels would probably enjoy this. Otherwise, not so much. Don't get fooled. Mormons begin with truth and then redefine the words. Beware.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|a great read. I liked the twist and turns, it will keep you reading till the end.  Can't put in down.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Great Watch. It keeps really good time and the second sweep hand has a red tip, so it's really easy to see when you're at the gym and resting between sets.
076781326X|5.0|Saw the movie when it was first released, and remembered how much<br />I liked it then.  It is a pleasure to be able to show this to my grandson,<br />the way I showed it to his Dad, many years ago.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|Excellent and moving portrayal of a middle aged woman and her family coping with the progression of<br />Alzheimer's Disease. Gave this reader a much better understanding of the challenges for both the patient and the family.
0321544080|3.0|I've been a little frustrated after reading this book. After the rave reviews I read, I expected much more. Yes, you will learn things by reading the book. But if you don't own a Nikon system, you will miss many of the opportunities the book presents.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've enjoyed using this neat little app. It's really helped me with keeping myself in check on my to-do' s across all of my devices. I recommend it to anyone that regularly uses their phone, and at least one tablet. The audio dictation' s a cool feature too.<br /><br />My only gripe is the account the, and pw setup and restore features are a bit lacking.<br /><br />But besides that, it's a solid app. I've come to rely on it in my daily routine. Lol.
B005SAZFWK|3.0|I really like British humor so I thought this would be right up my alley.  It was a little funny in some parts but less than I expected.  Overall a decent movie to watch to pass the time.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|don't care for this type of novel. would not say &#34;hate it&#34; just not my cup of tea. prefer thinking stimulation material
0345803485|1.0|Although the writer was well written albiet very explicit with the sex parts... there really was no content to the book.  I regret the time I spent reading it hoping that real plot would emerge.  I would give no stars if possible.  I do not recommend this book to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its very fun yet some of the tasks take forever to completed but worth it in the long run I love beauty
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Veryy awsome i luv it it is the best thing i played and my sister loves shes 16 im 12
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game! cant stop! it keeps me entertained!  so real looking! I wish it was easier to get blue enegry bolts!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I decided I wanted this cd after watching the movie.  There are a few songs I don't care for(which I already knew) but I just forward over them.  It was in like new condition and I received it in the time frame promised.  Overall very satisfied.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this game.  Great graphics,great controls.  Looks really beautiful on m y Kindle Fire HD. My only complaint is its so tied to Facebook.I dont do Facebook, so I cant get past one of the challenges that requires I beat a friend on Facebook.  Oh, well.  Other than that I really enjoy this g a m e.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think they really improved on the graphics, gameplay, and unlockables from TR1. Get occasional lag spikes though, which sometimes causes unresponsive controls (and then, of course, death).
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game but I don't like how there are shadows. But other than that I love this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most entertaining app I've ever seen.So much to unlock and its never tiring. I love that it has so many different scenes as well. Definitely get this app. It won't steer you in the wrong direction.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This violence/story was just a reminder of how terrible slavery was for all, including the slave owners.  It was an inhumane time and institution, and of course, Tarantino, Fox, Decaprio, Waltz, et.al, bring it right to an ugly head. Thank goodness there was a little humor involved - it was a long movie to sit on the edge of your seat, and want to get up and bash Decaprio (what a great actor). \\"Hey Doc, I would have shot him for you!\\" I saw the movie as part documentary, part spaghetti western, terrific special effects, retribution and revenge, humor, mishmash, all thrown together as entertainment. It was a definite, unique movie, not to be forgotten.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very interesting and informative read..When you look at the health problems of our society this book connects the dots. Everyone should read this book!
141690977X|4.0|[[ASIN:B002JLDWNU He's Just NOT That Into You]]<br /><br />Hey Ladies,<br />Sometimes the cliché \\"It's not you it's me\\" is just a quick & lazy way of saying \\"You like me too much to realise this but I'm actually a total loser who's been working in an IT call centre for 5 years with absolutely no prospect or plan for promotion and I'm about a month a away from getting fired because I've been doing the same meaningless job for so long that I've actually lost the capacity to care about it or anything else.  The only reason I asked you out was because you're a friend of my sister who you told you like me and my whole family have been badgering me to ask you out because they 1. want grandchildren and 2. also don't realise what a pathetic waste of space I am.  Seriously, you picked a losing horse with me sweetheart and your better off with just about anyone else who isn't an alcoholic or a criminal.\\"<br /><br />So when a guy tells you the aforementioned cliché maybe it is a shallow brush off or maybe just maybe it really refers to the big long speel about why you should forget about this guy completely.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thought that it was a great game! Everything was great, but there was one thing I didn't like... The picture of the man in the top left corner with all the objectives was kinda creepy and tacky, but everything else was great!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Spent $2.99 for this app last night.  My son is done with it the next day and gets to another level and says you have to pay $1.99 more to play it?  That is very misleading.  When you buy the app it should be the entire game.  I've paid .99 for apps on other devices and got more content than that.  For $3 you really should get more than an hour of play time. This is ridiculous.  That is the last time I actually pay for an angry birds app.  My son can get it if it is free other than that forget it he can find another game that isn't a rip off!!!
B00005B1W7|5.0|I just wish that there were more television series like this one.  It had a great cast of very talented people.  It got us through a few cold New Hampshire winter evenings!
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love this cover. It makes this look like a classical book. Keeps the scratches off. I highly recommend this as a gift.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|In the beginning I wasn't sure I wanted to continue reading, but then it pulled me in, and, from that point on I couldn't stop reading it.  When I finished, I wanted more.  The book was simply captivating.  This is one of the best books I have read in a year!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't see that plot comming. It's a very weel written book about something that really needst to be talked about but for some reason still isn't. Don't wanna spoil it by telling what the matter is.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|First of all this game is in many ways superior to the original. However, it does have a few issues that make the gameplay less enjoyable and at times downright frustrating. The game has a tendancy to crash, especially when attempting to use a &quot;save me&quot; which I only tend to do during big, or objective obtaining, runs. Needless to say then, this is an unfortunate time for crashes to take place. Additionally, this game seems to have far more unavoidable deaths than the previous game. It seems that obstacles are quite frequently placed rout next to each other so that even the best timed jump wont clear them both. This makes successful run very much a matter of luck, I prefer games that depend on my &quot;skill&quot; (if playing temple run can be considered a skill)
B00B19DMUE|3.0|not my type of movie, it was my fault to pick it up. a waste of my time. Irene Michalek
B005K17RU0|4.0|Does the job, wish they hadn't changed some stuff with the updates. Better way to view the daily forecast would be appreciated
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Really fun game I play it all the time!!! So addicting and awesome!!! My best friend and I play it all the time against each other!!! Must have app for any phones, tablets or anything else in general!! IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This one of the best books I have read in sometime. The concept for this book is extremely interesting and as someone who has worked underground for a living I could relate to many of the situations the characters found themselves in. I also like the fact that the author is selling his books as an independent.
B0073ODRKG|5.0|Amazing collection of the Queen with beauty presentation and memory of her success I❤MDNA. The sound cuality is the best and OK
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was such a great read. I would definitely recommend this book, you won't be able to put it down until you finish!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Whatever album she makes, she turns into gold. She's amazing! I don't have 10 more words to say. You shouldn't put a limit on what one can and cannot say!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|There is nothing worse when buying a CD to find you love 1-3 songs but the rest of the tracks are ho-hum or worse. I love watching the Piano Guys videos and listening to the CD is just as great, and every single track is fabulous. My only suggestion- put out more CDs!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I haven't been able to stop playing it!  For all you action game lover's, this is definitely a \\"must have\\"'!  GET IT!
B003K16P3M|5.0|This is easily the beat book i'v ever read. Bitterblue is great, too many characters from graceling are in bitterblue.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg this game is SO much better than the first! you get to do so many other tthings! I'm addicted! I recommend to everyone!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun game! It's like having a real horse :). The graphics are amazing. Sound quality is excellent! Great fun app!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|When Doctor Who was brought back after it's long hiatus I was excited because the original Doctors Who had been one of my favorite shows.  Each of the actors that portrayed the Doctor brought their own unique perspective but with Matt Smith's &#34;regeneration&#34; I was unsure.  Unsure why I didn't get caught up in the newest Doctor: was it the writers, or the story lines, or maybe the directors.  Now I've come to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter because I've begun to see how Matt Smith's Doctor is distinctly his own.  It's taken time and watching the episodes again to catch details but he's really growing on me.  No matter what happens with the Doctor's character after Matt Smith regenerates into the new Doctor I will miss him as Doctor Who.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It is ok. It freezes up at time. The graphic are good. It being free is good. That is really all I have to say on my review off this app.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is fun but after I play it once I have to reinstall the entire game and start over. besides that it's really fun
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I've been a big fan of the original story for a long time: Batman comes out of retirement after ten years to fight the dregs of society that have cropped up in his absence, not to mention a few old foes and a new commissioner who is definitely NOT a friend of the Bat.<br /><br />This movie, for the most part, delivers. The animation is awesome, the voice talents do the trick, and I like how they throw in the random news reports alongside the action. Very Watchmen-esque.<br /><br />One thing that was missing was a lot of the dialogue. Batman only says a fraction of the dialogue in the movie that was in the comic; hardly any thought-dialogue, and not much more out loud. To be fair, what dialogue there was is spot-on, and maybe too much dialogue would've made the movie exposition-heavy. Still, it would've been nice to hear more of the famous dialogue come to life.<br /><br />I give it a four out of five. Definitely get it.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|if you haven't played this game beware! this game scared the pee out if me! there is a crappy house at the very end of the map...(make sure you don't turn around at all costs)well the very last's page is in that stupid house and its REALLY hard to survive there.(even on easy difficulty)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It a very good game but it lages a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Fantastic movie that suffers from adapting an incomplete story in progress.<br /><br />Gorgeous visuals and animation. Music like nothing else. A must see for fans of anime and animation in general.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a great movie, my kids love it. I am supposed to write eleven more words.... Three to go.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|My daughter requested this for Christmas, and I'd like to see it again.  Its one of those movies that has so much going on, that you can probably notice something you missed when you watch it again.  Very unusual setup for a movie.

B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|Disney's \\"Peter Pan\\" is finally up for the high-definition treatment. One by one each of their classic movies are either being re-released in 3D before hitting Blu-ray or just going straight there. The beloved 1953 animated adaptation of J.M. Barrie's book was the last of Disney's films to be distributed through RKO Pictures. This fact gives it even more historical significance for cinema buffs. It's easily one of my favorite movies from the Mouse House because of its quick pace and borderline dark humor.<br /><br />Peter Pan returns to the nursery of Wendy, Michael, and John Darling after losing his shadow. He visits them frequently in secret to listen to Wendy's tales about himself and his adventures in Neverland. Peter accidentally wakes the children up and agrees to take them to Neverland with him. They soon get tangled up in a battle between with Captain Hook and his pirates. Joining them in their fight are the Lost Boys and the fairy Tinkerbell.<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan\\" has something for everyone. There's a girl yearning for adventure, an Indian princess, a beautiful sparkling fairy, and mermaids for the younger female audiences out there. Boys can get excited over pirates, Indians, and mischievous little troublemakers who like to fight with each other. Adults will enjoy it because of its humor and ability to take them back to a more innocent time when they weren't bogged down with so many grown-up responsibilities.<br /><br />It's funny to watch \\"Peter Pan\\" now in the politically correct environment we live in. It's a children's cartoon in which we witness Captain Hook shoot a pirate for singing too loud, Peter make rude comments about girls, a little boy smoke a peace pipe, and listen to Indians sing about \\"What Makes the Red Man Red.\\" Isn't it strange how what's acceptable changes over the years?<br /><br />The high-definition transfer for \\"Peter Pan\\" looks and sounds excellent. There will be those who take issue with the restoration process which removed much of the grainy look and smoothed everything out.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|I'm rating this film four stars because I highly enjoyed it.  Parts were a bit slow, but it was an overall good movie.  What really gave it that extra 'oomph' was that I researched the film afterwards, and I found that Clint Eastwood used SO MANY real details, including names, for the real story that inspired this movie.  That was very cool to me, seeing as how so many blockbusters these days that are \\"based on\\" true stories only lightly touch the true story.  So thank you, Eastwood, for taking this story to the big screen!
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Lots of action and some sentiment.  My son-in-law couldn't wait for this movie to come out, and he loves it.  I do think its better than the last batman series.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game keeps me occupied for long peiords of time--especially at night when tv stinks!<br />I think anyone who plays it will be hooked.
B009XTF8JM|4.0|I think I've seen it all now. Never in a million years did I anticipate it was possible to make a movie about demon possession and have it completely devoid of the utterance of the name of Jesus Christ or the symbolism of the cross. \\"The Possession\\" has accomplished both these tasks in the space of one film.<br /><br />To say this Jewish take on \\"The Exorcist\\" is unique would be both true and false at the same time. It's more of the same in the fact that it tramples the frequently treaded grounds explored by \\"The Last Exorcism,\\" \\"The Devil Inside,\\" \\"The Rite,\\" and countless others over the years. Where it's unique is in the fact that it explores the concept from the viewpoint of the Jewish faith instead of the usual Judeo-Christian one.<br /><br />In case you're not in the religious know, most Jews don't believe Jesus is the Son of God. Therefore, there's no name of Jesus or sign of the cross they can use to battle demonic forces. Although I don't share their beliefs, it's fascinating to explore the idea of possession and exorcism from a different angle.<br /><br />Clyde Brenek (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) takes his daughters to an estate sale on their way home one afternoon. The youngest one, Em (Natasha Calis), is captivated by an antique wooden box with bizarre writing on it. Clyde buys it for her and they take it home. Em becomes obsessed with the box, going as far as to sleep with it and take it to school with her.<br /><br />Clyde and ex-wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) become more and more concerned as Em's behavior becomes unpredictable and violent. Clyde takes the box to be examined and finds out that it is a container for an evil spirit known as a Dibbuk. Once the box is opened, it slowly and completely consumes the human it has bonded with. The two parents must get past their disbelief and find someone within the Jewish religious community who will step out in faith and help them.<br /><br />Director Ole Bornedal (\\"Nightwatch\\") is no stranger to the art of creating a suspenseful atmosphere in his films. \\"The Possession\\" also shows that he knows how to take what many would consider tired subject matter and breathe new life into it. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the movie doesn't have any flaws, but for the most part it's genuinely creepy and provides some frightening visuals.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"The Possession\\" to those horror fans tired of the same old boring take on territory \\"The Exorcist\\" explored in 1973. Although my own beliefs are Christian, I found the Jewish take on the concept of possession to be fascinating to examine. There might be many \\"d&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\" moments, but it's light years better than other exorcism movies we've been bombarded with recently. I'm looking at you, \\"The Last Exorcism\\" and \\"The Devil Inside!\\"g a suspenseful atmosphere in his films. \\"The Possession\\" also shows that he knows how to take what many would consider tired subject matter and breathe new life into it.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I chose this rating because I am in love with this show so much no matter what the season is. There is nothing I dislike about it.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|Unlike most Lynyard Skynyrd Albums, But well worth the listen… More Rock then Country, but all good in my book. God and Guns, Still Unbroken, Southern Ways, and That Ain’t My America are my four top favorites on this album. Everyone must buy or listen to this CD, it’s well worth the money…
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It kept my interest going through out the whole book. I think a lot of woman can relate to this story. Both thrilling and romantic. I would suggest anyone to read it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey- please don't ever go off the air. The best show ever made. When is season 4 coming? I can't wait!
B006OEPITO|5.0|Even if you have read this before, good to reread.  Good for all ages, and a really good classic to have read at any age
B003THHIEM|5.0|A few days before buying this tv show, I was flipping through the channels bored when I stumbled across TNT's Castle marathon. So I watched a few, took a chance on season 1 being good and was rewarded with a highly enjoyable show. Its funny and sweet and cute. I like it and its not very expensive compared to some tv show's seasons.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Buying a $1 book i was skeptical. And after researching before I bought I saw that the author wanted to the book to be free bu amazon wouldn't let him. After seeing his writing style online (read &#34;The Egg&#34;) and liking it, I did the $1 investment. I was not disappointed. A great story about a man left on mars and his struggle to stay alive. The best part of the book is the writing style. The first person is perfect for it. This book is a page turner. Some parts are so intense. The book is both Funny, and serious. The book is also a technical writing of sorts. The main character constantly describing everything he did so you can picture it like you are there. The last few pages definitely fizzle out but didn't leave me upset. I personally loved this book. Every character is great. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is into first person narratives, or science buffs or anyone looking for a great bargain because for $1 you get a 5 hour book that will make you quite angry no one has tried to turn this into a move. IT BETTER BECOME A MOVIE!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a book that makes you think about such lofty issues as oblivion and the impact your life and love has on the world. It is a beautiful story that plumes the deepest emotions of loss and love in a situation that involves the young and teaches the old.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Beautiful graphics, engaging storyline, not too difficult....just enough to be enjoyable.<br />Looking forward to a series of Enigmatis games. I would reccommend this to mystrry lovers and HOG or puzzle lovers!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool great colorful sightings that keep your attention! Plus its free. So we're can you get a better breath taking game.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|If you are a Bruno Mar's fan, you will LOVE this.  It has a variety of styles but you can understand the lyrics.  I love this.  He is so talented,
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved the book. It was fast and it was action pack. You felt like that you were part of the missaion. I would recommend it highly.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|First, I must mention, that, our education system is flawed in many ways; how can we expect our young population to be better citizens in the future if they don't learn from the past failures.<br /><br />What a captivating story,there are moments I must admit, where it is very difficult to accept the treatment that people were put through....if we humans don't learn how accept our differences we will not have this beautiful planet for long.<br /><br />J F. Bigras
0765325950|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Given the twists and turns in this very lengthy series, the task of wrapping up  the loose threads in this ending must have been daunting. I thought the resolution of the fight for the world on a cosmic scale between Rand and the Dark One was nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />What drew me to Jordan's world and kept me reading even through the less climatic books were the different cultures, the characters and the relationships between those characters. Sanderson remained true to the essence of these characters in this ending. I shed more than a few tears reading this book. After all of the time over the years spent witnessing the lives of these characters... trials,  tragedies, triumphs... this book moved me deeply. I will miss them. Yeah! I know...Get a life!<br /><br />At one point, Robert Jordan was thinking of expanding the series, inviting other writers to contribute to his world. I hope in the future that Tor and Harriet Jordan may consider doing so.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I could not finish watching it. The language was a low blow.  That Teddy Bear need a class in manners.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I got this for my 12 year old son for Christmas and now we're all hooked. It's the first thing we listen to in the mornings on our way to school/work. LOVE IT!! Will definitely be getting more of their CD's in the future.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a story of a doctor going through an out of body experience when suffering a stroke...without giving this story away...he becomes more aware and better equiped in helping future patiences.<br /><br />J F. Bigras
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game works fine, I enjoy playing. Only problems is that an ad pops up between each game. Need to eleminate pop ups
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have never been  disappointed by a Grisham book!  Surely not by The Litigators. Good read, as usual, right up to the last  page.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this product is excellent.  Very informative and easy to get your weather at a glance.  I use it everyday; first thing in the morning!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I could not put this book down. Took so many unexpected turns! I loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" And was happy to find a sequel.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey has become a family favorite series. ALl my siblings (4) and my kids (2) love DA and we enjoy it in groups. I wish they produced more than 9 in a season. ALL TV should be this good!!!<br /><br />DA is a masterpiece of artistry in location, sets, lighting, production, directing, acting and storytelling. As a program director and videographer I really appreciate the exceptional visual quality, some of the camera moves are without equal. As one who hand held a video camera for a single 9 minute walk through yacht shot on Live TV I know how difficult it is to travel with a camera and rigging hanging from you. The photographers are constantly delighting us with extraordinary long moving shots that are so well staged and choreographed. Buy this series, it's awesome!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing spider. This app is better than the computer version I have. It is great fun to play!
B00005J6T1|5.0|I love all of Madonna's 80's music.  I love this debut album.  Madonna was always much better than the critics wanted to give<br />her credit for.
030758836X|1.0|After seeing so many good reviews for this book, I expected much more than a set of characters who were not worth thinking about at all. The only reason I finished it was because it was the selection for my book group. I did not like the writing, the characters, or the plot.
B00005YU98|4.0|I've been a fan of the Waterboys for 20 years, but just recently purchased this CD.  It's interesting to hear these songs that preceded their next great albums: This Is The Sea and Fisherman's Blues. My favorite is the title track, which comes at you like a wall of sound.  Phil Spector would not feel out of place. Not sure the bonus tracks add a lot, but they are fun to hear. The whole album makes a great listen on road trips.  Considering the time that this originally came out, it feels miles ahead of the competition in songwriting quality & production.  If you like their later work (especially This Is The Sea), check this out!
B000SEKNUK|5.0|Rosamund and Ben Zander have written an inspiring book that appeals to many different people in various career paths. I myself am coming from a corporate background and gravitated to this book to give me a different view point of working through my everyday life. One of the first things I took from the reading is that life is full of labels - so why not just create your own? After that early concept, I was hooked through the end of the read. They pepper the book with real life examples that are both interesting and enlightening. I've gone beyond this to view Ben's talks both at TedEx and Davos and am amazed by his passion and zeal for creating the possibility in his own life, as well as those he encounters.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I must have read this about three times so far and i'll probably keep reading it over and over again.  It shows what life would be like if superheroes were real.  It shows them as people, and how the government and society would react to their existence.  Moore is an absolute Genius.  I can't recommend this book enough, but i can recommend the individual books about the characters.  go check those out too
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series, the many characters and the many plot lines...i enjoy seeing the lives of the servants alongside the gentry and how their lives intertwine and change as the world changes..I missed the first show of the season on my dvr so had to come to amazon and immediately watch it.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|The movie Rocky was an original back in the 1970's, and it still shines today.  By itself, it's worth having in any movie collection.  But this collection is THE ONE to get, because of the extras on disc 2.  Almost every aspect of the film is covered in detail, with Sylvester Stallone guiding the way.  For anyone who loves the movie, or has an interest in how movies are made, it's a must-have.  From the writing phase, to financing, casting, locations, scoring and more, you'll learn how this movie came to be.  You'll see and hear from the actual people who created it and understand the struggle to get this project off the ground and across the finish line.  Stallone provides commentary on his life at the time, and details throughout the entire movie, explaining everything from camera placement to acting motivations.  It's hard to believe the cast & crew pulled this off in a matter of weeks; and you'll learn how that time limit (and their low budget) made the movie even better.  Bottom line: this is one great movie, plus an insider's view detailing how the pieces fit together.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|anyone that is interested in bringing the spice back into thier relationship, it is a must to continuing in reading the rest.
0525478817|4.0|I like to think that I'm pretty particular about books and that I don't read a lot of fluff and junk. I like quite a bit of Young Adult books for an adult, and there is some truly excellent YA literature out there that can be equally enjoyed by adults. I think that this book is one of those examples. I reserve 5 stars for truly excellent books and absolute favorites. While I think this book is very, very good, and is absolutely worth reading, it's not what I call excellent. But like I said, it's very, very good. I enjoyed the plot, I enjoyed the characters, and I enjoyed most of the dialogue. There are definitely some instances where you feel like kids wouldn't talk the way they are, but I didn't mind that unrealistic part of it. It certainly didn't kill the remaining good points to the book. It has a pretty predictable ending, but it's a great story, it captured my attention and kept it, it reads quickly, and I found myself thinking about this book for the rest of the day. I highly recommend it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Read the books first and loved them, the series definitely does the first book justice. Casting was perfect, and the sets were amazing!
1612185495|5.0|This was an amazing purchase for the price.  How can you not want to read where Bond began. Thank you, thank you. Trusted seller.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't seem to put these books down. My husband and iI both read these together and LOVED it. We are more in LOve than We were bearfore. we have been together for over 27  and look forward to the next  27 years. I LOVE YOU MORE AND MORE EVERYDAY!!!!
0062206281|2.0|I'm a huge fan of CRZ and loved his previous two adult novels. I have not yet read his YA novels, but I intend to at some point. This book is really quite boring. Not much happens, doesn't keep my attention. All in all, it's a far cry from the wonderfulness of his first two books. That being said, I think it was a stepping stone to something else. Although I only gave it 2 stars, I'm glad I read it because I will be informed if more is to come. It was a pretty fast read at least, and the writing is great, as usual. If you're a CRZ fan, just skim it so you're up to speed, but don't expect great things.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|I've always loved this movie, such a great combination of action and satirical humor, and pretty good effects for the time
B00021R7CG|4.0|This is a good film for those of you who like Doomsday Scenarios. The Cold War is over now, but still the scenarios linger. This drama explores an (accidental yet plausible) scenario. Along the lines of Sidney Lumet's Failsafe and/or the Bedford Incident. This film shows how situations can escalate out of proportion quickly to nightmarish results. Not a lot of extras on this DVD though, but still classic late 80's early 90's pre-Paristroika Paranoia.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i so much enjoyed reading this with my husband.it was a great time sharing time and intimacy with eachother.i love you more & more.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I am always trying to learn new words so this comes in handy!!! So convienient! I have it on my iphone and kindle fire.
B000I8G5B2|2.0|i thought it would get more eceiting but i was wrong, sand the two guys dont look a like at all
078322947X|3.0|Not a lot of extras on this DVD, but the Sountrack IS by Tangerine Dream. William Freidkin (Director of the French Connection) attempt to remake the classic 1953 Wages of Fear by Henri-Georges Clouzot with a slightly different take on it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a very fun game I can't stop playing it will there be any more places in subway surfers coming out?
141659521X|4.0|Once again Vince Flynn releases Mitch to do what he does best ! When they finally make the movies, I sure hope they do them justice !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fantastic app. great graphics and a wonderful gameplay experience!!! I would reccomend this awesome game to horselovers of all ages.
1452110581|2.0|Silly, and not in an entertaining way. Waste of money. Wouldn't call the writing poetry, more like rambling. Look elsewhere.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting! It's fun and always has great challenges. My five year old loves the game and plays it all the time.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Good story line , but just as I was getting drawn in , there would be a mis  spelled word or missing word. Really took the magic out  of the moment. Probably will not read the other two.
0385342039|5.0|This storyline is querky and unusual but so capitivating.  I travel for my job and found myself laughing so hard on the plane (which I hate flying to begin with).  It made my ride pleasant.  Another hit by Sophie Kinsella!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed these books. By book 2 I was hooked. I'm exhausted because I've been staying up reading all night. I was drawn in by the characters and the description of how human life can thrive in an underground environment. The story is well written and vivid and I look forward to reading more of Hugh Howey's books.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|This is a great movie that was very entertaining all the way through.  If you are looking for something deep and serious this is not the movie for you.  I streamed it and the quality of the stream was very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever<br />So fun it is just like temple run but a little different it is so hard to get the limited time people/hoverboard
0385342063|5.0|Poppy is such a relatable character and her adventures in this book get you personally invested in helping her.  Her relationship with Magnus is an interesting one.<br /><br />I loved this book!!!!!  Sophie Kinsella is wonderful at writing.  He written works are witty and always keep you engaged.<br /><br />There was only one negative, I found the foot notes at the end of every chapter very distracting and didn't end up reading them.  Other than that, awesome book.<br /><br />Another hit.  This has to be one of my favorites so far.
1609611543|5.0|It had been a loosing battle for me to loose weight over more years than I want to admit to. After seeing Dr. Davis on TV and then buying and reading his WHEAT BELLY book, I started slowly implementing his suggestions into my daily eating choices in Jan. of 2012. It wasn't hard to find non-wheat foods in the local grocery stores....one does have to carefully read ingredient labels and assume nothing!  My gut was accepting the changes nicely, I liked the taste of my new food selections, noticed right away that I was &#34;full&#34; before my plate was empty - more leftovers went into the fridge.  Surprisingly, the cravings for sweets disappeared right away.  Before too long, my clothing started getting rather baggy.  This continued to occur and a year later, I can happily report the loss of more than clothing 4 sizes....getting really close to the size 8 that I used to be.  I haven't put myself under any pressure by weighing myself....just kept on moving into smaller sized clothing that fit!  I don't have baggy skin, I FEEL BETTER, sleep better and look more like I used to!  My eternal thanks to Dr. Davis for his efforts in writing this book!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Comparable to the hunger games.  Definitely keeps you on you toes with the plot never really sure what's going to happen
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great storyline. great graphics. I paid the 3.99 for full version but it only lasted a couple of hours total. I was disappointed when it was over. no bugs or glitches as others reported....hurray. loved the game though!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Super fast shipping! Thank you so much for such a great item. Everything is just like the advertisement offered!  I will recommend all my friends
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Plenty of stations and the interface is good but I have had the same issues with the program from day one. It takes two to three times of a splash screen to close it. Also it only records about 30 minutes of music before shutting off recording.   Restarts after a phone call. I really hate this app but like listening to radio stations from another state.  Won't record in the back ground and plays the same commercials ad nauseam. I f'n hate Flo...
B004FRX0MY|5.0|How needs that other online store?  I find everything I need at Amazon.com and this app works so well with my android device.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app because it has building action and adventure.This is my favorite app no doubt!!!! the only issue is the price

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good and easy read. It's pretty exciting and you'll want to keep reading. Can finish the book in one day.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very good telling of the situation in Iraq. And a truthful account of his career and his view on what people should be feeling about are military and what their doing over there for are country  and are way of life.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I lovedthis game. I couldn't stop playing! I love the adventure strategy games and this is rte best ive played so far.
B009E3EY38|5.0|It's Led Zeppelin Live, enough said. I am now rambling to come up with fourteen more words to submit review.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Excellent reading. Get,s the adrenalin moving, just reading about it. The SEALS are true profesionals, dedicated to getting the job done just right.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I am very pleased with this CD.  I really like &#34;Maroon Five&#34;, and I will enjoy this product for a long time!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I record high quality audio for an Internet Radio Show as well as multitrack instruments.  Works as promised for such a low price.  I also plan on using it for live shows when I figure out how to properly incorporate it.  Comes with a very good software bundle too that I haven't had time to review.  Well worth the price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a game.<br />It's like temple run and temple run 2.<br />Running.<br />Good idea.<br />A little bit hard.<br />Easy.<br />Awesomeness.<br />Awesome.<br />Cool.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is a great cd, I'd even go as far as saying it's one of their best, at least in my opinion. It's definitely my favorite cd of theirs. Stand out songs; Closer, I Was A Fool, I'm Not Your Hero, Love They Say and Now I'm All Messed Up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have played this game for quite a while on my iPhone, and it is amazing. There are a few differences here, but it is still a great game.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Drama, thrills, suspense, love all fun! Hard to wait week to week now for the new episodes. It is a must watch
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I THINK THIS IS THE BEST BOOK OUT OF ALL OF THE BOOKS RIGHT ALONG WITH CABIN FEVER<br /><br />AAAAAWWWWEEEEEESSOOOMMMEE BOOK
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Extremely addictive. Better on the Kindle than on the cell phone. Power-ups and character up grades make for loads of fun.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you enjoyed Season 1 and want to see the characters evolve, this is a must.<br /><br />I ordered it on Amazon Instant Video; streaming on my Wii was slow, but I can't be 100% sure the problem wasn't on my end, so it still gets five stars.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is such a believable character!  Michael does a great job tying up loose ends in his books. Can't wait for another one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool beans ;) I love it so munch that I would go crazy for the second one!!!!!!!!;);;););)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like to read romance books.  I expecially liked this book because it had suspense to it up to the very end.  It also had some twists and turns to the story that was not predictable.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|I can't wait for part two.<br /><br />If you read the graphic novel in 1986 (I think), you know the story. If you love the graphic novel, you'll love this movie. It is animated, but it's not a cartoon. Don't let your 5 year old watch it. This isn't the 1960's Adam West Batman. It isn't a funny movie.<br /><br />But if you didn't like the graphic novel, don't watch this, because it's about as faithful as you can get without some of the inner dialog Batman has in the book.<br /><br />I sure wish this was live action...but it is well worth seeing it in animation.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I almost gave up on this book but stuck it out to the end.  It is okay.  It leaves  room for a second book but I am not sure I would read it.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I know this review is going to get smothered by all the glowing ones. But come on, people. Five stars? For a story told entirely in unrealistic dialogue and overused gestures? A story void of scene setting, aside from the stars on the main character's ceiling? No characterization, aside from the hero having dimples (and the sentimentality of a melodramatic grandmother, but we'll get to that next). No powerful verbs whatsoever? If anyone &#34;grabs&#34; something ONE more time I think I'm going to lose my mind. Seriously. And all the smiling. He smiles, she smiles, they smile. Count how many times those verbs are used. One paragraph had the same verb (&#34;fill&#34; if I remember correctly) six times. Creativity is a big part of writing, and it was not employed at all here.  Now, the hero's dialogue. Who's speaking those words, an 18-year-old man? No way. And the cheek stroking, face holding, hair caressing he does to the heroine--I'm sorry, but I don't know what world this is supposed to be, but it's not Earth. He's not a human male. This is not how heterosexual human males act. Maybe it's how some women want men to act, but not me. I'd be creeped out big time. And telling me this guy has two personalities does not prove it to me. I honestly don't know what made the heroine decide that early on besides the fact the author wanted her to decide that. Having the hero punch lockers on one page and say flowery things about how he's not &#34;ready to love her yet&#34; but he is ready to &#34;live&#34; her... only proves he can punch lockers and say things the author wants him to say, in this strange world where men speak like women. He's not a realistic character. What 18-year-old man says this (below) to his girlfriend of a couple weeks?  &#34;I told myself to just stay away from you and let you be mad at me, because I do have so many issues that I'm not ready to share with you yet. And I tried so hard to stay away, but I can't. I'm not strong enough to keep denying whatever this is we could have. And yesterday in the lunchroom when you were hugging Breckin and laughing with him? It felt so good to see you happy, Sky. But I wanted so bad to be the one who was making you laugh like that. It was tearing me up inside that you were thinking that I didn't care about us, or that spending that weekend with you wasn't the best weekend I've ever had in my life. Because I do care and it was the best. It was the best f*ing weekend in the history of all weekends.&#34;  Read that aloud. No, have a man read that aloud. Need I say more? And punching lockers? It's borderline cliche. Dig for something unique and powerful. Make him do something we haven't seen over and over.  Now, backstory. The hero is a little boy. What four-year-old boy says, &#34;Will you promise me something...Will you promise me that when he makes you sad, you'll think about the sky?&#34; to a three-year-old girl? This is not how children interact. Ever. It's an author with a puppet, trying to make her readers grasp their chests and cry out from the overblown sentimentality of it all. Trying to turn us into fools.  This is self-published, yes. But that does not remove the author from the responsibility of quality writing you have to work on. Writing you have to dig for. It does not free the writer from learning how to craft strong sentences, or how to self-edit. Please don't make your readers trudge through sentence after sentence explaining every tiny move each character makes. Don't make your character &#34;reach up and wipe a tear from my eye.&#34; Where else would that tear be, on her forehead? And of course she reaches. We don't need to know that. Just make her wipe a tear. PLEASE. And don't make a character walk into the bathroom, squeeze toothpaste on the toothbrush, put the toothbrush in her mouth, then come back out of the bathroom. We all know how it works. Just make her brush her teeth. Or, don't, because it's not at all relevant to the story. And the love scenes. Please spare us from where he puts his arm, where she puts her leg, where he puts his leg, where she puts her arm. I want to *feel* their love. Not be given the stage directions.  We have to hold self-published books to the standards of regularly published books. We spend our money and precious time on reading books. We don't care how they're published as long as the author has put effort into writing something worth our time. Heft by Liz Moore--that's a five star novel. You can't say you don't feel every emotion of those characters as if they were your own. Gone Girl--that's another. You're transported to that town. You smell The Bar. You feel his stomach clench every time someone catches something he's slipped up on. Those people are real people. And things happen. There's action. The dialogue is real. People aren't lying around having cliche-ridden, unrealistic conversations suited for a Hallmark movie. If you want your stomach to hurt from being a witness to child abuse, read Warchild by Karin Lowachee. If you want to feel the bond of love between teenagers despite the horror in their lives, read Lights Out in the Reptile House by Jim Shepard. That's writing.  I suppose everything has an audience, even Hallmark movies and bad soap operas. But most would agree that isn't 5-star entertainment. Right? Taste is subjective, I know. A child's doodle is art to the child's mother, but is it going to go up in the Louvre? Best sellers have a wide appeal or they wouldn't be best sellers. It's very hard for me to believe I'm in such a minority on this one though. Pick any sentence out of this book and remove three words--not articles or prepositions, bigger words. Nouns, adjectives and verbs. Give that sentence to ten people. I'm certain all ten people will come up with the same exact sentence as the one in the book. If that doesn't tell you something, I don't know what does.  And the &#34;plot twists&#34; everyone goes on about? A plot twist is &#34;Luke, I am your father.&#34; It has to come out of left field. Every supposed &#34;plot twist&#34; in this book could be seen well before it happened. That's just plot. No twist. And a very predictable plot. But maybe not for someone who... I don't know... lives on Mars? Come on people! The writer may be that sheltered, but I can't believe so many readers are as well.  Writing a novel is more than just spitting out words. It's a craft, it's what a writer must learn and practice and hone. It's what separates people who like to write stories in their diaries from people who build characters and build worlds--complete with real emotions, natural dialogue, sights, sounds, and smells. And this book falls so short of that. Self-publishing is such a great thing, and we need to demand more than what this book has given us. If we keep voting uninspired works like this as 5-star novels, self-publishing will become... hopeless.  Edit: Just as I expected, this review got a steady stream of &#34;Yes this review was helpful&#34; votes until it suddenly got about 20 &#34;No&#34; votes overnight. This writer must have a mob of people voting the highly critical 1-star reviews down, so that the same mildly critical 3-star review always appears as the &#34;most helpful critical review&#34;. Can anyone say scam artist?

B008B92U32|5.0|This app is a ton of fun!  Most people secretly like to take pictures of themselves but this puts a new twist on it.  With &quot;Face Swap&quot; you can switch your face with anyone else in the photo or even take a series of pics of yourself and switch them all around.  I had a bunch of fun switching my face from different photos around.....now I have a picture that looks like I'm wearing a winter hat with my swimsuit on the beach.<br /><br />Yes, it's silly but there are a lot of uses for it that I can see.  I'm an artist and this will be a great app to use for some surreal photo projects.<br /><br />It's easy to use, intuitive and a bunch of fun.  If I hadn't been lucky enough to get this as FAOTD, I definitely would have bought it, highly recommended.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|I really like this game.  It it quite addicting.  I did turn off the sound, that can be a little distracting.  I chose 4 stars because it is easy to play and there are several variations to it.  It is not boring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i think this game is stupid because it  takes litaly a year to load and when u play u just swipe and duck the whole time lame
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|an unbelivable surprise story line.  I thought at first I made mistake to purchase this book as I thought it was only about a sex relationship between a young girl and boy but I as I got into it, the story of her past was a page turner.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|This book held great promise but unfortunately fell short with every page I read. The idea of a white indentured servant girl mingling with black slaves in Federal America, admittedly is a fresh take on a much covered topic. Yes, in the early days of our country there were indeed a mingling of cultures and all bonded servants held a similar fate, both white and black. So in that Grissom, got a few things right, but the rest was a horrible mingling of time periods vascillating from 1790's, when the story opens to 1860's and beyond, when in actuality the story never progresses past circa 1815.<br /><br />The historical anachronisms are too numerous to mention. There is no solid historical data to ground the story in the time period. This is the era of \\"good feeling\\" when the country is young, still eeking out an existence on the frontier, expanding westward, still wrangling with British, Spanish and French and Native tribes, and yet we are given a view of Southern moonlight and magnolias that is more indicative of a slightly later period when America has fully established her toehold on the continent. Having worked at a historic site where we portray the early Federal Period, I found nothing recognizable in this book that would make me think it was a true representation of this era.<br /><br />The overall plot and ending were far too fast paced and ludicrous for such a short novel as well. Rather than take what could have been a riveting and thought provoking story of culture and class differences against the backdrop of an often forgotten but fascinating history of early America, Grisson tries to infuse 21st century political correctness and hot button events that would be unlikely to have happened all to one family in such a brief time span. So she threw in everything she could think of just to make a novel sell, and apparently it does to the less informed.<br /><br />How any agent or publisher thought to take this one on is a baffling. There are many well written historical novels by lesser houses and even some self published ones I've found far better researched and far better written. Most of the prose is conveyed through telling with little to actually pull me into the story and make me care about the characters. It jumps over large spans of time highlighting only the sensational aspects without giving us a chance to thoroughly feel the setting and time period. The fact that the author credits having recieved the story via \\"voices\\" of the ghosts who lived this is an insult to good historic research and also to the \\"voices\\" she presumably was channeling. I would have hoped such spirits would recall their own life and times a bit better than what she conveys, but maybe she confused which ghosts to channel from which era. Better to stick with solid research when writing historical fiction and leave the channeling to other purposes or not at all.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it because it is so hard it will not tell you how to do stuff so I only like it
044042321X|3.0|it is a nice book but it is not what I thought it was. I thought it was a normal book. I should have read details more carefully.
B00846REIS|5.0|the book is awesome!! and i read the second one and that was even better.  cant wait until #3 comes out.  i hate having the book end because then I don't get to read about Gideon everyday. LOL!!

B00846REIS|5.0|Finally a book where both male and female characters have their own story. Fifty Shades of Grey is a great trilogy, but it was only one sided. This book has his and hers.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie a lot. Very, very funny, especially Fat Amy. Heartfelt, too. The songs and mash-ups were performed well. A Definite see.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The story started out good but kept going downhill until it just ended. Cute at first but eventually the hook was gone.

B005G4TJUC|4.0|I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome. I haven't gotten all the prizes but that cause its addicting as soon as I wake up I play and I play right before I go to bed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's awesome, real talk. The only thing bad about it is if u pause the game, and go to another app, the game reboots, and all ur progress on that run is gone.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have cancer and it is almost impossible to sleep at night.  This app helps my body calm down and patterns my heart beats to the individual tones and sounds so I can get into a deep sleep.  This has been a lifesaver.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed The Carnival. The game has different levels of play so it can be a challenge to several skill levels. Not too scary as a storyline and there is a nice redeeming twist. Would recommend.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think this book has given me some insight to what makes a marriage something great. I look forward to applying its practical suggestions.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book for the history,culture and country of Yemen. I loved all the military technology. I don't like  alot of violence or gore so this was good for me. I also think the author is extremely funny and balanced the book with his humor. My favorite books of his were the Gate House , The Lion, and now, The Panther.
030758836X|3.0|The well written story held my interest for the first two thirds of the book, hence my 3 Star rating. It went down hill after Amy reconnected with Desi ultimately leading to her return to Nick. Her pregnancy through the use of Nick's saved semen and her diabolical attachment to Nick lacked believability. Frankly, the ending was a huge disappointment.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use it on travel to other countries in central america<br />It pick alot of radio stations from local country<br />Good buy
B000SEI230|5.0|This book truly warmed my heart. It's filled with joy, sadness and love. I'm not sure how anyone could read this book and not absolutely love it!! I appreciated how the author incorporated biblical references. As a Christian this book tugs at your heartstrings. Her faith in God, His love, and plan is amazing! This book is not only a beautiful story but is full of life lessons. Well done!!!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I show this film to high school students who sometimes struggle with  being kind.  There is a risk of kindness, but the rewards are great!!

B00A9X9ORI|1.0|I was excited to see this movie, but then it quickly turned to disappointment. So confusing and random. Just made no sense.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Plenty of great reviews. Just wanted to throw my stars on. This movie rocks. Comedy. Action. PG-13. Are you kidding? Excellent. Go. Buy.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this app has been very useful. It is quick and convenient, and I love the fact that I can grab it from any of my devices and anything that I put in it is available. I use it often as a photograph link as well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app-- easy to read and navigate. Love the day to day arthitis and asthma forecasts. What else can say except you really can't beat a free app.
0060566108|1.0|The author uses many successful companies in his examples. The implications are that if a company has Big Goals it will have corresponding Big Successes. The counterpoint is ignored, that with Big Goals comes the possibility of Big Failures. Both are interesting studies, but this book only addresses the former and ignores the latter.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I don't regret taking the time to read this book, but it definitely lost steam at the end, and I hated the ending of this book, which was very disappointing. I would recommend this book, but I would also give fair warning about a poor ending.
B009APMNB0|4.0|I would recommend this product for one reason only, that it does make a difference in how the colors look on the screen and also when you are into the Photoshop program(s).  This is a very good product to have especially for students who are taking photography classes and other camera classes.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I was immediately drawn into the style of writing of Martin. I have read just a few books which are able to capture my attention quite like A Game of Thrones. So this review is not centered on his ability to write, for I think he is a great writer. This review is particularly speaking about many of the scenes which I was rather disappointed with.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Tolkien, Lewis, Macdonald, Rowling, and many other Fantasy writers. Each of these authors are fantastic at writing and made quite a bit of money from their individual works. Yet inside of these works, they never felt the need to include pornographic scenes in order to persuade people to read their books. However, when I read A Game of Thrones, I found these scenes very annoying. Martin implements these scenes slowly-perhaps not to shock some of the younger readers. However, If I wanted a book which had childish smut, I would have bought 50 Shades of Gray. But I bought this book because of the mature level of writing I expected in the pages.<br /><br />I know that this book made any clams of allowing children to read-I am still disappointed with Martin for this one reason. This is why I have decided to give him 3 stars on this one.
B004H8GLXQ|2.0|It was supposed to be new, that's what it said, that was an overstocked item. Not happy at all. I'll keep it because I need it for a school project.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great sequel to the number games. Ready for<br /> the final of the series and more from the author. Let's go
B000W796OM|4.0|I liked the way the movie was sent out right away.  I and some of my friends are Harry Potter fans, so we appreciate the movie and how fast the deliver of the movie came about.  I will differently recommend people to check out the site for good movies and other things  on the site.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book. I really enjoyed it. I give it five stars. I love Stephen king and read anything he writes.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|The fact that the authour was able to actually able to formulate a sentence (or feed himself etc.) after his ordeal is a miracle.  The fact that this book was written at all is enough of a story in itself.<br /><br />However, the story he recounts is stunning.<br /><br />The story he has to tell should be read by anyone interested in the topic of &#34;what lies beyond the grave&#34;, or anyone touched by grief  - and that's all of us isn't it? It's a startling story written by a scientist in simple language that we all can immediately grasp and relate to. I keep recommending it to people and they keep coming back to me saying &#34;wow&#34;.
B004UJCYYW|5.0|C'est un classique incontournable, très beau. La version est correcte, bien qu'on ne puisse pas trouver facilement les chapitres sur la liseuse. Nulle version cinématographique ou audiovisuelle peut le remplacer, car il y a plein de réflexions philosophiques et historiques de la part de Hugo. Très recommandable, mais il faut disposer de beaucoup de temps. Idéal pour les grandes vacances. Virginie

There are however some glitches. sometimes the only playable tile is actually underneath another tile yet it is still playable. also it does freeze periodically.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Love it. Should have kept going with series. I think it would be great to start another series or more books.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|This is an AWESOME experience to say the least. I feel like the Blue Man Group has moved in when this Blu-ray is on, really. My friends and neighbors all agree that its as close to a live concert that they have heard before on my 9.2 setup.
B00092ZL80|4.0|A most excellent combination of talent and great music.  The showmanship is great, but it pales in comparison to the awesome tunage.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i really like the game but i cant even play it when ever i try to reopen it it just crashes and cant even play it and it just gets on my nerves i havent even touched it since it came out!!!!
B00B0NDF26|2.0|I was excited when I first saw the raving reviews for the new Tegan and Sara. I'm a big fan of their other CD's, where every song was unique and gave the listener something interesting to hear. However, I was very disappointed when I listened to Heartthrob all the way through. All I could think of was Mall music from the 80's or early 90's, of the likes of Tiffany and others. If you are a big fan of Pop music, then this CD may be great for you, but for me it just fell flat. All of the songs sound the same (with a couple of exceptions... Shock to Your System is a pretty good song), making a much less interesting compilation - boring almost. I could be alone in this thought, but I will say that the new CD is a bit of a departure from their old work. I would suggest that anyone interested in buying the album sample it first. I understand how many could love the catchy choruses and beats, but it is just not for me.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|What else can be said about Adele? I have the dvd/cd as well, so you know how much I love her music.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best book so far in the Rebus series.  It blends his darker irreverence, grittiness and old-style determination to just the right mix; and the story line is as expected from Rankin: fast-paced, intriguing, with delightful twists and turns
B00992CF6W|4.0|all my friends are getting 0.6.0 and I cant get it and they play together. i feel left out please get 0.6.0 soon amazon/kindle
B002M9WW30|5.0|Yes it is worth it....we moved to Philly cause of it the set.  Love it here so you should all come visit.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show!  I've just recently decided to watch this show after hearing several people talk about it.  I am so glad that I did.  I truly love this show and the characters!  I'm addicted.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Poorly conceived, badly executed -- a real waste of time despite the slick trailers.  No need to spend your money on this one.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|There are some people and critics have been stuck on the fact that Heartthrob has a completely different sound than what Tegan and Sara traditionally sound like. Personally, I like the change. I love their old stuff, but this new CD has a better cohesion than their other albums. The intellectual content of the songs is still as deep and meaty yet simple as you'd expect from them. I find this new album to be more accessible to new fans who aren't use to or \\"get\\" their \\"old\\" sound. I'm confident Tegan and Sara's fanbase will only grow because of Heartthrob. I'm not even sure we should call their sound on this record \\"new\\" because it honestly sounds like a more developed \\"Sara\\" sound, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've been able to sit and listen to an entire album without skipping songs or taking a break. The songs are relatable, catchy, and even the sad ones make you feel good somehow.<br /><br />Tegan and Sara didn't let us down. The wait was worth it!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is not a &#34;reimagining&#34; of the world if JFK had not been killed, as I had expected when I bought it, but a story about the people involved in trying to rewrite history.  Very imaginative and great characterizations as always with Mr. King.  He can get inside people's heads like nobody else.  I was surprised to find the clown from &#34;It&#34; in this story!  Fascinating details about all the myriad players in this saddest drama of our contemporary history.
B009LDD590|2.0|Season three of \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" boasts a fantastic cast and gorgeous production values. Unfortunately, the major storyline is a predictable tale of turf war between two gangsters - the sort of plot we've all seen 1,000 times before. So, in my (admittedly dissenting) opinion, the prodigious talent of the actors and designers is wasted on scripts that seem sophisticated on the surface, but are actually just lurid and unoriginal.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest waste of talent is the casting of Steve Buscemi as the chief gangster, Nucky Thompson - a thoroughly boring character whose defining trait is being really impatient with his subordinates (one wonders why anyone remains loyal to him!) Now, I really love Buscemi in movies like Fargo and Ghost World, where he gives wonderfully strange and funny performances. But why should I want to see him cast as a standard \\"heavy\\" in this series? He simply doesn't work in this context.<br /><br />On a positive note, several of the other characters are far more interesting than Nucky. I particularly like Jack Huston as Richard Harrow, a sympathetically portrayed veteran, and Michael Shannon as George Mueller, who in this season works a demeaning job as an electric iron salesman. The sequences featuring these characters tend to have a lot more humor, heart and interest than the clichéd gangster material.<br /><br />But alas, for every good character in the show, there is a corresponding boring one. For example, I have little love for Gretchen Mol's bizarre madam character, who spends the entire season complaining that she doesn't have enough upkeep money for her brothel. Another weak point is Nucky's wife, played by Kelly Macdonald, who features in a storyline about starting a women's health clinic that shows promise but goes absolutely nowhere. The main villain of the season, meanwhile, is very entertaining but not terribly convincing; how would such a clearly unhinged guy ever rise to a position of real power in the underworld?<br /><br />The quality of the show see-saws tremendously depending on which of these characters is heavily featured in an episode. But, viewing it as a whole, I found this season to be rather weak. Too many of the episodes are talky and dull, and when the \\"action\\" arrives, it usually takes the form of some tacky sex scene or predictable explosion of violence. In the end, the show feels more like a bad pulp novel than a truly intelligent drama. Frankly, I'd rather watch The Godfather instead...or The Sopranos, or Fargo, or maybe an old James Cagney movie. This show doesn't really bring anything new to the gangster genre.
0316017922|4.0|There is an exercise within my profession, called a genogram, that helps therapists \\"see\\" the person with whom they are sitting in a more accurate contextual setting.  After one has completed this task, often a clearer picture of how the individual arrived at their present dilemma can be seen.  This present book is a \\"genogram,\\" of sorts, of success.  Mr. Gladwell contents that successful people do not become so haphazardly, overnight nor in isolation.  Each successful person has history, or is in a precise historical moment, that helped them cease the moment and, after much hard work, became successful.<br />Mr. Gladwell, as is confirmed by his other books, sees the world in such a way that all parts are connected together.  He has the ability to translate those connections into a readable, understandable and absorbing writing style that had this Student perusing this book like a novel.<br />In this tome, Mr. Gladwell seeks to determine exactly what \\"causes\\" success.  He begins with how opportunity actually occurs in the development of success, and the reader learns it is more about timing than background, heritage or location, although those factors are of a certain importance.  Starting with a Canadian all-star Hockey team, the author details how timing, sustained effort (10,000 hours of hard work) at a task, the background of learning how to \\"argue ones point\\" and doing what is before one creates the occasion for success to occur.  That occasion is an influential one, too.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell then follows the thread of connectedness to the heritage of success.  Heritage not in terms of privilege, but more of how ones' ancestors have influence over the kind of success one will experience.  From Harlan, Kentucky, where feuds were common in the last 100 years, but the ground work for the feuds actually began hundreds of years before in the Highlands of the British Isles, to Korean Air and their disastrous record in the early 1990's, to the rice paddies of Asia(that has greatly influenced the mathematical knowledge of the Asians) and finally how one of the worst school systems in the nation became the model of successful education (their students go to school 9-10 hours a day Monday - Friday, plus four hours on Saturday, plus multiple hours of homework and they love the process), the author paints a graphic picture of what really is essential in becoming successful.<br />As mentioned above this is an easily read book, which is an indicator the author is clear in his understanding of the subject at hand.  There is nothing here that would offend even the youngest of readers, but those reading this book do need to have abstract thinking skills in order to make the connections offered by the offer.<br />Reading this book reminded me of how far reaching is history in determining present day actions.  It seems George Santayana's statement, \\"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\\" could be amended to \\"the past will probably be repeated, even with its being remembered.\\"  In my own world, this work helped me grasp my own responses to events that seem to be out of my character - those responses are rooted in my family heritage reaching back at least 200 years.  Bless my roots!  But there is far more information within these pages than just the effect of history on success.  Each chapter could be the \\"tipping point\\" for one's leap toward success.<br />After reading this work, I reflected upon Paul's admonition to the Romans (chapter 12:2) of being \\"transformed by the renewing of (one's) mind\\" and how much of the author's assertions are needed for this to occur.  This raises the question for me, as one seeking deep Spiritual awareness, \\"how much of my quest for God is dependent upon me and how much is to be left to God?\\"

B00AFEY7QO|5.0|Splendid jazz interpretations of some of their classic songs, as well as a few surprises. Re-recording material with the 'unplugged', acoustic production approach  has been attempted by many  musical artists, across a broad spectrum of genres with varying degrees of success. This project, Private View by Swing Out Sister, is without question one of the finest of this kind ever created. The new arrangements, musicianship, delivery and feel, breathe new life into already classy, original and brilliant songs making for an entirely new and fresh discovery. The concert DVD is of the highest quality as well. 'Private View' is highly recommended for new fans looking for some outstanding sophisticated jazz\pop and for the old, to enjoy a new feel to some of their favorite songs.. great for the classy cocktail party, lounging by the fireplace or pool, or setting the perfect mellow mood.

0439023483|4.0|When a friend, who knows something of one's reading tastes, recommends a novel, that novel has instant \\"status\\" as one that is worthy of the time invested to read.  The friend who recommended this novel was most adamant that I read it.  So I bought it (and the second book in this series), read it and found that, if anything, the book was not commended highly enough.  So engaging was this futuristic work of fiction that I read it in less than three days.<br />Set in a future post civil war destroyed America, now known as \\"Panem,\\" the story is narrated by, and told from the perspective of, Katniss Everdeen.  Katniss lives in District 12, the area responsible for producing the coal for the rest of the country, particularly for the Capital and which was once known as \\"Appalachia.\\"  At 16, she has had to become the provider for her mother and younger sister after her father was killed in a mine explosion.  She does so by hunting and gathering \\"outside the fence\\" of her designated area.  To be caught doing so means  imprisonment at least and a slow, tortuous death at worst.  Spending the last four years honing her skills as an archer and hunter have prepared her to participate in the \\"Hunger Games,\\" an annual event created by The Capital to remind the citizens of Panem of their tenuous hold on life and to punish them for rebelling decades before.  In these games, a male and a female, ages 12 to 18 are chosen (and are called \\"tributes\\") to represent their district in a contest against the other 11 district tributes.  The contest rules are simple, be the last one alive.  That person will receive wealth and luxury for the rest of their lives.<br />The majority of the book takes place, as expected, in the midst of \\"the Games.\\"  There are moments of violence, of course, but they would be rated PG-13, there are no sexual moments but there is tension sufficient to make this a page turner.  While the book would be rated \\"PG-13,\\" the movie, should it ever be made, will be a definite \\"R,\\" as there would be no way to portray teenagers killing each other, or be seen in the clothing Ms. Collins has the characters dressed in at points in the tale, that could be rated less.  This is a Young Adult novel.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is an opportunity to consider contemporary society.  The \\"have nots\\" must labor incessantly, disregarding the personal cost, for the benefit of the faceless \\"haves\\" in a distant Capital that provides nothing but grief and demands upon its subjects.  The destruction that caused these Games to occur is of the citizen's own doing, the Capital had more resources and thus won the war but the Capital was created by the citizenry before the war.  There is much reflection of present America in this tale.  The things that are occurring within our world are of our own creation, the gap between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\" is widening, and the Government is seen to be responsible for the woes that are present in our lives.  Katniss is a reminder that the individual still has choices to make, can be the cause for hope and has the opportunity to be defined in their own terms.<br />To quote a past president, \\"there is nothing wrong with America that cannot be fixed by what his right with America.\\"  We, as a nation, have many struggles ahead of us, problems that must be solved that will require sacrifice and commitment and only each other to depend upon to see each of us survive.  We, as a nation, can play \\"The Hunger Games\\" and strive to be the last one standing.  The winner of that game will rule over a lonely, desolate, wasteland that will not be worth the cost it took to conquer.  Or, as a nation, we can commit that we can work together to accomplish what one alone, or smaller groups, cannot.  The winner(s) in that game will witness a world that is safer, connected, fertile and worth passing along to our descendants.

0439023491|4.0|The story began in The Hunger Games continues in this tale, the second of the trilogy.  The action continues to be fast paced, the villains evil but the plot thickens in ways that causes the reader to be as trapped in a maze as is Katniss, the hero of this futuristic saga.<br />At the end of The Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta have won \\"The Games,\\" the first dual Victors in the history of Panem.  How this came to be is interpreted by President Snow, and many in the country who are tired of 75 years of oppression by \\"The Capitol,\\" as an act of rebellion.  Because of her rebellious actions, Katniss has become an important symbol - to those who desire change a symbol of hope; to those in authority, a symbol that must be quashed.  This is the tension built upon and the spring that powers this story.<br />It is the \\"responsibility\\" (demands of The Capitol) of the Hunger Games Victor is a tour of the Districts and the Capitol that make up Parem & to mentor the next Tributes tine the following years' Games.  Katniss and Peeta are required by President Snow in this tour to stop what they started by surviving the games - defying the Capitol.  When this is not done to the President's satisfaction, there are new punishments in store.  The greatest of these punishments is created in honor of the 75th Anniversary of \\"the Dark Days\\" - the tributes for this special Hunger Games will be drawn from the pool of Victors, instead of the general population.  This puts Katniss back in the arena, fighting for her life.  The Games ends the middle tale of the story but the saga is much deeper than who survives.<br />This novel is much darker than the first.  Katniss, having survived the horrors that are the Hunger Games, is no longer young even though she is but 17 years-of-age.  She wants to make a difference in her world but is also seeing the cost that will take and is cynical that any effort will have effect.  She knows, on a level beyond her years, how deeply connected she is to those around her and they to her.  This is very much a book about growing up, as painful as that process can be.<br /><br />Evidently, in the future there is no conversation about Spiritual matters.  I feel this is a flaw in the series.  All people, particularly when  they are crisis, consider the important questions of \\"why struggle?,\\" \\"Is there anything beyond this life?\\"  These are questions of the Spirit and they are missing form these tales to this point.  This is a story of good versus evil - perhaps that is Spiritual enough.around her and they to her.

140131046X|4.0|When Mitch Albom reconnected with his Sociology Professor (see Albom's book Tuesday's With Morrie) he had little notion of the impact that action would have on his life.  Within eight years, he has gone from an agnostic, nonobservant Jew to one who has grasped the power and worth of being God-minded.  The path he has taken to arrive at this juncture has been recorded in his books and his readers have had the privilege of witnessing this transformation from \\"inside\\" Mr. Albom's own experience.  Those who have read his previous books will better appreciate the story that is the under-tale of this present work.  Those who choose to begin reading Mr. Albom's work with this small book will be delighted with their starting point but will soon find themselves seeking his other works.<br />Mitch Albom's Rabbi asked him to deliver the eulogy.  As Mr. Albom had not been an active member of his congregation since he had gone to college, and this Rabbi was not presently ill, this request caused him no little amount of consternation.  He saw Rabbi Albert Lewis, a.k.a. \\"Reb,\\" as an untouchable \\"Man of God.\\"  How does one eulogize an idol?  He quickly realized his need to get to know the man who is this Rabbi so he could, when the time came, properly fulfill the request.  In order to accomplish this goal he began doing what he learned with Morrie, regular visits with the Reb, what lasted eight months with the Professor, ended up taking eight years with the Reb.<br /><br />In the time Mr. Albom spent with \\"the Reb,\\" he learned of another \\"Man of God,\\" who appeared as anything but.  Henry Covington grew up in the intercity, reared by parents who loved him but whose relationship with each other was often less than peaceful.  He turned to a life of crime early in life, spent time in prison for a crime he did not commit (but one his vanity helped get him convicted) and in a moment of clarity that became epiphany, he changed and began to minister to those who were like him.  Mr. Albom found Rev. Covington, whose parishioners call \\"Reb,\\" ministering in intercity Detroit in a dilapidated, once grand church building.  The church had a hole in its roof so large the congregation had to build shelter in the sanctuary in order to have some sanctuary from the elements of a Detroit winter.<br />What the author learned in these eight years spent in contact with these men (he continues to have contact with Rev. Covington) is as subtle as it is profound.  He is able to \\"sit at the feet\\" of his Rabbi and learn what made him so holy.  He is able to connect with one whom society would deem \\"outcast\\" and discover the Good News that no one is cast away.  Most profoundly, Mr. Albom discovers the holiness that resides in him.  This Holiness can be dimmed by action (or inaction) but it can never be quenched completely.  He grasps this when he takes note of the good he has done when he has chosen \\"not to do bad,\\" when he begins to act as one who is capable of greater good and is connected to the world through the commonness of experience.  Ultimately, Mr. Albom sees both \\"Rebs\\" as men of God not because of who they are, but because of how they understand God to be.  They both want only to tell others of what they have found.  To do so is sound, life-affirming, soul-building preaching of the most powerful kind - which is that done without words.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have some reservations about his recent books that aren't all him, but if I ignore that and just read it as if its a book off the shelf from an author I don't know well, I enjoy the experience.  It does feel like it is lacking something when compared to his original work.  I feel that the plot may have been slower in the beginning with his older work, but it made it all the more impressive when the various pieces would start to click together near the end.  His recent books felt like someone took his style of writing and mixed in some video games to add excitement throughout the plot.  The older way may have been slower and harder to stay with, but that made it seem more realistic and possible in my imagination.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|If atmosphere and believable science fiction worlds are your cup of tea, then watch this movie. It is a entertaining, fun and undeniably interesting.

B008E374PO|1.0|I wish I had never heard this album, because I totally lost the respect I had for Owl City. No clever, poetic lyrics that made you smile or think a little deeper, just pure, what seems almost autotuned, fluff. Even when I try to listen to some of my favorite albums, like Ocean Eyes, the complete sell-out of this album looms in the back of my mind, taking away the joy i once had in listening to Owl City.<br />That being said, if you really enjoyed the song with Carly Rae Jepson or weren't a big fan of Owl City's older stuff, you may enjoy the light lyrics of this album.

I'm usually strictly R&B, but I heard Mercy on VH1 (I think) and the old-school beat was nice so i took a chance and bought the CD and must say I am happy that I made the purchase.  My favorite songs have to be Stepping Stone and Syrup and Honey.  Duffy's voice is so soothing and just has a sound all her own and that is a breath of fresh air because no one else sounds like her.  AWESOME!!
B0074EIQQU|1.0|I saw Mars Volta at the Showbox in Seattle in 2003 when they actually played all their songs with only 20% jamming, Saul Williams opened the show, it was f'n amazing.  I have the De Loused sold-out lyric book, the Frances the Mute pre-album single on vinyl, I think that the XFM sessions from Televators LIVE EP are better than Scabdates blah blah blah...<br /><br />I love electronic rock.  In my collection I have early KMFDM, Skinny Puppy, God Lives Underwater, Puscifer, Frank Zappa, etc. This album is not good as electronic rock or as traditional (pre-Bedlam) Mars Volta.  I have tried to listen to this album and I end up skipping tracks out of boredom or annoyance.  This is the only Mars Volta album besides Scabdates that makes me do that.<br /><br />If you are new to this band then I suggest De-Loused in the Comatorium, Amputechture, Tremulant and late period At the Drive In which are all light years (in every dimension) better than this album.  Hopefully Cedric can make something better on his own as we all know that Omar is more than capable of doing anything with music and making it work somehow.

B009AZZEU2|4.0|Some great stuff on this album but it just doesn't hold a candle to the B-Side they put out Black Rain or Live on I5.  This is better than a Chris Cornell solo album but only slightly less as powerful as Down on the Upside.  They get bonus points for being original and ass kicking as a live band, I saw them with Queens of the Stone Age and Mastodon at the Gorge in 2011.  That being said they are still better than all the bands that have copied them in the last 20 years. Being a long time fan I have a strong feeling that this album will propel the band into something far greater for the next album as I noticed that most of my favorite parts of the album were songs co-written by Cameron and/or Shepard.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's entertaining and all but after a while it gets annoying and then I don't want to play it for a while and I think that the games are to expensive
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The movie was great.  especially seeing in in hd makes the picture a lot better.  I can not complain.  great.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It was so hard to put this book DOWN. I could not wait to read what happens next. A great and wonderful boil
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, I have loved reading this series like so many others. This was written very well and i will read more of Suzanne Collins novels
B008XG1X18|4.0|who doesn't like pinterest? Im happy theres an app for kindle. Its always so much more streamlined then trying to log in through a web browser on the kindle.
B000M9BPEY|3.0|Good movie.  On one of my all time great movies.  ewan mcgregor is a great actor.  The fantasy was great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is captivating! Love the pathos! The finale is shocking and heartbreaking however...I certainly hope they plan to continue this Masterpiece!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very good book, like so many others i totally enjoyed reading it. It was written very well
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I love pixar movies. I think its amazing that a movie with so very few words spoken still creates an understanding of each character's personality!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love the star wars saga.  I grew up on the movies and love the characters.  I do have to say I like the original better than the new trilogy.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|Simple cover for the Kindle Fire.  It doesn't stand up, like some of the others, but it works well for my needs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very good book, like so many others i totally enjoyed reading it. It was written very well
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is the first time I have ever taken the time to rate a book. Simply put one of the greatest stories stories I have ever read.<br /><br />Thank You
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Great movie to own.  Especially in hd.  All the suspense and drama that is in it. the imagination is wild
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This is very good movie. Vert good story line, great acting and enjoyable. Eastwood keeps going strong and gets it done.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|It's not giving any thing away to say that you know almost before starting this book that it will end tragically. So I struggled through with a sense of dread behind every page. The prose itself is beautiful and very lyrical but the subject matter is tough to swallow. If you are prepared it's a really special journey.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was expecting a lot from this book, what with it's high rating and all, and I got what I expected and more.  Definitely worth picking up.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Good movie.  It did not have too many flaws.  I wish they had more of michael corvinus in this one.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|If you liked Howard Zinn's \\"A Peoples History of the United States,\\" you will love this book.  It is a refreshing, truthful look at recent American History, unafraid of alternate views of conventional narratives.  The cold war, unconditional surrender, Hiroshima & Nagasaki, the iron curtain, and more are viewed through a different, perhaps more accurate lens.  The authors are critical of both Democratic and Republican post war  administrations from Truman to Obama and are unafraid to consider counter factual outcomes.  This is a must read for anyone interested in America's role in world history.
0307990850|5.0|Every Reacher my wife and I have ever read is one which is hard to put down. He`s a different kind of hero!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So far love this, it is fun. We use the timed one's for competitions with the kids. It gets them off the video games for a while. And we all like it.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|It was a great movie.  I love the mystery, the action, and the suspense.  Fully recommend this movie to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A really great game to play, especially for adults. It has great,clear vision and is not glitchy at all. It is byfar the best game I have played,and kind of like Temple Run!
B00005U11Z|4.0|I could only bring myself to give this four stars because it's not Steve Perry. But Wow, Steve Augeri is pretty darn close! Great stage presence and a hell of a voice. And the band really gets down and jams. Nicely done!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Seems to work as advertised. The operating temps of my CPUs are about 5 degrees C lower with this paste.
B005LAIH5O|5.0|There really is not much to say.  It is a blu ray movie and it came on time.  I love the greek mythology in it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it could use some improvements... what are the differences between the people? why cant I see my stats for every run or top ten at least? what about competeing with my son giving him his own stats on the same game.  why are all the runners stats combined?  maybe give the game a choice to play levels or continuous running would be cool too. these mode would make the game even better in my opinion. it is good but why not make it great?  :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is totaly awesome it is hard but fun I think everyone should have this app. Trust me you will like it.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|I have 3 desk top computers, custom built Thermaltake tall tower, HP mid tower and HP i3 short tower. This CPU fan is so big that it did not fit in any of my cases and I would have to perform major construction to make the motherboards strong enough to hold this fan sideways.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love it that I have all 8 movies especially in blu ray.  I am still watching them.  Great adaptation to the book.
1442359315|5.0|I ordered this book on a set of CDs, read by the author because I knew my husband would also love it, but doesn't take the time to read.  We listened to it together, speechless most of the time. It is awe-inspiring and often brings goose bumps and even a few tears. Even though I already believed in life after this life, the author's true account of his experience will touch you so deeply, and forever change the way you feel about life and death.  A MUST READ! Also makes a wonderful gift for those who are grieving the loss of a loved one!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its amazing and all butt i played 2games of it and got off when i wantedto play it later it opened to the first page played th music then it kicked me out!!!!!!! im very frustrated so i hope i can now get on after this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I Love this game. Very addictive!! I have a hard time putting it down. Its a very active game, I highly recommend it!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I love the movie so much.  It was the best movie so far I have ever seen.  It came the last day it said it would but what ever
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|Another great album from Neil Young & Crazy Horse. I am the type of listener that likes, no, loves the 18+ minute tracks full of instrumental mastery. This album is pure joy for me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just started using the Calculator Plus  and it is so handy to have it on your Kindle Fire without having to add something else to carry with you.  I know I will get a lot of use out of having it on my Fire because I always have my Fire with me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is version 2 and its just as great as the first one. I love it. Its harder and more tricky but its highly addictive!!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I am not sure why they did not release the full soundtrack to this movie. I already own the original broadway soundtrack on CD and the original London cast on vinyl. This CD was missing quite a few great songs. Also, the editing was very poorly done, the breaks between some of the songs are not quite synced properly.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This alarm is very LOUD and good for anyone who has trouble waking up to traditional alarm the only con is that it burns A LOT of battery to run it and if you don't leave your kindle on the alarm app then it will not go off.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the game.  There is one major glitch that I'm hoping they correct soon, or else it won't be worth playing for long.  The glitch is that nearly every time I use a continue gem, the game freezes and I have to reboot it.  This causes me to lose my coins earned that game, already lost 1 high score round cause of it, and steals your continue gems as well.  Very frustrating, especially when there are goals to use the continue gems, and it won't let you.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love Pac Man! This a great game. I played it when I was a kid. You only get 2 levels and then u have to buy full version. But I love it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Does everything it says and more.<br /><br />the ability to download other sounds is a great feature.<br /><br />The clock nightlight is great for when you are traveling as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a game all about not getting caught. It is a game like a mini temple run and is awesome
B00992CF6W|2.0|It deleted everything I ever made... I don't know what happened but everythings gone... But other than that, great game. Id buy.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|Don't know what I expected going in but this book hopped around like a flea on a griddle. Most of it made zero sense. Granted, I'm dyslexic and marginally autistic (which should be an advantage understanding this guy's topsy-turvy logic) but even with a brain that's hard-wired upside down and backwards I couldn't make hide nor hair of this nonsense.If you want to be a better cook, get out to the kitchen and experiment until something edible results - don't spend your money on this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|dude this is boss I wish you would've made it 6.0 cause that has freaking boss armorial but still pretty cool
B000YKG5L4|5.0|I reccomend this album to all One republic fans! If you haven't been introduced to One Republic, this is the place to start!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you enjoyed the first you will love this one too.<br />I looked forward to all the love story characters and how things turned out for them.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like the app but  it took me a couple of days to figure out how to set the alarm.
B004DM0UII|4.0|it carries tons of genres. The only complaint I have is that the interface is not user friendly. I am sure further updates will resolve. I use the app daily.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun I unlocked Lucy and she is amazingly fast the missions are do super fun if you have only a couple points use a jetpack and if you can't finish your mission use a boost to skip it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great read.  Really enjoyed. Was looking forward for the whole book as to what the world would be like had Kennedy lived.  Was shocked, but pleased because it fit the story better than I imagined
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I don't feel it's user friendly. I'd like to remove the app all together. Also, I don't like games that ask you to pay to play when they're suppose to be free.
B00992CF6W|1.0|l am so mad because my cousin's was updated and mine wasn't and now I can't play with him I demand a update
B00005JNNZ|5.0|I wish all teachers/coaches were involved and concerned about their students/players as coach carter was....great educational movie to share with your children
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Gave my coworker this CD since she likes Adele and she loves it.  There is even a version of &#34;Love Song&#34; on there that I didn't know she covered!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fantastic. Both granddaughters (8 and 4) love it and so do I.It is a bit of a challenge but that is why I like it.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Simple, easy, no frills.  If you just need a quick calculator, it's great to have handy. Easier to use than my phone.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I play this game all the time. Funny because you are being chased by a cop and a dog but not for little kids. Bad influence. :-/
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I never herd of the group, but I find the whole CD to be very entertaining and worth listening too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't take my Kindle everywhere I go, but I always have my android with me. When the oppurtunity arises I can always read which makes the time go by faster. I love to read and being able to read anytime I get the chance is great just like the Kindle for Android app.
B000GOUMPI|2.0|As a long-time fan of books as movies, I prefer them to have some input from the author. Kubrick just &#34;loosely-based&#34; his film on King's extraordinary novel. I kept feeling like Kubrick's version was too predictable. Despite camera tricks (perception, spatiality, patterns), a few special effects, etc, there was not the pull of terror I had reading the book.<br /><br />The actors were okay. Jack Nicholson has natural facial expression that make him appear evil, while Shelly Duvall is mousy and plays her role in a very vanilla way. Only in the climax scene in the bathroom, does she show emotion worthy of someone in her situation. While this version has that avant guarde feeling Kubrick enjoyed. I would rather stick to the re-make done in the nineties as a miniseries. My reasoning - it takes place in Colorado, uses the Stanley Hotel (where King wrote the story and based the Overlook on), and King himself worked on it. The miniseries is better juxtaposed next to the book than Kubrick's, but that's just my opinion.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Informative, accurate, and appealing to the eye. An app I would definitely recommend to others. There is an ease that comes with the use of such a well thought out product.
0765325950|5.0|I have to say I always worried about the day that I finished the last book.  After all these years of analyzing and examining every thread, I figured that the ending would never live up to the hype in my head of what I thought it should be.  To be honest, nothing could have lived up to what I had worked out in my head, but this was close.  I cant imagine a better way to end the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first. I thought maybe it was for a younger reader. But once I got into the core, it was captivating.  I read it in a day and a half.  I couldn't put it down.  This  is my  my first book by Hoover and it won't be my last. Awesome story that kept me wanting to keep turning the pages.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This episode maintained the quality of the series, and added the element of surprise.  Well done as always, with excellent performances by the cast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS!it's all I usually play I always stay up and wait for the new challenges or words.earning prizes is so fun collecting coin is my favorite.the people are so creative
B00B0NDF26|1.0|This was a big disappointment. I really expected better. It like a one hit wonder from the 80s tried to make a comeback.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Fun way to pass the time.<br />My grandchildren like to games on grandmas Kindle.<br />A good price for a entertaining game.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app allows you to follow the news with an intuitive design. Whatever you are looking for regarding news it can be found here. Must have!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This the best game ever I am speechless no other game even comes close to this please get this game you will like it
B004SBX112|5.0|great game. always something new coming out each season. grandma likes this game as well as the kids. would recommend to everyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so cool!! awesome graphics,exhilarating,and totally fun. it gets my adrenalin pumping and then I'm totally in the zone! I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys lots of action. enjoy!!!!
B001UU0XWE|5.0|This is a wonderful, mesmerizing story with great characters and beautiful picture and sound on my Kindle fire 7\\" hd.<br />  I\\"m into the 2nd season and each episode is amazing.  Anna Torv is a really fine and beautiful actress.  All the characters are entertaining and delightful.<br />  I'll be looking at all the \\"seasons\\" of Fringe!!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch never disappoints. His books leave you wanting<br /> More.  Books can change lives and I try to gift books that can help do that very thing!  I am waiting for your next one so write fast!!!<br /><br />  Joy
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I had every intention of reading this before the movie/musical, but I haven't yet.  Once it's complete I will put a better review.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game of is fun and addicting love the characters so much fun<br />Different board wish music was different.
0765325950|4.0|I won't go on and on in this review with specifics or spoilers.  As a long time fan and active member of the fandom, I have to say I found the book satisfying as far as being an ending to the series.  Sure there are some things I would like to have seen, but the book brings everything to a logical and satisfying conclusion and for a book being ended by someone who didn't start out writing it -- I'm really happy!  Thank you Brandon Sanderson for bringing your talent to this project and giving us the ending we all so greatly desired.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a pretty good app. The only sad part is that you have to get the upgrade to be able to use music you actually like. Besides that, it is an awesome app and does what it is supposed to do :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best mine craft game ever! The survival mode is pretty hard. But creative mode is the best. I even created 15 underground houses (and one of them is a mansion)! This game is awesome!!!!!  :)
B00355L2TU|3.0|kinda borin but effective. only tried one so far. It is good for beginners. very easy to use. Needs better music
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Absolutely amazing...it defiantly makes you appreciate your time on earth with your loved ones. Mitch Albom has a true gift for words.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|We first saw BSR as the opening act for Kenny Loggins -- however we already knew their songs because my husband downloaded them!  They are amazing together -- their voices blend beautifully; their lyrics are poetic and speak to my heart and soul -- The CD is amazing!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|With some real junk on television nowadays its great to see a show you just cant shut off or walk away from.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My son loves this game!  His only frustration is that we don't have internet at home, and this game (for some reason) needs to have a wireless connection each time you play it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very fun and inventive.  Excellent port over to the android platform.  here additional six words of review
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I read a lot of books but this one I just couldn't put it down. Definitely a page turner. It's the first book I've read by this author, but I will definitely read more of his books.  He knows how to write a story!!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is great for any age. I babysit a 4 year old and he loves it as much as me! Super cute graphics and endless playability. I have this on kindle fire hd and its looks great, definitely buy this game!
0439023521|5.0|I wanted to read and buy this book for a while and I've finally have my hands on it! I'll enjoy it like everyone else who have.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I've read this book so many times over the years that I have lost count.  Exciting, funny and at times quite sad, this poignant story of the trials of a group of rabbits in search of the perfect place to live will embed itself in your memory.  Full of wit, action and even some rabbity mysticism, I cannot begin to recommend it enough to people of all ages.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|When you try to record a song if there's a quiet part it'll start a new track. Some songs will show 4 or 5 tracks. It's ridiculous. The old software had a button to click to start a new track but the new doesn't. And if you go to frequently asked questions they admit that the software is not perfected yet, but they offer no alternative.<br /><br />And there customer support is non-existent. If you just need it for the turntable it'll do but don't expect to record old albums. You'll be very disappointed.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This was a surprisingly good movie. I had heard very little about it but for 5 bucks- it's a great deal.
0345803485|5.0|I haven't started reading the book yet but I've heard many great things about it. I'm excited to start reading it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so fun! Same concept as the first one,  but you can ride mine carts, collect gems, and run from one huge monster. I think the graphics are better on this one as well. Long live temple run 2,  and my there be many more! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 (:
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I read the Frank Miller graphic novel several years ago and, like many, was very impressed. The only criticism I had of that is the same one I have of this, which is the very ending. It still doesn't feel right.<br /><br />WARNING! This is NOT for kids. This is a very violent and mature animated film, very dark and disturbing. Not a criticism, but for any parents thinking this is going to be like most superhero cartoons, you are in for a surprise.<br /><br />This is part two of The Dark Knight Returns, but in itself is two films, or two stories.<br /><br />The first story is about the Joker. It is creepy. It is very well done. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I was mesmerized. The Joker makes up for lost time and goes on an epic killing spree and this film pulls few punches. The final showdown between Batman and the Joker is appropriately toe to toe.<br /><br />The second story is about Superman. This is even more epic. Superman is by this time simply a soldier following orders. He is told to fight the Russians. He does that in devastating fashion. He is eventually told to get Batman and put a stop to his brand of street justice.<br /><br />This leads to the final showdown. It is more than worth the wait.<br /><br />To me, this is the best animated superhero film I've seen.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I work for one the largetest IT companies on the planet. Anyone that reads about the perpetual revolution that began in the Valley, in the garages of genius, and see Jobs' rise as well as the entire revolution's rise and can not appreciate true American innovation needs to stick with ditch diggin. The visions of these pioneers/enginers/marketing and management innovators of that era and the unbelievable impact is has today and will have well into the future, should be commended on everylevel at every chance we have.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a great game. I really enjoy it. I recommend that other people try it. I could play it all day
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So far this is a great game. The two things I want them to add is to sell the emeralds for coins, and bring back invisibility power-up. Recommend for all ages.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The art of the scenes and clothes are top-notch quality and I love watching the show every week.  The episode that included the birth of a baby and subsequent death of Sybil was emotional, and I found myself crying over the bittersweet moment of a beginning of a life and also the end of another.  My one little dislike of the show is the focus on Mr. Bates.  It is just a tad unbelieveable (in writing terms) that one person could be accused of so many false charges and go through as much as he does.  Also, he never gets upset???  I would be one raging howling lunatic to be the so-called innocent in a series of accusations.  Maybe the writers have him calm and passive because he really is guilty and is fooling everyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best series I have read in such a long time. So captivating, you just can't put the book down until you've finished it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great love story with twists and turns around every corner. Can't wait for the next one, May can't get here soon enough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can·T wait see this in movie form it was a great reading  would recommend to all to read  so glad have gotten my kindle cause Don·t think would of red
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was never into temple run the original,  but I love this game, it's really addicting, and because  you only work on three achievements at a , it make the game  last longer. Good Job.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|a good movie from start To Finish lots of good action In it Can not wait for the next avengers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it changes your theme every month and has a special person for that theme it's great!!!!! #1
0765325950|5.0|Was the twenty two year wait worth this book as it's concluding volume?<br /><br />Damn skippy it was.<br /><br />Hands down, this is the best book in the series. Yes there were some places that stalled or that I disagreed with, but this book made me laugh out loud, scream in absolute joy and surprise, and weep for losses I did not even realize would take me there. This book tore my heart out.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan for beginning this journey. Thank you Brandon Sanderson for ending it so well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it its awesome. realistic. wouldn't change anything. need more gems Haha. addicting.  what a good game. add me. love this game.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|I am a grandma and I watch it without the my grandson, it is just a fun movie with lots of laughs and fun music. I never get tired of it!
B007ZKY7XO|2.0|After enjoying their first few albums, appreciating interesting melodies, harmonies and lyrics, I bought this expecting to want to dance. I found this disappointing. &#34;Baby Come Home&#34; and &#34;Only The Horses&#34; are up-beat and easy on the ears. &#34;The Secret Life of Letters&#34; has lyrics that are thoughtful similies. But the rest - especially the 'Bonus Tracks' - grate on the nerves. Suddenly they want to be a rap group? Annoying. And I was tired of whatever a &#34;kiki&#34; is, even before this CD arrived on my doorstep. Doubt this one will spend much time in the car with me.
B008B92U32|3.0|The original Fire does not have a camera. So it may be fun app, but will not work on our Fires.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The third book of the series is fantastic and continues to accelerate the adventure with additional turns and twists (most of which are unexpected).  I immediately went out and downloaded books 4 and 5.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A satisfying end to a very entertaining trilogy! Written for teens but enjoyed by adults.  Well written with many twists.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this book.  It drew me in from the first, and I couldn't put it down.  It is a quest, a treasure hunt, a puzzle--but extremely hip and cool as well, with today's high-tech world figuring prominently.  I can't wait for the next Sloan book.
B00B19DMUE|2.0|Although I tend to enjoy this genre of movie, The Possession just didn't do it for me.  I didn't find myself caring very much about the characters, and I didn't find it particularly suspenseful.  There were few surprises--everything exciting from the movie was included on the trailer.  The only thing that was even slightly creepy was all the big moths that fluttered throughout the film, and that only creeped me out because I happen to have a moth phobia.  Mostly, though, I was just waiting for it to end.  Sorry.
B00992CF6W|5.0|they should make it for kindle now because i don't know when they are going to make it because it already came out for ipod.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Zombieland isn't just a movie, it's a way of life. It provides you with a few of the general guidelines you should follow to survive a zombie apocalypse. Always remember, double tap!<br /><br />This is by no means your typical scary movie. I'd dare say there's only one or two parts that could even be considered the least bit scary. Zombieland is geared more towards the adventure of zombies rather than the \\"How can I get away from them\\" approach (Walking Dead). The characters are known by the cities where they came from and how they got into their current predicament.<br /><br />The movie culminates in a trip to a Disneyland type theme park. The rides and noise attract every zombie for miles, leaving the heroes in a last stand situation where only one group is coming out alive (so to speak), zombies or humans. It is definitely the most action packed scene in the entire movie.<br /><br />Witty dialogue, great actors, and a low budget type feel made this movie the sleeper hit of our time. I'm not ashamed to say I've watched it at least 5 times and will probably watch it a few more simply due to its greatness.
B004UO4AYE|1.0|The title is misleading. \\"Speak German\\" It gives the idea that with this book you will speak German. Wrong! It doesn't help to learn to speak German, you must speak German to read this book. That is why the title says German Edition. I couldn't read it because I don't speak German. If you need to improve or learn to speak German do not buy this book, although it is free.
B0025T6EY0|4.0|I enjoyed Season 2 even more than Season 1.  I watched it all in a single weekend!  The characters were developed a bit more and seemed a little less predictable to me.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Actually found this to be useless. Did nothing more than what I already had on Kindle. Waste of $2. Do not recommend.

0385535147|2.0|I have read a few Grisham novels and consider him a total guilty pleasure of mine. Sometimes you just want a good mystery - a page turner. But it appears he is losing his knack for such pleasurable novels.<br /><br />This book was so mediocre. The story pokes along, the characters are hard to believe, and there are so many holes in the story. Definitely not his best work.<br /><br />I see that many reviewers talk about how the beginning of the book was so good. For me it was the opposite, I kept waiting for something to happen... and finally over half way through the book it does, and I'm thinking, that's it!?<br /><br />Towards the end of the book there are two letters he writes to the FBI and the last one he writes could be the most unbelievable just plain awful writing I've read in any book, ever.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This series is a hit.  Awesome writing, comedy, suspense, it has it all.  Dexter is smarter than Sherlock Holmes.  I am buying them all.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|Bob's latest is sometimes overtly gravelly.  Several selections are way too long and melodies are relentlessly repetitive.  The album is difficult to listen to casually and a careful, thoughtful listen is exhausting.  That said, I still like it!
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|We watched Idol and rooted for Phil the whole way.  We bought this for Home, which is really a fantastic song.  The rest of the album is growing on us and there are maybe 2 other songs  that stand out, otherwise, it's pleasant but mainly background music.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I always like to read the book before I watch a movie.  This is one time I wish I hadn't.  I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more had I watched it first.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellence continues in season 3.  You either know what I mean or you don't.  Check it out before the 'spoilers' start telling you.

B007HACDLK|4.0|I love Mitch  I would like have a little more about Mich and his personal life.  Especially since his wife was murdered.  I would recommend these books to people who love spies and get the job done.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love this app. its perfect. it gives u the time, date, city and the degrees is bold and clear to see. also it gives u the real feel (what it feels like). i really like this app. its quick and easy to use.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Even though my granddaughter already enjoyed Melissa & Doug Sticker Pads, the reusable sticker pad is a great improvement. They are much easier to position.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|Just as the stunts in this movie defy logic, so do the plot and the characters motivations. Based off of the comic Mark Millar and J.G. Jones the movie makes little sense in and of itself (which is probably due to the fact it doesn't follow the comic much at all, it takes \\"artistic liberties\\" to new heights!), but none-the-less is enjoyable.<br /><br />  The movie starts off briefly explaining the fraternity, and shows the death of one of its members and then quickly shows us the lead character Wesley (played by James Macavoy) explaining to us why his life sucks.  His girlfriend is a b****, his best friend is a jerk, and his boss Janice constantly induces his anxiety attacks.  While purchasing his anxiety medication he is confronted by a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who claims that someone is trying to kill him, and then in the middle of the store engages in a gun fight, and takes Wesley on an insane car chase.  He is brought to the fraternity head quarters and told that his father was a member and that Wesley's destiny is also to be in the fraternity as well.<br /><br />  This movie has excessive amounts of profanity, and although it does not cite this in the most reviews I saw, some nudity (You see a dudes butt in the beginning part of the film, I love how male nudity is rarely considered nudity unless it is frontal).  The violence is also excessive, but it is not on caliber with a horror film in that it does not show explicit details.  It primarily has a lot of blood splatter shots, and no real detail like brains or disembowelments.<br /><br />  The acting is as good as you can expect it to be in this type of movie since the twists the plot takes make no sense, nor do the choices of the characters make any sense. It is the wish-fulfillment qualities of this movie; such as cussing out your b***** boss and smacking your a**hole friend with a keyboard that makes it truly satisfying.  The action is first rate, and as long as you are not bothered by excessive profanity and violence this is an enjoyable film.  Just do not think too much or the whole movie will unravel, this isn't the type of movie that has to make sense, it is merely here for wish-fulfillment and eye candy, both in visual effects and Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />  God bless ~Amyanity and violence this is an enjoyable film.  Just do not think too much or the whole movie will unravel, this isn't the type of movie that has to make sense, it is merely here for wish-fulfillment and eye candy, both in visual effects and Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />  God bless ~Amy
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I have not finished this book yet.  But up to the point I am at right now WOW  can't wait to see how it ends.  You can feel the pain of all the people who is  envolved.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I am not a person who gives book reviews.  Actually, this is my very first one. After logging onto Amazon and seeing \\"Hopeless\\" by Colleen Hoover listed as the number 4 best seller, I felt I had to write my VERY first review.<br /><br />I was skeptical about the quality of writing after reading the free sample. I thought perhaps the book would get better as the characters developed.  I was wrong.<br />The first part of the book was decently written. It gave great insight into the mind of the main character. However, that didn't last long.  \\"Let down\\" was the feeling I got midway through the book.  It was brought on by the abrupt change of pace, random interactions with classmates and too many dramatic twists.  Needless to say I skimmed through the last couple of chapters to just get it over with.<br /><br />Lesson learned....listen to my instincts.
B000AJIF4E|1.0|I bought it August 19th, use it 40 times by half hour, earpad was torn. When I removed it, there is some paper which was torn too. I threw it in garbage can. I do not have time to ask Sony, seller or any other to fix it or replace it.

B0010T3UUC|2.0|I love crocs.  I have been wearing them for about 7+ years now.  I have owned many models and colors.  These are the worst ones I have ever worn.  They are too tight across my foot and I purchased the size that I always wear.  Since there are no holes in them, they make your feet sweat.  Also, it is hard to get them off because your feet suction into them.  I will be returning them and buying a different model.
B0071NLG0W|5.0|I love romance ,comedy, and suspense not to mention a series.This definitely was worth the read!!! Any fans of Janet Evanovich would definitely luv this
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good story that really pulls you in to care for most of the characters.<br />I really think the last chapter was what people should concentrate on, however.  Think about all the heartache and pain that could be avoided with good communication.  Both in politics and in personal lives.
B000FC1KBG|3.0|I liked some of her ideas especially the ideas that babies have different types of cries. I also liked how she showed that babies display different body language to get each one of their needs met. It was insightful at times. Of course there are things that I don't agree with but it's always good to have different ideas and perspectives on things. It gave me more ideas on how to get to know my baby better and how to observe her and better meet her needs.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE this app but I want the new update for the kindle!! My kindle is the right version but it's not updating!!!

1451695195|4.0|Gosh, I had no idea about the furor about this book.  Saw it at the library, and picked it up.  Read it in about two hours.<br />I have had experiences with out of body stuff, and a grandmother who had an NDE, so not new to it.  Wanted to hear a neurologist's view.  Would have liked some stuff about the latest studies in Sweden (Switzerland?  Somewhere there),  where they probed the brains of subjects and they had out of body experiences when this happened.  Nothing.<br /><br />I thought this book was more about his life than the NDE, which disappointed me  a little, but was important to a certain degree for us to learn about his non believing, scientific beliefs.  The fact that he was adopted was an enormous part of the story at the end, although obviously didn't realize it while I was reading.  I wanted to hear more about the \\"other place,\\" and why we are here, etc. I wanted some answers. But the two things that really got me were the \\"murmuring\\" which turned out to be prayers, and the reason why his adoptive father did not meet him, but somebody else did.<br /><br />My husband has Stage IV cancer, and we are not Christians.  He had six months to live.  They were doing one more surgery.  Our surgeon told us to pray for him, when we asked what we could do to prepare my husband for the upcoming grueling (17-hour) life extending surgery.  So, if that was what the surgeon wanted, we would ask all our friends to pray, even though we didn't really believe in it.  All I can say is that the surgery was a miracle (due, probably, mostly to incredible surgeons willing to stand for 17 hours and not give up, but then again, who knows), but I loved the idea that the prayers were actually being heard.<br /><br />I loved how this book was not biased to any religion.  I love how he supposedly did not know anything about the \\"classic NDE,\\" writing it down first before he started to read other accounts.<br /><br />I liked it.  It moved me to tears.<br /><br />I KNOW there is a life after this.  You can negate that all you want, but those naysayers will find out eventually that it is true, and it's not Christian.  It's for everybody.<br /><br />No matter whether that he wrote it \\"to make money\\" or not, he has a non profit website to try and change the world and educate, and that's got to say something.  He's risking being a laughing stock among his scientific peers.  You have to be strong to do something like that, unless you really believe it and want to make a difference.<br /><br />So, read and be your own judge.after this.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I just detest how everything comes out on apple but then comes out on kindle, maybe six months later. it took me forever to get this app! also, I would gladly pay more for this app, to be able to craft everything you can on the Pc version.

B009CPE424|4.0|This was a cute movie to watch during our family move night. Appropriate and comedic. Our boys loved it! 4 Stars!
086571701X|2.0|The amount of real information in this book is rather few and far between. One of the final appendices sums up nearly the entire book's actual information in a handful of pages. The filler (anecdotal caveats and such) is not bad...but ultimately defeats any chance at a useful structure. &#34;Step-by-step&#34; is very misleading. The formatting is almost all endless prose- very few lists, diagrams, tables. And as a whole the treatment of aquaponics is very myopic, giving barely enough small bites of info to accomplish a small consumer sized production and nothing more. Leaving out really any abstract analysis, scientific thesis or expanded potentials.<br /><br />Turns out, if you're really into aquaponics the author is more than happy to recommend over-priced courses in aquaponics. These courses I can only assume include what the book should have been. Oddly enough, the author herself sells some of these courses on her website. Making this whole book all that much more disappointing.<br /><br />I would say the book could use a re-write but I believe the author's purpose was to be intentionally cutesy and barely informative. So my final conclusion of this book puts it in-between a weak diy instructional manual and an infomercial. Pathetic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a teat game and while it glitches a tad it is good overall! I love how you actually have to take care of the horse. however it is still very fun because there are games and competitions.
B009FREK3W|5.0|I would recommend this product to ANYONE! We watched the program and afterwards looked for this. Jeff Lynne is a GENIUS!
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|For me this is one of Pat Metheney's best albums, as far as I am concerned. It represents a particular time of my life when everything was magical. . Teamed with Lyle Mays, keyboards; Steve Rodby, acoustic and electric bass; Paul Wertico, Drums; Armando Marcal, percussion, voice; David Blamires, voice; and Mark Leford, voice. the music soars and inspires. Pat Metheny's guitar style flows. He has lately branched out into more esoteric and jazzy forays, but on this album he is at his best. The tracks Minuano (Six Eight), Third Wind are great (well all of the tracks are in their way but I am biased :).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I would play it 24/7 if I could my cousin and I are freaks about this game I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!!!!
B000BJ7C6K|5.0|Hare Krishna, right?! I guess I'm starting to like sitar music more as I get older and the opening from Ravi Shankar (RIP) is really cool. And Leon Russell playing \\"Jumping Jack Flash/Youngblood\\": When it came out in 1972 was probably the first time I'd heard of him. George was really good on all his songs. \\"Wah Wah\\" is one of my all time favorites. Billy Preston really rocked it for God on \\"That's the Way God Planned It\\". Dylan dragged a little, not too bad. A good buy, no doubt.<br />Hare Krishna ya'll!!
B003OZ7GVY|5.0|Transfers easily and arrived very speedily and is just as described in the product details.  Excellent price for excellent quality product.
030758836X|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book based on the hype. Biggest waste of money. The book just does not make any sense. I feel like the author,  had a clear beginning but no end. It was ridiculous. I didn't care for either character and couldn't care less if they were both stranded on a deserted island for eternity. They deserve each other. I hated the language and hated the misogyny. I wish I could get a refund.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great like temple run but so simple a 2-year-old can be great at it. It is great but the best endless running game remains temple run 2.

If I had a choice to pick this game, or anything else in the world, I would pick this specific game.<br /><br />  I hope you enjoy this game if you decide to buy it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Although my droid razr m offers several alarm clock options, their display fades away with the screen saver option. This alarm clock has the option to keep it on the screen indefinitely.The only requirement that the phone should be on the charger otherwise the battery  will be exhausted.  Anyhow this is a small price for having an alarm clock that displays the time overnight.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I get good entertainment from the reading app.  it fits my need and can download any kindle edition book.  I have fallen asleep to it more than once.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I can't edit anything in my profile on my Kindle, I am only able to edit my profile from my computer.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|You'd think this plot could go in a bad, cliche way, but it has enough heart and talent to elevate it to a really good and entertaining movie. Very funny performance from Rebel Wilson and Anna Kendrick, along with the guy that played her love interest (he has a really nice voice and sort of looks like a younger Dane Cook).
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|I like this case as an alternative to a hardshell model because there are times when this works out. When I need to pack it away, don't want anyone looking at it or messing with it, this is a great alternative. It fits the Kindle nicely, is soft and does not rub on the device, looks greats (although not as bright as the picture seems to indicate), and zips back and forth easily.<br /><br />I would not give up my normal case, but I like having this as an alternative.
0670023329|5.0|I can honestly say that I knew very little about North Korea prior to this other than their saber-rattling and the abject poverty of their people. Sadly, that is just the tip of the iceberg. The author gives us an insight into one extreme example of life in North Korea while also educating us about what life is like in much of the rest of North Korea. The book saddened me greatly as I thought about Shin's life and the life of those around him. It angered me as I thought of those in power who willingly participate in and promote these atrocities against other human beings. It educated me to the plight of the North Korean people. And it encouraged me to do something.<br /><br />Yesterday, I didn't really know much about North Korea. Today, I know more than I did before. Tomorrow, I bear the burden of the North Korean people in my heart and must seek to ease their burden.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Everything and anything at your fingertips - literally.  Recipes, crafts galore, health tips, cleaning solutions, holidays, patterns and designs - the list is endless!  The selection of FREE items is mind boggling and exciting.  I find Pinterest to be one of the most relaxing, yet rewarding activities on my Kindle and other online devices.
B008X9Z37A|2.0|I was disappointed in this case because it was one of the basic designs and I kind of expected it to hold up better than some of the more exotic. Granted, it is doing a decent job, still allowing me to carrying it out if I want and offering protection, but the insides feel loose and it does not make me trust it. Quality is alright, design is basic, mounting is easy. Still, I'm not sure I'd ever get another like this one because one of the straps is already coming loose. Considering that is what separates me from having to use my accidental drop insurance, it doesn't make me feel that good about it.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|Nice watch.  Been a while since I had an &#34;automatic&#34; vice &#34;electrical&#34; watch, but no issues. I will be interested in how long this very nice canvas strap keeps clean.  A great deal on a very good watch.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the way the plot was revealed (using the grand jury testimony) .  Although you started developing an idea as to whether Jacob was guilty or not, the ending became a surprise.  Usually I am pretty clear on how a story will end long before the finish but I was down to only less than 10% left (on my kindle) and still wasn't sure.  Gave it 4 stars as there were some repetitive areas that were not needed. A good read.
B001ILFUD2|2.0|I regret buying this dvd. It has some very cute parts and it has some ugly parts. I really don't want to explain to my daughter what happened to the bad guy when he got run over by a train or why those ugly dogs are trying to eat the girl and the nice dogs. I wish they made it more kid friendly.

But there are those days (not recently) where they end up in more than one piece and i just can't fix that...

B004SIPAJG|4.0|Scott Hastings, a young and talented Australian ballroom dancer, is wanting more than the usual steps that will win championships but doesn't challenge his ability or ambitions. Fran, a young woman with Spanish gypsy roots, has been secretly in love with Scott and suggests that he teach her his steps and get his shot at his life-long dream of winning the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship: his way and on his terms.<br /><br />Strictly Ballroom gives us a very familiar trope of a fairy tale with the method of direction and acting as counterbalances to what would easily have been a dull and forgettable film. It moves fast from the dance steps to the dialogue to the progression of the main leads, Scott and Fran. Its in-your-face cliches, chessiness and over the top performances by most of the cast throughout the whole of the movie, and at first, slightly off-putting but I stuck with it because there was something cheery and genuine about the performances and I liked the different, intriguing flavor on a story that is so very familiar. When I understood that the blatant stereotyping and gaudiness was on purpose, I began to appreciate the tongue-and-cheek-smartness of the script and the careful balance that Baz Luhrmann is so well known for. He really shoves it in your face, then backs off, giving us characters that aren't as cheesy or cliched as first presented but human and flawed, yearning for things lost and afraid of what could be. The most interesting and surprising part of this movie was the infusion of Spanish gypsy roots and dance that Scott eventually embraces, as well as the diverse musical score that kept the beat and liveliness that never waned.<br /><br />Paul Mercurio (Scott Hastings) and Tara Morice (Fran) aptly executed their roles. They clearly understood Luhrman's vision and intent, offering us the Luhrmann style while giving us characters with depth; two people we wanted to cheer on and smile when they succeeded. They are equals in their partnership, both on and off the ballroom, and their romance is so cute and enjoyable to watch. Overall, I was glad to find this gem and won't mind watching it again.nership, both on and off the ballroom, and their romance is so cute and enjoyable to watch.

B001AGXEAG|4.0|Tim Burton has been recognized already for years to be a master of black comedies with fantastical and weird elements. Beetlejuice is brightly colored early gem in that collection that has been bit forgotten behind darker, later masterpieces. The story itself is however very &#34;Burtonesque&#34; and feels to be close relative of Edward Scissorhands that has similarly abstract, colorful imagery and bit sad undertones behind otherwise brightly colored fantasy world.<br /><br />Here we have Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as newly-deceased lovely, naive couple who want to get rid of family that has settled in their old house - and their desperate attempts lead them to bio-exorcist Betelgeuze, who of course almost manages to wreck everything before bright, happy ending. The whole cast from happy couple to Michael Keaton's demented Betelgeuze to Winona Ryder's goth girl and annoyingly preppy Catherine O'hara seem bit unlikely selections in their roles but that makes them even more charming and fun. And the score of Danny Elfman fits the picture well together with sunny tunes of Harry Belafonte.<br /><br />It is rumoured that there will be sequel for Beetlejuice but I am not sure whether that is a good idea... maybe he should be left to wait in Underworld with his shrunken head and hope that nobody calls his name three times...

It was like watching it for the first time, the clarity,color ,sharpness, and the 5.1 dolby digital surround sound truly made this a entry, that deserves to be in you collection, as I\\"m very glad its it mine, I highly reccomend it to you.......
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it was first released but just recently purchased it. It is such a brutally beautiful film and so many reviews have been written about it that it seems silly to write yet another one. I'm glad Kate got the Oscar for her portrayal of Hanna.

We have all the right tensions between all the right characters (like sheriff vs. free-lancers, unexpected kind of witch). It starts with a familiar fairy tale, but doesn't try to change it (or not much). Instead, it adds new chapters at the end, and posits a bit of back-story before the traditional plot gets under way.<br /><br />Popcorn-worthy, but I probably won't remember details a week from now.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B004K9NWZC|5.0|Advent children is awesome. I love the clothes.The other one is good aswell; the graphics are awesome.<br />I recommend you buy it
B009MF5BXK|4.0|If you like action flicks this is for you. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
B005RYF5JA|5.0|i like this DVD it sounds so good thank you.i watched this on PBS it was so good i loved it
B003TXS5AC|1.0|I don't want to write a review directly on the musical contain of this album, which is really excellent, or about the double picture LP layout which is amazing, but simply about the sound, which is simply rotten. The cause is probably the mastering, it sounds like saturated 128kbs encoded mp3's!!! So, is it really serious to sell a record at this price simply for its beautiful artwork??... Of my opinion, it is an unforgivable fault.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awsome!!! It really a fun game to just sit downand relax and just play. This game really makes me happy when im sad
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I was not prepared for this, it was more than I expected. If you have't seen it, you will be glad you did,
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Loaded this game for my grandson to play when he visits, but find myself trying it occasionally. It's fun for kids.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can one possibly say for the best British TV series ever done. Especially don't miss 1 & 2 then get caught up with this one. I hear that that making another one.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad is my favorite show of all-time! Incredible writing and the most unique characters you will find anywhere.  This show is as addictive as Meth.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I liked the movie Cadillac Records because; I always enjoyed music of past generations because it teaches those watching the basic roots of our modern time. Cadillac Records captured the essence of that time and the musicians, who created it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy this game when I wait for a flight or in the doctor's office to make the waiting time pass.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Beautifully filmed, amazing actors, very well written, and chilling!  I love how Zachary Quinto creates a character with deep compassion one minute, followed by terrifying hatred the next.
B00A8V3VVG|3.0|I know, I know.  1 star is a little harsh for this amazing soundtrack.  In fact, I definitely recommend getting the physical CD even if you import it to iTunes the second you get it.  The case, liner notes, and poster (yes poster) with notes from QT are great.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I just opened up my copy to find that there was no CD inside! Instead, I got two copies of the poster. Obviously a fluke and not intentionally ripping me off, but that is unheard of.  The case was still shrink wrapped when received.  Will be returning for a REAL copy.  If anyone get's two CDs in their case, I'll give you my address...<br /><br />EDIT: Changed from 1 star to 3 stars.  Amazon customer service promptly sent another CD and a return label.  As far as the music is concerned, I think you should listen to the Amazon previews (or watch the film) to determine purchasing or not. I don't think someone should purchase music based on a written review of an individual's opinion.
B008B92U32|1.0|Did you ever notice when there's a 6 paragraph long review that gives an app 5 stars it covers every single feature? And the only negative thing mentioned would be &quot;if anything, there are way too many features in this app&quot;. Yeah, we are stupid.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Have been playing this game since I got a computer.  It's a good game to relax to and forget your daily problems.
B0038AUY96|5.0|I picked this up knowing that it would be a good read.<br />It tells the story of Harry holes quest to find Norways first serial killer.<br />Harry is a very unconventional hero in that he is an ex alcoholic that is not generally liked by the his piers.<br />The plot is sometimes slow and the book takes its time to get going but it is worth sticking with as the plot throws us many suspects and has lots of twists and turns.<br />Anyone who liked the girl with the dragon tattoo will like nesbos method of writing and story telling
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The idea is very, very simple: Build towers and bridges with flexible gooballs. There's a curious and interesting story that it manages to work into the concept, as well as levels that are mindbending without being overwhelming or seeming downright impossible. The music by the way, is -phenomenal-.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played it so fun people who don't like it have to think again my NO1 game
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Been hearing Black Keys on radio. Finally bought album. AMAZING! Great music from beginning to end. Would recommend this to everyone who's interested in their music!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Love it. It's great music. If you've heard Sigh No More, you'll love Babel as well. I love the distinct sound, mixing American and Irish Folk with a bit of Gospel and a touch of rock music. One of the most talented groups out there these days.
B0090YHSFC|2.0|Very simple concept that's amusing for a few levels, but then it just falls on its face and starts introducing 'premium' features that just don't fit. Played it once then didn't touch it ever again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game especially New York but Rio is good as well. I think it's great especially if bored and IT'S FREE
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Predictable.... but very good! I couldn't put it down.. it will make you cry. I loved the ending. He is an amazing writer that Nicholas sparks
B008HK3SFO|4.0|This sleeve fits my Nexus 7 perfectly with a little extra space for my earphones and/or my USB cord. I was actually debating between this or the smaller size Timbuk2 sleeve (XXS), and decided on this one specifically for the extra space. I was a little disappointed in the padding of the case, I thought there would be more, but I guess it helps keep the sleeve slim. The sleeve seems well made, although the material of the polka dot pattern feels a bit cheap. It would have been nice if it was the same material as the center white strip, which I thought it would be. It's hard to tell in the picture. Overall I'm happy with the sleeve.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|If you love British humor (and sitcom's) you must have John Cleese and &#34;Fawlty Towers.&#34;  All 12 original episodes with Cast Interviews and John Cleese commentaries.  3 Disc Set.  My favorite thing to watch when I need a good laugh! ~
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its a good game but I had to download it again to make work it is better then temple run 1
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book shows the professional maturation of the Navy Seals from when Richard Marcinko stood up Seal Team Six (Rogue Warrior-also a good read) to today's &#34;Best of the Best&#34; stealth warriors.  It also shows that combat is a lot more physical than playing in a professional football game, something that obviously was lost in the decision making process by the Obama administration and Congress when they decided to now put American women in harm's way.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book really relates to everyday life, it's amazing..<br />I would recommend  this book for sure, trust  me you won't be let down...
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like everything about this game.the tiles are awesome, there are many boards to choose from &amp; it keeps you occupied for hours!
B00846REIS|5.0|My English teacher told me it is a must read, and it is!! The relationship between the two is just phenomenal. I couldn't put my kindle down!
B00846REIS|4.0|I choose to rate this book a 4 star because it was an excellent book although there were some things I didn't like. I love the book for its amazingly crazy, exotic, intense relationship between Eva and Gideon. I can't get enough about learning there past and seeing how they get through it. I'm really not a fan about all the sex scenes although they aren't to long, they are very detailed and there's a lot of them. I don't mind them but I'd rather just continue learning about there pasts and the nonsexual side to there relationship which I feel is such a little part of the book. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey trilogy.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Sense the time of the original series fans have looked for the whimsey of Tom Baker and the fun of going for a ride in a police box that can travel threw time, this show continues to deliver with the newest in the line of series doctors. If you like science fiction the whole family can share, you will love this.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I saw the tv series and it moved me, the books are just as compelling and worth every second couldn't put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is good because it teaches u how to ride a horse<br /> Also I like this game
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Maybe I am just not into the game any longer, but I do not find it very challenging.<br />I guess there are too many other games available to choose from.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|Surprising movie, a truly unique mix of grief/loss along with a destructive & zany wild-card. Best movie I've seen in a while. I laughed, I cried, 5 stars!!!! :)
0316232955|5.0|rápida entrega sin problemas, objeto llega impecable, en un emboltorio que lo libro de descuidos, el pago fue exitoso<br />gracias
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get any material and make the building at least 30 block high and make it 7 blocks out and make the rouf 4 blocks high and dont put torches in it and make a hole at least 2blocks  aloong  and 5 blocks long
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you enjoy watching the drama of Downton Abbey unfold on PBS, you will definitely enjoy owning your own copy of this show.  The story-line is quite interesting but I am gaining a better understanding of the culture and history involved.  The dvd extra's are very good.
B00003CXDD|5.0|A fun tale of Adventure about a young wizard wannabe and father (from a small race of people) and his quest to save a magical child princess from an evil witch queen.  Very entertaining!  Also stars Val Kilmer and has a small (hee-hee) part by Billy Barty.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|As a music enthuisast this was a good addition to my CD collection. Great beat and encompasses most of Pitbull's recent music. Definitely a keeper.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I luv the game but I can't find out how to update it for kindle fire but other than that  its really good
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|When I purchased tix to see Kenny Loggins last summer, BSR was his opening act.I said to myself, I dont want to hear his new music, I want his old stuff. Well I can now tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. This trio sound great. Georgia's voice is so distinct. Gary has that kind of voice that just speaks to you. Together with Kenny (the best singer/songwriter in my opinion)they are explosive. The cd is addictive. Even when I am not playing it, I hear it in my mind. The harmonies of these 3 is simply put \\"FABULOUS\\". I already want another CD. Their music is for the young, the old and the ones who are searching for new and good music. My hats off to BLUE SKY RIDERS - My Rock Stars!!!!
B00000JPH6|5.0|Terrific fantasy-story from the Henson mindgarden! Wonderful and whimsical puppetry (Muppetry), that charmed my children when they were young and sure to delight your kids too!  &#34;Bad&#34; guys not too scary either!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|found this to be another boring game. glad it was free.<br />deleted it from my kindle in a big hurry.
0061547840|5.0|It is a great book. Valious tips for everyone. A lesson of life and living. Of course, How can you think bigger and better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So far I'm in love with them game. It's harder than before and much more fun. You should definetly get this you won't been disappointed.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I loved how the item was packaged. It was on time, Also a great Tv show I would highly suggest you get this show.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Beautifully written. Great story!  Having 2 children adopted fro a foreign country myself, I found this book fascinating! Strongly recommend!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Most coolest game ever full of many hard but easy obstacles and cool game especially the neon green color totally fashion or my style
0679420266|5.0|While barely over a hundred pages in length, there is no end to the depth pulled from the soul of Camus's intensely strung and largely lauded masterpiece, `The Stranger'.  With towering power and a conundrum of ambiguous nature, Camus weaves such a beautifully orchestrated character study that studies more than the mere character of one man but the character of society and, in the end, the character of character itself.  Yes, without saying much at all, `The Stranger' says more than most by asking the right questions and underscoring the right themes.<br /><br />The basic plot is rather simple.  A young man, living in France, wanders aimlessly in his own life, almost entirely complacent in his own apparent apathy until a relationship with a violent neighbor puts the young man in a perilous situation.  When faced with fear and blinding light (the sun), poor decisions are made in haste and soon our protagonist is standing over the dead body of an Arab.  He is arrested and tried and ultimately sentenced to death.  It is in these final moments, the last ten pages or so, that the whole story comes to completion and we can see the soul of what Camus was trying (successfully so) to enliven for the reader.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Camus spins a web of questions that shed light on the protagonist's situation and the complexities that lie in deciding his guilt.  I think that is what makes this novel so profound and so respected.  It manages to speak to the heart and soul of all who read it because it dissects injustice in a way that is less manipulative and more intimate.  As the story comes to a close (the finale being an open end) all that came before it makes more sense, especially in the development of Meursault (our narrator), a man who was devoid of emotion and suffered the consequence of such self-denial.<br /><br />Now, many have gripped as to the translation.  Ward's is the only translation that I have read, but I hear that this is inferior and in reading some of the side by side comparisons to Gilbert's translation, I can see why many are upset with this.  Gilbert's translation seems far more full bodied and even feels like a completely different book in some parts, which is striking and somewhat sad.  The translations should NOT differ so much as to completely change to structure of a sentence, and yet that seems to be the case here.  I want to read Gilbert's translation now.  Still, this story is sensational and from the eyes of a first time reader, Ward's version was just fine.e of the side by side comparisons to Gilbert's translation, I can see why many are upset with this.

B009HEMF1M|5.0|This movie was a surprise to me and now it is one of my favorites.  The comedic timing is fantastic and all of the characters bring the story to life.  One of my favorites.
B00APPJELG|5.0|Like most of the free world, I love Downton Abbey.  I love PBS, always have.  This program just leaves me begging for more.<br />I went through all of the eipsodes of season 3 for most of a full day, and now can't wait for the next season, and there had better be one!!!!  Maggie Smith, as well as all the major players, are superb.  I firmly believe this program is so popular, due to the fact, there is so little quality programs being produced these days, one's that don't involve sorid explicit depraved acts, violence, language, etc.  I and apparantely many more, crave a show with class, about class and what it means to have class.<br />Manners and class in my humble opinion, went out the window decades ago.<br />I'm just saying, but long live Downton Abbey and Maggie Smith.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I played it only once.  I found it a little boring and slow.  Could not see the point of it all.  Maybe if I played it again, I may like it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read this on my smart phone and it was easy reading.  Would purchase further books and read on my smart phone.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|Really a very complete book, where the author shares in a very practical way how to read and understand body language. Real life examples also provide a great explanation on how to read people reactions. I really enjoyed it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked how Sparks made the characters a bit more complex in regard to their individual lives. Gave things a nice twist.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action filled...reciting...suspenseful..I liked the story behind the games....it was a great read for all.  Can't wait for book 2. Will read again
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was always on my toes waiting for what was going to happen next. Couldn't put it down. Good read if you don't mind a little blood.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was one of Joss Whedon's more interesting ideas, a cross between science fiction and the old West where the good guys are actually bad guys.  The chemistry between the cast members worked marvelously and it's difficult to point to any one member and say that (s)he made the show great.  The sharp contrast in technology - blasters vs gunpowder, for example - made the concept interesting as did the contrast between the characters.  They also made the whole idea a lot more fun to watch.  It's too bad network executives couldn't handle the premise and killed the show with only 15 episodes being aired.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I liked this because it reminded me of the headlines and stories happening in the past, as well as looking at the future
B009VB97EY|1.0|I chosed this movie first because obviously i wanted to see this men dancing and stripping! Ok if isthat the only thing that you wanna see, but in general the movie has not story, no sence, no music no nothinh! The best part and the only worth it part of it is when they are dancing...
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Serenity was a wonderful wrap up to a series that was cut way too short unlike another Joss Whedon product that went a season or two too long, that being Buffy.  I would much rather have seen the series continue with the movie becoming part of the story arc rather than the end of it but one can't have everything.  As it is, I have the DVD and the video which I purchased separately to eventually download to my tablet.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this game was lots of fun. I did not want to stop. puzzles were not too easy or hard. I did have to use the hint a few times. very interesting story line. I recommend this game if you like hidden objects.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every chapter in this serie is amazing, i cant stop of watching it!<br /><br />Since the first season i have been adicted and noe this third season is even better!
030758836X|2.0|Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL was Not what I expected. I Didn't appreciate the language and there were no characters in the story to identify with.  Both main characters were severely flawed.  The general plot of a wife disappearing and the husband being suspect is interesting enough, but the conclusion was too disturbing and unrealistic. I was disappointed.
B003EY7JH6|4.0|thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Good introduction to Hari Seldon and his back story.  Would def recommend this book to any Foundation fan
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This game is the same a Mario which is ok because I like that game, but I got kind of bored with this one and a little frustrated with how the character responded to my directions
B00796E7CA|4.0|I enjoyed the tales in this book very much, more on a &#34;4 3/4 star&#34; level, but this &#34;e-version&#34; of the book through the Kindle application on an iPad suffers from some minor problems. Reading it wasn't difficult, but (like another book I recently purchased by Tolkien for the Kindle applications through iOS and Androird) things like spelling, links to footnotes and the general layout occasionally annoyed me. Since I had never read this book in physical form I decided to give it a try, but I think I'd have rather added hardcover editions of the books to my small library instead of the digital copy. The errors in this edition were slightly annoying, but it is quite possible that an actual Kindle may not have had the same problems.
B0064Z62R0|5.0|I always wanted to go to Hawaii and this movie shows a lot of what it might be like to live there.  I saw it last year in Lake Havasu City, AZ with my girlfriends and we all enjoyed it.  I then bought the CD.....Love the music.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great and simple, just the way I think game should be, easy to play and when you wan to quit you can and when you come back its in the same place you left off
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I really liked the product overall. It really does protect the kindle and it has a nice look. The one thing i did not like was that it really didnt hold the product up as advertised. It will stay up on its own but it falls if anything touches it. Plus it only works on hard services. But i really like everything else about it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Refreshing reminder that not all new music has to suck.  Great music to listen to whether you need to get hyped up or relax
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loves this game, she says it a lot better then the 1st, and easier to play on the Kindle vrs her iPod
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|At first the book intrigued me-well written story and good fantasy, but the end seems to be a Bollywood film-I mean Jace and Clary.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I absolutely love this case!!! I get maximum protection including it being waterproof without the bulk of an Otterbox!!! Totally worth every penny!!!
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|This book got great reviews so I decided to read it, not a big fan of nonfiction but it was ok. I thought the ending would be better but I felt disappointed
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The book is very interesting though, it keeps you intrigued all the time you're reading. Though in this one there isn't discovered anything about Jace and Clary's relationship.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'm speechless. Colleen Hoover is amazing. Thus book made me laugh, cry and think. These have to be some of my most favorite book characters!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I'm not sure what the big deal was about this book and when it was published, it was a good book but nothing special
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love it, can be very challenging. Enjoy the music, however would enjoy a different tune when a new level arrives.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a classic King novel. He has written some real duds over the last number of years, but this is not one of them.  One of the better books I have read in a long time.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter loves this game but is kind of bored of it she likes Temple Run 2 better now that its out
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was a cliff hanging leave you wanting more best seller it is so so so sovso! So good
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I got this game for my 4yr old son, and he likes it... I played it myself and the controls to move back and forth do not work that great... when I go to jump over something or go forward it kills me cause the button doesn't move me forward, so that is frustrating. If they could fix that, then I would love this game....
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The 1st book was ok, but after that I felt like it was the same thing over and over again, not into the whole submissive thing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a 'relay fun game I would recommend getting this game you won't want to put it down fun ways and hard it is a addicting game
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander completely succeeded in relaying his testimony that most undoubtedly he experienced with his heart and soul rather than his physical self. His story is traumatic, deeply intimate and gloriously poised to touch lives.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The 1st book was ok, but after that I felt like it was the same thing over and over again, not into the whole submissive thing
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft pocket edition This app like most others needs to update and have the appropriate  version. And it needs to have a relationship with the developers and crew for special editions on kindle.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I just discovered this show a few months ago - even thought it's been on several years now.  It's a great story line, full of fun and danger.  If you like a good &#34;cop&#34; show this works; if you like a good &#34;romance&#34; in the making show, this works as well!  Love the interaction between Becket and Castle.  Enjoy it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This temple run allows you to do so much more. It lets you choose to pick &quot;save me&quot; or just quit. It has had a few glitches on me before. Like sometimes it will return to the home screen when I pick &quot;save me&quot; , but other than that it is a great game. If you enjoyed the first one you are going to love this one.
B000FKO5WE|5.0|Muy Buen Producto. Llego a mi Domicilio en tiempo y Forma. Lo recomiendo a todos los amantes de la buena música

B002BWP49C|5.0|I wanted all 4 of the Twilight movies and at a good price. Amazon filled the bill, product was exactly as advertised, love it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is absolutely mystifying. From it's beautiful grafics to its awsome replayability this game is the STUFF. You have to buy it while its free.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I wanted all 4 of the Twilight movies and at a good price. Amazon filled the bill, product was exactly as advertised, love it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive game and even better because it doesn't cost a penny I think it's worth a download if you need a time filler
B001NLKT60|5.0|TGWPWF has the defining great characters and great story. The story brings out new information about Lisbeth's past that drive the next two stories. Slow but enjoyable reading. The Millennium discussions get a bit tedious but that's the only negative thing that can be said. Its a shame there won't be more coming.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great .easy to understand .no complaints about this app .I like all of the parts of this app :)
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game SUCKS it does not let me turn ever not on my kindle fire or on my ipad 4 don't even bother wasting your time
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really love this game you never know what is around the corner. You find passages to collect coins. I would give it 4 stars out of 5
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Loved Rio!  Fast paced, and totally adorable.  A great game for girls and boys alike! The you can overboard is a must see!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Brilliant once again. I really enjoy this series. Time for the next book! I  would recommend this book for the world.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing amazing amazing. I could barely put it down. I haven't seen the movie so I had no comparison. It was better than I thought it'd be.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really useful app,helpful to see how much battery left and where you use most power nice to keep track of what you spend most time doing also!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|such a great show! cant wait for the rest of the season to start. good quality . . . .
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I admit I am a techno geek who loves space and technology. What a fun book! Congrats on keeping the technology straight (I think) and holding my interest completely! I loved the writing style! Simple but fun! Although the language was a bit much at times, it did to get not get in my way. Looking forward to his next effort!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything about this show is excellent, from great acting, casting, costumes, settings, and historical references.  The Brits know their history.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A must read.  This opens up a whole new realm of understanding about what happens when we leave the &#34;physical world&#34;.  Dr. Alexander has a fascinating story to tell.
0553378384|2.0|Way off what it is advertised to be. Didn't contain any pertinent information about astrology and signs. Jan is good author book is a waste of money
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a thoroughly engaging and entertaining story about life changes, attitudes toward new and unknown experiences, and never giving up on life. Great movie!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Kids love trains, cute movie, we watch it almost every day during the Christmas season and some all year round. Great for all ages Even my 2 year old loves this movie
B000VDDWDS|5.0|This is an excellent adventure movie with great action and drama, overall an excellent quality Blu-ray product. Russell Crowe is excellent, as always.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game but after a while it gets kind of boring but over all gr8 I have no truble loading it and the graphics are amazing!!!
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I listened to some of the samples and wasn't too impressed, but I took a shot and bought Gossamer anyway.  It is amazing.  Every song is emotionally powerful and catchy.  Some people try to compare this album to Passion Pit's older albums but no comparison is needed.  Although framed with slightly \\"busier\\" music, Angelakos's voice perfectly conveys the energy of the lyrics and music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome fun app! love to play when I'm bored! haha I love horses so this is definitely the perfect app for me!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a awesome game cause it changes themes but it always stops to catch up with its self.<br /><br />The other bad thing is everything is so expensive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the new updates make the game better! More interesting. Play the game cause it is awesome. Like better than anything.
B00821OUT6|5.0|I rarely watch tv anymore but this is a great series! Season 2 is strong as well! The acting and the story are both impressive.
B009YQJ322|5.0|It arrived in great time. The order went well, I liked it, eight more words. This product is a good movie.
B0098460O4|5.0|Surprising great music. Better than Boccelli for same songs.<br />Both sing very nice together...<br />Saw on England's TV Talent Program.<br />Most music sung in Italian
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I cried when I read this book.  I sympathized the poor's life became hard to live for money and was pursued anyone who is crediter, because I also poor. But I decided to live like Jean Valjean rather than a schemer and also want to resemble Father's life could give anything what is important to me. This is the book call me what I have to do for being a human, and why I have to live Jean's life for satisfaction my life.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I only heard about this book when the movie came out and since it exploded so abruptly onto the book scene, I borrowed it from a friend to read.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was just--okay. I didn't really see what the fuss was about. While certainly better than some garbage on the market (Twilight) and an interesting premise--I found it lacking in real characterization.<br /><br />Katniss is mostly just okay. I have only read the first book--and I heard that she wimps out in the last two--which is disappointing, if that's true. She is fairly realistic about her chances. Sometimes her 'hostile' attitudes seem extremely forced--like the Author was extremely emphatic on creating an anti-Bella. But she's also fairly tough and self-reliant, which I really liked in a female lead.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can smell a love triangle from a mile away so I just tried to ignore Gale and Peeta's sissy attitudes when it comes to whether or not Katniss 'meant' any of the act that she and Peeta were putting on during the games. Like, really you two? That's what you're worried about? Life or death situation, you morons. There are more important things out there.<br /><br />The Games themselves--I thought the brutality was undercut by the Peeta/Katniss act going on. Basically everyone except Districts 11 and 12 are portrayed are barbarous bloody-thirsty animals. But Katniss mourns and adorns Rue with flowers, but leaves Foxface (who never did anything to anyone, except be really smart and avoid everything). The love story, to me, was kind of unnecessary--but I guess this is marketed to young teens.<br /><br />I was also thinking the entire time--about why on earth the districts allow this to go on. I have heard that this is addressed in the other two books--but just in the first one, it seems so weird that the adults don't rise up to protect their children like they should be.<br /><br />One thing I did REALLY love---was the contrast set up between the Capital and the outer districts. That was cool. I liked that a lot.<br /><br />Of course, there is also the inevitable Battle Royale comparison--a Japanese novel with a similar story--though much more thought out and I would say, more brutal. Also a good deal more characterization--so that you actually give a crap or are interested in some of the characters.<br /><br />I shouldn't sound so sour--I did like the book. I thought it was an interesting quick read. Took me just a couple hours to get through it--I just recently saw the movie so I'm thinking about reading the last two, which might change my mind. So its okay, definitely worth a look if you've never read Battle Royale. But it has kind of the \\"Author's First Published Book\\" tang to it. The writing is kind of shaky, a little clumsy, characterizations are sometimes inconsistent but maybe those improve through the books? I hope so, cause its an interesting premise.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Fantastic.Love this series. Reminds me of Dawn of the Dead only as an anime version and this was worth getting.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This was a great guide for the first time Kindle writer.  The step by step instructions were very clear.  Would have been 5 stars had it  not focused entirely on Microsoft Word.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show Nashville, and I am not a contemporary country fan.  Prefer the older stuff.  But the show is great, and I really like some of the songs.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|AS ALWAYS TOM CLANCY CAME UP WITH ANOTHER WINNER<br />A MUST READ FOR ALL TOM CLANCY FANS<br />IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT HOW SAFE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS REALY ARE
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I think I liked this book better because Lena was in it less.  So far she's yucky- lots of power but still weak & \\"woe is me\\".<br /><br />I like the other characters including Ethan when the writers make him smart- the slow Ethan is almost as bad as Lena.<br /><br />I find it really irritating when we have to wander around with the main characters forever and then other characters pop in- what's the point of the wandering other than drawing out the story in order to sell more books.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the type of stories I like have gotten away with this- so it's really unlikely to change.  Bummer cuz most would be better with about half as many books.
0740748475|5.0|My husband is a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan and he loved that I bought this for him for Christmas.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a good game. its pretty realistic I guess. I like that you get to compete and stuff. you also get to buy more than one horse .
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|An intriguing movie about what we begin to find out when we investigate a life.  Life flows a lot more smoothly for those of us who can get on someone's psychological turf.  This movie provides a good example of the value of knowing one's family, its characters and especially its flawed characters.  Investigating our fellow humankind is one of the best jobs to hold on planet earth.  It is good to see Daniel Craig in other than a James Bond role.  The role of a &#34;cloak and dagger&#34; operative or writer involves patience, deductive reasoning, some imagination, the ability to connect the dots.  One does not have to be an &#34;international man of action&#34; such as Commander Bond to be able to have a fairly active impact upon our society.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This was bought as a gift...great value for the price. Was exactly what the person wanted - would recommend to anyone!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I down loaded this game because it was free but now I play it more than any one that I have. Great way to pass some time. I recommend it highly.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This was bought as a gift...great value for the price. Was exactly what the person wanted - would recommend to anyone!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Lovely story, wonderful characters. I found this by accident and was pleasantly surprised. Very like a well-known Jane Austen novel, but a refreshing version nonetheless. Good characters, good screen adaptation, good acting. I did not like the adaptations of Elizabeth Gaskell's other novels as much.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I choose this Ultimate Hits because it's a great value and I truly miss Garth!!!<br />Its has all his wonderful hits....all on three discs...for a great price!!
1926778537|5.0|If you're a fan of Video Game/Comic Book Art or of Joe Mad then you'll want this book for your collection! Simply amazing work!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|With just a few more details this would have been a great story. While all of us would have a different ending, a few more insights to why this ending might have motivated me to give it a score of five.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Big Firefly fan. I bought the series too. Watch them back to back and this is the final touch. I love this show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is cool you can build anything that you imagine .You also can play multiplayer with your friends you can make a animal farm or kill mobs do what every thing you want so I would buy minecraft pocket edition even though it cost money I would buy it.
B000UX6THK|1.0|Always wanted to see this series but the last two discs were damaged and parts crucial to the story-line were un-viewable. Very disappointing! Hoping the seller will contact me with a fix so I can change my review.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Love the stars, the music, and the plot while a bit standard, was so enjoyable!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I find this to be a very enjoyable game and good successor to the original, and would most certainly recommend it to someone who enjoys casual reflex-based games. My only gripe is that it periodically crashes on my first-gen Kindle Fire in a most frustrating manner, usually right after I die but before I can ressurrect or return to menu and receive the rewards I'be collected in that run.
1907590099|5.0|I had not read this book before and was amazed at the depth and clarity of Huxley's insights. His description of the brain as a reducing valve that compresses our perceptual field down to the cartoon needed for survival influenced all the psychedelic writers after him, from Leary to Pichbeck. Huxley is cool, factual and humble. His comments about art on psychedelics are truly spiritual, his perception of the unconditioned in draperies and landscapes is a wonderful illumination that changes my perception of art. Heaven and Hell is a very different essay than Doors of Perception, but equally original and enlightening. Having read most of The Perennial Philosophy, I was aware of Huxley's encyclopedic knowledge of mysticism and his deep spiritual insight, but The Doors of Perception is almost better than TPP as a spiritual handbook, partly because it is so much less ambitious. Huxley is a genuinely brilliant person, the fine-grain of his vision makes this a book to read and re-read over a lifetime.
0307474259|5.0|Over the past year I've experimented with eating a reduced carb diet and increasing my protein.  Before I was mostly a vegetarian and ate little fat.  You might say I was fat-phobic.<br /><br />My weight did not change with reducing carbs--it stays stable through portion control and regular exercise. My goal was not weight reduction but improved health.<br /><br />And better health is what I got from reducing my carb intake. My latest lipid profile (from last year's to this) saw my HDL rise from 42 to 70 and my triglycerides fall from 98 to 72. Truth told, my LDL went up a bit, but the ratio of total cholesterol to triglycerides and to HDL is excellent.<br /><br />After reading too many books about the correct way to eat, I've proven, to my satisfaction--and my doctor's--that Taube's advice is valid and true.<br /><br />I didn't use the book to give myself permission to eat triple cheese burgers and  large orders of fries (didn't want them any how)...no, I mostly used legumes, turkey, and fish as my protein sources and ate more nuts. A bit more cheese, but not too much. Made an effort to eat more salads, more vegetables such as broccoli.<br /><br />Pasta on occasion (whole wheat) and low-carb wraps are still in my life a bit, but the refined white flour and starchy carbs are gone.<br /><br />Try it!  You'll like it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Watch the movie that night it arrived with my projector the picture quality is perfect, audio is 4 out of 5 rating still very nice, I love the part when the elder nun sang &#34; Climb every M
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|First off I love Helloween and I always have ever since I bought Walls Of Jericho.  My favorite meterial was their early work with Kiske/Hanson but I also very much enjoy the Deris era for the most part, their latest prior to Straight Out Of Hell 7 Sinners was excellent.  I found this album to have similar points of greatness as previous releases but got to poppy in some areas for my liking, espessially the chorus parts which get tired as they seem to keep reusing them on  their filler songs, the same break in the songs with the soft poppy vocal (example: \\"Far Beyond The Stars\\")  The guitar work is awesome just stay heavy.  My thoughts on this new album are as follows:<br /><br />1. \\"Nabataea\\" 10/10 decent<br />2. \\"World of War\\" 8/10<br />3. \\"Live Now!\\" 6/10<br />4. \\"Far From the Stars 1/10<br />5. \\"Burning Sun\\" 9/10<br />6. \\"Waiting for the Thunder\\" 7/10<br />7. \\"Hold Me in Your Arms\\" 1/10<br />8. \\"Wanna Be God\\" 8/10<br />9. \\"Straight Out of Hell\\" 10/10<br />10. \\"A hole\\" 10/10 (Best song on the album)<br />11. \\"Years\\" 7/10<br />12. \\"Make Fire Catch the Fly\\" 7/10<br />13. \\"Church Breaks Down\\" 8/10<br />14. Another Shot of life 7/10
B005K17RU0|1.0|This format is not one that I'm used to..I would much prefer an hourly weather report .  I'm now, once again, checking weather on my PC.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game. Great twist to temple run. Cool how they do the world tour thing ive only been around for new york and Rio but liking it so far.
B005LAII12|3.0|When I laugh hard I tend to snort, as well.<br /><br />Ted provided a few such moments.  Otherwise it was a clever and well executed project that could have been much better.  It's edginess and technical virtuosity took the film halfway, but thereafter it was more Friends than Louie CK.  That disappointed me.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|Great used value. I found it for $9.99, not bad for blu-ray. I would recommend it. It's lot's of fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the kids and I are addicted. pretty fun game. we come back to it day after day. it's fun to see who can beat who's score
B009UX2YAC|4.0|May seem relatively simple, jump or run around collecting stars. If this were the case, I would become quickly bored. There are mini-challenges that can be bought, so you are not stuck continually trying to complete the same one over and over.The problem with the game is it is lacking in directions when it cones to completing the missions. For example,what are power ups? Are they the items collected along the way or the stars (multiplier).<br />A HUGE plus is no friends are needed to play.
B000059ZLH|5.0|The most masterful album written by DT, and only the second part of an 80 minute long song comes to life on a great dvd that should be purchased along with the album [[ASIN:B00005QJDG Live Scenes From New York]]. The video of Kent Broadhurst speaking as the hypnotherapist over LaBrie is chilling and Theresa Thomason's solo spot with Petrucci is amazing as well. A must have for Dream Theater fans, and even if you aren't into the band, if you like progressive rock you should know that [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]] was rated by Rolling Stone as the NUMBER ONE PROGRESSIVE ALBUM OF ALL TIME over [[ASIN:B000001ESF 2112]] and [[ASIN:B00007LTI9 Close to the Edge]].
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Yep like everyone else I found this an absorbing read. Great original characters. Every bit as good as the other two books in the series.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I'm not an iPod person, so I was so glad to find this single was available especially since I can't get enough of this song.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Here's a no nonsense app one can download and use... My first from Amazon appstore... Simply does what it says it does.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun mostly for horse lovers. I say that you should play this game. Did you know you do everything that you do in real life but it is a great game.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I am a lover of Middle Earth and I really like the music of Howard Shore in this recording. I also the music he wrote for Lord of the Rings&#34; movies.  The music really &#34;fits&#34; the action and I enjoy Shore's use of lietmotivs, sort of the way Wagner used them in his operas.  I'm glad Mr. shore used them in both films.  Only one thing -  I wish there were more of the songs of the dwarves.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site hes something for everyone.  I would highly recommend it for seeking inspiration for any project or renovation. Fun to see what's out there.
B004LWZW8S|4.0|I love the movie, even though it could have been better, one thing i found amazing was that this movie had 2 Alternate endings and none of them were even remotely good lol, but in any case you will love watching most of it.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Being a cat lover, I loved this movie and feel the animation was terrific.  My grandkids love to watch it with me.
0553801473|2.0|So bad and convoluted that I can't even remember the real plot.  You blow George but I'm sure I'll read the next one.  Jerk.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of those programs that causes you to change your life's schedule to ensure you see the latest episode!!  Great scenery, actors, and plots.  Easy to get addicted!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Installed it twice and still will not work.  When clicked on, it just stalls, makes the phone vibrate a bit, then goes back to home screen on phone.  Disappointing because we play it on the kindle and it works fine.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|if you liked cut the rope but enjoy more leisurely paced games this is perfect for you. its a game you can take your time and think about how to beat the puzzle.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I thought this was a great twist to a classic. I really don't understand why everyone is so hard on Kristen Stewart, I thought she did rather well.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|It a good movie I love the comic book so when I heard a part 2 I was like &#34; sweet Apple pie I'm gating it&#34; so I did
1439196834|5.0|It's a great gift for a How I Met Your Mother fan, and a funny conversation-starter or coffee table book!
030758836X|5.0|Excellent book, fast read, gets your interest right from the start.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book to all readers out there
143911000X|5.0|It's a great gift for a How I Met Your Mother fan, and a funny conversation-starter or coffee table book!  It has a lot of the bro code rules from the end of episodes and some other funny ones!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my alltime favorite writers. The amount of research that goes into his stories is intense.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It was great, as I've. come to expect from G5! Loved the mini game option when I got stuck in searches.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|If only more Americans knew about these camps inside N. Korea!  Now they can know.<br />This book reads swiftly and is hard to put down.  I was horrified to read about the network of camps inside N. Korea and how they punish people and even children for the offenses of relatives they never even knew.  It is unimaginable.  It sounds like hell on earth.<br />Would that the Western world would wake up and do something about this!  Maybe if we're lucky North Korea will implode sooner rather than later.  A system like that cannot go on forever.<br />I wring my hands over this and wish that our government or the U.N. would make it our business to investigate these camps and do something about them and the unfortunate people who are locked in them.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Wow this book is great I can't wait till the next book.  If you like adventure this is a great book.
B002BWP49C|5.0|A great gift to give someone really into the Twilight saga. My daughter just loved the fact that I bought this for her!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is what love is, willing to drop your self wants for another. I was so captivated I actually thougth I was apart of the storyline!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great book quick read it was very precise in details and had a very good plot, it was funny also
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I got over the shock of things I had no idea existed, I loved it. The drama, the intimacy was on the edge of your seat.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Ok, it was fine. Great ending and  interested in seeing the movie when it comes out later this month hdh
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've never had a book to captivate me as this has. Get past the sexual events and look at what two people can do because of the love they have for one another. Most heart touching book I've ever read!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is an amazing writer and an amazing person. I can't put the book down. Her amazing fortitude is a goal most of us can only imagine. I look forward to many more inspirational books from this fantastic human being.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love it and I can't wait for the whole series of Season 3! It is wonderful to be able to watch when I want.
B000I9VZJ8|4.0|I ordered it for a friend and we enjoyed it. Not side splitting funny, but funny nonetheless.. I also enjoyed the quality
B001NLKXK2|3.0|Interesting to read about imagined progress of this disease.  I think I would rather read a clinical explanation.  Easy reading.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|and I just love this movie. I kinda get bored when they have that 20 minutes of seriousness (like all of his movies) but it goes back to being funny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I looove this game!!! This is absolutely a must to download. I was shocked at how great the graphics are. And they are always adding new items and keeping u interested!! Go get it now!!!!
B0067AC5KA|4.0|These are great books. I had a little trouble staying with the first book (in the beginning), because there is a lot of information and character building, but hang in there and it is definitely worth it.  If you enjoy mystery, intrigue and a little history, you will love them (all 3 books).  Once I got into the first one, I was hooked, couldn't wait for the next 2 and felt like I knew these characters by the end.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|&#34;The Racketeer&#34;:<br />John Grisham continues to be one of the great story tellers. This story keeps you turning the pages
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great trilogy! A glimpse of a possible future. I so could imagine this being a reality.  It takes human nature, parts of history and the threat of a potential future and weaves it all together.  Only we can make a difference.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its kinda like temple run. It never ends. I luv it. You should get it and kids out there i say hi. Kids will like it most btw. So kids get this. For a fellow kid. It is free so thats a plus. My only complaint they change a character like every two weeks or so. But i luv it so please get it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Three dvd's for the first season.  One of the best shows on TV.  The dvd's are in perfect condition. Would recommend to everyone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The charger and cable work well to charge the kindle fire in 4 hours rather than the 14 using the usb/cable charge.  However, the charged kindle only last about 1 - 2 hours running.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great! Can't stop playing<br /><br />I have always had this game it is awesome. Right now is the tour where there is a new map each day. A must get game
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. It is kind of like WoW but a lot less detail and options, but it is free to play once you buy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome i play it more than the pc version. If you know how to please tell me. Thanks
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Easy to use and gets you tons of music that you might not have otherwise heard. Also great for finding new music and artists that you have not heard before.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Cool, it's brilliant, buy it! I like the levels they're interesting!pudding monsters is good. I've been playing it all the time. Its worth it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Temple Run 2 has a lot of things going for it: it's visually stimulating, addictive, and features a plethora of boosts and power ups. You have a greater control of how you prepare, and you can respawn from those pesky &quot;but I jumped!&quot; moments. Unfortunately, the game suffers greatly in one category: it simply is not challenging. The draw of the original game was its addictive, albeit frustrating, difficulty. I simply don't feel it in this game. At first, I thought I had just improved, but when I closed the app an  opened the original version, I found it just as straining as ever. Ultimately, not bad, but not the same.
B0086700CM|4.0|Grandchildren love playing this game.  They are young and it is easy for them to learn and fun for them.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Rough start, but what once the excellent plot got going the book was hard to put down., can't wait for book 2<br />Wondering what is going to happen next
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app the horses look great and move realistically the games are fun and not too hard to play
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run two is so much fun.  it is just so cool and great.  at the end of the game there is a cart ride that is so cool.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I have the full version, and its FUN!!! it may not be that good in the tutorial, but the full version is alright. its still in its developmental stage.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The main characters were Greg Heffley, Rodrick, Mrs.Heffley, Mr.Heffley, and Manny. The book was a good book. I love Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Absolutely love this book! Simple yet so impacting. Wish I had read this book sooner, the idea that we all have \\"love tanks\\" and how simple it is to physically and emotionally fulfill our spouses desires and vice versa, to create a successful marriage, by applying our spouses love language daily will change and save marriages everywhere!
B00A757EFW|2.0|the goal is a tease so you would buy the real one. not so great. it stops in the middle to ask you to buy the higher version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game that I played in the world really because can use skateboards and earn coins to unlock people and new skateboarders
030758836X|1.0|This horrid story can only be written by a clinical psychopath. She knows little about the damage people like Amy do to their children.alot of hype,but a waste of time. What troubles me more than the story is the author's<br />sickness in writing this.
0345528581|5.0|I've always exercised, but somehow I'm not in such great shape. I've read, and used, a lot of workout books in my time. Most turn out to not be worth the paper they're printed on. I've even read a few books on programs like Navy Seal training, combat conditioning, stuff like that - most assume that the reader is in pretty fearsome shape to begin with. There's not a lot out there, at least, there's not a lot with any value, for someone who's not in great shape.<br /><br />This is different. Lots different.<br /><br />Mr. Lauren gets it - we're not all starting from perfect, fit bodies. There are four programs - I don't remember exactly what their names are, but there's a basic for beginners, 1st class for intermediates, master for advanced, and an elite class for those who are beyond the first three classes. He suggests where to start - if you can do these five or so things, start with this class.<br /><br />I'm starting with the basic class, and I like it. It's work, but it's not sooo hard that I don't see the point. The exercises are pretty doable, and where they're not, there are suggestions for making them a bit easier. If they're too easy, there are plenty of suggestions for making things harder. The bottom line is, 30 minutes, every other day. (I'm using another cardio program and another nutrition program, so I can't say how good the programs in this book are.) Even with my bad knees and other orthopedic difficulties, I can do these without too much modification.<br /><br />If you can only choose one exercise book, get this one. I'll update when I've been at this a while longer.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Whenever Andrea Bocelli and David Foster get together to produce an album it's going to be special.  One need not understand Italian or French or any of the other four languages he sings in, only the language of romantic love.  Bocelli, as always delivers the proper mood.  One gets a lot of bang for their buck with this 18 song album; not to mention three duets with Jennifer &#34;J-Lo&#34; Lopez, Nelly Furtado and the late Edith Piaf.  This is a great album for Valentine's Day, as a gift or a mood setter.
B005FISC52|5.0|I ordered this for my grandaughter's christmas present<br />see loves the series and is very sad that this is the<br />last season
B0063IH60K|1.0|I know this was a free game, but when the ads started popping up, I felt that was a distraction. Already get enough ads on my Kindle Fire HD anyway. Didn't even finish one game and deleted it from my device.

B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was really funny'...lol<br />I half to put 21 words so.... g g b b v b hghhvhghvv bvgsmer v<br />(My 9 year old son submitted the above review for this book, if he thought enough about the book to make a review, then it must be good. He has a great sense of humor, so for him to think it was funny... it must be!)
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Goodkind continued his Sword of Truth series and the book is good.  Be aware that the Kindle version of this book has a flaw - does not display in the color mode white letters-on black background.  For some reason - it works correctly on the Kindle applications on the computer, iPad, or iPhone - but not on the Kindle Fire.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My husband and I took our kids to see this movie in the theater and we all loved it! Highly reccommend.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|these guys really get what makes for a great tablet game, simple mechanis, bright colors, slick controls, and just enough to keep you scratching your head w out throwing your device against the wall. bravo, lightning does strike twice.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have always loved the game so finding it was a great treat. For anyone who likes solitaire, this game with a twist will definitely be a hit with you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It helps you learn how to take care of animals. I absolutely recommend it and think it is fun and educational
1452105111|5.0|excellent quality. nice thick cardstock-like  circles, beautiful colors! easy to thread letters and pictures. i used them for my twins' first birthday and we will use them for many occasions to come!
1400049628|5.0|I love any books about zombies, so this was a no brainer. I enjoyed it very much and you will as well. Good for ages 13 and up I'd say. If you are looking for another great zombie book, grab a copy of \\"[]\\" for your collection.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I LOVED this series, my husband and I would wait all week for this show, speculating all week what was to come.Brian Cranston at his finest.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so editing I cant stop it is.very fun I lllllllllooooooooovvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeee it so much omg it is cool how it chafes towns I give it a4.have a nice day Alyssa
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I knew when I downloaded this app for my daughter it was a money scam. I locked the in app shopping before hand. So that isn't an issue for me. My problem is the bugs and the glitches it is a nightmare adding friends visiting them to receive the hearts and more often than not the connection fails. When you can visit for the daily rounds the objects you tap are not there. Also removing friends who are not active is annoying. If gameloft can get their acts together and fix the bugs this game would be alright.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg guys you got try get this game it is so cool every body should have it<br />I just love it and I know you would to so go and get this game now!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I know other reviewers complained about the original music not being included in the series, but I honestly didn't notice nor did I remember what the original music was anyway. Great price for an entire series and 2 movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|\\"Subway Surfers\\" is a game that is interesting fun and addictive I got this game on my kindle fire not even a week ago and haven't stoped since. Its so fun! I loved how it had so many characters and upgrades!!! If you are reading this comment and have not purchased \\"Subway Surfers\\" get it now!!!!  :-* :-1 :-o
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I have used couple of other cases, which just looks pretty but not worth for a rough usage like me.<br />This one stays in tact, fits perfectly and worth.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game ever great for horse lovers!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! great cause its free that is a big awesome
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought Gone Girl was very well written. I was captivated by the story and it kept me going as the characters changed.  Loved it.  Would highly reccommend this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Couldn't wait to watch the last 3 episodes in regular broadcast, so I bought the season on amazon prime. Thoroughly enjoyed the show/plot line, but picture quality was frequently bad and at times stalls while the audio continues so that then there's a rapid catch up of the video.
B0070066DI|3.0|Running in either PWM or Auto or any other modes on a Gigabyte Mobo, the fan's duty cycle is annoying.  At full blast it's as loud as a regular heatsink/fan combo. Sounds like a refrigerator compressor cycling which is annoying.  Have already taken the fan off, cleaned the blades and tried compressed air.  i5 chip,  stays cool no matter the load or fan speed, I bought this for low sound specifically.  Installation was easy. but the fan is annoying.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I like this movie because it kept you interested the hole time.  I would recommend everyone to watch this movie because it was directed very well and the actors were terrific.
B000KFB4PK|1.0|I was so disappointed with this product.  I bought it for my 10 year old who is a lego enthusiast and needed a watch.  The band kept falling apart and falling off his wrist at random times during the day.  It was especially disappointing since lego products are usually so good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great .. totally realistic .. absolutely love it!!! just would love to get coins and gems faster.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had no ideas the trilogy would be so depressing.  I didn't see the movie because I wanted to read the trilogy and now that I have I can say that I didn't expect it to be so psychologically depressing with all of the rebellion, killing, suppression, etc.  It's generally not my type of reading but since I had started the first book I wanted to know what the ending was all about.  The movie didn't even come close to the deepth-ness of the book(s).
B0017HEYEI|1.0|Packaging and product are nice, except for the fact that there is no warning that the title is in Korean and not english.  Supposedly, there's a menu offering the english language version of the film,  except the menu is also in Korean.  This purchase is being returned to Amazon.
0345357116|5.0|Small book, definitely a copy that was cheaply made.  It will certainly suffice however, and should last provided you don't beat up the book.
B00003CXMG|5.0|1.  Superbad<br />2.  America Pie<br />3.  Almost Famous<br />4.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High<br />5.  The Sure Thing<br />6.  Weird Science<br />7.  Sixteen Candles<br />8.  Breakfast Club<br />9.  The Squid & the Whale<br />10.  Rodger Dodger<br /><br />Ah, 1985...it was a glorious time.  Reaganomics, go go 80s, Yuppies, et al.  I miss those days.  Times change, but people remain the same.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I loved this movie - It reminded me of the Batman Comics (or maybe it was Batman in Detective comics) that I read in the 50s or early 60s.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A professional and useful app. Artfully designed and helpful from the first moment I downloaded it. I recommend this download for all Kindle users.Go Lakers.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Now when I write tales of my epic conquests I have a vessel with which to carry them about between mine different devices. Huzzah! Ill have another!
034580404X|1.0|ufta! I think a 1st grader could write better than this author... the story is rather gross... not worth your time if you are looking for clever and grammatically more challenging material
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|When this app comes up on a Kindle it is a monster!  It takes up the whole screen.  Easy to read and use.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Pudding Monsters is very akin to Cut the Rope or Angry Birds. Honestly, ZeptoLabs has some really consistent quality in games.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am in LOVE with the Angry Birds empire!  It is only fitting that they would venture out to the most famous Empire ever!  The sounds, the graphics, the way they integrated all the birds into the characters of Star Wars is GREAT!  I love it.  I play this game to have fun, but it is challenging too.  It is also interesting to look at and is hilarious sometimes.  Stacking the pigs on top of each other to make them tall enough to be Vader is so funny to me.  I truly enjoy this game and I am so glad they keep coming!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|get this game. best game ever u will love it and best of all its free who ever thought they would make a second temple run
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is so horrible it is fantastic!!  I love every minute of it.  The language and the situations are raunchy and crass, but the writing and the actors do such a great job that it doesn't come off that way.  It comes off funny and well-done.  Loved it at the theater and really enjoy having a copy of my own.
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|A wonderful travel book, only slightly out of date, by an author with a very caustic sense of humor (which I loved).
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|One of my favorite shows. Reminds me of when I lived in the U.K. and would watch shows like this on Sunday evenings
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Need less to say, this movie was a tear jerk-er for me. I am 28 and it was still a great movie to watch with my mother.
B007SUW24W|3.0|Wasn't really what I anticipated music wise.  I only liked one or two of the songs on this album of his.
B00340I4KG|5.0|One of the best movie of all time I can't get enough of this movie a Travolta and cage  none stop action coolest movie wish they made a part two
B004GYY714|5.0|Tunein Radio is a lifesaver.  Love having the choice of music at my fingertips.  I really enjoy this app on my kindle fire.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Walt continues to turn into someone unrecognisable to himself and Jesse continues to emote soulfully; what's not to like (oh yeah; Gus).? Saul continues to steal the show.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|This has been the best addition to my online world.  Can't believe how much easier this has made my life.
B000FCKBCU|3.0|My sister recommended this. It was kind of cute. Watching the type AAA lawyer get booted and end up in the back-of-beyond was the highlight of the story for me. Speaking as a professional caterer, just a little too much suspension of disbelief was required to manage to turn someone who has never boiled water into an honest-to-goodness chef in three months. Characters are not terribly well-developed but then they can't be; it just wouldn't work in this kind of story.  Great beach read, for those so inclined.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|This story wasn't that exciting.  I think the author had a good idea but just couldn't deliver.  I needed more depth of feeling.  Just felt like something was missing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I seriously couldn't put this book down for the two days it took to read it. I recommend this book to anyone who is a romantic that enjoys a thrilling twist too.<br /><br />Desperately waiting for Entwined with you!!!!!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Great calculator.  Works well and is very easy to understand.  Functions just as you would expect a calculator to function.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game...and i don't mind my kids playing this...I have to pay every morning before leaving and every night before going to bed. The only thing is every now and then the game skips, freezes, and jumps...but love it none the same...
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My kids and I love this game.  Some of the levels are a bit challenging, but that is what keeps it interesting.  Cool how you get to draw your own characters.
B000FBFMIO|4.0|Time to go to the next book in the series.<br />Just like remembered from the first time I read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun. The only sad thing is you only have almost 30 days to buy some of the characters( changes places almost every 30 days ). If you have no internet it loads slower. Besides what that there is no problems. I highly recommended this game, every time me and my friends play it, it gets so addicting.
B000002QWD|5.0|I don't like this system of having to write at least 16 words.  THis is the last review I give until you fix it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The problem I had with the app is that when I click on someone's attachment or shared document that is on a webpage, it doesn't allow me to go back to Facebook. I fight with it every time. When I go back to the fb app, it sends me directly to the webpage. I hit the back button, it does it again. I struggle with it for 2mns and finally. Also, sometimes I select one thing and another pops up, ei I hit the news feed button and it sends me to my page. I pull fb app up and it doesn't show the notifications even though I know they exist due to email notifications.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|While the story started out slow for me once I got to know Charlie I really started to like him and care about him. He was compassionate and insightful perhaps to a fault, but that's who he was and he learned that was the most important thing. I highlighted quite a few lines because I found them meaningful and true. I also feel compelled to read all of Charlie's favorite books now.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Excellent novel, will keep you wanting to read more.  I had a hard time putting it down.  The characters all most come to life in your mind.  Well worth your time.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I appreciate that Mr. Hitchens took an almost voyeuristic look at his struggle with cancer. He often speaks about what he's feeling like a reporter in a battlefield and other times the writing is filled with emotion and prose. This was the first thing I read by him (after hearing so many positive things about his writings) and I am encouraged to read more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should getthis app because its fun it lets you make what ever you want and ITS AWSOM!!!!!!!!! but I wish it would update faster I cant play with my friend because they all have 0.6.0 and I have 0.5.0
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downlaoded for the kids I think I play it more its lots of fun and easy to play for youngsters.
B00AYL7OAY|4.0|This one is chill. Expect the same grooves we've all come to know. Relax and enjoy, you won't be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a book I couldn't put down. I am going for the second, hope it is as good as this one!
B0064W65SO|5.0|This is a great read and digital addition to any Batman comic book fan. I highly recommend. I had no problem reading it on my Kindle HD 8.9.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|After looking at some of the reviews for this, I was a little concerned but it didn't stop me from renting it. I have wanted to see this since I first heard about it, and got tired of waiting for it to be available at a redbox when I happened to be at one. I have to admit I'm already a sucker for anything with animals, and love animated, CGI, ect 'children's' movies, especially funny ones, but I loved this movie. Those who say it had no story to it are probably the reason we get such big budget movies that are all repeats of each other anymore these days. Yes, it's in black and white. Yes, it's not some masterful tale that you can't sort of see where it is going to go once you're a little into it, but I think that it was a nice play on the typical Frankenstein story. It made me laugh, tear up, and smile - and I'm a 23 year old woman. It also had that Tim Burtonesque feel to it to boot. So if you don't tend to like kiddie movies, or it need to be a nonstop action, hands at the edge of your seat type movie to keep your attention, then take a cue. If you like a little sweet, a little funny, a little childish, mixed with a little dark, give it a try.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|Initially, I had hardly any issues with this app. Now, all it does is crash. I'm not able to view any streams regardless of the resolution. Aside from that, the ability to participate in the chat would also be helpful.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|and loved the movie. It was sort of like a consolation prize to not getting to see any further into what the series could have been. I don't want to ruin anything, but I have to say that I was worried that it would make me mad, and it didn't.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I have had the same computer with the AMD X2 4--- since 2007 and figured it was time for a upgrade. I'm an AMD Fanboy so I decided to go with this processor. I chose a gigabyte motherboard and 8 GB of DDR3 Ram. This computer screams!
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is okay and I would reccomend to others. I haven't used it much yet. I like the choices.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is a very good movie. I already saw it but I wanted to own the set. The one's I bought here are just right.
0061854549|5.0|One of the best books i have read so for. Like the adage goes, common sense is not common.<br />This book highlights our behaviours under various circumstances and tells us that even the highgly rational<br />people will not be making the rational judgements and what's reason behind it , sceientfically through experiments. Among other things It also, helped me understand why in any society we need moral boundaries for our actions and a need for a relegion/god/belief. Like for example, why people tend be more honest after they are remainded of Ten commandments.<br />Why people think materiasticly after just mentioning of unrelated monitory fact. Why some people indulge in reckless sexual behaviour.<br /><br />A real eye opener and kudos to our wisdom of forefathers.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|So much fun and super addictive. A great sequel. 4 Stars because Game freezes and crashes after a while (I have a Razr Maxx). Usually when I hit the 'Save Me' button. One crash wiped all my game info. :( I was at level 7. Time to start again.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Laugh out loud funny.  My husband and I love it, my seven year old loves it. Silly funny Christmas classic.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|We love the American Pie series.  The unrated reunion version is one of the better sequel movies made so far.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it!<br /><br />I recommend it for everyone young and old. Its a really funny and sad read, great story line.
B000031WD8|5.0|We love the American Pie series.  This one makes it nice to watch on a big screen without losing any of the picture.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|I don't expect Jane Austen movie adaptations to remain completely faithful to the books - that would make for long and boring movies.  However, i do expect important, key parts to not be overlooked or completely messed up, so to speak.<br /><br />So, this version?  The camera-man can't hold a camera still; the acting is so-so but characters are mis-cast and hard to believe; the script, well, wish they would have stuck more to the book...  Skip this one and check out the one with Amanda Root & Ciarán Hinds if you want a nice adaptation.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|What can I say?  I love anything that Rod Stewart puts out.  Sure to become a classic album of Christmas songs.
B00ARAO720|4.0|\\"Premium Rush\\" mixes elements of movies like \\"Vantage Point,\\" \\"Breaking Away\\" and \\"Fast and Furious.\\" If this combination appeals to you, then by all means race to the theater or buy this movie now. There is not a moment wasted in this taut thriller as it starts at 6:30 P.M., jumps back to 4:30, brings us to 5:45, then jumps to a different character earlier at 1:30 that afternoon. All of these pieces come together to help explain what happened at the critical 6:30 juncture of the movie, which then propels us to the ending.<br /><br />All the actors are fine, but the real star is the cinematographer who takes us whizzing through crowded NYC streets on the heels and wheels of the bike messengers that are at the heart of the movie. Do we need to believe that Joseph Gordon-Levit is really riding the bike in long scenes? Of course not! Did we really believe Christopher Reeve was flying? No. Do we really think Sylvester Stallone was getting punched in Rocky 3? No. Do we really think Sharon Stone wasn't wearing....Yeah, we do.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fun movie, and doesn't pretend to be anything pretentious. Let yourself enjoy this ride.
B004TI5N38|3.0|It is an ok read, but not up to his usual standards.  Have no problem putting it down and coming back to it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love that I can set the alarm and have it repeat through the week while having different alarms for Saturday and Sunday.  I can pick my alarm tone so it matches my needs and no more worries!  No more having to remember to set my alarm each day,yeah!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted as I didn't like handling my Kindle directly.  It stands up and feels like a high quality hardback when holding it to read.  And the lovely purple color is terrfic.  This is a great buy especially considering the price.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This is a thought provoking read that explains much about our inner thoughts and our society. I would recommend it to the quiet and loud for better understanding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was a fun entertaining game .. I have had so much fun playing it<br /> I hope more games like this come out...
B0083Z614S|4.0|Should be required reading for school kids.  Was required when I was young.  Don't like having to write a review
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app I have ever purchased in my entire life. There is a avatars named Prince k who I am saving up for, he is an awesome arab. I rate this 5 out of 5. If you disagree, you should consult a psychiatrist or a physician immediately. Make sure they have graduated from at least Yale university. Have fun people, and don't hate o. The app!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best running game ever!!! I am so addicted :-) I have tried so many other running games and no one can hold a candle to this game. I highly recommend this game to any one who loves a challenge...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Awesome read<br />Not as gruesome as I was hearing from others talking about it. Now I have to read the others!
B006H5120E|5.0|I recently bought a smart, 3D TV and have been perchasing some 3D movies to watch. I love my new toy and love this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game at least  20 times a night. I try to get the letters every night! I also try to complete two of the three challenges every night.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I recently bought a smart, 3D TV and have been perchasing some 3D movies to watch. I love my new toy and love this movie.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|This book is a great book for an aspiring writer or a student.  It is a good reference book the basics that are easy to forget.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is amazing. I have enjoyed her music since theyshe  first aired on American Idol. I have most of the cds released since the beginning of her career.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell calculates and and analyzes statistics that create a norm for the very successful; the outliers in society. The problem is that many parents are so abuzz with these patterns that they are attempting to make successes out of their children. (Darn shame happiness doesn't get factored in) Gladwell does not present statistics or examples of outliers of his formulas, of which I'm certain there are many. So this is an interesting but simplistic presentation. It is enjoyable reading. But as you read, consider the outliers of his formulas!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Music of Nashville /Great music ! I love the show and the music is excellent and professionally done by actors !
B000NY12CI|5.0|I thought this was a good book--well written and thought provoking.  It makes one appreciate how lucky we are to live in the U.S.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I have enjoyed this artist's music since they first aired. I have most of the cds released since the beginning of their career.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway that much I am Going to say that it is the best game in the world. If I could I would put 100 stars but I couldn't.<br /><br />  I LOVE SUBWAY SERIES!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm completely obsessed with this game! My whole family is obsessed with this game! My teenage son plays on his Droid Razr phone, my 12 yr old daughter plays her ipad2 and I play on my KindleFire. Works great on all three and we love the new Rio update.Definite winner!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The book is a little slow at the beginning, but then it picks up and it's well worth your time!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Wonderful dog lover story.  Written well enough to bring tears to your eyes.  Causes us to think from the perspective of a dog.
0345803493|1.0|I agree with everything negative already written about \\"Fifty Shades...Dragged Out\\". Repetitive dribble. I ended up flipping through after the first 100 pages but never found anything to hold my attention so I gave up. I don't even care enough to find out what happens in the end. I'm so glad library books are free! As for \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\", that's how I feel knowing I don't have the need to pick that one up.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't stop after reading The Hunger Games.  I ordered this one as soon as I was through with The Hunger Games.
B00992CF6W|3.0|So I was going to buy this app but it doesn't update quickly enough, and while its a good app in progress I could get it from other places for free &amp; totally legit. I just hope the creators of this app realize just how far behind this app is and start updating it more. I add a plus to the features of the neather reactors (though it needs some work), and the spawn animals. As for requests for this game I would consider making the game not so based around building things from wood and cobble stone and start gearing it towards 'advantional create your own story' type of crafting, also I would appreciate no monsters spawning in my HOUSE where I sleep. Additionaly neather glowstone on the ceiling and lava pacthes in the floor should be added to the neather reactor.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Had to order Mockingjay as soon as I completed Catching Fire.  I thought this series would be slow reading.  I finished all 3 books in 3 weeks (very fast reading for me with working, family, and other obligations).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun and keeps you intertained for some time.if you like horses then this game will be good for you. the only downside is that its really hard to get gems.other then that its a great game :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't think I would like the book or the movie. A friend convinced me to read the book and I love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great.I can spend hours on this.its great for killing time and the effects are great.I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves horses
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun more instructions w ould be great<br />To make it easier to know what and how to do the tasks
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Heard him sing on TV, immediately went and bought the CD.  Was playing it last night when picked up friend and as she got in the car said, &#34;love it&#34; have to have it too.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest but find this app freezes often on my Kindle Fire snd must be uninstalled snd reinstalled. My wifi connection is great,  so it has to be the app.When it is working properly, I love it.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This cover protects my kindle very well.  It is colorful, very sturdy and has shown no damage in over a year of use.

B00A8KJK7G|3.0|Wow! This is what kids want: A black and white claymation-like story set in the 1950's based on a 1940's film they never saw. I enjoyed it more than the kids who were too busy taking pictures of their privates and posting on Facebook to care about the movie.<br /><br />What was with the cat poop the girl was holding? Why did all the bad kids have French accents?<br /><br />What was with dead Sparky rotting like a zombie? Frankenstein never did that. I thought the names were a bit cliche for adults, and the kids who could enjoy the film wouldn't understand them. All the kids looked spooky and like their pets, which I liked. The girl with Mr. Whiskers was my favorite.<br /><br />This is a film the kids will watch once and enjoy and grow out of real fast.

030726999X|5.0|The first book in this trilogy was difficult to get through the first 60 or so pages but after that I couldn't put any of the 3 books down and wished that Stieg Larsson had not passed away because he would have become a favorite author  from whom I would not want to miss any of his works.  Exciting and an interesting study of human nature.

1439177791|5.0|ONe of the best books I have ever read in my life. For all, for the most part.Just a wonderful person.
0446677450|2.0|When I read this kind of a book, I am always reminded of Steve Martin: \\"So you want to get rich? Here's what you do. First, go out and get yourself a million dollars....\\" I've known just as many people who have lost everything investing in real estate as those who have made millions. I tend to believe the old proverb, \\"The rich and the poor have this in common; God made them both.\\" I've known brilliant, self-disciplined people who wound up completely broke while other, not so ambitious, not very intelligent people have become wealthy beyond all expectations, even their own. Both my grandfather and my father earned and lost millions, while I have found wealth in family, friends and helping the less fortunate, and even though I have never been wealthy, I have never lacked for anything either.<br /><br />So having said all of that, I watched friends try to put the plans laid out in this book to use, and in every case, something unforeseeable happened to put an end to their profits. Either they bought something they could not afford, or they lacked the money to properly maintain the property, lost their jobs, got divorced or some other unforeseen calamity came upon them to spoil their dream. Think about the people you know who have made money. I will bet you that none of them made that money because they followed the advice offered by a book written by someone who got rich writing a book about getting rich.People become wealthy because they do something that people are willing to buy during a particular period of time and they invest in businesses that are profitable during the time they have invested in that business. Much of this depends upon chance and the social circles a person runs in. A person who focuses all of his efforts on getting rich will end up broke. Most people who become wealthy and stay wealthy usually have some kind of a mission besides making money. Many of them have altruistic dreams of making the world a better place and the money just seems to increase with every enterprise they invest in. Forget the book. Find a mission that gives you, and others, pleasure, and if you get rich doing it, all the better.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|From the beginning of the novel, you are transported deep into the heart of the USSR.  Characters are well developed, captivating plot, and a well woven story.  Excellent read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is a awesome app. get it if you like temple run. so much detail. get it. its awesome.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great read, very enjoyable! Looking forward to the next book in this series. I thought Tooth of the Tiger would be hard to improve on.
B008NEVPCC|4.0|Pretty happy with this product...ordered it said it was gonna be here at a every late date & before you knew it was in the mailbox early making a very pleased & happy teenager...
B007G51UV0|5.0|I bought this board to build a new system. No regrets in buying this board, it has two pci slots which I need for my WinTV card and Creative Labs sound card.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I loved the dictionary. I thought that it would have been better with sign language, but I know that not all dictionaries have them.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|We rented this film and enjoyed it so much, we purchased a copy for friends. It is amazingly produced, the visuals are spellbinding. It is not a happy story. It is a fictional account of an actual climb which ended in tragedy. The movie is splendid, sit on the edge of your seat, movie making.  We particularly enjoyed the short &#34;extra&#34; where the movie makers show you how they made the movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I had to have it last winter and couldn't wait. It was great. Now on to season #3. What will happen next?
0061537969|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, from the first page to the last. Who could resist a book written by a dog who has so much insight into the foibles of humankind. It's an easy read and was so good, I immediately ordered and sent a copy to my sister. I recommend it highly.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I downloaded this for my 6 year old.  She absolutely loves this.  There are so many choices and she can really use her imagination!  Easily worth it!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Can you say Frankenwheat? Reading this book greatly expanded my knowledge of the history of wheat hybridization and its resulting ill effects on human health and digestion.  The author included careful source documentation throughout, vital for authenticity when one is promoting seemingly radical theories.<br /><br />The recipes in this book led me to Davis' accompanying book, Wheat Belly Recipes.  My family and I started a low wheat diet a month ago; we've all dropped pounds and feel much better.  That sounds corny but it's real - we feel leaner (clothes fit better), are sleeping well, we don't miss feeling bloated, and most importantly, we don't get the food cravings we used to.<br /><br />My only dislike of this book was the author's going on at length to reiterate his theories.  I thought he could have said the same thing with fewer words.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|they kindle app store has been doing really good lately they have been getting new and updated app very fast but I am so happy they got this app the first day it came out thank you so much kindle app store keep up the good work
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|The love story  \\"sounded\\" doomed from the get-go.  Although it was clear that the female lead was not going to leave her family, it just didn't make sense to me that she was able to resume life with her husband after Dawson's death. Disappointing.
0439023483|5.0|My granddaughter love the book. She's (10) yrs. old. She finished the book in 2 days. I should have order the trilogy set.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Too much sex.  Upgrade the morals.  Not very realistic.  Put in some old time values.  It is okay to be a virgin.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps me and my kids coming back for more. Im so glad that we go this game for our kids it keep them entertained for hours.
B001JIHGO0|4.0|It was a fun movie to watch on a friday night. The rapid-fire crossbow he used on occasion was pretty cool. The special effects are about 8 years old or whatever and still were impressive by todays standards. Dialog won't exactly win an Oscar, but who cares? It was fun watching the various bad creatures get a *pap *pap *pap *pap body full of arrows.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|One of Grisham's better books - certainly the best he's written in the last several years.  I recommend it to Grisham fans.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Be sure to hang on every scene in the begging. I enjoyed the film but missed a few key points my wife had to explain later. Even with that I enjoyed it a lot.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Very well done. I have always liked the musical, even the movie version. My daughter enjoys musicals and likes this one quite well, even with its dark and suspense-filled plot.<br />The vendor did a good job and got it to me lickety split.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I had to work the weekend so I rented this to keep the wife entertained. She texted me as I was arriving at work and she said the movie wasn't for her with the gyrations and plodding plot. I didn't see it (I wanted to keep my man card) but as my wife is a huge Tatem fan (Did I spell that guy right?) Whatever. Her number 1 fan told me it was crap. Take her review for what it is worth.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It's a very good movie to watch with the little ones. I enjoy it and was laughing thought out the movie.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My wife wanted me to watch this. I hate Glee-Type shows or movies where people sing or break out in sing while doing the dishes. But this was pretty good despite all that. My wife lived it and I was glad she &#34;Forced&#34; me to watch it. After 5 minutes I was bee-bopping and enjoying the performances.
B004I744AS|5.0|Very user friendly and far more entertaining than i imagined, this app is opened daily because of its multitude of fun. No crashes or issues. Great on my verzon lucid
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|In my honest opinion, the pace was slow, even for an &#34;Action&#34; movie. I found myself having to re-watch scenes because I fell asleep.
034580404X|2.0|I just got the book! Great! three books at an excellent price, but when I opend the package (great job amazon!) the books that I found feel very cheap and fragil. Even though I was a expecting a paperback books the cover are just to thin for  my liking. They feel like cheap religious propaganda books...eww. But on the other hand I have all three
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am so happy,  because I can play minecraft anywhere I go! Its great,  and I 'm playing online, alone, and with my brothers.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is awesome I really liked perfect second book I could read again and again it s AMAZING can't wait to read the next
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters are amazing, the social intricacies delightful and as always Maggie Smith is spectacular - as are the rest of the cast.
0786939532|5.0|The language is just beautiful the prose flows lyrically.<br />The matriarchal society of this fantasy world is very different to that of our own society but unfortunately it is not too difficult to imagine. As a generalisation of this world, there is not compassion, mercy, empathy.<br />The characters are all extremely well written but as readers we are left with three definite favourites - Drizzt, Zaknafein and Guenhwyvar, I will leave you to read it for yourself to find out why.<br />The battle scenes are well described and real.<br />The complex relationship structure within this novel is extremely well written and draws the reader in, you will quickly begin to take sides.<br />I absolutely loved the ending of this book and will not be waiting long before I get my hands on the next in the series.<br />If you are a fan of fantasy then go out now and buy this book - start a new adventure.<br /><br />A definite 5 stars - total escapism and fantasy.
6304698623|5.0|Well-written, well-acted, emotional and captivating story about the enduring hope of a little girl separated from her father. It has been created so well with deep sentiment without being overbearing. The well-placed bits of humor through the movie keep it from being too dramatic. I have loved this movie since I was young (my father bought it for me) and even as an adult I am still touched by the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game , my boyfriend got me addicted to it, is fun and there's always things you have to unlock, or challenges you have  to do to get a higher level. LOVE IT!!!!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Excellent, fast moving story.  Continues with the sage of the Ryan family and the supporting cast of clandestine operators.  Enjoyed it.
B009POCFTG|3.0|Matthew McConaughey is one of my favorite actors.  Add Gina Gershon (OMG she is sexy), and Thomas Hayden Church (all actors were good in this), and you have a fun movie.  I was eager to hear each of their lines, and watch them ply their craft.  Well done.  Yet...the movie is dark.  Almost all characters you would avoid in real life.  I'm guessing that the mood/place you're in, in life,  will determine if you like this movie, but that's not unusual.  Overall I can't help but feel that there could have been some more downtime in this movie...less dialog...more chance for viewers to think.  Not sure if I want to or will want to see it again.
0451169514|2.0|So yeah.. what do I even say about this!?<br />The first half of the book for me anyway was slow but not bad it kept me interested enough with the mystery behind it etc.. The second half of the book was actually pretty good. Then there was the ending.. WOW.. I am starting to think that has to be one of the stupidest and worst endings ever!<br />There was a lot the bothered me about the last 100 pages or so but here are a few. *Spoiler* IT was a spider made from a turtle who barfed it up!? REALLY!? They kill IT or at least run IT off for awhile by biting it's tongue in their minds? It just doesn't seem right at all... I mean I was really expecting something much more. So after they do all this they can't find their way back out of the sewer system, so what is the solution to this? Beverly sleeps with all of the boys! Why!? What did this serve? How did this make Eddie know how to get out. It was so just out of place and not needed. Not to mention really, really made me not like Beverly at all . I am sorry but I do not want to read about 11 year old having sex one after another with one girl! *End Spoiler*<br />I love, love Stephen King so giving this only 2 stars is really hard for me but I really struggled with this. I even liked Gerald's Game! I know that was not his most popular but this book was really, for me at least just really bad. I was not scared once, not even a little bit I didn't even feel real suspense at any point in this book.<br />IT really did not need to be as long as it was either. There was so much that could have been cut out and took nothing from the story at all.<br />If you do decide to read this I don't advise getting the kindle edition. The formatting is horrible for it.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|A little different from their other albums, but it definitely is a good different!<br /><br />This a definitely a must buy album!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|My son and daughter-in-law wanted me to see this so badly  when I went to visit that they paid to see it again in a theater while I was there.<br />This movie was so enjoyable and humorous that I looked forward to seeing the Expendables 2 movie when it came out last year  which features similar aging action stars in interesting plots with lots of action and explosions!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like that it fills the Kindle Fire screen and is easy to navigate all the other screens.  I can find a weekly forecast, direct the satellite map down to the street level, keep track of other areas of the country, find a video forecast and more.
1423136802|5.0|This set is enjoyed by my sons who will reread it every once in a while.  Getting them to read is always a plus!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play Solitaire on my pc at home, so it was natural that I get it for my new Kindle Fire.  There were no problems at all and I'm very happy!
B000ID37SQ|1.0|This was required for one of my son's college cinema courses to compare with a 1930's (?) version.<br />I felt it was too violent but truthfully did not watch it except for briefly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love having this calculator on my Kindle Fire, and I love that it is as large as a desk model and easy to use. I really like the backspace key and the calculation you have entered shows up underneath the readout.  Love it!
B0098460O4|5.0|WONDERFUL and so enjoyable to listen to, which I have MANY times.  I would highly recommend it to anyone. Thanks
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love to play Spider on my pc at home, so it was natural that I get it for my new Kindle Fire.  There were no problems at all and I'm very happy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my wifes order<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and very pleased with this as my first book on my new Kindle.<br />Elsie :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The grandkids have played Angry Birds for quite a while now, so I thought I'd see what the fun was all about when I got my Kindle Fire this year.  I love the challenge!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks can do no wrong here, this book, much like his others tugs at your heart strings and makes you feel as though you know the characters from the start.loved it.
B00916TU00|2.0|The first two weeks i got it, i kept it in the cd player and somehow it broke i suggest to buy it somewhere else
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Now that I have read this book I'll be able to see the movie and hope that is is as good as the book.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|After setting up the controls, the eagle eye converter will make your FPS experience closely comparable to a PC setup. It is the only way to play BF3. I recommend this product to any former PC players.<br /><br />Cons: I have on 2 occasions had the mouse stop functioning properly. As if it doesn't react to being moved. A simple reset takes care of the issue and gets it working again. When you first layout the controller for the software, it takes time to remember all the keys you assigned to operate the PS menu and other options. For example, my spacebar is my &#34;X&#34; button, P is my start buttion, O is my selection button, R is my square button, ect.<br /><br />It is difficult to fly planes and choppers in BF3<br /><br />I would and have recommended this product to friends. For those PC players out there, the PS3 controller will never suffice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a really cool game with building mobs and always new updates. I love it and always play it. yeahoooos!
B0089Q1TPM|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I've owned it on multiple formats, including VHS, DVD (twice) and now Blu-Ray (twice). Unfortunately, this version of the movie (as gorgeous as it looks), lacks much new content; just a new retrospective documentary.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you don't own this at all on Blu-Ray, go ahead and get this one
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Everybody can relate to at least one character in this book, which draws you in. If you relate to the main character, you wish you were as in tune to the world around you as he is.
034580404X|2.0|As $$ value for 3 books go-this would be a bargain, but I was quiet disappointed in the on-and-on-and-on story line-the whole story should have been told in one thin book! It reads just like the Harlequin Romance stories I read as a teenager-only difference-these paperbacks are pornographic. After reading two of these-I couldn't bring myself to waste the time to read the third book- sorry i bought the set-although I buy/read dozens of books a year-I'd advise buying these one at a time to see if you want a second or third one!
B0087YYHZU|4.0|My kid loves this movie add that its clean and I'm a happy mom. Wish it had the DVD too though.
1439165653|4.0|A great read about the connection between food, culture, and family. Its knowledge of cuisine was amazing. Most importantly, it illuminated human nature - its flaws and achievements with sensitivity and humour.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I literally love this series. Truthfully I'm a major Stephen King reader but the supernatural world created in the mortal instruments is captivating....
B0018LMZOO|5.0|Great album, always loved it, thanks for providing. Only had it on vinyl, now I have it on CD. Cant stop listening to it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|my girlfriend  got me started on this game.i cant seem to put it down.the only complaint i have is it takes to long for the energy to refill.fix this problem and i will have no issue giving it a 5 star rateing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is great. I'm 70 and not as nimble as you young ones but I'm doing OK. I'm on level 6 and can't stop playing until I have to when the battery needs charging.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I rented the movie for my kids to watch.  I watched it with them and I enjoyed it myself.  It is a movie I would not mind buying at some point for my children.
1451695195|1.0|Thoroughly disappointed in this book.  Alexander must have had some sort of experience but his review falls flat and does not shed light about the possibility of life beyond.  I was very discomforted by his near bragging about the love he felt from the prayers of his children and family and that their efforts are what pulled him back.  What about the 1,000's of others out there who had the same kind of prayers and love and yet they died?  He did not address this.  The spirit of the book strikes me as self-centered.  It's filled with scientific notions that explain nothing.  If this is your first book about near death experiences there are so many others out there that are far more moving and heartfelt:  Raymond Moody's \\"Life After Life,\\" Betty J. Eadie's \\"Embraced By The Light,\\" plus Stephen Levine's \\"Who Dies?\\" and books by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|This album is great from start to finish, I only wish it had more songs on the album but that would be the only bad thing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think you should get this game! I got it and I play it every day. The settings change to like,Rio and New York!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed it and it help fill out the collection. I need to write a minimum of ten words.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love ,love, love subway surfers it's fun to earn coins and new characters like robots,zombies,aliens,punk rock kids,city kids,ocean surfers,princes,and so much more!plus it's free!:)
B001UV4XIS|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed it and it help fill out the collection.  I need to write a minimum of ten words.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the  best game ever but sometimes it has glitches.so much fun I should Sat you should get it.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|I'm still finishing the book but I can say this is an interesting and provocative dive into the psychology of motivation.  I like how the Daniel Pink broke it down into Motivation 1.0, 2.0, and now 3.0 (the drive for self actualization), and the implications for companies who can find a way to create an open and creative environment to drive amazingly creative results.<br /><br />My challenge with the book, much like the challenge I had with &#34;Leading Geeks&#34; is that it takes the view that unfettered and unconstrained freedom for analytical/creative people is the panacea for all workplace woes.  It certainly sounds like utopia, but the awful truth of the matter is that there are only a limited spectrum of jobs that either require or benefit from this kind of open-ended motivational approach.  The author uses software developers as a case study many time throughout the book - a good example, but hardly relevant to process owners, small business owners, insurance adjusters, and the other 99% of people who keep our world running smoothly on a day to day basis.<br /><br />I think the observations and examples are useful to learn from, and I have to believe that all people would benefit from having some opportunities to apply creative and individualistic effort to their jobs.  This is a terrific reward system that promotes job ownership and satisfaction.  So my challenge to Daniel Pink - in the remaining parts of the book I have yet to read or in a follow-on tome - is to tell me and the very large population of managers who lead teams of process owners how we can adapt the highly interesting and provocative findings of his research to our daily work.<br /><br />I do recommend this as an engaging and useful addition to a leadership library for those looking to broaden their leadership acumen.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|I never got to play this because even with the settings set to off, there are very loud sounds between scenes.<br /><br />This is VERY annoying.  The game should respect the User settings.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try again, but it's been 4 hours and it's still downloading resources.<br /><br />I'm glad it was free. I usually like g5 games but I had to delete it immediately.
B004PR71JC|5.0|The CD is great and is one CD I bought because I liked the movie and wanted to enjoy the vibe and experience and I did.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I was hoping this would be a real puzzler.  Not so much.  Oh well. I received the item and it was just as advertised with no issues, problems. It came when expected as well.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The CD is nice to me I didn't get a chance to listen to every song but the few I heard was great, and I loved the album cover. Great songs for a bargin.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I read and enjoyed all the novels in the series. This one was a disappointment. The narrative was sluggish and seemed contrived.
B004IJY4L0|3.0|Decent Cd. Good bass and drum. Fun to drive to. Makes the daily commute to and from work fun. Nothing that strikingly stands out from the rest of the DJ's out there.
1401322786|2.0|I admit I am not a Mitch Albom fan. While \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was wonderful, books that followed struck me as less-than-satisfactory handlings of interesting concepts. When I heard about the concept of \\"The Time Keeper,\\" I was intrigued once again. And once again, I was disappointed with the handling of the topic. The story that unfolds herein was disjointed, jumping between characters and time periods. The writing seemed \\"dummied down\\" to me. I did not rejoice are striking descriptions, or smooth dialogue. I just didn't rejoice at all. The concept of Father Time being held captive for his crime of foisting time on humanity had such promise. I hope everyone else derives much more pleasure from this book than I did. As another reviewer stated, I wish I had the time I spent reading this book back to read a different choice. Time is such a terrible thing to waste.<br />Susan V. McDaniel, author of \\"Win When You Lose: A Guide to Successful Dieting,\\" available as an e-book for Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is super fun but on the apple products it updated we kindle users need this to be updated so we can have a sky in stead of just fog
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use it on my kindle fire; normally with few problems.  Once in a while it is really slow loading.  But that's ok! because then I have a chance to get something important done!
B009J2VQSK|3.0|Two songs featured in the trailer and the Diner scene, are not on soundtrack.  The Head and the Heart's, &#34;Lost in my Mind&#34;, (Diner Scene) and The Lumineer's, &#34;Ho Hey&#34;, would have made this a five star soundtrack.  This is a problem with many movie soundtracks, took me awhile to ID the Artists not featured.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Love this book. I have to make myself put up so I can get some sleep at night. It is set in the early 1900's and brings you to another lifetime while your reading. It really was a great book and you find yourself rooting for this sweet family.
1433503794|5.0|My brother has this Bible and after sharing it with me I decided to purchase one of my own.I particularly like the interpretation of each verse.This Bible is particularly easy to understand.and makes it much easier for my Bible Study class.
B008BU70HW|4.0|If you have watched Downton Abbey you will find it is kind of a review of both seasons along with some insight into the characters given by the actors/actresses playing the parts.  It also gives you a short history of the property and the care that is taken with detail and filming.  Interesting,  especially  if you are addicted to the show.
B00A13719E|5.0|I have always been a fan of Christina Aguilera's music.  Although it may take some time, this album really does grow on you.  I love that it is a mix of not only catchy beats but power ballads as well.  Overall, I think that this is a great album and definitely worth buying!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|One of the BEST shows on tv, hands down.  Season Two was a bit weaker than season one, but they are making up for it this year!!  After watching a few weeks on PBS, I could not take the suspense any longer and ordered the DVD (and have several friends hoping to borrow it once I am done).  This season was total redemption for a slightly yawn inspiring year two - great great stuff, looking forward to #4!!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I love it. 15 minutes isn't enough. I think it's awesome. An hour would be good. If you like Minecraft  this is good for you.
B000P7V45S|5.0|Before Genesis went Pop.  As a high school student in the early 70's, I preferred progressive rock such as Yes, King Crimson, and Genesis, and this is still my favorite genre -- Sort of a combination of rock and classical.<br />Trick Of The Tail is the last Genesis album I would bother with.  This album and Battle Of Epping Forest are definitely when they had the best balance and production, although I have all their previous albums and listen to them regularly.  Great road trip music.<br />I always buy CD's so I can use my purchase however I choose.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|awsome game and ease to play. ur basic hack and slash but loads of fun with armorial upgrades' potions and magic upgrades
1423151054|5.0|Get to see a flip book shot from each of the 9 old men. Each page is a photo of the actual pencil drawing page used blemishes, notes and all. A great way to study the subtlety of master animators frame by frame.
235250080X|2.0|The author did a great deal of research and the photos of the original equipment are very good - but the level of detail required for a serious student is not there.  I would say it's a good overview, but titling it as an \\"encyclopedia\\" is a stretch.  I would probably have rated it three stars except for the price.<br /><br />I am still looking for a reference that discusses construction, materials, dates of manufacture/issue, etc.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|The characters come to life and are exactly like they appear on TV.  Sarcasms and expressions made me laugh. Good story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I anxiously awaited the release of the series on AMC after hearing they were making it and, for the most, part, I've been pleased.  there were times in the second season where the show lulled a bit (but that really didn't bother me).  Season 3 has been consistently great from episode-to-episode, keeping wanting for me.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is my new must read author.  His plots always have interesting, believable twists.  It will take me a while to work through his whole body of work.
B003QS67F0|5.0|Nolan is a great filmmaker and this is a great film about some magicians and their obsession with beating one another by doing the best trick. That's not a great description but just watch the movie and enjoy it.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|This was a gift for my 6 year old daughter who is starting to enjoy music. The lyrics aren't inappropriate and the music is fun. A good beginning for a child moving up from Dora CDs.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Great story about a really interesting man. Kind of a truth is stranger than fiction type thing. Kinda. I'm bad at getting my thoughts into words so I will just say it's fascinating and touching and I recommend it.
B008IGANGO|1.0|Not good<br />Not original characters not worth watching<br />Very very very very bad<br />Want refund ofmy money<br />Not worth your time r money
B0086700CM|4.0|Pretty fun game to play. I guess there is a sequel now so you might as well play that instead. But this one is still good.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|It is a great listen.  If you did not see the movie this is a suitable substitute<br />Even the uneducated will enjoy it.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|This is a fantastic film. Some people don't like the ending or get a little confused about it. It really isn't that ambiguous or anything, but everybody's brain is different. My favorite film of the year for 2011. I could go on and on but I'm not good at putting thoughts into words. Please enjoy the movie.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|As a native Virginian I have read every Scarpetta novel and had the pleasure of meeting the author at a Richmond Nascar race.  I am amazed at the research and enjoy each new read.  I would like to see more character involvement, a good read but not one of my favorites.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is such a good novel. You will laugh, cry, get angry, frustrated, so many emotions you may feel.. a good story , one I could not put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Free and fantastic. Keeps building. Keeps you wanting more. Great game. There are so many different choices and power ups. It gives you challenges and goals
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My sister gave me Season 1 and I immediately got hooked so I ordered Season 2.  I finished watching it 5 minutes before Season 3 began!  Love it.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|The director's long cut gives an idea of what the film was meant to be... on a giant screen. Unfortunately, it came out in the shorter version, good enough but insufficient.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This made playing the Minecraft &#34;Pocket&#34; edition much easier to play.  It is an EPIC add-on!  I highly recommend it!
B008B4KVS8|5.0|Transcription to Blu-Ray honors the grandeur of Cinerama. The polar sets become three times as obvious. Very, very, very funny!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks.  It is a hard to put down book. You can't go wrong.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|...the film will last forever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and...(now I have reached the minimun of words to submit. &#34;Hecha la ley, hecha la trampa&#34;, they say in spanish..
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was impressed with this saga. It started off a little slow, but once it got going it never stopped. There were some good twists and turns. It had intrigue and action and kept me interested and not wanting to put it down. I'm not really a fan of apocalypse stories, but this one was different from others I've read. I would definitely recommend it and can't wait for the next in the saga.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|.. and excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent film (they said I need a minim of words to submit; what a stupidity! Thus the abondance of &#34;excellents&#34;, how about that..
B005PK553C|5.0|It is a bit gory at times, but this is the greatest horror show I can remember for the longest time, and it has great twists and an amazing cast of actors. IMHO, season one is better than season two.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|For me, I thought this book was a little different from other Sparks' books that I have read.  I didn't especially like the turn of events at the end, but it made for interesting reading.  I plan to see the movie when it comes out.
159562015X|3.0|The book is in excellant shap bu the access code card wasn't in the book. And It was delivered on time but my new class that requires this book starts in 3 days. I don't know if I have to purchase a whole new book.
0316286850|5.0|This book has it all! If you want to learn or want to become a self taught makeup artist this book is for you!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you don't like court room back and forth, much like my friend who asked my opinion on this book, then don't buy it.  I, personally liked the book.  The ending was surprising, and left me feeling undone?
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book is simply a beautiful disaster, the title says it all. Once I picked it up I wasnt able to put it down.
0062127241|4.0|I really enjoyed this book up to the point where Keith Moon died.  Then the tone seemed to change and Pete revealed himself to be an egotistical, philandering drunk.  It's almost as if someone else began to write the book.  I went from really liking him to being completely put off.  He seemed to imply that he had envisioned electronic music, the internet, MP3's and the downfall of hard media.  It was all a bit much to believe.  By the time I reached the last chapter I found I didn't really care if I finished reading or not.  That doesn't mean it was a bad book, but your view of him may change depending on how much you knew about him beforehand.
B00992CF6W|4.0|with me it wouldn't update so I learner form a friend that uninstalling it might help and when I tried that Ann. then tried to reinstall it it wouldn't download
0393343405|5.0|Fascinating historical and philosophical story that too easily assumes that the world has become modern in the author's sense of the term &#34;modern.&#34;
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Great detail about a part of the country I know little about. Would recommend it to any one that asked.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this  book last year my teacher in 4th grade  read it to us  and I loved since then loved it
B00005JLH3|5.0|One of my favorites and I am sharing it with my granddaughter who is taking drum lessons and with her music class.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a well written series about a president I knew little about. It is interesting and the actors were well cast
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I ordered this case because the price was right. I knew in advance that the cover has to be open when charging and that hasn't been a problem.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Watch the trailer if you need a synopsis, I'll get to the point. It was a pleasure to see Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play the same guy. They both brought enough of themselves to the role while also adopting mannerisms unique to each other. This was nice, and at first the movie looked to be promising, but then it just got confusing and never recovered. The action was fast, gritty, and intense, the dialogue was clever and exactly what you expect from a Bruce Willis film, but none of it made any sense half-way through the film. It's a shame. There are much better sci-fi action flicks out there. Don't waste your money on this one unless you just feel compelled to watch a perfectly brilliant conceit go completely to waste.
1932100660|4.0|He said it is very helpful. I have nor personally read the book, yet! A lot of helpful information. Will read soon.
B005LAIISA|5.0|The gangs all together again with the addition of Manny & Ellie's teenage daughter and a few other new characters on another riviting and very funny adventure.  Definitely a great addition to our Ice Age collection.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|All I can say about this CD is this is Cohen at his best.  I chose this after seeing the Concert on my local PBS station.
0316174483|5.0|I gave this as a gift to a kinder and first graders...I think they loved it...I just know I also have my own copy and LOVE it!
B003L77GGA|5.0|I love the Smallville series and getting it on DVD is the best. Tom Welling is great as Superman and I really like how this series gives a back story to Superman for those of us who didn't read the comic books.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the game is great but there is a terrible bug that makes your device think that the app is uninstalled when it is, in fact, installed
B008C20TDG|5.0|Very easy to read and follow. A must if your thinking about doing the Whole30 program. Their website is good but this book really has much more information and background. I am 2 days in and looking forward to healthier me and my performance at the gym improving. This is a real life approach to health not a supplement filled, expensive experience. I will recommend to my friends after the 30days are over and results can be seen.
