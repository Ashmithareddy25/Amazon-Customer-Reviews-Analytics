B003TVMIDO|5.0|Great set and nicely packaged. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.<br />A tribute to John Lennon and well done Yoko.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I watched this as it came out online and have been a fan ever since. I had to have the dvd and the soundtrack. :)
B0091X2K0A|4.0|First time I watched it, all i remember was the initial scene and thought it was just another war movie.  This time around, I picked up more of the themes involved and definitely enjoyed the movie more.
B001KT6JPA|3.0|It felt bland overall and the suspnse wasnt really there, te detectives story/life did not feel believable. But I would watch it once and only really recommend it for Hannibal fans
B00AG297GK|3.0|The Dictator has its moments but the plot is definitely a weak one.  Watching it on Amazon Prime vs going out to the movie theaters was definitely the right call.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game with some tough to solve brain teasers<br />enjoy solving puzzels to move to the next level<br />have fun
B0046B3QTG|4.0|had to see it again, in preparation for going to the theatre to see Despicable Me 2 that is coming out next week.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This is an excellent fast pace game; great for older children and adults.  You have levels you have to reach to earn three stars; you are also asked to take over neighboring resturants for a time with your grandmother.  This is great fun, however, you have to pay to continue playing (cooking) at other resturants.  Not sure why they call it Cooking Dash Deluxe if you have to purchase a higher level to play.l
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have enjoyed each of the Jack reacher novals and look forward to reading the next one. I will get another on this week
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This is a cute game, nice animation and interactive.  You can upgrade your cafe, hire staff and upgrade their performance; however you can only go so far with out paying out real money... then you have to purchase tokens to make upgrade and or hire certain characters.  Over all this is a fun game for children and adults.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found it to just the right amount of challenge and fun. I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves puzzles.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This is a cute game, one that young children would like.  Older children would get bored after a while, light animation, same ole routine.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I ordered this movie to add to my library of great movies.  THIS series of Batman movies is the better of all of those produced.  This movie ROCKS!!! From start to finish!! Ledger's character is amazing. Totally worth the purchase.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game but some of the clues are too vague such as the trick to get the key in level 10.
030758836X|1.0|This book came so highly recommended by folks that often exchange books back and forth with me - but I found this book just awful!  I finished it just so I would know the ending but oh how I wished I had never started it.  :(
B000YABIQ6|3.0|Basically the dvds are good but there are 2 discs that stick and I have to be patient till they unstick and continue the show. And when I say stick I mean freeze.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I loved this movie and was pleased with my purchase. I have watched it numerous times and hope they make another movie where they  tell us where she goes next-like if she ever makes it to their home world; & if so, would the Engineers be friendly or hostile...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|When I first picked up this book I thought it was gonna be a sappy love story... wrong ! This book is absolutely AH-mazing. I love it from. beginning to end. totally have to see the movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome if you love challenging puzzles!! Just needs to hurry up with more levels so the challenge can continue!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great app. If you love the computer version you'll love this mobile version. Keep in mind that it's the alpha version so there's not as much things as th  computer version. Overall this is a very nice app to have definitely worth the money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very addictive. I was upset when I got to the last level.  would like to see more of this game.  really made me think.
B008GFI4V8|4.0|Peter Jackson and friends apply their epic vision to LotR's second chapter, although this material doesn't sparkle in quite as many ways. While the sweeping vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable, a noticeably slowing plot means we're seeing more of them, for longer periods of time, than in the previous installment. Rather than the perfect balance of action, adventure and fantasy seen in Fellowship of the Ring, much more time is devoted to romance, pontification and elaboration in The Two Towers, with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very long-winded, literary feel. There's still room for a bit of warfare, of course, with the lengthy battle for Helm's Deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself, but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry. Perhaps that's just a case of too much material in the Extended Edition, though. Andy Serkis is a revelation as Gollum, while Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo is an improvement over his one-dimensional turn in the first film. It's also worth mentioning that the CGI creature effects, which looked so convincing on the screen back in '02, don't benefit from the crystal clarity of a Blu-Ray translation.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|World War Z is a big budget horror film that imagines a theoretical zombie apocalypse as an extinction event on par with an asteroid impact (Armageddon) or climate change (Day After Tomorrow) or a geological catastrophe (The Core). By combining two genres the film makers made a movie that succeeded as both a horror film and a disaster film.<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays Garry Lane, a former top secret United Nations investigators who spent years working in many of the world's most dangerous hot spots. Exactly what Gary did for the UN isn't completely explained, but suffice it to say that it involved lots of danger and time away from his family. When the movie begins, he's retired from his dangerous life and enjoying the role of stay-at-home dad. He's on a family trip when zombies begin running amuck. Stranded in a strange city, with zombies biting and turning everyone they see, he must lead his family to safety.<br /><br />Help comes in the form of a UN helicopter that takes Gary and his family to a U.S. Navy ship. But sanctuary comes with a price. Non essential personnel cannot stay on the ship. So to keep his family safe he agrees to lead a mission to determine the source of the zombie virus outbreak. That mission takes him first to Korea, then to Israel (where Israeli Defense Forces are protecting Arab refugees from the zombie swarm), to France...all in search of clues to the outbreak's origin.<br /><br />I've never been a big Brad Pitt fan, but he did a great job playing the quick thinking UN investigator. He also had well written script to work with.<br /><br />A Note for the zombie cinema fans out there. The zombies in World War Z are the fast moving 28 Days Later zombies, not the slow shuffling Walking Dead zombies. Since WWZ was written as much as a disaster film than as a horror film, the writers and director attempt to scientifically flush out the idea of a zombie outbreak, and do a pretty good job of it. I'm glad I saw this movie and recommend it to my friends.ds.
B002RTC93S|5.0|This is one of the best concert BD I have ever seen. The quality was excellent, and I can say I don't have a bad review for the item. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of George Michael.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Kid leaving to Africa, thought I would try out, was very surprised how cool this is. I'm going to get one for myself.  Great service too.
B00BR9XS98|1.0|This is the biggest rip-off I've ever seen! The only true thing in their description is that it is the first book in the game of Thrones series. You will NOT get a signed copy. Nor will you even get a 1st edition. I received a compact 2013 school edition. I can't believe you people can even still sell this or anything on amazon! Unless you like throwing your money away or just like to fill the pockets of complete LIERS, then I suggest you look somewhere else for this book! I bought 2 copy's of this, one for me and then one for a friends birthday. Both are going back! I will also be calling them to see what they have to say for themselves!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These were f****** awesome stories! Kept me on my seat the whole time, loving the adventure and the twists and turns. Can't wait to read more.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|You slice fruit, have fun and repeat. Who doesn't love pretending to be a ninja with mad blade skills?!?!? Only downside is no way to look at your achievements on the Android platform. I have this on the iPad and I can see what achievements I've gotten and what I have yet to get. Now trying to unlock all the blades and scenes without actually giving money to get starfruit. :)
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Read it all in a matter of hours. A great example of what a novella ought to be. I picked it up because I'd finished Elantris and was eager to see another story set in the same world. Was a bit disappointed to see only vague references to some of the eastern cultures in that other book, but it held its own non-the-less.<br /><br />The magic system wasn't as cool as that of the Elantrians, but I am eager to see how it all ties together...eventually.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Another great game from Zepto. Levels were fun and certain boards were challenging . Music is also great but the professor can get a little annoying. Loved it!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The ending wasn't predictable, just unplausable. It was an entertaining read, I've just grown to expect better from John Grisham.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Let me state for the record that I've been a Queensryche fan since I saw the video for Take Hold of the Flame on MTV when I was in high school. I was already a fan of Rush and Iron Maiden and, thus, Queensryche was right up my alley. In the years that followed I got more and more into this kind of music with Queensryche leading me further into the realm of progressive metal with bands like Fates Warning, Dream Theater and Symphony X. Unfortunately, the grunge thing happened and, with the release of Hear in the Now Frontier, and almost any metal band that had long hair and took showers being purged from what was left of MTV, Queensryche's sound started to change. Following this release, lead guitarist and main songwriter Chris DeGarmo left the band and their music really started to suffer. Let me be honest. Queensryche has not put out a decent album in over 10 years. Trying to release a sequel to Operation: Mindcrime was a disaster with things really bottoming out, in my opinion, with the infamous \\"cabaret tour\\". So, if this album sucked at all I would either not be here writing this or I would be here trashing another pathetic effort. This is not that. Whether Geoff Tate was holding the band back or not, I don't know. All I know is this, this is a fantastic record. The songs are great. The sound is great. The playing is great. Todd La Torre is a fantastic singer and brings a great energy to the band. This is not progressive metal in the vein of Dream Theater wankering but Queensryche has never been that. They bring \\"progressive\\" into it with epic songs, atmospheric passages, intelligent lyrics and, yes, great but tasteful musicianship. Every single song on this album is better than anything the band has done in at least a decade. Call it prog, call it metal, call it good hard rock, whatever. This album instantly makes Queensryche relevant again and should silence a certain small group of people trying to act like Queensryche. If you bothered to read this review, youneed this album. Buy it, you won't regret it.
B005USZML4|5.0|Well written story of a bright and engaging kid!  I would recommend this to any parents!  Your kids will love it!
159463176X|1.0|Loved it!  A beautifully written book. Not my favorite of Hosseini's but wonderful nonetheless. It was sad and beautiful.  He is such a great writer.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Grisham always tells a wonderful story that keeps your attention.  You will not want to put this down until you have completed it!  Enjoy!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have played the first hungry shark but this game has nothing on it. As you swim through the game you find a minagery of items and fish. it is such a fun game I recommend it to anyone
B003B02O14|5.0|Grisham provides his usual twists and turns to keep the reader entertained and engaged!  He is as always the master storyteller!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|is a classic.  one of my old time favorites.  i can watch it over and over again!!  wish they still made these type of movies
B003B02PEU|5.0|I would always recommend John Grisham's work for anyone!  He delivers great stories with unusual twists!  Many times surprise endings!!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I liked the series back then...not so much the movies.<br />I didn't catch this version in the theater because it looked really goofy via the trailers.<br /><br />But....after watching a few times, I began to appreciate the quirkiness.<br /><br />A few of the many differences between this movie and the TV series/movie:<br /><br />1. A vampire that looks like a vampire.<br />2. 200 years out-of-time person acts like one (Depp flawlessly uttering a script straight from a Victorian Thesaurus) .<br />3. A real world plotline of sorts.<br />4. This version of Barnabas cares for his family; the previous version slaughters them like cattle.<br />5. A sense of humor...finally.<br /><br />I really didn't want a remake of House of Dark Shadows, a blood-fest of killing everybody that depressed me when it came out. By contrast, the construction worker massacre was bloody, yet brilliantly executed with almost comical visuals. The weed smoking scene was also oddly appropriate for the time, while having a wretched, screaming, but-no-blood-shown climax.<br />Helena Bonham Carter's Julia Hoffman was brutally funny (hypnotizing a vampire is pretty odd twist).<br /><br />Of course Tim Burton and Johnny Depp would humor it up a little! The source material was humorless and needed a fresh perspective, though I could've done without many of the juvenile puns. A serious re-boot was already attempted and it didn't last past one season. The original formula should best remain part of TV history.<br />The music track was very reminiscent of Robert Colbert's scores, without the overbearing soap opera melodramatic sound.<br /><br />So lighten up...I think they did a pretty good job of avoiding recycling a boring gothic vampire story that has been made over and over. While also avoiding an overboard special-effects, slasher flick.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like a challenge and this game brings it. I almost got stuck a few times bout this game forces you to think outside the box. Can't wait for new rooms.
006178480X|5.0|The quote above is the final sentence of the first chapter of James Rollins' latest Sigma Force thriller, The Eye of God.  In other words, it's just another low-stakes drama from this master of disaster.  This time around, the prologue opens in AD 453 with the death of Attila the Hun.  From there, we quickly move to present-day Rome, with our old friends Vigor and Rachel.  (Already, things are off to a good start!)  Vigor is consulting with his niece about a mysterious package he's just received from an old friend--a priest declared dead more than a decade prior.  The package contains an artifact, a human skull etched with Jewish Aramaic.  \\"I believe this relic is an example of early Talmudic magic practiced by Babylonian Jews.\\"  It also contains a book bound in human skin.  And these artifacts are pointing towards a coming apocalypse with a very imminent date.<br /><br />Meanwhile...  At an air force base in California, \\"something's gone wrong.\\"  So says Sigma's Painter Crowe, who happens to be in attendance.  A special camera has been tracking a comet's progress through space, trying to collect \\"proof that the comet was shedding or disturbing dark energy in its wake.\\"  After a few pages of fairly sexy physics talk, remote data is retrieved: \\"It displayed a satellite view of the eastern seaboard of the United States, the photo taken as the satellite blazed a trail across the sky.  It was detailed enough to make out the major coastal metropolises.  Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C.  Every city lay in a smoldering ruin.\\"  So, you've got your ancient prophecies lining up disturbingly with your weird space-time science anomaly prophesies.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are off to the races!<br /><br />Now, I've reviewed a lot of Rollins' novels in the past decade plus, and the reviews are beginning to feel a bit redundant only because Mr. Rollins is so consistent with the strengths of his novels.  So please bear with me as I go over the major bullet points:<br /><br />* I read a lot of this type of science/adventure thriller and I don't think there's another writer out there that can touch Rollins for the complexity of the tales he weaves--and I mean that in an entirely positive way.  Above I alluded to Attila the Hun, the Roman Catholic Church, advanced physics, and Jewish mysticism.  That is merely the tip of the iceberg.  Throw into the mix Genghis Khan, the world's only freshwater seal, exotic locales spanning the globe, magnetic fingertips (So freakin' cool!), St. Thomas, multiverses, and the question, \\"Could the ancient Chinese have had knowledge of events described in the book of Genesis?\\"  In every book, Rollins weaves an astonishing number of incredibly diverse, incredibly cool elements into one cohesive tale.  And usually it hangs together so well, I wonder if he hasn't stumbled onto some secrets of the universe.<br />* Again, I must commend the author on his strong female characters.  I don't think readers are ever disappointed when Rachel and Seichan are both a part of the mix.  The Eye of God introduces several noteworthy new female characters as well.  (And for those of you waiting for something to happen with Gray...  Your wait is over.)<br />* How many different times and ways can I express my love of Kowalski?  This time around he enters with the line, \\"Why does that duck keep looking at me?\\"  Which is just so Kowalski.  I thought he was funnier than ever in this book.  I want to quote all his best lines, but I'll refrain.<br />* Easter eggs!  There are Easter eggs in this novel that refer to a non-Sigma book in the Rollins-verse.  It's not a character this time around.  Really, really fun!<br />* Not just one super-cool author's note at the end describing what's fact and what's fiction, this time there are several of them.<br /><br />Now, this is the point where I usually kvetch about a bunch of nit-picky stuff, but I don't really have any significant complaints this time around.  Once I was going to ding him on a plot element being too outlandish, but as he often does, he followed it up with enough science that I was willing to continue suspending my disbelief.  No, this is a strong novel in the long-running Sigma series.  The plot is fascinating, and I hope it goes without saying that it moves at a lightning pace.  Furthermore, there are significant developments among the major players.  And that's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />I honestly don't know how long James Rollins can possibly come up with these convoluted tales he spins.  Surely he's written about every single interesting thing in the universe by now?  But apparently not.  As long as he keeps writing them, I'm going to keep reading them!n a plot element being too outlandish, but as he often does, he followed it up with enough science that I was willing to continue suspending my disbelief.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Here it is & this is it! The long awaited, and highly anticipated rebirth of a band who's relevancy was lost some fifteen years ago. Queensryche. Gone are the elements that have driven Queensryche to obscurity and gone are the antics of former singer Geoff with his power-plays and his \\"my way or the highway' mentality.<br /><br /> In his place, is Todd La Torre. A drummer turned vocalist who appeared to give new life to this band, and man-oh-man have they delivered! With this release, everything from Q2K to Dedicated to Chaos is gone. The slate has been wiped clean and Queensryche are free to start over with a self titled reboot that reminds people who they once were and who they can be. A foot in the past with another set in the future.<br /><br />If anything, with the events of the past year...with Geoff making one statement after another, with the dismal Frequency Unknown and the embarrassing Operation: Mindcrime 25th tour, the ACTUAL band had to do only one thing and that simply is, to release this album.<br /><br />The music does the talking. The point has been proven. The battle is over. And while November may actually prove the true winner, the people, the fans clearly know who the real Queensryche are.<br /><br />This was well worth the wait. and I'm grateful for Queensryche.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This movie is great fun. It is irreverent and campy. It plays like a graphic novel, but this one is for all of the kids who couldn't quite get it together. Nobody does it alone. They need each other. Kind of nice. I couldn't give this movie 5 stars because there were some holes in production, but I didn't really care a lot because I was having so much fun watching the plot unfold. And that is ultimately why I go to see a movie, to be entertained. Is the violence over the top? Yes, but in a campy way that doesn't make me worry about anyone taking it too seriously. Remember what I said about it reading like a comic or a cartoon? That's what happens in those things. They could never happen in real life. Belief suspended, I plod forward. Watch this movie and be dazzled by little Chloe Grace Moretz who steals the show.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Such a nice dvd.<br />Getting me excited for the next month or so...<br />Robert Pant in concert.<br />A couple weeks later, Jason Bonam!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show takes you back to another time and place.  It is very well done! I highly recommend it to every one.
B00821OX98|5.0|I went into this not expecting much from this series. I mean how good can a television sci-fi series be? I was pleasantly surprised. The character development was solid as well as the arcs within the show. I started watching the series on my Prime account because I had some time to burn. I couldn't put the computer down, I watched all three seasons. Now I have it scheduled on the DVR. You have to suspend unbelief concerning some things (as you should with just about any sci-fi) but overall it is a pretty solid show.
B00364NVOE|5.0|Surprisingly good movie. Kept me interested all the way through the movie. Recommended for everyone. No foul language. The special effects were pretty good.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Perfect movie that I've been trying to watch for a while. Was a huge fan of Borat when it came out, Bruno was so-so, and this just kills it. Excellent movie. Definitely worth watching! Out Loud Laughing moments are present throughout the movie! Definitely watch it
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|The musicianship of this recording is amazing.<br />Norma has never sounded better. I have other recordings<br />and this is one for the ages.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he actually did a great job in this movie. I would watch it again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle game. The graphics were very appealing and the puzzles were entertaining. Only thing wrong..... I want more..make the next one longer.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Even with a FIOS connection, I'm not getting a full HD stream and will end up spending money on a physical copy. It seems unfair that I cannot download it to my computer - I would have to have a Kindle Fire to be able to download it. So this will just sit in my amazon library, gathering digital dust...<br /><br />That said, what a great action movie! A must-see for all action fans.
B00371XIJE|5.0|This was a great movie so touching - have a box of kleenex available<br /><br />The next day after we watched it we went to the train station and saw the memorial for Hachi.  Awesome!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This was a great deal for a astonishing live performance by the Eagles in Melborne Austrailia that just sounds and looks wonderful.<br />If you like the Eagles and have a good HD home theater with 5.1 - 7.2 Surround sound with DTS, then this is a must have. On the other hand if you're looking for alot of flash, dancing, and action on the stage, you will probably be disapointed.  As one of the members says about a published review of another performance where the reviewer said they &#34;loitered&#34; on stage.  But like myself who's also getting long in the tooth, chronologically, They're just too brittle to bounce around anymore.  However, there's very little &#34;lean on the mike stand for 20-40 minutes and bore the audience with your BS&#34; crap. Mostly just one great song after another that sounds better than (IMO) than their studio produced CD's, thanks to their long professional relationship together and ever increasing attention to detail at daily rehearsals.  This is the tightest band I think I've ever seen.  So crank it up! It sounds even better at concert volume.<br /><br />One complaint I do have is the BluRay sound setup defaults to PCM stereo and It doesn't remember when I set it to DTS, although that may be a shortcomming of my player.
B009NY43NY|3.0|When i first started the series I read the first 8 books in 5 days, i was lost in Sookies world. After the first chapter i was disappointed. Then i read and and i thought really this is how this is gonna end. Bar far worst book in the series.
0547848412|5.0|I saw the movie first, and loved it so much that I just had to read the book.<br />This book came fast and it was in perfect condition!<br />The book is sooo awesome, way better than the movie (as it usually goes).<br />A MUST read!
B00CEQ1JOO|3.0|The official (company) photo included of this item is a bald-faced lie.<br /><br />Her skin is a deep purple, not a light purple or white. Her purse, shoes, and shirt are purple, not blue as in shown in the official photos.<br /><br />She's a cutie, but I probably would have waited awhile to get her at a cheaper price instead of jumping on her right away if I'd known she had grape skin instead of pale lavender skin or white skin like the photos made it seem.<br /><br />I thought there was a chance I'd been sold a bootleg until I looked around and managed to find other owner photos instead of the official photos. It seems the official photos are photo-shopped to the point where they are no longer the right color or the official photos were taken of a prototype. I did think it was a monitor issue at first as well, but I checked on my other computer and phone and she still looks more blue/white than the very purple-purple girl I got.<br /><br />I do have to agree with the reviewer who said she needs something under that short-short skirt. She wouldn't be able to go up stairs or bend over without flashing the world if she were real.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD a few weeks ago and was instantly addicted. There were enough levels with increasing difficulty that it took me awhile to beat. I've since been searching for a game just like it (no luck so far). Maybe the developers will make a part 2? I'd gladly buy it!
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Awesome series. It literally had everything. Easily one of the best sci-fi dramas ever made. Great story lines and an absolute perfect cast.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|To see this show. Takes me back a few years - some of these scenes I have lived - some I've watched happen.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This Book is very touching in a lot of ways, and could teach us how to act in lots of different situations. Thank you, Palacio!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I like how you can curl hair and straighten it but there aren't many colors to change the hair spray like for the iPod overall I like the app
0765325950|2.0|After 14 books, the ending seemed to me, rushed and inadequate. A book of battles and endless enemies being thrust as obstacles was boring. There were many relationships and characters only mentioned in passing and not part of the story line. I felt probably two more books would have been needed to complete this epic series. Too many loose ends cut short to finish. This book makes me doubtful I want to reread the series again. Disappointing.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|I know this has been a high rated movie but for me it was depressing and i spent most of the movie wondering whrn it was going to be over. It was neither truthful or believable when it comes to mental illness. The reality of it is much worse. Gave it to my daughter who loves it.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|6677gitd i have a message for u nobody will want to get your games if you don't make them free no locked items its like $9.99 in all. This game is fun till  you have to buy fun items my 8 year old sister she played this and said i thought it was free why can't I do the boy??  Like if you agree so every can see( for some fun try my singing monsters)
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Can't wait for the next one but the plots are becoming very similar. Archer is a great story teller though.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I shouldn't have been surprised that this book would be terrible when you consider how much the last few books fell flat. I had hoped she would pick it up and give her loyal readers an ending we deserved. The lack of main characters we all loved was the worst part. The book was filled with day to day details that we didn't need and it felt like she didn't even attempt to write a good book.
B000FC12YQ|2.0|A friend recommended this one to me as a good example of the classic cozy mystery, but I must say that I was very dissatisfied.  The writing was reasonable, though the style was quite dated.  So, I can't fault the book on its technical merits.  However, it did not play fair, and that angers me.<br /><br />I don't want to say much specifically since that would be a spoiler, but I will say this: certain facts were deliberately misrepresented to the reader.  And when the investigator comes into possession of the true version of those facts, those are not shared with the reader until the final unmasking of the villain.  Thus, I feel I was lied to and then expected to congratulate the author when she revealed to me that I had been duped.<br /><br />No thank you.  I would rather have just been flogged about the head with the book rather than be fooled in this way.  Had I not been reading it on my Kindle, I would have literally flung it across the room.

0307702103|5.0|My wife and I enjoy driving, but sometimes listening to a good book makes the time fly by. For a recent trip, we picked John Grisham's Ford County. A nice feature of short stories is that there is a better chance you will reach the end of one before the day's trip ends. With a novel, you may have to wait until the next day to hear the rest.<br /><br />What intrigued me about Ford County was that the stories were read by the author himself. He's not an actor. It was just a man telling a story. But, because he wrote the stories, I had the feeling, he knew exactly what to emphasize.<br /><br />I loved all the stories, but my wife felt a couple of them were too negative for her taste. Another nice thing about a book of short stories is that you can skip the ones you don't think you'll like.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter,  husband and I have enjoyed this multiple  level game app. Each puzzle of each level has a move counter so one can try again to get the par for that puzzle; when par is reached a star appears in the upper right hand corner. Once a level is completed it offers to move to the next level. I appreciate the none emotional aspect of this game. It is something we've enjoyed doing as a family. Check out...you might enjoy.

0767817478|4.0|This movie was trashed by reviewers.  Even though it was very successful at the box office, plans for a sequel were scrapped.<br /><br />I don't know why.<br /><br />I thought Godzilla, starring Matthew Broderick, was a fun film.  I saw it originally in the theater when it was released.  I bought the VHS when it came out and I just recently bought the DVD from Amazon to watch with my 7 year old.  I still enjoy it.  I still can't understand why it was so savaged by reviewers.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The quality is good, it's a lot of fun, one of the best toy to kill time, if you have enough patience! But the structure is not strong for young kid to throw around.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|To much sex in this book, that it becomes redundant.  The story is okay.  I have to say that the last book was the best, if you could call it that.  I thought the book read like a cheap dime store romance, with a bunch of sex in it.  Really, what is the world coming to these days.  I'm disappointed in myself for reading it!
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|This is a very solid metal album.  Great production & musicianship, stellar vocals and excellent songs.  The lighter slower & mid-tempo songs, of which there are not a lot, are reminiscent of what I would have expected after Empire.  The heavier stuff is something that might have come out after The Warning, but with a little cleaner edge to it.  All in all, VERY WORTHY of release and significantly better than a lot of the material that's been released over the last 10 years, except for maybe Mindcrime 2.  Only two somewhat negatives, if you can call it that; First, the voice sounds a little too close to Geoff Tate.  I've heard the new guy sing outside of Queensryche and I think he's a good fit without trying to sound like Tate.  Second, there aren't enough songs (it shows 11, but two of them are intros) and most of them are too short.  Like most of you, I'm used to hour-plus albums from these guys.  In short, buy it.
B009K72G8I|5.0|This is the satisfying conclusion to the Younglings story arc, and the episode with the most action in this arc. Ahsoka and the 6 Younglings are trying to escape from Hondo's gang of pirates, when Grievous attacks the planet. No one is going to make it out if the Jedi and the pirates don't make an unlikely alliance.<br />  It is not really a stand-alone story,so you should see the 3 previous episodes first. I reccomend it if you like Grievous duels, Hondo and his pirates, or Kituni, Gungi, Zat, Byph, Petro and Ganodi.<br />  (Mild Spoilers) This story is great if you like young Jedi. Its exciting to watch them go into battle with their new lightsabers for the first time and at such a young age. Also, Ahsoka has to duel Grievous. Its not as dark or sad as some of the other episodes either. There are moments of emotion and humor too. There is not a whole lot of violance, except some of the pirates get killed, so it is appropriate for most children.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|My kids love this game, I could care less about it. It is easy enough for my 5 year old and still entertains my 10 year old.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Wonderful movie!<br />I'll always be a huge fan of the play, but this was a good edition.<br /><br />Samantha Barks, Eponine, was by far the best actress in the movie and the best choice for that character. &#60;3

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|This movie is not watered down, you have to be ready to watch this one!

It is a Incredible movie, and I am happy I got it.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|The first album out of the gate for Queensryche with their new singer does not disappoint - 'Queensryche' is the return to form that fans had been hoping and wishing for. This album contains some of the most solid and well-written work from the core founding members Michael Wilton, Ed Jackson and Scott Rockenfield, and their newest members Parker Lundgren and Todd LaTorre, their powerhouse new singer.<br /><br />Todd was put in a tough spot, fronting a band and replacing a legendary front man. It is a situation where if you sound too much like the former, you are called a copycat, a karaoke singer. If you sound too different, the band loses its identity because the music never sounds quite right. Todd was influenced by, among others, Geoff Tate, so naturally he sings in a similar manner, and this helps when he is performing classic tracks live, because there are moments the band sounds exactly like they did back in the day. With the new songs, you finally hear Todd sing his own way, his own style, and while you know you are listening to someone new, there are many moments where how he sings is just very familiar, without sounding like he is trying to copy. Todd works and works well to take QR on this second leg of their career.<br /><br />The album was written by all 5 members...no outside songwriters or session musicians like their previous 4 releases (OM2, American Soldier, Take Cover and Dedicated to Chaos), so instantly there is a reconnection on the musical level to what this band did back in the day. Sonically, you couldn't ask for a better recipe for success: Jim Barton, engineer/producer, who worked on the original Operation Mindcrime, Empire and Promised Land, is back working with the band to tie the band today back to the band they were, the sound they had. The album was recorded in part at London Studios, where QR worked on those earlier recordings. Gear from their early days (guitars, amps, etc) were brought out and used...so it wasn't a matter of tryingto recreate sounds, they were just able to create those sounds again. So 3 parts veteran, you still have two members with their new ideas, new approaches...how does that work?<br /><br />Listen to the first song on the album, 'Where Dreams Go to Die' (intro'd by X2, a track by Scott R)...song was written by Parker Lundgren. This first track is by far the most Queensryche-sounding track to come from this band in a decade, and it perfectly sets up what you are about to experience. All the things that you loved about this band...the complex lyrics, double guitars, the progressive elements...they are all back. Not in some way that is forced nostalgia, but just elements, nuances, nods to a musical idea, a lyrical phrase, a guitar lick played in a similar way. For those that don't know, when Parker was originally asked to play with Queensryche, when the requirement was to learn a few songs, he learned whole albums. If you see this guy on stage with the band, you will instantly pick up why he has earned his spot. How he and Whip play together and interact on stage is how it used to be with Chris on guitar.<br /><br />'Spore'...a progressive rocker with some amazing vocal acrobatics from Todd, this is what modern Queensryche should sound like. Some impressive drumming from Rock, this is stuff that to me sounds like it could have come from Promised Land.<br /><br />'In This Light'...as far as I am concerned, this is as near perfect a Queensryche song as there ever was...the guitar playing is right from Empire, the chorus will stick in your head, the dual guitar harmonies are back with a vengeance, and the build up/ending of this song is just epic.<br /><br />'Redemption', the first single, a straight ahead rocker with nods to Mindcrime and Empire. The song sounds even better on CD than it did on the lower quality YouTube teasers. What you don't get from those teasers is that it goes straight into 'Vindication', which you could drop onto Mindcrime and it would probably fit in without issue. There are moments musically and vocally this sounds exactly like the band did back in that era, then the chorus kicks and in and Todd earns his keep. Octave harmony vocals, and a chorus that just begs to sing along with...this is the song that also gets you driving fast if you are listening to it in your car.<br /><br />'Midnight Lullaby' is the into to 'A World Without', a song about a wife who dies during childbirth. 'ML' is haunting with sound effects and some eery music that tries to paint the story of this song with sounds. The guitar riff is a dark, haunting riff, instantly identifiable as QR, but completely new to my ear, like nothing I have heard from them before. This sounds similar to Empire/Promised Land material, but is darker and more complex than those songs. But the chorus is killer, and Todd's vocal on this song at times sounds exactly like the Queensryche you remember. The best part of this song is the appearance/return of Pamela Moore (Sister Mary from OM and OM2), and she adds this other level vocally to the song, a sort of call and response that works very well. It is not a gimmick, rather her participation was a surprise, as nothing had been mentioned online by the band or Pamela about her part on this record. I heard a female voice, hoped it was her on the record, and was happy to find out she was who I was listening to.<br /><br />'Don't Look Back' and 'Fallout' are straight ahead rockers that could fit well within their Rage-Empire era, again with some impressive vocals by Todd, who at times is doing things you never heard on a QR album before, but then is singing in such a way to cause you to think about half a dozen classic QR songs that sounds familiar. Ed's bass tone is brutal on these songs (in a good way).<br /><br />'Open Road' is a slower, darker epic song, well fitted to end this record. Some have likened it to Silent Lucidity, I think it sounds a bit more complex, and again it has all the elements of a QR song thatone would expect.<br /><br />Now the length on this album is 35 minutes. I read somewhere that originally the band wanted to do just an EP to get something out, and things got bigger. So what we have is a short album. My only complaint is that I wish I had more, but with the exception of one song, I never listened to this record and think it was too short. Every song says what it needs to say in the time it was given, and it all sounds appropriate. 'In This Light'...I love the ending, and I wish it was more drawn out with an extended fade out instead of the neat wrap up it currently has...that really is my only complaint. If anything there is a little bit of this album sounding safe, as if they didn't want to stray too far from that sound from their biggest era, because they wanted to ensure that the album exceeded expectations. And it does. Most often, you get these 'return to form' albums where you hear one song, like it, then you get the album and it has a bunch of songs that are neither way good or bad...they are unforgettable or they just miss the mark. This album, every song works, every song has a hook, every song sounds like Queensryche, so 35 minutes of solid songwriting and playing to me is far better than an hour of hits and misses. Besides, they are already working on material for the follow up, and from what has been reported, Jim Barton is on board for round 2.<br /><br />The live tracks...three live tracks on the Deluxe US edition...you get 'Queen of the Reich', 'En Force' and 'The Prophecy', recorded at a show in WA, but mixed as well by Jim Barton. The result are three live tracks that sonically align with the new studio tracks. What you hear in the performance is why Todd is the right singer for this band, because he nails these live tracks. You hear the energy, you hear this band on fire with their playing. You hear a band hungry again to do what made them great in the first place. I bought the Deluxe edition for these tracks (have not heard the Japanese only live track, 'I Don't Believe in Love') and it helps to round out the album to a longer length.<br /><br />This is a 4.5 out of 5 album for me, but I rated this 5 stars because there is no half rating system here, and because I am sure there are some out there who without giving this album a fair listen, or who blindly support Geoff and his version of Queensryche, will no doubt 1-star review this release just to get the numbers down. I did do a review of Geoff's QR release (FU), and gave it a 1-star review, but I did listen to all tracks and tried to be as objective as possible. The issue I have with Geoff's release, it is not Queensryche. I know it isn't the original band, but if you are one to acknowledge Geoff's new version of the band, that album is still not Queensryche, because it was written by at least four different groups of people, was recorded by over 2 dozen musicians, many of them session players or guest musicians...so the involvement of his actual Queensryche was minimal, and at no point does his touring band, the band he calls Queensryche, ever play as a band on that album. Had they, my review would have reflected that. There are four re-records on his album, the music (all playing) was done by one unknown session musician, with no ties to the band, no history to Geoff, and yet those four songs were sliced off and presented as a digital EP under the Queensryche name. People should know what they are paying for, if they see a band on a website and an album for sale, the assumption is that the band did the album work, and with Geoff's QR, this isn't the case. It is not an honest record. Songs were written by others, in some cases, the songs existed as finished tracks by other bands, reworked into songs for Geoff (same thing happened on American Soldier and DTC). QR...the real QR...there may be things on this record I would have loved to hear more of, but at least those 5 guys I have seen and support live are the ones behind this record.<br/><br />When you take on a new singer, it can go good, bad or different. Some find a sound alike and thrive, some find a new voice and also thrive, some can never compete against their former legacy and singer. QR with Todd singing is not a sound alike, but he sings in a similar manner. He is different, he brings a lot as a vocalist and musician to the table. But most important, he allows the rest of the band to be Queensryche again, and the album they were able to make after years of oppression and settling is finally here, the album the fans have hoped and waited for.<br /><br />So if you are a casual fan, I think you will really enjoy this. If all the drama is news and you are unsure, find the streams, listen to the clips, and keep an open mind, because while some things sound different with them now, as a whole this sounds like what you expect Queensryche in 2013 to sound like. Geoff will always sound like Geoff, but if it was solely about the voice, then his solo records would sound like Queensryche, and they don't...if it was just about Geoff, FU would sound like Queensryche and it does not either.<br /><br />For the more rabid QR fans...you probably have this already, or are on the fence...buy this record, you will not be disappointed.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is my only means of really connecting with friends and family that are close and far away.  Sometimes I would like it if Facebook would be a little more personal with their account holders...like having someone to actually talk to when a problem arises instead of checking yes or no when a question pops up and ask if our problem was solved...when it actually wasn't.  I just learned to just click yes or no and keep it moving...but it would be more productive if there was a live person you can communicate your concerns to just to let them know what the problem actually is...because that is why some accounts get blocked because of no on to voice the actual problem or concern to.  But I love Facebook...it just need some personal interaction with their account holders...that's all...!

B001OMJGD0|3.0|Technically it was good, sfx were excellent.  Routh's portrayal was a strong reminder of Chris Reeve's in the original series.  I would like to have seen more interaction between Lois and Superman.  I continue to be amazed at Kevin Spacey's ability to play psychopath killers with such believability.  He is a superior actor.<br /><br />The religious undertones to this story line were jaw dropping.  The good man goes away for awhile and returns with a clearer understanding of his place and mission in the world.  In order to stop evil from destroying the world, he risks everything, is beaten, stabbed in the side and flatlines in the hospital, only to be returned to life after a visit from the woman who loves him, Lois.  He departs from the top of the newspaper building by flying upward and promising to always be around.  If you can't figure out who this references, you are truly uninformed.

B000B3MIZG|1.0|I bought this dvd for a gift and it was defective!  I have a learned a lot from this experience.  Used cd's and dvd's are not the way to go.  Unlike books, which can be used in most used conditions, discs present another problem.  They do not necessarily show the defects visually.  Yes, they can be returned, but it becomes a hassle; contacting the company, waiting for a response, printing out the instructions and labels, and then a trip to the mailing source.  I will not do this again!

B000VECAEO|5.0|This was the final season of ,perhaps,the greatest sitcom of all time.Even though writer Larry David was gone the<br />Scripts became stranger and lacked that certain something,they will still fall into the classic category with the other<br />Crazy episodes. I've never been as saddened by a series end as I was with Seinfeld.I was never as on-time as those<br />Thursday nights on must-see-tv. If you've never tried this show,treat yourself to this timeless classic.But maybe start<br />With season 3 and save this season 9 for last (or keep season 1/2 for last,these are the tuning-up episodes,not really<br />Up to par with later shows).

Not campy like the 60s tv show, although I loved that show also, and not like the new ones full of flash and bang.  Modern movies feel the need to outdo each other in violence and flashy effects much to the detriment of everything else.  While the new movies are not bad at all they also fall into the trap.  This movie is all about style and atmosphere.  It's just the ultimate batman, I'm going to go watch it now.

0385349831|4.0|In 1954 two men found some papyruses in a cave in Egypt. Though they were not allowed to leave the country, one of them was, as there were 155 copies of it. I was written as late as the year 1307 and in a city near Egypt named Accra. This book is a translation of that manuscript.<br /><br />The book consists of a wise man answering villagers' questions. He discusses topics such as the value of having been defeated, beauty, following your heart, living every day as if it were your first, sex, war, elegance, work, success, anxiety, the future, loyalty, enemies, and more.<br /><br />Some great quotes from the book include the following:<br />\\"In the cycle of nature there is no such things as victory or defeat; there is only movement.\\"<br /><br />\\"For those who feel oppressed by solitude, it's important to remember that in life's most significant moments we are always alone.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't try to be useful. Try to be yourself; that is enough, and that makes all the difference.\\"<br /><br />\\"And to those who believe that adventures are dangerous, I say, try routine; that kills you far more quickly.\\"<br /><br />\\"The most terrible of all weapons is the word, which can ruin a life without leaving a trace of blood, and whose wounds never heal.\\"<br /><br />The book is a very quick and easy read.

B00371QQ0M|5.0|I got into Dune in reverse. It started out with the PC game, then the movie, and then finally the book. I really enjoy the rich storytelling and the movie really did a commendable job at interpreting Frank Herbert's epic space fantasy tale.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is pretty clean and the audio is great. There are grainy textures in some scenes but I love it because it transports me to the time when the movie was released.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray version is definitely worth the purchaseif you enjoyed the VHS classic and want to get a decent upgrade.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Thanks Mark for writhing this.  I appreciate it man.  What an awesome book from an awesome dude.  I learned so much about business, investing, managment, and hard work.  I appreciate the wisdom and I can't wait for the next book.  I only bought a Kindle because I couldn't find this book in hard copy.  So really, I spent over 65$ or so for the book, but it was well worth it.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Léon is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time. The story is captivating and a little awkward, seeing as it is between a grown man and 14 year old girl.<br /><br />Luc Besson created a story that is delivers action and memorable characters. Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman deliver stunning performances. Natalie Portman's first major role is a definite must-see. Each time I watch this movie I dream of a sequel to see what happens to Mathilda.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version definitely delivered a quality viewing, with great audio and crisp visuals. I am no expert on these matters, but for the general movie viewer this is a great version.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This App has a bunch of different sounds and music genres to help you relax and drift off somewhere peaceful!  Love it especially the rainy day ones!  Thanks.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|lots of fun! there was a little bit of a. learning curve at first but after you figure out some things out it goes pretty smoothly.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Absolutely wonderful return to form. Absolutely impressed. I purchased the Geoff Tate thinking two Queensryches were better than one. I was very disappointed in Tate's hired mercenary album. This album belongs up there with Rage for Order and Mindcrime.
B000FC1192|5.0|Well writen, this book will be passed on to many more button lovers in the world.  Reader Beware. Ha Ha Haaah.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|Just receive a new 3-d led, and I jump for joy at the movie, great plot great ending, one of the best
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game is very challenging and I love it!! It's not just a clone of 100 floors, itself s actually a very different and more fun game to play
B00005JPCF|5.0|I have not watched it gave it as a gift to my sister and family they enjoyed watching in french and english was delivered ahead of schedule they watched again in french
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|As a long-time fan of Queensryche, I always found a number of gems on each album, even after the Promised Land era; but the consistency of each body of work started waning after Chris DeGarmo's departure. With the band's decision in 2012 to dismiss Geoff Tate as frontman and the subsequent hiring of Todd LaTorre to take the mic, I was curious to say the least. With this release, there is no doubt left in my mind who the weak link was in the group for the past number of years.<br /><br />The songs are fresh, enthusiastic, polished and \\"interesting\\" to listen to once again. Lyrically, the guys have again embraced the idea that their fans are actually intelligent. Deciding to hire James \\"Jimbo\\" Barton again for this album's production shows the band's commitment to success. Everything is \\"just right\\" again.<br /><br />LaTorre's vocals are fantastic. Rockenfield and Jackson have more power and presence than they have in recent memory. Wilton and Lundgren bring back haunting melodies and searing dueling guitars Queensryche is famous for.<br /><br />In short, the REAL Queensryche has stood up, and I couldn't be happier about it.<br /><br />Highlights on the album for me include:<br />-Where Dreams Go To Die<br />-Spore<br />-In This Light<br />-A World Without<br />-Fallout<br />-Open Road<br /><br />I strongly recommend this album.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I just love the premise of this movie and I love the chemistry between these actors! Its an easy feel good move to watch when you want to laugh and relax.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Brought this for my granddaughter for Christmas last year. She like it that it had enough space for a lot of her new dolls.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|NO EASY DAY will still be read in the 22nd century. Owen who still may be prosecuted for writing this account of his part in Seal Team Six's capture and execution of the odious Osama bin Laden courageously decided to preserve the historic event at high risk to his career; however, I believe future generations will be grateful to have this detailed eyewitness evidence of one of the most daring military missions in U. S. history in their libraries, whether physically on a shelf or stored electronically. Like the mission itself, NO EASY DAY is a quick, thrilling read.<br />Victor L Mote aka v traven<br />ret. Capt.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|I saw this movie once and remembered how beautiful the setting was for this movie.  It`s just a little long to watch very often but maybe again in a few years.
B00BP3DPJY|4.0|Saw them on Leno and bought the entire album since it was on special. I like the Song for Zula best but the others I'm sure will grow on me as I listen to them. They have a unique sound and I like that they use many different instruments. Listen to the samples...if you like it, buy it!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|There are a ton of great in-depth reviews here, so I won't bore you with another. Suffice to say, as a fan since the EP was released this is BY FAR the best thing they've done in over 15 years.<br /><br />The musicianship is stellar, Scott's drumming alone is worth the price of the CD, Ed Jackson sounds great, it's nice to see Parker contribute and of course Wilton is his usual amazing self.<br /><br />What puts this album over the top is Todd La Torre. His vocal range and the emotion he sings with remind me of the good old Queensyche days, but with a twist because he actually sounds like a mixture of Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Ray Alder and Geoff Tate. Four of my favorite singers.<br /><br />Listening everyday my favorite songs change all the time, right now I like:<br /><br />Vindication, In This Light, Don't Look Back and Open Road.<br /><br />If you loved Queensryche's classic albums from the 80's and 90's, I highly recommend this, you won't be disappointed.
1781162646|5.0|Arrived very fast in great condition. Can't wait to finish my current book, so I can get started on this book.  gotta love Stephen King.
B004GYY714|5.0|i love tune in radio I choose my music type and categories and I can listen all day if I want too! awesome . And it was easy to download thanks Amazon you guys are great !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this os a great gaming app for when u are bored. best time to buy games is when they go half off. rack up points than when it happens buy buy buy!! for a free app it is pretty awesome
0893860220|5.0|This book is in question and answer form in particular from those from western cultures. Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is indeed a man who has reached his pinnacle as an enlightened being and in doing so is totally free.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I see several bad reviews. So far my only complaint is that it doesn't always save my puzzle so if I can't finish at one time I have to start over. Also it would be nice to set the default number of pieces at maximum.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a super series for any political junkies like me and for others who want to get a feel of things behind the scenes in the White House.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Glad I purchased it, but had to do so TWICE cuz it wouldn't download. It would have been better if I only had to purchase once
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I was so happy to find this book. My Aunt was a huge Wizard of Oz fan and so my early memories are of pretending we were skipping along down the yellow brick road and playing out the characters. Hope you get a chance to read the book.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|watching this show for a long time I just love this show in television. very interesting and very good acting
1451613512|4.0|Overall, this is an excellent overview of the last 115 years of the American empire. There is a wealth of information here, especially for newcomers to the subject. My only complaint is that, like Howard Zinn's classic book, it doesn't go far enough into the area of Deep Politics, to use Peter Dale Scott's phrase. I understand it probably would have required another 700 pages.<br /><br />The JFK assassination is dealt with in less than one page, basically saying that unknown powerful forces were probably at work. There is no discussion of the assassinations of RFK, MLK and Malcolm X. The emphasis is mostly on foreign policy, but even here there are gaps. There is no mention of the U-2 crisis in 1960 (an important event in destroying Eisenhower's peace summit with Khrushchev), or the USS Liberty attack. I don't recall any mention of Operation Northwoods or MK-ULTRA. Official stories are accepted where they should be questioned more (Pearl Harbor, James Forrestal's death). 9/11 is discussed from the position of Chalmers Johnson's \\"Blowback.\\"<br /><br />The chapters covering the period 1974 to the present are effective, savage indictments of the string of weak puppet leaders who have led the empire for the last 40 years, following the paranoia and madness of Nixon and LBJ. Looming behind them all, though, are the institutions of the unelected national security state that have grown like a cancer throughout our lives.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A great remake of the original. Actors are great Visual effects are great. Different story line and costume than original
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Yes, it's convoluted & confusing...but this is my kind of movie. It was intriguing enough to keep me interested and the pacing made it possible to put this puzzle together...eventually. The visual impact of each of the eras felt authentic and I believed these characters existed in their time periods. If you liked &#34;Inception&#34; or movies like it, then you will probably like this movie. I can't wait to read the book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The very best in acting, story, and photography. Well worth your time.<br />I rarely watch TV shows but this series is exceptional.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Richard Thompson has a stellar recording catalogue dating back to 1969 with Fairport Convention. He is one of the best guitarists to grace the planet and is also a songwriter from the top shelf.<br /><br />Many artists of his generation sound tired and jaded but not Richard. Electric is chock full of great songs and his guitar is front and centre for all to admire. Life doesn't get much better than this
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The very best in acting, story, and photography. Well worth your time.<br />I rarely watch TV shows but this series is exceptional.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I did not like it. it drags and drags, and then it's painful... spend your time and money elsewhere, you'll thank me.
B00AEFYKWU|5.0|Great movie, very happy I bought this product. Nice to have just to put on when there is nothing to watch on tv.
1439102813|5.0|What a wonderful book to follow along someone who gets alzheimers. The book was very well written! I didn't want to put it down!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Been a fan since the beginning. Read them all. The later ones are less than the earlier ones. They are co-written with other thriller writers, to the detriment of the series. I'm pretty sure all that Tom Clancy wrote was his name on the cover. All in all, a pretty ok read. Just not the clever techno thriller of past.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I couldn't put my Kindle down, puzzle after puzzle it got better as it went on. Great story line, fun game play, I recommend it! :o
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love this show and can download it when I want.<br />Thanks to my Prime membership.<br />Cable wants me to pay more money to watch the show.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game so much I got their other two games!! I think that they should bring out an app that tells you how to escape it would make it much easier. I just finished all of the levels about two minutes ago. Yay for me!!?
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like twitter because it's a fast and easy way to keep up on what is going on in the world. I don't listening to the news because I'm not a sports person and just want a quick view on what is going on in the world and Twitter does that for me.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This was a great book. I enjoyed reading it.There were lots of things that I didn't know until I read the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest...there are just so many ideas and &#34;how to's&#34; on there...I spend hours just looking at everything. And I like it because it's all kept online so you don't have to have papers laying around that get lost when you want to know how to do something.  I've used it for craft ideas, food recipes, style ideas, and home design.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|Continues on in the tradition of Thin Lizzy and great Irish Rock and Roll. You will find yourself hooked as soon as you start listening.
B00847KFDS|5.0|A very well crafted album that was a long time in the making . The collaborations work very well. Have you ever seen the rain , with Bob Seger , is very well done , swinging from Fogerty guitar style to Seger piano style , depending on who is doing the vocal .
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved the last Olympian because it had so much CLIFF hangers. I also loves that I couldn't stop reading it. This was my second time reading it and it's just as good. I <3 it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great... keeps the brain fresh and the clues are very good. I love the game, also my wife love it.
B00CFSWMYM|5.0|Austra's OLYMPIA is certainly different than their debut, FEEL IT BREAK, but a masterpiece none-the-less. Have a few listens before you make a final decision!
1490313370|1.0|The basic take-home message of Choose Yourself:<br /><br />1a. There are never enough lists. List everything.<br /><br />1b. You are royally screwed if you plan on banking on a traditional career path through corporate America.<br /><br />2. Right when you wake up read for two hours after counting all the things you are grateful for (probably the best advice in the book).<br /><br />3. Spend another two hours writing. *cough* ripping *cough* off *cough* \\"The Artist's Way\\" *cough*<br /><br />(It is now 9:00 AM if you wake at 5:00 AM, just keep track)<br /><br />4. Write a list of 10 new ideas to exercise your \\"idea muscle\\". They can be logical or complete nonsense. I'm not making this up. James gives some outrageous examples. Even Bill Gates couldn't capitalize on them like sending an array of solar panels into space to power the world. Have fun pitching that!<br /><br />5. Somehow get to work on time because, even though corporate America is screwing you over, you want to make your bosses look good.<br /><br />6. Go above and beyond your duties at work including researching everything about the company going back to its inception. Hope you don't work for Coca-cola or GM! Always do more. Just enough isn't enough. You once again have to make your bosses, who BTW are trying to screw you over, look good.<br /><br />7. Now after going beyond the call and hopefully out-performing your competition don't try to negotiate a raise because negotiating is useless.<br /><br />8. Spend your afternoon/night or whatever working on your own business which originated from exercising your \\"idea muscle\\".<br /><br />9. Go on a 5 minute walk to stay healthy (rolls eyes).<br /><br />10. Don't each junk food (how original).<br /><br />11. Spend time with all your loved ones (also original).<br /><br />12. Don't watch TV unless you work for a TV company and you are doing \\"company research\\".<br /><br />13. Get in your time machine (also a product of your \\"idea muscle\\") and travel back a fewhours so you can actually get adequate sleep (7 - 9 hours).<br /><br />14. Also never purchase any real estate or cars. Rent all your rooms on day to day basis (your family will love this). Rely on zipcar.<br /><br />15. Get a galaxy note because you don't need a computer.<br /><br />Choose yourself is a mish mash of blog inspired ideas. And like a blog it doesn't consider it's composition as a whole and is instead formulated piece meal without any thought to how each post relates to the other. I would truly give James a pass on this if he actually gave examples of people he helped using these ideas (he does offer workshops so surely there's someone). Instead we get tons of \\"I knew this guy\\" and \\"this one person I helped\\" or \\"this big shot i talked to\\". It's no wonder he uses fibber extraordinaire Tucker Max as validation. He cherry picks his other examples like Sara Blake and Richard Branson. He helped neither. There is some poor humor involved using the most banal forms or irony (if you're into that sort of thing). No howlers here. IMO it's horrible taste to mix self-help with irony because it sends a mixed message to the reader.<br /><br />There are some tidbits worth a read. Mainly from the first 20% of the Kindle Edition. Like this quote:<br /><br />\\"The learned man aims for more. But the wise man decreases. And then decreases again.\\"<br /><br />Too bad James doesn't follow this advice.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I watched this with my kids and; although, there were a few instances of profanity that I did not like and one scene of the lead female dressed only in her underwear from behind , the movie as a whole was okay. It's billed as a &#34;Comedy Horror&#34; and that's what it delivered. It made us laugh. It made us jump. It made us cringe. Just don't expect too much from the storyline, but seriously, who would?
B002LU0E26|3.0|The movie is okay. The story could have been less cheesy. Overall, I feel it makes a good spinoff of Superman 2.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|In very short words all I can say is fun and awesome to play. Challenging yet simple all in one.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|If you enjoy the movies you will enjoy this series without a doubt.  The story, plot and character development and acting are all amazing.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|Awesome. Very creative and current. There is nothing better than to hear old favorites done in a new way that is done professionally and with passion.
B002A5WQ8W|4.0|This has to be Dave Brubeck's Quartet's best album. Take Five one of Jazz's premium songs, Get it it's great.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal Season 1<br /><br />Im really in to this show. I love the way they name the episodes after gourmet dishes. Good writing, great actors.
193700788X|1.0|I have read every book from the series start as well as the off shoots and have to say this was such an overall disappointment. Its like she didn't want to write the series anymore so she rushed to try and close it out, I guess maybe the HBO series pays better. Sookie went from a burgeoning young woman finding her own in love and life to a shallow, used up door mat. I won't put any spoilers in here but my advice is to save it until you have nothing else to read, then borrow a friends copy or check it out of the library; don't waste your money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, I enjoy it so much, and if your in love with horses, you should get it.
1401900526|5.0|These cards are first class!!!!<br /><br />The artwork is beautiful, simple and elegant, and the words really resonate with you. You can tell that Louise Hay takes great pride in her work and helping others.<br /><br />There are so many cards, it may be better to split them up. Keep some cards near your bed so you read them before you start the day and before you go to sleep. You may also needs to keep other cards handy at the office where you need to encourage yourself to be creative and remind yourself that co-workers are fellow human beings who are doing their best in life. Your intuition will tell you which cards to read when.<br /><br />I'm very happy I purchased these.<br /><br />EDIT: Already I noticed several positive changes just by reading these cards and TAKING THEM TO HEART these past few days. When you read the words, they must resonate with you.<br /><br />To those of you who don't believe this, I can attest that Law of Attraction works. There were dark times in life where I have seen Law of Attraction work in opposite direction, and then when I was at my very darkest, I started to learn how our Thoughts and Words shape our destiny.<br /><br />Einstein said that insanity is \\"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\\". To the people who are skeptical (and really, I don't blame you), please try this. You don't have to spend any money - as soon as you catch yourself having a negative thought, quickly change it to something more positive - and learn to forgive yourselves.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app truly. Yea it won't be like taking care of a live horse but it kinda go especially them an idea. I have two beautiful horses. One is named champ she is my world. I go through a lot. Even thought about suicide. But she kept my head<br /> up. So if you get this app it's a start if you want a horse.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett is a master storyteller.  Don't hesitate to read this book and the one before it - Pillars of the Earth.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It's heavy content was really interesting, especially from the point of view of a mother. Being a mother of a son I found this eye opening and amazed to read some of her experiences and feelings.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Too many &#34;f&#34; bombs, too much unnecessary violence and gore, lousy costumes and make-up for the witches and a plot that did not make sense but was predictable, just the same. There was no effort to &#34;act&#34; on the part of the characters which was disappointing because that little bit of  effort could have made the difference for the viewers. I quit watching after 25 minutes and deleted the movie from my Kindle.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A slightly strange and funny book with a god story line and some very engaging characters. Definitely Worth the read.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Felt is a great way to access my favorite need sites as well as get a broad review of world, national, entertainment, health news, sports, really anything I need.  It's easy to use, user friendly, and works beautifully on my Fire.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is my favourite read in a long while. I didn't have any expectations but this book was funny and light hearted while keeping a good story line. An easy and highly entertaining read!
098478280X|5.0|Really solid tips and practice for the new graduate or the recently laid off! The first ~200 pages really help on soft skills, like general interviewing tips, what to expect in the interview, and resume best practices. Seriously, the resume tips are REALLY good.<br /><br />Otherwise, like the author says, this isn't a book to learn your basic data structures for the first time, but a great guide to learn how to work with the structures in an interview environment.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read with good character development and an interesting plot. Well worth reading!
B00942G4UA|5.0|I liked this documentary as it showed how food is processed.  I want to visit farmers markets as I can.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Much of the time, I found Evernote to have some helpful aspects, but the main downside to it is such a major drawback that I will never use it again (particularly in light of how easy it would have been to address this problem and how long they could have been aware of it). I mainly used Evernote as a method of keeping a journal of my experience with my kids, but it has a terrible system of highlighting text that led to some very upsetting experiences. In trying to move around in the text, it was very inaccurate in what it would highlight incorrect things. But even worse, it would then compound the issue by being overly sensitive in offering to paste in new information. On three separate occasions, it pasted in text I had copied from an email, completely erasing the text I had written about my kids. The worst part of all is that Evernote somehow doesn't think -- like any other program I've ever encountered -- that you may want to UNDO something. There is no option to do so. I don't understand this lack of functionality that is befitting for a computer from 1983. I lost well over two weeks of my journal tonight and it is the last straw. I'd rather write it down on a piece of paper than deal with technology so prone to screwing things up unnecessarily and then providing no method for retrieval. The automatic save function is actually awful at such times, as it saves any change you make even if you wish you could revert to an earlier form. This is a pathetic program.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The app works great, but the maps aren't that big. Other than that it's a terrific app, also it needs a update
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey because of all the buzz about it but I really didn't think it would be my kind of program.  I was very wrong.  The show, although based in the early 1900's, has all the intrigue and problems of a modern day show.  It's got sex (but not graphic), murder, blackmail and back-stabbing and most are resolved happily.  Great show.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game peaked my interest and I'm glad I downloaded, easy to get into, levels aren't too difficult, I think it's great brain exercise, yet to see my kids attempt this app but I think they'll enjoy as did I. Good on road trips.<br /><br />Great game!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great book. Nice to read a book like this written from the male perspective! Funny and romantic all at once.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome...I like to use my imagination. FUN on a car trip or to play waiting for my Mom at the doctor.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|It's Bruce Lee! - nothing more should need to be said about the best martial artist of all time - plot is ok but it is the fight scenes that are amazing.
B003W77SA8|5.0|My purchase came just as promised, I think that says it all.  great music and great timing.  Thank you very much
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|What else needs to be said...It is Harry Potter, Blu-ray, and the only way to make it better is to include the movies in 3D!!
B00006RAKP|5.0|This two-CD set is loaded with great songs from Elton John.  It is full of my favorite hits that I love!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game great challenging would like to see more games like this. can't wait for the updates. a lot of fun.
B00005JKGK|3.0|This movie follows very little of the book and would be used well if you wanted to have students contrast director decisions or choose which they prefer.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is cool. It can pass the time with the different movements and my family loves to play it they have a blast with it.
1451662432|3.0|Pretty cool book if you like hearing all about how great he is. I would rate this book a 5 out of 10.
B00008G8M4|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago, but wanted my own copy.  Now that I have it, I can watch it whenever I want.<br /><br />Also, I am a Will Smith fan.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Great movie, good actors, good quality video, good audio quality. Really quite a fun movie appropriate for all ages. Family loved it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I do not approve of the content of this book and discarded it.  It is something I would not consider appropriate for Amazon to sell.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this. Could not stop. WIsh it were a full length novel. Sanderson is a great story teller.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|if I need a hint I don't know what to do.  seriously. in need of hint or helps.  I am quite stuck and don't know what to do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good app very fun addicting and challenging.... recommended highly...plus its free a must try for sure...try it out. Highly recommend! Go get it download it you wont be dissatisfied
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|do NOT get it. I would rather use the regular. browser it is extremely slow and the buttons confuse me.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Most who see this movie will want to seek further information on this historical event that was never fully investigated and no one has ever been tried and convicted of the killing of our president.  It proves that, as the boss of our government officials, we allowed this crime to be covered up and will continue to be until 2038 when the documents pertaining to it will become public knowledge.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent trilogy!  The best trilogy I've read in a long time. Loved the intrigue and mystery but especially the love story of Grey and Ana.
B00CQTKGY8|3.0|Some good info but was looking for a more detailed book on different ways to use the gopro. A bit one dimensional
B003VPC72K|5.0|great quality! exactly what you would expect from a vinyl LP album.<br /><br />If you have a turn table and like the deftones, go for it!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The only thing I might say is that it is a bit redundant and slightly too long.<br />Otherwise I like the scenery.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next the story is getting good.  The ogre speaks and people obey as they should. Till next time.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I liked the first person narration from a character who can only communicate with others by grunting. I don't usually like zombie movies but this one adds the love element, so I tried it out because I love supernatural romance. I even ended up tearing up a bit. It was lovely.
014241011X|3.0|The  condition of the book was claimed to be more polished than it actually was, with the cover as well as the pages themselves appearing old and well used.  Not a very accurate representation.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, looking forward to more levels. Not too hard, not too easy. Can be addicting! Now my kids want to play it also.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I have loved both Albums and the EP by the Fleet Foxes and am eagerly awaiting their 3rd album, which I believe is in production now. I was fortunately able to see the group live in San Diego and then in St. Malo, France, a couple of years ago, and they did not disappoint! Excellent live, and sounding wonderfully clear, their talent came through with the many different instruments they are capable of playing, and the wonderful vocals, headed up by Robin Pecknold. Both haunting at times and always melodic, their music is always in the back of my mind, and I never tire of it, enjoying it especially when I need calm! My favorite track is Bedhouin Dress, although all of Helplessness Blues is incredible! Thank you Fleet Foxes - can't wait for the next addition to your wonderful collection of music :-)
B008B1BL4E|5.0|This a massive undertaking given all the people involved and the various cultures and politics. Not for the begainer, history nut. As a long time member of the &#34;World War One Historical Association&#34;, I know it brings together alot of recent historical sources and puts them into a clear well presented format. History is a tough subject to write WELL and Mr. Clark does it VERY WELL.<br />GOOD JOB, GREAT BOOK!<br /><br />Stan Stanley

B006LXQID8|5.0|This movie is like creme brule&eacute; , you can't stop with just a bite.  Amelie is a simple girl, almost a recluse.  She takes pleasure in the simple things in life, but something is missing.  She is impossibly shy, unable or unwilling to form personal connections.  Until...one day her life changes forever.<br /><br />She decides to become \\"a regular do-gooder\\" after a certain event leads to a random discovery of an abandoned object.  She vows to return this precious box of childhood trinkets to the owner, a man now over 50.  She changes his life as he vows to see more of his apparently estranged family.  After this event she is overwhelmed to alter peoples lives for the better (with sometimes hilarious outcomes for those who are more deserving of wacky pranks).<br /><br />She continues her quest and in the process, discovers herself and (maybe) gets the handsome Nino Camcompoix.  Do they find each other?  Are they the significant other of the other?<br /><br />And the biggest mystery of all...WHO IS THE MAN IN THE RED SHOES?!?!?  Watch and find out.<br /><br />PS: The movie is in French with English subtitles.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Liked the character. Waitng to see what the rest of the series will be like. Peaked my interest enough to buy further books in the series.

B007BT0RKG|5.0|This gave us major intersections on the highway.  Saved so many very confusing situations.  We were able to enlarge the map to easily see what each interchange looked like.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think that this is a wonderful game, it can become quite addictive. It's fun to play and there are a lot of things to choose from. The main drawback for me is that when your adding neighbors the different steps you have to go through. There should only be 1 maybe 2 tops.I would tell anyone to at this game though because it's fun.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Another winner from Zen. The Avengers table is very clever, as each Avenger has their own ball that comes with certain bonuses.Great game. Well worth the 2 bucks.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love the mortal instrument. I can't wait for the movie to cone out. It's funny and it puts you at the edge of your seat. Each book uncover the unexpected. I would recommend this book for those who love vampires and werewolves. You cannot stop reading these book. The best series ever.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game...fun-filled and a faster pace than a lot of games.  I would recommend to anyone who likes bingo.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great game. the only down side is the opening ad before each game but its a minor annoyance.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well written, great and complicated plot. Great characters that you learn to love (or hate). A great read and not just for teenagers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not bad. my daughter and I found the tricky parts together.  if you leave and come back it keeps your progress by floor but you lose any work on that floor.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|I read this at the suggestion of a friend before traveling to Italy this summer.  Our visit to Pompeii was made so much more interesting because I'd read the book.  I looked for the narrow streets, the windowless street-facing walls, the elegant baths--and the brothels! All came to life because of the story woven with history in this charming book.  Bam
B0063GORYU|4.0|Can't stop playing. Easy to use and very adictive to play. And free too. Easy to download. A favorite game.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love this album and the blend of other performers including his sons.  I am amazed at how John can incorporate so many genres and it all smoothly comes together.  My only negative feeling is for Proud Mary.  It always aggravates me when shrill women sing this song,  This is a man's song!  I am somewhat prejudiced in favor of John  Fogerty's music since I own every album he ever released.  Not only is his music unique, it lifts my spirits with his honest, perceptive lyrics.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The movie's script was full of humerous sarcasm which was unexpected. I thought the sarcasm might end because that was a highlight for me. Not all movies are creatively sarcastic and this one is a pleasure. At times young love was frustrating to watch/hear (i.e. the rants, proclamations of love, etc., enough already!) but in all the movie is well worth the watch. It's funny, clever, heartfelt, and interesting.
0321701763|5.0|I ordered this book because I had the same book in an older version CS2, and I had upgraded to the newer CS5. Amazon listed it at less than half the price I could get it any where else. It was new unused and the enclosed training DVD had not been opened. Great value and good training.
B00425S1H8|5.0|works great on my us cutter laserpoint. got a new computer and had to get a new adapter. works with windows 8
0345529057|5.0|This is probably the best series of books I have ever read!  It's fantasy, yet the characters are so real you find yourself thinking about them as actual people.  HBO does a good job on the show, but to get the depth of the story you need to read the books.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app if you don't get it I understand $3 is a lot of money but I would definetly recommend it so please get it!!!!!!;)
0812973992|4.0|A beautifully written book that tells the tale of one day on which many lives entwined. In expertly weaving together several seemingly disjointed stories, it appeals to a wide audience, but particularly to those who want to feel the pulse of New York City in the '70s.
0762449306|5.0|I did not buy this product through Amazon, now I wish I had, it is cheaper here. It is an adorable little tardis, and is perfect for the Whovian under a budget. Would recommend for anyone who wants a tardis sitting on their bed stand. :)

030796664X|5.0|My friend heard a portion of this on CBC radio and then checked it out of the library.  She recommended it to me and after my husband and I both listened to it I thought it would make a good gift for my Dad for Father's Day.  He and my mom like to take long driving trips - something to listen to while they drive.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A true classic in my estimation.  I love literature that &#34;digs deep&#34; and is loaded with wisdom and purpose.  Like C.S. Lewis' &#34;Chronicles of Narnia&#34; the philosophy and world view of the author are beautifully framed in wonderful storytelling.
B009PAETCG|1.0|This was bought accidentally for a kid and after 10.99 it still isnt very fun. Note: Dont let your kids play the free version without setting it up for them. They switch modes and he ended up buying it. No way to delete and get money back.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This well precedes &#34;Psycho Cybernetics&#34; (Maxwell Maltz), which I have found to be profoundly influential in my life and thinking, but covers some of the same territory.  I consider this a classic and essential addition to the library and repertoire of anyone who desires to reach toward his full potential.

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|As an old QR fan since 1984, Tate is gone and QR put out the best album (and really only good one) since Empire.<br />Is this really shocking to any old school QR fan? I think not because Tate's direction of the band killed them to many old fans.Bottom line it will never be the 80's again, but this is as classic QR as you're ever going to get and it is really, really a great album. I did not listen to it for free I just went into the sotre and purchased it because I want to support the BAND and not some overrated egocentric singer who thinks he is the band (singer disease).<br /><br />Geoff Tate , you suck (just as much as that fraud Eddie Skunk Trunk) and thanks for killing QR for over a decade..Eddie, Scott and Michael have risen support them!!<br /><br />Only bad thing about this album is the title, is should have been called after their new tune VINDICATION!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|TOO much fun! Really makes you think!!! Didn't think it would really &quot;stamp&quot; me, but it does. Highly recommend this game!!
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This film is just narrowly misses the blockbuster caliber billing that it really should have had somehow, I can't put my finger on what it is that it is missing, however a nice flick for all those looking for a fresh twist on what you have been told as a child.This film has all the right ingredients to be a blockbuster horror movie but somehow is just flat of that luster.Good movie for home viewing though!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this game ..just ordered it day before yesterday & already through all the floors ...challenging but not frustrating ....ready for more floors!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Just as I am sitting down to be entertained by some weird side effects of sort ... this movie fools you with all sorts of details you would not have expected, it really is disappointing for those who try to summarize the movie by it's title and description. However it is a good home viewing movie to see at least once. I would make it my second or last choice though.
1250012570|5.0|I've heard nothing but good things about this book so of course I needed to pick it up, though I was a little wary about it. I usually stay away from contemporary novels because I have enough of real life already and I've been really disappointed before. I also knew I've found a few really greatly characterized ones before that I've ended up loving completely so sometimes that risk is really worth it. The benefit sometimes of not having a fantastical setting means we get to know the characters even more! Eleanor and Park were no exception.<br /><br />I knew as soon as I was through the first few chapters that I was hooked and shouldn't have doubted all of those fantastic reviews of praise that got me to look into this book. I still can't decide between them to say which of them is my favorite. They both have their quirky sides as well as the vulnerable, the strong, the weaknesses. All piled together it seems like maybe they couldn't work together but, really, they're just completely adorable and wonderful in every scene they spend talking to each other.<br /><br />By the end of the book I just couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what was going to happen. Everything that had escalated through the book came to a climax that I wasn't expecting at all. There was the plot twist I never saw coming, then everything that led up to the first chapter from Park's point of view that was obviously coming from after the bulk of the book was taking place.<br /><br />I really don't think that I can say enough good things about this book. There's friendship, hope, love, and trust. There are two fantastic leading characters who each take their turn narrating the novel and showing what their lives are like both alone and with the other title character. There are great secondary characters and there's a fantastic setting and plot. Just read it, okay?
B0098460O4|5.0|There's something about the two of them singing together that is so delightful.  While Jonathan's singing is superb, I find myself loving Charlotte's voice more and more every time I listen!  They compliment each other so beautifully.  Thank goodness they stayed together as a singing duet!!!  Absolutely a must buy if you want quality music added to your collection. I highly recommend this CD.

B001C4Z6SO|4.0|David Gilmour is great,have been a Pink Floyd fan for years.The only issue I have with the purchase of the 3CD set was the video of the concert will not play on my DVD,it says foreign for mat is not compatible.I was looking forward to watching the concert.If I had known this probably would not have bought it.So what do we do.
B00D02Z1EA|3.0|Full disclosure, I became a fan of ABR immediately after \\"Thrillseeker,\\" and was most happy with \\"Constellations.\\"  If you know the band well, you can probably see where this review is going...<br /><br />During their initial three-album run, they offered up some of the best that Metal(core) had to offer.  Catchy, punishing and relentless songs, each with their own flavor, but which all blended together into play-straight-through albums.<br /><br />When \\"Leveler\\" dropped and sounded decidedly different from the previous releases, I didn't immediately begrudge them for trying to \\"progress\\" in their sound and musicality.  You cannot get angry with artists for experimenting in attempts to grow beyond their boundaries (whether self, or fan, imposed).  That being said, the sound they had cultivated and mastered previous to \\"Leveler\\", the music that made fans respect them as masters of Metalcore, had become lesser for their genre-bending experimentation.  And now the progressive seed planted in \\"Leveler,\\" has sprouted and grows on in prominence in \\"Rescue & Restore.\\" In some instances this experimentation feels more natural on the newest release, but in others it's noticeably forced and heavy-handed.<br /><br />So at the risk of sounding myopic about the Metalcore genre (and incurring the rage of still-adoring ABR fans)...<br /><br />If I wanted to listen to flamenco guitars, brass, strings and Jamaican percussion, or even just \\"Progressive Metal\\" there are so many acts that simply do those things much, much better than ABR, and those other bands are where I already get my fix of the varying kinds of music put on display in \\"R&R.\\"  Not having read band interviews during the recording of this release, I was hoping for a return to form here, and that ABR would once again be the band to turn to for the best of the best Metalcore.  Instead, the opposite is true.<br /><br />While there are still tracks, riffs and licks as blistering as anything they've done before, as a whole,the feeling of the album continues to meander further into territory first wandered into during \\"Leveler.\\" And if you're truly an ABR fan, you're probably listening to these albums straight through, so the flavor as a whole means everything here.<br /><br />Now, If ABR ever decided to write and release a true, completely \\"Progressive Metal\\" album, I'd be excited to hear it... but the in between act and somewhat haphazard mixing of genre elements on \\"R&R\\" ends up making all of the varied pieces here more mediocre. It's an instance where the whole sounds lesser than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />But a sincere bravo to ABR for stretching their musical muscles and testing the boundaries of the genre they've obviously outgrown. I'm genuinely happy for all the new (and old) fans that enjoy it.<br /><br />However, after being disappointed with the direction of \\"Leveler,\\" and listening to this release a few times, I know I can now walk away from ABR with a clean conscience.
0763619612|5.0|This is one of my very favorite children's books.  Highly recommended for beginning a discussion on creativity and art with your child.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|This compilation of CD's is outstanding! Joni Mitchell's artistry is amazing. Music and lyrics like this are beautiful and rare. it does not get any better!
0307279189|5.0|I bought this based on an in person recommendation. So glad! This book really changed the way I think about distance running and inspired me to break boundaries and run further. If you doubt your ability to go further and faster- read this.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I don't know exactly what it was but something just felt off about this movie. It seemed like one of those movies where the studio and the creative team wanted different things so the movie wound up somewhere in between filled with compromises instead of artistic vision. Most of the actors seemed to struggle with all the green screen - especially a hammy James Franco - and the script didn't fully work. It wasn't a terrible movie, but I felt that it could have been so much better than how it turned out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire is one of my favorite books! My other favorites are the rest of the trilogy. Everything is so real that it is almost scary. Suzanne Collins is a profound writer and brings katniss' struggles, hopes and dreams alive in the pages of this book.
0316223239|4.0|After one page of this book I was ready to put it down and chalk it up as just one more unreadable book I had spent money on.  However, I turned to the middle of the book to see if the writing style changed at all and then decided to give it another chance.  I am very glad I did.  This book is probably one of the strangest books I have ever read.  Written from a young child's eyes, it tells of a horrific tale which was made less horrifying to read about through the innocence of the boy.  The boy and his mom had lived within one small room for his entire life.  After escaping to the \\"real\\" world, the boy's unblemished view of real and unreal is fresh and funny and poignant.  I hated the book for the darkness of the subject matter, but I loved it for making me think so deeply about how we live within our society and the things we view as normal or abnormal.  I would recommend this book and encourage you to give it more than the first few pages before you decide if it's one you will finish or pass along to someone else.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story moved a little slowly for my tastes. It didn't really hook me and hold my attention. The ending was a surprise which made up for some of the tedium.
0812983459|5.0|I agree with one reviewer that this book does read at a slow and sometimes plodding pace.  That is part of the charm of it.  The main character,Harold Fry, begins his slow, plodding walk in an unusual, unlikely way with no preparation, planning or forethought.  This book is filled with so many turns and unexpected changes that I couldn't wait to read the next chapter to see what might evolve on those pages.  I love books with lessons or perhaps only reminders of ourselves as all part of the same human race and this book is filled with truisms- particularly towards the end.  Once I finished it I actually sighed and said (to no one in particular),\\" wow!  What a great book!\\"  What better reading experience could a person have?
B00BN1QV1M|5.0|Here's another omnium gatherum at super budget price of the kind that seems to be flooding the market from every major label.  This one covers the young Abbado's Decca recordings from 1966-69, when he flourished with the London Symphony (technically, the Decca years aren't over: Abbado recently recorded a Fidelio and aria recital album, both featuring the superb German tenor Jonas Kaufmann). These seven CDs represent the nine LPs he made for Decca, dominated by LSO recordings but straying occasionally to other orchestras. Most of the individual CDs are still in print, especially in Europe, and only one or two are hard to find on the used market.<br /><br />Before making any detailed comments, here's the contents of the set.<br /><br />Beethoven:<br /><br />Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92<br /><br />Wiener Philharmoniker<br /><br />Symphony No. 8 in F major, Op. 93<br /><br />Wiener Philharmoniker<br /><br />The Creatures of Prometheus Overture, Op. 43<br /><br />Wiener Philharmoniker<br /><br />Brahms:<br /><br />Rinaldo, Op. 50<br /><br />New Philharmonia Orchestra<br /><br />Schicksalslied, Op. 54<br /><br />New Philharmonia Orchestra<br /><br />Bruckner:<br /><br />Symphony No. 1 in C minor<br /><br />Wiener Philharmoniker<br /><br />Hindemith:<br /><br />Symphonic Metamorphoses on Themes by Carl Maria von Weber<br /><br />Janacek:<br /><br />Sinfonietta<br /><br />Mendelssohn:<br /><br />Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 56 'Scottish'<br /><br />Symphony No. 4 in A major, Op. 90 'Italian'<br /><br />Prokofiev:<br /><br />Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25 'Classical'<br /><br />Symphony No. 3 in C minor, Op. 44<br /><br />Chout - Suite, Op.21a<br /><br />Romeo and Juliet Suite<br /><br />Verdi:<br /><br />Gli arredi festivi (from Nabucco)<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra<br /><br />Va, pensiero (from Nabucco)<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra<br /><br />Chi v'impose unirvi a noi? (from Macbeth)<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra<br /><br />O patria ... O tu, Palermo (from I Vespri Siciliani)<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra<br /><br />A te l'estremo addio ... Il lacerato spirito (from Simon Boccanegra)<br /><br />London Symphony Orchestra<br /><br />If duplication is an issue, the Beethoven items were repeated on DG, sometimes several times over. Even as a young man - Abbado turned 33 in 1966 - he took a relatively restrained approach to Beethoven (it used to be called Apollonian), which in a way predicted the rise of the anti-heroic period performance movement. But the Vienna Phil. is far from a HIP ensemble, and their beautiful playing shines through in Sym. 7 and 8.  Abbado went on to complete a Beethoven cycle with them in the Seventies. (Since my copy is a download, I can't verify if there's an actual overlap here. I assume not, since the later cycle came out on DG, but Decca's website is no help.) I am not a fan of the Vienna cycle, much preferring the later two with Berlin, but if you like such poised restraint, the Seventh and Eighth were probably Abbado's most successful interpretations from this period.<br /><br />My greatest enthusiasm goes to the Hindemith, Prokofiev, and Janacek works, which rank among the best I know on disc.  All are highlights of Abbado's early career. The Bruckner First from 1970 - not the remake from 1997 - is new to me (it can be bought singly on a new Decca Eloquence bargain disc issued in Australia), and it's doubly attractive for featuring Vienna again, since I can't think of another commercial version of the Bruckner First with them. This recording dates from a time when this formative work was held in low regard and was recorded basically to fill out a complete symphonic cycle. Abbado's reading is low-key and elegant, but the orchestral work is lovely, and he becomes more involved in the moody Beethovenesque slow movement.<br /><br />The Mendelssohn \\"Scottish\\" and \\"Italian\\" sound the same to me as the LSO versions with Abbado in their complete cycle for DG, but the latteris digital, so they are in fact different. Both readings are vibrant without quite rivaling the best. The disc of Brahms choral works is a genuine rarity on the used market, although the Rinaldo with tenor James King as soloist made a big impression when first released; it remains among the best. Finally, the Verdi selections are from a program of scenes featuring the great Bulgarian bass Nicolai Ghiaurov in his astounding prime. I hadn't known of it and derived great pleasure from being reminded of opera's last golden age.<br /><br />The sound is excellent on every disc, and despite the duplications and a bit of less than satisfying Beethoven - not that everyone will agree - this budget box set is full of memorable performances (it's also very worthwhile to seek out Abbado's other LSO recordings on DG, which continue the winning streak).is digital, so they are in fact different.

B00004WEJZ|1.0|Just received this purchase today and couldn't wait to watch it....WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A WASTE OF MONEY . This is absolutely the worse film I have ever seen. Sean Connery's acting was the worst performance ever in the part as 007. All the other actors were also hideous. They even stuck Mr Bean in the movie for a bit part. The movie starts off poorly , and continues to go from bad to worse.I started to fast forward through several parts hoping to get to a respectable part, but never did. Ultimately, I couldn't watch any more. It is that bad. There is no scene progression to follow through the movie. It's nothing more than a chop job of aimless dialog that makes it impossible to follow. You couldn't even understand some of the dialog from Connery through his strong slurring of his words through his accent.This movie should have  been titled \\" Never Should Have Been Made\\" This is not a true Bond film and should have been burned or totally chopped up and left on the cutting room floor.The producer should be ashamed of this piece of crap, and Sean Connery should be ashamed of himself for being part of this train wreck. This was not a final fond farewell for him as 007, but rather a crash and burn...

B004HWYTP4|3.0|Entertaining, but lots of holes in the story.<br />Worth watching but don't try to find logic or continuity.<br />John Malkovich is excellent, Bruce Willis is at home and Helen Mirren has a good sense of humor.

B004X4R3FE|5.0|Loved the movie! However, the streaming left a lot to be desired. multiple times during the viewing it would just freeze. I would have to go comepletely out of Amazon and back in to get it going again. I NEVER have this problem with ohter companies.

B005OMOKN2|5.0|There is nothing spectacular about a battery. It is nice to have as a backup, especially if you're a photography buff like I am. Compact cameras tend to burn more battery juice than DSLR cameras, so a day's worth of continuous shoots tend to drain the battery fast. But with the recharger in hand and a few batteries to spare, I'm in good shape.

0307476073|4.0|Wild is a memoir that tells how Cheryl Strayed tried to overcome first her mother's death and the distancing of her siblings, and then her divorce.  By chance she spies a book on hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  After some thought, she decides to hike the trail, with no previous hiking experience ever.  The trail extends from California all the way to Washington State and without even a shred of an idea of what she was undertaking she starts off with \\"Monster\\" her pack, so heavy she can't put it on without sitting down with support, and begins an adventure to find herself and heal the wounds that were so severely marked on her soul.<br /><br />I had heard and seen much about this book, but never thought that it would be my type of book.  Even though I am very fond of memoirs, I was a bit afraid that this would be like the book, EAT PRAY LOVE.  But, the more I saw and read about the book, the more interested I became.  This was our book club choice for this month and I am so glad I had the opportunity to read it.<br /><br />The beginning of the book was a little slow for me as she recounted her childhood and struggles with poverty and with her siblings.  Since I am familiar with the Minnesota Northwoods, I did enjoy her descriptions of growing up there and their simple lifestyle.  The cycle of drugs/sex/more drugs got old fast and her poor me attitude was frustrating.  She wasn't the first to lose her mother and get divorced and the world didn't stop because of it. The Pacific Crest Trail was just what she needed.<br /><br />Once Cheryl begins the Pacific Crest Trail, the more interested I became in the story.  I was rooting for her every step of the way.  As she lost each toe nail...I cringed.  I was prodding her along even when the normal person would have given up, like when she was using duct tape to keep her sandals together and getting by with just twenty cents until her next stop.  While she walked through the groceries stores dreaming of drinking a Snapple Lemonade or eating a bag of chips it reminded me of all that we all take for granted and how easy it is to get whatever we want.  If I'm hungry for pizza I order it, if I want chocolate, I go to the cupboard and grab a candy bar.  Her boxes of goodies waiting at the next checkpoint became her lifeline and reason for moving forward.<br /><br />As she finished the trail, I wept and cheered at the same time.  I was disappointed because she skips right ahead to the present.  I would have liked to known more about her recovery from the trail, including how her body healed, how it was to be sleeping in bed again, eating the food she dreamed about, and mostly being in the city where it is loud and busy.<br /><br />I was hoping for a few photos inserted in the book along the way.  She carried her camera along for the whole trip and I would have loved to see documentation of the hike and the scenery.<br /><br />Ultimately, we follow along as Cheryl intimately lets us in on her feelings and we witness her letting go of her anger and allowing herself to forgive.  Being willing to forgive and let go can really be the ultimate healer, but a life changing one thousand plus mile trek across the wilderness can do the trick as well.  Watching her process her mother's death, her loss of contact with her family, her divorce and her loss of herself will lead you to take note of your own failings in life and maybe even come to grips with some of them.  I'm thrilled she was able to share her journey with us.monade or eating a bag of chips it reminded me of all that we all take for granted and how easy it is to get whatever we want.

B005XLN97M|5.0|My daughter hand picked this with the amazon gift card her grandma sent her. It came and was significantly bigger than I estimated, which was a plus for her. Not such an issue for me either because it's easily foldable and portable from one room to the next. My daughter is 8 and totes it around herself, no problem. It gets much use, nothing has broken, even with a physical toddler poking around on it, so we (mom and daughter) are both happy campers and feel it was money well spent.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|SUCKS ITS SLOW AND STUPID!!!!  THE TOCA HAIR 2 SALON IT MUCH MUCH BETTER!!!!! I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I GOT THIS APP!!! SO I GOT THE TOCA HAIR 2!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an amazing story of a journey into heart of our existence.  I could not put this book down and thank the author for sharing his journey with us.
B0072OFM28|5.0|All I can say is Love it..It would have cost so much more to buy in a store.. So glad I bought them..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. It keeps your mind sharp. You have to think beyond the usual. I like how they have put math in the problem solving.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you love this series you will not find it any cheaper anywhere else..Can't wait till the last one comes out in September..
159514188X|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I wanted to know the next story on the next cassette.  We get so wrapped up in our own lives, especially once out of high school and do not look at the little things that could impact someone else's life.  Even if it is a small fraction of an event.  Different moments mean different things to everyone and those moments should not go unnoticed.  I've never dealt with any one close to me committing suicide but that shouldn't matter, we should be watching out for every one around us.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Ok so this is the man who got me wanting to watch the series.. Andy Whitfield was the bomb..R.I.P Andy you were the true Spartacus.

159463176X|2.0|After two wonderfully written, deeply moving books, Dr. Hosseini misses with &#34;Mountains&#34;. He attempts an epic story covering 3 generations, leap frogging through time and moving his characters around the globe -Afghanistan, Greece, France and USA. The author creates some well crafted characters and story lines only to drop them and jump to another thread and point in time. The story line concludes with unabashed sentimentiality and many unanswered questions. In a word, it is &#34;threadbare&#34;.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|this movie was great, would see it again. had suspence and action which I love in watching a movie on tv.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved finishing the game. It was a great way to spend time and test your brain. I didn't want to stop
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game but make sure you have pen and paper to write down clues.  asbestos puzzle. game I have played in a while.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I highly recommend this album. Even if you don't like trance / club mixes, you may still love this artist.
193700788X|5.0|I could not wait to get my Sookie Stackhouse novel! This is the last in the series and I was litterally on the edge of my seat for a year waiting for my book in the mail. Couldn't have been happier with my pre-order and delivery :D
B009CF3P7E|4.0|Movie is good. I'm a Star Trek the Next Generation fan personally and not much for all these reboots going on lately. However, they did a decent job with this movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great and addicting - I wish there were more levels.  I like that they get progressively more challenging
B003UMW68Y|5.0|The songs are great, the kids love it, and every time I watch it I remember why I loved it so much the first time.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Taylor Swift's 2012 album packs much of the same punch as her prior three: smartly married lyrics and melody, catchy tunes mixed with the somber ballads, an excellent collection of songs that defy genre. Indeed, although many of RED's tracks are slow (ex. \\"All Too Well,\\" \\"The Last Time\\"), slowness alone obviously does not a country song make. Despite rare country-infused gems like \\"Begin Again,\\" make no mistake: RED is a pop album first and foremost.<br /><br />That is not to say RED is not a good listen, or a solid album that I have come to expect of this seasoned vet. Every track is single-quality and could stand alone perfectly well. Where Miss Swift's deluxe edition was a tentative first step into country pop, Fearless was the stuff of a teenage diary, and Speak Now was borne of fairytale romance and dreams, RED represents a more mature look at relationships (albeit tempered with temper and angst, as all artists are wont to do). I for one am very much looking forward to whatever else this young star has to offer in the future.<br /><br />My favorites: Treacherous, I Knew You Were Trouble, All Too Well, 22, The Last Time, Starlight, Begin Again<br />The ones I skip: I Almost Do, Stay Stay Stay, Holy Ground, The Moment I Knew<br />* Whichever ones you in particular lean towards or don't prefer as much has much more to do with personal preference than the quality of the actual track. I am perfectly able to the entire 22-track deluxe edition through - but am equally ready to pick out specific favorites, or mix them with the music of other artists in personal playlists.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This is required reading for all zombie fans, but the different style of story telling (each chapter is an interview with a different person and when put together tell the main story) may turn others off.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Same plot. Different sleazy location. To think they did a trilogy of the same story line. I am invested now so I will watch the last of the series.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a really good read, although it did get a bit predictable toward the end.  Also, the end seems undeveloped and rushed, like the author was running out of time, and just had to throw an ending in there.  But, all in all, a good read.
0345525558|5.0|Wonderful, heart-warming story - especially if you have an appreciation for flowers like I do.  But anyone should be able to enjoy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is very entertaining and I love it. Only problem is that it signs me out every few games when I don't shut off my kindle.
B001974DG0|5.0|Awesome story!  Amazing work by my favorite author!  A must read for sure!!  Settle in for action, a precious love story and maybe a little dog slobber!!!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book changed the way I see people around me. I loved it! I can't wait to get I copy, I plan to frame it and hang it on my wall in order to remember to watch my actions!
1423140605|4.0|Amazon shipped me a bad copy of the book. Several pages were misprinted (it was missing pages and had duplicate pages). While I didn't rate the book poorly based on that, it does make me hesitant to purchase any more physical copies of books from Amazon again.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I liked it. It wasn't as good as others in the series. The plot went off in different directions following each character's Point of View. By the end of the book, you are left with a bittersweet ending. SPOILERS: it is a cliffhanger ending. I would recommend flipping through this book either at a bookstore or library or a sample online before purchasing.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I would watch Tommy Lee Jones in anything. I felt this was not one of his better movies. Plot was ok.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great version of the classic card game! Great for road trips and its simple enough for the kids to use.
0765325950|5.0|perfect ending
B007REV4YI|5.0|. . . this is the best of all of the Bond movies.  I'm not a huge fan of Daniel Craig, but he does a pretty good job in this one.  I'm sure a LOT of people will disagree with me which is why I said &#34;in my OPINION.&#34;  I think the story line is pretty good.  There are a few &#34;dry&#34; spots in the movie, but when it moves, it moves.
B000002VMD|3.0|I don't know why, but I expected more songs by Whitney Houston.  I guess it had been too long ago since I viewed the movie and just forgot.  The album is okay though
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game. Very realistic, much like the movie. Having lots of fun!<br />If you enjoy defending your territory, or just like a challenge. This is the game you. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It really gets you thinking. I love finding the glues! So far so good. Can't wait to see how many levels I reach.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|The quality is outstanding, I would buy another.  I bought other brands and they did not fit my knidle and they were always falling down.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|First, Rihanna acting??? laughable!<br /><br />Second, the guy who played \\"Gambit\\", not that good of a lead actor.<br /><br />Third, the concept? Aliens!!! stop it!!<br /><br />Fourth, Liam Neeson, should be ashamed for having worked in this film.<br /><br />Fifth, based on the board game? Yeah right!<br /><br />I sat for like 40 to 55 minutes of the movie and got tired of it. The special effects were good but it was just a \\"cheap\\" knockoff of some other films that have dealt with this. Stealth comes to mind.<br /><br />The movie itself should be rated worse.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|good matching game, easy to use. The tablet features of tap and slide to move the cube around are fun change to games like these from the old computer mouse.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzel was amazing in this movie. The acting was stellar, I didn't know what to expect from the previews but when I sat and watched it, it took off.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Don't get me wrong. Sylvia should have ended the book. I LOVED the story line in this book but she is dragging it out. I read she is writing two more books to end the series. I was so pissed off the only reason I'm reading the books is because I have to see how it ends.<br />Enough complaining.<br /><br />I LOVED the story and once again sylvia you out did yourself with the love scenes. Dawn Eva and Gideon are hot. And when they get started I have to take breaks because I get to hot. I really love how they are growing in their relationship and trusting each other. I don't want to spoil the read for anyone. But I'm really looking forward to the next book. I can't wait to see what happens with the exes. But I know Eva and Gideons relationship will survive.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|The movie is pretty long, the switching of the scenarios and time makes it confusing. The acting is good but it would have been better suited for tv than a movie, and as the ratings and Box Office showed, it would have.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Finally kingdom rush came out on kindle I have played it on pc and is amazing so worth 1.99 so many cool add ons to the computer version.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Bradley Cooper sickens me simply because he's everywhere nowadays but his role here was stellar. Lawrence is becoming a top actress in Hollywood, very well done movie.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I'm just looking for someone to talk to(clean), and wanting to meet new people<br />Kik me at luisd94 18 male.

B003NRYMZQ|5.0|A spin off from Dr. Who.<br />Watch and you will be hooked.<br />Now I'm off to watch another show, have a nice day!
8866137634|5.0|Notebook quality is fantastic and the ability to use this notebook  in conjunction with evernote is a plus. Also having a 3 month premium subscription for evernote also make this notebook worth it.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love this update of the Sherlock Holmes character to modern-day.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are excellent in their respective roles.  I only wish there were more episodes.
B00BX50UEC|5.0|Everyone's tastes in music may vary; but you can always find something to like in this compilation of European nations competing for the number one spot in May 2013 event, and right to host the next &#34;Eurovision&#34; contest next May. This years winner was Denmark with the song &#34;Only Teardrops&#34;, performed by Emmelie de Forest. I loved this one, and eighteen others on the album. I also found that one does not have to understand the language to appreciate the music and vocals; four of mine are in something other than English, music just has a language of its own!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great book, I think Suzanne Collins is a brilliant person, and this turned out to be a very popular too She also used some very interesting names, I liked them. (I give it 5 stars. if I could I would give it 10 stars)  :)
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Also backed by research and personal experience. I'm going to use it in my capstone class for their journal assignment.
B0029O0BLS|3.0|Given the previous reviews I've seen this wasn't as bad as I expected.  It wasn't horribly bad, but it wasn't all that great either.  It fell squarely in the middle of meh...<br /><br />I went into it expecting a sci-fi horror film, but it really just ended up being an action film.  I don't know what it was supposed to be really, but it didn't end up being anything concrete.<br /><br />If this was supposed to be a horror movie there just wasn't enough suspense.  It looked like a bunch of action scenes taped together with some boring dialog between the characters.  On top of that I didn't really like any of the characters.  I couldn't really root for any of them.  About as close as I got was Samuel L. Jackson's character, but he just ended up acting nutty (as the role was cast I guess) most of the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the movie just tried to be too much and failed to be anything?  I don't know, maybe I'll watch it again in a couple years and come to a different conclusion.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I just loved this game. A really interesting challenge w/ a deep story and some unexpected twists. Kept me guessing. Played it on my Droid RAZR Maxx HD and loved it.
0374532990|4.0|Not only are the pictures beautiful but you get the history behind The High Line and the journey it took from abandoned eyesore to beautiful city park.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very addictive game. If you love puzzles,problems,riddles,etc. This is the game for you. You may even get a headache trying to figure the levels out. But you comeback for more!
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Have watched the Beach Boys since the early 60s.  As an avid &#34;old&#34; surfer (65) I appreciate being able to see them again.  A shame it had to be without Dennis and Carl.  The old sound was there and the electricity of Mike Love came through to take me back in time.  Thank you Amazon for allowing me the order in advance.
B00CW665VI|2.0|I have read books from a mans point of view before, but this was too much.  The author paints this guy as a total jack ass.  I really wish I could type what I'd really like to call him, because jackass and pig just don't do it.  He's a self absorbed, spoiled, ego maniac.  If he approached me in a club or the work place, I'd tell him to take a long walk on a short pier.  I had a really hard time feeling sorry for the guy when Kate rebuffed him.  The first and only time he gets a dent in his ego, he turns to mush, then he's over the top trying to get her back.  I have NO clue how this book is rated so high.  Good luck.
B00932A4XE|4.0|The story did not get too sappy or mushy and was pretty entertaining overall. Plus the acting and lines flowed well
B0091REZMW|5.0|When I started playing I was pleasantly surprised it's a good game my five year old and I play together I tell her what she needs to do and,she does it.  We enjoy it.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Ok, for $4.00, but the story was lacking, the backrounds weren't even as good as the original, and we have so much more to work with-so there is no excuse why it could not have looked more realistic.<br /><br />It's a $4.00 movie-thank God I didn't go see it in the theater.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I got 3 albums almost at the same time, Kendrick Lamar GKMC, Yeezus, and this album.<br /><br />After reading all the reviews i decided to star with Kendrick,and i was surprise by the fact that it wasnt that classic album that everybody said, yes it has great moments but nothing spectacular either: Rhyming great, Beats mediocre (Although Poetic Justice is one of the best ive heard) Lyrics repetitive an nothing fresh, so i got bored quickly.<br /><br />With that disappointment, i decided to listen to this album thinking of saving the best for last. But what a surprise, i was wrong!! THIS IS THE ALBUM I SHOULD STARTED WITH. Rhyming great, Beats awesome, Lyrics good but it could be a little better, never the less this album is almost perfect, i didnt like that much #6,7 but maybe with time. This is one of those rare albums that you can hear it all the way through, maybe youll want to repet one or two.<br /><br />The problem is... that for now, i only want to hear this album hehe, So sorry Kanye i will hear you in a couple of days, you can blame Cole LOL.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Combines a lot of past arcade games (Galaga, Gorf, Galaxian, et al) yet still has its own feel. Very nicely done, and short waves mean I can play it for a couple minutes or a couple of hours.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book is so informative about how to take care of your curly hair.  Very helpful and easy to follow.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|I love this disk. I have every CD that Nick Cave and the Badseeds have put out. My favorite Badseed album is &#34;The Boatman's Call&#34; and this Cd reflects the style of that album. The only thing that I hate is my favorite guitar player Bargeld didn't play in this. But it's a wonderful piece and the DVD is awesome; so glad that I got the limited edition of the album.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book, amazingly good things, but I wasn't sure it was for me - I was so wrong. This is a thrilling, thought provoking novel. Love it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is one of the best ones ever. I agree with other's reviews about it being tough, but not too difficult. I have played computer games in the past that this reminds me of (Myst, Killing Moon, etc)<br />I cannot WAIT for more levels in this game!<br />I highly recommend the download.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|So I decided to wait to write this review after it was played with for a little while. We have had this for over 6 months and I am surprised to say it is still going strong. It is not the most realistic spider but my daughter does not seem to mind, she loves to get the dog going with it. The remote is still going strong also. The remote is pretty easy to use and the spider is easy enough for her to control with no help. My 4 year old niece could not work it very easy, she got frustrated quickly. I would say it is definitely 5 and over for the no frustration factor. It was played with a lot to begin with, but like anything only comes out once and a while now. I am not sure how durable it would be if the child is rough on there toys, she is 8 and somewhat gentle. It would not survive my 3 year old nephew:)
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 5year old grandson absolutely loves this.  Never to early to teach them how to cook. Maybe he will grow up to be a chef.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series with all the intrigue. It is fascinating to see how these old place might have worked. The dedication of the staff is heartwarming even with the pettiness mixed with affection and respect... Or not. I recommend Downton Abbey - if the first one doesn't catch you the second one will!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Loved it, I had not really read Thor and loved the story line.  The streaming to my kindle was without interruption.... !!! Yea again loved it
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is interesting and I look forward to watching all the ones I've missed  as well as the new series.
B00AK57N00|1.0|This game is really very boring: the first jump is really the same as the jump you do later on progressing in the game. It really doesn't matter how further you go in the game. Still the jumps are all the same as the first one.<br /><br />Uninstalled after less than 15 minutes.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I had this game on my ipod touch, first game i downloaded when i bought the Fire Hd,  Lots of upgrades you can earn as you play.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Here's the thing when I first heard  the lady wore black back in the day it was on a cassette passed on from a fellow musician and die hard underground metal fan. I was instantly in love with heavy metal, and this amazing band called Queensryche. The next albums the warning, rage for order, operation mindcrime, empire all continued to fuel my passion for this band. Then began the downfall. The next album was just ok, but I still had hope, then with each release I began to lose faith to the point that I would become physically sick to even listen to the new material that was being released.  Now years later it has finally happened the band I loved the bad that had influenced my songwriting and guitar playing has returned. I can finally proudly blast a Queensryche cd from my car stereo once again like I did in 1988. Finally. The Ryche I loved has returned. It is sad that Tate could not hear what we the fans needed, but I'm so thankful that the rest of the band did what needed to be done. So I'm hoping this is just the beginning of a new era of Queensryche. Finally I can proudly say Queensryche is my favorite band once again. Buy this cd, Now. Help them rise from the ashes.
B00AAZOKS8|4.0|The book was Good but almost too short. My boys ages 2 & 4 liked it, it just isn't long enough to wind them down.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really liked this series but as it goes on, you can tell it has been a long series. These later books didn't hold my attention as well as the first books in the series but still enjoyed reading them. I still felt this one is good for four stars
B009NY43NY|4.0|Big fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series. I've been waiting for this book to come out for a long time. Like the story. Didn't like that there was very little Eric.
B006YC74E8|5.0|My title say's it all. I have MS and with it comes severe cognitive difficulties and Photo Editor is not only easy to use but does everything perfectly! My pictures look great and now I can share them with no flaws.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album has very smart lyrics, catchy beats, and deep issues.  Growing up in the 90's, it's nice to see the genre branch out from the \\"pimpin ho's and slangin' caine\\" themes a bit (tho those always have a special place in my heart).  And this guy's better than Vanilla Ice - he's bustin stereotypes left and right!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The game looks as good on my 8.9 fire HD as it does on my laptop, and is as easy to play as well.  The new sealed format looks great as a way to help transition players to Magic online or Friday night Magic play.<br /><br />Worth the extra cost to unlock full features and large space, if you like Magic and want away to play anywhere.
B00A6CT012|5.0|Bea is an absolute inspiration; she provides intriguing and interesting solutions to every day occurrences that generate unnecessary waste in the modern home.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Very good movie, reminiscent of Spielbergs other movies such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Very enjoyable
B008K6HN8I|5.0|the new Kindle fire HD does not come with adobe flash player. Thanks for ES file explorer to save the day.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Don't expect the orignal fairy tale to be acted out here. But the movie is fun and non-stop action. It's a weird mix of our English and Old English...I think the writers were having fun with that. Oldman is pretty good, but nothing like he was in Dracula. I would imagine now that outside Batman, he doesn't get the roles he used to and that's a pity, because he's a great actor. Expect some humor, intentional and not. If you take this movie too seriously, you won't like it.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Not a classic but worth watching. Mark plays a good role in this one. Not something I would purchase on DVD. Should have waited to watch on cable.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|I can't really review this move without a spoiler. So...I can tell you it's a nearly perfect plot and mind %^&k. Dennis Quaid can be wonderful in movies or a compete dud. Rarely is he somewhere in-between. This is one of those times. Take him out and put another actor in his place and you have one of the all-time greatest sci-fi movies. Prometheus by comparison, is a long running, expensive joke. I guessed the plot of this movie about a third of the way in. But it's still a thriller to the end. Leaves you wanting more or a sequel. Great ride, this one.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I saw this young lady on America's Got Talent as a hip hop violinist and was very impressed - I bought her CD and listen to it quite often - especially when I'm cleaning house!  It really gets me moving.  You need to keep an eye on this girl.
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|Graphics a bit painful for 7 inch tablet, as the 3D display needs to be enlarged and reduced - slight change of graphic woul make this perfect..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun game to play. It was challenging but also fun to figure out. I hope new levels come out soon.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|loved the third season... can't wait for the twists and turns of the fourth season! I will not spoil it for you but... third season was interesting to say the least!
193700788X|5.0|I am gonna miss this character which has far more character than the True Blood Sookie.  It could have gone many ways for how things ended and Charlaine did a great job of tying up the loose ends with many of the favorite characters in this series!
B002PEP4C8|4.0|This is an honest and heartfelt account  of rape and the after effects.  Alice Seabold writes vividly about  her encounter and  the trial that ensues.  I found  myself hooked after the first few pages.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have been using yahoo mail since 1998 never a problem and like the app highly recommend this for you
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie, great message, heartwarming. Actually funny for adults (clever dialogue that is over the kid's heads). You'll want to hug the main &#34;bad guy&#34; character by the end.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I really gave me new perspective on life, couldn´t get it out of my head for several days. I really started to think about my dreams for life.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a great film. I enjoyed it very much and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Unfortunately I don't know enough of Lincoln's history to comment on how accurate the portrayal is, but it's a great story and an incredible performance by Daniel Day Lewis.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I only bought it because I thought this is the last book in series, but unfortunately it did not have anything interesting in it...
B000002AHM|5.0|Great and fun to listen to. Never heard such playing and so fast, Hard to imagine. Wish they would do more.
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|The controls are a bit weird and sometimes laggy. And the game goes from to easy to really tough pretty fast. Not my cup of tea
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|loved it, reading it again, well written and informative.<br />Well researched a must read for any one with a disability
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Made it possible to install flash so i can use me device for what i like thank you verry much
0470932139|5.0|A perfect book for anyone interested in photography! Very nice explanations to light and color. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to use pictures on his/her blog or webpage!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book had many twists and excitement in it. Once I read it, I couldn't put it down!<br />I will defiantly get the next book!
B0098460O4|1.0|some engineer on the sound board did not do sound checks and the result is that the instruments drown out the voices.  The music completely covers those beautiful voices.  This piece of garbage should be remastered-------- then I might buy one!
0062231375|5.0|Read this book! I loved the additions of his handwritten notes and updates, especially since it was published long ago.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Sheldon is one of the best characters around. I wasn't the biggest fan of season 4, but this season was much better.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charger is amazing! Its long so you can actually sit away from the outlet and its nice and sturdy! Great charger!! Buy this!!
B004U8VX2M|4.0|For those of us looking for a period piece to tide us over to season 4 of DA, this is an acceptable substitute.  The acting/script isn't the best I ever saw and to be honest, I kind of laugh at the sets.  After all, I'm used to the lord and lady being at Highclere Castle and what would EVER compare to that?  But that being said, it is really worth watching and I've grown very fond of several of the characters.  I'm just ready to start watching season 3 and I will not stop till I've seen them all.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|cool mouse and perfect for gaming but wish the company didn't cheat me into buying it. NO WHERE does it say it isn't compatible with mac books. I can use it but cannot open the interface and install the software required for the mouse on to my laptop. I cannot change any mouse speeds or use the extras that the mouse offers. Thanks for hiding an important piece of information from buyers. Perfect for windows though i will not lie. Just upset i was not told ahead of time..
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is fun.  I just wish you did not have to spend money to complete some early goals in the game.  It should be more and easier ways to get the pearls
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This item has proven to be a real asset for me.  I like to keep passages from books and magazines that have meant something special to me.  I actually do go back and read them once in a while.  And, it's good for keeping track of phone numbers, email addresses, etc.  It's easy to use, and I'd recommend it for those who like the less complicated ways of doing things.  It took me a while to figure out how to work the calendar section, but I think I have it now.  I do wish it had the holidays displayed on it.  Overall, I am pleased with it.
0425263924|1.0|I had hoped that the third book would of gotten better, but all of these are boring, there is no meat to these stories -- filling pages with sex does not save this lame story line.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It is a fun game, when you get to higher levels it requires much difficulty and continuously asks you to purchase more items to succeed, annoying.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Like many other fans who have experienced one after another disappointing Queensryche albums since \\"Promised Land\\" I awaited the new Queensryche release with equal amounts of eager anticipation and trepidation.  What if, even without Geoff Tate's self-indulgence, this album was another disappointment?<br /><br />It's not.  I received this album in the mail early, due to pre-ordering through the band's website so I've been able to listen for 4-5 days now.  This album (running time notwithstanding) is everything it promised to be.  The band sounds more passionate and vital than they have in years and their musicianship has only improved with time.<br /><br />Everyone is excellent on this album but, for me, the standout performer is Scott Rockenfield.  His drumming is truly spectacular.<br /><br />Each track is finely crafted and creates, while not a concept album, a thematically coherent album where each part supports the rest.<br /><br />X2 - This nice atmospheric track shows that the band can still provide that `progressive' sound even without DeGarmo and perfectly sets the tone for the next song.<br /><br />Where Dreams Go To Die - This song was my favorite song upon first listen and shows that the band can create a compelling, musically complex song that evokes the band at their most `progressive.'<br /><br />Spore - A solid rocker which I didn't take to as much right away but, upon each listen, I find there is something more to discover.<br /><br />In This Light - Another song that I didn't take to right away but who's melody has infected my brain and won't let go.<br /><br />Redemption - A really solid song.  I understand why this was the first `single' released online for fans to hear.<br /><br />Vindication - This song transitions from Redemption by shifting into high-gear and not letting up.  This and Where Dreams Go To Die are the two songs that address the rift between Queensryche and Geoff Tate and they are far classier and stand on their own artistic merits more than anything Tate wrote for F.U.<br />Midnight Lullaby - Another nice instrumental interlude which creates a melancholy feel for the next song.<br /><br />A World Without - This is a heart-wrenching ballad that is sad without being melodramatic or over-the-top.<br /><br />Don't Look Back - So far my least favorite of the songs but, as I like all of them, that's really not saying much.<br /><br />Fallout - This one is not only a great rockin' metal tune but also deftly uses rhythms and the internal metre of the lyrics to really drive it forward.  A very nice display of how both music and lyrics should support each other musically... something that a lot of bands miss.<br /><br />Open Road - A nice way to bring the album in for  a smooth `landing'.  This song evokes feelings of \\"Someone Else\\" or \\"Anybody Listening\\".<br /><br />The bonus live tracks show that the band is tighter than ever and that Todd can handle the vocal chores with no problem.<br /><br />The biggest compliment I can give the album is that I've listened to it at least 2-3 times a day since getting it and it hasn't grown old yet.  In fact I keep finding new things to draw me in deeper.<br /><br />It's been years since I've had that experience with any release, let alone a Queensryche release, and for that I definitely think this album is well worth the money and the wait.<br /><br />Queensryche is back!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Like it, but hard to navigate from category to category. Plans are good, but confusing. I would recommend this because you can share it on social media.
0425263991|5.0|I have read all 12 Psy-Changeling books and this one was just as great as the last 11! She keeps you so involved and interested. Things are coming to a head and I can not wait for book 13.
0812982622|1.0|I just finished a month-long slog through this book. First of all, it was about twice as long as it needed to be, with lots of extraneous description and story that did not support the main plot. The overall story was interesting, and the only reason I kept reading was to find out what happened to the characters at the end. But even though I liked the plot, I felt that the execution was deeply flawed. I also didn't care for the author's writing style. There were long stretches of VERY DRY writing. And the numerous loudspeaker announcements from the government were too long-winded. If he was trying to reflect reality with those announcements then he should have included a lot fewer of them. I won't give anything away, but the ending was immensely unsatisfying and disappointing.<br /><br />Part of me is surprised that this won the Pulitzer Prize. But part of me is not surprised, because this is definitely not the first time I've been unhappy with a Pulitzer Prize winner.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|You can always count on RAM to make a great product, and this is a very good one, compatible with the other items that they make. Very happy with product.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love the music of John Fogerty. This CD contains duets of some of his hits by various different artists. My favorite duet is \\"Someday Never Comes\\".  John sings this song with a new singer named Dawes.  This young man sounds great singing with John on this track.  This song is a reminder for me to learn all I can every day of my life.  My other favorite track is a new song entitled \\"Mystic Highway\\".  The lyrics of this song are very profound.  This song reminds me that every thing and every person  is connected in some way on this earth.  This song also makes me think of what happens to me when I die.  This song is spiritual without being religious, and I love it. Jennifer Hudson lends her vocal talent to the classic \\"Proud Mary\\".  I have heard this song covered many times.  It has a soulful tone because of Jennifer Hudson, but it stands out because it features fiddle playing.  The fiddle playing gives this song a  fun new tone I haven't heard of before. \\"Hot Rod Heart\\" is a great country duet with Brad Paisley.  This song lures me to the excitement of the open road in a beautiful car.  John duets with Bob Segar on the song \\"Who Will Stop The Rain\\".  This is a slower tempo song by two music legends.  Every line of this song sounds like a pearl of wisdom that I should try to remember.  John rocks out with the Foo Fighters on another classic tune \\"Fortunate Son\\".  This song sounds like part of a jam session. This tune really pumps me up.  This CD also exposes me to artists like The Zac Brown Band and Keith Urban.  I don't listen to country music that much.  I really enjoyed the Zac Brown Band helping out the song \\"Bad Moon Rising\\".  This song puts me in a good mood.  Keith Urban makes me long for the weekend with the song \\"Almost Saturday Night\\".  The music of John Fogerty touches at least one artist from rock, soul and country. I like this music very much.

B000IXUOP0|5.0|One click ordering, love the instant video streaming, love this series. As good as summer reading! Great on the iPAD.
B000SGGUWS|3.0|I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. It isn't bad. I did like it. I will probably continue reading the series. I picked it up because I'm a fan of the TV show, which is quite a bit farther along than just this book. It's interesting to see what has changed from book to TV. I don't think any of the main 4 characters look how they're described in the book, except for maybe Hanna. They toned down Aria's quirkiness, changed Emily's race (she's a freckly Irish girl in the books), and darkened Spencer's hair (I think she was a blonde in the book, but I've already forgotten). The characters also have more siblings in the books. Who knew that Emily had a sister who was also a swimmer? I kind of want to keep reading the series just so I can see what else has changed.<br /><br />Of course, the biggest change is when Ali's disappearance happened. In the TV show, it had only been a year since she went missing. In the book, it's been 4 years. They were just out of 7th grade when it happened. It really makes the distance between the 4 girls make more sense if it happened over the course of 4 years instead of just one year.<br /><br />Now, I know this is a young adult book. Target demographic is teenage girls. Clearly. But while I normally like YA literature, this one felt a bit... fake, or too commercial, or something. Commercial in that not a page went by without some sort of brand mention. It was a clothing label, or the kind of water they were drinking, or the car they were driving. It got tiring after a while. I can tell that I'm not used to reading books that rely so heavily on brand recognition for description. I know that part of it is to show how affulent these characters' families are, and to emphasise the wealthy neighborhood where they live. But I get it. It was just too much.<br /><br />(Originally posted at goodreads.com)
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|I caught this on cable one night and fell in love with it an thought my little one would love it and that was an understatement. I had it recorded for a long long long time and finally got tired of having to search through all of the recorded shows to get to it because it was one of 3 favorite shows loved and could never get there fast enough for my kiddo. &#34;Mommy Pan - Pan mommy Pan Pan Pan...&#34; Heehee.  My little one, after a billion times of watching this show, still is memorized by this version of Peter Pan and wrinkles nose at other versions. It's funny to see such a reaction from a youngster. Possibly a movie critic in the making...  Anyway - I highly recommend this show for all children, adults, and family's. Enjoy!
B008JFUPK8|2.0|With the sheer dozens of Superhero films being thrown at us in the past years, starting with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, another iteration of Superman was just a matter of time, especially considering Brian Singer's Superman Returns was anything but a success, both financially and artistically. So, there was definitely a considerable audience for Man Of Steel, one that was longing for a proper Superman movie. At the same time, though, with all the superhero franchises out there that have already been successful, and already have satisfied many needs for great comic book adaptions, you really have to knock one out of the park to be considered in the same league as Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man or The Avengers. Especially since the Superman origin story already was told a few years ago. With Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder, whose Watchmen was a good piece of film making, one would think the right people were in place.<br /><br />So, does it hold up? In a word, no.<br />If you want to save yourself the hassle of reading this lengthy review to its bitter end, let me sum it up for you quickly: Man Of Steel is the result of taking Superman The Movie and Superman 2, making the lead actor seem uncharismatic, removing the sense for delight and adventure, replacing the poignant dialogue with pseudo-drama, and unleashing ridiculously long Transformers-like CGI action sequences upon the unsuspecting audience.<br />Condensing this down even further, I would pick three words to describe this film: stupid, tedious and superficial. \\"Stupid\\" sounds, well, stupid, but is in its simplicity a great word to describe the intangible feeling hanging over this entire thing.<br />The prologue already alienated me from the entire Superman universe. It looks like a combo of a George Lucas directed Star Wars prequel and Transformers, complete with silly flying pteranodons. In the council scenes, I almost expected Yoda to come forth and say \\"Evacuate Krypton, we will not!\\" Had this prologue not keyscenes of the Superman mythology, you would surely mistake it for a second-grade sci-fi flick.<br />The CGI mumbo-jumbo goes completely over board here (and later on), and showcases perfectly the difference between well-designed thought through sets, and the misleading notion \\"more and bigger is better\\". It is quite the achievement on part of the design team to make a 2013 movie look more ridiculous than Superman The Movie from 30 years ago. I usually don't nitpick on things like this, but when Zod and his accomplices were taken into the Phantom Zone in what looked exactly like big black rubber penises, I sunk just a tiny bit lower in my seat.<br />The story is nothing revolutionary, but I lost complete faith in the credibility of the film when it was revealed that Jor-El hid the DNA of every single Kryptonian in Superman's cells. That's when I knew someone on this project had to have lost his mind.<br /><br />There was some doubt and fear that Christopher Nolan's involvement could mean a Dark Knight treatment for a character that is, and should be, arguably almost the polar opposite of Batman in tone. And gues what? These fears were justified. No movie to this day managed to suck the life and heart out of a superhero as thoroughly as Man Of Steel.<br /><br />What makes this movie so absolutely tiresome is two things: the story, which is atrociously told, and the action sequences that are overlong and tedious in their visual and sonic overkill.<br />You have here the origin story of Superman, which has already been told twice before. You would think that, as a film maker, you want to really make it work, you want to make it exciting and fresh, with good dialogue and so on. Instead, what we have here is a Clark Kent/Superman that could as well be Bruce Wayne, or Peter Parker, with all the incessant self-doubts and thoughtful and sorrowful looks. It is truly annoying and frustrating, not to mention overdone, that producers/directors of superhero flicks apparently think lots of superficial drama and a hero with self-doubts and worried eyes can replace a well-written story and well-portrayed and fleshed out characters.<br />If these inner conflicts were at least portrayed well and believable, but they are not. It works on a very basic level, but everything beyond appears to be just pure superficial drama. And this is simply due to the fact that Superman/Clark Kent is not, and never was, such a deeply troubled individual such as Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker. The whole world knows it, and you simply don't buy it.<br />Ironically, when the writer/director does have the opportunity to create something worthwhile and heartfelt, it feels half-assed and rushed, like the exposition of his space capsule to young Clark.<br />Looking at Man Of Steel, it doesn't get any more superficial, especially in the last hour of the movie, where basically nothing happens except loads of explosions and CGI wizardry. There is no sense of heroism in this film, no sense of adventure or romance, just superficial drama and mind-numbing action sequences. If you want to know how bad it is, let me just say that the film makers managed to suck the life out of the characters and the story to such an extent that the first kiss between Superman and Lois Lane, probably one of the most iconic love couples in cinema, feels wierd and out of place. Speaking of Lois Lane, Amy Adams does her best, but falls victim to the overused marketing ploy of squeezing a female character into the story, or in this case taking an existing character and blowing it out of proportions, in order to capture female demographics. Not to mention that the decision to make her meet Clark and his superpowers early on is one of the worse decisions in this film.<br /><br />Indeed, one could rightfully say that out of all the major superhero films in the last 10 years, Man Of Steel is the one that comes closest to compromising the entire heart and soul of its title character. Superman Returns was way more enjoyable than Man Of Steel, on many levels.<br />Just as an example, Superman Returns had a focus, and you knew what the film makers were trying to do, and they did it, no matter how clumsily you think they did it. But in Man Of Steel, there is literally not a single thing the movie focuses on for a prolonged time except that Zod wants to turn earth into Krypton. There is a lot of jammering about finding your place, finding yourself, finding destiny, but there is no effort done by the writers or the director to show me, the audience, how the main character develops. That feeling of development is never there, so I stopped caring halfway through.<br />It also doesn't help the entertainment value of the film that the producers decided to turn this into an alien invasion movie, when alien invasion movies seem to reproduce themselves like rabbits these days.<br /><br />The picture also has enormous pacing problems. From the very first scenes on, you get the impression nobody did a test screening, not even for the director.<br />Man Of Steel is in its first half extremely slow and tedious because of the uninteresting dialogues and bad chracterisations, to the point were the ongoing flashbacks stop the movie dead in its tracks, and in its second half, it is just mind-numbing in its over the top action, which almost reaches Transformers' level of absurdity, albeit thankfully without the pre-school humour. Speaking of humour, it doesn't exist in this film. I don't know, maybe Snyder and Nolan talk about their own director's cut when they speak of the fun aspects of this film, but the cut that was shown at my theatre didn't have any of that. Instead, everything is teinted with this aforementioned, theatrical drama, which puts an enormous distance between the film and the audience.<br />To make clear how bad this movie needs some light moments and good-natured dialogue, the only time I genuinely smiled in this movie was at the very end, when a young female soldier made a remark about Superman being hot. Can you imagine how dry this film is sucked from everything fun when the only laugh it gets comes from an unoriginal sex joke?<br /><br />A major factor in this exhausting film experience that is Man Of Steel is one trick p(h)ony Hans Zimmer, who is so subtle in his approach that he hammers away huge minor harmonies every 3 minutes, to signify this is most epic thing we have seen since, well, since three minutes ago. His music not only severely lacks understanding for the subject, it also lacks the ability to feel, embrace or enhance cinematic pace, or indeed on screen action, and fails to infuse the movie with anything except horribly overbearing melodrama, stone old synth sounds and repeating drum loops around every corner. While this is certainly true of many of Zimmer's scores, I feel with Man Of Steel, he has reached the absolute peak. In my wildest nightmares I didn't imagine Superman flying to hammy \\"High Noon at Daisy Town\\" guitar figures and fake sounding drum loops. If you look at scenes like Kal-El's capsule flying to earth or his first appearance in his suit, and imagine Williams' music, you should break out in tears.<br />The score wanders through Zimmer's opus like a \\"Best of 2000s\\" album: from DaVinci Code over Dark Knight all the way to \\"Mermaids\\" from Pirates 4, all quoted near verbatim.<br />This is lazily conceived, badly spotted, worse orchestrated, mind-numbingly mixed wallpaper that also happens to be laughably simplistic in composition and absolutely interchangable in style. I won't even begin to discuss the lack of anything remotely resembling heroism, which is inherent in the Superman character, no matter how hard Snyder and Nolan try to remove it.<br />Man Of Steel has some of the worst mismatches between picture and music I have ever seen. And you don't have to compare it to John Williams to realise this.<br /><br />Man of Steel, all together, is creepily reminiscent of Matrix Revolutions. A saviour isforced to accept his role and deal with his powers in a different world, a lot of pseudo-deep stuff is thrown in seemingly randomly and doesn't come together in the end, there are silly, gigantic robots fighting in overlong sequences, the female protagonist tries to destroy the hero's doubts and drives him forward, and at the end, the two main antagonists have a cartoony fight between rooftops - two gods pitched against each other. You even have Laurence Fishburn in a wise-cracking role and Harry Lennix in the exact same role as the iron balls, asshole commander. To be fair though, Matrix Revolutions had good music.<br />The acting is thoroughly competent, even though it is terribly sad to watch so much talent being wasted in such a mundane movie. It is especially bad for Henry Cavill, who makes for a great Superman, or would make for a great one were he not asked to constantly act like he forgot to take his anti-depression medication, and forced to wear a dull costume better suited for Bizarro than Superman.<br /><br />The biggest sin of all however is that Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder failed to make Man Of Steel unique and recognisable. It is a copy of The Dark Knight and Spider-Man at the best, and just another noisy sci-fi flick at the worst of times. I want to watch this film again as much as I want to hear the soundtrack album for a second time.<br />As much as I love Superman, this movie barely makes it to the 2 out of 5 stars mark.
B005UG542S|5.0|As with all the other Harry Potter movies, I loved it! I am just sorry this is the last in the series
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I chose this rating because I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I am a fan of Hosseini and have read his other works. The complexity of his stories is amazing. His works are moving and make you feel a myriad of emotions. I would highly recommend this novel as a must read if you are a fan and if not, you will be.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought it to save money from the expensive accessories the Uppababy requires and it does the job!<br />I wouldn't put a hot beverage in it, but for everything else, it's a good fit! And it has a little and convenient pocket with zipper inside.<br />Good product!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is more about using your brain to try to figure out what you are doing and how to get out of the room you are in.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My girls are having a lot of fun with this.  They suggest you add freckles to the option list.  I think it's funny that you can remove their pimples.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed reading this a lot- but sense it would have been more fun in installments as originally intended as I started to lose interest at points. I have played the fallout video games and couldn't help using them as a basis for how I pictured the silos. Keep up the good work.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|Have seen this movie multiple times now and it doesn't seem to get old.<br /><br />Yes, there may be some humor for older kids and plenty of fart jokes, but life goes on.<br /><br />It's good enough that adults don't have to leave the room.<br /><br />http://www.kids-in-mind.com/r/robots.htm<br /><br />&#34;3 scatological terms (3 mild references to flatulence and feces), 4 mild anatomical terms (keester, butt, tuchus), 1 implied anatomical term, a robot says &#34;Grow some bolts,&#34; 3 mild obscenities (screwed, heck, dang), insults and name-calling (idiot, stupid, moron).&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first 2 books hooked me, mocking jay both saddened me and angered me. While the irony wasnt lost on me, I did not like the direction Collins took here and I feel betrayed by her. Without revealing too much about the ending, I will just say that I was drawn into the series and &#34;fell in love&#34; with many of the characters, only to be left heartbroken.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was perfect, it was real and it was sad and it was amazing. I knew it was going to be sad the entire time yet it was still sweet and won you over from the start. I would recommend this to any girl in middle school or high school, great read that kept me hooked and ended with me in tears.

B002XHNMVM|5.0|Loved this book! It is inspirational and a wake up call that it is never too late to find your element, the spot where you get more energy instead of spending it… Don't miss out on the after words as well.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in many years. I loved The Kite Runner and 1000 Splendid Suns but in my opinion this book outdid both. The writing was hauntingly beautiful and the characters' separate plots blend together in an incredibly artistic way. I was in tears at the end, and I couldn't explain why.
0525478817|5.0|** This review, as well as many more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) **<br /><br />My Thoughts: This is a book that I noticed months ago while perusing the aisles at my local Chapters and it was put on my 'TBR (To Be Read) List' immediately.  It's gotten a lot of hype (which may or may not be the kiss of death for a book).  In this case the hype is warranted.<br /><br />This was a touching read.  Even though you know it's going to be a sad book (it deals with teenagers with cancer-ravaged bodies) and will, most likely, deal with death it doesn't detract from enjoying this book.  You'd think that a book that focuses on a group of teens with cancer would be a huge tear fest from beginning to end but for the most part this book was funny and, in a strange way, uplifting and oh so very touching.  Yes, it's a veritable roller coaster of emotions.  But it works.<br /><br />For me, what makes this book stand out are the characters.  Not only are Hazel and Augustus well-rounded and completely engaging characters but the secondary characters, including Isaac and the sets of parents, are all complete and give believable voices to the book.  It's these characters and their relationships with each other that truly shine in this book.<br /><br />Let's get back to Hazel and Augustus.  I loved Hazel from the first line of the book.  Her dry wit,<br />sarcasm and humour.  Loved her.  Augustus held his own too and I adored their hilarious banter.  He had some amazing lines in the book that I immediately wrote down because they were just 'that good'.  Here's some of my favs ...<br /><br />\\"Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a<br />privilege to have my heart broken by you.\\"<br /><br />\\"But, while not all stories have happy endings,<br />it doesn't make their journey any less beautiful.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's the thing about pain... It demands to be felt.\\"<br /><br />\\"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities\\"<br /><br />\\"I love you present tense\\"<br /><br />Some would argue that 'normal teenagers' don't speak like Hazel and Augustus.  I know that I didn't sound quite so cool at that age but, man, would I loved to have been!  I will admit that they had a certain \\"Dawson's Creek/more mature than their years\\" way of speaking.  But, I loved their sarcasm and just their voices in general. {I'm actually a little surprised and impressed at how well John Green got into the head of a teenage girl.}<br /><br />Hazel, Augustus (and even Isaac) were believable even if how they said what they said was a little mature for them.  Plus, these aren't normal teens.  These are kids who have dealt with cancer and the threat of death for YEARS.  Honestly, I found Hazel and Augustus to have a more quirky feel to them than being too unbelievably mature for their age.  These teens, after years of treatments, losing friends to the disease that they themselves have, trying to stay strong for their families and friends ... have accepted their fates.  They have cancer.  Cancer SUCKS but their cancers don't define or limit who they are.  They still have life to live.  That's empowering and uplifting.<br /><br />One of the things that I liked was getting an inside view into the life of a teen with cancer.  Hazel was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer at the age of 13.  Since then she knows that death is hovering over her but with the help of a miracle drug she has been able to lead a pretty normal life (even though she has to lug an oxygen tank around with her for when her lungs suck at being lungs).  Hazel knows she's living on borrowed time and she hates feeling like an emotional grenade so she tries as hard as possible to minimize the emotional shrapnel that she'll cause her friends and family when she finally dies.  Hazel is hunkering down for the inevitable ... until she meets Augustus.<br /><br />The one and only thing that I felt detracted from me giving this a full on \\"5 star review\\" was the addition ofthe book storyline (a book that Hazel and Augustus are infatuated with).  It broke away from their relationship and, I feel, bogged down the storyline too. It may also stem from the fact that I just didn't 'get' the book.<br /><br />This is a book about the strength of the human spirit, the bravery and resilience of a bunch of teens who were dealt a really tough lot in life.  It shows the nastiness of cancer and the strength we gain from connecting with others.  It reminds us that we can still make a huge impact on the lives of our loved ones even if we may not be around long enough to make an impact on the world at large.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the book that sums up how I feel about this book:<br /><br />\\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep.  Slowly.  Then all at once.\\"<br /><br />Oh yes.  This book got to me slowly and totally captivated me before I knew what was coming.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />My Rating: 4.5/5 starsthe book storyline (a book that Hazel and Augustus are infatuated with).

B0031RS44S|5.0|Reacher is always a character to keep you reading. It leaves me coming back for more and I would recommend it to any reacher fans.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Awesome game with really creative methods yo obtain keys to get out of the room. Only twice have I had to use cheats to clear the level and it was necessary because the way to get the key or item was very hard. But very good for people wanting a casual and inventive game to pass the time with.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I didn't agree with everything in the book, but I did agree with the basic principals and have tried to apply them in my life.
159463176X|5.0|I thought \\"The Kite Runner\\" was one of the best & most compelling books I'd read in years, but was deeply disappointed in those expectations for \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\"  While no doubt accurate, the portrayal of the cultural treatment of women in Thousand Suns was so depressing and hopeless that I couldn't enjoy the book.  With \\"And the Mountains Echoed,\\" Hosseini redeemed himself in my eyes. He regained his loving voice for his home, country and family, capturing for us all the deeply ingrained love for those cornerstones of life.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|My whole family loves this game, from my wife to my 2 year old I hardly have time to play myself. The game runs great on our kindle and we recommend it to everyone who enjoys tower defense games!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Enlightening. While a disturbing book to read I am glad I did read it after seeing the boy interviewed on 60 minutes.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Interesting book.  A bit unnerving.  Reminds me a little of Scott Turow's writing in Presumed Innocent or the old movie The Bad Seed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 8 yr old son had SO much fun playing this for the past few months that I had to start my OWN game and join the fun!!!

B0028KF4M4|4.0|I didn't know where they were going with season 3, but after the first couple episodes, I was hooked again.
B00915G6YE|4.0|Not as good as seasons 3, 4 and 5 in my opinion, but better than 6.  And as always the ending keeps you wondering until next season.

B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk always delivers excellent quality music. The best part is the ability to download the music before you get the physical copy. A good purchase!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sheryl documents clearly with great organization the components behind the gap in female leadership and the work from all segments of the personal and professional workforce that need to step forward to improve the options for everyone.<br /><br />Yes at times I do feel that there are quite a few names and statistics between stories, but at the core of this is a woman who wants great freedom for everyone, regardless of the choice of the individual female. It was well distributed between notes for the young professional, the new mother, the family woman, the high-performance executive, and for women who have yet to make any of those decisions in their lives.<br /><br />Definitely a book not to be judged until read.<br />Best quote that relates to this book &#34;there is a special place in hell for women who don't help other women.&#34; Sheryl's book is a great step in trying to support all women to raise the bar for themselves and for the generations to follow them.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I read these books growing up and I absolutely love them. Then and now, to this day, they never get old. Hope to read them all with my kids one day!

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A beautifully written book, addressing the complexities of relationships, memory and its impact. What are acceptable societal norms to some and not to others is also reflected well.The writer cleverly weaves characters and periods in their lives into the story line, crafted in a way that one can easily jump from one character to another and one period to another. I look forward to the next book by Hosseini.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game it really challenges your brain. I hope guys enjoy it as much as I did. Can you escape?
B009QU9X44|5.0|Another masterpiece by Adichie who addresses issues of race and identity in such an interesting way. I can't wait for her next novel.
B000NDMRCS|4.0|Like it. Had an old DVD copy and updated to Blu-Ray, big difference. If you haven't seen it, I would recommend<br />buying it or renting it.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|i just could not get into this game but thats just my opinion if you can try it for free i would give it a shot.
0425263991|4.0|Review Courtesy of All Things Urban FAntasy<br /><br />HEART OF OBSIDIAN was an emotionally charged and intensely brilliant story that had me staying up long into the night to finish it. In this book we see the impact of the slowly breaking self- imposed Silence on the Psy race with violent reactions to change and struggles for freedom by the Pure-Psy faction. The complexity of this world is always a joy to delve into and in HEART OF OBSIDIAN we see that the political climate along with the lives of the Psy race is extremely perilous.  While this very bloody struggle between the Psy (as well as Changlings, and Humans) is fascinating, at the heart of HEART OF OBSIDIAN is a love story between two people who are so very broken.<br /><br />Kaleb and Sahara fit together better than most of the other couples featured in the Psy-Changling series due to their shared years of torment at the hands of incredibly sadistic people. Just reading the descriptions of each of their years of torture was devastating and I was very glad when vengeance was met out.  Kaleb was always a character I wanted to know more about and was never sure about his loyalties. Even at the beginning of HEART OF OBSIDIAN I wasn't sure about what he was going to do to Sahara. By the end  I finally got a good handle who this very dangerous, insanely loyal, sexy man stood with this world and with Sahara. Basically, the love story between Kaleb and Sahara is the definition of love and devotion on an almost insane level.<br /><br />HEART OF OBSIDIAN is dark, compelling, and a wonderfully engaging addition to the Psy-Changling series. With the game changing events in this book I am looking forward to seeing the aftermath in the yet to be named 13th Psy-Changling book coming out in 2014..
B00AK57N00|3.0|fun for a while but there are better game out there that are worth the money just an okay game
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The west wing was one of my favorite tv shows and it's great to be able to watch it again.  The issues they covered then----sometimes over ten years ago------are still relevant today.  I also like the nice box it comes in and the clever file folders the discs are stored in and the booklet comes in handy.  The commentaries are very interesting as are the  Special features.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and good graphics. Excellent puzzels that make you think. Easy controls. Hope that more levels come out soon!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great movie!  Good historical research by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Great acting by all.  Really loved Lincoln in the movie theater----had to have it

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. Thought it was going to be beyond me but if one stops and thinks just what clues are given and what moves you do you'll find a fascinating game. Truthfully, was shocked when it was over.Kind of short but for the price and fun factor..totally worth every penny!! Can't wait for another..

B001UGB1X8|1.0|Does anyone know what was going on in this movie? I understand that it was recut and differed from the director's vision but couldn't they have cut the clichés instead?

B000YJ54DU|3.0|At times the book was repetitive and contrived. I do, however, enjoy Lee Child's books and look forward to my next read.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|So much better than anything on TV today. No wonder this series garnered so many awards. WELL written and acted, with great attention paid to the details. Nice having the entire series in one package...and we don't miss the commercials!
B009AMAGQM|4.0|I love the movie and it was delivered within 2 days. I didnt pay for rush shipping either. Fast ive been waiting for this movie to come out for a while. Good job as usual

No complaints at all and can definitely recommend.

So what are you waiting for, buy your FIVE star alarm today!
B002N5N5LG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Community. This DVD is well worth the price. However, if you're new to the show, keep in mind that seasons 2 and 3 are much better than this one.<br /><br />The special features are great, but only diehard fans will want to watch every episode again with commentary.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game enjoy playing love the extras in the game . Play all the time everyday when ever I have a free moments
1609611543|3.0|I saw the Dr Oz show promoting the book and some of the advertisements. The book repeats the authors opinions over and over to the point of making me skim and skip chapters. I tried the program religiously and I felt better ( I do have wheat allergies but not critical) I also cut down on my food and was no longer hungry all the time, but I havent drop one pound of my weight or &#34;wheat belly&#34; I tend to think the author overstates the benefits of his program or perhaps it works for people with critical medical problems.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Well, this book was defiantly an interesting novel. I mean, it was different from all the romance novels that I have read. Every single one of them married for love. And they married for partners. It was such a turn for me. All the characters were awesome and I really enjoyed this novel. And in the end, they married for love. Ah, gives me a warm feeling. Bubbly up inside.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but entertaining and I really enjoyed playing this on my free time so yeah. Great app you should try it for sure
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I haven't, in the past, been a fan of stories that change protagonists and point of view. In fact, it is only recently that this approach to a novel has worked for me (Hugh Howey, in one or more of his [[ASIN:B0092K47MG Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]] books). I loved the way that Arthur C. Clarke used this approach in this book. And, even though some elements of the story and opening to the plot were dated, this book was fascinating and relevant sci-fi for other reasons. The plot was in no way predictable. Some readers found the author's style to be old-school. I didn't experience it that way. PS. I didn't read the new introduction, preferring to experience the story with a fresh and unprejudiced perspective. If you're a fan of sci-fi, I imagine you will love this book. Think #alieninvasion #hightech #surpriseending. Happy reading~*
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|This cd package is worth every single penny - i've been sitting here with a portable cd player putting the original cds in and then the remasters from this Smiths Complete box set - each instrument is much more defined and the recordings as a whole are less muddy.  Morrissey's voice is crisp and clean.  I would order the actual box set since you get all the mp3s for free with Amazon's auto rip deal - its fun to have each individual cd with all the original artwork, brings back all the wonderful high school angst!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am so disappointed that this was not the ending of this book.  It seems that since &#34;FIFTY SHADES OF GREY&#34;, that all of these books are either trilogy or more.  I am seriously tired of this, and will start to wait a while before purchasing a book to see if once again there are multiple books for one story.  SHAME ON YOU MS. DAY for allowing your fans to be treated like this.  SHAME.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I saw this in the theater when it came out, then read the book..then rented it on Amazon prime to watch with my husband.<br />We enjoyed this movie..very cute. The book was good..but surprisingly, the movie was better in my opinion. I liked R in the movie...he was cast very well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game a lot... it's really cute and my 5 year old daughter just loves having her own pony!

B0018OFN1S|5.0|As far as the film itself it resembles &#34;The Road Warrior&#34;. The characters are all archetypes and are anything but subtle. The action scenes are done with loving care; any use of CAG is well enough done that IMHO it is undetectable. Altogether I found the film exciting and enjoyable,<br /><br />'

B004JHYRP4|3.0|It's a very clever idea, and the main plot line is convincing with nice characters.<br />The secondary plot line however is not convincing and ruined the novel for me.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I had seen the movie in the local theater and liked it, so I wanted a copy for my collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The plot continues/flows well from season 1. I enjoy the unexpected twists & turns in the show. The Grandmother's character is awesome - she's so up front, but shows a softer side when faced with difficulty. Each show keeps my attention, no lag in plot & I look forward to each one.
B00BQ83VJM|4.0|I rate The Fifth Witness as one of the better novels by Connelly.  The story is somewhat bland as noted by one reviewer but I still found myself attached to it.  However I cannot shake off one question when the true killer, and the posture the victim was taking when he was hit, were finally reviewed:<br /><br />The victim was hit three times on the head consecutively, and more or less on the same spot.  The autopsy results indicated that the victim died from the first hit.  He must have started falling immediately after that first hit and I cannot imagine the killer could aim at the same spot with the hammer on the second and third hits.  A hammer is not a machine gun.  One needs to take a swing before make a hit.  I find it difficult enough to hit a stationary nail, let alone a moving object.

Created by the hole band, not one outside writer, unlike the other Queensryche/Myth with former singer Vest Tate.<br />What I love about this album is it strength, not a single filler. Love em all. Some complaint about it's length, well I don't. I want quality not quantity.<br />I'm proud to be a Queensryche fan again.<br />Looking forward to the next one.

193700788X|5.0|Thirteenth and the last in the Sookie Stackhouse urban fantasy series revolving around Sookie, a telepath and waitress in a bar.<br /><br />Actually, it's not quite last... After Dead, 13.5, is coming out the end of October 2013. And once you read Dead Ever After, you'll realize that \\"[[ASIN:0425256995 Home Improvement: Undead Edition]]\\", noted as 11.1, is more realistically 13.25.<br /><br />My Take<br />I hesitated to read this story if only because of the diatribes I'd been reading from others, furious at how Harris had ended the series. And it terrified me. My imagination went wild assuming all sorts of horrific scenarios.<br /><br />I have no idea why these people went so nuts. I think Harris ended this beautifully, perfectly.<br /><br />It does have some odd stylistic inclusions that I haven't experienced in this series before. Namely, the start with the unnamed characters that seem to have nothing to do with Sookie until we read further in, only to discover it's all to do with Sookie. All a part of the tidy-up. For that's exactly what Harris is doing. Allowing the major secondary characters to say goodbye, to tell us what's happening in their lives. Clearing up the bad guys and smoothing the way for Sookie's future.<br /><br />Think of it as a curtain call with one of the biggest when so many of Sookie's friends and supporters show up at Sookie's bond hearing in front of Judge Rosoff. Smaller \\"bows\\" come from Aclide and Quinn, Mr. Cataliades and Diantha, Pam is stepping into new shoes, Eric and company's actions which reassure Sookie as to her future choices, and even Sookie's coworkers at the bar help settle the future into an easy peace.<br /><br />It was irritating that Harris kept emphasizing Sam's standoffishness in the first part. Sure, his reasons were good. It's gotta be pretty traumatic. But I think the drama would have been better if Sam had come clean to Sookie and then withdrew again.<br /><br />I'm kinda missing the connection between Sookie's suddenly excessively blooming and fruiting yard with Niall's leaving and closing the door between Faery and our world. Didn't he leave and close things up a few books ago? And only now her yard is going nuts?<br /><br />I'm a little irritated with Sookie in her pushing and pushing at Eric about where she stands with him. No, I do understand her wanting to know, and if she were dealing with another human, I'd be pushing right alongside her. But Sookie knows how unbalanced things are right now with Felipe taking over and wanting to do anything to hurt Eric. Including hurting Sookie. So, why is she pushing so hard?<br /><br />Minor irritations. I am impressed with how content I feel about the end of this series. No, I don't like it ending, but I suspect Harris is ready to move on, just as Sookie is ready for her next move.<br /><br />The Story<br />Sam is lost in the truth of having died. Eric is digging his own grave, metaphorically, yet he does truly love Sookie in his own very pragmatic way. And people from Sookie's past are out for revenge.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Sookie Stackhouseis a telepath and has been excluded from society for it for most of her life. It was only with vampires that she could finally experience something approaching normal. Niall is her fairy great-grandfather. Jason is her happy-go-lucky brother who's also a shifter; he's getting married to Michele. Claude is her fairy cousin who attempted a coup against Niall. And lost. Hunter is Sookie's very young nephew, Hadley's telepathic son who lives with his father, Remy Savoy. Tara is her best friend and married to JB; they have twins. They've just hired Quiana Wong as a babysitter.<br /><br />Technically, she's married, vampire-style, to Eric Northman, the Sheriff of Area Five. The same Eric who is furious with her choice in [[ASIN:0425256383 Deadlocked (Sookie Stackhouse, #12)]]. Pam is Eric's child and second-in-command. Headquarters is Fangtasia. Karin the Slaughterer is another of Eric's children. She'll do anything to protect Eric. Mustapha Khan is a Were and Eric's daytime guy; Warren is his sharpshooting boyfriend.<br /><br />Sam Merlotte owns the bar, well, Sookie is a part owner now, where Sookie waits tables. He's also a shifter able to turn into any animal. They've been friends for years. Bernadette Merlotte is Sam's mom, and she shows up to help.<br /><br />Merlotte's bar staff and customers<br />Kennedy Keyes, the bartender, is with Danny Prideaux (he's Bill's daytime guy and works at a builder's supply), and they're saving up for a house. Antoine is still the cook, and India Unger is one of the barmaids. Holly Cleary is getting married to Hoyt Fortenberry, Jason's best friend. Andrea \\"An\\" Norr is a new hire; she talks a lot, but she's a hard worker. Jane Clementine Bodehouse is a lush who props up a barstool at Merlotte's most nights. She's suing. Marvin is her long-suffering son. Terry Bellefleur is a Vietnam vet who has had a hard time readjusting to civilian life; he works a variety of odd jobs including clean-up at Merlotte's. He met Jimmie over a mutual love of Catahoula dogs.<br /><br />Arlene Fowler, who used to be one of Merlotte's barmaids, is in jail, being held on bail pending her trial in her collusion with the hatemongers who wanted to crucify Sookie. She had been close friends with Sookie and had her babysit her kids, Lisa and Coby, who still want to know why Aunt Sookie hasn't come to see them. The kids are staying with Aunt Chessie while mom's in jail.<br /><br />Alcide Herveaux is the alpha for the werewolf pack in Shreveport; he's seeing Kandace. John Quinn, an events planner, is a weretiger Sookie once dated. Seems his mate, Tijgerin, is doing well in her pregnancy. His sister, Frannie, is doing well also.<br /><br />Bill Compton is Sookie's vampire neighbor and friend across the cemetery. Felipe de Castro is the vampire King of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Nevada. Angie is his girlfriend, and Horst is his second-in-command. Freyda is the vampire Queen of Oklahoma with whom Eric's maker, Appius Livius Ocella, signed a betrothal contract.<br /><br />Desmond Cataliades is a demon lawyer in New Orleans and Sookie's godfather. Diantha is his niece and part fast-talkin' demon. Amelia Broadway, a witch, is a not-quite-so welcome friend of Sookie's; she's got a big mouth and a bad tendency to overshare. She's still with Bob, another witch. Barry Bellboy, a.k.a., Barry Horowitz, the telepath from Texas (see [[ASIN:0441019315 Living Dead in Dallas (Sookie Stackhouse, #2)]]). Delphine Oubre is a touch psychic. I don't understand why no one can tell her their names??<br /><br />The Bon Temps Police Department<br />Detective Andy Bellefleur is Terry's cousin, and he's married to the pregnant Halleigh who is loyal to Sookie. Detective Alcee Beck has a real hard-on to arrest Sookie; Barbara is his wife and the Bon Temps librarian who's terrified. Kevin is behaving like a jerk, Kenya, and Jessie Schneider are fellow cops.<br /><br />Copley Carmichael is Amelia's father; he's in the construction business intending to get rich off the reconstruction of New Orleans after Katrina. Tyrese is a bodyguard who doesn't believe in souls and doesn't think with his head. Gypsy Kidd, a.k.a., Katy Sherboni, is Tyrese's target. Harp Powell is writing a book about Kym Rowe's life. Good luck making it interesting. Beth Osiecki and Jarrell Hilburn are law partners who have done work for Sookie in the past.<br /><br />A devil doing business, collecting souls, paying back debts. The Reverend Steve Newlin is aching for revenge ([[ASIN:0441019315 Living Dead in Dallas (Sookie Stackhouse, #2)]]). Johan Glassport is the ultimate in the worst of lawyers (we first encountered him in [[ASIN:B001L2BDWK All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse, #7)]]).<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is consistent with previous stories with its cartoonish bit of fantasy and is a summary of both this story as well as a fond farewell with the overly blooming garden surrounding the sparkly, fairy-ish Sookie as she heads off into the sunset in her cowboy boots and flirty skirt, looking over her shoulder to say goodbye. Others are popping in to say goodbye as well: the bats flying off, a happy collie, a curl of a tiger's tail, and a smiling wolf.<br /><br />I suspect the title is both Harris' and the series' epitaph, Dead Ever After.Freyda is the vampire Queen of Oklahoma with whom Eric's maker, Appius Livius Ocella, signed a betrothal contract.<br /><br />Desmond Cataliades is a demon lawyer in New Orleans and Sookie's godfather.

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Imagine my surprise, when I sat down to watch this movie with no notion of what it was about (prequel, reboot, sequel, remake?), only to find a delightgfully funny precursor to the events of the classic \\"Wizard of Oz\\". But what's far more surprising is that Raimi has taken this golden opportunity and done something that simply boggles the mind- he has created a companion piece to 1993's low budget cult classic (and Bruce Campbell's most famous movie), \\"Army of Darkness\\". This is utterly hilarious for so many reasons, I don't even know where to begin or how to properly describe the majesty of this elaborate joke.<br /><br />(MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)<br />Raimi duplicates several iconic scenes, which shall not be mentioned here, for fear of major spoilers, though I can safely reveal that some of these involve gunpowder and winged creatures. He even goes so far as to throw in some of the old AOD lines, such as \\"Hold... hold...!\\" during another scene which I cannot detail any further, again for fear of spoilers. Additionally, the stories are remarkably similar, insofar as we have a displaced outsider arriving in a strange land, being hailed as a savior, exposed as a fraud, and then relying on his wits and resourcefulness to lead a ragtag force against an army of overwhelming strength and evil... an army of \\"darkness\\", one might even say. Heck, he even gets Danny Elfman to compose the original score for Oz (the same musician who wrote AOD's brilliant soundtrack), and he sneaks Bruce Campbell into the movie, as a final nod to his old school fans.<br /><br />However, Raimi by no means shorted the Oz fans or its enormous legacy (in my humble opinion, anyway). He did fine justice to the Oz legacy, paying homage to that immortal source, while modernizing it and adding his own, humorous flair. James Franco is perfect as the young, irreverent, charming, and highly flawed Oz, bringing this story to life in a way that is nothing short of magical. Diehard fans of the classic may be disappointed (which is inevitable when tackling such an old, revered piece), but I honestly feel that if you go into this movie with an open mind, an open heart, and a willingness to laugh at all things silly, you will have a wonderful time.disappointed (which is inevitable when tackling such an old, revered piece), but I honestly feel that if you go into this movie with an open mind, an open heart, and a willingness to laugh at all things silly, you will have a wonderful time.
1480535885|5.0|I had no business reading this.  Totally not my style.  I can't even remember why I started the first one.  OMG.  I tore through them all.  Now I'm hunting through all the add ones written by fans.  Which is an amazing concept!  It's beyond cool to read someone else's addition to a well established story.  None of this will make sense until you read it though!
030758836X|4.0|It took me all of five pages to realize I was born around the same time as the author(same year). So that's a good thing, because I got a lot of the inside jokes and references. I was stupid and read the big spoiler beforehand, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the book. I probably would've guessed it anyway; you can see it coming from a mile away (Not bragging, but I did say \\"Is Bruce Willis a ghost?\\" when my friend told me I'd never believe the ending of The Six Sense). So anyway, the second half is where the good stuff really kicks in. It starts to lag and get repetitive near the end of the second act, but that's just building up for the big finale. The big OMG at the end was also viewable from space and not that shocking. By that point, we know who these people are and what they're capable of. So read it and smile if you're happily single, or happily  marri... hee hee. Awww, I almost got that last part out without laughing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easier to riddle through than 100 floors. Better clues and more fun. Like searching the rooms and putting the hints and tools together.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Definitely more detail in the book then the tv show. But also has been right on point with the story. Good to know HBO is sticking to the story.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is one of the funniest books I have ever read!!  Having Drew tell you what he is thinking is hilarious!!

The storyline flowed, I was never bored.

B00AM7E4LM|3.0|The First 20 Hours (2013) by Josh Kaufman is a pretty thin book on learning new skills and learning in general. The book is pretty much an essay extended into a book. Kaufman’s book is about how to obtain the basics of a skill in 20 hours. Kaufman wrote a successful book called The Personal MBA. Kaufman is the self-help guru for the Hacker News set.<br />Kaufman has 10 rules for Rapid Skill Acquisition and ten major principles of effective learning. They include such gems as ‘Research the skill and related topics’ and ‘eliminate distractions in your environment’. Personally I’ve always liked to work on nuclear engineering while under gunfire, but these tips may work for the author. However, some of the tips do have some merit. The idea of giving pretty much anything you decide to take up 20 hours of concentrated effort is worthwhile. Also fast feedback loops, decomposing things are worthwhile. Kaufman also makes the point that you ‘make time’ for something rather than having time.<br />For most of the rest book Kaufman writes up varies activities he has used the approach he describes for. They are doing yoga, altering his web site and writing a web application, learning go, learning the Ukulele and learning to wind surf. It’s pretty clever to write a self-help book and use your diaries of what you are doing as well.<br />The book isn’t worthless but it’s really not up to much. I’ve also learned something valuable, before buying a book check around for some negative reviews if it’s written by an author with a web following.

0618680004|5.0|Wow, this book changed my life. I remember hating on this book when I was brainwashed with Christianity. Okay so this book is from the famous Richard Dawkins, who is no doubt one of the most controversial and respected man in the world. As it said:<br /><br />Dawkins writes that The God Delusion contains four \\"consciousness-raising\\" messages:<br />1. Atheists can be happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.<br />2. Natural selection and similar scientific theories are superior to a \\"God hypothesis\\"--the illusion of intelligent design--in  explaining the living world and the cosmos.<br />3. Children should not be labelled by their parents' religion. Terms like \\"Catholic child\\" or \\"Muslim child\\" should make people cringe.<br />4. Atheists should be proud, not apologetic, because atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins talks about almost EVERYTHING regarding religion(s). He talks about key points and issues from both sides of the argument, but still maintaining firm in his points. A lot of people complain that he is rude and arrogant, while I may say it may come off as that, I wouldn't actually agree with that. In his book, he is passionate, firm, and blunt. You need to think about this for a second. When it comes to religion, followers are blunt and set out in their ways as well. We can't deny the fact that religion has harmed and IS harmful in many ways. So the fact that Mr Dawkins is unapologetic is understood. Note this though, you will need a dictionary and probably will have to study on some things in the book. Because he uses a lot of high vocabulary. Secondly, as you guessed, Science is mentioned a lot in here. So if you are not good in the basics of Science and more (as I, because I never really cared for it till now) you will need to learn more about it.<br /><br />Anyways, that I can say that's the part I didn't like a lot. Also, a part that I was confused and don't really agree with either is that scale hemade in rating how much you believe God exists, to can, to not being sure, then to being 100 percent sure. Google that, it's...nonsense. I mean isn't being an Atheist pretty straight forward? We don't believe in the existence of any higher being. If anything, if you are unsure, wouldn't that make you an Agnostic? I think this just confuses the concept even more. It's not necessary and frustrating.<br /><br />It can be mind bottling sometimes, so you have to read slower to better grasp what he is saying. Aside from that, I loved everything about it. He discusses morality and how Atheists can live a fulfilled life without the great book. Also, I got this right on time and in exact quality as it was described to be. Very happy. If you are religious, read this book anyway - with a warning already about it, and with a open mind. Who knows, it might just help you understand things differently.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|Quite watching after about 15 min.  What a waste of time and money.  No plot, just an old man trying to act young and not doing a very good job of it.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's a very quirky story about a socially-awkward kid name Charlie. It's very cute and not at all what I THOUGHT it was based off the few movie screenshots. Great for teens, not sure if adults would like it as much, it's certainly not appropriate for children. Some drug use, sex, etc. Very good though, definitely recommend!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|omg most of the hair salon apps cost money so that's why I got it. also I love 6677g Ltd apps I have all of them and I'm glad that they are still making more apps! they are awesome! so get this game it might be the only free hair salon app!

1451629184|5.0|I liked the book. The read was easy and it made me cry. I will read it again. thank you.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|This is a really solid effort, I really dig the metallic riffing that reminds me of albums like the warning and the 1st e.p., also some of the moody stuff is kind of like rage for order.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed a cable to charge my Kindle & this one has worked perfectly.  Right when I attached it to the device it started working.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Although Hosseini is a great story teller, this one is too muddled and confusing. The protagonists are not allowed to enter our hearts and souls.
B002XXPNXG|3.0|This is the third (please say &#34;final&#34;) installment of these movies which were started eighteen years ago. It's truly a stage play on the big screen, with a Greek background. Think of a verbose canvas. Entertaining up to a point ... then boring.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|What a great movie! Wonderful acting and the story is something I've never seen in a movie before. This was the second time i watched the movie and could watch it over and over again.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|After hearing this album, it's obvious just how much of an impediment Geoff Tate became to this band's progress. Every song is a winner. Hopefully this is the first of many more great albums to come.
1781162646|5.0|I've been reading Stephen King since one night The Shining was on TV and I begged my Mom to let me watch it. I was only 8 or 9 and while a lot of adults would say bad parenting all I can say is I was always into scary things and my mom knew I could take it after that I had to read the book. Since then I've read just about everything by Stephen King. I've stayed loyal through everything and the past few years I'm pleased to find myself feeling like that little girl again. This book may not have had the scares like The Shining but it made me feel just as good. I think we read to forget about the world and just live in the written world for a while. I would read until I couldn't stay awake. I would drift off reading the same line over and over because I couldn't put the book down. It was refreshing to read an actual book for a change too. This book kept me guessing until the end and I'm good at figuring things out. I cried, laughed, and even had the hairs on my skin stand straight up. I was sad when I read the last line because now I have to wait for his next book. Thank you Stephen for writing all these years and staying at the top of your game. I refuse to listen to the critics because for as many books as Stephen has written most are good if not great. How many authors can write like he can. Coming up with different things. Writing is like music everyone has a style and to be so vast is amazing if not inspiring. Please keep writing and I'll keep reading. And thank you for making me feel like that little girl for awhile! You Stephen King are on my bucket list. I've been to the Stanley Hotel and one day I hope to have my copy of The Shining signed by you.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|They both got what they wanted, he taught her things she did not know, he had the best of his last part of life.  You thought they would get together, but, he didn't want to live like this, you wanted them to stay together.  What would you do?  Never read anything like this before.  Excellent.
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|When will the record companies realize they're ruining the sound of music by recording cd's way too loud.  Go to this website to understand what I'm talking about. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ]  This is a great collection of songs from Stills, but as has been the case for well over 10 years now, the dynamic range stinks.  If the sound was better I'd certainly give this 5 stars, but it is not.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|A compelling and important book about the multiple perspectives and muddy ethical waters of being and knowing someone who stands out.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The blu-ray version of the Next Generation is worth it in my opinion, as there are many enhancements.  I have the complete series on DVD to compare it against.  Great for any Trekie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can hardly put this book down, and I'll definitely be reading the next set in the sequence. A great book with action, character depth, and some important themes.
B008133MDK|5.0|Love it! Surprise modern day setting. Guy Ritchie meets Sir Doyle himself. This series will infect you!  Each season consists of 3 episodes 1.5 hours long. I anxiously await season 3.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book really held my interest through the entire read. Jon Grisham did it again. I highly recommend this book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|For any who have seen the movie but not read the book, you are missing out on a far richer and thought-provoking experience. Do not expect loads of descriptions of fights with zombies. There are some, but what makes this book great is its considerations of human interactions, politics, personal change, and total environmental impact that would take place in a world dominated by a global zombie outbreak.

B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|I have several recordings of Norma, and to date my favorite Normas have been Maria Callas and Montserat Caballe, but I love this recording.  I like the idea of the darker voice for Norma with the lighter sweeter voice for the newer mistress, Adalgisa.  I think it works wonderfully well, but I am not sure that other duos could bring this off.  The male singers are not bad, but I think the divas take the honours in this recording.  BRAVISSIME!!!
B00B5JBZGS|4.0|I have a son who's been a guitarist for many years in a hardcore band; I've heard more different CDs from different bands than I can count; after awhile they all sound about the same.  So it was that I approached Disarm the Descent with a healthy dose of skepticism, and expectations that weren't too high.<br />Boy was I surprised!  I really, really want to like this CD very much.  It has everything:  Great musicians who are masters of their respective crafts; interesting, creative melodic hooks and lyrics; a superb lead guitar player whose solos are worthy of study and emulation (I can imagine a guitar professor at a school like Berklee College of Music assigning the solo in \\"Time Will Not Remain\\" for transcription and reproduction, it's that good!); and strong, exceptionally beautiful (can you use that word when reviewing a hardcore band?) vocals and harmonies.  These guys know their stuff, and they deliver.<br />No need here to review each of the cuts, when others have done it so well and competently.  I have just one observation:  Lose the growls, screams, vomit noises all.  This adds nothing whatsoever to what is otherwise one of the best albums I've heard recently.  It detracts from the songwriting and performing skills of the band.  I can understand--and to a certain extent, enjoy--the gutteral growls of death metal (even with prog groups like Opeth), or the demonic high-pitched wails and screams of black metal (Emperor, Wolves in the Throne Room, and some cuts from Agalloch come to mind).  But with a group like Killswitch Engage, very much cut in the mold of Between the Buried and Me, the clean vox are by far the most important.  (I don't care for the screams and raspy vocals in BTBAM either!  They are possibly the most important American band of the 21st century, but the dirty vocals detract from that status.)  So also the dirty vocals in Disarm the Descent detract from what is otherwise a superb album.<br />I know I'm in the minority here.  I've been a working musician my entire life, and no doubt I bring my own aesthetic to my criticisms.  All I can say is this:  When Killswitch Engage is in full flight, all musicians locked in, clean vox on the ascendancy, I am in musical heaven.  But then a rasp or scream intrudes and I am suddenly, painfully grounded again.  This is one man's criticism of what is otherwise a great band, which has produced a great album.<br />So think about it:  Killswitch Engage could be so much more with one small change:  LOSE THE DIRTY VOX!ing musician my entire life, and no doubt I bring my own aesthetic to my criticisms.  All I can say is this:  When Killswitch Engage is in full flight, all musicians locked in, clean vox on the ascendancy, I am in musical heaven.  But then a rasp or scream intrudes and I am suddenly, painfully grounded again.  This is one man's criticism of what is otherwise a great band, which has produced a great album.<br />So think about it:  Killswitch Engage could be so much more with one small change:  LOSE THE DIRTY VOX!

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow what a whirlwind of emotions! I was crying then laughing then crying again. I was sucked into this emotional story about life and it's sometimes bad handouts. How you have to push on through the hard times and when you do that it teaches you to truly value the good! The present is a present so cherish it!!
B0095P3ULC|4.0|This is a good sequel to the original movie. The movie is definitely worth watching but I'm not sure I would buy it.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Heartthrob is the awesome new album from Canadian twins Tegan and Sara that mixes their heartfelt lyrics with killer vocal arrangements and some really amazing electronic production techniques. Production was mainly handled by Greg Kurstin who has had major success with Kelly Clarkson and Pink and he is clearly the driving force behind the polished sound on this album. Highlights include the very catchy opening track \\"Closer\\", the emotional chorus of \\"Goodbye, Goodbye\\", the epic build up of \\"I Was A Fool\\" which sounds like it has a very strong Roxette influence, the upbeat groove of \\"Drove Me Wild\\", the driving chorus of \\"How Come You Don't Want Me\\", and the emotional lyrics of \\"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\\" that describes a regretful lost love. At just under forty minutes, Heartthrob is a very tight album full of great songs and memorable vocal melodies that always ends too soon after each listen. Some fans might not warm to the big shift in heavy production but it really does feel like these songs have been enhanced and made bigger than they were initially intended. Heartthrob is highly recommended to fans of bands such as Roxette and Secondhand Serenade and anyone that loves their music laced with glossy production. By the way, I was lucky enough to see this album performed by Tegan and Sara with their great band recently at The Sydney Opera House and it was brilliant.
B002RI9UBS|2.0|just didn't get into it - was rated well but not my cup of tea - I was disappointed because was impressed with the reviews
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|A pretty good twist on this classic dairy tale, where Jack is sent to the market and comes home with magic beans.  And the rest is a new adventure.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|heard good things about this show.  after watching this season, it forced me to get the 2nd and 3rd seasons.  This show is great!!!
B0002XMKYE|5.0|Have seen the movie many times and always enjoy it.<br />Have it on vhs but wanted to have it on dvd.<br />Very happy with the quality .<br />Thank you very much.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My daughter is 2 1/2 yrs old and loves LOVES princesses. She simply loved all the princesses in this and the little gems that come with it to decorate her wall.<br /><br />My only thing was I wish I had gotten two but we got a princess poster with couple of her Disney movies to help with the space on her walls. Over all great for the lil girl that loves princesses.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|... I will never spend money on apps in the Amazon Appstore. There is no sensible way to handle updates when Google insists on trying to &quot;upgrade&quot; you to the free version of a paid and supposedly premium app. I don't care whose fault the situation is any more, I'm just tired of the whole thing.<br /><br />If it weren't for the free app of the day I'd have uninstalled the Appstore a long time ago.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Worked all floors.  Need more difficulty. Escaped all. Easy puzzles. Great pastime when nothing else to do. Really Needs more levels.  Fun
B002QYUV5M|5.0|If you love RDJr, you will love this. Val Kilmer is also hilarious and the two play off each other very well.<br />I have seen this twice and laughed just as hard the second time.<br />I've now purchased the movie and will be viewing it again this week as a friend who loves RDJr has never heard of it. She's in for a treat!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This show is funny, silly and not to be taken to seriously-but the characters are endearing and found it to be a very a pleasant balance of science and non-science!!! I thought I wouldn't like it so if you are on the fence give it a try!!!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I am 34 weeks pregnant and this movie was just the thing I needed. It was very funny and had many things that happened to the women that I myself have gone through during this pregnancy. It was a great movie and I recommend it for anyone who needs a laugh and needs something to quell the scariness of pregnancy and see the joy of it too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett's research of history is amazing. The crueltyof the Nazis and Stalin's regime is hard to fathom, but what I have read about it it is not oversensationalized in Winter of the World. I have at times learned mre form Follette's books than I have from non-fiction books about society leading up to and into the war. I look forward to the third book of the trilogy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Kept my interest which is a bit hard to do....levels are fun and challenging.  kept A must have for your puzzle collection. Kept me excited!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. The dynamics are marvelous.  I can't wait to see this season.  Like Upstairs Downstairs.  BBC does it the best!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game will give you hours of fun for one dollar. Some people think just because you are trying to eradicate the planet with a deadly plague that the game in bad, but this game is extremely fun and addicting. All of the genes in the game can be purchased, or unlocked simply be playing. In my opinion the best game for a long trip or to relax after a long day.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Found it enjoyable over all. A little slow at parts, but most origin movies are. Not for very young children who are easily frightened.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this game is very fun i am still playing it now i would recommend this game to all of my friends
B000OCXIDK|4.0|I'll be honest...I'm not really sure how to rate this book.  I read it as part of a book club and it's not something I would usually read.  It was...interesting.  I liked the first party narrative but never really connected with the characters.  I didn't understand Griet's decisions, but I enjoyed reading a different perspective than I might have taken.  Overall, I am glad I read it.
B008MM9630|1.0|very much disliked this game and would not recommend this to anyone. the only thing that you can do on this game is plant fruit and fly
B0042U94UQ|4.0|At first glance, having a cartoon with a bad guy for a protagonist doesn't sound like a movie you want to show your child; but this really works.  Steve Carell is unique in this film; that is to say he does a wonderful job playing his character and not making the character Steve Carell.  Of course, our baddie is not that bad, and neither are his opponents, his antagonists.  There is plenty of humor, both situational and slapstick.  Our protagonist believes using 3 young orphans can help him in his latest crime, which is only to steal the moon.  Note that this isn't something related to real life like a bank and it has no real victim, thus indicating that our protagonist isn't an evil example for our youngsters to follow.  None of the situations he places himself, or even his unintended accomplices, have much real danger.  He even has cute adorable comic-relief &#34;minions.&#34;  Our protagonist balances well between following his dream of criminal activity and not really being evil eventually having a change of heart.  I wholeheartedly recommend this movie for children of all ages.  It is a good story of reluctant redemption and emerging heroism well done in a comedic form.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is terrific and to me there really isn't any flaws, and I love the fact that you get to name your own horse and you don't have to stick to the normal boring one that they gave you
B005544TRQ|5.0|I Love this show!  It is so addicting and keeps me up late at night to watch &#34;just one more&#34; episode!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book should be required reading for all high schoolers.  The team's sacrifices and courage were unbelievable.  Fast paced reading!!!
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|If cheesy was what they were going for, then there needs to be more of it. The story doesn't really draw you in, and there is no depth to the characters. If you want to still see it, try to find it on red box so you only waste a dollar, not four or five...
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I had high expectations since I loved Gone Girl but found this one to be too dark and disturbing.  Just okay.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|There has been a lot to talk about in the past 12 months when it comes to the band Queensryche, especially when there are currently TWO versions of this band.  The former frontman released an album under the Queensryche label in April, and now the remaining original members of the band (Rockenfield, Wilton, and Jackson) have released this self-titled album with long-time guitarist Parker Lundgren and new frontman Todd La Torre.  As with the release in April, my main expectation was an album bearing the Queensryche label actually sounding like the Queensryche I grew up with (EP through Promised Land).  I am very happy to say that this album, simply entitled \\"Queensryche\\", does that and so much more.  Some have knocked the band for this, claiming that this album sounds \\"dated\\" or like \\"cliche 80s metal\\".  Yes, it absolutely sounds like Queensryche from the 80s and early 90s, but what is wrong with that?  I love it when a band grows or evolves stylistically, but there is only so far you can go before you alienate your fans.  Would you rather they go all out commercial like a Nickleback?  Try a Nu-Metal vibe like Disturbed?  Did you expect them to add a DJ and scratching ala Korn???  They are back to playing what they love and, while it definitely has that classic vibe, it also sounds extremely modern and relevant.  I received my pre-ordered copy last week, so I've had a lot of time to really let this album soak in.<br /><br />First of all, the band made a very smart move when they brought back Jimbo Barton to produce/mix this album.  Having produced/engineered such classic albums as Operation:Mindcrime, Empire, and Promised Land, it is safe to say that Jimbo knows what the \\"Classic\\" Queensryche sound is, and he captures it beautifully on this release.  This album sounds like it could have been the follow-up to Empire or Promised Land.  While a lot of that is because of how Barton produces and mixes the performances, and knows how to get the most of the musicians, enough can not be said about the performances themselves.  Each member of the band shines in their own way throughout this release, and Barton highlights all of these individual achievements.  Scott Rockenfield hasn't been able to flex his drumming skills like this in almost 20 years.  His playing on this album is so diverse and dynamic that I find myself hearing something new with every listen.  EdBass's tone rolls off in such a menacing way that, when played at the right volume in your car, I guarantee that it will  throw out just enuff extra thrust to add 5-10mpg to your car's efficiency.  And Whip and Parker mesh into one, powerful and dynamic guitar duo, bringing back those long-missed harmonies that were a signature of Queensryche in their heyday.  Some have claimed that this album puts the \\"Metal\\" back in Queensryche.  While that may be a little bit true, this album does way more than that.  This album comes full-circle back to what made them so special to begin with.<br /><br />Classic Queensryche was not metal.  It wasn't rock, prog, alternative, industrial, or pop.  Classic Queensryche was a melting pot of all of these genres and actually defined its own genre; it was quite simply Queensryche.  Tracks like \\"Spore\\", \\"Fallout\\", and \\"Vindication\\" are sure to give you your metal fix, while other tracks like \\"Redemption\\", \\"In This Light\\", and \\"Where Dreams Go To Die\\" are more melodic and commercial in the vein of the Empire album.  \\"Midnight Lullaby/A World Without\\" stands out as one of the darkest and moodiest Queensryche songs to date, complete with a special guest appearance by long-time friend of the band, Pamela Moore (\\"Mary\\" on OMC and OMCII).  And for the first time in a VERY long time, EVERY member of the band is completely involved in the writing process throughout; this is truly a band effort.  One of the standout tracks, \\"Where Dreams Go To Die\\", is the first Queensryche song penned by guitarist Parker Lundgren, and it is amazing how someone so young cancompletely capture the essence of Queensryche.  The band claims to already be working on new material for a follow-up, and this album indicates that things will only get better.<br /><br />Now, the storyline that is sure to be most talked about with this release is the introduction of new frontman Todd La Torre to the Queensryche fan base.  Yes, at times, Todd does sound a bit like the legendary former singer of this band.  However, it never sounds forced or contrived.  Todd La Torre shines on this album, and sounds like nothing more than a really great singer that was heavily influenced by the likes of Rob Halford, Dio, Bruce Dickinson, and former Queensryche frontman, Geoff Tate.  If anything, I really think that Todd may sound like Tate at times only because Barton mixed this album the same way he did those classic Queensryche albums, using a lot of the same techniques and effects he did back then.  Todd is electrifying and emotional, untamed yet restrained.  You won't hear many crazy vocal acrobatics here, aside from a few times when it fits the song; there is one note he hits at the 1:51min mark of \\"Don't Look Back\\" that will completely blow your mind.  And his singing isn't the only thing special about Todd La Torre.  He shows on this album that he is a very capable songwriter and lyricist, and has already formed a great chemistry with the other members of the band.<br /><br />Finally, believe it or not, there are two negative things I must say about this release, and thus the reasons I couldn't honestly give this album a Five-Star Rating.  First off is the actual length of the album; it clocks in around the 35min mark.  Some of the songs leave you wanting more, as if an extra verse or extended chorus and instrumental interlude could have been added.  Personally, I feel that they missed an opportunity with the track \\"A World Without\\".  Considering the subject matter (A man dealing with his wife dying during the birth of their first child) and Pamela Moore making a guest appearance on this track, I think they should have worked in a duet of Todd and Pamela, a kind of \\"conversation\\" of the two characters, but that's just me.  I find it hard to believe that they couldn't have added at least one more track to help bring the album out to the 40-45min mark; one 6-8min opus is all that's missing, IMO, to make this album completely stellar.<br /><br />The second negative is the mastering of the album.  Barton's mix is amazing, but the album was \\"brick-walled\\" when mastered (think \\"Death Magnetic\\" or \\"Vapor Trails\\").  There is really no head-space or breathing room here; some of the dynamics Barton caught on tape get lost.  Everything is pushed to the limit and, when played at high volumes over an extended period of time, this album can cause some hearing fatigue.  Thats right, your ears actually get tired because there aren't many breaks in the action (Great discussion on this in The Breakdown Room forums).  Recommend listening at mid to mid-high levels.<br /><br />All in all, this is the Queensryche album I have been waiting 20 years for!  I highly recommend this album to Queensryche fans around the world, and look forward to what the future holds for this incredible band!!!

B00418NVMQ|3.0|Really loved their first CD, but I didn't enjoy the live CD from that period. Why, I guess it's for the same reasons I don't like many live CDs. To put this in context, I am one of those people that love Emerson Lake and Palmer, but don't like their live CDs; and the same with Yes. [Yes, I've revealed my age] On the other hand Steve Morse and King Crimson sound great live. As for their DVD, I did enjoy that. I would give that 5 stars. Why? Because watching them makes up for what I didn't like. I do have to say that Lizzy should drastically trim her prologue a-cappella bit at the start of the CD/DVD.

0316056898|4.0|A mix between non-fiction and comedy.  I don't usually read books like this, but really enjoyed it.  Didn't know much about Tina Fey when I started.  So, some parts didn't mean as much, to me, as others might.<br /><br />Might have helped that we're the same age and I have done some theatre (nothing close to what Tina has, of course).  Helped me relate in that way & love her way of looking at some things.  Great sense of humor & interesting life.<br /><br />Thanks to my friend, Cheryl, for the book.<br /><br />(In a way, I wish I'd had a highlighter as I read - so many great pieces of advice included in the book and some down-right hysterical parts)

B000SKNIWE|5.0|Very good quality blueray format. David Attenborough is great as usual. Recommend this format of planet earth series. This does not contain behind the scene footages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It looks like temple run but the part is that the characters cost a lot of coins and unlock the treasure of the characters and Jake go's straight ahead. This game never ends and it really gets hard when it gets all the way
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a handy, simple to use way to check the weather.  It is easy to use.  Good for anyone.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game is challenging and fun for all ages. However towards the last challenge of each country, there are no hints or clues as to how to clear the board..if there were it would help to move on to the next level.
0375869026|5.0|This is a great book to read with your preteen. I got it to share with my grandson this summer when he comes to visit.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is fast moving to my must read list! This book , set in two eras, offers two time frames, both interesting. The characters are well developed and interesting. I definitely appreciate her setting excellent  backgrounds for her characters.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Love his books, they always change my cooking. As a natural healer I had been working with my clients on the nutritional facts he states in this book, but reading it totally organized how to teach and explain why fermentation is key.
0393317552|3.0|The book was in okay condition, which was expected. Some highlighting throughout and the cover was worn. However, book arrived quickly and served it's justice for a summer class I was taking. The book was also very interesting, I would recommend it to anyone interested in how agriculture and society progressed to what it is today.
B0013ND30W|5.0|My two year old is a princess fan of disney. Her first waltz was a tune to sleeping beauty. We have been getting great use watching it over and  over.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The first books I thoroughly enjoyed. The closer to the end of the series, the stranger things became. The books just lost their draw. Kind of disappointed.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I LOVED every part of this book and I cannot remember ever laughing so hard throughout a book.  The book is told through Drew's POV but the author does a fantastic job with it.  Seriously, do not let this be on your wish list any longer- read it!
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I love Angry Birds but this one is not for me. I guess if you are not a die hard Star Wars fan you just won't get this game. I will stick to the others.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is my kind of music, it has depth and substance. I find Macklemore's story fascinating and I honestly hope his music can engender positive social change.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It is the best book I ever read I mean who doesn't like sword fights and adventure and finally the hero gets the girl I was like i wish I was Percy when I read that part .
B008XG1X18|4.0|This works well on the fire, so much easier to see than on the little smart phone screen.  Great in the kitchen.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. Keeps me interested but doesn't frustrate me. Wish they had some<br /> more levels.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I have a kindle fire and it wont let me download!!But besides that its a really fun game (I play it on my phone)
0765325950|4.0|Hard to do a no spoiler review after literally years of following this series.  Yes, there are slow sections, especially towards the end of Jordan's tenure (RIP).  Sanderson does a very good job at picking up the many pieces to make sense of the many many plots.<br /><br />Sanderson does a great job of making an entire book out of the Final Battle without wearing out the audience, and without cutting stories off early. If you gave up on the series a couple books before the end, you will be happy picking it back up and seeing how the stories end. There are some tentacles that you will think are brought up just to close, but better than not bringing them up at all (thanks Lost).
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|It is a real good book, I will read it again in the future. I recommend it for a must read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was a great book hated how it ended hope I don't have to wait six months for the coclusion
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is one of the best room escape games I've ever come by. it's not too easy and not too hard! i love how it's a whole room and not just one scene too. great layout, never crashes, fun and addicting.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|OUR WHOLE FAMILY LOVES THIS GAME! It has engaging puzzles for mind bending fun with great little bits of history adding to the fun!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The story is a little hard to get in to in the beginning because it's told through written letters fromm the narrator to a stranger.  The narrator is a little more immature and socially awkward than what I remember my teen years being like.  It's definitely a satisfying read.  Sad but uplifting at the same time.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Maggie Smith performs as you would expect from such a great actor.  You expect an exceptional performance, and you get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it okay but they need to make more freakking rooms so I can freakking play it some more and the other rooms better be free. just saying
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I'm going to do some YouTube vids and I wanted a good external mic to go with my Canon Vixia camera. This is very able, has good pickup and a lot of cord. The only cons I have are with the foam spit screen, which keeps falling off and the fact that it has no light to remind you that the mic's battery powered pre-amp is on. I am sure since my last session, having kept it on for more than 24 hours, it is dead. I will test. That aside, it is a very decent mic for the price and I recommend it highly.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did leave it on all night after a session of testing and the battery held up. I don't know if the mic goes to sleep or not, but I am going to keep using it til the battery runs out. Very nice.
0307476073|1.0|I was so disappointed in the book due to the fact that she used the PCT! She should have waited to hike the trail in all earnest, and not in parts. I returned my book!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written story that keeps you engaged and allows you to feel empathy for the characters. Loved 'The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' and this one is proving to be just as gripping and full of emotion
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Nice game wish I had better internet<br />Hello out there help me find a way to get free WiFi<br /> Please
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|But now, every time I open it to play, it has to download to my Kindle again.  I am uninstalling it from my Kindle and will try re-installing it, but if it keeps happening, you drop to 1 star.
B007G92QGO|4.0|Lovely story, a bit slow in places, but I really enjoyed the book, if you like courtroom drama then this is for you
0062059963|4.0|While there were issues that kept this book from being better than the first in my eyes, I still enjoyed The Elite. After all the court intrigue and secrets that come out, and the tough position America is in at the end of the book, I am very interested in finding out how all of it will be resolved in the final book, The One.<br /><br />*8/10*
0316067598|5.0|Buy it, read it, enjoy it... pass it on!  This man's story brings a grown man to tears.  You can't read this book and fail to be moved. The pages speed by as you go.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|The giants are amazing. Acting is fun and there are a lot of fun shout outs to other genre movies.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|This is pretty ugly which is exactly why I chose it. I can find it when its on a surface with a lot of other things or in my bag or suitcase. It stands out and I can put my hand on it right away.
B009QA3VY2|5.0|Vivid writing, a bit slow on character development, but engaging and enjoyable, easy read. Partly occurs at the coast, so is a GREAT summertime novel.
B001NAT05W|4.0|I saw this when it came out in the movies and had all kinds of expectations about what Catwoman should be ... and was disappointed.  For grins, I watched it again on Amazon (year?s later), and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is a fun/funny movie.  Halley Berry looks/is great and Sharon Stone as the \\"Stone\\" villain is camp for the ages ... gotta love it.
B00130UFY2|5.0|Another great movie..well if you like high speed chases & cool fights..you'll enjoy it! Not the ending I would have wrote, but hey..I didn't write it!lol
0893860468|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of the truth.<br />Unlike many others, Nisargadatta cuts right to the core.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have enjoyed every book I have read by Sparks and this one  was no exception.  The movie should be good to see.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this series. This is a guilty pleasure. A glimpse back into time, richly decorated down to the last detail.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I am not very technological so finding this app was a real win.  It is easy to set and has a good variety of ringtones for you to chose from.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Witty, sarcastic, smart, edgy, interesting, and all around amazing. I loved this series. Too bad it was cancelled. The first 10 minutes is misleading and nothing like the actual series itself. Watch at least the entire first episode before you give up on this gem.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This is interesting but it's written in small interviews with no good overarching storyline.<br /><br />It may help if you are going to see the movie but the book is just ok
B000HC2LI0|5.0|How can you not like Martin Sheen?  Handsome, tremendously talented actor, AND he's Irish!  This show has intelligence, excellent writing, and great acting.  There are believable supporting characters - Allison Janney  (sp?) is wonderful!  A totally addictive series.  Enjoy!<br /><br />I honestly haven't opened this, since it's a Christmas gift for someone, so let's hope it WORKS.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It is retarded when you dry it you gotta bring it down your self then you cut it and it's a 80s look don't bye it .
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The weaving of stories into one lovely book is another success for Khaled Hosseini.  I found much of the writing to be poetic.  The depth of characters, the sense of being right there in their lives....what a pleasure to read!!!
B009PEKRY6|4.0|This album is a perfect summer album... The songs are fun and catchy. There's not much depth to the lyrics in certain songs but that's made up for in the heart and even vocal power that Bridgit displays. Her voice is so unique and soulful. I was very shocked and pleased to discover just what an amazing talent she really is.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|good game for everyone  the upgrade  is nice. i cant beat the game so far. need ton buy more new cars
B0049VZ222|5.0|I was finally convinced to check out the series. Amazon Instant Video made it so easy to watch every episode when I wanted to. Also, the episodes are less than from iTunes.
0762434279|5.0|Book is good. I goofed and ordered the wrong thing. Other than that they carried out their end of the purchase.
B005544TRQ|5.0|While a little far fetched at times the show has more twists and turns than any roller coaster I've been on and that's quite a few.  The characters are well cast and the writing is excellent.  I decided to give Suits a try after a friend of mine recommended it and power-watched the entire season in a few days.  Now I'm through the 2nd season and can't wait for the 3rd.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a hard read. It didn't flow as much as the first two, but it was full of emotion. I felt like the middle of the book dragged a little too long with improbable events (as though the rest of the series were more likely..). At the same time, I enjoyed the realness of most human interactions. In the end, this was a fantastic series.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|of course, what's not to love about the first prequel of an amazing story?! special features are great and overall awesome movie!
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I chose this rating because of the quickness of the delivery and the way it was packaged, also the great service and the fact I really liked the music.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes the groups of the 70's.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Not my favorite Die Hard movie but fun to watch. It seemed very short compared to others in the series and the story lines all felt rushed to me.  However, I do love the McLean character so I'll take it even at 3 stars.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Put those three stars together and you have a superb story.  Add in Ruth Hussey and it is a must-see movie!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Honestly this novel was not as well written as I had expected it to be. The authors British background shows through on every page making it distracting for the reader. The overuse of \\"baby\\" is strange, and some scenes are logistically confusing. The sex scenes can be very hot though.
0345803507|5.0|I am just starting to read the last of the three books of this series, but I know already that I have enjoyed the other two and will also<br />enjoy this one
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Just bought this new gaming mouse, as my old mouse that i got with my CyberpowerPC was a pretty crappy one. For $40 this mouse is the number one I have ever bought. It has 9 custom buttons (two being left and right click) and macro functions. The DPI levels work excellent and the program allows you to make your levels different. The color changing icon is cool too. If only you could change the DPI and scroller led colors. The feel is great for being right handed. The cord is also braided so its very rugged and strong. The driver installation was a breeze and required now downloads, just the app needed to be downloaded. I would recommend this to any beginner gamer or to anyone who wants a really nice mouse.
0345803493|5.0|I love to read and this author is good The story is intriguing.  It is a book that I would recommend
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie had many funny parts, and it wasn't completely lovey-dovey like most romantic comedies are. I enjoyed the movie throughout very much, but the ending wasn't great. I wish it would have ended on a more exciting note.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|A very insightful read into the ordinary lives of North Koreans and their experiences escaping to South Korea. I wold recommend this book to anybody interested in North Korea.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Not what I expected, and sometimes referring to the original movie too much, but all in all, worth seeing. I watched it twice, lol.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Loved Cheryl Strayed's courage and her story of hiking the PCT. The physical and mental journey she took was immensely interesting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game with so much to do. There are no rules at all so you can basically do whatever you want. The reason that this game is not like the PC is because you are playing this on a MOBILE DEVICE! Do you expect something that renders infinite worlds to be on a mobile device. NO! This game also has to be recoded to work in ios and the Android os. The game will get better, but stop complaining about the fact that it is different from the computer. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT!
1612680011|3.0|On one hand I want to give this book 4 stars because it is a great introduction to the four main ways to get money in this world. On the other hand, I found the information overly general. I have read this and cashflow quadrant and honestly felt like I had new ideas but 0% detailed information on how to work in each quadrant. I suppose it is a nice survey so that you can decide on which quadrant you want to work on. Then it will be up to you to find the right mentors and educational programs. I find this much needed and the writing is the kind that middle schoolers could understand since American schools tend to avoid talking about how to make money. It is really sad how developed our brains can be without including in it the development of profits. I say read this: decide on how you want to work and then seek out the best most precise financial information you can within that quadrant. Perhaps he did not want to date his book by becoming specific to any region or time but just know, financial matters are not an area to be general. It is specific down to the last fraction of a percent and you can get into big trouble if you don't take the time out to become sophisticated.
1401324649|4.0|Yes, the 100-year old-man-is a picaresque novel, if you want to be precise about definitions.  That said, he's no Huck Finn.  He is naive sometimes but sometimes not, as befits his age, and there's a Forrest Gump pastiche of interspersed unbelievable historical encounters.  They mostly work.  Fortunately the book relies on the personality of the main character for its joi de vivre.  Who doesn't want to escape now and then?
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved  it....Watched it all in 2 nights.  I can't wait for season 4 to start.  It's going to be a long time till Janurary....
0062014536|3.0|Yes, there does indeed need to be a law. For what? For writers who get us invested in characters and settings through two and 3/4 books, then leaves us with a non-ending. If we had such a law, I'm afraid Lauren Oliver would be paying the price right this minute.<br /><br />Possible spoilers ahead...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...I love Ms. Oliver's writing and this trilogy was no exception. I love that right up until the last moment, our heroine Lena is conflicted about her relationships, and that means almost all of them--the one with her mom, the one with Hana, the one with Alex, the one with Julian. I like that she's unafraid to fight for what she wants, and she even questions whether or not it's all worth it. I do like that we get the sense that the story's not really over, that our Invalids will continue the Good Fight for change. And right up until the final chapter, I was right on board the whole plot...still not sure how things would get resolved, but still on board.<br /><br />And then they didn't get resolved.<br /><br />There are open endings, and there are open endings. A good open ending leaves you feeling good about the characters and their futures, with a good idea of how everything will eventually play out. This ending is not one of those. No, indeed, this ending, with its talk of tearing down walls, doesn't let me know that the Invalids gained a thing, or that Fred paid the ultimate price, or that Hana learns to experience any emotions again, or that Lena even makes a choice. Of course, I believe her feelings for Alex are deeper and stronger than those for Julian, but if they do get back together, what does it say about her that she can turn her back on the one boy who never questioned her, never let her down? Quite honestly, after all we experienced in Requiem, I'm not even sure what the Invalids were fighting for was actually worth it. I mean, who wants to be hunted and mowed down repeatedly, always having to struggle for food, warmth, a home? No amount of love will overcome the fact that these people will die young and not in a good way through their deprivations. I'm not saying love isn't worth it exactly, but that even if the Invalids did succeed in taking over Portland, who is to say the other cities don't send more troops to destroy them?<br /><br />Oy.<br /><br />It's very sad that an ending that I'm sure the author labored over strikes the overall tone of this novel and its predecessors down so far. I could have overlooked Lena's indecisions and hurt had I found her relationships more redeeming, but as it stands, Hana is the one who stole the entire show in this finale. Hana made the big choices and gathered information along the way. Lena just rode the coattails of those around her and when the going got tough, she struck out on her own, leaving behind the boy who'd saved her life over and over.<br /><br />I'm not saying to not read this entry; in general, it's well written and I can interpret the ending as I wish. But seriously, I am so let down that I'd like to ask Ms. Oliver to consider one more novel to help wrap things up. As it stands, consider this reader very underwhelmed--but still giving the book 3 stars because of my enjoyment until the last chapter.o amount of love will overcome the fact that these people will die young and not in a good way through their deprivations.

0307950654|4.0|A sequel to Pride & Prejudice blended with a murder mystery- how could I pass that up?  I was very eager to read this story by an author I enjoy who tackled a sequel to another author I adore.  It was an interesting combination of atmospheric, arm chair cozy mystery and the P&P story continuation.  While I enjoyed reading the story, there was just something missing.  I'm not sure how to describe it other than it wasn't as spirited as I expected.  It focused on police procedure more than plot or character.  Not that I don't find that interesting sometimes, but I wasn't expecting it so much since this was a P&P sequel not just a murder mystery.  I guess we can chalk my impressions up to my own anticipation and assumption.<br /><br />The mystery was well done in that its not easy to work out and I liked how it wasn't obvious.  The set up beforehand with everyone uneasy about things raised my anticipation nicely.  I wasn't sure what to make of the slight alterations I saw in the P&P original characters, but I was willing to go with it and see what happened.  The trouble was that some of the changes like with Col. Fitz just left me wondering in the end because it was like the thread of his story was left dangling even after the secrets were all out in the open.  Darcy and Lizzy were parted a lot.  I loved the times when they were together and I loved the little snippets of their life.  Georgiana's storyline played a larger role which was interesting to see.  And even the 'love to hate' Wickham was a big presence once again.  The new character Henry Alveston was a nice addition too.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good read even though I had anticipated differently and had to adjust.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|For a free game, it sure does give you a lot of enjoyment. Considering the fact that it gives you missions and a lot of suits, it is one heck of a game to get!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Wasn't bad, but not hilarious.  Well-acted and touching at times.  Just not as &#34;hilarious&#34; as advertised.  Recommend for times when there's just nothing else to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app (we play on Samsung Nexus S Google phone with no trouble at all).  Gameplay is multi-faceted, and includes both standard \\"virtual pet\\" features, such as having to feed, stroke, and care for your horse, with added fun features that net you experience, health, happiness, and coins, such as:<br /><br />- cleaning pastures:  a race-against-the-clock mini-game that involves anticipating whether you are supposed to clean up weeds or horse poo and then poking the screen in the appropriate place to \\"clean\\" these things with the tool you are given (rake or shovel);<br /><br />- grooming your horse:  involves \\"wiping\\" the mud off with your finger (great for younger kids, as it's rewarding and simple - like \\"cleaning cages\\" in BirdLand.<br /><br />- training & events: first practise for events that you will \\"compete\\" in to earn coins, experience, etc, then compete. These events vary, and include timing-based mini-games, such as pressing a button when a moving bar is in a certain range, to make your horse jump over something.  (Be careful not use up all your horse's energy in training & events; it takes a lot to rebuild energy.)<br /><br />- mucking out stalls:  a timed mini-game that has you racing a clock to move dirty straw into buckets, with penalties for moving clean straw by accident. Then spread clean straw around to make a nice \\"bed\\" for your horse.  You'll be rewarded based on how good a job you do.<br /><br />- jobs: you can hire your horse out for lessons, pulling wagons, etc., whereby you earn extra money, experience, and so on.  Your choice whether to take short jobs (2 minutes is the minimum, but doesn't do much for you), or run the overnight 12-hour jobs, which provide a bigger payoff, or anything in between.<br /><br />- buying stuff:  you can buy horses and all sorts of gear, as well as upgrade stables, pasture, etc.  Options for spending virtual currency earned in-game are limitless - and you WILL earn if you are patient. You can also spend your own ACTUAL money to BUY virtual currency.<br /><br />And so on...there seems to be more unfolding with each level!  Fun enough for an adult because of all the things to keep track of, but with many aspects simple enough for even the youngest app-ready family member to help out with (just like on the REAL farm!).<br /><br />We are only on Level 6, but so far, this is one of the best apps I have seen, EVER.  It's got so many aspects to it that I can see it being interesting for quite a while.  Best of all?  No shooting!  :-)<br /><br />In closing, a note for those who are vocal about detesting In-App-Purchasing (which you can do a lot of in My Horse):<br /><br />Please don't complain that devs offer IAP. Developers need to eat and pay the light bill too, and considering the low, low price of FREE on this one, it's just kind of a courtesy to at least pony up for a few \\"gems\\" (their VC) if you're really having a good time.  Think of it as shareware - yeah, you COULD just love it and use it for free, but someone put their heart, soul and TIME into creating it for you, tossing them a fiver is just \\"the right thing to do\\".  This is how they earn their living, folks - I imagine you like to get paid for the work you do, too, and you'd probably prefer not to have to do it all initially for free and just HOPE someone appreciates you enough to write you a check.your own ACTUAL money to BUY virtual currency.<br /><br />And so on...there seems to be more unfolding with each level!

B006LSZECO|1.0|I couldn't wait to read this book. It must be great, I thought, because it's  been on the bestseller list for what seems like ages.  Well, reading this book was like root canal.  As a matter of fact, I'd RATHER have root canal!  Terrible characters, ridiculous story, boring, boring, boring.  Don't waste your time.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Very cute movie and digs into real issues around mental illness with sensitivity and humor. Great acting - I can certainly see why Jennifer Lawrence won the Academy Award.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome and so addicting  once i start playing i cant put it down ...cant wait for more levels
B002JXK5VU|5.0|If you watch the Syfy channel at all than you know most of the movies are cheesy, but many of the shows are really cool. Well Eureka is one of those really cool shows. It is fun to watch and very family friendly. My son and I have watched it for years on Syfy and we are starting over from the beginning here on Amazon. I wish they made more shows like this that families can watch together.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very good period piece on early 20th century English society.  Good story with great character development of interesting members of the household.  Well worth seeing and we recommend it to everyone we speak with about TV programs.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Predictable ending, but other than that, a great read! I finished the first and second book in four hours... Ridiculous.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|As with other Martha Stewart punches, this is great.  It cuts easily and works really well.  Watch a video on YouTube before you start and then it is simple.  I am using it for scrapbooking at the moment and the shapes are lovely.  Will probably use for cards another time.  Just wish the other cartridges were a bit cheaper!!<br /><br />Great product - don't hesitate to buy.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like the story line and cast of characters! The recurring guest stars adds to the entertainment factor and keeps me coming back for more.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|If your wondering why the controls are hard, this is what you do, you go to settings and there is game settings which you press. Then you have a option showing turning styles that is how you do it. It is supposed to be a good game.
B00847KFDS|5.0|This record was a birthday present for my 51 year old son who grew up loving Credence Clearwater. We listened to it after his birthday dinner and remembered old times. So glad he &#34;Wrote a Song For Everyone&#34;.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great basic watch at a very good price. Seiko quality. Self wind, water resistant. Put it on your wrist and forget it. Very accurate, no frills timepiece. And it looks good too!
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I had forgotten how young Matt Damon was in this movie.  If you like Grisham's books, then I think you'll like this movie - quite entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked this game.It makes you take the time to slow down and think about each move you make. Can't wait for more levels.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|The Royals track brought me to the album, just really love the sound. She's got a great style and for the most part I love the arrangements. As someone else mentioned, Biting Down isn't quite up to the rest of the EP. Otherwise, it's great and highly recommended. Hopefully she resists the urge to make the full length CD more 'pop' and keeps the unique sound.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Like an old friend, Boz is back.  This album of classics is great, Boz is in great form, and I recommend this album.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Just the right amount of suspense and romance.  It did the book justice.  Nice too that the male lead is true eye-candy!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Just not a real entertaining moving from start to finish. It did have a very few moments, but unless you really just want to kill some time, it is a good movie to miss.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My son is very happy with this t-rex. Good material and size. I think I will continue buying the whole collection.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In is an insightful, inspiring book for women AND men!  Sheryl does a great job illustrating the necessity of male involvement in the fight for equality in the workplace.  A partnership is required in the workplace and at home in order for women to lead. A book, which begs the question...&#34;can women truly have it all?&#34;
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|This story is excellent. There are many themes that the author goes over. I really enjoy how the book was written in a fashion that made the Godfather seen very powerful. There is plenty of action throughout the plot of the story.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Love it!  It's mysterious and kept me guessing.  Is there going to be a sequel?  'cause that ending makes me wonder what's going to happen next!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very well written storyline.  This is a down-to-earth setting, written about a very realistic situation, which parallels several real life current and recently past situations.  It is captivating.  Excellent quality video.  None of the current fad science fiction superhuman and non-real mechanical machines.  Just multiple good storylines.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Great characters, realism and settings.  Can't wait for the next episodes!  Nice that it is actually based on a historical figure Ragnar.  A wonderful imagining!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|each puzzle can be solved but you sometimes don't think it is possible. This is an enjoyable and challenging game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Me and my daughter both enjoyed it. Fun game and the whole family can get in on it plus it free to try.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love to take pictures & this app helps me enhance & display them! Great for the photo journalist inside all of us!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie has everything.  If you like guns, swords, Kung Fu and humor, this movie is for you.  Everybody plays a wonderful part.  Buy all means buy this two disk special edition version or lots of extras.  But buy this for a wonderful move, especially seeing how the government is trying control all of our lives, these days.  A thoughtful movie at best.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Brad Cooper is great, but Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro are not right for their roles.  Brad Cooper's transformation from a crazy guy to a normal one is kind of abrupt.
B000CNFC76|5.0|If ;you play golf ore like watching golf, this is the move for you.  The characters are presented dramatically and thoughtfully.  A wonderful movie of adversity and perseverance.  The price was great.
B000244G36|2.0|McClintock & American West, 1963 film<br /><br />The 1963 movie stars John Wayne in an unusual Western. Many of the past cultural cliches have been reversed, as if it is a parody of earlier movies. You can recognize parts of earlier movies (the spanking scene from \\"The Quiet Man\\". Big landowner McClintock is not out to exploit the new homesteaders over their lack of water. In fact, he warns them about these conditions. [He would lose these grazing lands.] So how does grass grow on the Mesa Verde? This story seems to be patched together from earlier movies, as if it was produced as a quick money maker. [Wayne's \\"The Alamo\\" was not a success.] The unintentionally funny part is where this 19th century land baron talks about creating parkland from his estate! I found this to be anachronistic. Would McClintock really own a large brick house in the middle of nowhere whose interior was clean like some city home? How many servants were needed to maintain it?<br /><br />\\"The American West of John Ford\\" is a tribute to this famous movie director who won many Hollywood Oscars, none for a Western. John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Henry Fonda talk about their movies. It provides a summary of John Ford's movies. Western movies became part of American culture. Some people today talk about \\"Dodge City\\" as a bad example of gunfights when in fact they had gun control for visiting cowboys. A cowboy was a hired rural worker whose lot was not envied by most people. They were unskilled labor used by big cattle barons for seasonal work. Since there were no railroads in Texas (then), their job was to herd cattle over hundreds of miles to the railroad stations in Kansas. Some paid the tolls to cross Indian Territory in Oklahoma, some tried to avoid fares and found conflict from their trespassing.<br /><br />Mike Wright's book \\"What They Didn't Teach You About the Wild West\\" is a good book to read, like his other books.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|It was a great movie.  I will be buying it.  Love the gore and it was an awesome take on the old story
B00000IREA|1.0|Barbarella, 1968 film<br /><br />It begins with an astronaut removing her protective space suit while floating in the air. She gets a message from the President, Durand-Durand has disappeared after inventing a new weapon. This could mean war. \\"Something must be done.\\" Her mission is to find him and preserve the peace. She is given a detector and a weapon. Her spacecraft will travel to Tao city in 154 hours. Something happened to the navigation system, she needs the manual back-up. She exits from the spacecraft after it lands. She is captured by twin girls! She is tied up and sees some walking dolls that click their teeth and bite her flesh. Help arrives to capture these young children, a Catchman. There is talk about scientific tests before making love. Barbarella dresses in furs.<br /><br />She returns to her spacecraft. A winged man comes to visit. They go to a strange place, the labyrinth. People are exiled here. A pistol destroys one of the guards. Pygar regains the will to fly (after therapy). He transports Barbarella through the sky. They arrive at a new place and find new dangers. Where is Pygar? They are trapped and threatened with death. Barbarella descends to a lower level and meets the Great Tyrant. She finds Pygar and uses a weapon to free him. A captured Barbarella is placed in a cage with ravenous birds (parakeets?). She drops in at the Revolutionary headquarters. She touches palms with the leader. They have a map to the Queen's chamber. She sees women smoking water pipes and joins in. Barbarella is placed in a device that affects her emotions. The fuses are blown! She finds Durand-Durand (surprised?). Can they enter the Queen's Chamber of Dreams? They need the key.<br /><br />\\"Nothing can stop me now!\\" Barbarella is trapped. She explains what happened. The Revolutionaries destroy all the Guards. Durand-Durand goes to use the Positronic Ray to destroy his enemies. What can be done to stop him? The Queen has a solution. What if Durand-Durand's plan goesawry? Will if be the end of him? Pygar flies away with Barbarella and the Queen. You can surmise the ending.<br /><br />\\"Barbarella\\" was a French comic strip for adults. Does that make it a good movie? It needs a good story to make a good movie. Does this movie have any \\"redeeming social values\\"? I didn't see any. Was it meant as a parody about society? Is this the kind of movie that makes \\"science fiction\\" a turn-off for many people? Jane Fonda went on to star in other movies during her career. She was married to a French movie director at this time.
B00BOX0K0M|4.0|A bit flimsy and I would think prone to scratches if not treated with kid gloves, but otherwise ok. A little expensive for what you get.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love the story and the whole thing! Great lesson for children to learn! Someone bad turning into a good person just for love! Really got me! :-)
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Works well enough, took it diving on the Great Barrier Reef and seems to make the colours better. Hard to tell as the day I went it was overcast for most of the time. Also in one of the resultant videos, it looks like a bubble got trapped underneath the filter in front of the lens, again hard to tell if that's what really happened. Otherwise, fits well and easy to take on and off. Could prove to scratch easily if not handled properly, luckily it has the microfibre bag for storage.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a very interesting and entertaining series especially if you watch it from pilot to last episode.  This adaption of Sherlock Holmes is one of the greatest. Each episode adds a little more to the storyline and you witness the bond between Sherlock and Watson become stronger. The cases are very intricate and Sherlock is very funny too.
1400052181|5.0|Every researcher or physician should read this book.  A gripping story about the HeLa cells used by millions of research labs.  I loved learning about the history of Hopkins and Baltimore too.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Yes! I loved it! I listened to it when I went on vacation.<br />When I get some more money I plan to buy other CD's.<br />I plan to use the list Amazon suggested!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a page-turner from start to end.  Can't say I loved the ending but also didn't see it coming which is a marker of a great book.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|I happen to enjoy Michael Pollan's  writing style, so I was not at all surprised that he could take a subject that seems very simple to document, and still make you really think about what you are reading. Michael has a &#34;gift&#34; of being able to allow the reader to view everyday things in a totally different light, once you have read &#34;Cooked&#34; you can not go back and unread it.....your view of humanity may be forever changed. I must say, that not everyone wants to know what is behind the curtain, but for those people that want to make informed decisions Micheal is able to inform the reader and yet give you the freedom to make your own everyday life decisions.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Just didn't care for it.  Felt like it was more about introducing his kids for future movies.  Didn't hold my interest and felt let down at the end.
1878424319|5.0|A friend told me to read this and it was great! Describes my thought process to a T! High quality book that'll change your outlook. MUST READ!
B000O14VAU|5.0|Fun and entertaining first movie of a very fun and entertaining series.  Hope Amazon will put the other movies in this series on instant video.
B009AMANBA|5.0|About ten of us watched this on movie night at our complex.  Everyone enjoyed it.  It's long but worth the extra time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a compelling story. It is not a suspense thriller. It is a story, probably,  all too true in the part of the world in which it is set. I became totally involved in the story and felt I KNEW the characters. I will recommend to my friends who have shared  the joy of reading  Hosseini's other books
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|This game is great. Everything about it is cool. But now the app always force closes a few seconds after I run it everytime. This hasn't happened before. I hope it gets fixed soon.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|After many ho-hum &#34;American Songbook&#34; cd's and even the &#34;Great Rock Classics&#34; and &#34;Soulbook&#34; , Rod has finally put out a cd with new material, and it's about &#34;Time&#34; (pun intended).  Great mix of great songs from a great performer! 'Nuff said.
159463176X|5.0|Right from the first page you get into this beautifully book. I could not put  it down. The story is both sad but very moving. It lets you into a world you know nothing about. The way other people live and how they cope. The author has a beautiful way with words.<br />An interesting subject and a joy to read.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Definately a great app for those learning or already great at guitar. Huge database for songs. Works great on my android tablet. Love it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a unique writer who can take the lives of people and weave a story like a tapestry. Each chapter could have been developed into a book unto itself. He is ability to touch the heart and craft the story so that you get something special from each plot. I wouldn't have thought that after 2 incredible books he could come out with a third as good, but he has.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Don't overlook the scenery, costuming, sex, gore, and semi-history by trying to find something deep to mull over in this period series, spun out from the moment Vikings first raided Lindisfarne Abbey in Northeast England during the last decade of the Eighth century CE.  There's plenty of all that.  The only tabus involved are too ancient to matter any more, so we are left only with a sort of dry curiosity about the interplay of Viking culture with Viking passions. What we are compelled by is something else altogether and altogether unexpected. What's on the line is faithfulness.<br /><br />Take the case of the Earl, Haraldson. He is easily defined by the verdict he deals out in a not-so-clear-cut case of homicide:  &#34;Since you're going to die, how do you want to die?&#34; Earl Haraldson keeps faith with his thanes in this sense, that he metes out death and meets death by the immutable law of his own will.<br /><br />The earl to come, Ragnar Lodbrok, naturally enough, is Haraldson's foil in mayhem. Oh, he kills plenty, and his will is fully a match for Haraldson's. The thing about Ragnar is that the social complex in which he keeps faith is based both in his will and his instincts. Particularly alive in him is the passion to achieve undying fame among the gods under the watchful eye of Odin.<br /><br />Into this warrior mix is thrown one Brother Athalstan.  Once apparently an extraordinarily talented scribe at Lindisfarne Abbey, he just managed to salvage an antiphonary and cross before being dragged away to Viking hell. Ragnar Lodbrok's whimsy is curiosity about the &#34;Priest,&#34; as he calls Brother Athalstane, but Ragnar's device is to exploit Athelstane's knowledge for conquest. In the end, Athelstane is a bit-player in the Viking scheme, able to keep faith with his master and unable to break faith with the Triune God.<br /><br />Athelstane is the one character totally out of character for the conventions of his time or ours. His face is an icon and he clings to the icons of cross and scripture as defense within a world wholly defined by passions. So far, this history channel offering is a fascinating excursion, dragging this viewer into a world I can neither love nor hate, with only the defense of recognizing its opposite through the eyes of an eighth-century monk rendered virtually voiceless. Why would God send him there? Brother Athelstane asks this question with tears. We are allowed to ask, Why, indeed?
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great spin on the traditional Sherlock Holmes worth buying the first season. We really enjoyed Lucy Liu in this role of Watson.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I read this book because I am in love with the movie directed and produced by hayao Miyazaki .... It is very different than the movie but it is so fun and entertaining and goes into more depth with the magic than the movie does.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers...it is not too easy and not too hard but definitely I wish it were longer.  I am looking forward to new rooms.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I watched this with my two teenagers. Rated R mostly for fowl language but it's in French so what the heck. Some innuendo but no overt sexuality. Very engaging characters, extremely funny, thoughtful movie
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I want. it now and check out crazy hippy #1. on you tube<br />it is very funny pleas with a cherry on top
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Bought this not long before we went to a Tom Petty concert.  Love his music and this did not disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like my horse it is fun to interact with the horses. alMy usermame is cnriney so friend me if you want!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and the point of view it took. Very good read. Two thumbs up.  I recommend for anyone, but young African American or African women in particular.
B00846REIS|5.0|then you will love this one too!  The girl is very low on self esteem, but if you can get past that, it is worth it.  Not sure if I like he name Gideon for the guy though.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good game but sometimes you lose gems or gear and multiplayer can be buggy. I got killed when i had good armor by mobs 20 levels lower than me
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You'll love this trilogy....but it left me hanging...there will be more after you read all three.  No 'red room' in this series though.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think for the next update for it would be a good idea to put rail roads mine cart, a boat and a portal to the end
B002U0KHMY|5.0|this is the one that I want to watch it since I watched the season 2 & 3 already, I just wonder how did Mat Boomer got out in jail..
B003Y5H542|5.0|John Deppy is awesome!! My favorite actor and great and funny movie, the director is great too!!<br /><br />See the moviee!!!!
B000683VI4|5.0|I can't wait this dvd to arrived I watched it already when first came out but I still want to watched it again its a good story
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|The best game ever.  The best game ever.<br />The best game ever.<br />The best game ever.<br />The best game ever.<br />The best game ever<br /><br />It is so go you could have the<br />stuff for real. It is like you have a baby
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book one, book two, now I look forward to three.<br />One and two left me wanting.....to know...to see.<br />Suzanne Collins has captured the pure essence of suspense.<br />All the cliches; cliff hanger, leaves you wanting more, can't bear to wait.  The list could go on and on.<br />I can't get anything done and I get angry when I have to put the book down.<br />Sleep now for tomorrow morning I get to start on book three.<br />Sweet dreams.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've always been a fan of diary of a wimpy kid and this is another great addition to the series. Really funny book !!
B00005N6KG|1.0|I've been having trouble finding ear/headphones to run in since my ears are small, and this was one of the worse products that i've tried.<br /><br />100 feet into my run, it started falling off/up my head (note: my hair was in a pony tail), maybe if my hair were down the headphones would stay, but that would defeat the purpose.<br /><br />The earbud section was also awful, and would not stay in at any angle. Don't even get me started on the sound quality... it was almost as if someone had specifically designed the worst possible headphones :(
B008G3N71W|4.0|Most books of this genre are (may I say it?) crap. But I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I liked the main character Greta and it kept me guessing what would happen next. (I was usually wrong.) I found her evolution interesting and enlightening. There were some hints about where this was going (no spoiler) and I was prepared to dislike the book because the activity (fetish?) that the story led to is one I don't find the least bit interesting or erotic, but the author made it interesting and even made it seem a natural part of Greta's maturation.<br /><br />Needless to say this book isn't for everyone. If you aren't open to sexual variations, go away. If you are interested in the sexual development of a young woman, you might find this an interesting read. What's the saying? \\"Different strokes for different folks.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it and will be checking out some of this author's other works.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I purchased this set for my husband for Father's Day.  He is a huge Trek fan.  He has not stopped watching this since I bought it.  This set is packaged in an awesome box set.  The picture of the movies are beautifully enhanced and bring you back to the beginnings.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|I cannot use enough descriptive adjectives to encourage others to watch this series. It is well-written, tightly-edited and and superbly-acted. It has kept me wanting more since its first episode, and has yet to let me down. I have recommended it to all my family and friends; those who have chosen to listen to my ravings (which are numerous, as I watch LOTS of TV) have not been disappointed with this series...most have found themselves as taken with it as I. I must tell you I think that, judging from the responses of those around me, it may appeal more to a male demographic than a female, but don't let that discourage you from watching. Gotta watch the good TV while we can, my friends.
1400052181|4.0|I dig healthcare. After growing up with two doctor parents and then spending the past four and a half years working at a hospital, I'd say I know quite a lot about the industry. Modern medicine blows me away - I think we've come so far in such a short amount of time, and I can't wait to see what advances are coming. Now having said all that, I have to admit that this book shook me a little bit. With all the benefits that medicine provides us with, you tend to skim over an important subject - at what cost were these developments made? And this book addresses just that.<br /><br />So clearly, I thought The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks contained extremely fascinating subject matter. Unfortunately the book itself fell a tad short of my expectations. There were a lot of unanswered questions at the close of the book. I just sort of felt that if Skloot was going to commit to doing this big expos&eacute;, she should have finished telling the story. Although, the book was starting to teeter onto the \\"too long\\" side, so maybe it was a conscious choice to leave out some of the details.
B00CEB5QU2|3.0|Thie Kingston MobileLite Wireless SD Card reader works great as a device that gives you the ability to share, copy, and view files on an SD card, for example you can take an SD card out of a camera and view your photos on a larger tablet.  The other powerful use is the ability to store large files such as presentations, movies, large audio libraries, etc. save space on your portable device, and share those files with up to 3 users simultaneously.<br /><br />The MobileLite is not a tiny device, 5\\" long, 2.25\\" wide, and 5/8\\" thick, on one end is the SD card reader slot and when inserted the SD card is completely enclosed with a spring push to eject. On the other end of the device is a micro USB for charging the reader and standard USB that you can use for a small amount of emergency power. Don't expect to use this device as a portable battery but in a pinch you can pull out enough power to get a few more minutes out of your portable device. (if you have your charging cable with you). Near the charging port is a single power button, slightly recessed to eliminate accidental activation as well as the need to press and hold to activate or shut down the WiFi signal.<br /><br />To access the device from your portable device you connect to its own WiFi SSID and using the somewhat flakey MobileLite app or over http you can configure most WiFi hotspots and use the MobileLite as an access router. I would prefer being able to set the MobileLite to join MY network but that just is not possible, you must configure your portable device to join the MobileLite network. You can set the SSID and security to meet your needs. Note the network is set to 192.168.200.0 with the router at 192.168.200.254 The most frustrating issue is any configuration change such as adding WiFi for Internet access causes the MobileLite to restart thus dropping your connection and most likely having your portable device lock back on to the WiFi you just added to the MobileLite requiring you to go back and change what WiFi you are using on your portable device again.<br /><br />Battery life on WiFi is excellent. The device easily lasts all day with occasional use and can make it through at least 2 full length movies on a full charge.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />Buy if you travel and need additional space for movies, want to share movies or music in the car or airplane.<br />Try if you are wanting to use it every day, dealing with the WiFi configuration for it to connect to the Internet was not the best experience for me and I would prefer to connect both my portable device as well as the MobileLite to an existing network instead of going through the MobileLite to access the Internet.<br />Don't buy if you are primarily looking for a portable battery to give an extra charge for your portable device
B000OXHRRC|4.0|A very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. Nice to see Russell Crowe in a more lighthearted role. The book was better of course, with many more story lines, but this was great.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I know, it's thriller pablum, but &#34;The Innocent&#34; provides a relaxing summer read. Will Robie has established himself as a genuine American hero.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have read the books and I can't get enough of the show!  Do yourself a favor and buy this Season if you've bought the last one because you'll want to keep it forever in your DVD collection!
159463176X|5.0|A beautiful piece of writing.  The culture comes strongly to the page.  Hosseni is an excellent writer.  It is hard to believe he does not live in Afghanistan now.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is such an easy & fun way to organize your ideas & visions. Currently planning my wedding via Pinterest!!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|It's even better than I remember.  I'm now into the second of the seven seasons, and it's a great collection to watch again.
B005CGI3ZG|3.0|Can't watch it on my laptop (and it's rather new, purchased in Dec 2012)... for some reason I can only watch it on certain DVD players... :(
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Picked it up for free on the Amazon App store. Definitely worth it for free and helps me manage my crappy battery life in the DROID RAZR.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game. It looks wonderful on my kindle fire. I can't wait for the next levels to open up. :-)
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Enjoyed it and would recommend it to my friends and family for light entertainment.  Shows what traveling with family might be like.
B000067QMD|4.0|Not sure why I bought them but if you need sealing discs these work fine with the Avent bottles.  I think I used it once to shake formula but it was a pain to then switch the nipple so I didn't use it again.  Waste of money.  I'm a first time mom that bought everything and anything.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun way to pass time. I didn't give this five stars because this is really short. But I think there will be updates to add more levels so yeah I'll deal with it. It's an overall great game though.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My daughter has probably watched this a million times and loves it.  Loves the tv series.  We have every episode recorded on our DVR.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've followed Downton Abbey since it premiered the first season.  Bought seasons 1 and 2 DVDs and needed season 3 to complete my library.  Really enjoyed this fine program.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My 7 and 8 year old granddaughters just love this game!  They can spend hours playing it.  It is a very good exercise for remembering what they have seen and the value placed on the pets, etc.  They are learning to save their coins so they can shop for what they want.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game. Both my nine year old and I enjoyed playing. great graphics fun plot and just the right amount of game time with a fun bonus chapternthat wraps it all up
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My two granddaughters have more fun with this game.  They know all of the animals and memorize what is where, etc.  I enjoy watching them play and then try to explain what is going on to me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game to play although could give you more bingo credits faster. Getting harder to get all the pieces of the puzzles too.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|Walk Off The Earth is an awesome group and this album is just awesome too!  Love all the songs on it and just love this group
B004DLPXAO|3.0|kinda hard to handle on the ward so have to settle for the book instead now & use kindle another time
0679809015|5.0|After reading the reviews I knew the book would be small but when it got here it was actually smaller than I was expecting it to be, but it has more pages than I though it would so it worked out. It is a very cute book. It's a great book to travel with and although the flaps can be hard to locate at first, once the flaps have been opened it's much easier for the little ones to find them and open them.
B005O7PXNS|4.0|I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because I reserve 5 stars for my ABSOLUTE favorites, but this is amongst my favorites. I can always counts on Castle to have some laugh out loud moments in every episode, a good storyline (denouement and all), and some personal drama along the way. This season is fraught with more serious character and plot developments than the previous three, and has a more consistent season, less of an episodic feel.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I loved the show. I feel I know these people. Am very upset it was cancelled. However, they did tie up the loose ends.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a great game.I play it when I'm bored.Its a great time waister!If you want even more 3D graphics get temple run 2.I hope you love the app as much as I do!
1476733953|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years. I was puzzled by the title and normally don't read a lot of sci-fi but I couldn't put the book down. I was late to work the other day because I stayed up so late reading! Do yourself a favor and buy this book! Best investment you will make in 2013.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|A very good product for the price you pay. Cheap and durable. It's great for someone who is starting to DJ or if you want to do some amateur stuff at home.
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|This book was a wealth of great insights and tactical suggestions for anyone in a new position within or moving between organizations or even just locations. My Evernote is now filled w/ detailed tasks to do during my first 90 days. Fortunately I work now someplace hat lives this book.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie that much. I wasn't looking forward to seeing it, I just watched it because I have the flu. The preview was the best part, the cgi was ok and the acting was less than the actors usual caliber.  Seriously, it was just Meh...
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I love this game because you can Color you can color. the hair it is really cool. my big sister likes my game.  Ps I sooo. love this game
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is better than I expected it to be, honestly. There is more to it than the usually hidden items games. There are times I whould like to play it longer than they give me energy levels for, though. That part of the game disappoints me, but I am sure that is how they get people to buy things in game. I recommend the game and do enjoy it. Thank you!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It will make you 4 $ho! Great for getting to work on time. App that transcends the tablet and keeps you in the job.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I have the book and wanted to see what was done in the film.  I thought that it was a very good movie.
B005R32L66|4.0|You can text and video call, pretty cool stuff. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
B002KKCVT6|4.0|Nice fit, beefier sole than my last pair, but that was 7 years ago.  I like the higher arc support.  Some may feel they are pricey, but they are going to last at least 6 years.  I live in SoCal, so it's not like they sit in a closet for over 3 months a year.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|loved this book. So glad I read this book the previous reviews love this book and so did I. They were so right, next is alaska
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have really enjoyed his previous books and this one was no different. We hear nothing but terrile things about the mddle east and again this story begins before all the wars.
B001C34HUS|4.0|This is a very straightforward look at creative thinking. I had hoped it would help more with the terrors of the blank page that strikes many creative people. What it did do was remind and reassure me of the process I use without realising it - hopefully encouraging me to be more attentive and thorough in the future
B009XIXVU6|3.0|While the book is rich in Pakistani culture and landscape, the storyline left this reader wondering if there were too many subplots to be fully developed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series! So glad I started it and now I know what the hype is all about!  :) Can't wait to watch the next one, but I don't want to finish it TOO fast. It's like reading a great book, you don't want it to end.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This series started out great, and even got adopted into a TV series. But the series should have ended books ago. The author is out of juice and only writing for the sake of money. There's no passion or engaging content. Why are you wasting our time and money? I was so disappointed by the book: Sookie woke up and went to the garden. Sookie finishing gardening. Sookie talks to friend Sam. What? If I could return it I would.
1616550414|5.0|If you are a fan of the Legend of Zelda series, buy this book, even if you're not a fan of reading. There is plenty of pictures of all the Zelda games, including idea sketches from the latest game, Skyward Sword.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I knew that I would instantly love this memoir. I was hooked and took me only about 2 sittings to finish-- I just didn't want to set it down! The only thing I didn't like was the repetitiveness of some aspects of the book, but still a very interesting read, and worth the money!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game!! You really have to use your brain, especially since there are no instructions whatsoever.<br />Wow
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|There ought to be some page to show how the thing works. I can't even move one of the balls.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.  The chapters alternate between perspectives of two of the main characters, which is a great way to see things from both angles.  The narrators were both enjoyable and I liked reading from both of their perspectives.<br /><br />The book was well-written and I felt like I could picture characters and events as they happened.  I thought the character development was excellent and the characters were richly drawn.  Each of the characters was unique and I felt strongly about all of them!  Some of them I really loved and cared about and some of them I actively hated.  I know that when I am that emotional about characters in a book, that the author has done something right.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much about the plot, but it is excellent and moves through many years in the lives of the characters.  As a reader, I got very connected to the characters and really cared about them and what would happen to them.  The book definitely packs an emotional wallop, but I think most readers will enjoy it.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|haven't used it as a clock or whatever. Just like the soothing sound of the water. Liked that you could change the sounds.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Queensryche has finally recovered the sound that so many people have been missing over the last decade. This album is a true return to their classic form, with layered guitars, moody, atmospheric passages, Eddie Jackson's booming bass, and Scott Rockenfield's intricate drumming. The songs themselves all bring to mind the band's classic EP-Promised Land era, but updated for the year 2013. Songs like \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\" and \\"Spore\\" recall albums like Rage for Order, while \\"In This Light\\" and \\"Fallout\\" call back to Empire while still sounding fresh and new. The highlight of Queensryche's self-titled LP, for me, is \\"A World Without,\\" a hauntingly creepy, moody song that tells the story of... well, just go search for singer Todd La Torre's explanation. A guest vocal from the amazing Pamela Moore (aka Sister Mary) elevates the song even higher.<br /><br />Also back are the intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics that we haven't heard since Tribe. This album will make you think, but not tell you how to think--something that has been sorely missing from this band's output for quite some time. They are back to being the Thinking Man's Metal Band.<br /><br />Long-time fans shouldn't be scared off by the change in singer--Todd La Torre simply sounds amazing on this record. And he sounds like himself, not a clone of another singer. His singing is top-notch, and is the best vocal performance on a Queensryche release since the 90's. This guy is the real deal, and we should all be thankful that Michael Wilton got him into the Queensryche world.<br /><br />This album doesn't get five stars from me because it isn't perfect (only Operation: Mindcrime gets that rating from me), but is definitely excellent and worth buying. It's a little short, and songs like \\"Open Road\\" could have been expanded a bit for more effect, but all in all I'd give this record 8.5/10 if I could rate it in those terms here.<br /><br />Queensryche are finally back--BUY THIS CD!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the levels are not all easy so this game is actually challenging and fun. time seems to fly by when playing these puzzles.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book series !!!  Very well written, and I didn't want to put the book down once I started reading.
B00BJS7104|5.0|It's a superficial tale, but had a great story line. Lots of action , intriging, but far fetched at times. Had I lived during that time I'm sure I would have helped the underground railroad. It was a lawless time, with extream measures and ruthless means to stay hidden.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book series.  Very riveting... I didn't want to put the book down once I started reading it.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Great to read the book after watching Castle for several seasons. Recommended for anyone who likes mystery and suspense novels.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not bad when you're bored. Graphics are decent and this is a good time wasting game. Pretty easy to catch on how to play and to level up is super easy.
B00BYISQTO|4.0|good band with those bass sounding vocals, own about 4 of their albums,definetly have their own sound, a solid effort
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Love Josh and it's a rare day that I don't play this album at least once. I have all of his albums and it is a good addition.
B00C061I3K|5.0|say what you want about EDM,but these guys are good. Ashamed to admit it but lived the disco times, and it's nice to have party,dance music around
B002DPH936|4.0|Haven't played it yet. Saw the movie and loved it. Bought it because our local theatre did the play. Love Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham<br />Cater and Alan Rickman.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|acting is superb,when I watch,I escape into that world of the zombie apocalypse,and it is creepy. Some of the characters a little strong(Shane),but Rick and crew are awesome
B009AMANBA|4.0|As both a Daniel Day Lewis fan and a Civil War buff, I liked the film.<br />However, I felt it could have shown more of what was going on in the Nation<br />outside of Washington during 1864-65. I feel the film would have been more riveting<br />if there were more Civil War related scenes. For instance, the surrender at Appomattox<br />would have provided a nice touch and helped to weave some additional history in with the<br />story and possibly make the film more appealing to young people.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|this remains one of the cleverist and great television shows,can't help but love the great cast spearheaded by Andrew Lincoln
B001CDWFPC|1.0|Disappointed. I cannot even navigate thru the bible without it crashing. I really wish this would get fixed! I had really hoped to use this as my main study bible.
B008B11R1Q|3.0|kind of droal,have to be in the mood, certainly not bad,but I would have a hard time playing it constantly
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once you start this book you won't be able to stop! Your eyes will be glued to every single page.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I saw the play first, which was wonderful.  The songs are so catchy, and really capture the essence of the characters.  Billy Porter has a spectacular voice, and the rest of the cast  was wonderful as well.  Kudos to Cyndi Lauper.  All of the Tony awards were well deserved!!
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|1st season starts out pretty weak. Some bad acting, some very improbable actions on the part of certain characters. I'm hoping it gets much better in later seasons. Most shows take some time to figure out their identity and develop chemistry with the actors so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt so far.
0007492898|5.0|This age of information could not be more perfectly assessed, in an intuitive and graphically appealing book than this one!
B0095VPBM2|5.0|This CPU was purchased for an inexpensive office build, and it has surpassed all my expectations.  Handles web browsing, media streaming, and GPU-accelerated HD video playback without issue.  A+
0345522478|5.0|I putt off reading the reviews for this series because to me the covers looked a little like romance novels.  The old saying came to mind \\" never judge a book by its cover\\".  I thoroughly enjoyed this listen, the characters were great, had depth, and the story moved at lightning speed. A perfect balance of fantasy and reality, so glad I can go right on to the next.  A Two thousand and something old Druid and a hilarious dog take you through a great adventure along with many fantastical creatures.<br /><br />The narrator did a great job and was very easy to listen to. I highly recommend, even though I jumped on this band wagon a little late.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book.  Toward the middle it gets a little bit 'scientific' or too many facts but if you aren't interested in that portion, just skim through those chapters and it gets better again.  Highly recommend
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great book!!! I loved it!  I love all of the characters in this book series ... Charlaine does well with tying up all the loose ends...
B005Y1B3Q0|1.0|after the first dvd never arrived,  second one was sent out.<br />Arrived in 2 days as stated...but....the damm dvd would not play!!!!!!<br /><br />I'm so disappointed,  the was a GIFT!<br /><br />Not a HAPPY CAMPER.......<br />Ed
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love to play this game and can spend hours playing this game. I would recomend this game to anyone!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Works great. I've dropped by iPhone a few times since I've owned the case and the phone has never shattered or been broken in anyway. Works just like the day I bought it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Great movie in great condition; do not know why this Disney film did not get more credit, fun movie for the whole family
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I LOVED it...it &#34;spoke&#34; to my inner adventurer. It's given me the thought that I might,just, be able to fulfill my dreams.
B0081336FO|5.0|Enjoying this as much as I enjoyed Season 1. i like the unconventional protagonist and the interpretation of Watson. The plots and other characters such as the dominatrix are also fascinating.
B000002AP1|5.0|The CD looked and sounded brand new. I am very happy with the quality and arrival time for this CD.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is the best reinterpretation of Conan Doyle's Sherlock and Watson i've come across yet. The only problem i sometimes have is deciphering a series of fast-moving events supposed to reflect Sherlock's stream of deduction...but i enjoy rewatching them precisely to get a grip on the show...Love the character of Holmes and the actor...Watson is a great foil as he's meant to be.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This show just continues to bring excellent writing, acting and direction together for an always satisfying delivery.<br />Watch and fall in love.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Got very addicting on each level. Better than most escape games I ever played. Can't wait to finish it off.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Nice episode - it's very intriguing sci fi - and interesting characters<br />It does feel a bit too small as a cast at certain point though
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't stop watching it. Very addictive. Interesting, emotional, surprising!!! My new favorite show can't wait for the next season. A must see all three seasons.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I rented this and watched it with my 7 year old daughter. We both liked it and would like to buy it.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Lag free? MY A**. The lag is HORRIBLE on these headsets.<br />It also disconnects every few minutes.<br />Totally unsatisfied with this product.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|I thought it was pretty good, but very odd. my Daughter thought the same as I did. (Amazon, quit making me type so many words just to fill this up... or I won't do any more reviews)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I requested this book from my library a million years ago and only recently got a notice that it was my turn in the digital queue.  I don't even remember where I had found out about the book or what had convinced me to actually put in the effort to request it.  I downloaded it to my Kindle and started into it timidly.  Befor long, I was hooked and at every turn, raged and was outraged along with and/against the two main anti-heroes of the story.  Oops, I might have said too much there.  In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed this book in a way that I haven't a book in a really long time.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Tom is one of my fav. actors. So I'll watch anything he's in. This was good but at times hard to follow. It's one of those movies you'll find yourself thinking about for days.
B000002IAS|4.0|EC was never able to hide in a band situation despite trying more than a few times. This was the least appealing attempt because you can hear the man wanting to break free. Still, it lead to Derek in the Dominoes and so is a vital part of blues rock history.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This story is rotted in reality and that's what makes it great. Hold your breath, take warning, and live with hope.
B000001EEN|5.0|How could a live concert featuring names like Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ronnie Wood, Pete Townshend and Rick Grech be disappointing? It can't and it didn't.<br /><br />Featuring all the classics this is almost an embarrassment of riches. I can't recommend this highly enough.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I thought the movie looked great, and the storyline was interesting, but it was a little long and could be a little boring at times.  The monkey was hilarious though!
B000056JYB|5.0|Wonderful band, beautiful songs, great expression. Shame they only did it once. The Deluxe Editions has an insight into the where the band were heading next and two wonderful renditions of sleeping in the ground - a classic from their live concert at Hyde Park.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I liked the New take on the old tale of Jack and the Bean Stalk.  My kids really liked it as well.  The giants and the land they come from looked great.  It was an exciting and somewhat terrifying adventure!
B006M4F67A|4.0|If you like Mahjong games you will like these. The different choices are all very different and entertaining and fun.
B00B780TAK|2.0|The constant sever ups and downs of the series make it more a soap opera than a dignified drama. Such a plain formula of death, rebound, death, rebound, death rebound. I thought this was a more 'realistic' series about changing times. Instead it's much closer to Game of Thrones.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Got it for my husband for fathers day and he loves it. He has been a long time fan. And cd sounds great!!!
1451695195|5.0|I have read many books about NDE (Near Death Experiences) and this is excellent!  I have recommended it to several people and even have had Doctor friends recommend it to me.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was the first anime movie I'd ever watched.  It pretty much grabbed me right from the start  and got me onto all the others I've seen since.  The art is beautiful, the story is fascinating, and the message is inspirational.  On a side note, Kodama are the cutest little things ever.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Use the Amazon coins the first time you get 500 for FREE I SAID IT FRee ;) hmmm {: :P I got it free with my own 500 I have a lot more not free games thoe
B000BT97AO|5.0|I love this movie because it tickles my artistic fancy.<br />If ever I were to fall into a world created by myself, I would only hope it was as imaginative.<br />Anyone with difficulty keeping an open mind should go elsewhere.<br />I suppose I could compare this film to Pans Labyrinth or Bridge to Terabithia.. But Mirror Mask of course, is it's own movie entirely.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This is the fifteenth time I've read this book. Fourteen times with the school library's copy and once on my Kindle copy. I absolutely love it!!!
034554398X|5.0|Fabulous storyline, gripping reading with believable & multi-flawed characters - George shows why he's one of my 3 favourite authors.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing games. This game is fun and excited. It is also addicted, once you start playing it's hard to stop.
0345535421|5.0|Fabulous storyline, gripping reading with believable & multi-flawed characters - George shows why he's one of my 3 favourite authors.
034580404X|5.0|This is a great book!!! Every woman should read it!!! I must warn you one you start reading it you will not put it down!!
055358202X|5.0|Fabulous storyline, gripping reading with believable & multi-flawed characters - George shows why he's one of my 3 favourite authors.
B004UID2LC|3.0|There were a few kinks, but overall, it was pretty darn decent. The ads only got on the way when you click them. This is a great app for the Kindle Fire. I recommend it to YouTube lovers.
B00012QLQ4|5.0|Love the concept! Love the movie! Have always and will always! What a brilliant piece of celluloid! Would buy it a million times.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It is a creative game with lots of adventures. It can be a challenge for some but you will figure it out
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie claims to be based on a true story, but everything about it is such cliched hokum it seems more of a typical Hollywood adventure story (but an entertaining one). I don't mind a \\"last-second save\\" every now and then, but do we need three of them (the reservation on the computer at the last possible second, the crucial phone picked up just as the caller is about to hang up, the cars on the field just as the planer is taking off) in the space of fifteen or so minutes? It's all typical Hollywood stuff, as is the scene where Ben Affleck hatches his scheme while watching \\"Planet of the Apes\\" (just the way Newton conceived of gravity when an apple fell on his head!) And of course we have to see Aflleck return to his estranged wife to  make the happy ending complete. There are no really interesting characters here and the acting is stiff. (Alan Arkin and John Goodman are added to give a little desperately-needed color to the cast.) Still it was entertaining, though the critical acclaim is hard to comprehend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Defiantly keeps you challenged the levels get harder and more frustrating  I love it<br />Not a simple search and find your clues are very humorless I mean who's to say the paper goes in the slot to het the key. Very random
B00797MB0O|5.0|Target audience are those who have been out of high school for a while.  Great movie about a selfish woman, used to getting anything and anyone she wanted, putting all her wiles to work to get back the man of her dreams.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I don't have to wait for weather on tv,just have to touch my sunshine,there it is every time. So far it's been right in the money. Love it.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Like this type of game. It's good to play to kill time. Nice grAphics. Don't need internet  connection or friends to play.
0811870413|3.0|The bread tends to be heavy, nice reading but not the best recipe book I have ever used. Good for information though
B00AFEY354|3.0|I've been advising my friends to rent this movie rather than buy it, since it definitely has it's faults. Since it was directed and adapted for the screen by the author of the book, it retains much of the flavor of the book. The viewer feels Charlie's awkwardness and Patrick's freedom with himself. However, Emma Watson in the role of Sam is the strangest casting choice I have ever seen. She cannot pull off an American accent and her weird blend of British/attempted Pennsylvanian accent is distracting. I'm a huge Emma Watson fan - I live in Pennsylvania, and it just wasn't believable and she wasn't outgoing enough. If you can get over that, you will definitely enjoy the movie. It touches on growing up, tragedy, finding yourself - all the good elements of a coming-of-age story.
B00846REIS|1.0|Was this written for a high school student or what? What the heck is all the hype about? There must be 1,000 books out there that are written better. The sex is laughable and making a point to use contraceptives? High school
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is easily a favorite of mine. I love the smooth graphics and artwork. It's very well designed and the sounds are well done too. Game play is fun and easy; takes only a few minutes to get into the action. I definitely know why this game gets so much attention. It's really that good! I've yet to come across other games in the app store that will compare. I trust a company that produces quality games, and everything works on my device. I can play this game for hours. I love the quick progression of levels, but yet the difficulty can really get you. There are places that I can't get past, but it's still fun to try. Very good game, and highly recommended.
160774273X|5.0|I would trade in all my other bread books for this one. The recipes are easy to read with both weight and cup measurements. The recipes work!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a very useful application for the well known auction site. I love how everything is displayed and arranged. Item photos are very good even on the smaller screens of tablets. Everything is very well thought out, and easy to use. Easy to make purchases, leave feedback etc... I have had no issues with the app at all. I only wish it would remember my login information. Highly recommended!
B000A0K2JO|1.0|Dave explained this well on another product page...<br />  \\"OK, folks, listen up. There are two kinds of USB - PS/2 adapters. There's this kind, which simply changes one plug for another. It doesn't do any signal processing at all - it's just a dumb plug changer. For most of you, this will not work, because in order to use a PS/2 keyboard with a USB plug in the back of your computer, your adapter needs to change the signal somewhat. That's why you see the more expensive adapters - about $12 to $15. Those have circuitry inside them that actually changes the PS/2 output of your keyboard into a signal that the USB input of your computer will recognize. I learned this the hard way, too.\\"<br /><br />That's why they call this a \\"replacement connector\\", as in you bought a USB+PS/2 keyboard and it came with one of these.  This product page is misleading because it implies it converts USB to PS/2 format, which it does not.  Look on the keyboard box; it should say USB and PS/2 compatible.  If it doesn't, this connector won't work.<br /><br />The PS/2 to USB converters that Dave mentions actually cost about $90.  So if your keyboard is USB only and you want to plug it into a PS/2 port, then it's far better to just buy a new PS/2 or USB+PS/2 keyboard.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I remember reading that when this movie was being written, whoever owns the rights to the Wizard of Oz refused to allow them to use most of the familiar references from the original movie, such as most of the main characters, etc.  They only had a little leeway regarding some minor characters and places.  This pretty much sums up that whoever has those rights wasn't very confident in the script to warrant a thumbs-up.<br /><br />James Franco plays a sleezy snake oil salesman style phony &#34;magician&#34; in the beginning sequence which is in black and white (somehow I think he was playing himself more than he might care to admit).  Not to toss spoilers, so let's just say through familiar means he winds up in OZ and is deemed a savior of sorts and is expected to free them from the evil witch who now controls the Emerald City along with her Sister, who starts off nice but, well....<br /><br />The acting is what you'd expect for a movie such as this, and the special effects borderline on Disney animation at times, but along the sometimes drawn-out long way, you do pick up a few bits and pieces that explain a little of the background of some of the characters that were never explored in the original movie.  Kids can sit through a lot... adults will wish about 15 minutes of this movie were cut out.<br /><br />Overall a &#34;decent&#34; movie.  If you're stuck at home with the kids for a rainy weekend I could see making this the first of a double play, showing the original after this one, to piece things together for them.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't recommend the Century Trilogy too highly, although I'm not sure where Follett will go in book 3. With the dramatic events leading up to and through the two World Wars, much of the rest of the century could seem anti-climactic. But to the matter at hand - I strongly recommend reading Fall of Giants first, because it introduces many characters that appear in both books, and little background is given in Winter of the World.<br /><br />There are a number of detailed reviews, so I won't re-invent the wheel - I will just say that these two books have greatly increased my understanding of events that I knew about from school and other novels. (Book 3 will cover events I lived through, which could make it even more intriguing).<br /><br />One reviewer rightly complained about the $20+ Kindle price; by the time I bought it, it was down to $18. Fall of Giants was under $12, but I got it some time after it was first published. So start with that one, then read another dozen of Follett's books, and maybe the price will drop even more. If it does not, it is still well worth the price.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fantastic thought provoking game. Love it and can't wait for more rooms. In the beginning I thought it was going to be easy but each level got harder. Enjoyed how u had to think things thru and sometimes had to backtrack your steps to actually move forward.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I have no idea how many times I've seen this movie, but I never get tired of it.  There is always something new I see when I watch it that I didn't notice before.  Jimmy Stewart & Grace Kelly are so entertaining & perfectly suited for their roles, along with all the other actors.  If you like Alfred Hitchcock movies, this one is a must-see!
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|Did not care for the ending!  This season three was a disappointment compared to previous seasons.  May not view again.
B002O3Z506|5.0|Christopher Reeve WAS superman.  Really.  How could he not be?  I saw this first as a child in the movie theater, & just recently with my children.  They loved it & are still talking about it.  It never loses its appeal.  If you've never seen this classic, see it soon, & share it with your kids!
B005ES0Z9O|5.0|nice crocs. seems like the soles may last longer because of the thicker tread. same consistent sizing as the classic cayman crocs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love how the author puts so much detail into the story and how the tension builds very fast.<br />I would recommend this book to readers who love lots of action, drama, and suspense.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Excellent book. It was a little hard to understand the Latin,but otherwise a great novel. You should definitely read the next books if you liked this one. \\"Joshua, age 11.\\"
B007EW9ISM|5.0|i use iAnnotate to take notes on PDFs in class, and this stylus is perfect for that app on my iPad 3rd generation. I would highly recommend this stylus, even though i have not tried others - this does the job i need and I am fairly picky!
159463176X|4.0|This book was not as compelling as the other two books I read by Hosseini.  It was a little difficult to follow the frequent changes in time and place.
B0093LINT2|2.0|Performance and mainboard sockets are the same as the other current model (as of 6/2013). The difference between the two models is the I/O, with this model featuring Thunderbolt.  The problem is the Thunderbolt currently only supports video and, as such, is equivalent to a mini-displayport (from which Thunderbolt evolved, BTW).  The port does not support an external disk drive or any other Thunderbolt-aware device, other than a video monitor. If higher-speed I/O is required, I recommend that one wait for the next generation due out any month now. This and many other issues have been addressed including better port complements such as USB3. The new model also addresses the heat issue by means of employing the new Haswell CPU, way cool (literally)!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I do almost all of my reading for pleasure (99%) on Kindle (Fire) and sometimes, I will pick a book based on how I like the cover. Sometimes it's  the hook. Lord knows the customer reviews have regularly let me down.<br /><br />Call it instinct, call it kismet, call it whatever you like. This time it paid off. It was clearly well researched, and I did appreciate that, as it moved the story forward in a realistic way. But for me, the character development was king. I went back to this book time and time again to find out how they were, if they were okay, if there was hope. The end left me with a sense of satisfaction that all was at it should be with the people that lived inside the pages.<br /><br />At first I felt that the writing had an amateurish quality, but upon reflection, I realize that it was the main character's innocent view of things, and the timid approach she took in living her life. It was not the writing, it was Louisa's voice/point of view.<br /><br />I liked this enough to read another: &#34;The Last Letter From Your Lover&#34;. It was a significant departure  in terms of plot, the characters, setting and  time period....but that quality...that hard to name something that identifies the author, telling you this is one of their works was there. Even if this has been written under a pen name, I believe that I would have been able to name it as a Jo Jo Moyes piece.<br /><br />I will be reading all of her other work as it becomes available.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Im an avid Rolling Stones fan, and an avid memoirs reader and an avid history of music fan.The stories about my favorite band are priceless. Where the songs came from, the creative process, how the influences of those before them made an impact and moved their actions and their hearts. For any fan, reading how much of a fan your idol is, its very touching.<br /><br />If you like the Stones, I cant recommend this enough. If you are interested in life in the sixties-seventies, also it is a good read. We all love to know about the lives of other people, ( so much realities this days) so, reading about someone with all the excesses in the most excessive years of time, this is great.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I became a fan late in the game and am so thankful Amazon Prime has season 2 and 3 available for streaming!
B004QX07G4|2.0|I think this book is good for gift, especially for teens. It is funny and it isn offensive or inappropriate. However, I didnt enjoy it as I thought I would. I prefer her other books better.
B00CX1TSSO|2.0|Due to the fact that I wasn't paying attention (I only wanted to watch the trailer) I wound up buying this (non-HD).<br />I haven't checked the return policy, but I'm pretty sure you can't be reimbursed for a mistake in the digital realm.<br />So I'm stuck with a movie I didn't want and wouldn't have gotten if I'd been paying attention.<br />I enjoyed the HD version that I did get on purpose, though.
B00CXS55LG|5.0|I've only known of this band for a couple months, but I've had a hard time taking this record out of rotation since I started listening to it. It satisfies my taste for noisy, raucous metal (Deafheaven is, to oversimplify, a black metal outfit), and also my desire for gorgeous, consonant harmonies. It's just great. And the drummer! Just out of control, in the best way possible. Highly recommended.
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|The kindle version is very good. So far no typos, good formatting. The works are in chronological order so you can read straight through or navigate to a specific work. And of course Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is incredible. Read his books! You won't be able to put them down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging Fun and thoughtful game. I look forward to the next challenge.  If you like solving puzzles you will enjoy this game.  This game for old and young.  It is somewhat addictive.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a great game to play if you want to just relax and unwind after a long day
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie 1st and loved it. The book is way better.  You root for Pat and Tiffany the whole way through. It's a must read!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Best and simplest of all calculators I have used! The only drawback is it cannot change TV channels! Bring it to work everyday-and I am an accountant!
B000001FMC|5.0|I am just a fan.  I can not be impartial in a review.  I wont more CD's and tours from Swing out Sister.  Lost voices of the eighties.
B004UA8D2S|5.0|I know the media had some poor things to say about this movie, but I loved it.  The acting at times was a little cheesy and predictable, but if you like diving and the water in general you easily look past its shortcomings.  I watch it regularly...
0553103547|5.0|Buy all of this series now and read it.  Watch the series on HBO but you will have missing so much.  What is fun is to try and figure out how they can produce this great series for the unwashed masses.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Top-notch writing, casting, directing, production, character development and plot/subplots with a very high degree of realism plus historical elements that contribute to the overall substance of the series!<br /><br />Only one cautionary note:  If you tend to watch your favorite shows at night (rather than in the early evenings), be careful of this particular series:  My wife and I have an early morning wake-up time; in our first viewing session of Season 1 we watched the first three episodes back-to-back.  The resulting loss of precious sleep inspired us the next day to implement a One-Episode-Per-Night rule, which we have since violated only once on a weekend.<br /><br />Season 3 builds on the strengths of 1 and 2, and the rule continues to work well for us, especially in light of the increased temptation to \\"sneak in just one more\\" before bedtime!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|These are good song with her personal style.  We all know where she is coming from and the music world has recognized it.
B005V1WYZC|5.0|It is the best romantic comedy I've seen in years! I love to be surprised and this movie does just that--over and over again.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Heard him on SNL and I like the band theme.  Now I keep sing the songs in my head.  Kind of reminds me of the 70's.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This one got me hooked. I started downloading others, fee or free. Had a good time with this and it was free. Looking forward to others.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I was looking for a hub to carry around with my Surface Pro since it only has one USB 3.0 port. The Surface Pro is small like a tablet so any kind of USB 4-port hub that required a AC adapter would be too bulky since I already carry around the Surface Pro power adapter with it.<br />In comes the Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 4-Port Compact Hub to the rescue and it fit the job just fine.  I can now attach multiple items to my Surface Pro: my phone, a USB stick, an external HD, etc. all at the same time!  I also ran some tests copying large quantities of data(about 1GB of photos/videos transferred from my phone to my Surface Pro via the Anker Uspeed USB hub and it worked just as fast as if it was connected directly.  I also had multiple external hard drives connected at the same time so its performance seemed to be solid!<br />The hub is really light and portable so it barely takes up any space in the pocket of the neoprene case for my Surface Pro.<br />I'm happy with the purchase and highly recommend it if you are looking for a hub that does not require AC power.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love the show, but at $1.99 for each episode, I'll wait for the DVD to come out at Walmart.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Good story and good acting, but it moved surprisingly slowly in many parts. It isn't Gone With the Wind, but it is still above average movie entertainment.
B00B9J05CO|3.0|Limited number of sound bites, I would guess this a first attempt to devolpe an app and get is on the market.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Bought this to move a FireWire drive to a new iMac with no FireWire ports. Have had no issues, so far.
B0065FIHYA|5.0|Great movie. Awesome visuals. Never seen a black n white film look so colorful. Will definitely recommend this to my friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|one of the best horse games I've played!! the quality is good and its great that you are able to care forbyour own horse and compete as well!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a super fun yet challenging puzzle game!  Love escaping the levels! I can't wait for more!! I hope they're coming soon!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Nothing to say, works as expected, just want to rate it with stars and move on to something else.  So...
B005T87QCI|5.0|yes I know what you're looking at people (hey Zeus and Atom aren't there)! yes they are,store in the main menu derr  and there is a create your own robot i know what you're thinking Zeus and Atom shouldn't  cost money  ( my opinion that is Liam) i rate it 5 stars because i think it's AMAZING!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game. It'll keep you guessing. Some floors were fairly easy but I enjoyed it.  Can't wait for more floors.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I liked it and so did my kids. I hate doing reviews but i will do it for one time only.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I wanted to read this book before the movie came out and even tho it wasn't what I expected, it was still really good.  It was very different than a lot of other zombie books.  I can't wait to see the movie!
0316212377|5.0|Ian Banks at his best, revealing his flaws, maybe to add to the delight.  The clear weakness, the quizlt seem no more ready for sublimation than current humans, certainly less ready than the average super intelligent and ancient culture ship mind.  So why other than hubris?  We are told that a previous race of sublimators have fooled them into believing in godhood.  Though at the last minute they return to let them have it straight.  Not that it matters.  Sublimation is the real deal.  Clear folly implied, especially since sublimation, by strong implication, is not really necessary to venture into the outer dimensions encompassed by sublimation space.  By the premise, the single requirement, a mass duplication of the current set of individual intelligences of the quizlt into their outer dimensional analogues, is easily accomplished with their advanced tech.  Why such advanced tech exists for such a race of bumpkins is not convincingly explained.  They seem to have gotten it and then en masse become luddites.  They could just go on in the current universe while their duplicates sublimate into the infinite, or whatever one does on the other side of normal four space, in all those extra dimensions just waiting for another mass exodus from the 4D.  But no, in the end they hold hands while their mysterious machines \\"enfold\\" them away.  We never get to really meet these machines, other than vague descriptions of collective ghost minds on their warships, in general far inferior to the \\"culture\\" ship minds, which act more like Olympian Gods than a real omnipotent, western style, transcendent beings.  In the end, in contradiction to the premise, the dimensions of the sublime can swallow up a continuous consciousness as if it were a transmutable fluid, a presence external to its computational substrate.  The sublimated beings \\"cross over\\" and back at their whim.  Clearly their fluid of consciousness has transcended to true outer dimensional ambrosia.  This is not the way it is in our real, 4D, world, the author takes pains to explain.  Apparently sublimation space manages to merge Descartes' duality.  A contradiction and a copout. It is not convincing that the author intends this as irony.  Feels more like a comic book explanation, simply hand waving, extreme literary license.  At least he should be internally consistent.
