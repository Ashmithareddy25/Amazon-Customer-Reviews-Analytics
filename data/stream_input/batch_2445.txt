B00BF123WG|5.0|I was impressed with how the movie showed how all the pieces fit together: the combination of the CIA intel with the special forces operation, and showed the debates about the course of action at every stage.  It was much more nuanced than I expected.  IMHO Kathryn Bigelow deserves a lot of credit.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I wanted to have a movie to watch with my little 5 year old girl and she loved this.  would recommend.
B005ETA5K2|3.0|Had problems getting this to work correctly and had to get rid of driver with the power control to adjust transmit power. Also replaced usb cable that came with adapter and that may have helped. Down loaded latest driver for windows 7 from alfa tw and its working ok. The reception not really better than cheaper adapters with my directional antenna but seems to work fast.
B001LM1456|5.0|my kids loved it, they had never watched any of the Hulk movies or heard about the character.  would recommend it
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Having read Marc Eliot's biography of the Eagles and Don Felders biograpy, I was really looking forward to this documentary.  Many of the details were glossed over or left out, as is necessary for a several hour movie, but the inclusion of personal interviews and clips of the Eagles making music resulted in me grinning from ear-to-ear for the entire duration of the first disc.<br /><br />The 7-song, Hotel California era concert DVD by itself is worth the cost of the 3-disc set.  This was the Eagles at their height with the classic line-up: Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Randy Meisner, Don Felder & Joe Walsh, and it's actually scary how GOOD they were!  In Eliot's book, Glyn Johns is quoted as disliking The Eagles as a rock band and didn't want to record them unti he heard them doing four-part (when there were just four of them) harmonies, to which he exclaimed, \\"that is what this band is all about!\\".  He was absolutely correct and the concert footage highlights their vocal skills.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in The Eagles or in music biographies in general.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have watched the series Bones since its inception and appreciate the details, relationship between law, medicine and science, and the fact that my husband, a crime scene investigator and supervisor, doesn't tear the show to pieces as we watch making comments regarding what is possible vs what isn't. This is the first time I've seen one of Reich's novels, and couldn't resist. Though different from the TV version of Temperance Brennan, I still connected and enjoyed her character. Well written, good humour, nice light read.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|This is great since this is a great combo with a great sounding live cd and also includes SOS's first official live DVD ever...definitely a treat. And yes they have a zillion other songs that are even better than Breakout for those not in the know and asking!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|While this is a story of total fiction it is good read to see how a bright & motivated individual can outwit the various federal law enforcement agencies. The unexpected developments occurring in the last 1/3 of the story adds to the enjoyment of this read.

193700788X|1.0|I shared this review on Goodreads, so rather than reinventing the wheel:<br /><br />Dear Ms. Harris,<br /><br />I refuse to read this book. I did not read Deadlocked and I will not read this one. I have no clue what would possess you to alienate your fans like this, but that is exactly what you did.<br /><br />You wonder why we all love Eric? You wonder why we all wanted Eric and Sookie to have a HEA? You wrote the books, you created the characters, you created the arc, the narrative, and we followed you for 13 years. You managed to destroy their story in the last three books. After the bond was broken that was it for me. I decided Book 11 would be the last book I would read in this series.<br /><br />I am so upset by the ending of this series that I refuse to read the last two books. I will turn to fanfiction and pretend this nightmare never occurred.<br /><br />Eric Northman will forever be a beloved character. I wish I could say the same for Sookie. You managed to make me dislike your heroine. You could have had Sookie end up alone, but instead you put her with a character she has shown ZERO interest in since Book 1. Not only that, but you have her banished from Eric for 200 years. So not only did you split them up, but you did it for all eternity.<br /><br />I am so shocked by this ending. I feared it, I thought it, but I never thought it would come to fruition.<br /><br />To have invested 13 years in a series to feel this duped by the author is devastating.<br /><br />I'm not sure the SVM community will ever recover from this. No wonder you decided not to tour with this book.<br /><br />I know people say that these are your books and your characters and I couldn't agree more. Having said that, why even introduce us to Eric Northman? Why make us fall in love with him if in the end all you were going to do is destroy him? Why write 13 books only to end up where we began? I am so confused I cannot see straight.
193700788X|1.0|I didn't think that there could be a bigger cop out, in terms of an ending to a much beloved series, than the Harry Potter epilogue. I was completely wrong. This is by far the number one book on that list now. I feel totally robbed & slightly betrayed by CH. She chose the easy way out, the mundane & predictable route, for the simple reason that she could not be bothered to put any effort into this book creatively; and it shows on every single one of the book's three-hundred-odd pages. Even the most crucial of plot points came to the most laughably boring resolutions CH has ever written.<br /><br />There was no depth to any of the characters, so much so that even all the major players in the series came off almost unrecognizable to me & I consider myself a devoted fan, an extremely thorough reader & re-reader--and one that made sure to re-read the entire series right prior to the release of DEA. Yes, Sookie does come full circle: she began as a back-woods barmaid and she ends up right back where she started. I felt like all of her growth as a character and as a woman was thrown out the window in order to accommodate the ending, which literally puts the reader back at square one.<br /><br />She \\"chooses\\" Sam (AKA defaults to him) even though we all thought Sookie understood from the very beginning that mixing business with pleasure was never a wise choice. Though this notion is repeated several times throughout the series & it would seem that Sookie would abide by this adage, especially since she ends up with a much larger stake in the bar as co-owner, she apparently has absorbed none of this. Sookie's apparent desire for a man with a \\"quiet\\" mind, another notion repeated on numerous occasions, also goes out the window even though she states explicitly in previous books that she could never be with a man who's mind she can read. Her sudden inability to properly read the thoughts of shifters, even though she was perfectly capable of it in all the other books, was employed merely to accommodate the ending. CH knew the readers would never believe a Sookie that chooses Sam while a relationship with Eric is still viable so she conveniently squeezes Eric between a rock & a hard place and completely tears-to-shreds the integrity of her most imaginative character by-far, all to force the ending of the series into some farce of plausibility. Not to mention the enormous number of details regarding Sookie & Eric's relationship throughout the series that were just plain forgotten so that CH could make room for Sam...<br /><br />Almost all of this book's characterizations felt completely non sequitur in comparison to the characterizations that were premised during the overall arc of the story, especially in regard to Sookie and Eric, for whom CH didn't bother doing any justice. Their interactions in this book were more indicative of two characters that hardly knew each other and dated only casually. What happened to everything that happened between them while Eric was cursed? What happened to the blood bond and their vampire marriage? To the numerous times they saved each other's lives? Eric was hardly featured in this book and their communication almost nil, when Deadlocked revolved almost entirely around the relationship between Sookie & Eric...a relationship that has dominated the entire series--therefore the majority of Sookie's dating life--and she suddenly doesn't give a damn that Eric is marrying another woman in two weeks?!<br /><br />Sookie has never been casual about sex, yet she has sex with Sam right after her marriage is dissolved and even considers sleeping with Bill?! Sookie broke her blood bond to Eric to ensure that her feelings weren't being manipulated by magic, but somehow she can't care that the Cluviel Dor's magic manipulated into being her romantic feelings for Sam? Sookie even sounds utterly ambivalent about Sam at the end of the book, like she couldn't be bothered about whether her relationship with him will even exist in the future; and according to this final book she and Eric only had what apparently turned out to be a degenerating relationship that revolved mainly around both parties pride and mutual need for vengeance in the end. Somehow we, as your readers, are supposed to swallow all of this and believe it too? Yes CH is free to do whatever she wants with her own characters, but please don't insult the intelligence of your readers and then call us entitled for it.<br /><br />I can't believe that I actually get watery-eyed whenever I randomly catch myself thinking about this book, even though I knew what was coming since CH went with the most obvious of all her plot devices on this one--which btw, was so glaringly in-your-face during the last couple of books that I had blissfully convinced myself that it was nothing more than a red-herring since CH does like to twist things up quite often. I obviously gave the woman too much credit too soon. Absolutely no plot twists to save this one though. I'm not sure I even have the proper words to sum up everything that I'm feeling because Sookie & I have been friends for what I consider many years now, but I am ashamed to admit that the overwhelming emotion feels genuinely like grief. CH has made me feel like such an a** for investing my time, money, and emotions in these books to only have the series end this way.<br /><br />I honestly think I might hate Sookie now, which is what I believe CH wanted in the end so that she would not and could not be forced to write more in or about the Sookie-verse. I'm heartbroken because the Southern Vampire Mysteries series was one I followed lovingly for quite a length of time. I never in my wildest dreams thought I would say this, but thank goodness for the fact that True Blood does not follow the plot-line of the books. I'm literally crossing all my fingers and toes hoping that the True Blood writers will take pity on all the Eric fans & give us, as well as Eric, the kind of resolution we bothdeserve after everything we've been through together, regardless of the outcome of his relationship with Sookie.<br /><br />If I, as a reader, wanted a \\"realistic\\" human relationship as a conclusion, then I simply would not have picked up a supernatural mystery novel full of demons, faeries, werewolves, and vampires. What happened to the idea that love conquers all regardless of all the seemingly insurmountable obstacles? There is not an ounce of the magic in this book that so endeared me to the early books in this series. And to those criticizing the readers that gave strongly negative reviews about the book (including CH herself), it's not whining, it's called giving a heartfelt opinion, which is exactly what writing a review is about. The vast majority of Sookie fans have no intentions of harming CH or themselves to get her attention. Yes, the characters and story do belong to CH and she is free to use both to whatever end she wishes; but if she didn't want an intense reaction from her readers, then she should have kept these characters to herself instead of sharing them with us for more than a decade and expecting us not to have such strong opinions about them.<br /><br />CH completely expected this reception from the majority of her fans and she's getting exactly what she knew she was in for. Even though the reaction to this book was obvious to CH long beforehand, she probably couldn't fathom the reality of it--which has most likely been much worse than anything even she expected. Mrs. Harris, that is exactly how all of your devoted Sookie & Eric fans feel about the way you chose to end the series. The outcome is painfully obvious beforehand, but still unfathomable in it's reality and utterly worse than expected. Plain & simple, please cut the \\"entitled readers\\" some slack if you expect some in return.

193700788X|1.0|I am beyond disappointed. Eric Northman is my favorite male fictional character of all times, coming from a lifetime of reading that is a huge statement for me.  Eric has always been such a wonderful, charismatic, sexy, and brilliant specimen of male.  This book made him seem like a sulky pea brained brat.  He did not have to wind up with Sookie to make me happy, he just needed to exit gracefully.  He was not given the respect that he deserved, because lets face it we bought the books and stuck through all that stupid fairy crap because of Eric.  And come to find out another book comes out in October \\"After Dead\\" or something that tells you the future of all the characters. Hello! You are supposed to put in that crap in the final novel of the series.  I will never buy another Charlaine Harris book again.  I understand if you got tired of writing it, but as a very loyal fan to many book series I would have waited. I would have taken less books, if it meant the quality was there and just been thankful.  I felt like Claude had a more noble exit than Eric and he was a freaking villain.  Pam and Eric would never have parted without even a lovely goodbye.  Who the heck cared about revisiting Arlene or all the other nonessential characters she drug up? You do not have to the ending I would have liked in order to make me like and respect your finale, but you do have to write a character that is consistent with the on I was introduced to and fell in love. Sure characters evolve, but that's the key part they change for better or worse they don't just get a lobotomy and turn into a dull zombie resemblance of what they used to be.  What was that mess with Sam & Sookie, it seemed so shallow. She even wrote that Sookie would be just fine if they broke up. What was the point, why not just say it was a booty call? There are a lot of series that I love that didn't end the way I would have picked, but I loved them because they showed respect and honor to the essence of that particular book. Like JK Rowling, Harry should have been with Hermione yet I loved the final book in the Harry Potter series.  The tone and flow of this book was so vastly different from the earlier books in this series, I question if it was even written by Charlaine.  I'll just have to dream up a better ending for Eric on my own I guess. I'm sad for not only myself, but all of the other former fans. We deserved better!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'd give the author two stars on her story telling technique, but her imagination raises it to three. I realize she is writing to a young audience, but does she have to dumb it down it so much?<br />The characters aren't particularly believable. The horrors are imaginative, but not fleshed out enough to be really scary. The scenes lack content and life. I couldn't picture the settings based on her lack of descriptions.<br />I think a good screenwriter and director could improve on the material significantly as they did in the movie version of The Hunger Games. I look forward to seeing it on the Screen.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I would have given this product SIX stars because there are SIX awesome movies but five will suffice. The package came to me on-time according to the delivery forecast. I purchased this for a marathon on May the fourth.  I would definitely recommend this saga to any fan or non fan :)
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Loved the first and second books, did not love this one. It felt like a cop out, completely rushed with no wrap up at the end. Very disappointed...

Well done, Motorhead!!!!BRAVO!!!
B00499K9E0|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, what with the modern setting and all.  And Bilbo Baggins.  But I was pleasantly surprised!  Sherlock as a character reminds me a bit of Dr. House.  He seems to be a borderline sociopath who cares little for people or tact, but really loves the fascination of a good mystery.  Watson in this series seems to add a bit of balance.  He also seems to like the mystery and continues to aid Sherlock in his investigations.<br /><br />The first season has three episodes, though all are about 90 minutes.<br /><br />It's the second best British detective series I've seen in the last few years.  After Foyle's War of course.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Watch episode one.  If you're not hooked by the end, then you won't like the series.  Chances are that you will be hooked!
B000002IRL|5.0|HORRORSCOPE is one of the best THRASH albums EVER!!!!! All the songs are great like COMA, BLOOD MONEY, INFECTIOUS, BARE BONES and the title track!!!!!!!!if you like the old THRASH style, you will love this HEAVY pearl!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nothing funny at all in it.<br /><br />If anyone suggests that you should watch this movie, perform self taught root canal on yourself without an anesthetic instead.  It will be less painful.<br /><br />Amazon's ratings won't let me give it a zero or negative, one star is the worst I can give it.  It doesn't even deserve that.
0316286850|5.0|I had replaced this book after someone had borrowed it years ago and still I learn from it as I did all those years ago, make up looks recycle it seems every 20 yrs.
193700788X|2.0|Makes me sad the last few books didn't keep me interested like the first part of the series, which I DEVOURED. I loved the characters and story lines but it seems as though once season 2 of the tv show aired the writing changed.  I only read the last 3 books to see what happened with Eric and I could only scan this one because I couldn't bring myself to read the whole book.  I can't believe I'm actually SAD about a book series but I used to LOVE this series and I actually care about the characters so it sucks to see how it ended.  I wish the series was finished before the tv show started.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't usually read a thiller or mystery but this one was capitvating and suspenseful. I thought that the style of showing both characters inner monologue was well done and really gave the reader that omnipresence in a story that keeps twisting and surprising.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|I actually looked a lot a lot a LOT LOT!!! of different watches on eBay/Amazon reviews/etc before I actually bought this watch.  The only negative comments about this watch was that the face was too small and that it loses a few seconds of time over a few days.  I know it's a men's watch (I'm female), but I was not liking the trend that women's automatic watches are HUGE.  I have a very slim wrist and I didn't want a watch that the face wouldn't even sit flat on my wrist.  So the small face was not an issue for me.  My boyfriend has a regular-type man-wrist, and he tried it on, and it looked more casual on him than on me because of the size difference.  I work at a desk and I am always concerned I'll scratch it on the desk or bang it into something, I haven't had any issues with it yet.  I like simple designs, my last watch was very similar:  black, tells time, goes with everything, cloth band (metal bands rip my arm hair out!!), just what a needed.  The reason I got rid of my last watch?  The battery died.  This is my first automatic watch and I totally love it. I haven't noticed it losing time at all, and I take it off to sleep and it still is ticking away when I wake up.  (Like I said, I sit at a desk all day, so it's not like I'm shaking it up all the time to 'charge' it).  If you've never had an automatic before, I'd warn you about the weight-it's heavier than what I am use to, but after the first day, it was no longer noticeable.  The end of the band that is exposed is melted to keep it from fraying, and it catches on my clothes sometimes.  seriously, those are my only complaints, and I'm pretty picky about watches being functional, fairly priced, and fashionable.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|starship troopers trilogy and star ship invasion has lots and lots of sex in it not recommended for children under 18 and under has to be over 21 plus it has nudity and lots of curse words in it the movie is rated \\"R\\" not recommended for children but it is a good movie anyway
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|The interactive story is the perfect next step! Remember the Neverending Story when we were kids? How stuff in the book started being heard and felt as well as read by Christian? The experience of this little story brought that to mind so much. Any good story captivates adult and child, and this is a good story that comes to life, but more charming! have fun with it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cannot believe that this is the end of the book!  I did not want to put it down.  I understand that this is her first serious involvement and she probably thinks she should be walking on air.  If one is not used to the lifestyle he lives might be sort of hard to swallow. It does make one very aroused. I cannot wait to read the next book.  I am glad I purchased the other two books!
B0007939PM|5.0|How could you not consider this purchase..I wanted both movies and it was a double feature..it was cheaper to purchase this double feature than doing it individually..and the seller worked with Amazon..that sold me.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Looks great and has many options, although a fuller equalizer would be nice instead of just bass and treble.  Disappointed it gives slight feedback occasionally actually making the sound worse. Used it for my galaxy 2 phone and it does make the sound slightly better when no feedback occurs.  Also the cord from the E17 to the phone is pretty stiff, so hopefully it doesn't hurt the jack over time.  A much better upgrade for sound was getting noise cancelling headphones and they cost much less.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|His is a book that definitely knows its audience. The name dropping and geek lists would fly right over the heads of someone not already in the know. Meaning, it's very inclined to alienate anyone without adequate geek cred. For those that pass the tests though,
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It is the rue definition of a page turner. I've read many of Baladacci's books, this by far is his best. The characters are true and was to understand. The plot moves quick and is full of twists and turns. I would say that this book, and the winner are my top two books I've read in several years. If yiu like Clancy, or other action packed books, pick this one up, I am 100% certain you will not regret it!
0061726834|5.0|Delirium was a fantastic read. First, I love Lauren Oliver's writing style. Her descriptions carried me right into the heart of the story so that I felt as if I was there in Portland, living within the borders, both fearing and longing for the day of my procedure. The characters were believable and fleshed out, and I came to know them personally. Their personalities and descriptions were believable and I loved all of them: Hana, Alex, Gracie, and of course, Lena. She was a fabulous heroine. This is always a key quality for me in any book I read: character development. Lauren Oliver achieved this aspect with great skill. She also developed the character of the setting so well that I really connected with the feel of the city and the Crypts and the Wilds, and I know she will do a fantastic job developing the Wilds even further in Pandemonium.<br /><br />Alex was such a great character. He was smooth and smart and handsome, of course. Always a good thing to be. He was very likeable as Lena's love interest. Lauren developed their relationship at a good pace that didn't feel too rushed. I like that in a love story. There is nothing more disappointing than a couple moving from 0% to 100% in the first three chapters. This was refreshing and believable, and it felt right.<br /><br />The idea of \\"Love is a disease\\" was absolutely brilliant. So brilliant, that I'm a little jealous that she thought of the idea first. I was so impressed with how Lauren built up the concept, and I loved all the little excerpts from The Book of Shhh at the beginning of each chapter. This gave an extra, special spice to the story that I enjoyed so much. It allowed readers to see how completely conditioned this world and the people in it are. And the scariest part is that this story is not so far-fetched. I could see the U.S. closing the borders one day; it's not so unrealistic to imagine this. I could see martial law being instated; this, too, is not so far-fetched. The book is moving because it touches so closely on reality.<br /><br />The greatest message that Lauren sends us, however, is in her idea that there are those who cannot be tamed. Hence, the Wilds. And I love this most of all; that people truly can rise above oppression and tyranny and... socialism, and choose to do the right thing even when the world tries to convince them that it's wrong. This is what Alex and Lena stand for. And by the end of this series, I truly believe this is what Alex and Lena will do.<br /><br />Casey Hays<br />Author of [[ASIN:0988188007 The Cadence]]ouches so closely on reality.<br /><br />The greatest message that Lauren sends us, however, is in her idea that there are those who cannot be tamed.

B009NY43NY|5.0|This was a terrific series.  I was tempted to save the last book but couldn't do it in the end, and I'm glad.  The characters' stories are resolved in a way that was true to them and true to the world that the author created.  Mrs. Harris told us several years ago how things would play out, and anyone who thought it would go otherwise hasn't seen the integrity of this author, who writes as long as the characters have somewhere to go, and then stops.  I'm very grateful for that.<br /><br />Seems like the folks who have problems with how Mrs. Harris wrote her book should stop complaining and write their own series!

193700788X|1.0|I agree with so many of the other reviewers; it felt like Charlaine Harris simply gave up.  The last few books have been much more anti-climactic than when the series began.  However, this last book was simply terrible.  While I appreciated bringing in so many of the characters in the previous books, the book in its entirety was simply dreadful.

Actually, I do: I own more books than I will be able to read in my lifetime.<br /><br />As soon as I opened this book and saw that it was dedicated to Gene Kelly, I felt reaffirmed in my selection of reading material. I would never in a million years have guessed that Ray Bradbury would be singing Gene Kelly's praises, but there it was. I guess Bradbury and I were off to a good start.<br /><br />Something Wicked This Way Comes is about two boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshare, and their encounters with a traveling carnival that is far deeper than meets the eye. Once the carnvial's leaders realize that the boys are suspicious of their actions, they seek to silence them by whatever means necessary: bribery, terror, or maybe even death.<br /><br />When I started reading this book (which was on Halloween...it took me forever to finish it because I kept getting distracted by other books), I posted a tweet claiming that Bradbury \\"writes like a dream.\\" I usually use this phrase to mean \\"writes so darn well.\\" In this case, that's what I meant at first. But as I progressed through the novel, I realized that Bradbury's writing was also often dreamlike: sort of hazy, yet somehow beautifully descriptive. There are soft, touching moments as well as scenes filled with some of the creepiest suspense.<br /><br />Until about two-thirds of the way through, I couldn't wait to read more of Bradbury's work. My only complaint with this book is that at the end it gets sort of preachy -- not in a religious way, more allegorical, I guess. And while I enjoy a moral that's baked into the story, I don't like when it's slapped on top like icing on a cake, sitting on top of the action like a separate entity. (Note: The message in the story is a good one; it was just too overt for me.)<br /><br />All in all: I'd read Bradbury again for sure. I just hope that his works don't all read like cautionary tales.tity. (Note: The message in the story is a good one; it was just too overt for me.)<br /><br />All in all: I'd read Bradbury again for sure. I just hope that his works don't all read like cautionary tales.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a very interesting book about a life in an Irish orphanage, a very sad life. About a boy to man story who over came unspeakable times as a child and grew to a man who wanted to love and be loved.  A story to make you cry and laugh uncontrollably all by yourself.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|An amazing book. It kept me engaged the entire time. I can't wait to read the next book in the series
B009NY43NY|5.0|****SPOILERS****<br /><br />I'm perfectly fine with the way this series ended. That Sookie would end up with Sam as how I always thought the story would end. The characters of Sookie, Sam and Eric remained consistent throughout the series.<br /><br />Sam was always leaning towards Sookie, and I maintain that if Bill Compton had never come to Bon Temps, it would have been Sookie and Sam to begin with. Bill's arrival threw Sookie off the path she and Sam were on.<br /><br />Eric did what comes natural for Eric, which is looking out for his own interests. He never truly listened to or understood Sookie. If he had, he wouldn't have been surprised that she didn't want to be a vampire or be his mistress. I'm not surprised Sookie and Sam circled back to each other.<br /><br />It is true that Bill and Eric showed Sookie a larger and more magical world than the one that she had known. Sometimes, though, seeing the larger world makes you realize how much you love home. Sam was home. It was always going to be Sam.

193700788X|1.0|If you're looking for the northern Louisiana supernatural community you grew to know and love in the previous twelve books, put down this edition and make up your own ending. Plots from earlier books are recycled, some characters whose stories have been resolved keep popping up with no addition to the plot, and worst of all, one beloved character is thrown under the bus. And backed over, and ran over again and again for no discernible reason. I would not be surprised if the seemingly required sex scene made a list of \\"bad sex in books\\" this year. Was this truly the same author who wrote the earlier books?!<br /><br />I began reading these books between the 3rd and 4th installments. While the first 2 books were slow, the third one really opened a new door, and the fourth is seriously one of the best in this genre. Unfortunately, Charlaine Harris could not keep up the momentum. The story petered out around book 10, and unfortunately kept going for 3 more installments.<br /><br />As comments posted on her website and official Facebook page state, Ms. Harris believes that she should be above criticism regarding the way the story ended and in regards to characters behaving, well, out of character. When one decides to publish a book, however, they leave themselves open to the interpretation, feeling, and criticism of both readers and reviewers. Ms. Harris does have the right to end the book the way she wants to. However, if the majority of your fanbase is disgruntled and feels your characters have been forcibly warped to suit a predetermined ending, not to mention the various plot devices that were changed or simply dropped in order to make her ending fit... perhaps one should take this into consideration when writing future books.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I Love Harry Potter.. these movies are hours of entertainment that transports you to a world of magic & adventure!
B009T8XBBO|1.0|The in app purchases are getting ridiculous. This is one of the more expensive apps to begin with, then to be hit wit IAP'S is an insult. This developer didn't even think it was neccessary to let people know about it in the description. So basically, I feel the same as most other people here and refuse to let these developers have one cent of my money. There is no game out there worth paying for more than once.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a great time waster. I only wish it was a bit larger.  Mistakes.it a bit difficult to see
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|I love this movie, its just as great and memorable a tale as it was in the mid 1980s when it first came out and I saw it at the show.  Seeing it again in HD is a real treat and breathes new life in a true 1980s cinema classic.  Do yourself a favor and re-watch this one in HD or if you just have never seen it before the HD version is the way to go.

B00BSWMITK|5.0|'Unstoppable Momentum' is my early pick for 2013 Album of the Year!<br /><br />I will never attempt to try to speak the language of a musician because I am not one. First and foremost, I go on feeling with the music I listen to. A truly great album can immediately transport and move me. And Satch has done that with his last two albums.<br /><br />But where 'BS&WW' was a very good album that, with several listens, became a great album, I was immediately hooked the first time I put on 'UM'. It truly makes me happy every time I listen to it and, yes, it gets better and better with every play. I now rank 'US' up with 'Surfing with the Alien', 'Flying in a Blue Dream' and 'Crystal Planet' as my 'five-star' Satch discs.<br /><br />Satch is a master with a guitar and he doesn't disappoint on 'UM', that's no surprise. He still rocks out better than any other guitar player in my book. Additionally, he's been playing with more richness, texture and sophistication on his last two discs.<br /><br />Also, the fact that he always puts together an amazing rhythm section is no shock, either. But I am truly blown away by who he's cobbled together for 'UM'. This rhythm section really needs to be singled out for helping to propel a great Satch disc into a classic! They are fantastic!<br /><br />-- Vinnie Colaiuta is a beast behind the kit.<br />-- I love Chris Chaney's funk-i-fied bass.<br />-- And Joe, never let go of keep Mike Keneally as your keyboardist. He's terrific!<br /><br />Well done, Satch!!!!
B00165RLWI|5.0|Hello, yes this is definitely one of if not the best Duran Duran albums...Here is where they became really big in the U.S. via MTV. &#34;Hungry Like The Wolf&#34; and &#34;Rio&#34; were early MTV staples as well as big top 40 hits. &#34;Lonely in Your Nightmare&#34; is a nice romantic song, as is &#34;Save A Prayer&#34;, which was later released as a single that charted well in America. The album holds together really well, &#34;Hold Back The Rain&#34; and &#34;New Religion&#34; are good as well, with the latter providing the name for my late '80's high school garage band's name. &#34;The Chauffeur&#34; is an enchanting piece...you should see the video as well, although it is not for children. Nudity is what I'm saying here....Anyway I wore out my old cassette of this, and I now have it on mp3, so I can replace the Cd copies whenever I wear them out!!! Iconic cover art...what else can I say! If you love music that represents the best of the '80's, look no further than here!
B003XE1CU2|5.0|I bought these because I already had a pair and found them so comfortable I wanted more.  I have a lot of trouble with my feet and many shoes are uncomfortable, but not these!
B009T8XBBO|1.0|I got this as the FAOTD, and I only got to level 1.3 (so far no IAP options), and every time I click \\"play\\" on level 1.4, the screen goes black. After about 30 seconds, the phone goes back to my applications, as if the app force-closed. If it ever worked correctly and I got through the tutorial levels, I'm sure it would have been enjoyable to play.

DONT claim this is for the kindle if it is far to large to play without it crashing Gameloft. wont be downloading anymore of your games. thanks for wasting my time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED this book.  Had a hard time putting this one down.  I definitely recommend - a must read.  The 2nd half was a bit intense for me, but it could be because I can relate to the story.
193700788X|2.0|I waited and waited for this book and for Sam and Sookie to finally realize they loved each other and all I get is one sex scene and what 100 pages of them being together... but the story actually not being about them! I mean REALLY I've waiting since the first book for them to be together and its pretty much not even about them. So so so disappointed in the author. I would say that is book isn't even worth it. I only gave it two stars because ATLEAST Sam and Sookie did finally get together.

B009LGO88E|5.0|This hardware add-on gives you an extra Circle Pad, and the ZR and ZL Buttons. There are only 5 games or so that support the thing, but it is the definitive control scheme for those games(besides Kid Icarus, which only mirrors the control scheme). Metal Gear Solid 3D, Nano Assault EX, RE Revelations, Kingdom Hearts, and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate are the only games I know that use it. It is not required to play the games, but it definitely makes the games better IMO.<br />I highly recommend getting it if you have any of those games. I was personally holding off getting games offering this control scheme until I had this add-on. I have the Nano Assault EX game(cool game), and plan on getting Metal Gear Solid and possibly Kingdom Hearts since I bought this.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|slender man chapter 1 is one of the only real slender games on the market for kindle fire. most other slender games ive played involved throwing snowballs or collecting hidden objects.price is perfect for the game as it provides players with an enjoyable ( and terrifying) experience as well as giving moderate profit to the developers. now, there was, will and allways be glitches, such as making slender go outside the map and then he kills you suddenly or the magical spawning of 16 pages, but we cant help glitches, because most are too enjoyable fo mention, and with that, i conclue that everyone will buy this game
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I bought this game because I had seen my friend Jake playing it and thought it looked cool. I got it and was so happy that it was a game like temple run but with more,rebellious people and lots of themes. It does have its bugs though. I was still in New York when the Tokyo version came out. I downloaded the update but it didn't show up, so I deleted.the came and reinstalled it. But of course without thinking about  I didn't realize I would lose everything. I I'd get the update however I wish it was easier to update. Overall a great game but has its bugs too. Hope for more games like this in the future.
193700788X|2.0|I know who I wanted Sookie to end up with but even though Harris had something else in mind, it could have ended much more believably.  The way the relationship was ended was so crazy and the way she moved on to the next was just not true to the past events.  Even though \\"he\\" was not a sensitive guy, when it came towards Sookie I don't see him being so cold and indifferent and the fact that they never sat down and had a heart to heart left me feeling incomplete.  They might have parted with an acceptance that it was the best way, or even the only way but they didn't do that, it was just over, discarded.  The book did tie up some things but overall I was disappointed and I LOVED the beginning of the series, couldn't put them down when my friend lent me the first four or five books all at once.  The show is my guilty pleasure but I can't say that I love that either, so much of it is just out of character and I have just tried to accept that they are two completely different things.  I will miss the characters and appreciate how good the beginning of the series was.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Have reached goal weight and it is staying off.  I would say it is for those with some discipline, however, although it will give you a great idea of just how many calories there really are in foods and a much better ability to resist food even when you can have it.  You just begin to realize that you are not really that hungry most of the time, when you really are hungry and that there is no need to stuff yourself no matter what. The fasting part is not easy, but the author is right - there is always tomorrow.  As for those who say it is dangerous to skip meals, I just do not think so - almost all major religions have some form of fasting and everyone seems to survive.  Have found the weight is staying off by only having one heavier meal a day and making the others much lighter several times a week.  Also feel I have a plan before and post vacation - and can enjoy my vacation.<br /><br />Also think weight and weight loss is very personal and there is no one size fits all.  I refrain from telling others what works and what they should do about their weight loss journey because I honestly believe we do not really know and that even when we finally figure it out, it will be that no one thing works for everyone.  So these are my personal reflections on what has worked for me.<br /><br />Just wished there were more recipes for the modified fast days.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is the only CD so far that the entire family (age range from 3 to 40) can agree to listen to, from start to finish. It's also a great introduction to classical music for the kids, with its mash-ups of classical and pop music.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made! I saw it when it came out, and have been quoting it ever since (this one and Run, Fat Boy, Run! and Hot Fuzz). It's a &#34;parody&#34; of Dawn of the Dead, with addition of its own elements and great intelligent humor. It's a must see!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved the movie it was in great quality! My kids love wreck it ralph!! So much better than renting from redbox!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I can't base any of my opinion on the books since I haven't read any of them, but this was a really good film. It's not a summer blockbuster and not exactly Oscar material so I can't give it 5 stars, but I'd say if you liked Mel Gibson's film Edge Of Darkness and realistic action/crime movies then you will like this a lot as I thought they had many similarities. While it wasn't too difficult to figure out most of what was going on, and it doesn't try to hide much, it was fun to see how the characters interacted to get to the bottom of the mystery nonetheless. The quick and intelligent dialogue also adds to the rewatchability for those like myself who are a little slow keeping up first time through. Lots of good special features and I think Tom Cruise is going to be the next Chuck Norris. Diminutive, but dangerous.
125000098X|4.0|After the cliff hanger in the 2nd book I pre-ordered this one. It reads a bit like the Reader's Digest version of the novel it should be. The second biggest mystery is why the actual story does not comport with the blurb on the book jacket. The biggest mystery is why the British government let the bad guy go Scot free after a major smuggling operation was uncovered, which put several British citizens at risk for their lives.  I agree with other reviewers who were bewildered by the Cliftons allowing their son to continue to associate with a known criminal and Nazi sympathizer. Perhaps a 4th book will not only resolve the transparent cliff-hanger, but explain the weakness if not implausibility in the plot in this novel.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging and intriguing. Well worth the two dollars. Plus, if you buy it, they'll probably make another one. So get on it!
B00CATSONE|1.0|If you really want to know about Tesla, do not bother with this book.  It is a sham Biography, written by a Tony Robbins wannabe who simply goes on and on and on about intelligence and imagination.  It comes off like a High School essay.
0553030000|5.0|Never read an Agatha Christie novel but was inspired to purchase one from watching a Doctor Who episode. I purchased the 1960s hardcover edition and it looks like it got here from a time machine itself. The cover, inside binding, and pages look brand new. Very happy
0757302661|5.0|I used this book and cd during my pregnancy. It was so relaxing which we all need during pregnancy. Very relaxing! Highly recommended. I bought tis one for a friend of mine who is pregnant.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was extremely disappointed in the this book on so many levels. I actually met Charlaine Harris and told her that I wanted Sookie to end up with Eric. But I could tell by her body language that it wasn't going to happen. I feel that she could have done a better job in wrapping up the series. Like other reviewers, I have watched every show, anxiously counted the days until the books came out, drove 3 hours to get her autograph, etc. I have been a dedicated fan for many years and I am sad about her not ending up with Eric. Like others have said, he was wrong for her, but I loved their relationship and the fact that he would live forever was exciting to me.  I think that the best thing for me to do is to write my own fanfiction story and give this book a better ending. That way I can feel better about how my friend Sookie ends up.

B00BPWDMP2|4.0|The songs play like a 45-minute daze of professional country pop. Nothing really memorable, even the recent #1 hit \\"Downtown\\" feels a bit watered down. Lady A plays it safe first and foremost. Not too much country, just enough to keep country radio playing them. Just enough pop to nearly soften out any hard edges, and turn Lady A into a borderline country/soft rock band.<br /><br />While nothing on this CD is bad, nothing is really memorable, either. I think Lady A needs to take more chances on future releases, or risk giving up country radio for AC (adult contemporary) radio.<br /><br />Edit: It's now 6 months since my initial review, and while I generally stand by it, I would like to add that this CD has grown on me, and even though it borders on AC, it's so well done that it's hard to complain about it. So much so, that I have increased my review from 3 to 4 stars.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Pros:  Cheapest of the LGA 2011 sets but if you are looking to move to this socket type then you get good bang for the buck.  Very pleased to see that no graphics processing is built in with this line because as a gamer, that's not near good enough and completely unecessary.  Note this CPU is partially unlocked (could be a &#34;Con&#34; for some) and as such, you can push this guy up to about 4.4 GHz.  As someone who has just stepped into the world of overclocking, I've only pushed it up to 4.0 GHz and it runs beautifully with great stability.  I will update more specific info as I get appropriate measurements.  Thus far, everything I've thrown at it runs smooth as silk.  A bonus for this line is also the PCIe x 16 capabilities.  Pop in 2 video cards and you get the full 16 lanes of data transfer for each!<br /><br />Cons:  Not top of the line?  Only partially unlocked?  Doesn't come with a stock cooler either but few people use these anyways especially with higher end CPU's because a water cooler is the way to go.  These are the only possible issues I would see.<br /><br />Overall:  I am coming over to the Intel line after using AMD in every PC i've built up to this point ( 7 and counting) and I am very impressed by the performance.
1400067820|1.0|I am giving this book one star in keeping with Taleb's notion that low ratings may help his book's anti-fragility. As always with this author's books, they are great to read and cause great deal of irritation. There are plenty of good and excellent ideas, though some of it (non-linearity, for example) is repeated from Fooled by Randomness and Black Swan.<br /><br />The book is, indeed, a mixed bag. For one, Taleb doesn't seem to make a lot of effort with research before making opinionated statements, which sometimes are true and sometimes \\"not so much\\". For example: \\"it is not fat, but sugar that causes obesity\\". Actually, it's calories, but that's another discussion, which cannot be productive without serious reading. Taleb proclaims doctors to be dangerous, yet he goes to the emergency room when he breaks his nose. Yet, he argues with the attending doctor about the usefulness of the ice pack, as there is no research proving it. If anything, you will learn a lot about the author from the pages of his book, as he loves talking about himself.<br /><br />The critique aside, the book is a great read. The ideas are interesting, useful and more often than not controversial and irritating. Which is good, as it wakes you up and makes you think. I believe reading something you disagree with is more interesting than consuming just another confirmation of conventional views and your own beliefs. In spite of very annoying character traits I can confidently say that Taleb is an interesting person with whom I would enjoy sharing a drink. I would give the book five stars, but hey, anti-fragility, man.<br /><br />The point of my rumblings: I strongly recommend to read this book.

0385349947|5.0|I'd heard bad press and good press about Sheryl Sandberg so I was almost afraid her book, \\"Lean In\\" would be an exhorting/preaching book handed down \\"from above.\\" Thankfully, it isn't. While she states at the outset what she believes -- \\"A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes. I truly believe this would be a better world.\\" -- she is quick to admit regarding errors made climbing up the ladder, \\"This is not a list of things other women have done. I have made every mistake on this list.\\"<br /><br />When I am reviewing a book I want to give 1 or 5 stars to, I often quickly run through those reviews who would oppose mine, looking for balance. Perhaps they have seen something I missed. In this case I was shaken by the vitriol of those who not only hadn't seemed to have read the same book I did, not only hadn't noticed that the stats Sandberg quotes were not her \\"opinion,\\" but who were ragingly ugly over the fact that Sandberg is a \\"rich woman.\\" They felt she'd had it \\"easy,\\" and therefore \\"had no right\\" to tell less rich women what to do. It seems the divide between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots\\" is greater than I was aware of. In my humble opinion, she does not come off as anything approaching elitist or oblivious at all.<br /><br />To be clear, I am soundly working class as were both my parents, one a factory technician and the other a waitress. I was the first person in my family to attend college and I paid for it myself by working my way through. Being a human being, I wanted to be a success. But, of course, we have a choice as to what we want to be successful in, as Sandberg points out innumerable times, especially singling out full time mothers. I've run the gauntlet of several corporate rat races, and surely do know by now that there is more to life than your job. But the jobs I came to love and be passionate about are a big part of my identity. And many of those jobs did eventually die inside me for the very fact that, as a woman, I had nowhere to go but sideways or out. This book would have been extremely helpful to me back then.<br /><br />Though \\"Lean In\\" covers serious issues, it isn't a heavy, boring tome. It is written with a light and deft hand, humor there, if understated. She laments, \\"I have breast-fed two children and noted, at times with great dissappointment, that this was simply not something my husband was equipped to do.\\"<br /><br />There has long been a spell on the world -- the spell of the myth of male superiority. If you believe that a God created us, wouldn't it be stupid and exceedingly cruel for God to make one sex superior to another? The best reason to believe in the gender equality of leadership is given thusly by Sandberg: \\"The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have.\\" As a former teacher I have never once noticed little girls more unable to learn than little boys.<br /><br />Sandberg takes the time to list the external factors that contributed to her success. The internal factors<br />are self-evident as you read the book. And she doesn't shy away from the thorny issues of sex. She notes that Sr. men and Jr. women avoid one another, pointing out that \\"We cannot assume that interactions between men and women have a sexual component.\\" Of course, we can't assume they don't, either, but her point is well-taken. For a more straight-forward relationship between men and women in the workplace I would think men must be willing to drop their sense of entitlement every time they get aroused. But will they? We all know that when rumors start between a woman and a man, the woman gets the worst of it, even is she's totally innocent. I could call women out, too, I suppose, and say that those who think to get ahead by using their sexual \\"wiles\\" should choose another course, one with more integrity and self-respect. But, honestly, how many women still actually do that? A negligible amount.<br /><br />It was with relief that I read Sandberg's stance on emotions -- always a tender spot between the sexes.  Women get such a bad rap for their \\"feelings.\\" States Sandberg: \\"Sharing emotions builds deeper relationships.\\" And she cites the studies to support it. But, of course, women have always known this, haven't we? Men know it, too, but are mostly unwilling to experience it for fear of being called a \\"sissy,\\" and other epithets along those lines. In fact, a few nights ago on a talk show I heard a man joke that one way a woman could know if a man was gay is how avid he was about watching \\"Glee.\\" I got news for him. Any man who likes music or is a musician, who has issues with high school, who likes good storylines and who is at ease with his masculinity and emotions, likes \\"Glee.\\"<br /><br />Sandberg also does a good job dissecting the \\"Queen Bee\\" syndrome. She points out that, \\"It makes no sense for women to feel that we are competing against one another anymore,\\" and goes on to urge women to help and support one another. It wasn't within the scope of this book, but I'd like to point out that ten thousand years plus of being essentially worthless except as you may serve a man, and literally being \\"owned\\" by men can have, shall we say, a deleterious effect on a woman's outlook. Competing with other women for a man was the only survival technique women were allowed. By now it's in our DNA.

Why must women be as aggressive and hard-charging as men? Women could (and should) do it differently. It appears that Sandberg may be thinking this way.

Either gender.f that I read Sandberg's stance on emotions -- always a tender spot between the sexes.  Women get such a bad rap for their \\"feelings.\\" States Sandberg: \\"Sharing emotions builds deeper relationships.\\" And she cites the studies to support it. But, of course, women have always known this, haven't we? Men know it, too, but are mostly unwilling to experience it for fear of being called a \\"sissy,\\" and other epithets along those lines. In fact, a few nights ago on a talk show I heard a man joke that one way a woman could know if a man was gay is how avid he was about watching \\"Glee.\\" I got news for him. Any man who likes music or is a musician, who has issues with high school, who likes good storylines and who is at ease with his masculinity and emotions, likes \\"Glee.\\"<br /><br />Sandberg also does a good job dissecting the \\"Queen Bee\\" syndrome. She points out that, \\"It makes no sense for women to feel that we are competing against one another anymore,\\" and goes on to urge women to help and support one another. It wasn't within the scope of this book, but I'd like to point out that ten thousand years plus of being essentially worthless except as you may serve a man, and literally being \\"owned\\" by men can have, shall we say, a deleterious effect on a woman's outlook.

B004P7CN7W|5.0|This is one of my personal favorite movies of all time. People seemed to have forgotten about this but I love this movie. A classic
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Awesome<br />Love it can't wait to start reading it! I have waited months for this book to come out! Yeah!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was skeptical when I downloaded this calculator app but it's great. The numbers and everything is large and it adds as you go along. I recommend this to anyone.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I was intrigued until the end. Flynn is great writer who has a great way of weaving a true mystery. I love that the story is told in different time frames from different characters' points of view. A definite must read!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|this movie sucked!!!! had nothing to do with him! it should have been called amendment 13! it was way too long and didn't even show the assassination or give any facts about it!!!
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This CD is awsome and an all time favorite of mine due to the awsome songs on it, and the fact it got to me at an overseas location where im stationed in a week made it even better. All around GREAT PURCHASE.
B005LAII44|2.0|G.I. JOE: RETALIATION. I just watched the trailer again and I was right - - for ME...the trailer was definitely better than the movie. (lol) Don't get me wrong - I'm a fan of the cast. Channing Tatum was cool...The Rock a beast...Adrianne Palicki...HOLY CRAP BALLS!! That's all I'm going to say about her. (lol)<br /><br />I remember watching and thinking - \\"so far so good.\\" THEN...it got cheesy - - the whole meeting of Joe (Bruce Willis) - - guns all hidden in his house and was it just me - - but when I blinked - Bruce Willis was gone...like NOT a whole lot in the movie?! (lol) The Rock going to his old neighborhood?! THEN came the super cheesy stuff - Rza as a ninja master?!!? WTF?!!? That whole story between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes. WTF?!?! G.I. JOE: RETALIATION  felt rushed and confusing. For me - - it was a total let down.<br /><br />I give G.I. JOE: RETALIATION... 2 ½ out of 5 popcorns!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book. Highly upset that it had to end. Who have not read this book has no idea what their missing. Can't wait for the movie, just hope it's the exact way it is in the book.
B007REV4YI|4.0|SKYFALL...wait...before I got into the review...let me start off by saying... \\"I bet it's really cool being Daniel Craig.\\" (lol)<br />Ok - now that I got that out of the way - lets talk about SKYFALL...the latest 007 flick. I liked it. I liked it a lot. This movie had some serious action. Now - I'm still a Roger Moore 007 fan...but Daniel Craig. He's a beast. If you haven't seen this one - it's worth the watch. Oh...and Javier Bardem as a villain...HOLY CRAP BALLS. He was intense. Scary and creepy but cool all wrapped in one. (lol)<br /><br />Oh - and for those of you who have seen it - - was it just me - - or did they not really show off the Bond `girl' that much? Ahhhh I don't know. (lol)<br /><br />I give SKYFALL... 4 ½ out of 5 popcorns!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The beginning was a little slow, but to understand the dynamics between the characters, I believe it was necessary.This book built to a dramatic ending I did not see coming. I can't wait to read The Mocking Jay.
B00947N6D8|5.0|RISE OF THE GUARDIANS...is a MUST SEE movie people. If you haven't made the time to watch it yet - - what are you waiting for?! It's a GREAT movie. Defiantly one of favorites. While watching it - - I was kicking myself in the a$$ for not watching it in the theater - in 3D!! Visually on my TV was great - I could only imagine on the big screen.<br /><br />RISE OF THE GUARDIANS has a great story with great characters...and these great characters were led by great `voice power.' Chris Pine as Jack Frost, Alec Baldwin as North (Santa), Hugh Jackman as Bunny (Easter Bunny), Isla Fisher as Tooth (The Tooth Fairy), and Jude Law as Pitch (Evil dude). The movie's got hella action, magic, laughs, and...you just might get teary eyed. (I did)<br /><br />Soooo...gather everyone together - make some popcorn - and watch the movie!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|OMG I'm in the 5th chapter and so bored, wow Sookie wakes up and goes to work and gets her mail and dances around her house.  Blah blah blah booooorring!  I'm sorry I spent 15 dollars on this ebook. I skipped to the end I was so bored and guess what, it's a stupid ending that had no build in the other books. It's like she just wrote blah blah blah blah the end!  Thanks for abandoning us all!
B00AIBZM40|4.0|I watched MAMA the other night and I gotta say...despite what MOST people told me...I really liked it. I got my hands on the Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy+UltraViolet copy - don't bother asking me for the `inside code' - I already gave that away to my co-host Jennyfly of JennyflyBlog.com (lol)<br /><br />So lets talk about the movie - I do find it funny that Jessica Chastian's name is right above the title of the film. (lol) Oscar's baby. (lol) Ya know...ZERO DARK THIRTY. But to be honest - I found her the hottest in LAWLESS...either way...she's dope. Guillermo Del Toro presents the film - so if you're a fan of him, PAN'S LABRINTH and HELL BOY...you should already get this movie. MAMA definitely has the Guillermo `feel.' The cast in the film - I thought was on point. Jessica Chastain as the rocker girlfriend is cool - Boyfriend/Uncle to these  two little girl's played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones) - he does great AND...I can't forget about these two adorable little girl's - - - my little TARZAN kids!! These two were just awesome...especially the littlest one named Lilly....with all her little growls and eating on the floor with the family pet. HILARIOUS. Now lets about the special effects - I liked them. MAMA was believable and she didn't play! (lol) I'd suggest turning off all the lights when you watch this. (lol)<br /><br />My little Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy+UltraViolet copy contains some cool stuff. Deleted scenes, Original Short with Introduction by Guillermo del Toro, The Birth of Mama and more. Make sure you read the back if you decide to buy it...the Blu-ray contains an exclusive.<br /><br />I give MAMA... 4 out of 5 popcorns. Even though a lot of people told me...\\"Mike, you're going to like...but the ending totally sucks.\\" I didn't agree. I thought the ending did the movie justice. I was happy and that's why I say MAMA is worth adding to your movie collection.<br /><br />You see it? What did you think?
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|THESE ARE THE KIND OF BOOKS THAT HOOK YOU FROM THE START AND DONT' LET GO UNTIL WEEKS AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED READING THEM.  GREAT WRITING, INTERESTING CHARACTERS, THOUGH PROVOKING SITUATIONS.  THAT'S WHAT JODI  DOES BEST, I THINK.  SHE MAKES US EXAMINE BOTH SIDES OF EVERY SITUATION.  VERY INTERESTING READ.
B00CBKXGPI|3.0|I was so exited to see this game for my Kindle Fire HD. I have it on my PC and love it. It played fine for about a half hour but now shuts down whenever I try to exit an auction house after delivering a request. I would have happily paid the $1.99 for the full game if not for this problem. Such a shame. 3stars for the game itself...would have been 5&hellip;
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I know everyone raved about this book.  And it was recommended to me by many many friends.  I just can't stay interested in it at all.  Wish I could.  Have started and stopped reading it three time now.  Wish I hadn't spent my money on it.  Wouldn't feel so cheated if I'd checked it out of the library instead of paying for it.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  Is a good start for watching other movies in the Marvel Universe.  Am told there is a sequel in the works, and we are looking forward to the continuation of the storyline.  Captain America is pretty much family friendly.  There are a couple of scenes that might be disturbing, but overall clean cut.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Great read. I love CS Lewis books.  I think this book was much better than the movie.  I am getting ready to read the next one.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I've always loved this version.  I just can't get over how wonderful this cast is.  Richard sure proves even if you don't sing a song, as long as you have the heart and soul of the music and lyrics you can still perform the songs with great passion and artistic interpretation.  I love the way he yells.....seems like it goes on forever!  The wedding scene is awe inspiring!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app all the time to leave myself reminders to do things, keep track of lists and any other time I might need to remember something!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I absolutely love this show and download episodes to my kindle so I can watch them while on long plane rides.  I never get tired of watching these episodes and see the characters evolve. Love it!
B008CPRLP2|4.0|This is a version of winzip that I use on my Kindle Fire.  It works pretty well, and takes up very little room on the kindle.  I would use it again.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It is a wonderful book and I got it instantly on my kindle. I recommend this book for high action and witty sarcasm.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I watched \\"Sinister\\" with no real expectations. After all, most horror movies follow the same patterns and are barely worth watching. This one seemed headed in that direction until Ethan Hawke's character finds those old footage reels of snuff films. Those alone make this movie creepy. The soundtrack played as the reels roll and Hawke's character watches families be murdered in horrible ways is so strange and eerie. I had no clue where this movie was going, but I knew I was creeped out every time one of those snuff films was played.<br /><br />The sense of impending doom is heavy, the acting is top notch, the crumbling family structure is believable, and everything is so mysterious that you realize that mystery and not knowing just what the hell is really going on is more frightening than true horror and gore.<br /><br />When things come to light at the end of the films you do get the sense of things clicking into place, although admittedly if you spend too much time thinking about it all you'll wonder how and why certain things happened. For instance, why an evil force/serial killer would need a bunch of snuff films to strike again. It really is massively convoluted by the end, and yet, that makes it all the creepier. The mystery never truly ends. All you know is that no one is safe, and you had better hope you never find a box full of snuff films in your attic. If you do, don't watch them!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Entertaining game. Lots of fun. Ropes you in and keeps you hanging on for hours of fun. Addictive and hypnotic.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Easy read. Very deep character development. Interesting twist at the end. There is Definitely a reason this is considered a classic
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am new to reading in 27 years<br />I have never really enjoyed it until now. This book is easy to read, but maybe just a little too easy. Most of his books are the same, but I still like them.  This book was somewhat predictable and no real suspense. And no I had not yet watched the movie.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|It's nothing fancy, just a game where you launch little luna on a trajectory back to earth. Buy upgrades to make your trip home a little easier since you're being pursued by a horrible crab nebula!!!

B009NY43NY|3.0|I was expecting more for the last book. To feel that everything would work out right and more between her and Eric. Wish there was another book. Just feel left wanting more!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app. It's great for the mind. It gets you thinking a lot. I wish they add a update. I totally LOVE THIS app.
0425263916|5.0|If you love Fifty Shades of Grey, you'll love this series! I already pre ordered the next book! Can't wait to read it!
193700788X|2.0|*********SPOILER ALERT*************<br /><br />This book almost starts at the end, with you knowing (or being able to easily guess) who Sookie's enemies are, and that, in my opinion, takes away some of the fun and mystery from the book. I admit I did enjoy the plot twist at the end though, but only for a brief moment as it seems like that only made sense with some ridiculous explanation. It felt like a slap dash fix to a badly thought-out plot.<br /><br />New concepts are brought in, like the devil, which seemed hastily constructed to further the plot, but didn't make a whole lot of sense.<br /><br />Throughout the book, it is made apparent that Charlaine Harris had mentally said her farewells to her characters. She knew how she wanted to finish the book, and so she forced her characters into the story rather unnaturally, rather than letting her characters write the story. A lot of them behave out of character. Sookie, for example, just gives into Sam without any kind of \\"I don't want this to ruin our friendship, what do we do if things don't work out\\" conversation. Copley Carmichael's crazy reason for wanting sookie dead just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense, and Eric knew Sookie well enough to play her like an Ace in previous books, but completely drops the ball in this one???<br /><br />Over all, it was compelling to read...I had to find out what was going to happen, but I was highly disappointed when I did. The narrative was jarring, and the flow was broken by hasty explanations of events that made no real sense.
193700788X|1.0|I do thank Mrs. Harris for bringing these characters to life. With that said, I am beyond disappointed in the outcome of the series and don't want to repeat the reasons that have already been stated here. I am glad to see I am not the only disappointed fan judging by the reviews I've read. I think I'll stick to library copies from now on as I could have spent the money I paid for this on something I would actually enjoy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What I miss in this book is an appendix that explains the realism of all the solutions this fantastic astronaut comes up with. Can you really grow potatoes on March? Or make water or oxygen the way he does it. I am not a scifi fan, but was thrilled by the will to survive and creativity this astronaut shows. Very hard to put down!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Hard to believe that this album is 40 years old.  I work at a university and the other day heard a fraternity group playing this out in the commons.  Some things never get old.  Glad to hear that the young folks like Pink Floyd, too.
193700788X|2.0|Let's start with the positives first:<br /><br />1) The writing improved significantly from the last book and the reader was not subjected to the Idiot's Guide to character and back-story rehashing that plagued book 12.<br /><br />2) Many old character favorites return and their displays of support for Sookie in her time of need was incredibly touching.<br /><br />3) Finally, closure and the ability to move on from this dysfunctional relationship I embarked upon many years ago when I first decided to read about red-necked vampires.<br /><br /><rant><br />Now on to the negatives and why I feel an effigy of Harris should be brought to her next book tour/signing and c*nt punted (wow, never thought I'd ever be angry enough to use that in any sentence) in plain view to everyone's cheering, because I don't how else to describe how let down I feel by Harris. Funny how selling souls to the devil is a plot device in the this book when this is exactly what Harris did when she contracted to write 13 books and unnecessarily draw out the storyline to the detriment of common sense and the character assassination of beloved characters.<br /><br />1) Upon initial reading, I thought Harris reclaimed some of the writing charms present in her earlier books; I was keenly invested in discovering the bad guy and how everything tied together. Unfortunately, once it was revealed who was behind the frame/torture/kill Sookie club, I felt incredibly let down. Amelia's father's vendetta against Sookie already seemed far-fetched and served only to cheaply redirect the reader's attention to the true Big Bad. The 'let's torture Sookie plot\\" was preposterous and unnecessarily convoluted. It reminded me of that moment when Dorothy pulled the curtain only to discover the Wizard was behind everything. Why the let down? Because the build up was so brilliantly executed only to flop at the end.<br /><br />2) As mentioned earlier, many characters made cameos. While it was great to read about them one last time and to give their relationship with Sookie some closure, it shouldn't have been done at the expense of properly tying up the Eric/Sookie relationship -- especially when he played such a major role in her life these last few books. Even if Harris never meant for them to be together (he was too ambitious, power hungry, and practical / she never wanted to turn and lose what was left of her humanity), I think the breakup deserved a little more coverage besides the note passing and third party communication that plagued the entire book. She built up a much beloved character only to character assassinate him in the end and give the readers a collective 10 page cameo in the book?! Hell, even Quinn had more of a presence!<br /><br />3) And Niall! Why on earth would he even chance letting Claude escape if it was known how much he hated Sookie and blamed her for his demise? Why would a grandfather go through so much effort to reconnect, save (countless times), and bless his only grandchild only to let loose an unhinged psychopath? And for what, to root out \\"potential\\" traitors still in his midst?! Seems like Ms. Harris pulled another cluviel dor out of her ass and decided to use its power to character revise and assassinate all the characters readers grew to love from previous books.<br /><br />I am going to pretend Book 4's \\"Dead to the World\\" was the last book in the series and try my best to ignore that Harris stupidly alienated all her fans in an attempt to pad her bank account.<br /></rant>
B005NNURES|5.0|Pink Floyd never disappoints.  I had this on vinyl when it first came out and had not listened to the entire album in years until I purchased it on amazon.  Sounds great!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I watch and own alot of movies.  But I don't remember the last time I rented a movie and immediately ordered it and the soundtrack after I<br />finished watching it.  The movie was great, fun to watch and the cast<br />was incredible.  But the music is the real star.  It is infectious and<br />sung well by all involved.  These are the songs I have listened to and<br />loved.  Tom Cruise blew my mind.  He looked pretty good in those<br />leather pants and who knew he could sing.  What a voice.  He was perfect<br />as Stacee Jaxx.  When he was on screen I could not take my eyes off of<br />him.  I have watched this movie 2 more times since its arrival 2 days<br />ago and have been listening to the CD almost non=stop as well.<br />Love the movie.  Love the CD.  Love Tom Cruise.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|I was so excited to get Wall-E for my little guy, who is currently completely and utterly in love with \\"ree-bots,\\" as he calls them. So imagine my disappointment when the DVD arrives and won't play on a single computer or DVD player in the house.  Even worse, I was able to get the commercials/previews to play on one player, but then the actual movie still froze up.  (Stay classy, Disney.)<br /><br />I guess I should be glad that I've been through this with other DRM-crippled DVDs, and therefore knew to try it out while my son was not present, or there would have been major preschooler tears.<br /><br />But as if that weren't enough, the digital copy included on disc three requires an unlock code that was supposedly included on an insert in the DVD packaging.  I am sitting here looking at every piece of packaging that was in or on the DVD (even the plastic wrap) -- there is no such insert/code included.  Sorry, kid... no ree-bots on the iPad, either.<br /><br />So basically, what I've got here is a 3-Disc Special Edition Coaster Set, and zero ree-bots for my kid.  Thanks for nothing, Disney.<br /><br />[UPDATE:  As I sit here fuming over my serious lack of ree-bots, I just noticed the very, very fine print... \\"Digital Copy Activation Code expires November 18, 2009.\\"  Maybe that's why there wasn't a code in my packaging, but wow, if you're going to do it that way, Disney, maybe don't sell this version after that date?  What a total, utter rip-off.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The &quot;temple run&quot; series of games have all been pretty good, but I confess that this is my favorite.  The game play is very smooth and simple enough for a child, but the challenges are increasingly demanding.  The graphics are absolutely superb.  The game is quite addictive and does not become tedious.  Overall, it is an amazing piece of work for such a low price.  The game was purchased for the Kindle Fire HD.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing!<br />I'm not going to say anything about the book...people need to read it for themselves.<br />A truly amazing book that should be required reading.

B00B2166BS|5.0|As promised it charges the N10 rapidly, fits perfectly and the magnets provide a nice tactile feedback for connection. I wish the cable was a bit longer though.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|In this film John Goodman plays his part so well I still think of him.  It is funny and exciting
B001AQO3QA|3.0|&#34;Alien Resurrection&#34; disc was missing in my collection--even though it was shrink-wrapped. Opened the package too late and missed the opportunity to return it. Disappointed.
193700788X|1.0|Disappointed by the book.... do not waste ur money I waited for months for this crap...sticking to the HBO series...
193700788X|1.0|I should have stopped reading three books ago.  This is the laziest, most poorly ending for any series I have ever read.  The author should be ashamed of herself. There is nothing good I can say about this book.  The characters are completely inconsistent with their previous personalities.  In order to have a cameo appearance of every character who has been in the series the author has sacrificed all emotion in the story.  I felt like I was reading bullet points or an outline, not a finished work.  I ever thought Harris was a great writer, but the one thing she had going for her was character development. Here she undoes anything good about this series.  Don't buy it, don't read it, anything you make up in your head will be better.
B0041D843M|5.0|If you love facts and statistics, there are plenty of those....  I personally skimmed over a lot of that, but learned so much and ended up changing the way I eat.  I have never been heavy, but lost 20 pounds just changing my eating habits.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I thought this was a great ending to the series, and Ms.Harris did herself proud! I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />I know plenty of fans would have liked Sookie to end up with Eric instead (me included) who for unknown reasons did seem to have a strange personality change from his chronic, steadfastly loyal devotion to Sookie - but the signs were there all along (from the very first book, and spattered throughout the series) that Sam and Sookie had magnetism, and Sookie wanted as close to a human life as possible - babies and human ritual marriage included. It only made sense if you were watching all the signs, that were in fact piling up. Alcid was the only other option for Sookie, but he let her down at critical moments in the past when Sookie's life was on the line, and a gal isn't likely to forget about that - even if she did forgive him for it.<br /><br />This book had great plot, action, and suspence - everything a die-hard fan of the series could hope for. It even had a very final conclusion which was nice.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed in the least, in fact I thought it was a fabulous finish of a book in a series that for me at least ended for me waaaay too soon.<br /><br />BRAVO!<br /><br />A+
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|If you like building city or Kingdom type games you will love this game. I wish it was easier to get more pearls. Attract alot of rare fish and you can get them.
193700788X|1.0|I am grateful for two things. I stopped buying 4 books ago and this author introduced me to other great paranormal authors.
030758836X|1.0|This was a really good read until the end. There was clearly a lot of tension and suspense between good, bad and evil going on which was a fun ride. However at the end it took a U-turn when the two main characters are BOTH portrayed as being equally sick with no resolution.  I feel like I wasted a good journey--just to end up at a dead end. Maybe I was disappointed because it was on a \\"best mysteries\\" list. I don't think it belongs in that category.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works almost all of the time, plus I really enjoy viewing Pinterest on my Kindle Fire over my tiny phone screen.
193700788X|3.0|Though most of this book is a \\"last review\\" of all the characters who have been a part of Sookie's life, and ties each one up in a neat little bow, for fans of this series, you have to finish it. It is a hell of a lot better written than the last one, though not as good as the first 5. As disappointed as I was with her plot choice, it's her book to the end...unlike the last one that I don't believe that she even wrote.
193700788X|1.0|As an avid fan of the series, I just reread the previous books before this one so I would remember what was going on with the characters.  I have to say, this book lacks imagination, creativity, and is just downright depressing compared to the first books.  Sookie is such a wonderful character full of life and even though she continues to be knocked down, she still keeps on trooping.  She is what everyone wants to read in fiction (always has beautiful men after her, good southern woman who can't be defeated by anything) and Harris turned her into a sad old maid who has to settle so she won't be alone.  Also, I understand that in real life a person would no doubt deal with overwhelming depression and sadness after going through the ordeals  Sookie has, but this is fiction and the last two books have been utterly miserable to try to read because the tone is so dejected.<br />After going through all the trouble to make the elaborate romance between Eric and Sookie, it is just dismissed in less than a chapter.  REALLY?  While I think most readers knew they would never end up together forever, the way it is simply cast aside just makes me sad.  Also, after book after book of seeing Sam as `just a friend' he is suddenly this super sexy love interest in the last two chapters?  I know they've kissed once or twice in the past books, but having her be with Sam so soon after being `heartbroken' by Eric? Come on now!!!  In the end I think the author lost faith in the series and it truly shows in the writing.  If you read the first book there is a stark contrast in the way it is written and the way the characters are portrayed.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I hate that paying for this book means I gave Charlaine Harris money for such a travesty of a book.  To say that I'm<br />disappointed is too much of an understatement.  As the author of a beloved series Ms. Harris your fans deserved better, as an author your craft deserved better.  I want my money back and the time I wasted reading this pitiful, disappointing finale

B009NY43NY|2.0|If you are like me, you might not be sure you want to read/purchase this book given the entire slew of awful reviews. It really is hard to sort through the anger and the bitterness and venom circulating, to find reliable opinions about whether this book is any good or not.<br /><br />My mother in law purchased it for her Nook, so after she went to bed I borrowed the nook and sat down to read. It took about four hours.<br /><br />The most awful line of the book: He looked more prosperous than when he was broke.  - Really? You don't say!<br />The best line of the book: \\"Sookie. You are mine.\\"<br /><br />I didn't like the non-Sookie Pov sections, and honestly I don't think they added to the story. If anything I think they only served as filler to lengthen the book. Which is truly sad, because in all actuality most of the book felt like filler. I was never able to settle into a cohesive plot because it seemed like each page was a new episode of \\"who will show up for a brief reconciliation from their past wrongs today.\\" It felt like each character that has been important in the past that was still alive or undead showed up with an apology for how they'd wronged her in the past, only to help her for a scene, then be called away. The ones who couldn't come make a half-hearted apology followed by an excuse of why she isn't first to them, participated in the juvenile plot against her.<br /><br />Eric isn't as much as shadow of himself as some of the reviews would lead you to be. We still get a \\"Sookie, you are mine.\\" He does absolutely everything in his power to protect Sookie, even at the expense of himself. This, to me, was the best part of the book. I've known for so long that he does truly love her, and I think many of his actions showed it.  While I don't agree with all of his actions, and some things were disappointing, I think their resolutions could have been carried out better.<br /><br />After his trouble in the previous book, Sam truly is a shadow of himself in this volume. I saw nothing of the close friendship between them of the past, and he left me boggled a lot of the time. He did put Sookie first, and I suppose that should count for something, but his choice didn't seem reasonable or in character.<br /><br />I've attempted to keep the first part of this review as spoiler free as possible. If you don't want spoilers, please don't read any more of this review.<br /><br />As far as Sookie and Eric not ending up together: it breaks my heart, but I think it could have been done in a way that I would have been able to accept. The reasons given (that he was determined to turn her, and she didn't want that) are valid and do make sense. But to be effective, it needed to be set up better. IF they weren't going to have a HEA together ( and I really wish they would have ) then I think they should have ended it a few books ago. They could have broken up, and then in book twelve they could have found a way to be friends, much like her and bill. They could have found a happily not together, but not out of each other's lives. Would I have been sad? Yes. But I would have understood. Then, the romance between her and Sam could have been a big undercurrent of book 12. We could have seen chemistry growing strongly, and even possible have been routing for them to wake up and realize it. Then she could have saved him in the end, we would cross our fingers that it would make a turning point, and this book could have clinched it ( as long as he was more present in it. )<br /><br />I entirely respect that Charlaine Harris had her own vision of how it should end. She is the author, after all. What I don't respect is the way it was carried out. She could have had this end, while still offering fans a sense of gratification for sticking with the series for 13 books.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are still on the fence about whether to read this or not, I would say it honestly doesn't matter. I don't think it offers any satisfying conclusion foranything. Even Sam and Sookie aren't a done deal. If you are looking for closure, maybe the coda will offer it. If you want to read it just so you will have read everything, then go for it.anything. Even Sam and Sookie aren't a done deal. If you are looking for closure, maybe the coda will offer it. If you want to read it just so you will have read everything, then go for it.

B002KKCVX2|3.0|sandal feels great on your feet right out of  box. One thing I find irritating is velcro strip on top ankle strap is not glued down at it's tip and therefore tends to catch each time I put them on and tighten the strap. I've walked 18 holes three times in them and notice If straps not fitted correctly sore red spots show up fairly soon. I did not have these issues with my Columbia Sandles
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A movie that actually celebrates feeling and being true to yourself. This was a movie I won't forget!! It deals with divorce and how to recover from circumstances out of control. I laughed out loud, cheered at the screen and shed a tear or two.
1455526959|5.0|Michael Connelly has one of the very best series I've ever read. I only discovered his books recently, but I have made it a point to purchase every one I could find. Luckily, I did find them all and have just finished 'The Black Box'. True to form, it is such a great story. Harry Bosch is an unforgettable character that you wouldn't want coming after you if you were a criminal. I feel like I've known him since the tunnels of Vietnam and can't wait for the next book!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was recommended to me by my sister who is an avid reader.  I am grateful she suggested it since I was captivated by both the story and the writing.  Beautiful descriptions, touching scenes, humor, interesting characters....I absolutely loved every minute I spent with Harold Fry.

B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|Dido is an artist who is not afraid to tell the same story over and over. With Girl Who Got Away, the music again matches that mastery of her lyrical chapter-esque persona. The deluxe version continues the gold that is mined, coining many wonderfully sublime and introspective lyrics, ethereal music lighting the mystery, just enough to bring to life her unique talent and vision. Her warm and personal vocals came across wonderfully, even before I was able to hear it on more than the tinny quality of an old laptop. This cd is debut album good.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I bought this because I heard a lot about it. It's ok. Not my favorite, but if you like that sort of thing, and believe in woman power (which I actually do), then go for it! Just a little on the gives-no-room-for-the-conspiracy-theory side of things, which I happen to believe.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have looked over other people's reviews and I really want to clear up why I think this is the best Sookie book. Harris' writing is completely different in this last installation-- and I think for the better. She had a lot of things to live up to and was I completely satisfied- no! But who is when their favorite book series ends? She had a lot of loose ends to tie up but I honestly believe this storyline and the way she presented the characters was so radically different than she usually did in the other books that it was bound to upset loyal fans. Maybe I am in the minority but I really really enjoyed it!
B009T8XBBO|4.0|This game doesn't take a whole lot of skill, but it's definitely cute and the graphics are sweet. It's simple, as it only requires that you tap resources as they appear, but you still have to watch for resource spawns and wait for your little workers to be ready to collect things. I had fun playing with it and will most likely toy around with it again. Our son loves it (he's 8).<br /><br />I don't know what people are talking about with IAP, that might be in the free version? But I downloaded this paid version as the 'app of the day' and have yet to see any IAP. The best part is there are no ads and no pop ups asking for money. Maybe that comes later, but I'm not seeing it yet!<br /><br />Anyway, very cute game. :-)
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|I must say, for an album titled, \\"Intense,\\" I was shocked at how placid it really is. When I saw the name, and listened to a couple of singles, I was skeptical. Thankfully, Armin blew my expectations (which were still high despite my initial reactions) sky high. The opener is one of the most intriguing songs I have ever heard, words cannot describe it, just listen to it. The second song, I have mixed feelings about, I love house but it doesn't do anything super special. Its still good though, but it really picks up from here. I feel that any more words that I write will just be pointless, I could drone on and on about genres and how I feel about individual songs. But for those with an interest in this album, know that there is something for everyone on here and it is one of Armin's best productions period. If you are an old fan, buy this one, it won't dissapoint. If you are a new fan, give it a listen as well and have your mind blown. For those on the fence, Armin released it on spotify, its free (and legal) to listen (provided you don't mind some ads) and if you like it, give it a buy!!!<br /><br />Personal favorite songs are:<br />Intense, Beautiful Life (likely my favorite), Waiting for the Night, Sound of the Drums, Forever is Ours and Who is Afraid of 138?!
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I LOVE this app. Our kids love it too. It's exciting and loaded with lots of movement action, light sabers, and sound clips from the movies. It's so much fun to keep the ball rolling to see what else you can trigger. There is SO much thought and detail put into this! You should absolutely watch the preview video if you haven't already. It's just amazing.<br /><br />When you first load it you have to sign in with Facebook (there are a few other options) so that you can access the community bits & scores, or else you can play as a guest. But it's still lots of fun to play. The only IAP is to collect the other two tables. I'll be purchasing those soon - and I can't wait to see what others they come out with!
B009R659L8|5.0|Fast paced. Stumped several times. Quick read. Highly recommend this novel to readers who enjoy mystery and murder. A true page turner.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game reminds me of Diablo. The art is colorful and well-done, and I love how there are vocals to go with NPC chat. You have a few classes to choose from (and you can pick male/female) and you can choose a name for your character. The game is designed really well, and it has replayability, as you can return by fast-travel to certain dungeons to run them again for more gold and gear drops. The graphics are pretty slick for attack and power moves. It's quite addicting.<br /><br />I do wish you could set more than one game profile, and I don't like how often it displays IAP items (mainly flashing on loading screens), BUT they are easy to avoid so far. I'm patient, and this is by no means going to be my only form of entertainment, so I'm pretty sure I'll be able to continue to play without spending real money. If nothing else, it's a visually attractive game that's fun to come back to and play around with.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend turning off IAP settings so you don't accidentally click on something and spend money.

B006P4FBUE|5.0|I love this app. I use a Kindle Fire HD tablet, and I don't have any trouble with lag like others have said. If there is any, it's not noticeable. The piano sounds realistic, there is a good selection of other 'instruments' to use (though the drum kit is only a single pitched drum sound), and it includes rhythm beats. Those are a bit harder to play long with, but they're fun to use.<br /><br />My tablet allows more than 2 touch points, so I am able to play chords easily. I've been able to test more than 4 notes at a time. I might be able to do more than that. And if you're interested in learning any songs, there are simple ones in a decent, alphabetical selection - many classics in there, including the Star Spangled Banner. MANY more to choose from compared to some other piano apps I've tried.<br /><br />To sum it up, I love this app. It's beautifully displayed, has lovely sound, and has many tools to choose from as you play. I highly recommend it!
B00BJB2C8W|3.0|Look Tyler is awesome and his 4th album will hopefully be his best but wolf compared to goblin and bastard just doesn't pass the bar it's not terrible or anything it's good, but I expected more from tyler this is his worst album so far.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|This game definitely reminds me of Skyrim, like a few other reviewers have said. That's not a bad thing! The graphics are stunning for a mobile app, and on my Kindle Fire HD Tablet, I haven't seen any graphical glitches or tearing so far. It has only barely lagged a bit while turning the camera as it renders the scenery, and only once in a while. It has a very brief 'tutorial' to walk you through the basic controls. The quests are logic-based... you have to open and read your quest logs and use your brain to figure out where to go, which is great. The menus are pretty self-explanatory and easy to figure out once you explore them a bit.<br /><br />I only wish there was more than one race/sex to choose from, but I'm glad there were some options for character customization. That is the ONLY reason I rated it 4/5 stars.

1400069742|4.0|During our current partisan debates we hear a lot about the halcyon days of old when everyone agreed and saw eye to eye. Lynne Olsen does a great job of showing how that ideal is nothing more than a fable with this book.  She does a great job of evoking the tense and partisan actions which took place in the debate preceding America's entry into WWII.  The debate here was very fierce and combative as almost an debate in American history.  It was as hard hitting and as personal as almost anything we see today. Olsen does a great job of identifying heroes and villains and showing how some American's realized what the true stakes were and put their minds to making the right decision. I greatly enjoyed reading about the tragic foibles of Lindberg and Roosevelt. I do think the crisis in the Pacific receives too short thrift in the book but I can understand why that's the case.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a decent book and I encourage history buffs to read it.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I had been looking at quartz analog watches in about this price range for a while, and couldn't seem to find any that I liked the looks of very much.  Then I found this one, having a rugged yet understated look.  And on top of that, I get a mechanical watch!  I couldn't really give a rational reason for wanting a mechanical watch, but I've been wanting one anyway.  One advantage might be that it doesn't sound a tick every second.<br /><br />Mine loses about six seconds a day.  This doesn't bother me too much, as I'm old enough to remember the days before quartz watches.  I set it a minute ahead and let the watch get more accurate as time goes on.  I haven't yet experimented with different resting positions to see whether this makes a difference.<br /><br />I went in to the repair shop today to ask about having the watch regulated, not that I would necessarily have it done - I was just curious.  They had the black version on display.  I thought the price tag said $195, or maybe it was $185.  The box mine came in was labeled $185, the list price given by Amazon for the other colored versions.<br /><br />The luminescence is very good.  Before retiring, I charge it up for a few seconds with the bedside lamp, and I can tell the time all night long.  The dark dial helps with visibility in low light conditions.<br /><br />Some people say this watch is small, but it's a classic men's size watch.

B000FC13Y0|5.0|A foolish boy, Tristan, makes a romantic promise to fetch a fallen star for the girl he has a crush on. Then he actually tries to go get it from beyond the \\"wall\\" where there's a fairy land like no other.<br /><br />Gaiman breaks all kinds of rules in Stardust. (As an \\"emerging\\" novelist myself, I've been studying these rules). The story starts with the hero's very conception! That's something so David-Copperfield-antiquated that a modern writer rarely attempts it. Stardust also has quite a bit of summary,  a.k.a. telling instead of showing--eek!.<br /><br />However, it also has a lot of tried and true storytelling elements: a great hook, some fabulously nasty villains and a \\"quest\\" plot where the hero goes in search of an object to help him win true love. The hero gets what he wants but not in the way you might expect--all good stuff.<br /><br />But by far the greatest reason Stardust is such fun to read--and I'm beginning to suspect this is true for most of Gaiman's books--is the quality and originality of its imagined world. So much fantasy these days just rips off a page from Tolkien's world or a traditional fairy tale, but Gaiman manages to make Stardust's magical world feel familiar while at the same time creating characters and situations that are quite different.<br /><br />So check Stardust out. I highly recommend it. Oh and the movie adaptation isn't bad either...<br />(This review and others can also be found on my blog at sarazaske.wordpress.com)
0545101417|5.0|The reader's voice was clear and not boring. The book is awesome! Really enjoyed this second book of the trilogy.
1426308469|5.0|We received this book as a gift for our dinosaur-obsessed 2-year old. He absolutely loves it - the pictures are very vivid and and descriptive, and the facts about each species are quite informative. It also includes a pronunciation guide for each dinosaur (which is important, as the book does not shy away from several tricky to pronounce names), as well as a helpful size guide for each. This book has been exceptionally educational for our son - and certainly for his parents - and I cannot recommend it more highly if you have a young child who shows serious interest in learning about dinosaurs.
B0068RHSZO|5.0|I thought this was an excellent thriller. It plays mind games with the viewer to try and figure out the plot ... which I enjoy. The acting was very good and its not like some thrillers made today where computer graphics try to enhance a mediocre plot line.
B001AVCFJM|2.0|Despite the fact that there are over 1800 reviews for 2009's STAR TREK on here already, I feel compelled to add my opinion that this movie is a big disappointment. OK, it's got good production values, with nice special effects and a good cast. I'm not surprised that it's popular with most younger non-Star Trek fans. But the best of all the Star Trek incarnations have had good, thoughtful stories giving us a hopeful future for humanity. What is the basic story in this movie? A renegade Romulan is trying to destroy the planet Vulcan by sinking a black hole into it, and the Enterprise has to stop him. From that point on it's over-the-top action with no positive vision for the future at all. Forget about interesting science fiction concepts! Some people have said that the story of this movie does not matter much since it's primarily establishing the characters for future movies. But what good are characters if there's no interesting story? Not much.<br /><br />Further, the glaring inconsistencies with previous Star Treks makes this movie unacceptable to me as a long-time fan of the show. Other reviewers have gone over much of this, but the ones that are most glaring to me are 1)most of the original cast being on the Enterprise under Captain Pike, 2)Ensign Chekov being navigator under Captain Pike when he took that role in the original Trek's second season under Captain Kirk, 3)Spock's mother dying when Spock is a young officer under Pike. What about \\"Journey to Babel\\" from the original series (TOS)? 4)Spock saying \\"not this time\\" when Kirk suggests being compassionate to the Romulans, 5)Spock and Uhura having a hot romance going (sorry, \\"Amok Time\\" from TOS is ignored too), and 6)the design of the bridge and other parts of the Enterprise looking nothing like it did in TOS's pilot episode, \\"The Cage\\" when Pike was captain.<br /><br />Supposedly these discrepancies with earlier Star Treks are explained by Nero's destruction of the timeline, thus creating a parallel universe that we see in the movie, but that too is inconsistent with Star Trek's use of time in past series and movies, and also many of these discrepancies exist before Nero's actions or would not be explained by a timeline change. To explain what I mean by it being an inconsistency, in the TOS episode \\"City On the Edge of Forever\\" Star Trek's concept of time is made clear when McCoy went back to the past and makes a substantial change, which caused the future to vanish. His actions did NOT create an alternate universe as happens in this movie. I don't believe that anyone understands time well enough to say which result would actually happen if we could travel back in time and make some big change, but this movie's concept of time is NOT the established Star Trek concept of time. As far as I know, and I DON'T know all the Star Trek episodes of the more recent TV series, I believe that Star Trek has adhered to that basic concept of time as set forth in the original series. Until 2009's STAR TREK.<br /><br />At any rate, even if I am wrong that this movie violates Star Trek's established use of time, should fans accept these huge changes to Star Trek history, even IF this movie's explanation of those changes makes sense? I say NO!! I speculate that the director and writers and producer of this movie really didn't want to make a \\"Star Trek\\" movie AT ALL, yet they HAD to because they were commissioned to make a Star Trek movie. Therefore, they took a basic Star Trek background then went off in their own direction.<br /><br />Some other aspects of this movie also bother me. For one, I agree with the reviewers who see it as absurd that Kirk is made captain of the Enterprise at the end of this movie. Not only is he depicted here as impulsive and arrogant, but he has no experience as an officer and has not even graduated from Star Fleet Academy! Another scene that I found to be unreasonable was the one where Spock nearly strangled Kirk to death on the bridge. After such an incident of out-of-control rage, Spock should have been removed as captain. In the original Star Trek series, the only time that Spock displayed such a lack of self-control (in \\"Amok Time,\\" \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" and \\"All Our Yesterdays\\") was when he was under the influence of forces beyond his control. Another problem with the scene where Spock nearly strangled Kirk to death is that a large group of crew members just STOOD THERE AND WATCHED!! Finally, Spock's father calmly says, \\"Spock\\" and everyone lets Spock decide whether he's going to kill Kirk or not. I can understand the dramatic desire to have Spock make the decision of what he will do, but it's not reasonable that all those people would just stand there and let him kill Kirk.<br /><br />The next Trek movie is coming out in about a week, again directed by J.J. Abrams as this one was. Unless I hear good explanations that it's a lot better than 2009's STAR TREK, I'm not going to go see it.

193700788X|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  If I had to sum it up in one word, I would call it dispassionate.  There was too much focus on bringing back every character that had previously passed through Sookie's life and not enough focus on the relationships that really mattered.  This was Sookie without a soul...perhaps a devil took it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book started out good, but suddenly got great.  Certainly a page turner although it turned out to be a sort of cynical ending.  Good read!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|There were so many examples, details, and data-supported facts that Sheryl shared that helped to force me think about how I act and how others act to enable gender discrimination. The awareness will make me happier in my personal and professional life. I fully intend to share this book will all working and non working men and women who will listen.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Most people probably know the storyline of the Downton Abbeys series by now. As for the DVD, it arrived on time and works as expected. We will probably rewatch this series many times in the coming years.
1416955070|1.0|I usually don't write reviews but I really felt the need to because I disliked the book that much. I read the book after I saw the movie preview. I love all things supernatural, paranormal, and the like. With that being said, I just knew I would love this book. I won't give a synopsis of the book because there's already one included in the details of this page but I must admit that I loved the premise. I actually started writing a book last year(before I had ever heard of this), very similar to this. The premise was the 0NLY thing I liked about the book. It just seems poorly executed to me. The characters were so whiny and one-dimensional, maybe they're that way because they're teenagers. Maybe 26 year old women like myself aren't considered as part of the YA target audience but I digress. The main character, Clary was whiny, helpless, and extremely annoying. The villain, Valentine had no real depth or motivation other than his extreme hatred of Downworlders. The book was so predictable it was ridiculous. The cliche love-triangle was even underdeveloped and fell flat. As a matter of fact, I predicted most of the major events throughout the trilogy. I really wanted to like this series so I read City of Ashes as well and it was more of the same. More whining(sp?) and predictable plots. Save yourselves the disappointment and read something else.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I was surprised that this movie summed up the storyline but they did a pretty decent job.  All in all an excellent animated movie.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|awesome game but hate that u have to pay for stuff. grafics are nice. its kind of like temple nrun but flying and with weapons
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a book that I started to read, and didn't like the fact that the font was different than all my other books on my kindle fire, so I put it down and did pick it back up for months. Once  I started reading it again, I was captivated and couldn't wait to read what was next. Edge of your seat and hard to put down type of a book. You fall in love with sky and holder and it feels like you have know them your whole life. What a wonderful book and author. Thank you Colleen Hoover!!
0316017930|5.0|This book was fascinating and having started three businesses, I found that the theories/statistics/stories are helpful to a wide range of business people.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell's books are also very entertaining and you'll enjoy it for just that as well:  entertainment.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|The quality of the restoration is pretty good on this.  Yes you can tell a difference between this and the 10th anniversary DVD edition.  They also kept the original 4:3 format.  There aren't a lot of extras in this blu-ray unfortunately but it is worth the purchase if you had it on DVD or if you are looking to add to your anime.  I realize there are so many ninja and samurai films and series out now but this is one of the essentials.
0316010669|4.0|Mr. Gladwell makes reading a joy.  Don't hestitate to pick this up for reading on a plane, at the beach, on a lazy Sunday.
B007UQRW62|5.0|Since this is a review of the product I'll keep the movie part brief.  This movie(musical) was really wonderfully executed and written using the time period when silent movies were transitioning into &#34;talkies&#34;.  What is wonderful is the underlying love story which blends wonderfully with the other aspects of the story.  I don't ever realize during the movie that this is a musical.  I'm just watching a really good story.  This one stands the test of time for me and you just don't realize how much it has influenced entertainment today.<br /><br />This package is wonderful.  If you don't mind having a big box in your collection it's a keeper.  The actuall blu-ray case is in the packaging so you can just put the movie in your shelf without the entire box package.  I love the extras that come with this and the umbrella is the exclamation point on it.  It is not a flimsy one either and would consider using it if it wasn't the only one I had.  If you are a big fan of this film it would be worth saving and getting this edition.  It is only slightly bigger than the Casablanca packaging.  The restoration is very good as well.  I believe even the hardcore videophiles would like the quality.
193700788X|1.0|I'm so glad I didn't preorder this book. I've bought and read (and reread) the first 11 books and always looked forward to each new book. I lost interest after the 11th book but was going to get the last two just to see the whole series through. After reading the reviews, I know not to waste my time and money. I understand that it's a writers prerogative to write her characters as she sees fits, but it's also a writer's responsibility to be consistent within the framework she has created. You can take a 300 pound couch potato who wants to be a ballerina and transform her into one over the course of a series, but you can't have her be a couch potato almost the whole time and then suddenly turn her into a prima ballerina at the very end without explanation. (Silly example, I know, but you get my point). It doesn't make sense and it's just bad writing. I'm grateful to Charlaine Harris for creating these wonderful characters, I just wish she had given them an ending that was consistent with the rest of the storyline.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Enjoyable while disturbing story of two lost souls longing for happiness. Their lives are complete when they unexpected find each other.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I can't believe this is the final book in the series. I really love Charlaine Harris writing style in all of her novels but especially love Sookie Stackhouse. Nobody writes quite like Charlaine Harris. This book was great and Charlaine wrapped up the series very nicely. The beginning of the book was outside of her typical writing style but was well executed. Harris gave us a little bit of all my favorite characters in this final book with a surprise ending; I LOVED IT!<br />I look forward to the start of a new series from Harris......
B006G2124E|5.0|Me and my husband watched this movie on our amazon tv app and it was amazing! Some parts make you mad, some sad, some happy, and some parts will leave you laughing knowing people got what they deserved. LOVE IT!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I ordered a couple of copies for my mother-in-law and her mother, and they haven't stopped thanking me for introducing me to this show. Still haven't seen it myself, but if you need gifts for your in-laws, give this one a try. :)
193700788X|1.0|Such an epic disappointment. Not that I expected much after the last couple of books, but I thought CH might bring out the big guns for the final book. Looks like she dragged out a water pistol.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Yes, I'm an Eric fan and I would have liked to see them somehow have their HEA...But...I am reasonable enough to realise that that probably wasn't going to happen. First, let me say that I've read hundreds of these reviews. I truly wanted to see if the way I was feeling was just me or the general feeling amongst the fan base. What I've found and what really annoys me is the presumption by some of the 5 star fans (and they've actually mentioned it) that we're all bitching about Eric. NO, we're not. Again and again (ex)fans are saying the same thing...the gist of which is that while it's disappointing that Sookie didn't end up with Eric, we could have accepted it if there had been ANY logical build up to Sam. We're saying that the book was sloppily thrown together; that CH had an ending in mind at around book 2 and so-help-her she was ending it that way even if the story and characters had really found a voice of their own and diverged from that ending...she was going to finagle, forget continuity, change lore, anything to get her ending; that the premise/mystery was poorly thought out and that CH threw anyone that had ever been in the books into the mix to act as filler with no real need for them to be there (especially as she's supposedly letting us know all their ever-afters in the coda out in October). I won't go into all the errors in the book (because so many other reviewers have) but I have to seriously question her publisher, continuity specialist and editor. How did all the errors get passed them? Did they even read it before sending it to print?<br /><br />I'm incredibly disappointed that there was no real, mature and emotional \\"ending\\" for Eric and Sookie. OK, so they couldn't be together...so let them have a mature discussion and have them realise that, say their goodbyes, voice their regrets...goddamn it...just a bloody hug would have been nice (no pun intended)....but noooo, we have an emotionally immature reaction from Sookie (and a totally out of character threatening, sulky attitude from Eric) and a slamming door. Real mature *snort*. Oh yes, I can certainly see how Sookie has matured through the series, NOT! And no, I'm not saying Eric doesn't have his faults, and realistically Sookie probably needed a \\"man\\" who could live with her in the sun, father children etc, but I'd rather have seen her alone than settling for Sam. Because settle she did. Nice safe, boring Sam.<br /><br />CH has made no bones about the fact that she's never understood the fans love of Eric. What I can't understand is that she created and wrote him as a heroic, but flawed, bad-boy character, with dazzling good looks, a ready smirk and grin, a sense of humour, a real presence, and a habit of taking bullets for Sookie. He never hid his true nature. What you saw, is what you got. Yes, he hid vampire related information from Sookie but at least he always told her the truth when he could. And lets not forget the \\"gracious plenty\\" and what he could do with it. What did she expect us to do? What's not to like? Sookie fell in love with him, why wouldn't we?<br /><br />After the promise of the first 8/9 books, the progress Sookie made in accepting herself and making an effort to grow and learn, it was sad to see what many thought of as such a promising heroine close herself off to possibilities. To slide back into her mundane little existence and her mundane little job; to a relationship with someone who never gave her the credit due her intelligence, treated her like a child and generally took her a bit for granted. But in saying that, I never really liked Sookie all that much anyway. I never saw what ever Eric, Alcide, Quinn and Bill did. I found her childish, self-centred, whiney, ungrateful, self-righteous,hypocritical and sanctimonious. I could go on...and on. Probably the only redeeming qualities I found in her, were her loyalty and tolerance...but even those qualities became questionable towards the end. On a side note - I also have to wonder about CH's ideas on rape. How could she have Sookie forgive, be friendly with and even kiss her rapist????? Bit of a slap in the face for victims everywhere. Just saying!<br /><br />I only continued reading the series (and paying out good money) because of the developing relationship with Eric. He's the one who enticed me to keep reading the series. He's probably the greatest character she'll ever create and she destroyed him (and in my mind Sookie as well). So a big boo to Ms Harris for her treatment of him in the last book and for the piss-poor writing effort that so obviously showed to me that she didn't really care after about book 9 or so. I can even understand her wanting to move on/feeling resentment if she felt forced (contractually obligated) to continue writing after a certain point...but she should have done her best to give us, her readers and paying customers, the best she had to offer...not because we expected it, or deserved it, or whatever...but because she's supposed to be a professional. But, alas, it was not to be. I'm never picking up another book of hers again. Wouldn't risk having another series of hers end in the same disappointment. Find your HEA in fanfic. There's some fantastic, well written, well thought out stories... and they won't cost you a thing!<br /><br />ONE FINAL WORD<br /><br />This is quoted from a reader on the Sookieverse site...and I think it sums up everything...<br /><br />\\"In my fictional world - you don't settle for tomatoes, creeps like ALO don't win, rapists don't make good friends, love is worth fighting for, every day is a new possibility, the most meaningful acceptance you can find is within yourself, what makes you different is embraced and it is never wrong to follow your heart or hope for MORE.

B00BC0JI6O|5.0|Another must have for prog fans.the addition of  Ted Leonard from the band Enchant really makes this one stand out. I also highly recommend Neal Morse's Momentum equally as good.
193700788X|2.0|I just read the book and I did not like the ending. From book 5 Sookie was involved with Eric and he did grow on me. I didn't think this last book did him any justice. He is greedy and even don't want Sookie to be happy with anybody else. It doesn't match. Now he wants power even though in other books it was clear that he was happy to be the sheriff and nothing more. Otherwise he could have tried for King himself when Sophie-Ann was hurt. But he didn't want that. And suddenly everything between them is over. Sookie is of no importance to any vampire anymore.<br /><br />Even though I was expecting it to be Sam I still think that the inspiration for the books was allready gone 2 books ago. What a shame. Normally when I like a serie I read it several times. But this one I will put up for sale and not read it again. The ending just doesn't match the rest of the books.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 4 year old loves this movie. Knows it from beginning to end. Act out all the scenes. He's a train lover. The movie was fun to watch. I enjoyed it with my son.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Love the movie. So glad to finally own it. It came in the mail on the exact day it was expected to arrive. Brand spanking new in the original packaging. Couldn't be happier unless Bradley Cooper himself hand-delivered it to my door! Haha!
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was a good way to end the book however I am sad the series is over. I loved the way the books were written. Good job Charlaine!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really hoped the series would end with a little bite to it and me wishing the series wouldn't end, sadly not the case. I knew several books back I should stop reading but I have a hard time not finishing a book or series, even if they suck. It felt like Harris wrote a story she didn't care about and wanted to disapoint most of the fan base. Hence my wasted time I will never get back.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|A truly great performance by George Clooney.Shows what a great and diverse actor he is.  A classic off-beat comedy. Great sound track as well.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Although the this movie starts off with a great beginning, it seemed to fall short in the long run. Maybe it was me, but I was a bit dissapointed all in all.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The singing was good. I just wish that it was a complete soundtrack and not just selected songs from the movie.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Simple Review:<br /><br />This movie will speak to all of us who were quiet in school, who maybe had some hurts that they didn't express, who cared deeply for those around them. More than a decade after high school, I can still relate. There's a bit of the \\"wallflower\\" in me still.<br /><br />The story is light-hearted on the surface, but some of you will be able to see what's going on from the beginning. Even if you don't pick up on the dark undertones, this movie will still make you feel good. The story is well-written, and will keep your attention. The characters are interesting and relate-able. The ending is a happy one.<br /><br />I just ordered the book.

B006LSZECO|5.0|There was no way the reader could not feel the plight, emotions and disfunction of the characters. Solid writing with just enough detail. I have to admit it had a Scott and Lacey Petterson resemblance to it, which was creepy. I'm an avid reader, I read this book about a month ago and I still have flashbacks to it. The ending line is priceless!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Too short and too plain needs to be longer. Good start...not enough of the other characters nor the perp. Or the cops
B00867GJYK|5.0|Love this movie and now I have it on DVD and Blue Ray! Disney need to come out with Finding Dory NOW!!! Stop with the teasing of 2015...
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I loved this movie! I read the book a couple of years ago so I don't remember every detail of the book but I do know they changed a lot of things...and I still loved it!<br />You can't expect a movie to be exactly like the book and this book is very detailed so it's impossible to fit everything in the movie. I think they did a great job with the time they had, there not allowed to make a 10 hour long movie to fit everything in.<br />Not going to lie I did have some issues with the movie when I first saw the trailer, I didn't really like the 2 main actors. And I thought Ethan's accent was way to heavy in the first 5 minutes but I got used to it. I fell in love with Lena and Ethan I thought they were so cute!<br />******spoiler*****<br />I was about to have a fit at the end when he forgot about her and was just going to leave town like that!!!Thank God he remembered! UGH I just really loved it!<br />it was a great film and people should have an open mind about it :)

B00AS1Q93S|4.0|There seems to be two camps of response to this film: those who have read the novel `One Shot' by Lee Child and have trouble with the casting and those who come to the film without knowledge of the `character Jack Reacher. Not having read the book this viewer found the film intensely engrossing, full of smart dialogue form writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, and a finely tuned cast of actors who get the opportunity to strut their stuff in this story that seems far shorter than the 130 minutes of the film. Tom Cruise may be short in stature at 5'7\\" but at age 50 he is in fine shape, performs all his own car stunts (which are excellent and harrowing), and at least for the novice he does `become' Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Briefly, the setting is Pittsburgh, PA and a professional sniper (an exceptionally fine Jai Courtney) shoots dead five seemingly random people. The police quickly capture on James Barr (Joseph Sikora), arrest him, interrogate him (by DA Richard Jenkins and his cohort David Oyelowo and the DA's lawyer daughter Rosamund Pike who seeks to give Barr a fair trial): Barr declares his innocence and his answer to his question of is he guilty is his writing `Get Jack Reacher'. Barr is beaten unconscious in a van on the way to jail and is comatose.  Jack Reacher, ex-military investigator, (Tom Cruise) who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history appears and the action begins. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a second look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.<br /><br />In addition to the actors mention, there are several excellent cameos by Werner Herzog as a Russian ex-prisoner who knows about survival (he chewed of his own fingers while I prison to ward off gangrene from frost bite), Alexia Fast, Josh Helman, Vladimir Sizov, and Robert Duvall. The story is rich in innuendoes, insights into corporate greed and threats form outside sources to take over the country, and some serious chases both by car and on foot.  The brilliant cinematography is by Caleb Deschanel and the atmosphere is greatly enhanced by the musical score by Joe Kraemer.  But this is a Tom Cruise special and he proves he can still rule the roost as one of the top action heroes in the business. For this genre, this is a fine entertainment.

B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|A member of my strategy game group broke this out recently, as a quick filler to end the night. We thought it was horribly dumb...and we couldn't stop laughing while playing it. While not my usual type of game, it was a lot of fun.<br /><br />In Love Letter, you're trying to get a letter to the princess. Your letter will be passed from person to person; when the deck runs out, whoever has the princess (or the person closest to her) wins the round. The round can (and often does) also end early if all but one player is out.<br /><br />Play is simple. You have one card in your hand, draw another card, and play one of the two. Each card has a special ability, such as letting you look at someone else's hand, or comparing your hand with someone else's (where whoever has the lower card is out of the round). There's a little bit of thinking involved, as you try to guess what cards everyone else holds so that you can choose your targets correctly, but it's largely luck-based. It wouldn't work at all as a longer game, but for a humorous filler it's pretty decent. I'm not sure how it would stand up to more plays, though.<br /><br />Aside from the cards, the game comes with a nice bag and an instruction booklet that largely consists of backstory explaning how the cards go together.

B0084IG7KC|4.0|The movie follows the book fairly well, considering that Hollywood generally screws up a good thing in the process of making a movie out of a great novel.  The blue ray disc is a very good product, but the digital copy down load time was too long... several hours too long.  I'm looking forward to &#34;Catching Fire&#34;, out sometime soon.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Very polished UI. The magazine view is a great way to present posts for preview. The article de-clutter option works better than Silk's own article viewing mode. Can't comment on the sharing and linking as I don't use them but it's a great way to aggregate and view feeds.
B005FPT51K|5.0|I have two of these.  I bought the first one a couple of years ago for our first child and now we have another child and need for another monitor. This monitor is really easy to use.  Not sure about the problems people are having, but it works great for OSX or for Windows.  For OSX you can use any device or you can use any web browser.  The included IPTool will look for your device on OSX and then launch the web browser with the ip address and port you set up.  It works great.  Also, since I have multiple monitors, I can switch easily between them on my iphones, ipads, or templates.  I can also access my monitors anywhere by using the DDNS address (on the bottom of the camera) using any browser, so you don't even need the software to give your relatives access.  One thing to keep in mind is that the access is not encrypted via [...]  When you use it in house, your encryption is done via your wireless settings...  The directions are a bit weird, but not hard if you have any technical ability.  Even so, a few tips:<br /><br />1. When you set your camera up, make your IP address static.  That way, your port and address are set.  DHCP takes time, and so does the registry for DDNS, so this might frustrate some people going from wired to wireless. Setting it to static will keep everything, well, static and you won't have to wait for the camera to setup and everything else to update.<br />2. You will need to reboot the device (unplug) when going from wired to wireless so that it resets the connection.  When it does not detect a wired connection, it will then go to wireless.<br />3. To switch back and forth between the two devices, hit the setup button on the IOS device to switch.  On any machine, just open a new tab in the browser with the correct ip settings...something like either [...] <<-replace here with valid information.<br /><br />It does not tell temperature or humidity.  It does:<br /><br />1. Monitor in darkness or light<br />2. Passthrough audio (you cannot speak into it - no two way comm)<br />3. Movement alerts<br />4. Connections to passthrough audio<br />5. Connections to home alarm system<br />6. dynamic DNS service to access anywhere if your router supports uPnP<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Setup<br />2. Access anywhere with any platform<br />3. Multiple monitors are easily managed<br />4. Flexible config<br />5. Audio monitoring<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Requires some technical knowledge<br />2. No temperature gauge (maybe???)<br />3. No two way audio native but through 1/8\\" jacks in the back<br />4. No music passthrough<br /><br />In any case, it works terrific.  As I mentioned, I have two of these and it's really convenient.  I have had the Sony and the Phillips and some others.  Temp guage is important, but I have a more accurate one in the infant room.  I've noticed the baby monitor temp gauges are usually off by anywhere from 3-11 degrees, so I didn't find it useful - just panic causing (omg the baby's room is 85 degrees!!! - nope, the monitor was just plain wrong...)...<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful.

B008N1V11U|5.0|They just need games to play like dark knight and Spider-Man, let's see green lantern, hulk, 're do captain America just like this...put more in this one
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|I saw people complaining about the voice... you can change the pitch of the voice, and if you use the UK voice it is a lot more bearable.  From the few documents I've opened, it does read them with out too may issues.  Does it sound like an audio book MP3?  No, the inflection is still not up to that level.  Does it read what is in the PDF / epub file?  Ya, it seemed to work well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a powerful story. You are loved and cherished, you have nothing to fear and there is nothing you can do wrong...let those words sink in. I found the sentence explaining how Dr. Alexander came to \\"hear\\" those words to be extremely moving.<br /><br />I purchased the kindle version of this book.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I like it. You will enjoy playing this game. Can't wait to get the next game: Jewel Legends 2. Good games.
1449410243|5.0|Love it. Written exactly like his comics online. This is what I expected and it cracked me up! I love the format it comes in on the Kindle. It makes reading it on an e-reader very simple.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's an ok game. Kinda slow pace and confusing to try to remember where you have put all the buildings at.
B00BI745AA|4.0|I thought maybe, the movie could have used a little less singing, which would have shortened the length of the movie.<br /> But otherwise very good movie.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|GREAT GREAT GREAT SERIES OF MOVIES BASED ON ROBERT PARKER BOOKS.  LOVED ALL OF THEM, HAVE EVEN WATCHED THEM ALL IN ORDER ON THE WEEKENDS, JUST LOVE TOM SELLECK AND HE IS A REALLY REALLY GREAT JESSE STONE.  DON'T MISS THESE MOVIES, YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DO!!!  I'M REALLY HOPING HE CONTINUES TO MAKE THESE MOVIES.  I WILL BUY THEM ALL!!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I have enjoyed this entire series up until this book. I will never buy another Charlaine Harris novel. A lot of readers are angry that Sookie ends up with Sam instead of Eric. I actually didn't have a preference on the HEA couple. My outrage at this book stems from the blatant lack of thought, character development and pure neglect of the story. It is obvious that Mrs. Harris didn't put a fourth of the effort she put into previous books into this one. The characters and their behavior was not consistent with the characters I have come to love. There were multiple times where she contradicted facts she had given in previous books. There was a general lack of depth and insight. By far the worst book of the series and possibly the worst book I've ever read. Shame on you Mrs. Harris! Your fans were expecting the quality that you have been releasing and we got a major dud. Next time you grow so bored with a series, at least hire a ghost writer to put in the effort an ending deserves.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Visually beautiful. Character driven. Fantastic story of the journey from fear to adventure. I've yet to tire of it after watching it over and over for many years. A great starting place for those who are skeptical of the virtues of animated storytelling.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House.  This is an excellent book about this time in history. It kept me reading with each page.  It showed the hardships the salves had to deal with, and the love they all shared.  Great book!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game it doesn't seem as if should be as exciting as it is, but it really keeps me going.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a great game love it its so much fun plus its free I loved temple run but temple run to is awesome
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have been a fan of this series for several years. I agree with what seems to be a common consensus, that the past few books have just not been up to the<br />standards of the earlier ones. I started reading Dead Ever After with cautious optimism. I had read previously that Charlaine Harris knew how the series was going to end for quite a while. I was assuming that this would allow for a fitting, satisfying end for Sookie.<br />  I was wrong. From the beginning, the book does not feel like the last book in a long series. It just did not feel epic enough. So many other epic things have happened in the series. In the entire book, the whole plot came down to, people are trying to kill Sookie.<br />  Characters from the past seem to reintroduced for no real reason, except to have them appear in the last book.<br />  The closure that I was hoping for in Sookie's love life just didn't happen. After reading about the Sookie/Bill/Eric triangle for so long, it was ended so badly. Things with Eric were handled awfully. Things with Bill were handled awfully also.  I understood Charlaine's choice for Sookie at the end, but it could have been done so much better.<br />  Just so sad that the series is over, and that it ended on such a bizarre note. Maybe After Dead will makes things a little better!
B00BUL0IHI|1.0|would have loved the track but it feels like the same old same.. lil Wayne is all about the horrible language. no talent
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really enjoyed the final book in this series. I can't believe so called fans are hating on Charlaine for ending it like she did, it's her world and I'm glad I got to be part of it! I will probably read the whole series again many times!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game, even my 3 yr old can play it it's that easy! My husband and I live it as well!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved the characters in this book and enjoyed reading about the war. I will be reading the sequel to this book
B00BQHA06A|4.0|I have been a fan of HIM I was in high school and i will forever be a fan of HIM. Its been about three years i believe since ive heard anything new from them and when i found out they were coming out with their 8th album i just had to get it.<br /><br />As soon as I got it I just hurried and downloaded it on my ipod. Listened to it for the first time I was like ok now i hear a little bit of all their albums put together. I was a bit upset that most of the songs were instrumental but they were good.<br /><br />Two days I have the album playing on my ipod and all the songs started to be catchy. I love how Into The Night Starts out. Tears on Tape I just sing along to. Im still trying to learn all the songs by heart.<br /><br />If I were to say should this be the first album to get if you were a newbie to the HIM world...to me NO I would probably say get Greatest Lovesongs Vol 666 or Razorblade Romance ( I fell in love with Razorblade Romance). All of their albums are different in their own way but you will just love them no matter if it sounds poppy. Ville brings life to his music and once you hear that voice you just can't stop listening to HIM.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Too many words for too little of a story. The first book was so much better, the following two were fillers..
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I first happened upon this book last year after finding it as the first pick of Oprah's 2.0 book club. I was just looking for something to read. I wasn't expecting it. It broke me apart and changed and inspired me. My own mother had died of cancer when I was 23 and I didn't know where I belonged in the world - I only knew my life would have two parts, When I Had a Mom and What Happened After.  Cheryl Strayed's articulation of the shock, loss, attempts at soothing her wounds and her self preservation and inner voice that led her to her incredible adventure on the Pacific Crest Trail was raw and real, beautiful in it's honesty. The way she took ownership of her life, faced her challenges head-on ready or not, and became so different and so strong and at peace in the process is incredible to read. She so closely voiced every emotion I have felt myself, in such a pure and clear way that this story will always feel like home to me, and Cheryl an old friend. I am sure that countless people have felt the same way - this book's popularity is a testament to it's ability to touch so many. Read it - it's a joy.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I enjoyed this book as well. I am from the area that Miss Strade began her journey and I know the PCT so reading this was both familiar and the story was well done.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved it. Typical Nicholas Sparks. Not as sappy as some of his other books. Easy read too and very enjoyable.
0440180295|2.0|I first came across this book in the 60s when all my young peers were raving about it.  Even then, when I read it I was surprised how thin and shallow it was.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci is awesome. You fall in love with Robie. Very well written. Baldacci is at the top of my &#34;must read&#34; list.
1449437524|5.0|About once a month I go to the online version of the comic from which this book is taken, just to  laugh a laugh of recognition and get a little teary eyed over the memory of a long passed canine friend. So when I saw that this book would become available I pre-ordered two: One for me and one for a pair of friends who taught me to love dogs.<br /><br />This book is a must for anyone who has ever loved a dog.<br /><br />I love this book.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|It's ok. I started this book last year but put it down. Finally I picked it back up and continued reading it several months later. It's predictable.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The Amazing SPIDER-MAN. Favorite hero, fvorite game, favorite app. I was surprised to see SPIDER-MAN In a good quality app. Simply Amazing.
B000SEI230|4.0|Very enjoyable read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book even if it's a little sappy. Sparks is on my &#34;Must Read&#34; list.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The acting and the messages were so moving. I think many of us could relate to these people's lives. It made you laugh and cry at the same time
0451197879|1.0|For me, this book was 300 pages of monotony. That's the best way to put it. Now that I've finished it I will never open it again. Why did the publisher spend money to print this? I can usually find something good to say about a book and with this one I can't. I'm just glad it's over with.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I feel bad saying it, as I'm a fan of Ben and his gorgeous family, but just didn't care for this story, which is a highly fictionalized interpretation of Iran hostage situation (which happened when I was a teenager, and unfortunately I don't remember much of).  The beginning of the story was gripping; didn't like the way the movie was shot, emphasized facial closeups, which I don't particularly like in film, but I'm still a fan of Bens, so maybe I'll like his next better.  Keep'em coming, please.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Loved this movie and I recommend seeing the prior 2 movies before watching this one so u don't miss out on anything. Great Action flick. thumbs up.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game. Easy to play and very easy to get hooked very very easily on it. You can spend hours playing. I do!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is awesome!!!!!!!! :-) I love it! Just the storyline and I am looking forward to reading The House of Hades when it comes out.
0553801473|5.0|Glancing at the ratings for his 5 books in the series, one would think these are just \\"good\\" books. They are masterpieces. 1-3 & 5 were slam-dunk 5 star books. They were every bit as good as the Asimov Foundation and Robot Series, better than Frank Herbert's Dune masterpieces; in fact some of the best sci-fi/fantasy I have ever read. Note I did not mention Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. As it was my intro into science fiction (after Andre Norton's great Daybreak: 2250) it will hold a special place and no flaw, other than the running after Saruman's orcs for chapters, will be heard by me. I also left volume 4 for last. I am probably the wrong person to ask. Basically, most of the characters in that book were ones I did not like much (\\"the villains\\", more or less). Since my favorite characters had little roles I  rated it was a 4. Book #5 started BOOM and was a 5 star all the way through.because it returned to the complete story, slowly advanced the story significantly, explained moves by each of the players of GOT, brought back a couple players thought removed and left us hanging with the mother of all cliffhangers. Get it, get it quick, keep it safe.....shu
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|He is my favorite singers and he outdid himself on this one .  Beautiful music, well put together  Would r recommend

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought this primarily to throw into my backpack or camping gear when I go out.  It does a decent job of putting a quick, fairly clean edge on my pocket knife, long enough to keep it cutting like I expect it to.  The two different bits, one carbide, and one ceramic, do a good job of bringing the blade down to a good point, but nowhere near as precisely as a flat stone.  I would not call this a replacement for a diamond kit or real stone, but it is not a bad temporary sharpener.  I am old fashioned and still prefer a nice stone, but I am actually thinking of switching over to one of the man made stones like the ones from DMT or Smith's for my regular sharpening at home.  If you need something to keep a reasonable edge on a knife you use in the field and don't have the time or access to a larger sharpener, then this is a good buy and I definitely recommend it.  I can't give it 5 stars just because it allows the blade to wiggle a little more than I prefer, but otherwise, a good product.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this app as it allows you to find out instantly how much battery life you have left for each activity and would recommend it to anyone

B004856SQ8|5.0|Love this movie.<br />I was about 50% a fan of the old TV show ... and I dislike Bradly Cooper (can anyone say OVERrated?). But the other actors are awesome ...<br /><br />... and who doesn't love, Liam Nessom?  Who doesn't?  I pity that fool, specifically.

B005OT2YVA|5.0|Can't get enough of it! Usually, after the first and second parts they come out with, the movies tend to not be as good, but so far &#34;Transformers&#34; has been great.
193700788X|1.0|Many other people have already provided good summaries about why this book sucks.  The poor writing, unexplained changes in abilities, story lines that make no sense and go nowhere, pages and pages of Sookie doing the dishes and shopping that are BORING and pointless to the story, etc etc etc.  The whole book is just a stream of conscious as we follow Sookie through her boring days with no structure or plot to the story. If this was the first book in the series, she never would have sold any of the sequels!  In fact, I went back to the first book and re-read just to confirm I hadn't imagined that Ms. Harris could actually write a good story.<br /><br />A lot of complaints about the books are concerned with who Sookie ends up with.  I couldn't care less except to agree that her sudden relationship with Sam makes no sense.  No, what continues to bother me most about these books is the illogical and annoying product placement of brand products that appear throughout the book with no logical connection to the story.  Within the first part of the book alone there are references to Cola-Cola, Outback, Walmart, Jolly Green Giant, Weather Channel, and Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup to name just a few.<br /><br />I figure Ms. Harris has probably made so much money from these product placements that she doesn't need my money so I RETURNED the book!!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Chris Evans is a great actor and plays a great superhero! And who does't love a great superhero movie these days.
B00BOL126U|5.0|This show is SO awesome. It's very dark (love it), has incredibly believable acting by Travis Fimmel (HOT!!).. those two things, along with another brilliantly written piece from Michael Hirst (Tudors, anyone!?) oooh I'm all in =)
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This book was amazing and there was so much suspense it was the best especially the ending a amazing book
B009NY43NY|1.0|Spoiler****<br />The book still ends with no true resolution... o happy ever after with one love... I am sookie and I'll be okay... just lame... looks like she just got bored writing....  anyone rating this book wouldn't give one star if they weren't required to....
B0055PMURG|1.0|Wonderful story.  Told in a sick(ly) sweet, ridiculous way.  Why be so unreal, when you are dealing with an actual incredible true story? Don't waste your time. Maybe there will be a remake one day that does this girl's story justice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it was really really fun for young people like me...best way to kill time and chill...enjoy it peoples<br /><br />  ~J M

B00845PT18|2.0|(Spoilers? Only a little, but yes.)<br /><br />Ghost Rider 2! I loved the first movie! It was awesome! It was so cool! the story was good, the romance, the comedy, the graphics, the actors (Nicholas Cage was awesome), everything. loved.<br />So you can probably guess how excited I was for 2.<br />But I was let down after watching it. Ghost Rider 2 is good, but not no where near as good as the first movie in my opinion.<br />Nicholas was once again, amazing like always, but I didn't like any of the other actors. I couldn't believe there acting. Also the change of the 'satan' actor was a 'woah, why?' moment for me. (And I was hoping they would have at least said something about the girl from movie 1, but they didn't.)<br />But that's not the only thing I disliked about this movie.<br />The graphics where poor imo. Sure, Ghost Rider did look cool with the more detail to the skull and burnt look, but thats about it for me.<br />And the story was another one of thos cliche 'mom and and boy on the run from bad guys and must be saved' type of stories I have seen a million times.<br /><br />Overall the movie was good, but I was honestly expecting more.<br /><br />If your not really expecting anything majorly epic or awesome (like me), just your avrg awesome, and just want to see more Ghost Rider, of course you should watch it. =]
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I prefer Jump Desktop to Splash Top and others I've tried. With two phones, three tablets and two PC,s on board, it performs flawlessly.<br />While sound would be nice (only for watching movies) it's not necessary. The interface is easy to follow and set-up is painless. Great job!
B00005QZWI|5.0|You can't go wrong with Howard Shore composition! A fantastic score to go with an equally fantastic film. Thumbs up!
B009VB7QQA|1.0|So, on a lark I rented this.  I'm a huge fan of bad movies, but this was just terrible.  Lousy action, lousy acting, lame plot.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I went to the movie theatre to see this concert and went very skeptical, I went with the thought that if the band was not good I was not going to watch the performance because I wanted to remember the band as they were. When I was 16 I saw the band perform in Oklahoma City in 1977, I have always felt lucky to have seen the band play live. Well, I was blown away by the concert, almost brought tears to my eyes. The band's last concert was definately one to remember and in my opinion they left on top and in great form. It was inspiring to see this band at their age, to be able to still perform their craft with precision, and it was great to see them having fun performing, they knew they had it that night and they played with great confidence. I knew from seeing the concert in the movie theatre that the Blu Ray DVD would be awesome as well, and it did not disappoint. Must have for your music DVD collection, I have watched this DVD alot and enjoy it every time.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Lots of fun and easy to play.  It is as much fun as the original game. We would like to see more like it.<br />Thanks
0307352153|5.0|Growing up in an Asian society, children were always taught not to talk or share too much of their own opinions while adults were talking. Being humble is considered a key to showing mature behavior. Most Asians admire how American kids speak their minds without much hesitation. And, a related issue in the context of the competitions of society, individuals have to conquer their fear of public speaking - requiring, to some degree, an assertive nature. But, we also understand the need for people to only talk, raising their particular point(s) in the right place and time.<br /><br />A clear line between the introvert and extrovert is diminished to me. I agree with the premise that, individuals with a great professional reputation or standing, unique idea or special position can and should talk about their specialties with confidence and not be shy. In fact, in recent years, I've also observed many young people in the context of their work and studies in Asia are becoming less shy as they've acquired more experience with the competitions of work and society in general. But I also appreciate the ethical and philosophical tenets of Confucianism are still being respected and that is how we value the interaction of people and ideas - and their presentation - in harmony.<br /><br />This book definitely helped me to contemplate the characteristics of introverted people and relations with them, while prompting the reflection to know more about myself. I certainly can understand the author's passion for the topic and their comprehensive study from diverse perspectives.

0765357151|5.0|I saw the movie first and was pretty engrossed in the film. It may have been because Will Smith is one of my favorite actors of all time or its because, I would like to think, it's that the movie was unlike any other movies of its kind Ive ever seen or heard of. To me the movie was really great. So once I heard this movie originated from a book I took interest in reading the book. Lets just say after reading the book I was pissed to see how the movie was ACTUALLY originally from one of the greatest horror books ever. When I read this book it made me wish that someone would revamp this movie and make it true to the actual events in this book. The book to me was so much more realistic of a person going through this supposed post-zombie/vampire apocalyptic society than the movie. The substance of the book and the ending is so much better than the movie, and i still really like this movie. Its a must read for EVERYONE. Even if your not a horror junkie. Please read it! Even though it sounds ridiculous but this book will make you realize how good \\"we\\" have it right now in life and society...however much longer it will last...AWESOME BOOK!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a must read for fans of the show. While the television show is very good there is a lot of insight and background to be found in the book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is just that, a game. It is enjoyable and fun. I find that you make money buy not completely exiting the game, which means you can build more items/buildings faster.
193700788X|3.0|***Spoilers Follow***<br /><br />I stopped being deeply invested in this series 3 books previous when it was clear Mrs. Harris was turning Eric into a jerk to make room for Sam to be Sookie's HEA.  Therefore, I saw this ending coming years ago and have had time to mourn the loss of and get over the original Eric.  As the ending was not a surprise to me I was able to look at it objectively.  Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1) The book felt rushed.  After reading it, I felt I'd been invited to Sookie's Family & Friends reunion.  It works in the storyline but with so many people to write for there seemed to be slight shortchanging for a few characters.<br /><br />2) There should have been more heat simmering between Sam and Sookie from book 2, when Mrs. Harris said she knew who Sookie would end up with, forward.  While there were hints here and there along the way I don't feel like there was nearly enough of a romance between them for them to hop in the sack that quickly.<br /><br />3) The Claude being back thing felt so contrived. And Niall is so fae he didn't realize that Claude would be a danger to Sookie?  That felt far-fetched to me.<br /><br />That said, from an objective point of view it was fine.  This is not a book I will reread or think about again.  It didn't blow me away but I enjoyed the read. Not spectacular, not horrible, better than mediocre, worse than good. Fine is the best word for it.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I am really blown away by this record. Joe does take some chances here, unlike some reviews stating the contrary. Three Sheets to the Wind is one song for example where he does get out there a bit in a fun, progressive way. Overall, this is classic Satch, which is exactly what any real fan wants. The difference with this record is that Joe has made it fun again. His best records are always FUN over anything else. This record gives you that feeling. Tremendous energy here. The band sounds killer. Special kudos to Vinnie Colauita on drums on this record. He brings it! I feel that Joe really encapsulates his whole career here, which is no easy feat. These songs are pretty layered with nods to songs and albums of the past, which is a treasure for any Satch fan. I really liked the last record, Black Swans, but Unstoppable Momentum trumps it and gives the fans one of his very best. The title track, Can't Go Back, Three Sheets to the Wind, and Jumpin Out are probably my favorite, but there is no filler here. All the tracks have something interesting and fun going on with Joe's inimitable style shining through.<br /><br />I felt Joe went a little bland and mediocre on some of his records from the past decade, including Professor Satchafunkalis, Super Colossal, and Is There Love in Space? They all had some great tracks, but also contained too much filler. A more return to form with Black Swans and now this record. It is his best since Crystal Planet without a doubt. Highly Recommended!
193700788X|5.0|I loved the way that this whole story ended.  I don't think it could have ended any other way.  Sookie ended up with exactly who she should have ended up with and the story ended just the way it should have!  Great job Charlaine Harris!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Both our 4 and 7 year old kids like this app.  I think it's pretty fun too.  It teaches a bit of strategy yet is simple enough for a small child.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Not sure if it still exists on the market but it worked fine when I had it. i loved it. Kinda boring but i downloaded some accounting videos and watched later to do my home work.
193700788X|2.0|SI was so hurt and sorrowed by this book. I cried a lot during and after reading. I always thought Sookie and Eric would wind up together. But that's not what bothered me the most. It was the brutal way their relationship ended. As another reader pointed out they could have come to a heartfelt decision that they weren't meant to be. Instead it was short brutal and cruel. The Eric in this book is not the Eric we have come to know and love. CH created this character and made him larger than life. He is the most beloved character in the books. In each book Eric and Sookie's relationship  grew and they became more eamored of one another. Eric is a steadfast vampire whose word is his bond and much respected by other camps. But in this book he is made to be a total a** with ulterior motives. Why would CH create such a wonderful character and then totally assassinate him? He is in all the books and became more interesting than any of Sookie's other suitors. Even when she was with Quinn it was fleeting. She continuously thought of Eric. And later we found out it wasn't the blood bond she really loved him. Eric is Eric and that's why we love him. He didn't want to marry Freyda and go to Ok. As Sookie said he likes being a big fish in a small pond. But in this book it makes it seem as though he wanted it after all. I was totally saddened the way he is portrayed in this book. CH knows the fans love Eric and why shouldn't we? She created him to be lovable. I just don ' t know what she was thinking when she wrote this book.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry birds was one of the fisrt addicting games I have played. i have downloaded and beat all their apps so far. Bring on the next challenge!!
B009T8XBBO|4.0|For the folks who have issues with accidental deletion from the cloud storage:<br /><br />It is rather easy to accidentally touch remove from cloud, while in app device tab, so do not remove it from there, but remove it from your carousel screen.<br /><br />I uninstalled and reinstalled it fine to test for a bug like that, and had no issues.  I have also found if the screen isn't kept clean, even with stylus usage, there are times where the contacts are off a bit, so keep the screen clean frequently with the special cleaning cloth.<br /><br />I often buy an app or grab an app of the day for later play, and remove it after install(I have the smaller Fire HD 8.9, so space is at a premium, and having the cloud is an awesome feature).  I cycle through games frequently as well, so it is nice to not have to have a storage drive as close as the nearest wi-fi spot.<br /><br />Gameplay is interesting so far, I'll edit this as I get further.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!! A vision of a future where man is not the central protagonist but merely a pawn to a greater intelligence.
0061537969|5.0|This is a wonderful story from a dogs point of view.  You could not help but fall in love with this dog and get caught up in his life. The author, Garth Stein\\", makes it so easy for you to believe this is the way dogs really do think. It is so poignant and so smartly written. You will fall in love with this book the minute you pick it up. You will not be disappointed. Whether your a dog lover or not this book will keep you thinking about this story for awhile. I highly recommend this book!!!
B003UESJEW|5.0|I really love this movie.  The characters are all full and deep, the acting is superb, and with all of the downsizing in America these days much like the movie Up in the Air, this movie is very timely and apt.  That is what makes it a bit depressing for some - a colleague of mine in his 50's told me that's what the movie did for him, since he'd lost his previous job unexpectedly a few years back.  But yet the ultimate message is one of endurance.  Both of individuals and of the American Spirit.  The greatest lessons we can learn from ourselves and each other is when times are the worst and how we respond to them as individuals and as a community.  This movie captures that very well.<br /><br />Bottom-line: well worth seeing at least once, perhaps not worth purchasing (though I am happy I did since it's one I will watch from time-to-time because of the fine acting) but definitely worth a rental.
B004WJRDN2|5.0|the bonus tracks make this album worth owning. the original recordings are great. the sound is great and McCartney certainly finding his place after the Beatles.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I've bought a couple of these Nikon rear lens caps. One was for a Opteka lens that didn't come with anything and the other is just in case I lose one from any of my lenses. For the price, it's worth having an extra one around for the &#34;just in case&#34;.
B004WJREPO|5.0|the first time I heard this 20 years ago I did not really enjoy it - but now that I am more mature and have become a McCartney aficionado this album is like good wine and has aged well over time.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|As I bought more and more camera equipment I needed a bigger backpack to carry them. I bought the Lowepro 100 from Walmart for $60.00 and out grew it in a month. So I check backpacks out on Amazon and found the AmazonBasics backpack about $30.00 and I ordered it. It was a well built backpack, well padded with movable panels inside so you can custom fit what you have. I now have two of these backpacks that I carry nearly all of my DSLR equipment in. I've taken these backpacks across the country now and feel safe that my exspenive camera and lenses are well protected inside these packs. If I get to where I need more carrying capacity, I will definately buy another AmazonBasics backpack.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|I'm in love with this band! Daughter If You Leave is hauntingly beautiful. Really great music is best experianced with your eyes closed as it takes you on a journey lyrically. So, break off the repeat button and enjoy!

B00957T6X6|5.0|New twists and turns at every glance, a world so richly built only the characters can tear it asunder. Amazing.
B001RT89TC|2.0|I had super high hopes for this that were immediately dashed upon first listen. There are some songs that are so bad here that they don't even warrant a second listen. I am a huge metal-rock fan with a massive collection ranging from Priest, Maiden, Scorpions, Rush, Floyd, Zeppelin, ACDC, Dio, Rainbow, UFO, old Metallica, Sabbath and even the first Schenker album (I have not heard the second yet but I did order it). This falls way short of expectations set by the first one. Maybe it is the slower pace of the songs that I like the least. I will give it a few more listens but first impressions were not good. Schenker seems restrained on this one and not in a good way. Some of the vocals are like fingernails on a chalkboard. I am surprised by the super positive reviews.
B000002J09|5.0|My favorite song is &#34;when the levee breaks&#34; although I give the whole cd 5 stars.<br />It is interesting that LED recorded this song in 1971 way before Katrina but it<br />sounds brand new.
193700788X|1.0|[SPOILERS][SPOILERS][SPOILERS]<br /><br />The series can be summed up thusly: NOBODY WAS TEAM SAM, CHARLAINE, NOBODY.<br /><br />The best characters in the book were all vampires.  Sam was one of the most boring.  Good old steady Sam.  Great friend, great boss.  Boring lover.  I'm NGL, I read the first 9 chapters and then skipped to the end to see who she ended up with.  I'm so let  down that I probably won't finish it.  Afterall, what do I care about Arlene and the rest of the human world? Sookie has been embroiled with vampires for ages, I just don't get why she didn't embrace it.  =(
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Overall it was a good book :-)<br />I enjoyed reading it couldn't put my kindle down and even when out to watch the movie
193700788X|1.0|Glad it's over. CH clearly stopped caring long before I did. Returned the last book, had to read the finale, wish I stopped 3 books ago.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is the best kindle game I have played so far and the best part is it's free who doesn't like free stuff
B00BF11STU|1.0|It had nearly nothing to do with the actual event.  Basically this is Die Hard 12, or whatever crap they are up to now.  Reality is not present.  Go watch Argo if you want something actually based on things that happened.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book<br /><br />Every one should read it Greg is just like me funny book<br />Love it  I like the story
B000UNYK76|4.0|This is one of my favorite PJ Documentaries. It does give you a little glimpse into PJ (off the stage), but I did find myself wanting more one on one interviews. The set list is decent, not great (although I love the Lukin and Immortality scenes), wish they were longer. The best part of this documentary is how it looks, if the set list was better this would have been my favorite PJ doc.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|Very quiet, as expected of a Noctua product.  Cable well sleeved, and length is just right.  Removable corner rubber pads allow fan to be mounted on heatsink that does not have the most well-designed mounting system.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Bought this for use with a 10&#34; dutch oven.  More than enought capacity.  Lights coals quickly without fluid.  Has held up well, so far.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I am in love with this product! It is an amazing app, and works remarkably well. I highly recommend this app. #TeamKindle
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|This is a good one. I really like horror movies like these. I don't mind gory horror films every now and then, but I do<br />get bored with them sometimes. To be honest, I'll take creepy horror films over gory any day. And this film, like \\"Sinister\\",<br />and \\"Insidious\\" and the \\"Paranormal films\\" is creepy. Great film... really enjoyed it. :)
B009NY43NY|3.0|Well at least least the series is over. Not too happy with the ending but I am not the author.
B002CPMB9O|5.0|Denzel delivers a great performance as usual as the Harlem kingpin Frank Lucas then theres Russell Crowe got to love it the contrast of characters the way Ridley Scott captured the vibe of the 70's
B008XG1X18|5.0|Yes best app ever yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh AWESOME.<br />Great amazing I use this app all of the time. After I'm finished writing this I will go on PINTEREST because it is a cool app so yup.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|A great comedy, yeah there's nuidty, so what, I just found it to be a very good comedy/love story,well worth the money i paid for the full screen edition.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest but I am having trouble using the app I downloaded to my Fire.  It doesn't work quite the same as I am used to from my computer. I will need to play around a bit more.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I love thos book I read in less than 24 hours!! I would say the best one yet!! I hope Jeff Kinney writes more!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game. If you do not want to tilt it in order to mover iron man, you can just change it to touch. Also the things you use to speed up suit's upgrade get collected really easily. So if you like Iron Man, Iron Patriot, and like all of Tony Starks suit from MK1 to Iron Patriot MK 11 this is your game. :)
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I definitely give this game five stars. Very enjoyable and fun. I do say it is one of my favorite games to play.
1401937519|3.0|I enjoyed the book but was expecting a like new book as advertised. everything was going well until I reached some later chapters where the previous owner made numerous pen marks by underlining and circling certain words or paragraphs which makes it far from &#34;Like New&#34;.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|All-In-One Mahjong is my new favorite app.  I'm a Mahjong addict, and for months I've been searching for a good, solid Mahjong app for my Kindle.  I didn't want anything fancy, just the classic version similar to what I have on my PC and Linux workstation.  Well I'm happy to say that my search is over.  I have finally found the perfect Mahjong app for my Android. Thank you Pozirk Games.<br /><br />Things I love about the app:<br /><br />*  Everything works as it should.  No bugs or freezes.<br />*  It has a Shuffle option!  I know a lot of people say the shuffle is cheating, but I like to reshuffle the deck when I run out of moves.<br />*  It has 42 (yes 42) different layouts.  The traditional layouts are all there (turtle, crab, spider), but it has a lot of new and interesting ones.<br />*  It has a list of global \\"best\\" scores from all users of the app.  It is cool seeing the little flags representing players from around the world.<br /><br />And like any good user I have a wish list of things I would like changed in my favorite app:<br /><br />*  (resolved) Need an Undo Last Move option. «« (option added in June 2013 release)<br />*  (resolved) The \\"Pause\\" button does not pause the timer.  If I pause the app and shut down my Kindle, the timer keeps going. ««  (fixed June 2013 release)<br />*  (resolved) The \\"Back\\" arrow points to the right.  In all the software I use the Back function is shown as a left arrow, and the Forward function is shown by the right arrow.<br />*  The tiles are a little thick.  The extra thickness makes it look like more tiles are in the stack than are actually there. The super thick tiles sometimes obscures the tiles around them.<br />*  (resolved) In additional to the global best scores, I would also like a listing of my best scores (or the best scores achieved on my device).  «« (option added in June 2013 release)<br />*  (resolved) There is no way to get to the global list of top scores from the main menu.  A button to call up this list would be nice.  «« (option added in June 2013 release)<br />*  (resolved) You can cheat and get a great score if play the whole game using the hints.  Your time score should be adjusted every time you use the hints. «« (fixed June 2013 release)<br /><br />I know I have a long wish list, but if I never get any of them I will still be 100% satisfied with this app.<br /><br />************************************************************************************************<br />Edited:  July 12, 2013<br /><br />I've just been told that the latest version of the app has addressed a lot of the items on the \\"wish list\\".  WOW that was fast!  Love, Love, Love the new features added with the June 2013 release.  Love the new backgrounds and the ability to pick the style of the tiles.

B000KITQK2|5.0|I've only recently been introduced to the use of DIs and found this is exactly what I need for my Martin guitar. My guitar has been installed with an under the saddle pick up and does not have any controls, but I play only rhythm to accompany my singing. It suits my needs perfectly.
0547564651|5.0|This topic, like Timothy Noah's The Great Divergence and Charles Murray's Coming Apart, addresses some fundamental issues in our American society, including why the poor often continues to struggle.  Those of us who live comfortably in the middle-class (or above), may feel far removed from some of the struggles that the author Paul Tough (love that last name!) documents.  Whether close or near now, they are problems that ultimately will affect us all -- directly or indirectly.<br /><br />This book is not a how-to manual for parents of naughty children, so I understand why some readers were disappointed.  (I considered taking off a point for its somewhat misleading marketing and title, but decided not to, because I think the topic and Tough's ideas are so important.)  Instead, it is an important work on how to raise a successful generation of poor kids.  It shows how complex and intractable the problems of the poor can be, but it also points to meaningful steps that can be taken for success.  Tough takes a middle approach to his diagnosis, seeing it as a multidimensional challenge that is ultimately a matter of character-building.<br /><br />I teach at a suburban community college, so I do see a pretty wide range of students -- all ages, races, and socioeconomic circumstances. It gave me a greater appreciation for the challenges that some of us face.<br /><br />I recommend this book as a policy prescription -- not a self-help tome.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good Movie. I would have rated it a 5, but I can't hear at all well. With Direct Tv I have text for the hearing impaired. Please instruct me on setting this up.<br /><br />thanks, sbutah
193700788X|2.0|I have been reading about Sookie since long before True Blood. I can barely watch that show anymore it's so upsetting how they ruined all that Harris did with these books. They have some hot men otherwise it won't be worth the time anymore it's so weird. Anyway, I am a long-term invested reader in Sookie and her friends. I was so excited when Amazon messed up and send me the book a day early with a few other things I had ordered. You would have thought I won the lotto. I have been waiting for what seemed like forever for this book to come. I stayed up until well after midnight reading it even knowing I had to get up at 5am. I should have slept. I kept thinking there was going to be some great twist or turn at the end. There was a tiny one I am sure no one had seen coming, but it wasn't really even worth adding in. Otherwise, it was pretty pointless and even boring. I should have just read the last chapter and gone to bed, because that is all you really need to know coming away from this book.<br /><br />I am sure Harris loves and knows her story better than anyone else. I haven't always agreed with her twist and turns for certain people. But I have always respected the fact that these are her books to write. She had said that she had this ending in mind from book 2. And while I can respect that. I think it was a very poor way of getting there, almost like she gave up. Sookie would have been better off with no one. It wasn't the person it self, it was just the lack of passion behind it. It was just like umm okay you are the last one standing, so I umm guess it's you. So much pointless plots and things in this book that were not needed as well. Pam's ending I was okay with sort of at least Harris tried to do something, but thought Harris would do something more grand for Pam in the final book than what she did at the end. Some of Sookie's friends get a nicer/happier ending and you feel good about where it stops with them (new romances, babies, weddings...etc). Others you are like really!? This is your final book and you are doing that - why bother?! A few they talk about, but give you no ending at all for them. Yeah they are around/alive, but you don't get to know how their story ends.<br /><br />I have been team Eric for a long time. I loved how Harris took a \\"bad guy\\" and made him semi good when he was with Sookie. That love could beat out of the odds of evil in the end. I was not happy about Sookie's ending and I really was upset about Eric's ending. I would have been happier if they killed her or him off than the story Harris came up with.<br /><br />All the love stories a side, the story line in this book was just really off and sort of rush and random in spots. I still do not see the point of it at all in parts. It was poor filler at best. Was that truly worth being in the final book? I don't think so. Okay there is the bad guy, he is going to do a bunch of stuff and then oh they don't really care about him in the end? I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I can't tell you in detail what I am talking about. But you will see when you read it. It just felt very unfinished for the final book. I think no matter whose team you are on for who Sookie should end up with you will be disappointed in the story line and how she ends up with this person in the end. Just was lacking I felt.<br /><br />I won't buy the book unless you want the whole collection and need this one to finish it. I would just go into a book story and read the last chapter so you know how it ends and be done with it. Or just put your name on the list at your local library and read it when you are bored and have nothing else to read because you are a loyal fan. It is totally not worth paying full price to find out what happen. It's not that good. I hope Harris's follow up little book (After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse) clears up a lot more things when it comes out around Halloween.you are like really!?

1250012570|5.0|My favorite YA book of 2013 so far.<br /><br />Hands Down!<br /><br />I don't even like romance or love story themes.<br /><br />But, I loved this book. The characters, Eleanor and Park, made this book happen.<br /><br />I will not write about any part of this book so it is not spoiled. But I will share a few things that made this awesome.<br /><br />1. Set in 1986 which just was so great to see things without technology and such. Made me realize the power of mixtapes and really putting time into gifts and presents. This is lost these days.<br /><br />2. I loved how real Eleanor was. She never changes into something she is not. She was real all the way through.<br /><br />3. Park is a typical boy who goes through so many thoughts and ideas.<br /><br />The author did a fantastic job showcasing both angles without overdoing it and making for unnecessary reading. I laughed out loud, I cheered, I was angry, and I loved just how honest the whole book was from relationships, friends, bullying, and life.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell, in addition to having an awesome names, dropped some lines in this book that reminded of a John Green feel. I even tweeted John Green to tell him he should write a book with her. I think it would be AWESOMESAUCE!<br /><br />A few of my favorite lines that just stood out to me above the rest(no spoilers)<br /><br />\\"The only thing she didn't like to think about, about Park, was what he could possibly see in her.\\"<br /><br />\\"And you look like a protagonist.\\"<br /><br />\\"She didn't know there were things worse than selfish.\\"<br /><br />If you have not read this book and you read YA, then get this book NOW! Read it and then contact me to tell me your thoughts. I loved this book and think it will be up for many awards. I think this one will be tough to knock off my Favorite List. I just don't see it happening.<br /><br />A great novel by a great author who I cannot wait to read what she has in store next.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|I love this album. It does not have one bad song on it. It is such a wide variety of great rock 'n' roll. Each song is distinct and powerful. I bought the CD. It sounds great. Yes, it is a bit squashed. It is something of a contradiction to have great musicians, great songs, a great studio, a one-of-a-kind Neve console, and analog tape; and then, in mastering, squash the hell out of it. I guess that is just the times we live in. Fortunately, it sounds great in my car. Even though it sounds great on my home system, it is a bit fatiguing because it is so loud all the time. But that should not prevent you from buying this. All music is compressed these days so it will be loud. The songs are what make this CD great.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It took me a while to start this book, but once I did there was no stopping! Can't wait to get the next one and curl up on my couch and start reading!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book keeps you engaged even when you are convinced that you know what the end result will be. You assume you know what the ending is going to be like, and then everything starts to unravel. The ending was unexpected, yet very clever. No one would expect that ending. Life is not perfect. No one should expect a perfect ending in a book all the time. However, I was disappointed with the ending as well. Is there a sequel? I still want to know what happens next. So on that note, you will enjoy the book as much as I did. I read the book in less than a week.

B00756GRUE|5.0|Very solid construction, perfect finish, good for smaller wrists.  Never owned a watch with a chronograph before so did not know that the large second hand does not sweep unless chronograph is activated.  Strange but fine.  The chronograph bezels are continuously threaded and that makes locking and unlocking chronograph buttons a sinch; will not cross thread.  The large bezel turns smoothly.  No issues with water or battery charge.  Band is easy to adjust, will not stretch, and I like the safety latch.<br /><br />I would buy this watch again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|***Contains SPOILERS*****It was hard to avoid all the spoilers going around on the internet before the release of this book, so I knew whom Sookie did not end up with and was a little leery about reading the book, because let's face it, Eric is a pretty awesome character.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought the book was well written, had some nice twists, and wrapped things up neatly. I thought FDTW and DAG were the weakest of the books but was glad the writing strengthened with DITF, where we got to see a different side of Eric. I'm looking forward to the coda in the fall.  Anyone that has read CH's previous works know that her happily ever afters are realistic.  Realistic is exactly what the ending of this book is.  Sometimes the love that burns hot and fast, is passionate and wild and deep isn't the one that is going to last.  There were too many obstacles to Sookie's and Eric's relationship to make it last in a way that would suit the both of them.  Sookie was going to get old and never be turned, CH makes this quite clear throughout the novel.  Eric assumes he will be able to persuade Sookei otherwise.  People put Eric's character on a pedestal, but he is just as flawed as the rest of the bunch.  He keeps Sookie in the dark about many things (along with many others in her life), is high handed, and let's face it...sending Bubba for protection against the fairies was a terrible idea.  And their communication skills leave much to be desired. Her vision of a happy life is not fighting bloodbath after bloodbath with brief respites of peace with her beau.  That's what Eric's life seems to be. How many couples suffer from avoidance of their issues or ill communication? How many women/men ignore the flaws of their significant others before marriage and then think they'll magically change after \\"I do\\".  The same can be said of these star-crossed lovers.  So I think the book was a good reality check and kudos to CH for following her plan from the beginning (read the author's note in the book).  Though we don't get to see Sookie and Eric ride into the sunset together, they will live happily ever after, just not together.(read the author's note in the book).  Though we don't get to see Sookie and Eric ride into the sunset together, they will live happily ever after, just not together.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love the game. It's got the same concept of regular bingo except you're  traveling the world to different locations where your goal is to obtain various prizes by winning bingos. You're also hoping to collect all puzzle pieces for each location. This game can be linked with Facebook which is essential because you need friends who play the game to send you free gifts and you in return you do the same. It's a great game. The only problem is the connection gets lost often and your game data is lost. A fix would be great.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I'll admit there are some inconsistencies in this movie, like Iron man being able to take on Thor and other hard core baddies in &#34;The Avengers&#34; movie, but in this movie the armor is pretty fragile. However, I'm a big fan of Shane Black movies, especially &#34;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&#34; (One of my all time favorite movies). This movie definitely has Shane Black written all over it. Set at Christmas time, a good amount of gun play, funny banter between the characters. Also, the narraration by Robert Downey Jr. was similarly done in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I also love the twist on the Mandarin character and the way Ben Kinsley plays him. I can understand why hardcore Iron Man fans would be disappointed, because this is pretty much 70% Shane Black flick/ 30% Iron man movie.
0071390111|5.0|What I liked the most about this book was the improved writing style, in comparison to the previous edition. While this may not register with some readers, I found it to make the text much more manageable without sacrificing accuracy and scope. It truly is the book when a birds eye view on neuroscience is required.<br />It paints a wide portrait, constantly hinting at interesting details for the curious reader to follow up on.<br />Very nice indeed.
B000B8L6LI|3.0|The system appears to work well but only on knives that have a FLAT spine to which you can attach the clamp.  I have used it on two knives so far, an Opinel No.7 and a Victorinox Pioneer.  The opinel sharpens up really nicely - popping hair razor sharp.  The pioneer on the other hand, did better with freehand sharpening.  I think it was due to the spine shape, the pioneer would move a little in the clamp due to its tapered (base to tip) spine.<br /><br />I would go with a different system if I had the chance to repurchase.  For a QUICK sharpening of FLAT blades (Saber ground delica comes to mind) this would probably be great.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Very happy to report that Liquid Entertainment has removed the permission allowing the app to view running tasks and applications.<br />Many developers don't make changes like this despite customer complaints. So to reward Liquid I have decided to change my review accordingly, and I hope others will do the same. In order to influence more developers to listen to their customers, we need to continually punish bad choices (with boycotts and/or low ratings) and reward positive changes.<br />This is easily a 5 star game now that the permissions are reasonable.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best sifi book I have read in a long time. Its funny, its well thought out, it kept me on the edge of my seat the hole time...Andy Weir is a master at writing, I can't wait to read an other novel of is.<br /><br />Thanks mr. Weir

193700788X|5.0|I began reading the Sookie books WAAAYYYY before the TV show was even thought of so the ending was not remotely shocking to me. If you read any other Charlaine Harris books you would know she loves to throw a twist into everything and kill people. She loves to kill her characters :) I don't want to put any spoilers out b/c that's kinda rude but I think Ms. Harris did a nice job tying everything up with a bow and keeping the book from being as long as a Game of Thrones novel. Bravo and goodbye to Ms. Sookie. It's been a great ride!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really can not say anything that hasn't been said already. I just wanted to add another one star to bring down the two star rating. the book is a mess,a waste of money and time. first time ever I ask for a refund on a book.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is fun and relaxing but like most matching games not real original<br />It would be nice if they added a twist here and there
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend recommended the show to me and I AM HAPPY she did.  I love period pieces... And these characters are so well developed that EVERYONE will recognize their personalities/qualities in their own real-life family and friends... And after seeing Season 1, my addiction was in full swing--forcing me to download 2 & 3.. I'm patiently waiting for the new season... I'm a fiend for gossip!

B00AYQNOLW|5.0|What a stunning piece. I absolutely loved Baraka, and now Samsara. Fire up your projector, gather your friends and journey well.
193700788X|1.0|What a horrible last book. I am disappointed on so many levels I don't even know where to begin. I shouldn't be surprised, I have read her Lily Bard and Aurora Teagarden series and they lacked just as much.<br /><br />I have heard Amazon is issuing refunds. I strongly suggest since Ms. Harris \\"writes for herself\\" that people hit her where it hurts in the pocketbook!<br /><br />Review below talks about the book!!!<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Here are a few reasons I am so disappointed:<br /><br />1. Where was Eric in this book? Where was Pam? Where is Bill? They are some of the most loved characters. Without them in the book it just felt empty. We deserve to have closure on these characters and it just wasn't delivered.<br /><br />2. Anyone else care less about Mr. C, Barry, and Amelia. I could care less. They were brought in out of nowhere and poorly closed out.<br /><br />3. Would the character of Eric that she built up after the last 12 books just fold like he appeared to do in this book. Though I guess we don't know what really happened since Harris couldn't bother to show that part of the story.<br /><br />4. Sookie did nothing in this book. All her subcharacters held the plot. She was just a self reflective whiny side character.<br /><br />5. Sam, enough said. Really, really? No build up. Not believable at all.<br /><br />I am too worked up about this to truly write my feelings in an eloquent manner. One thing I know for sure, Ms. Harris will never get another dime from me. She may write for herself but we the readers fund her paycheck. Shame on you Harris for selling such subpar work.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I'll give no spoilers here. This conclusion to the WOT series was bitter sweet. Sanderson wrapped up the series well enough. Nobody could have done a perfect job in the time and space available. Due to the semi-meandering of the previous two volumes, some rather important questions were left unanswered and some &#34;wrap-ups&#34; were far more hurried than they should have been. Story lines deserving an entire chapter were wrapped up on a couple of sentences. Others were left entirely to the imagination. This was a bit disappointing. However, this is a must read for all of us who have followed the series since its inception oh so many years ago.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I love this movie.A kid at heart this is a great movie for the entire family.Fun,great charecters & wonderful computer animation.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Not sure what I expected in this one but it was so slow and meandering I couldn't finish it. In full disclosure this is not my standard genre but even so, as a voracious and avid reader I can usually manage to finish any book I start. Not so with this one. It started slow and ground slowly forward with uninteresting character non-development. It read like a grade school written soup ingredient label.

B001U9BRNE|5.0|Upon watching and hearing this concert I was sitting there just blown away!<br /><br />The talent assembled for this is non-stop! David Foster's writing and producing over the years has produced so much great music and a lot of it is shared on this concert! Hit after hit; singer after singer; surprises; and Katherine McFee! Her duet with Andrea Bocelli singing \\"The Prayer\\" should have you in tears. There are so many great things happening on this disc!<br /><br />The recording quality is superb!<br /><br />This Blu ray is truly one you don't want to miss if you are a fan of fantastic performances. You will LOVE this....guaranteed!
B005LAIGTG|4.0|I like the movie, but the story is kind of sad. I love the actor and actress in this movie.
B002CPD5LM|3.0|I LOVE Quincy and all that he has contributed to the music industry. This event, for sure, is fitting that he has been honored and celebrated.<br /><br />My main issue with this is that a few of the singers just don't cut it anymore. I realize that they all have been forces in prior years but, gee, when your voice says enough well.......<br /><br />I was very excited to get this when it was released and I do enjoy the redeeming quality of the band. The players are fantastic. The people who put the show together could have chosen singers who can really still sing!<br /><br />Should you desire to watch a show with singers and band that will blow you away, choose to purchase \\"Hit Man\\" celebrating David Foster. Amazing!
0374214913|5.0|I actually worked as a PM at Microsoft, so this hit pretty close to home. I don't read much fiction anymore, but I couldn't put this one down and ended up reading the whole book in a single day. Major thumbs up - I'd recommend it to anyone who has a slight \\"nerdy\\" side.
B005V1WZ10|4.0|I still enjoy Korn music after all these years.  Mixing the dubstep in with the Korn sound doesn't really seem to change their style that much.  On a bad note the seller sent me the wrong version since it didn't come with a dvd.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I purchased this for my son. It requires quite an effort to get anywhere. Especially if you play without purchasing using real cash. They have little treasure chests that pop up every so often, asking if you want to open for a certain amount of sand dollars or pearls..sometimes can open for free.....beware open the free ones....otherwise, it's like getting robbed from pirates....example...would you like to open for 5 pearls...you receive 1 pearl.. and let me tell you they are very hard to come by without buying them.... cute game, but way too much work to make it worth playing.......

B007SGM084|2.0|Or why reading these books may give you horrible Twilight flashbacks...<br /><br />A quick synopsis... Anastasia Steele is a bookish 22 year old graduating college and trying to find a job in the publishing world.  Christian Gray is a 28 year self-made business tycoon.  Fifty Shades of Gray was originally written as Twilight fan-fic, but then recast with original characters.<br /><br />First, let me begin by saying I read a lot... an almost psychotic amount.  Given a choice, I'll read 3 books a day when I'm busy with life and 6-8 books a day when I'm bored.  Therefore, it's no surprise that when the hulabaloo around Fifty started, I was bound to read the entire trilogy, because I needed something to do one morning.  It surprised me when I read them, read them again, and again.  I read them repeatedly for 4 days.  I learned a lot and I was disappointed a lot.  We'll start with the good things...<br /><br />The books are funny.  Author E.L. James has a quirky writing style that's entertaining.  It's a very relaxed style and James does an outstanding job writing an easily-read book, a book with comfortable prose that is neither banal or mediocre.  Although she occasionally uses words that the average non-reader may need to look up in a dictionary, the context is descriptive.  Using a $50 word in $10 prose isn't easy to do without sounding pompous or condescending, but James does it elegantly almost every time.<br /><br />The trilogy is a credible story arc.  James provides a snapshot of time in the characters' lives, but seamlessly weaves details of their pasts so you end with a true understanding of why these people are as they are.<br /><br />Inevitability isn't a given, although sometimes you can plainly see the next step. While the reader can see a pattern about mid-way of Book 2, there are still twists so the obvious path isn't always the one taken.  That fact alone makes this trilogy worth reading.<br /><br />It continues to be interesting even to the last word of the last book.  Each little cliff hanger leaves you wanting just enough to continue reading.  Since the set is a trilogy, I recommend reading the first 5 chapters.  If you like where it's going, just buy the other 2 books.  When you get to the end of Book 1, you won't want to pause long enough to download it from Amazon, much less drive to a book store.<br /><br />The books might help your sex life.  Whether that's with a partner or alone, they will definitely add a few shades of interesting.  The sex writing is well done.  I'll let you explore why it's well done.<br /><br />Now, the bad...<br /><br />The characters are typical.  She's bookish, he's charming.  She's middle-class, he's rich.  She's younger and virginal, he's older and worldly.  Sadly, the banality of her characters overrides her wonderful, quirky writing.  Each time Anastasia has a \\"wow golly gee\\" moment, I rolled my eyes.  Each time Christian has a \\"trust me baby\\" moment, I wanted to roll his eyes like dice.  Much of the character exposition could have been dubbed by any of the adults in Charlie Brown movies.<br /><br />This book could have been called Fifty Shades of Fake Sex and been accurate.  The sex depicted is a fantasy and not always in the good way. Before the first sex scene, I knew this was written by a woman.  By the time the BDSM sex started, I also knew this was written by someone who's not part of the BDSM lifestyle.  She should have done her homework.  The sex read like a horny teenage girl and that's only interesting to other horny teenage girls.  It will pull you in, just don't expect reality to look anything like this.  It's porn for women.<br /><br />There's too much sex; she substitutes quantity for quality.  I don't care that they're in love and they're 20-somethings in good health with loads of energy.  It's not real and it's not even close sometimes.  She doesn't try to make the sex timing feel real and that ruins large sections of the book.  Again, it's writing for a hornyteenage girl.  The well-written sex descriptions are killed by the unrealistic timing and bad research.<br /><br />Christian's back story paints his BDSM lifestyle as the result of child abuse.  For those that understand the BDSM lifestyle, that's simply not true.  BDSM isn't the result of anything other than a natural curiosity about the psychology of sex and adult sexual interaction.  James had the opportunity to build a bridge of understanding between the Average and BDSM worlds.  She failed spectacularly.<br /><br />The ending is predictable.  James worked so hard in the beginning to take the story down unexpected paths and then she gives it a storybook ending.  While I saw it coming, I kept hoping I was wrong.  The storybook ending adds to the bad fantasy aspect of the trilogy.  There were so many other endings, some happy and some not, that James could have chosen.  Her elegant writing remains elegant to the end, but her genius is greatly diminished by the trite ending.<br /><br />The psychological basis for Dominance/submission play is too one-sided from the female perspective.  Christian's psychological exposition needs a lot of work.  Again, the female writer didn't do enough research on the male psyche, especially one as damaged as Christian's.  I found myself appreciative of his willingness to improve himself, but the time frame of the story made his change unbelievable.  Anastasia's psychological exposition was better.  The very short time frame was on the edge of suspect, but still plausible.<br /><br />I hate to end on a bad note, so...<br /><br />Despite Anastasia's \\"golly gee\\" and Christian's \\"trust me, baby,\\" the character interaction is well done.  Kudos for an interesting set of books.  Learn from your mistakes and keep writing.  Despite my unhappiness with these books, I sincerely look forward to the next one.

193700788X|1.0|I read this book cover to cover in the last 16 hours. And that's only because I had to take time off to sleep after a business trip, work some more, eat, cook, and tend to my family. So let's assume I read the whole thing in about 5 hours. It was some of the most poorly invested 5 hours of my life.<br /><br />If it were possible I would have given this book 0 stars. I am not kidding when I say I have NEVER written a review on amazon.com for a book before but I was so disappointed in this book I felt I had to put something in writing.<br /><br />I have spent years and countless dollars reading these books, often excited and desperate for the next novel to come out to see what would happen with Eric and Sookie. And now to have her wind up with Sam is just unbearable. Someone else in a review had said that it would be one thing if Sam had been painted throughout the series as a viable alternative, but he never has been; I am in complete agreement. He always chose the worst women - and my experience is that people don't make radical changes like start choosing the right guy or gal. But all of a sudden (being brought from the dead or no) now he realizes Sookie is the only one for him? And using that experience as the catalyst seems pretty cheap. And on top of that, I have no idea how Sam could be the only one for Sookie - it'd be like me suddenly marrying my childhood guy friend... more like kissing your brother.<br /><br />Eric was frequently portrayed as having many admirable qualities along with his self-serving ones. The way this ended just made Eric out to be much less than the great character many of us have come to love - more a shell or caricature of the great Eric we've seen through the years. It was a cheap out and a cheap ending to the series and the character. And it is out of character to believe that Eric would simply take the whole Freyda thing  lying down. Just not at all to type. And showing none of the love stored up over their amazing courtship.<br /><br />But I guess if Sam could have some radical re-imagining, the author thought Eric deserved the same, but to the detriment of the series and the storyline.<br /><br />I feel not only disappointed but gypped. I am sorry now I wasted so much time and energy on this series. I used to recommend to my friends and family to read it, but I will never do so again.<br /><br />I had a rotten feeling where this was going when I opened the book and read CH's more or less apology that the story will not meet some people's expectations. I knew she chose the Sookie-Sam route as soon as I read that. I am so sorry that the sinking feeling reading her pre-book apology I got, not only dashed the excitement I had when I ripped open the box to get at the book, but also turned out to be justified.<br /><br />**ADDITION** I just learned that there is an \\"After\\" novel coming out this fall as a post script so we find out what happens to the good citizens of Bon Temps along with what reads like simple filler. I have to say I have no plans to buy that book or even read it. CH has lost me as a fan forever, and I certainly don't want to read or re-read anything of this series again nor read anything else she might write. I wish I could get my $15+ back on this book and have no intention of spending another dollar on a Sookie book of any kind.br />But I guess if Sam could have some radical re-imagining, the author thought Eric deserved the same, but to the detriment of the series and the storyline.<br /><br />I feel not only disappointed but gypped.

0307730697|5.0|I've read several books on Special Forces and this was definitely different. It starts when Adam Brown was very young, covers the ups and downs in his life, and gets to a point where you wonder, &#34;How could this guy ever get into the Navy, much less become a SEAL?&#34;  That's the point when the story gets very interesting.<br /><br />Adam Brown was driven, was fighting a few personal demons, and was guided by love and faith.  Again, not a typical SEAL / SOF book.  You get a very detailed look at his life, his passion to be the best and make a difference, and what he did to find balance between his work and personal life. It is a unique insight into what these guys need to do just to reach that level of excellence.<br /><br />The final chapters were tough to read. They were amazing, but you could feel the pain of those who cared about Adam - family and team members. This book was masterfully written, and the story is unlike any other that I've read and is definitely recommended.
098555780X|4.0|The author has very interesting ideas in this book. I guess I was kind of expecting more traditional knots like turks heads and square stitches and so forth but of course that is my fault. That said, what is in the book is original and fun and I will acquire volume 2 when it comes out.

193700788X|1.0|I got hooked on the early books, and by about 7 or 8 the quality of the story really went downhill. Bought and read the last book because I could not bear to not finish the series, and honestly, I feel cheated and robbed. While I've always been a fan of the Sookie/Sam story, I feel like it was so contrived and rushed and all the events in the last book were poorly put together. Between this book and the last one, I am wholeheartedly disappointed.

B00BPWDMP2|3.0|Country trio Lady Antebellum have sculpted a fine career for themselves over the year.  After multiple Grammys and continued commercial success, the trio haven't attempted to shake up their sound because, honestly, why should they? \\"If Ain't Broke, don't fix it\\" right?  Because of this philosophy, [[ASIN:B00BPWDMP2 Golden]] is merely a good album, but not an exciting or innovative one.  This is an album that should be 'just what the doctor ordered' to Lady A fans, but to more casual listeners, may not strike an earth-shattering chord. The standard cues are always in place: beautiful vocal blend between Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott and alternation of the lead, songwriting/guitar contributions from Dave Haywood, and somewhat conservative, thoughtful production work.<br /><br />\\"Get To Me\\" opens solidly, but it isn't exceptionally engaging.  It does the 'expected', but just leaves the desire to take things up a notch.  \\"Goodbye Town\\" falls into a similar boat, this time with Charles Kelly handling lead duties.  The biggest detraction with \\"Goodbye Town\\" is that it feels as if it will never end.  At the end, Kelley is given too much free time to ad lib unnecessarily.  Things look up with the proceeding trio of \\"The First Time\\", \\"Downtown\\" and \\"Better Off Now (That You're Gone)\\", which are stronger.  Sure, the formula remains much the same, but all three cuts seem to have more polish than either \\"Get To Me\\" or \\"Goodbye Town\\" did.<br /><br />\\"It Ain't Pretty\\" is pretty good, summed up by lyric \\"It ain't pretty when a heart breaks\\", but still it doesn't ruffle many feathers.  \\"Can't Stand The Rain\\" remains conservative in sound, though grows in intensity on the chorus.  \\"With arms open wide / I'll be your umbrella when you just can't stand the rain...\\", Kelly/Scott sing on the chorus.  It's a path already tread and somewhat schmaltzy, but its pleasant enough and the band seems sincere.  \\"Golden\\" proves to be a lovely title track, only to be followed up by a less memorable \\"Long Teenage Goodbye\\".  The problem with \\"Long Teenage Goodbye\\" is that there is not enough 'attitude' from Scott; perhaps slightly more exciting and assertive vocals could've made the track a more memorable one.  \\"All For Love\\" like many cuts is good, not breathtaking while penultimate cut \\"Better Man\\" atones somewhat, even if the theme seems recycled many times over.  Closer \\"Generation Away\\" has many things going for it, including is rhythmic nature and the use of organ, But things get a bit corny with an unnecessary lift of spiritual \\"He's Got The Whole World in His Hands\\"; it just misses the mark a bit.<br /><br />Ultimately, [[ASIN:B00BPWDMP2 Golden]] is an album that die-hard Lady Antebellum fans will find as enjoyable as the trios others albums. To those less devoted or invested in the trio, Golden is more average. I f[[ASIN:B002WIDRM6 Need You Now]] is considered the trio's last 'home run'  [[ASIN:B0050CJNJ2 Own The Night]] was good, but not as strong as it. Golden falls inline with Own The Night, but may is arguably even less memorable. There's nothing wrong with averageness, but Lady Antebellum may want to invest in more engaging and exciting material in the future.  3 stars.ble \\"Long Teenage Goodbye\\".

B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I really wasn't expecting much from this one after he sang all of those American Songbook covers. I gave up on him years ago, which was tough for me considering that Every Picture Tells A Story was the very first album that I ever bought to start my huge collection of music way back in the summer of 1971. So I had to listen to sound clips and read the first reviews here while holding out a ray of hope. Yes, I had to run out and buy it just like a teenager on the day of release for their favorite artist! I have always considered him as an interpreter of other legendary songwriters and able to make other songs his own. Well, this set of 11 original heart felt lyrics and 1 cover will probably rank near the top of all his releases. However, since it is too early to give it a legendary five-star rating, I give this one a generous 4 stars. Awesome music! Keep up the good work, Rod. I am so glad that you are happy these days and hopefully we will get to see you on tour soon!
0812982622|4.0|Set in today's North Korea of totalitarian 'doublethink', Orphan is an absorbing, fast-paced, intricately plotted, picaresque novel.  In it, Johnson explores personal self-identity's crucial need for a supporting context of family and friends.  (Freud would say the ego has to be located in the superego.)  But the North Korean government claims that the state replaces family and friends; Dear Leader is all that anyone needs, the complete superego.  In its themes, Orphan is in many ways similar to Orwell's \\"1984,\\" but its reality in a real country much in the news today is riveting, adding a frisson of horror which is both terrifying and titillating.  The novel is extremely clever--  it's on the plausible edge of  'magical realism'.<br /><br />In Orphan's haunting peek-a-boo of shifting identities, the men are fleshed out much more realistically than the women.  Essentially all the female characters are presented through the eyes of the male characters.  Johnson tops up the hero's hunger for family and friends with a driving love interest, an actual breathing woman.  It's almost as if Johnson is preparing the screenplay: Ivanhoe, with the damsel's pennon next his heart, battles the Black Knight for her favors.  Johnson is, at the same time, continually mocking the medieval romance that he's peddling here.  After all, books have to sell if writers are going to survive.  Orwell did much the same with Julia in \\"1984:\\" she was \\"a rebel from the waist downwards.\\"  However, the love story is a rather late development, providing a tidy closure to the complex and sprawling story.  The brutal police-state action through much of the earlier narrative seems likely to sustain more male readers than female ones through to the concluding chapters.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this....once I got past the first couple pages I couldn't put it down. I know I am behind the times on reading this, but I always seem to do that. (I only read Harry Potter during the fall for the first time.) I don't usually like books told from one character's point of view, but I can't think of any other way that this story could have been told. It would have been a completely different story from Peeta's point of view, or an outsider's point of view. The author gives JUST enough description so that you can imagine everything, but not so much that your imagination is unnecessary. I read this book in just two days and am now eagerly looking forward to devouring the second one.

It helps them make the experience better.<br /><br />This game gets really great when you start leveling up your char. It starts to become a 'Zen' like experience, quickly timing jumps and getting to the end of the run. Highly suggest this game. Played it more than 95% of my other tablet games. And no, I don't know or work for any of the devs. This is just a great experience. Easy to learn, hard to master.

B00CL0J99K|3.0|SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />For me this was the weakest of not only the Iron Man movies, but of all the recent Marvel tie-in movies.  Also, let me say up front that I do not care about accuracy to the comic books, but I do care about consistency between the movies.<br /><br />I'll start with the good:<br />- The acting all around was good.<br /><br />- The CGI was excellent.<br /><br />- I liked the twist with the Mandarin and the possibilities with the media distorting reality.<br /><br />- All of the references to the Avengers movie and the references to Iron-Man 1.<br /><br />- The realism of Tony dealing with PTS and working through his mental struggles.<br /><br />- The skydiving scene was very cool.<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Tony having the chest piece completely removed at the end of the movie.  Whether or not you like Iron Man 2 or not, the fact is that it happened and much of the story in the movie revolved around Tony dying from Palladium poisoning, trying to find and alternative power source, all of Tony's reckless activities due to the idea of dying, discovering a new element to replace Palladium, etc.  If he could just have a surgery and have the chest piece removed then most of that movie goes away.  And, I had someone say that he was able to do it now because of the Extremis program.  If that were true then that does not work either because he would not need a surgery at all if that were the case.  Did all the Extremis people who got repeatedly shot need surgery to remove the bullets...no.  So he shouldn't need a surgery either to remove shrapnel if Extremis was the answer, which the movie gives you no reason to think that was the case anyways.<br /><br />- Prior to this movie it was always made clear that the chest piece in Tony was powering his suit.  They have completely ignored that fact in this movie.  As a result for a lot of the movie his suit never reaches full charge and therefore is constantly in a weakened state, so he went backwards on hisdesign.  I understand that the new suit did need to have a certain level of internal power to allow it to fly to him and to allow it to suit him up, but beyond that is should have been powered by his chest piece as was established previously.  I'm sure they did this to set up the ending for the removal of the chest piece, but come on.  Again, another consistency issue.<br /><br />- As others have mentioned there is just not enough Iron Man.<br /><br />- All the controlling of the suit remotely.  So, there was already a lack of Iron Man in the movie, but on top of it most of the times when we did see Iron Man it was just the suit with Tony controlling remotely.  This is ridiculous.  A lot of the appeal of Iron Man is having the guy inside the suit.  I really hope this does not become a trend for Iron Man going forward.<br /><br />- The craziness with Tony giving out his address on TV.  Really?  Because anyone and everyone who wanted to get his address couldn't find it out on their own without being told, especially terrorists who had the technology to block out the television airways and had the means to get into the President's cell phone.<br /><br />- Tony publically announces that he is coming after the Mandarin to kill him after Happy is put in the hospital.  Don't you think he would have gone home and made his suit battle ready as quickly as possible or change to a suit that was battle ready?<br /><br />- When they are being attacked by the helicopters at his house he had the suits that he could have called as he did at the end, but didn't...why?  Oh yeah, because it would take away from the climax of the movie.<br /><br />- The little kid brought nothing to the movie and was totally unnecessary.<br /><br />- The Extremis group was taken too far with giving them super strength, breathing fire from their mouths, etc.<br /><br />- The Extremis research took years upon years to get sort of working, but still not perfect.  Then Tony comes along when Pepper is the only one left and in the blink of an eye he can just fix her like it was nothing, effectively wiping out a major part of the movie like it never happened.<br /><br />- The climax with all the Iron Man suits seemed good at first, but it was taken too far over the top.<br /><br />In any case, this is my opinion on the movie.  I just expected more from Iron Man 3.

193700788X|1.0|I wish we were able to rate this book 0 stars because that is what it deserves.  I am so disappointed with Charlaine Harris, she ended one of the best series to date with the worst possible outcome.  I don't feel that it was in anyway true to the character and I am so upset that she desecrated the relationship between Sookie and Eric - knowing the majority of her fan base had a special love for the two characters.  I can understand why they may not be able to be together,but I fail to see the need to literally destroy any hope of reconciliation - why could they not end it amicable understanding the paths they wish to travel down are different.  I feel very, very ripped off and I wish I could get my money back - what a terrible disappointment.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Was never a big fan of zombies, but this show reeled me in from the start. Can't wait for season three.
1439127727|5.0|I have  no idea what possessed me to read this book since I rarely read nonfiction and have minimal interest in politics. I'm so glad I read this. From the first page, this look at the relationships among ex-presidents and the current president from Truman on up was fascinating. I had no idea how much Eisenhower had influenced the actions of presidents that came after him, nor how deep Nixon's tentacles entwined into even the Clinton presidency. This is a fun read with lots of detail about the egos, maneuvering and behind-the-scenes actions involved in the presidency.<br /><br />Since I don't know tons about politics, I'm not sure if all of this information will be as new to others as it was to me--but it seems that much of it did not come out until the presidents involved passed away.<br /><br />What was most memorable is how the bond created by being president reaches across party lines so that some of the closest bonds are formed between former \\"enemies\\" (George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton being the prime example). I was left with a sense of admiration for all presidents and for the office, awe for the intellect required of all presidents, and feeling heartened that there are people who really do have the nation's best interests at heart.<br /><br />This book also shook many of my previously held beliefs about certain presidents. For example, as a staunch Democrat, I assumed George W. Bush retreated to private life so rapidly because he was hiding in shame, but based on this book, it's really because he didn't want to get in Obama's way. (I'm also wondering, however, if the authors are Republicans, because throughout the book, Republican presidents came off much better than the Democrats.)

0439023513|4.0|I love, love, love The Hunger Game Trilogy. I couldn't put down the first two books once I opened them, but throughout the last book, I found myself lost a few times. At some points the book seemed to drag on and on, and take turns that didn't seem to fit in. In the end of the book, I felt like it was very rushed and the two main characters were just thrown back together to give it a decent ending...It definitely wasn't my favorite book of the 3, but was still fairly decent.

B005LAJ17M|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad show, but it just doesn't scream Emmy & Golden Globe winner in my eyes. It feels overacted & a little far fetched in the same ilk as 24. And the wife is just as annoying and oblivious to anything as the wife in 24!! To its credit it does finish well but I was honestly left disappointed after such hype but more so for Damian Lewis who I loved in Band of Brothers as &#34;Winters&#34; and in this seems awkward & too rigid. Will not be buying the 2nd season

193700788X|1.0|I loved this series of books. The many characters and their fascinating existences have been a joy to read. But as the series began to reach its end, the stories became too complicated and the story line began to unravel. The final book of this series is a horrible end to Sookie's story. I warned of spoilers, so stop reading now if you want to find out the end for yourself... but this ending is the worst imaginable and written with horrible haste. Once learning that Sam has feelings for Sookie, and she for him, the book almost feels incestuous. They had a wonderful friendship that superseded (supe the intended term here) all others. Since Sookie was part fae, everyone would have some attraction to her, including Sam. But why would she end up with him? She had made so many sacrifices for so many other people that the act of using the c. dor to save his life could have easily been for friendship and not love forever. The love scene between them was written so poorly it is repellent. I wish Charlaine the best of her success for the future but I will avoid her books in the future. She did her fans a huge disservice and her characters an injustice with this last book.
193700788X|4.0|I seem to be one of the only reviewers here that enjoyed the book.  I have been a loyal reader of the Southern Vampire Mysteries since book one and they have all been on my auto-buy list.  Yes, there did seem to be some rushed plotlines, and several facts (Sookie's telepathy with regards to reading shifters), were ignored, but on the whole, I loved this book.  I ordered it on Kindle this morning and just finished it twenty minutes ago.  I logged onto Amazon to see how others found it and was amazed by the reviews.<br />As I thought at the end of Deadlocked, Sookie did indeed end up with Sam, but wasn't that a given through the whole series?  I kept waiting for Sookie to give up on vampires (yes, even Eric!) and see what was right in front of her.<br />As for Claude being the last bad guy, I did find that a little contrived, but I was willing to suspend some disbelief given that Charlaine's writing was as compelling as usual.<br />As for everyone's anger, you can't please everyone with the ending of a beloved series and she has said more than once that she knew how it was going to end all along.  I am still a fan, and will reread this series with great pleasure!

B009T8XBBO|3.0|Slow load on my kindle fire. Very good graphics and smooth play. Very small text and no way to change size. Very hard to read on original fire 7&quot; screen. Seems that play is just tap screen at green circles. The characters run around and things happen. If I could see better it may be a good game. Do not know if I will keep it.
B0084BMUFA|2.0|Having never read the book, I am now 80 and it still inspires me to do good while you still have time on this earth.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I sometimes find myself playing for hours at at time I highly suggest getting this app it is way better than temple run and it is my favorite appp
193700788X|4.0|Just finished reading the last Sookie Stackhouse book. The ending is what I expected and was fitting for Sookie. I know some readers are upset by the way the series was going and especially with this last book.I have no problems with how the series ended. I enjoyed the ride and will miss all the characters. At least there is still the tv series ;)
B00811U0FK|5.0|the figure is great and the details are awesome. Looks amazing on my shelf... I love the Battle Version figures they are amazing just buy it
B0078Q2HAA|1.0|Can't add much more to the other one star reviews. Half the movie was about the most undignified part of her life! SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A REAL MOVIE ABOUT MARGARET THATCHER!!
B00BHXUC4S|4.0|A worth re-master of a great album, and what gets it better stars is a complete version of Borderline, not the one found online.<br />Clear sound, this will replace my original version on my IPod (LOL)!
B007PVHAN2|3.0|I absolutely am a huge Bob Marley fan so I loved this documentary. Although there are many other documentaries on Bob this one had quite a few new things about him that hasn't been repeated over and over. they had great footage of his hometown. I give it a 3 stars because the blu ray doesn't play well. It skips a lot.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Even if there is some question about all the accuracy, the portrait is so excellent of both Abe and Mary.  I even could forget about the actor and actress and focus on appreciating the heavy burden the Lincolns carried.  Well worth the time to view and then read about more about all the major players of that period.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|this game is a cool game for kids and adults. my whole family loves it. the best gift from grandma!
030758836X|5.0|I can't believe how long I had this book sitting in my \\"to be read\\" pile.  If I had known how good it is, I'd have started reading it the day I brought it home.  It's a story about a woman's disappearance under suspicious circumstances and that is one layer of the story.  But it is also a story about two people and a marriage and that is a whole other layer.  Just when you think you know what makes them tick, the author throws another curveball and you have to re-think your assumptions. The pace and details of the book are really well done.<br /><br />I love mysteries and thrillers and this book, though different from most of the standard mysteries or thrillers I read, kept me riveted. The book is written from two different first person perspectives -- Nick and Amy. Nick's part starts in the present and Amy's part starts in the past.<br /><br />It's hard to explain why you like a book when nearly everything you can think of to say what you liked about it would spoil the suspense for people who haven't read it yet.  So I'll just give two pieces of advice -- or cautions.<br /><br />1st caution:  Do not skip ahead even one chapter while reading.  I mean it.  Even if you think you know what's going on and just want to check it out.  Every time there was a new twist or turn (and there are a lot of them!), I'd want to skip ahead.  But I resisted the urge and am very glad I did because it would have ruined everything.<br /><br />2nd caution:  Don't start this book with expectations.  It is a psychological thriller.  Most of the reviews from people who hated this book are because it didn't meet their expectations, especially their expectations for an ending that would make them happy.  But the ending will make you think and a book that makes you think is a very good thing.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, you should.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have used this product several times, but what i like most about it is the compact nature and the ability to carry it with you.  The carbine and ceramic sharpeners are very easy to use.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Wonderful chance to see many different productions, beautiful music. Enjoyed the movie disk and would watch it again.  Bought one as a gift also!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Easy read...  Good story with some twists and turns.  I was not disappointed at all...  It was recommended to me by a friend and I have since recommended to others.
B009A9SULS|5.0|Bought it on a whim, and really like it.  Only drawback is no back lighting, but I understand this is not unusual.  Very light and wasy to carry.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|An excellent read. Gripping story with intrigue, more intrigue, double-crossing and politicking. Its long! But well worth the time to read it. One piece of advice, keep a note-book handy to keep track of the myriads of characters. Much better than the TV series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book.  Well written.  Hard to put down.  It was a bit heavy for anyone who is a parent because all the characters were so normal, but again, they were not.  Heavy emotions.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Great read. You never really are sure who the real bad guy is. I changed my mind numerous times. Quite a lot of twists.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Picked this up while waiting on my flight couldn't put it down. It made me laugh cry and think. You just never know how someone else envisions their own life.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Bought it only to keep it as a collectible.  My son has one that he built, it looks good.  We're both happy.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|This was a rental but in hindsight I should have purchased the DVD.  But I got just what I ordered so I can't complain.
193700788X|1.0|For the last year I've read everything I could lay my hands on by Charlaine Harris and I bought DEA the day it came out.  Duh.  Guess CH is laughing all the way to the bank, having treated her readers with disdain, releasing an undercooked mash-up.  Some of my favourite characters appear in the book but they're flat and charmless.  My real beef with the ending is that it doesn't really end, just trails away. The Sookieverse has been reduced to paint-by-numbers.  It's a smash and grab rather than a grand heist.  There's no thrill or mystery to it, except the mystery of why the vivid characters of previously novels are now cheap copies of their former selves.  A little more humour wouldn't have gone astray either.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I didn't like it at first but now I cant get enough of it. I loved the  first one so much I got the other one I cant wait to get the brave one next.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Brad Pitt. This is my personal opinion only.<br />There is a lot of violence but the movie was very good.
B00000J227|2.0|I have to agree with  Flyerfan's review, my biggest dissapointment with this album was that the guitar solo on \\"I was only joking\\" is gone; I've seen these type of edits on several greatest hits albums, the purpose, I guess is to put as many types tracks as possible on a CD and justify a $20.00 price.<br /><br />This could have easily been solved by eliminating \\"What Am I Gonna Do (I'm So In Love With You)\\" (when was that song ever a hit?) from the album.<br /><br />Several Rod Stewart's compilations have been released in recent years, so do your homework and get one that has the complete versions of these amazing songs.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|*No Spoilers Here<br /><br />This book is what happens when a great writer takes a literary look at SF/F.  Gaiman takes an objective, non-biased look at America as a foreigner in a foreign land, and in my opinion nails it (as much as I hate to admit it).<br /><br />He used the SF/F as a medium, but make no mistake this story is literary all the way.  And the plotting is so great that it keeps the reader engaged throughout the lengthy book.<br /><br />Great writing.  _American Gods_ is in my top ten all time favorites.
B005K17RU0|3.0|For the most part this app is great. I recently took a motorcycle trip from West Palm Beach, FL to Belleville, IL, camping along the way &amp; this app was invaluable. It gave me my weather updates from my &quot;current location&quot; all along the way with no problems. It was also extremely easy to get reports for my evening's destination every morning, so I always knew what I'd be driving into. The videos came in surprisingly helpful to look at the larger overviews to see if I'd be hitting any bad weather between the days point &quot;a&quot; &amp; &quot;b&quot;. All VERY helpful.<br /><br />My problem is with the &quot;Maps&quot; section. The page shows my current area map w/ doplar overlays at the top, with 4 smaller maps shown just beneath of other places that you have added. This all looks great, but when I attempt to enlarge any of them by touching it the screen just goes blank white, with the exception of the ads at the bottom &amp; the maps name on top .... those load fine. But for some reason the map itself won't load. This means I can't customize with different overlays, etc.<br /><br />I contacted customer support &amp; they told me to do what I had already done: uninstall &amp; then reinstall the app. Then they asked me if my &quot;Google Maps&quot; app works on my tablet, which it does. I was then told via email that a more experienced tech would be contacting me soon to get more info &amp; get to the bottom of the problem. I did receive an email fairly quickly asking me to respond &amp; explain the problem in detail (again). I did so about a month ago but never heard from anyone again.<br /><br />For the most part this is a great app, &amp; on the maps section I do get the thumbnail of the area that shows the radar overlay. But on the bike trip I needed the ability to open the maps up &amp; it was kind of a pain.<br /><br />I take off 1 point for the glitch &amp; 1 for customer service dropping the ball.<br /><br />One more thing, the widgets work nicely on my tablet - showing the current temp, the days temp spread, weather description, etc. Very nice!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Although I read some bad reviews for this 5th book , I had looked forward to reading it and wasn't put off by said reviews . I am so happy that I ignored them.  A Dance with Dragons didn't disappoint . Now I can't wait for the 6th book . Another book you won't want to put down . So many twists and turns , Mr. Martin keeps you on the edge constantly .
193700788X|1.0|I don't believe I can say anything more than the other reviewers have said, but I just couldn't resist rating the book.  I want Ms. Harris to see just how many fans were disappointed by her apathetic ending of a (mostly) great series.  The series started declining around books eight and nine, but like many others, I kept reading, hoping to see an upswing.  This is the greatest example of an author selling out.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|This and part 2 of this epic film is just so awesome and amazing. Part of The Dark Knight Returns are about the first 2 chapters of the book of the same name. Peter Weller, who is most known for playing Robocop in Robocop and Robocop 2, voices Bruce Wayne aka Batman in this film, and it is just so awesome. Other great aspects about the film include the introduction of Carrie Kelly as the new Robin. Plus Two-Face getting his face repaired, but still having Two-Face in there. I highly recommend anyone get this as well as part 2 of this awesome film.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This album is absolutely insane. It is like \\"Alive or Just Breathing\\" on crack, steroids, and Jesus. I have slowly started to ignore this band, and their last release was mediocre at best. Seeing Jesse back on vocals brings back the nostalgia factor which is probably why I love this album so much. That or it is just that good. I am going to say that this is one of the best metal albums ever released. If you buy it, be prepared to ignore the rest of your music.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Batman: Under the Red Hood in my opinion is probably one of the coolest, and yet also most darkest of the DC Animated Batman Films. Based off of DC's Batman: A Death in the Family as well as the story line of the Red Hood, Batman encounters one of his deadliest villains yet: The Red Hood. I'd say this would be such a great Batman film, and would only recommend it to mature audiences such as teenagers, mostly due to the Darker tone of this film, as well as a lot more violence.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Love this game it's a amazing time killer and the online is amazing as well! Straight up 5 stars! A must buy!
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 is the conclusion to the epic Part 1 of the film. This film covers the last 2 chapters of The Dark Knight Returns. Great aspects of this film include the return of The Joker, Carrie Kelly as Robin helping Batman in his new war on crime, and of course Superman having to make a tough decision on how to take Batman in custody. I highly recommend this film as well as of course part 2, mostly because you can't see this film without seeing part 1. However, it's only recommended to those who can handle the Dark Content of these 2 films.
B003Y5H556|5.0|i like this movie and i had to buy it in blu ray, i already have it on dvd . but i still lovee the orginal movie&#34; the company of wolves plus the hunter is really cute !!!! and the story is much,much better i should know i bought the dvd and saw it on tv when i was a kid and never forgot it.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|fun game and all but what I think could improve is the fact that it is so hard and I almost never beat it.
B005LAII3A|5.0|this movie is better the the other total reecall , sorry that how i feel cause i have watched this movie 2 or 3 times til i had to buy it on dvd. i love this movie it's worth it to me!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|For the other reviews that complain about too many ads....quit complaining. There is only one ad after each game. The game is FREE and wrote very well. Ive played hundreds of hands and yet to see a duplicate dealing. There are no screw ups either. I love playing this version of solitaire when I have miles to kill on the elliptical trainer.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I choose this rating because it is a GREAT book.Diary of a Wimpy kid books are my favorite. I like this book because it is VERY entertaining I would recommend this book to my BFF, JoAnna Moody

B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is the best movie ang lee has ever done. this movie out beats brokeback mountain by a hundred percent. this is an amazing movie. the story is great and the actors are phenomenal. this is a good survival film and a good meaasge about god as well. because you never know what is going to happen and it's also realistic and that's what I liked about it. this is a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
1742200508|4.0|This is a travel book with a little bit of everything, and if your budget allows for only one book, you will likely survive your trip with this one.  It covers a great deal of what you need to know to scratch the surface of all of England.<br /><br />The first section is the Plan Your Trip section.  It covers the 20 Top Experiences, as well as the standard things you have to know for day-to-day life in a new place.  Money, travel tips, weather, etiquette; the basics are here.  For interests like \\"Royal England\\" or \\"Art Galleries\\", you'll find top six (or so) lists here.  Top events by month are listed, and several itineraries and walking trips cover everything from short walks to long tours.  There's a short Travel with Children section, and three paragraph summaries of each region.<br /><br />On the Road is the next and largest section.  London and Wessex get about 90 pages each, while all the other regions get 45-65 pages each.  There are maps, lists of best places to eat and stay, and sections on sights, tours, festivals & events, sleeping, eating, drinking, entertainment, and shopping.  For each region there's a bit on \\"Why Go?\\" and \\"When to Go,\\" and some history.<br /><br />This is where all the detailed information is, and this is where I searched for many things I didn't find.  I am certainly not an expert on England, yet many of my favorite things to do, pubs, restaurants, shops, and not just my favorite hotel but the whole area (with many hotels and restaurants) could not be found by searching the book or the index.  You will find all the standard tourist attractions, all the celebrity chefs' restaurants, the St. Pancras Renaissance and the easyHotel, but heck if I can find the pubs that are still owned by the locals or any of my favorite unique bookstores.<br /><br />Obviously every hotel and shop can't be included.  The book weighs almost a pound and a half as it is, and the text is small enough to give me a headache.  But while it is an excellent overview, I'd suggest carrying another book along with this one, with detailed information about the specific area you're in.  Or at the very least plan to get on the good side of some of the locals and ask them what their favorite restaurants are and where they go on their days off.  This book will guide you to the usual tourist attractions and the museums and castles you've seen in movies and TV shows (except, oddly, Highclere Castle, home of Downton Abbey), but if you want to see more of England than you've seen on the screen, you're going to need more in-depth information than can be found here.<br /><br />The next section is Understand England, with a page or ten for England Today, History, The English Table, Architecture in England, The English Landscape, The Arts, and Sporting England.  There are glossaries, a historical timeline, a few color photos, and references to websites for more information.<br /><br />At the end is the Survival Guide, a short chapter with a bit more information about the basic practicalities that were hinted at in the Plan Your Trip section.  If you've never been there, it's a good idea to read this section while actually planning your trip, to know about things like which power adapter to get and what kind of clothing to pack.<br /><br />The maps are OK, if a little difficult on the eyes.  The color maps in the London chapter are easier to read than the maps in the rest of the book.  The pull-out London map covers only central London and Hyde Park, and includes 10 Top Sights and a map of key bus routes and the Underground.  If you're planning to use buses or the Tube, pick up a better map at the stations.<br /><br />This would be a good first book to use to start planning a trip, and it really is an excellent overview of darn near everything.  But it lacks depth (as it must, given its size and the large subject it covers.)  Start here, but add other sources of information if you want to do more than scratch the surface of this wonderful country.ntry.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This movie is going to be an instant Halloween classic. this movie is awesome. I laughed through the whole thing. adam sandler is a perfect  voice for count Dracula. and the rest of the cast is hilarious. this is a movie the whole family can enjoy. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
193700788X|5.0|I thought Charlaine Harris did really well in \\"Dead Ever After\\" and had the perfect ending.  These fictional characters are from Ms. Harris' imagination and I've read this is how she envisioned her series ending since around the 2nd book.  I've enjoyed her imagination and characters and stories in all 13 books.  I for one like to see a \\"happy ever after\\" in a normal-ish way for our heroine after all these years.  Congrats on a job well done Ms. Harris!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Ian Richardson gives a masterful performance that I suspect will never be surpassed.  Spacy is a good actor but not in the same class as Richardson.<br /><br />The remastering was great.  The picture is crystal clear and best of all, it now has subtitles.

B00AR1G3FS|4.0|What would you not like about the Eagles Live?  No surprises, just a good video with great Eagles songs that you know and already love.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Engaging read with plot twists to the end. Finished this in less than five days. It draws you in giving you the urgent &#34;need to know what happens next&#34; drive to continue reading. I liked the back and forth voices of the characters. It leaves you always not quite sure.
1742200508|5.0|I've always been a fan of Lonely Planet travel guidebooks, especially back when my wife and I traveled to exotic, off-the-beaten-path destinations worldwide once or twice a year. The Lonely Planet books we used were great at steering us in the directions of things we were interested in seeing and doing. I have no use for guidebooks with page after page of pretty color pictures. I don't care much about pictures. I always wonder how many days the photographer waited to get perfect picture-postcard shots, or how much Photoshopping it took. I prefer thick guidebooks filled with dense, authoritative text, written by people who really know the areas. And maps--guidebooks are useless without maps. Lonely Planet's \\"England,\\" 7th Edition, is an outstanding example of exactly what I look for in a travel guidebook.<br /><br />This compact, tightly bound volume is thick--848 pages, an inch and a half. It's heavy--almost two pounds. And it's densely filled with small text in two-column format. It's a superb practical guide to England (NOT including Ireland, of course, nor Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, which, as I understand it, are part of Great Britain but not of England proper). There are almost no photos in the main text. Color photos do appear in the 12-page introductory section \\"20 Top Experiences,\\" and in the \\"Understand England\\" section starting on Page 763. That's about it for pictures. The rest of the volume is information. Lots of information--an almost overwhelming amount of information. Fortunately, it's very well organized, and about as user-friendly as it can get considering the vast quantity of material. Chapter headings, titles and sidebars stand out in eye-soothing shades of pale blue, which also highlight features on the more than 60 useful maps interspersed within the text. Of course, the savvy visitor will also pick up some of the fantastic Ordnance Survey maps of the country--they're the best maps you can buy. Blue tabs demark the sections keyed to 12 specific regions of England. This is the meat of the book, with more than 700 pages filled to bursting with comprehensive data, including phone numbers and websites, on attractions, lodging, restaurants, events and festivals, shopping, etc. As with all guidebooks, of course, some of this material may be out-of-date or flat wrong, but you certainly can't quibble about its breadth, depth and completeness. Since my last visit to England was several years ago, I can't judge the currency or accuracy of this material. As always, the prudent traveler will call in advance or seek other resources on-line before setting off.<br /><br />England offers so much to see and do that no single travel guidebook can possibly address every visitor's interests. Lonely Planet's \\"England\\" is no exception. I looked up in the 16-page index places I visited on prior trips, and many of them were not listed--the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, the National Motor Museum, the Tank Museum, the Fleet Air Arm Museum and the Bass Brewery, for example. If you're into museums, you should take along a separate book covering just the museums of England (fortunately, I had one of those with me on my trips).<br /><br />Don't think Lonely Planet's \\"England\\" is an armchair travel guide. Since it has so few photos, you won't find yourself leafing through it, spotting a stunning color picture and saying, \\"Wow, that looks like a great place to visit.\\" But, in my opinion, it IS one of the best guidebooks you can have when you're actually IN England. It's as complete a portrait of the country, its people and its activities as any I've seen. If you're an adventurous, curious, independent traveler, you should make sure it's in your suitcase or backpack on your next trip \\"across the pond.\\"specific regions of England.

B009L32R5I|5.0|Excellent choice of songs Steve picked. What a guitarist under rated what a shame. Definitely a find and great to have in my library.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|Most reviewers seem to be missing the point. Windtalkers is graphic in terms of the carnage of war,and not for the faint of hear but the violence is not done for the sake of sensationalistic violence, but a depiction of actual combat.Throughout the film, the main story IS of the Code Talkers of the Navaho Nation, who were primary and instrumental in victory of the allies in the Pacific. The film starts with them, and then weaves in the story of the marines who later work with them, including all the racism and down-treatment of the Navahos, and Nicholas Cage who plays the ultimate soldier dedicated to orders, with all the irony, that in fact, the Navaho efforts helped save many American lives (of the people who belittled them)...and ultimately victory. We in this current generation are used to theater wars, but this was the Big One, a World War, where the fate of the planet depended on the allies against global domination of evil.<br />Why it is in human nature to wage war is beyond this reviewer. After the sacrifice of so many lives in World War II and the holocaust in Europe and the Japanese POW concentration camps, as recently as 1994 it happened all over again, genocide and murder of innocents including children in Bosnia, and the worst atrocities of all , Srebrenicia.<br />Still this film is a testament to what is good about human nature, in the worst of circumstances, and also to ironies, but above all it is about the Windtalkers, the Navaho and their unique cultural heritage, and ultimatley how important saving that heritage proved to be, in that their language saved the West. From the beginning of the film at the reservation to the end back to the reservation, and all the respectful references in between to the unique rituals and beliefs of American Indians, this film is about the Navaho, and their contributions. How anyone can overlook this is beyond me.<br />Thanks for reading.

193700788X|5.0|I thought it fit Sookie and her story well.s, though, he was never about doing what was right for Sookie. As the books progressed, Eric became more and more proprietary, and Sookie lost that spark she had in the earlier books.<br />My biggest gripes with this series were the fairies taking over for a good five-book chunk. To me, that was too much. I lost interested in the story - even though I read every book. It was more like I was going through the motions.<br />I went into this book with a sense of relief that the series was coming to an end. It was time. I was ready. (Side note: Stephanie Plum should be put to rest right alongside Sookie)<br />I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the story. I was glad to see all the familiar faces - many of which were redeemed - and I was glad to see Sookie reclaim the life she always wanted but pushed aside so she could make room for Eric in her life.<br />At her heart, Sookie is an extraordinary woman that wants to be ordinary. She wants to hang out with her friends. She wants to have love in her life. She wants to exist - without people constantly threatening that existence.<br />Once Sookie's life became all about Eric, things changed. She became all about him. All about helping him. All about how she could do what she want - but make sure she didn't hurt him.<br />That wasn't the Sookie I fell in love with.<br />In the end, Harris did an admirable job putting her baby to bed. She should be glad that all the Eric fans are pitching fits and whining - that just means she did her job and created a world that people not only want to visit, but will miss.

That's an honest statement, yet in the context of my life it still sort of shocks me saying it, because in my time as a student, this was the most maligned of all of Bob Dylan's albums, at least by the hipper critics of the era (most notably in Rolling Stone).<br /><br />It was savaged by a lot of reviewers, mostly because it not only didn't conform to their expectations of what Dylan should have been doing (no doubt, from their point-of-view, writing the soundtrack for the revolution to come . . . .), but ran completely counter to who he seemed to be, in their eyes.<br /><br />It is laid back in tone and demeanor, even the live tracks with the Band from the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, whether he's doing folk, country, pop, or blues (even some New Orleans stylings), and also features lots of covers of other people's songs, including perhaps the best rendition of \\"Take A Message To Mary\\" that I've ever heard (with all due respect to the Everly Brothers). It's taken a while, but I've even come to enjoy (especially on CD) the live rendition of \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" from that Isle of Wight performance, which is a good showcase for the group as well.<br /><br />And it's all done with a simple, beguiling joy that comes from having unambitious (but richly textured) fun, albeit fun with a purpose. For SELF PORTRAIT is all about, essentially, Dylan reclaiming his own identity, musically and in popular culture, and demystifying himself in the process -- in effect, telling the world in 1970 that this is the stuff I like, it's where I came from musically (as much as Woody Guthrie -- already represented on his earlier output -- was), and that I want to do, and I'm not interested in anyone's opinion of it. Take it or leave it.<br /><br />A lot of critics (and some fans) couldn't accept that, and hated him for it, though the record did do quite well commercially at the time, charting high on both sides of the Atlantic (especially for a premium-priced double LP -- in the rock world of 1970, $15-$22 retail was a LOT of money even for a double album; and in the latter category, only the Beatles, the Cream, and the Who had really gotten away with charging that much at the time, with the \\"White Album,\\" Wheels Of Fire, and Tommy, respectively -- and the Cream's management had hedged their bets in England by splitting that album into two separate volumes); and it has always been in demand as a used LP, which tells you that Dylan was correct in his estimation of how unimportant the rock critics really were, at least where his music was concerned.<br /><br />But in terms of the record itself there's mostly stuff here to love in the listening, even really adore in the free-ranging nature of the sounds, from gospel to blues to pop (any album that linked Dylan's talent with that of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, via \\"Blue Moon,\\" deserved points for sheer daring in 1970 -- and Lord knows what Richard Rodgers thought of the recording itself, if he ever heard it). And he was leading the way, as usual, for a lot of other icons from the 1960s -- John Lennon and Paul McCartney abandoning the ambition, perfection and bold production of the Beatles' music, each for something more basic (and, in Lennon's case, bitterly personal, which probably, ultimately helped get him killed by attracting the mentally unwrapped and unstuck), the Moody Blues giving up on being the \\"world's smallest symphony orchestra\\" or pop mystics extraordinaire and declaring themselves to be just singers in the rock 'n' roll band . . . the big post-1960s demystifying of rock music (alas, mostly into a big business, except for those who chose to stay small) starts here.<br /><br />Listening to it in 2013, I suddenly realized -- the 1960s and its music (including Dylan's) liberated a lot of us. And SELF PORTRAIT was Dylan declaring his own liberation, in all of its laid back joy. I only wish they'd do a Deluxe version of this,perhaps with the outtakes that ended up on the 1973 \\"Dylan\\" album and the Isle of Wight tracks complete (or, at least, the ones here assembled together).<br /><br />And I thank Bob Dylan every day for releasing this record -- as I said, it's rapidly becoming my favorite of all of Bob Dylan's albums. And it may be, if my interpretation is correct, also the first actual Bob Dylan album (other than his debut), representing who Bob Dylan REALLY was, behind the public mask.perhaps with the outtakes that ended up on the 1973 \\"Dylan\\" album and the Isle of Wight tracks complete (or, at least, the ones here assembled together).<br /><br />And I thank Bob Dylan every day for releasing this record -- as I said, it's rapidly becoming my favorite of all of Bob Dylan's albums.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|Adorable movie, Drew Barrymore is a wonderful actress and in this movie she is excellent. Lots of humor and great ending.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I have never had a book freak me out as much as this one. I couldn't stop reading it. This author is extremely talented and I look forward to reading more from her!
B0090CMMIC|5.0|I haven't been able to stop listening to this band. This album is just one of those that I'll end up memorizing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Idid not think that I would enjoy it as I had been told that it was slow moving, a lot of talk and not much action.  However, I did not find it to be like that.  Yes, there is less action, but it is because we get to know the main characters better and how the human mind vs. the heart.  I would recommend this book from young adults to senior citizens.  I immediately ordered the third books which I am now reading, Mockingjay.
B004UXY5D6|5.0|By far my favorite Texas (Red Dirt) country band. Really nice guys too. They remind me of Lynyrd Skynyrd but maybe just a little more hick.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing amazing!!! Can't wait to read the next. Best trilogy I have read in years. Recommend to any age!!! You won't regretted read.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I loved the book because it was a fun way to go to the most common type and nothing to do.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|He's 4, and just learning to tell time, and play soccer, so this was a good buy. The price is good, because he'll probably loose it immediately, but for the time being, it's a lot of fun. He likes re-arranging the colors on the band.
193700788X|1.0|Just read all the other bad reviews they are accurate. The characters did not even resemble themselves. It was terrible
193700788X|4.0|A lot of people here are disappointed in the ending of the series.  I am not one of them.  I've read all the books (started before the series on HBO)and I've always viewed the world of the novels as distinctly different from the world on True Blood.<br /><br />SPOILERS***************************************<br />If you hadn't figured out that Sookie was going to end up with Sam, you weren't paying attention or you are a Truebie in need of an intervention.  It was clear from book 1 that Sookie could not end up with a vampire unless she herself became one, and that was never going to happen.  The nighttime world of vamps is not for our Sookie who loves sunbathing and wants children.  I thought it was always clear that Sookie would end up with someone living, and that meant Sam, Alcide, or Quinn.  For various reasons Alcide and Quinn weren't the men for her.  Sam, on the other hand, has always had great chemistry with Sookie.  Besides the fireworks (hinted at but never detonated), they are best friends, which anyone who has been married for a long time will tell you is essential to a lifelong relationship.<br /><br />Now, if you are a show watcher late to the books, you might have trouble envisioning Sam as anyone other than Sam Trammell.  Side note - I think he is poorly cast, as he looks and acts nothing like Sam in the books.  I always envisioned someone more like Aaron Eckhart or Kevin McKidd playing Sam.  I can understand the disappointment of Sookie ending up with show Sam, but book Sam has always been sexier and more stable.  You know the two of them will run Merlottes, have several children and grow old together as mainstays of the Bon Temps community.<br /><br />I did have a couple of issues with the book, the biggest one being the last minute appearance of Claude.  I've always had a problem with the fae storyline, and Claude's cameo was a little too deus ex machina for me.  I didn't need to see Quinn again either, although I understood that throwing him in gave a sense of closure for the Quinn/Sookie holdouts.  I've also had ongoing troubles with Mr. Cataliades since it was revealed that he can read minds and is the reason Sookie is a telepath.  If he could read minds, why did Sookie have to go to Rhodes back in All Together Dead?  Mr. C went from being an intriguing character to a useful plot device and that has always bothered me.<br /><br />I was never a huge fan of Eric and Sookie; I know that puts me in the minority, but I have known and dated men like Eric (selfish, power hungry, sexy but self-centered) and so the character didn't turn me on.  I prefer gentlemen, so I liked Bill and I like Sam.  The ending of Sookie's relationship with Eric was quick and brutal, but sometimes that's how it works.  There truly is no good way to break up with someone, and the fact of it is Eric wanted to be powerful and perhaps eventually a king more than he wanted Sookie. Also, he would have eventually turned her because he never could understand not wanting to be a vampire.<br /><br />All in all I thought it was a nice ending to a fun series.  I will miss spending time with Sookie.  I always felt like the books were a little vacation to Bon Temps, a chance to spend some time with people who were quirky but charming.  I will miss them, but at least I can always reread the books.
0385349947|2.0|I purchased 3 copies of this book to give it to my closest friends for Mothers Day and when I received the shipment, I noticed that the bound pages were not cut evenly and very untidy. I am quiet surprised. It looks as though it was rejects that did not make it through the Quality Checks by the publisher.<br /><br />I hope to hear from you regarding this.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Christine Toguchi
B009NY43NY|1.0|I remember gobbling up the first few books in this series. As time progressed and the ending neared, the writing and story line just seemed not worth my money or time. Now this? I feel ripped off. What was she thinking when she wrote this? There are so many problems with this book that I don't even care who her HEA is at this point. This is a series that just went downhill and I am disappointed that I wasted my energy on this last book.
B008Q08EV8|3.0|I love these types of movies but this one didn't give enough details about the training of the Centurion Soldiers.  And want it meant to be named a Centurion in the ROMAN Army.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the best in the series. Now this is a warning to all you folks that don't want to know about it until you read it yourself so DO NOT KEEP READING SPOILERS AHEAD. I find it very sad that prim dies. I almost cried at that part. I also don't like the death of Finnick. He was a cool guy. Also deaths of the other people and all but those two were the main ones that really affected me. I do not exactly get the part when Katniss \\"Catnip\\" :) shoots Coin. This book was one of the best ones i have ever read. A true masterpiece. Some of my favorite characters are: Finnick, Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Prim, Beetee, Boggs, Haymitch, Katniss's mom, The three stylists, Rue, and Cinna
B007B6T3K4|5.0|Damn, what a masterpiece!  I had heard a few songs from these guys before, but nothing prepared me for this. Their first single \\"Valentine\\" might be just the 5th best song in there. \\"Forevermore\\", \\"Euphoria\\", \\"A Thousand Letters\\", and \\"When The Mirror Cracks\\" are my favorites.  \\"Forevermore\\" is a song of the year caliber tune.  Xandria just gained a new fan.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Another historical treasure by Ken Follett. It certainly leaves the reader ready and anxious for Book Two in the series.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|this is a fine film I never watched any of the harry potter movies so I didn't know if danial radcliffe was any good.<br />He is very good in this movie playing an account lawyer with a tortured soul grieving the lost of his wife.he has one last change to save his job by taking a job settling the astate of a old house.this movie is just plain eerie no slashing or or blood just scary as hell.
193700788X|3.0|Spoilers of course. I like where the story ended. I am a diehard Eric fan and I still like the story ending. However, I can't help to feel that the story was rushed. I can accept the changes in Sookies personality bc she has been through he'll and back and that should change a character, but the inner Sookies monologue in this book was just missing or glossed over. I love her friends, human and otherwise coming together for her. Not the best layeed out book ever, but it was what I felt to be the best possible ending for the series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Exactly what I needed to organize all my to do lists as well as any lecture notes. The ability to store pictures and links within the same note makes it useful for Christmas lists and the like.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I am in love with each song, especially Mirrors, Spaceship Coupe and Strawberry Bubblegum. Can't wait to see him in concert!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved the one it starts with but don't like so much this Tokyo one. You should be able to choose between the two of which one you want to play
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I loved the book. It addressed everything I wanted to know. Great read, but long. It was worth it. I'm happy I finally know the end of the series.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|The first season of this show was very well done. By now I am sure you know the premise (if not, please see end of review). I love the characters and, obviously, the vivacious Evil Queen/Mayor Regina Mills, played by the ridiculously gorgeous Lana Parrilla. Get ready to fall in love, boys and girls, this woman is a heart-crusher (yea, I said it!). She steals the show with her many personalities of Regina in flashbacks and present-time storytelling. Although this season has been a little scattered in character development and plot progression, I still have such high hopes that it will continue to be a top-rated show. As many others have voiced, I would like to see the writers delve into the early years of Regina and her sons relationship. Also, I too share the views of most in the popular issue of how adoption is portrayed on the show. All that aside, it really is a show that deserves its chance on television.<br /><br />If it's not a series for you, buy it anyway and the moment you spot Regina, you will see exactly what I am talking about. GO WATCH LANA NOW because either way, you're welcome. :D<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />For those that don't know the premise of the show, it tells the story of the fairytale characters you grew up reading in books, more specifically that of Snow White- except you get to see what happened after she was woken up by true love's kiss. Snow White, Prince Charming and many other well-known characters are cursed by the Evil Queen into a world without magic (our world) and into a small town in Maine, where they lived their lives for 28 years with no memory of their former selves. The show has grown with such great twists and turns in the lives these beloved characters. I urge you to watch from season 1- great show for adults.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love, love, love.  So wonderful to be able to watch over & over whenever I want! Now I need to get my husband hooked before season 4 begins on TV.
1608871045|5.0|I was really surprised at how much this manual really does look like a manual!  It covers all three TDK movies, including bios of all those bad guys.<br /><br />Includes schematics of the Batcave, Tumbler, Batpod, even the Batsuits.  It is SICK.  Goes great in the Batcave.
0061914177|1.0|Anyone can find success if they have $4 mil to originally invest!  Not what I expected at all (from the i8nitial review).
B004QX07G4|5.0|Great book. It's everything you expect from Ellen and more.  If you're feeling sad read this and I promise you will laugh and smile.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Honestly one of the best books I've ever read. Very moving and heartbreaking. Teaches you to live your life to the fullest
193700788X|1.0|If I could go door to door and make sure no one even thought about buying this book, I would.  Please, some one tell me how in the world did this get published?! I'm a kindergarten teacher and I've read better stories and sentence structure from 5 and 6 year olds.  I knew after the first 2 pages, I was screwed.  I went from reading to see what was going to happen to reading to see how many errors I could spot on each page.  I needed a virtual red marker to correct mistakes!  Well, this book gets a big fat F!  There are many reviews that say things so eloquently so I'll just add, shame on you Ms. Harris.  Shame on you for giving up.  Shame on you for turning out crap.  Shame on you for seeming so arrogant as to not care if your readership hates your writing.  You like to say you write for yourself.  Actually, because you charge me for reading your work, you write for me.  And for all of us who've been so invested only to be completely let down.  I had my personal choice for the HEA, but I would have settled for at least something that felt authentic.  I'm angry that Harris basically is giving the middle finger to people who've invested years and hard earned money on her books.  Um, so yeah, this book is terrible!
193700788X|5.0|I read literally hundreds of books each year, but this is the first review I have ever written. This is because I think written word can mean and be interpreted differently by different people. This is an important part of why reading and good story writing is so important. I did, in this case, feel compelled to defend this book, this series and this author.<br /><br />I have loved this series. For those whom felt there was no foreshadowing, I believe they were only \\"hearing\\" what they wanted to \\"hear\\" while reading. I felt that this would be the only appropriate ending to this series since reading the first book.  Sookie had said the times she had kissed Sam that the only reason she didn't pursue him was because he was her boss and she didn't want to change the dynamic of that relationship. As a real person, I can respect and agree with that sentiment. She was trying to be smart about it and not ruin a job that was her only source of income in a small town. I don't know if many of you have been in that position or can imagine what that would be like. She had no other options, or very few, as far as career. She didn't want to have a relationship, despite her feelings, becuase as we all know some relationships don't last. Then where would she be? With a house and life to live and no income. She now has financial security and a say in the business. This allows her to be more comfortable with any possible outcome of their relationship. Every time they were together intimately, there were fireworks. If you read again, you may see it differently... As far as doing things \\"true to character\\" I don't see how this could have been any truer to their characters. We all go through periods of growth or periods of time when we make some decisions that we may have made differently had we looked at them with our \\"true character\\" those are the things we end up hopefully learning from.  Sookie may have spent a few years in her 20's chasing around with dangerous, sexy men (which manyother people try out :) in real life), but that was never the person she was or her goal for her life. Her ending up with Eric or Bill would have been the least \\"true to character\\" thing that could have happened. Eric may have loved Sookie, but only as much as Eric can ever love anyone that is not himself. Yes, he was dynamic, funny and an absolute blast to know. That does not mean he was a truly reliable or steadfast being to his core. I know a lot of people in real life who are bigger than life and awesome to be around, but I wouldn't be leaving them my children to raise if I died or trust them with my whole heart or deepest secrets.  He was always going to do what was best for number 1, himself. That is why Sookie never trusted him completely and was waiting for the other shoe to drop. She loved him, but he was never to be her one great love. Sookie kept closest people who were good to their core, reliable, hard working and who appreciated the good/simple things in life. Bill's personality may have been closer to that, but were she a real person, she NEVER would have stayed with a vampire. This was too far from her core values and goals. Her home was Bon Temps, her only remaining family and her core support group, all in Bon Temps. This is what was meant to happen, people and if you can't see that, then you are the one who truly didn't understand Sookie or the other characters in the book, not the author.<br /><br />I did feel in certain parts of the books that certain themes or story lines were forced or rushed, but it is already a 13 book series. Some things had to be summarized and delivered quickly or it would be 30 books and then you would all really be complaining when it didn't end just the way you wanted!! (I would have been happy to read 30..) The great thing about a great storyteller is that they can take you along on a journey that you never could have thought of or dreamed up yourself. Charlaine truly is able to do that. I applaud her for that and admire her talent. My only wish for this final book is that it would have gone a little farther into the future and into tying things up, but it looks like CH may be planning on doing that this fall with a kind of tie it all up Sookie summary?? Maybe I read that wrong though somewhere. I would be happy to read one last look into the future of Sookie and hope that is the case.<br /><br />Remember to relax, enjoy and escape when you read. If you find yourself always looking for problems or discrepancies in movies, books or other forms of entertainment, you will never be truly entertained. I can't stand it when people watch movies and say \\"did you see/hear that? That would never happen.\\"  Isn't that quite the point?

B00A81NFAS|4.0|I don't support modern psychiatric mind control drug culture, so I faulted the movie one star for that... which is actually more crucial to may personal view of life. The great acting save this movie from the hack writing and pathetic story plot. Jennifer Lawrence has about 3 stellar, emotionally charged dynamic scenes although Cooper is the main driving force in the story. I've watched it countless times already and am quite convinced of my opinion that it's the acting that makes this lack luster story actually work as a light drama, and decent romanic movie.<br /><br />The reason I object to the psycho babble drug culture/$$$/mind control/political weapon is that the main character has a typical male reaction to finding his wife have sex with a colleague in HIS SHOWER, and the guy having sex with his wife tells him \\" I think you should go\\" in his own house? this is reason for the husband to seek therapy and get doped up on drugs? while we come to find that the male colleague who broke up his marriage is STILL WORKING AT THE SCHOOL/COLLEGE as if HE DID NO WRONG? give me a break, that is drug culture psycho babble propaganda and I won't ever accept that crap. Bipolar? lol it's a joke, humans have emotions, feelings and reactions and it's normal to have moods, what the modern drug culture is preaching is mind control state of zombies, easy to make money off of them and easy to control them or lock people away like slave masters.

B00846REIS|5.0|starts off a lot like fifty shades, but definitely worth the read when you continue, I liked it much more than fifty
193700788X|3.0|I feel like I'm the only one that felt this way but I wanted Sookie to end up with Sam. So in a way I got what I wanted. I almost feel like Harris should have wrapped it up in 2 books but she had decided she was done. There was t any resolution with Bill which was kind of disappointing but I guess I was happy because its looking good for Sookie and Sam now and that's how I wanted it.
193700788X|1.0|This is possibly one of the worst endings to a series that I have ever had the misfortune to experience. It was very obvious that Ms. Harris does not give a care about her fan base. She finished the book just to end it , she got her money she was done writing this series like 4 books ago but just continued to finish out her contract.It is poorly written, not cohesive to her prior stories and seems \\" rushed\\". Shame on Authors like her , writting is a gift and she wasted it.
B00ADR2DTG|5.0|It's a great little tube amp for the money. There are many like it, but this one is mine and it works and sounds great. I suggest swapping out the tube for another, but it still sounds good with the stock tube.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I love Paul Rudd movies and the case does a great job with the story. However, the story itself gets a little depressing. I was hoping to come away with a lot more laughs, to be honest.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great book.  I could hardly put it down.  Even when I wasn't reading, I found myself thinking about Amy, Nick and Go.  This book had so many twists and turns designed to captivate.  I can't wait to start her next book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book was hooked from the start. The entire series was just completely awesome. I would suggest this book to those who are fans of good reading.
B009NY43NY|5.0|It is not what I expected, but in many ways better, sad it had to end, happy how it ended!
B001I45UFC|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy book to read and a different depiction on Christianity.
B00BZODDYU|4.0|In a genre that has been to watered down over the last decade this movie caught me offguard.  Though it seemed a bit slow in the begining, I was actually impressed that they did a great job of bringing the main characters to life. When it is all over every minute they used in the begining for character development was important.  Early on I was concerned that the female lead was poorly chosen, that she didn't represent the type of woman that the male lead would have been interesed in.  However, 20 minutes into the movie and that concern was gone.  The acting from the little girls and up was all spot on.  The two girls were impressive for their age but I think the youngest girl was perfect in this role and by then end of this movie I was invested in ALL of the main characters including the spirit.  This movie was enjoyable to watch they was no sex, nudity or even foul language.  All in all one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time and I would gladly reccomend it to my friends and family.  The only thing I would add is that parents should observe the PG-13 rating the movie is not for young children.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Great game with excellent controls and simple learning curve!  Great for quick bouts of boredom, or the long restless night.

And how well he did.<br />Rod still rules and continues doing shows and gigging everywhere!<br />ROD STEWART Thanks for your music all these years and for making us feel the same emotion that 20 or 30 years ago when we listen to it!!!<br />Proud to be a Rod Stewart fan more than ever!
B006MOW98E|4.0|This was a cute book. I am a fan of John Green and so I decided to purchase it. All three stories start out sort of sad but the endings leave you feeling happy.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I still enjoy the few books in the middle on Sookie and Eric's courtship and relationship.  It seems a bit convoluted to get to where she is at the end. It's also a bit engineered to have Eric out of the picture given what they'd been through. Disappointing second to last and last books to the awesome series.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I like this one a lot but I only gave it 3 stars because it really hurts my knees.  I stopped doing it and noticed that my knees don't hurt when I use other low impact workout dvd's - maybe if I lose some more weight I'll pick it back up again but I did really liked that it was only 20 minutes.
B005KELQEU|3.0|This sleeve would be perfect if it was actually as long as the description for kindle. However, it's about 1/2 to 3/4 inches to0 small for the kindle. Otherwise, it is a small little neoprene case that I really wish would work. Seamless return made it easy for me to order one that will most probably work.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|The author told me that dieting correctly and training correctly could eventually lead to strong and lean body. All I needed to do was to simply follow what the author advised in this book, which was based on scientific researches. The rules are clear and simple and easy to follow. They are not scary at all. The important thing was doing the right thing continuously, which should be the hardest part of book. But the author helped with that. He helped me to build my confidence in the book, and made me believe that I could do it. So now I'm going to do it to become bigger, leaner, and stronger.

B009T8XBBO|1.0|This app sounded like one that would be interesting and fun but it isn't. You watch one or two little guys run around your screen. Everything you need to do is highlighted and you click on it yet the touch screen controls for this game are very unresponsive which affects game play greatly. I thought it was my kindle but all my other games worked perfectly. This game is very boring and insanely dumb.

B004J4WN0I|3.0|Maybe I just love cliches too much, or maybe I want to be surprised, but something about Atticus O'Sullivan doesn't add up. The writing was clever, the characters interesting if not completely novel (that's fine, it's not easy!), but I just am not compelled to pick up the next book. Why? For me, the idea of living for 2100 years is pretty damn terrifying. If you do, you have a reason. If you have such a great fear of death, then why? If you can't die, that's fine, but that's not the hero's problem - even if he negotiates deals to that effect. You have to have a driving force, a reason, and I really didn't get that sense at all. If this is revealed in later books, great, but make some canny but subtle allusions to that. OTherwise, hero comes off a bit detached, but strangely passionate without object, disconnected from those around him except from his (awesome) dog.

B009NY43NY|4.0|Spoiler Alert*****The prologue of the book was a bit confusing.  It set up a new story line for a villian who dislikes Sookie.  But ok, that's fine.  The problem with this is, the villian changed towards the end of the book. But again, OK.  I got it.  The first chapter begins the next day after Sookie had brought Sam back to life.  Arlene is bailed out of jail and used in a plot to get revenge on Sookie.  I can't fathom why people are so upset about the change in Eric.  It actually started in the previous book.  He put his maker's request for a marriage with a vampire queen above his love for Sookie.  Like Sookie thought, he didn't need the wish to get him out of his marriage plans.  He could have been strong and done that on his own.  To keep up with the marriage plot, he has Sookie come to his office to break the vampire marriage they had together.  At this point, he wants to continue to be king but also have Sookie on the side as a mistress.  He wanted his cake and eat it too.  Glad Sookie put a stop to that.  Eric becomes upset when he discovers that Sookie won't even consider being changed to a vampire to be with him.  How did people think they would be together if Charlaine Harris had decided to keep Eric as her lover?  She would continue aging unless she agreed to become a vampire.  She never wanted to become one.  She sees this side of Eric and realizes that she was in love with someone she didn't know.  I can understand her wish to hurry it along to get Eric out of the picture to live his live with his new queen.<br /><br />Bill - After Sookie discovers Bill's betrayal a few books back in how he came to be in her life, she was able to forgive him, but she never had the same feelings for him.  She remembered her love for him since he was her first, but it was never portrayed that she would get back together with him.  They became good friends.  Again, same problem with Eric, she would age if she got back together with him, and she didn't want to become a vampire.<br /><br />Sam - OK, he wasn't portrayed as a love interest to Sookie in the past few books, but he was always there when she needed him.  I think she started to care for him slowly.  So slow, I don't think she even realized what was happening until he died and she used the gift to bring him back to life.  Being brought back to life is life changing.  Sam started thinking about what matters and realized he had the best thing in his life already, Sookie.<br /><br />I don't understand all of the 1 star reviewers hatred for the book.  It almost seems like its planned to make this book a low rating.  One reviewer even sent out a request for everyone to put in a one star review.  A couple of people put in a low review and they haven't even read the book yet.  Where is the sense in that?  OK, I understand, she didn't end up with Eric, but really, if you really knew Sookie, why would she end up with him?  He couldn't live in the sun with her, he couldn't give her children, she didn't want to become a vampire to join him.  Love doesn't always conquer all. For those who wanted her to go back with Bill, where in the last few books showed any signs of that happening?  They had their memories of the love the shared, but I think they both grew up and were past that.<br /><br />The version of this book I had was the audio version (great series in audio-narrator is fabulous).  Listening to it, I guess I got more out of the book than from reading it.  I got emotional on Sookie's low point of the book and was glad she had friends and family to help her get back on her feet.  Anyway, that's all for now.  Bring on the bashing comments for not giving this a low rating.

B009NY43NY|1.0|The book was a train wreck! All of the progress that Sookie has made throughout the series is completely gone. The character of Eric is completely destroyed. And the fact that Sookie ends up with Sam makes absolutely no sense. The entire book felt like it was rushed,and all together disrespected the relationship between Sookie and Eric. I had read the spoilers and I already knew how it ended but wanted to give it a chance anyway to see how exactly they got there. Boy was that a complete mistake. The author spent most of the series building up the relationship between Sookie and Eric, made us root for them, just to turn around and slap us in the face. Just like a good movie is ruined by a bad ending,this series is ruined by a terrible ending. Had I known when I started reading the series that I would be left feeling this disappointed at the end I would have never bothered and saved my $195. I understand the characters belong to the author and she could do anything she wants with them, but she toyed with the readers book after book just to make money, and that is just wrong.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Picked up from the first one never missing a beat. I fell more in love with the characters and can't wait to get to know them even better. Loved the mystery, excitement, heartache, lust and love all combined in this novel. Just keeps getting better.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game is fun, challenging, and extremely well done.  There are useful hints if you truly get stuck. The only reason I am rating this game 4 stars is the whole &quot;channeling Ishtar&quot; thing.  It makes perfect sense with the storyline, I just don't like that sort of stuff.
1933492953|5.0|This book is a must have. I have an extensive library of books, and rarely do I find one that is full of practical and useful information let alone at this price range.<br /><br />What I love most about it is that it teaches you (with tons of examples from the author) to deal with the message on an abstract level, ie through pictorial organization (line, shape, focal point, value pattern etc.) This means you have complete freedom to compose your picture how you want (and should) and then fill it in with details/\\"stuff.\\" The book then builds from there, ie one frame then multiple.<br /><br />It's like spending a month with the artist as he \\"teaches\\" you the tools of the trade.
B009NY43NY|4.0|All the questions are answered and the loose ends tied up. A lot of Sookie \\"hate\\" makes this sort of dark, but I enjoyed the book.
193700788X|1.0|I thought am I really reading a CH book?? It was poorly written. I hate how she ended things with Eric. No fight from Eric or anything?? It just stinks. I would have rather seen Sookie with Alcede or even Bill. I like Sam but not with Sookie. BLEH!!!!

B007EE4XKI|4.0|[TAKE NOTE THAT THIS BOOK IS PART OF A SERIES, BOOK 1 OF 3]<br /><br />As a big fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and of Data and all things Data-related, I loved this book! [spoiler imminent, shields up] If the thought of a resurrection of Data [ :D ] or an inside look at the last [?] years of the not-so-dead Noonien Soong has you staring wide-eyed at this review by now, then you'll definitely want to get this book.<br /><br />There's the praise; now here's the not-so-great stuff:<br /><br />I would have given this book a 5-star rating, but frankly I feel that it could have been written better. Even though I would consider myself very well-versed in Star Trek lore, especially TNG, I found myself pretty confused and disoriented in the beginning of the book. I frankly found it hard to figure out what exactly was going on. Plus, since the story is set quite a while after the tv series and movies, it took me a while to sort out and accustom myself to the changes that had occurred since that time, and make sense of some of the events alluded to in the story; many of which I'm still in the dark about. I think this may be partially to blame on the fact that it appears that the book/series is to some degree somewhat intertwined with other books and series the author must have expected the readers to be familiar with.<br /><br />So, I personally found the beginning rather frustrating, which did not make for a very pleasant start to a book. So I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is new to Star Trek; you'll just find yourself painfully confused. This is a book for people who are intimately familiar with the subject matter.<br /><br />Another thing; when looking over the table of contents and the introductions at the start of my read, I was dismayed to learn it was split into 3 parts: The beginning, then a jump into the past for a while, and then finally back to the present. I hate it when they set books up like that. Upon reaching the middle section, you usually find yourself highly annoyed to have to abandon the story just when it was starting to get interesting and delve deep into a totally new back-story when all that you really want to know is what happens next.<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find it otherwise this time. While the middle part did come way too soon it seemed, I was surprised to find myself suddenly thrown into a fascinating fast-paced first-person narrative from the character Dr. Soong himself that lasted until part three; practically 2/3 of the book it seemed, but immensely interesting nonetheless. So I appreciated that. But why couldn't they have done the book in chronological order? That would have been so much nicer...<br /><br />It also would have been nicer to have a happier ending too. Yeah, I know not every book should end \\"happily-ever-after,\\" but there just seemed to be too many disappointments in the book; those things that you'd really, really like to see turn out all right, but sadly don't. Just sayin'......<br /><br />So in conclusion, I enjoyed this book, and I think that many others will too, but I can't help but say that the writing felt a little weak. If you are very familiar with Star Trek: TNG, and the backstories of Data and Dr. Noonien Soong, then I'm sure you'll love this book. But if you aren't, I'd suggest looking for another book to read.

I wish I'd never wasted any time or $ reading these books if CH was going to completely UNREALISTICALLY RANDOMLY HORRIBLY make it all end this way...SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />..... SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Sookie ends up with SAM? the guy she's never had real feelings for? RANDOM NONSENSE. and the way her and Eric ended after all this? I feel like Harris was scared of the pressure ever since the show TrueBlood came out. and ever since book 10 its been worse and worse like a diff author. Ive never been more disappointed in my life of the hundreds of booke I've read. I'm canceling my order of the next future glimpse sookie book.

1451695195|1.0|I am a deeply devoted and spiritual christian who whole heartily believes in visions.  So, I offer my gravest warnings about this book.  This is nothing more than another form of universalism. There is but one that can save your soul and he is Jesus, and this book has nothing to do with him whatsoever.  I suspect that this is the same type of experience that is foundational for many false religions. I was so disturbed by the book and the man that wrote it that I did not even finish it. I deposited it in the trash.

B009RH9FR6|2.0|[[ASIN:B009RH9FR6 Marware Revolve Genuine Leather Rotating, Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Black (only fits Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]]<br /><br />As others have pointed out this is a heavy case which may be good to protect against drops or bumping unless it is bumped against something thin enough to get in between the front and back cover since this is not fully enclosed. I use my Kindle mostly while in a special recliner due to severe back problems, on my lap or on my side so I wanted to have it sit up in my lap and revert to handheld when on my side so weight is an issue.<br /><br />Secondly, it does neither well. Others have talked about the worthless angles it stands at but it also does NOT truly lock into those positions so if you tilt the base backward (front edge up slightly) the \\"clips\\" slid out of their mating slots and it collapses!<br /><br />The idea of the hand strap being used for handheld reading is laughable. As Ralph Furlong (11/30/2012) stated and I quote, \\"...you MUST keep the strap at the bottom when you insert your (either left or right hand) hand so that you can use your thumb to keep the unit from flipping open!!!...Thus, if you move your thumb off of the Kindle, it will probably flip away from you!\\" 'Nough said on that! (Thanks for the excellent review BTW Ralph!) I wish I'd seen it before I bought this case. :( B. McCarthy (12/11/2012) elaborates some more, \\"7. The hand strap is useless. If you hold it open like that, the device is secured only to one side and can flap about. If you are going to put in a hand strap, this should provide secure and stable device placement.\\" I make a big deal of this since it is critical to me. Before buying I suggest you read both their reviews. Ralph's is at http://www.amazon.com/review/R16PN69FJM9KEM/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RH9FR6&nodeID=370783011&store=fiona-hardware and B. McCarthy's is at http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HC9549CZAKNN/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp. Sorry for the long URLs. Too bad they don't change to hyperlinks in reviews. They're both worth the little trouble of copy and pasting into your browser though.<br /><br />The one good thing about this is the price has dropped to $19.99 in black as of 5/08/2013. Green is much higher for some reason ($44.95)! Green dye might be a good investment now! :-)

B00BQ1D91E|5.0|I've had this record on the turntable since I got it. The vinyl is great, if you are thinking about getting it. Its gatefold, with 1 red vinyl record. It isn't heavyweight, too bad, and it sticks to the standard of new releases on vinyl, where you get a plain white sleeve instead of one with sleeve art. What's up with that? Anyway, the sound is what really matters and the production is what you'd expect to get from a high caliber recording.<br /><br />Every time I've read a review that compares a band to a 70s or 80s band, usual suspects being BOC and Mercyful Fate, I don't hear it at all. So, to me, Ghost sounds like Ghost. In today's day and age, you can go to grooveshark or youtube and sample their music, so I won't try to describe their sound. Infestissumam is orchestral, and more lush and textured than Opus. Its got great hooks, melody, musical craftsmanship, and of course, Satan. What else can a girl want? I love it! A superb sophomore release that exceeds their first great release.<br /><br />Update: They killed it at Webster Hall in NYC! If you get a chance to see them live, don't miss it. Ghost knows how to put on a show: great atmosphere and theatrics (of a subdued, intense sort). Papa Emeritus II has a Shakespearean vibe going on (Papa, if you are looking for a second career, look no further). The music was powerful and sounded perfect. Just what I was hoping for. No deterioration whatsoever from the studio.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|With the good of graphics this game has wouldn't an average gamer expect it to take some memory? This game is free and the graphics are fantastic! But idk what some people are talking about saying it's like temple run?? It's nothing like temple run believe me, it's a completely different experience not even comparable to temple run. You are in a constant flight and switch between low to the street and in air tilting your device to avoid obstacles. You tap or swipe to attack enemies that show up when you are in the air. There's collectibles and &quot;stark credit.&quot; Lots of armour costumes, which is also why I have it 4 stars. There's a chain of them that you unlock, the first one is 2,000 - that's reasonable. The very next one is like 20-40,000...it's like really??? It is really fun though!!<br /><br />Tip: I found it easier to attack of you hold your device in one hand and use your other hand to tap to attack more efficiently.
1559210400|5.0|I had hard time getting this book in Asia.  When I ordered and delivered to me, I completed reading in 2 days.<br /><br />I must thank my friend who recommended to get hold of this novel to read.  True to her recommendation, the late Ms Buck had great foresight in knowing what China moves after the late Mao passed on since this book is written before 1969.  She narrates the story well by blending the happenings of China on to the Liang's family particularly Mdm Liang and her 3 daughters.<br /><br />The elder and second daughters' love for their homeland and how each differs later were contrasting and touching. Embedded in the 2 older girls' happenings, the author shared what was happening to the country's road to revolution (/Communism) depicting the rise and fall of the campaigns in 50s-60s.  Ms Buck did not elaborate much of the people's sufferings but thru the 2 daughters, I can feel the confusion and despair the nation set for their citizens during that time.<br /><br />I don't know after reading of this novel, I feel proud to be a (Overseas) Chinese.  Is it the ancient China's invention or their strong will to live on through the difficult times. This feeling is hard to describe but I am glad that China has come out of darkness.<br /><br />This is well written story, powerful with great flow.  Read it if you love Eastern history and story.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|The start of the long story is exciting and make it difficult for me to stop reading.  The dilemma of me to decide to read this novel by George R R Martin was a &#34;want to&#34; or &#34;don't want&#34; decision.<br /><br />The reason  of &#34;want to&#34; being that the author has great imagination to write the novel with interesting characters. Each character he created has distinct characters and through his pen, he allows me to visualise his creations.  Another reason, which is cliche, the novel receives pretty good reviews and has turned to be a TV drama (though I had not watch any seasons of them).<br /><br />The &#34;don't-want&#34; is simply the story telling of AGOT is way too long.  I am not a very patient person to sit thru each book reading that requires 1 month.  With more of his literature making, I am afraid that my attention to this novel will be dampened.  For example, J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter 7 fantasy parts nearly make me give up and I have to keep on going back to the previous book when beginning the new release of a new part.  The long lapses of time create my &#34;memory lost&#34; and forgotten the last &#34;happenings&#34; of the story line. I am worried that I have the same experiences with AGOT.<br /><br />No, I am not saying that this is bad story.  In fact, it is good and go for it if you love fantasy, medieval times.

B006DZYM0A|4.0|Margaret is a film about  a young woman (Lisa), living in NYC, who attends private high school.  She is child of intellectuals and is at the age when she is aware of her sexual appeal to men.  Her parents are divorced and her father lives on the West Coast.  Her mother is a Broadway actress, which means that Lisa and her younger brother get to spend a lot of time on their own when their mother is rehearsing or performing.<br /><br />Lisa is not a problem kid, she is curious about the adolosence and not quite sure how to deal with it since there is no one (no adult) available to talk to her about it.  One day, Lisa's action of distracting a bus driver ends in tragedy - a woman gets killed crossing pedestrian when driver runs the red light.  Lisa realizes she is a partial reason for what happened but does not acknowledge that right away to herself, her parents and police investigators of the accident.  As expected, our unconscious mind has a way of catching up with us in the most unopportune times.  Suddently, Lisa starts neglecting her schoolwork, she is irritable when dealing with her mother and school friends and she attempts to dull her emotional pain by having sex with her high school mate and later on her geometry teacher.  Needless to say, such escape(s) bring Lisa no relief - as a matter of fact, it only brings her additional problems.<br /><br />Perhaps Lisa is spoilt, perhaps her view of right and wrong is a little confusing to her (do not forget that she is only a teenager and she is quite impulsive), but eventually her grief over what happened during the bus accident catches up with her.  Lisa's life is changed forever and she ultimately grows up overnight.<br /><br />This is a complex movie, perhaps more suited for stage than film.  However, it kept my attention from start to finish.  I particularly liked the film ending.  It is unexpected, but it does bring relief and at least some sense of closure with hope for Lisa's future and her understanding of other people's needs, motives, loss and love.  This movie is not meant for superficial people - it is too multidimensional for general public.  It requires sophisticated audiences.er people's needs, motives, loss and love.

0765334798|3.0|It's kind of a joke to fans of the Star Trek television program; being part of an away team was often very dangerous.  Especially to an extra wearing a red uniform.<br /><br />In this novel, the author explores the red shirt experience from the redshirts' point of view.<br /><br />The redshirts on the spaceship Intrepid have noticed that when certain senior officers lead away teams, a redshirt crewman often dies.  The redshirt who dies is usually new to the crew, has little backstory and often does not have first name.<br /><br />In an act of self-preservation, the veteran crew members hide when a senior officer is assembling an away team.<br /><br />Crew members have also noticed that senior officers act strangely when the ship in in a crisis situation.<br /><br />One of the redshirts reaches a remarkable conclusion: they are characters in a poorly written science fiction television program that is a rip-off of Star Trek.<br /><br />The red shirts decide that instead of waiting for their turn to die, they need to take control of the narrative of the program.  They do this by traveling in time back to present day Earth.  There they contact the actors who portrayed them, the producer of the show, and most importantly, the head writer.<br /><br />This is where Scalzi's narrative gets really strange.  For me, the actions and motivations of the characters, got really confusing.  In my opinion, Scalzi started with an interesting premise, and lost it in the last half of the story.  Scalzi does pull it together at the end for an interesting conclusion.<br /><br />Tacked on to the end of the novel are three short stories from the redshirt universe.  Here Scalzi explores the experiences that three\\"real people\\" had after interacting with the redshirts.  The first is written from the first person point of view, the second from second person, and third from third person.  These stories were interesting to read and gave the book a unique ending.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Scalzi, you'll want to read this book.  If you're new to Scalzi, read some of his better novels such as Old Man's War.  Come back to this book after you've read some of is best.alzi, you'll want to read this book.

B009NY43NY|1.0|Spoiler Disclaimer:  I will try to write this review with as few spoilers as possible however be aware that it is difficult to review a book without talking about the plot or characters.<br /><br />There are many troubling aspects in the writing of this book.  The most troubling of all is with the heroine, Sookie, herself.  Until Chapter 9 Sookie does not bear any resemblance to the Sookie in the previous 12 books.  She is extremely angry toward everyone, often snapping at people for no reason.  She is also profane in her thoughts and words to the extent that profanity appears at least once or twice on every page until Chapter 9.  Also, her mood is very dark, her thoughts are very dark and her whole outlook is very dismal.  But, perhaps the most jarring of differences is the bigotry of Sookie in this part of the book.  It is in stark contrast to the Sookie in the previous books who always defended the underdog who was suffering from some sort of prejudice.  She talks constantly throughout the book of how being a human is better.  It gets so bad that you expect to suddenly see a sign outside a store that reads, Vamps and Weres enter here.  All the while that she is saying and thinking these things, she forgets that she and Sam are supes themselves.  In one section she's telling how afraid she is of vampires and how awful they are for being killers, but in the next section she's talking blithely about Sam having the same propensity. She speculates that he could have killed Arlene and dumped her body, but probably didn't.  You get the feeling that she and Sam are \\"passing\\" for normal and like others who have hid their true selves in the past, they persecute those like themselves who are not \\"passing.\\"  It's very disturbing as the books are driven by the vampires \\"coming out.\\"  There are also sections where she is emotionally dead and they last for long periods.  She seems to be behind a grey veil.  For awhile I wondered if the CD had changed her as she speculated it had changed Sam, but she was back for awhile in Chapter 9, the same girl we always knew.  Her sudden shift from proclamations of love and incessant thoughts about one character then jumping in bed with another character about 10 days later are also out of character.  In previous books she always took much more time between relationships.  She indulges in some sex that can only be described as trailer trash, Jane Bodehouse-style, D-list porn.  Then she claims it is the best she ever had and that she may be with this character by Christmas...or maybe not.<br /><br />Frankly, all of this is just jarring and serves no purpose to the book at all.  The foul language and blatant discrimination are repulsive and also serve no purpose to the book.  There are many other ways this character could have been written and the plot driven in this book. Any good editor should have and would have caught this.  (This is a lesson in why you never employ friends or fans.)  The main character as a result becomes a complete failure in her last hoorah which is sad to say the least.<br /><br />The use of 3rd person omniscient is not used for any useful purpose here.  The prologue would have sufficed for the mystery.  After that it was unnecessary and was incredibly intrusive.  It felt like the author was saying, \\"Oh you didn't get it so let me hammer it into you.\\"  As if anyone who had read the books wouldn't recognize who was reading the bible or listening to his old sermons. (Not a spoiler as the prologue was published before.)  A better use of 3rd person would be to enter the minds of those other significant supporting characters who have been around for so long taking up much of the books.  She could have spent the time shedding light on their thoughts and motivations rather than shining light on an already obvious plotline.<br /><br />Last the entire book feels like it was put together with a shoe horn.  Different sub-plots seem completely unrelated and contrived to just get us to the end.  There is so much telling rather than showing that it is insulting.  By the end you will feel as if the author \\"schooled\\" you rather than showed you the story through Sookie's eyes.  There are blatant consistency errors.  A perfect example of this is when Sookie claims she cannot read supe minds.  She has read Eric and Alcide's minds very clearly.  She reads Sam's mind in the short story If I Had A Hammer which Harris herself says comes after the books.  This as so many other things is contrived blatantly to get her to an ending that she claims she wanted from book 2.  In all honesty the wind down of Sookie's previous relationship could have and should have been taken care of two books ago (one at the least).  It would have made sense then and left enough time to build to the second relationship.  Instead the second relationship is thrown on us out of the blue.  While the build up to Sookie's desire for normalcy and children was built over the last book and first third of this one, her feelings beyond friendship for the man in her next relationship are not.  As a result, this relationship seems very forced and unconvincing.  This will be a let down for any fans of that pairing.  There are still other blatant consistency errors that seem to be for the sake of shoving in the ending she wants, but they are just too numerous to mention.<br /><br />This book is an onerous snarl of a beast that offers no enjoyment.  Harris' Southern characters always reminded me a bit of Faulkner despite the fact that she lacked his writing skills.  After this book, I am left with a line Faulkner quotes in the beginning of The Sound and The Fury that describes Sookie's narration and her last tale precisely:<br /><br />it is a tale<br />Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />Signifying nothing. (Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act V, Scene v)

B009NY43NY|5.0|Sad that this is the last story in the Sookie Stackhouse universe, but what an excellent story to tie everything up!
B00AJER3SE|3.0|I saw this in the theater when it first came out and for the most part watching it again is fun.  The story holds together pretty well and for the most part the action and the actors are all good.  It is amazing to see the leap from this to T2 that Cameron made, both as a story teller and as a craftsman.  T2 is still superior but T1 is still worth owning.<br /><br />Where I have a problem is with the transfer.  It is possible that the original negative was dull and murky and that this Blu-Ray is an exact replica of that.  Orion was never known for lavishing money on their productions.  But I really did expect this Blu-Ray to be crisper and cleaner.  Not sure who to blame but I expected better.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|great full functioning easy to use. but I think it could use some improvements. But I can hardly complain for it's price. it deserves a 5 star because it was free. but I gave it 4 star because it could use some improvement.
B009NY43NY|4.0|(SPOILERS)<br /><br />I'm sad that people are giving this 1-star just because Sookie didn't end up with the person they wanted her to. It was always clear that Sookie was going to end up with a non-vampire, and specifically Sam. There was plenty of foreshadowing about how Sookie had a growing desire for children (which a vampire could never give her) and that she had a special fondness for Sam. I agree that: Eric's storyline is a depressing end for him, there are inconsistencies (throughout the whole series, though, not just this book--Harris made her mythology far too convoluted for no good reason), and that the stories have become rather formulaic. We can clearly expect that Sookie will get into trouble, finagle her way out of it, get hurt but survive, get a mysterious and unrealistic sum of money that will help her life immensely, and seem to be in the clear until she gets in trouble/hurt/still survives anyway.<br /><br />But the story is a fun, light, fast-paced read, which is all we should expect from a \\"Southern vampire novel.\\" I'm giving it 4-stars for being enjoyable and wrapping up enough of the series for us to trust that Sookie is going to have a happy life, secure in her house with Sam as her love and plenty of friends who clearly love her (Tara, Jason, Michelle). Is it perfect? Nope. But it's better than the last few books in the series were, and definitely worth reading.<br /><br />Besides... it's still better than Twilight. :)
B009T8XBBO|5.0|My Kingdom for the Princess is one of my favorite games. It works very well on my Kindle Fire HD 7. To get through the levels you have to strategically plan how to allocate your resources. I've been through the initial levels and now I'm stuck. I can't get through one of the levels fast enough to continue building the castle. But I'll keep trying. This game is challenging enough to keep it interesting. Nevosoft develops very clever games.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Having read all the others in this series, how did it end up back at square one. The heroine who has grown and found her place in the world ends up back where she started. The suitor that at every turn believed in her and encouraged such growth ends up to what amounts to as a sex slave. Nope not worth the time, money or energy to read. My advice stop at book nine, which is where the author should have stopped.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|A solid story in a well realized semi-apocalyptic future world.  This novel will make you consider what it means to be human, the value of empathy, life, death, and collective human endeavor.  Bladerunner may be a visually stunning (at least for 1982!) but the book far exceeds the movie in terms plot and depth.<br /><br />They are far less similar than I would have imagined.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have really enjoyed the Sookie books until these last two. I really like the author's style of writing. I know it is the author's choice where the storyline leads not the reader's choice. That is really the reason I haven't liked these last two books. I, the reader, wanted the story to take another route. Use the fairy wish to save Sookie's relationship with Eric.<br />Spoiler Alert!<br />I wanted Sookie to find her happily ever after with Eric. If not Eric, then Bill or John Quinn were tied for second choice in my mind. I kept waiting for Eric to come around and say he had worked it all out and didn't have to marry that vampire from Oklahoma and leave Sookie. I was even waiting for either Eric or Bill to turn Sookie and I thought there was going to be a real chance at that when she got shot. But no. I hoped when Quinn showed up to help and said his sister had gotten her life together and Tij didn't want him to be involved in her life even though there was a baby on the way meant that finally Sookie had a clear shot at a long term relationship with Quinn. But no. I did not see and certainly did not want Sam to be her next love interest. No. Just no. Ick no. He is her boss/partner and that on its own is just ick. I couldn't even read the sex scene because I was too repulsed that it involved him. Rebound sex with her boss at the end of the last book. Ick. Ick. Ick. The ending was a huge  let down to what had until recently been a great series. I am tempted to throw out the last two books and pretend they were never written. At least then I could pretend that Sookie worked things out with Eric and eventually became the next in his line of vampires and had her happily ever after. I wouldn't even have minded so much except this is supposed to be the last in the series and Sookie is still not yet a vampire nor yet with Eric, Bill, or Quinn and now there is nothing left to hope for as there aren't going to be any more books. It is just too disappointing to have it all end like this.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Vivid imagery, so if you are a circus lover who wants to have some idea of what it would be like to visit a magical victorian era circus, you may enjoy this.  However, you have to be fairly indifferent to plot or character development, areas in which this novel is sorely lacking.
1449437524|5.0|I preordered the book days ago. The book's content is almost the same as the one in oatmeal's website. But it's colored and there is one bonus page at the end of the book as well as a brief intro about the author, also it has a fancy hardcover.<br /><br />I feel both funny and sad at the same time, I can call this happiness. Totally worth it!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Even better than the first book.  Magical pseudoscience, a compelling protagonist and a wealth of imagery and detail.  If you liked The Name of the Wind, you'll love this.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Okay so I don't know why so many people are so mad at the end. It's the ending I always wanted for Sookie just at a much slower pace than I thought we'd see. Though I have to admit it makes sense in the long run after the things that Sook has been through.<br />I was super happy to get the chance to read even the smallest bit about everyone we missed so much. It was good to see some of Quinn, Amelia, Bob, Diantha and Mr. C... I won't drop the name of the surprise guest but I think y'all will love it as much as I did. Oh and Karin is freaking as awesome as Pam and I love them both!!!<br />The twists and turns are amazing and while a few may be predictable there was one that was just awesome and I did not expect it at all. I loved this book and can't wait for After Dead coming in Oct when we can see just how everything worked out for everyone

193700788X|5.0|Thank you Charlaine Harris for years and books with Sookie and her family and her friends.  You created something new and magical - and although it wasn't always perfect (frankly nothing I do is either), you gave me so many minutes of pleasurable reading.  My best days were spent like Sookie (but with sunscreen on) lying on my chaise in my backyard entering her/your universe and being transported away from my own problems.<br /><br />This book is true to the roots of the Sookie book-verse.  It reads to me very similarly in style and writing and content to books, say 1-5.  They had flaws sure, but I just think everyone loves to hate a winner, and the judgements put forth on this book are very different than someone would put on the exact same book if it were book three in a new series by a new author named Charlaine Harris.  Go reread book three and this book.  They have down-home Sookie caring about her friends and family, cooking and cleaning, worrying about money and the morality of her choices, thinking of romance and love, dealing with tough situations and most of all hoping to find her place in both her small-town universe and the supernatural one.  It's all still there.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />I think most of us cannot make enormous changes in our fundamental essential character just for love.  Change is hard and unlikely-even small changes. I adored the Eric Sookie romance, but it was clear that at her fundamental core, her life would be lacking happiness essentials she loved and needed (children, family, normal life) were she to end up with him.  It too was impossible to think after hundreds of years that the core of Eric would change so fundamentally for him to be happy living with limited power in a small town with an aging Sookie.  Maybe they could have adopted a child from China? ;) See a rational Eric/Sookie universe doesn't work.  We all knew that, even though Eric is one sexy beast!<br /><br />I don't have that life myself - being an urban liberal singleton.  But I grew up in a town like Sookie's, and yeah, I like to picture her growing older, surrounded by chubby babies, watching them grow up and then give her grandchildren.  I want to imagine her shopping at Walmart, making her tortilla casserole, fondly watching her husband eat it with vigor, admiring a sunrise with him, working in the garden with him, smiling at him over a funny line in  sermon at church.  Maybe Sookie turns into gran, guiding a struggly telepathic granddaughter through her tough teenage years.  I think of her as having supernatural mysteries and hardships, but instead of those being the center of her life - they are woven into her full tapestry.  Enjoy the sun surrounded by love, Sookie; you deserve it.  You are not perfect--none of us are--and your perpetual struggle with that is why I have felt so close to you for so many years.  I will miss you.<br /><br />I really wish to some extent that True Blood never came to exist.  I feel like it has brought in a loud whiny brutal unkind fan base who seem to have some view of Sookie that is not the Sookie of the books. I am almost glad Charlaine has ended the book series, because I can't deal with bitter irrational vitriol directed to her every attempt.  So many fans who claim to be lifelong fans of the book (which I don't really believe - I don't think all these one star reviewers bought these books and loved them before True Blood came out) have their heads and hearts ready to hate and have merged Sookie/Eric/Bill from the books with the characters on TV.<br /><br />I do honestly think a fan of an early book pre-True Blook-- and if this book were modified a tiny bit to temporally fit in---that person would have enjoyed this book greatly.  Charlaine's writing has never been about beautiful elegant prose.  It has been about slipping into the head and heart of a really smart, goodhearted but flawed, small-town supernatural waitress, solving some mysteries, and having a little bit of hot romance on the side. :)<br /><br />---<br />This romance in this is true to the Sookie of the book-universe.  She has had hot moments with Sam for a very long time.  Sure he was in \\"friend\\" role, but there was an underlying spicy hot occasional interactions to their friendship.  Eric is a vampire, a coldhearted selfish being - whom we all knew cared about Sookie more than he had ever cared about anyone.  I love Skarsgaard, but some on - there was no way to resolve a Sookie/Eric romance without her life being a unhappy mess.  She's Gran's granddaughter. She's want family and kids and church and community...and that was never going to happen with Eric.  Would Eric be happy with 60 year old Sookie?  Would Sookie be happy as a vampire?<br /><br />A possible resolution would have been a new person which would have been a bit lame and too fast, Sam, or magic turning Bill into a human.  Obviously, Eric was never going to be a final solution, Alcide had been written off, and Quinn \\"annoying babe\\" man was getting pushed further away.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I've had this book for awhile sitting on my kindle patiently waiting for me to open it up and I knew I would get around to it I just get sidetracked. I can say this is the next book I'm reading then bam my eyes find another book and this book was again left unread. I've heard nothing but great things about this book, everyone I talked to has said this book is great that Lake and Will are great, I haven't heard one bad thing about this book. Another thing you should know about me is that I love NetGallery if I see a book on it I get all excited and after I request it I check my emails all the time till I see if I was given the privilege to be given the book. So a few days ago I was given This Girl Slammed Book 3, sooooooooo I knew now was the time to start slammed and boy am I glad I did.<br /><br />  This book was great I read it so fast that I could not believe I was done when I finished this book. I was instantly attached to Will and Lake and sucked into their book. Not only did I love WIll and Lake and yes Will is swoon worthy (AHHH) but I loved everyone in this book The time that was taken writing the side characters is very obvious because they were so real and wonderful, this book made me cry it made me frustrated it made me happy and it made me so happy to have read it.  Even though some of Slammed was devastatingly sad I know that Colleen Hoover was true to these characters and that that is what had to happen in this story.<br /><br />  Lake's father died and with a one income home Lake her mother Julia and little brother Kel sell their home inTexas and move to Michigan. When Lake is pulling up to their new Home she see's Will and she is instantly attracted to him. After getting to know one another they agree to a date. On their date Lake knows right away that Will is different and that her feelings for him are more than she expected and planned for, and Will has a lot in common with her he has a little brother that he is raising because he lost both of his parents two years before so he can relate to her pain of loosing her father.<br /><br />  On Lakes' first day of school Lakes' world again turns upside down when she finds out that WIll is a teacher at her school and not only is he a teacher but WIll is her teacher. With no other choice WIll and Lake stop seeing each other but it is one of the hardest things either of them has ever done. and as time goes on it becomes clear that it will be a constant struggle. But Lake's life will again be turned upside down when she finds out that life will be dealing her another huge blow and in that mitts of her greatest pain Lake and WIll will have to decide if they will be able to ever find a way to be together.<br /><br />  Wow what can I say but that I loved this book it was so beautifully written, it was so heart breakingly beautiful. We not only get a wonderful love story but we get a story about a mother and daughter who have been dealt many blows and who love each other deeply. And we also get to see the love that Lake and her brother Kel have for one another and Will and his brother Caulder share and it's a love that every parent could only hope for. I Fell in love with Will and Lake and I fell in love with everything that was Slammed.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|Danger! Danger! Beware! Extremely addictive, proceed with caution!<br />I just finished watching the series' FINALE and am still crying. I've been streaming it from Season 1 to now, for most of this past week, even waking up at 3 AM to catch yet another episode. I stopped watching the news or anything else on 'normal' TV, neither did I have the mind to read a newspaper or magazine. Currently I have a pile of dishes in the sink, and I am successfully ignoring them :-).<br />LOST is a tour de force, a hefty mixture of sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, romance, suspense, and some (though not cloying) spirituality. While  not at all alike, its scope as well as the characters' interaction, reminded me of FRINGE. Yeah, I believe that both shows draw their strength from the way the protagonists react, interact, and eventually form loyalty to each other.<br />Do not expect the finale to wrap things up neatly. The main plot, over the course of six years, grew too many tentacles, off-shoots, nuances, and I suppose the finale was influenced by production limits. I feel I need another hour of storyline for many of the loopholes to close ...<br />In the final moments of the ending, I cried for Doc Jack, even though I never quite took a liking to him; to me, he is the spoiled golden boy who wasted too much of his life nurturing the chip on his shoulder. Yet he matured throughout the episodes and redeemed himself. On the other hand, John Locke is a character who distinguishes himself with faith and strength from the get-go, and I am left wondering why, in the FINALE, while liberated from his wheelchair, he was alone ... his lady love (Peggy! from Married with Children), who loved him no less than the other female heroines loved their beaus, was not by his side. Why? Could it be that John did not love her with the same intensity our dear dentist loved his wife Rose, or Jin loved his 'dream lady'?<br />One of the many loose ends at the finale, was Michael. True, he had done horrific acts to save his son, but then, later on, gallantly atoned for his sins. He deserved to be part of that last meeting.<br />Lastly ... I feel bad for the Black Smoke Monster. He had wanted to leave the island from the very beginning but was prevented by his step mom. Poor thing, he was born in captivity and after what must have felt like eons to him, perished in captivity. Despite the power he wielded, he was a victim, he sure had a right to the proverbial chip on the shoulder!<br />Oh, well. Off I go in search of tissues to wipe my tears and then tackle the dishes ...<br />LOST is a solid show. It's greatest flaw, is its capacity to get you addicted to watching it.o save his son, but then, later on, gallantly atoned for his sins. He deserved to be part of that last meeting.<br />Lastly ...

B001PTG4BO|3.0|There used to be a way of looking at the production of things. You would hone your craft in the hopes that a person who was really good at hawking well-honed crafts would agree to do that for you. This worked out great because you got to continue working on your craft, and you got the revenue from it (well, some of it, at least). The downside was that you had to rely on the advice of the hawker regarding what would sell. In effect, the hawkers - because they were a proxy for the customers - became the honers' only customer. What they felt they could sell became what could be sold. Let's call this the \\"agent-system\\".<br /><br />It replaced another system, in which you honed your craft in the hopes that an insanely rich person would see it and basically contract to buy everything you ever made ever again for ever and ever amen. The upside of this was steady income, and aside from the odd \\"Paint my son's dog's portrait\\" or \\"write a poem extolling my sister-in-law's beauty\\", pretty much artistic freedom (to read the rest of this review, please visit theagencyreview.wordpress.com/long-tail)

B009NY43NY|1.0|I started reading the Southern Vampire Mysteries about 10 years ago. I have waited every year for release day and then devoured the novel in one go.  I am a true fan.  I have felt the series going down hill for the past 3 or 4 books, but thought that possibly CH would really put an effort into the Final book of the series.  I am so disappointed!  We go out with a fizzle rather than a bang... and when people discuss an HEA - there is none.  Sookie doesn't get an HEA and really no one does.  It's so upsetting to have stuck by what used to be one of my favorite series ever, to have the author annihilate what are some of the best loved characters I have read.  CH has an apparent dislike of her characters and if that has been the case for quite some time, I can only surmise she has been only doing this for money and to further the popularity of True Blood of which she also makes money (she decided not to kill Bill - lol - because it could hurt the TB franchilse). CH has said that she knew the way she wanted this series to end by book 2!  If that is the case, then why was there really no build up of that relationship for ALL THESE YEARS! Why decide to assassinate Eric's character just to have them break up?  Eric was the one who has killed for Sookie, protected Sookie, spoiled Sookie, taken care of Sookie, fought beside Sookie, healed Sookie... I could go on.  To have him become some whimpy boy who has no choice but to go with the powerful Queen of OK because his dead abusive master put it in a contract is ludicrous.  He has been a warring Viking for 1000 years! and just to keep all those at bay who would say I am only an Eric lover, that's not true.  I do love Eric the Viking Vampire I read that was authored by CH! The one who has been Sookie's suitor, and I cannot get over her hopping into bed with her brotherly boss/friend. She has effectively assassinated the character of our favorite telepath - SOOKIE HERSELF.  She didn't really grow, or transform into a more maturewoman after all this time, she has simply become jaded and resigned.  And in this particular subpar effort, even came across as what she has always despised - a simple minded bigot. She disposed of Eric and Sooke in less than 10 pages.  She gave way more time to Alcee Beck who I couldn't give a fig about.  We barely see Pam (my favorite character, and a REAL friend to Sookie), who I have always loved more than anyone else - It was disgusting really.  I completely agree with any who would say that CH can write whatever she wants as she is the GOD of her own Bon Temps Universe, and this time I stuck around to see it through to the end.  However, I myself will absolutely NEVER buy another thing written by CH because I do not want to risk knowing I could be a decade in with the new series, for her to end up tired of her characters and just decide to crap all over them AGAIN!

B00AF82WTO|3.0|I'm a romantic and love the story of Persuasion.  Have studied the book and written reports for school on it. I have seen several versions of the story with my favorite one starring Amanda Root.  This most recent version in no way compares to the earlier one. Yes, the actors may be better looking but that's about it for the positives.  It doesn't develop the story.  It changes the ending in several ways.  I understand that this is often done to make the story more exciting - this however did not accomplish this - it just was ridiculous!  UPDATE: I must comment on the positives of this version to be fair: I love the way the main character has several scenes throughout the movie where she is alone and looking directly at the camera and displays several different emotions depending on the scene - great effect.  Also I really enjoyed both actresses portrayal of Anne and her sister Mary in BOTH this version and the Amanda Root version.

1455869910|5.0|I was skeptical about reading this novel, because generally I find it hard to relate to 'teenager' books. Firstly, this is not a 'teen' book, although it is good for teenagers/young adults to read as well. I decided to read it because I loved the title. It is inspired by Shakespeare's words in Julius-Cesar (acknowledged by the author),\\"The fault, dear Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\\" It is a beautifully written story of a seventeen year old girl Hazel, battling cancer.  The strength of this novel lies not only in the author's capability of instilling life into his characters, but also creating happiness despite the pathos that underlies the plot. As an oncologist, I also applaud John Green's deep understanding of the many levels of pain that cancer brings, and the different kinds of strength we surprisingly find in its victims. This book made me laugh, made me cry, kept me awake. It was light and easy to read while being deeply philosophical about life, death and love.<br />My favorite quotes are:<br />About love,\\"As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at once.\\"<br /><br />About cancer:\\"My dad understood my cancer the way I did: in the vague and incomplete way people understand electrical circuits and ocean tides. But my mom knew more about differentiated thyroid carcinoma in adolescents than most oncologists.\\"<br /><br />(Edited to avoid spoilers)\\"Some war. What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me....It is a civil war..with a predetermined winner.\\"<br /><br />\\"Even cancer isn't a bad guy, really. Cancer is just trying to stay alive.\\"<br /><br />About loss,\\"Grief doesn't change you. It reveals you.\\"<br /><br />The acclaim this book has won is well-deserved.

B009NY43NY|4.0|What is wrong with you people!  Eric was never a good guy.  I never liked him with Sookie, and it was obvious from the beginning that this relationship was doomed. You could see early on that Sookie would want a family which she couldn't get with a vampire.  Eric was always out for his own best interests so why is everyone so shocked?  I wanted her to dump his behind 3 books ago.  I admit, I was a bit surprised about the Sam story line, but am okay with it.  I like where Sookie ended up in her life, and I liked this book.  Read it and form your own opinion.  Don't let all this negativity keep you from closing out the series.

B009NY43NY|3.0|After reading many reviews I was prepared to expect the worst from the series ender.  Reports of \\"worst book ever\\" have been somewhat exaggerated.  I understand where all the frustration stems from and there are definite problems with the book, but I think a lot of what has people so very upset is (spoilerish) that their 'ship didn't come in.  I had suspected Sookie would end up with...who she ends up with for the last 5 books.  The author had been pushing Eric away for many books, this shouldn't have been the bomb that it has been.  I don't think her HEA is the worst choice or the best but its done.  And it wasn't done terribly.  That said...holy continuity errors Batman.  There's loads of them.  Its frustrating to be a fan that pays so much attention to the details that an author creates only to have said author dismiss them.  Character developments for the last 12 books are thrown to the wind in some cases and that is frustrating also.  But if you love the series (I do/did) and you are willing to overlook them (I tried very hard) than its not a bad read.  These are fun books.  CH ties up some ends nicely.  It feels like a series ender, because it is.  Should CH have quit about 4 books ago?  I think so.  DId she get greedy?  maybe.  But it was her series to create and ultimately end as she saw fit.  Could it have been better? sure.  She herself has stated she got bored and it shows.  And I've always felt like she didn't appreciate her fans having an opinion on what she wrote.  But thats kind of what fans do, so what can you do?  Read the book, enjoy it for the sake of the series you came to love and accept that is a middling book about a character we loved. The end...or at least until True Blood comes back on this summer and we can focus our attentions on a sexier Sookie and her antics.
193700788X|1.0|What an awful and disappointing final book for such a good serie. It is not about who Sookie chose to be with. Not entirely anyway. It is the way she got there. This book has too many inconsistencies and contradictions from great many things we learned in previous books. CH should have used more post it notes because she apparently forgot what she wrote before. That or she stop caring about what she was writing.<br /><br />One of the things that bothered me the most was Sookie suddenly jumping to bed with Sam (and the following &#34;seal sex&#34; was kind of off putting). I really would like to know just when Sookie developed her these romantic feelings towards Sam? She fought viciously against the bond but she is ok with the CD changing her feelings? Really? I felt like I was reading a completly different Sookie from the one I got to know in previous books.<br /><br />I understand that the autor was tired of this series (she said that time and time again) so why not stop writing before and leave the series at a higher and better point? I guess the answer is simple. It all comes down to money. CH wrote what we wanted to read. We came to love Eric because he always was there for Sookie in the books. She spent at least 8 books developing their relationship just to throw it in the garbage at the very last minute and in the worst possible way. Ultimately II think our money is good for CH but our opinion is not and she couldn't even be bothered to write a decent book. I guess that is good to know. At least we know what to expect from her now. Personally I'm done with her. No more CH books for me ever.<br /><br />This book is not really worthy the time and money it takes to read it.

B009NY43NY|3.0|Didn't love it, but I liked it. I thought the last third of the book was weak, but overall it wasn't bad. I'd have preferred a different ending for Eric, but he's not my character. I like TB Eric better than book Eric anyway...I liked the overall show of support Sookie got in the end from everyone - after feeling so isolated her whole life it was nice to see. Sam was believable, but it could have been written differently I think. 3 stars where I gave the other 12 books 4-5

B00CLH1PHM|5.0|Despite a couple of American grammar missteps (and who doesn't have those), this story was engaging and well written.  This was a great introduction to Whitehead's style for reading his highly-rated book, \\"The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club\\" - which I have waiting at my desk, beckoning - and a wonderful stand-alone story with an ironic twist.

193700788X|1.0|To start: I was never a massive fan.  I didn't have a favorite suitor.  I just enjoyed the books when I found out there was a new one. I found the one right before this about a month ago and then saw Dead Ever After was the final book and due out in a month and actually got EXCITED even though the previous book was a bit tedious and the characters a bit \\"Twilight\\"-esque in action and thought for me.<br /><br />The story feels rushed, stale, and put together of bits and pieces that might have hit the writers brain at 4am.  Nothing is fleshed out enough to feel like a real plot here, and the \\"happily ever after\\" is rushed and unconvincing.  Even Sookie says she thinks they might be together later. THINKS.  This is no happily ever after, and since it's a brand new romance the rush-job is incredible.<br /><br />The author seems to be backtracking on things that even I know she's said would be troublesome in other books, and I'm by far not the most intensive of readers.  Mind reading (and how clearly she can read weres) , safety (because we can always trust the word of a vampire, right? ), children (because Sookie is clearly comfortable with Hunter and his situation.. right? ) and on and on.<br /><br />Sookie feels annoyingly whiny and obtuse here, and the \\"happily ever after\\" feels like a fill in the blank.. any male in the story would have worked.  Why not Hoyt if he were single?<br /><br />Most depressing are the overall themes.  Sookie has suffered much to gain nothing but confidence, I mean.. don't get me wrong confidence is awesome.  But the price of rape and torture seem a little high for just that.  She's in the same job, same town, same people who think she's nothing but a crazy girl, same friends as all the supes seem mostly absent now, and with a man who has never fought for her or shown her passion.  Wow, inspiring.<br /><br />It just feels like the author wants you to know that no matter how hard you fight it you're destined to keep living the same life.  The vampires are still subservient to their higher masters, slaves actually. Sookie is still in the same town being treated like a pariah.<br /><br />This isn't \\"the best book\\" the author could write.  It's a gunshot to the temple of a series Ms. Harris is tired of dealing with. Ms. Harris has euthanized this series so that people will leave her alone about it.<br /><br />Depressing.<br /><br />EDIT: Nope still peeved.<br /><br />1- Seriously, Claude?  Really?<br />2- Is Sookie's vajayjay so magical that the openly flamboyantly gay faerie needs a piece, and will torture her for not having given it to him?<br />3- Really?  That's how she gets un-kidnapped?  ...No, REALLY?<br />4- HYPNO VOICE ...BALLS.  Seeeeeeeeeeeeeriously?<br /><br />1- Wait, that's THE scene for her and her HEA?  The one and only?  It's.. a paragraph long.<br />2- Can't she just dump them all and be happily alone and strong?<br />3- So she's \\"safe\\" from the vampires.  Except for all the other kingdoms, or other possessive vamps.  Or the other supes she's gotten after her tail.  Maybe she'll only be kidnapped in front of bars from now on so the humans can save her.<br />4- If she wasn't safe this whole time, what makes her safe now?<br /><br />1- Why does this read like fanfic?<br />2- What?<br />3- As much as I love Mr. C and Dianthus.. enough already.  I would like more plot.<br />4- More plot please. Dinner is not plot.  Unless someone kidnaps her during dinner. Or dies. Or explodes.  Or poison.  You get it.<br /><br />1- Bill stays, Eric goes, Author doesn't see where being enslaved for 200 years and forced to \\"service\\" owner is wrong.<br />2- Townspeople are really supposed to keep loving her?  They've thought she was nuts for 12 books...<br />3- Hey thanks for the Miracle-gro Niall! Saved Sookie a trip to the store.<br />4- DON'T CONTROL ME! I can't know if I love you if you're influencing me!!<br />  **Exception for rare faerie artifacts that aren't supposed to exist.  Those are A-OK.<br />5-Well bye then vampires! You were only the plot for 12 books and have like.. 5 pages in the last. Plot plot.<br />6- Really? Because he's gay?
B009NY43NY|5.0|Everyone who is upset about the ending are mad about losing their hot forbidden vampire fantasy.  I was never a fan of Sam but he was exactly what Sookie needed. All this moaning about the author not loving her characters they way her fans did is absolutely childish.  Sookie is the character, the series is about HER! None of the vampire characters were ever able to put Sookie first, they used and abused her. Sure the vamps were hot, but they were never good long term relationship material. Sookie has always struggled with the person she was around them.  The author gave her main character the ending she needed and that was the correct way to end the series.  Those of you who feel so betrayed by Sookie getting the life she needed can find a new super dirty fix in the always pro vampire way over the line Anita Blake novels.
B002OR0RP0|4.0|We love the little squirrel after the acorn.  This was a good family movie.  Video quality on Prime is very good.
193700788X|1.0|Well well well Ms Harris what an abomination ( As Rev Newlin would say). This series has sunk to a new low. So little thought went into the final book of this series. Story lines did not make sense!  The assassination of Eric's character in which he went from a sexy strong fire cracker to a mere puppet of the Kings was terrible. We had spent 6 books watching the Eric/Sookie relationship and he literally said See you later and walked out the door??? The people who wanted to kill Sookie didn't even have a legit reason ?????? Sookie suddenly loving Sam???? I could go on and on....<br />Okay okay it is not just the story line but the writing... My 3 year old uses more complex adjectives.. \\"the tall man\\" \\" the medium man\\" come on. Perhaps CH could purchase herself a thesaurus with the money she made from me.<br />Lucky the writers of True Blood have made up for Harris' poor performance. Looking forward to June when the series starts again and removes the poor taste in my mouth

B00479SVBU|4.0|I got this about a year ago and absolutely  love it. It works very well.<br /><br />I have given 4 stars because of a few minor issues.<br /><br />- Shuffle tends to repeat tracks. It just keeps going back to the same ones again and again. I do not use that feature anymore. I just let it play in normal mode and skip to the next track if needed.<br /><br />- It does not remember where you left off. So when you turn on your car, the whole songs repeats itself.

B003BWERF8|5.0|So I was looking for a BT transmitter to connect my iPod classic with my factory radio and came across this one.  It didn't take me long to decide on the Kokkia based on other's reviews.  It paired flawlessly with my 2011 Jeep Liberty radio.  No crackling during play and works as you'd hope it to.  The size, or lack there of is impressive.  Say buh-bye to the cables.  Highly recommended.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|I disagree just a bit with many of the other reviewers here. I understand what they (and Rory himself) meant when they say the studio tracks sound flat.  I am probably reading too much into it but in his voice mainly it sounds to me obvious that Rory wasn't enjoying these sessions. And there is absolutely no disagreement from me that by far the versions of these songs on the album Photo Finish are infinitely the better ones. But for me Rory was such an amazing artist that the alternate versions are great to hear. And once I forget how much I like the Photo Finish versions most of the  ones here really work as well. They are much more produced then anything else Rory ever did and my guess is that is one of the main reasons he rejected them, he just didn't want that typical highly produced pop sound. But what can I say, I'm not such a purist. I can really enjoy rich production  if its done well and this is. And its really cool to hear what Rory sounds like with a bit more polish then he normally has on the production and with a few extra musicians. Even though I think Rory made the right decision to go back down to a trio I also think Lou Martin was an excellent keyboardist and his work especially really shines on some of these songs. I also really like Rod de'Ath's drumming on these songs. So if you haven't already purchased all of Rory's non-posthumous albums (and if so what are you waiting for?) then don't buy this until you've purchased Photo Finish. But for Rory  fans like me who are fans in the fanatic sense of the word this album is awesome.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is a long and wandering book which takes you to a lot of unexpected places.  I read the last half in a very long sitting. It's that kind of story. Gaiman drags you in slowly then he has you and won't let go.  I found it profoundly moving and uplifting. I won't try to tell the story. You can read others for that. But the book will pick you up and carry you with it. Buy it. It's awesome.

B0018BTM8G|5.0|This is a review of the vinyl box set which was released in Japan.  Just as with the CD box set there are 19 singles included.  There are some major differences though.  The vinyl singles include all of the B-sides as originally released.  Additionally, the singles for Know Your Rights, Rock The Casbah and Straight To Hell include the sticker inserts originally released with those records  And the single for This Is England is wrapped in a fold-out poster.<br /><br />Other additions include a second booklet with a foreword written in Japanese followed by a Japanese translation of the artist and celebrity recollections of various singles from the CD booklet.  The translation is followed by lyrics (English and Japanese) to all of the songs included on the singles.  Just to reiterate this set comes with two booklets; the one included with the CD box set and one containing lyrics for all of the songs.  Both booklets are sized to match the 7-inch singles.<br /><br />The final difference is the inclusion of lyric inserts to nine singles:<br /><br />I Fought The Law/White Man In Hammersmith Palais<br />London Calling/Armagideon Time<br />Bankrobber/Rockers Galore<br />The Call Up/Stop The World<br />This Is Radio Clash/Radio Clash<br />Know Your Rights/First Night Back In London<br />Rock The Casbah/Mustapha Dance<br />Should I Stay Or Should I Go/Cool Confusion<br />This Is England/Do It Now<br /><br />I referred to them as lyric inserts but that's not accurate since they are the same size as the singles and wouldn't fit in a record sleeve.  Perhaps they are a reproduction of the singles originally released in Japan.  With the exception of Bankrobber they feature artwork on the front with some combination of Japanese and English text/lettering.  And the back includes the lyrics in Japanese and English.  The actual picture sleeve for Bankrobber was included along with a one-sided lyric sheet.  This is in addition to the picture sleeve containing the Bankrobber single.<br /><br />I think that covers everything.  If I ever get enough time, I'll upload pictures or scans of some of the lyric and sticker inserts.  I don't normally write reviews, but I couldn't find one on the vinyl box set.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|This isnt normally my style of book. We have a silo on our property so I was intrigued.  I was honestly expecting to read a few pages and pass off the book to my teenage son but I was quickly drawn into the story line. I love that I couldnt predict what was coming next and my mind was easily envisioning what the author was selling.  My only disappointment is I would have liked to have had the characters (Juliette) have thr ability to explore more of the destroyed world.......what if there were somehow survivors, what if the air wasnt really poisoned but instead the air in the suits was deliberately poisoned to kill the cleaners, what if the Silo's were someones twisted human experiment??  The possibilities are endless.  Great read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. The characters felt authentic, albeit a bit smarter and wittier than the average teenager. I passed it on to my 12 year old daughter and she loved it too. I highly recommend it.

193700788X|2.0|6/8/13<br />Now that I'm over the initial shock of what a poor finale this novel was for a great group of characters and several excellent installments, I've lowered my rating again to 2 stars. The novel showed up, told a story that kind of fits and got things over with and that's about it.<br /><br />I've loved and reread this series many times. Knowing that this is where it a leads makes it unlikely for me to revisit them again which is a crying shame.<br /><br />5/10/13<br />After thinking more about the book, I'm back to add some comments to my review and lower the rating from 4 to 3 stars. I keep thinking, yes, Charlaine did tie everything up, but when I think back on the brilliance of her best series work -- Sookie, Harper and Lily -- I just can't understand why this book has only a matte finish, only just enough, not even close to what she is capable of doing.<br /><br />I would rather have Sookie end up brave and alone without the hint of a man in her future than with the so so maybe connection with Sam, who is in fact a great guy and worthy of a much more developed connection with Sookie.<br /><br />Still can't get over how Eric was handled either. The fact that he was willing to double his \\"time\\" as consort to the queen of Oklahoma to ensure Sookie's safety is brushed off as just a show to the other vampires just isn't convincing. Can't help but think that we are expected and should read more into this sacrifice, and for a guy who likes to call the shots, this is a sacrifice. Just can't buy that adding another 100 years as consort to protect Sookie is just a show.<br /><br />Also agree with other folks that it was an unfortunate mistake to add 3rd person narrative after 12 books of first person. Unnecessary and not helpful.<br /><br />5/8/13<br />Well, I read the last chapter first. Had to know who Sookie ended up with so that I could adjust to the outcome before I traveled there. Although I kept hoping that Charlaine would pull a rabbit out of the hat andcome up with a way for Sookie and Eric to end up together, I knew chances were pretty slim and, alas, no bunnies jumping out of hats. (Was great to have Pam remain, that was my consolation with Eric leaving.)<br /><br />Where Sookie ends up at the end of the book is logical and I enjoyed her journey so much that I was up until 3:30 am traveling there with her. Loved that in the end, she is so confident in herself that she knows, which ever direction her life leads, she will be fine because she is Sookie Stackhouse.<br /><br />I saw nothing out of character for Sam and Sookie to be starting a relationship. Sam had a real come to Jesus by dying, that's the sort of thing that certainly makes you reflect on past choices and focus on making better future choices. Sookie has always respected, admired and cared for Sam, so her move -- slowly -- in his direction makes sense.<br /><br />Loved all the characters coming together in this last blast (although I was hoping Niall would make an appearance other than in a letter blooming from a rose bush.) Was happy to see almost everyone getting their just desserts.<br /><br />I have loved this series from the beginning, even when some installments were less than shiney. Although not the ending I had hoped for, it was well thought out, tied up lots of loose ends and very satisfying.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|This movie was awful - sick, disturbing and boring.  I don't even know what to say to people who liked it - I am worried for them.

193700788X|2.0|So I'm not sure how to write this review. Like most fans of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse/Southern Vampire Mysteries/True Blood books, I was sad to find out that the most recent book, Dead Ever After, would be the last in the series but also like most fans of the books, I was pretty sure it was also time to wrap up the series because the last few books have really been disappointing and unfortunately, this one follows suit as well. The first 3/4 of the book was totally boring. It basically was chalk full of the daily goings on of Miss Stackhouse. The only bright spots were the numerous cameo appearances from all of your favorite characters from all the previous books. I honestly don't think anyone was left out. It almost felt as though Charlaine went down the character list and wrote every single one in to say goodbye. This day in and day out stuff continues until she is unjustly arrested for a murder. Then you see all the core characters come together to show their support for Sookie. In the meantime, Eric is brushed away and his story is wrapped up as well, all to make room for Sam to court Sookie. Just so we're clear, I've always been on Team Bill and always will be but with my personal opinions aside, I am not sure how I feel about the Sam/Sookie pairing. All through the books, except for the first one, Sam has always been her rock but always a friend and (for me) there has never been any sort of heat or passion between them. I know in the first couple books, Sam made some noise about wanting her and then he kissed her but Sookie always made it clear that there was nothing besides friendship between them. I kinda feel like Charlaine knew that she needed to give Sookie a HEA with one of the many men that have come into her life and Sam seemed to be the safest choice without pissing off too many fans. I guess, the series just lost its sparkle after about the 5th book and this was just the book to finish off the dying horse. There is a little surprise actionat the end but honestly, for being the last in the series, I expected a lot more but I guess after this book, I'm glad it's over.

As mentioned before, it lacks many features available at the website. In addition, it will not show less popular channels, so it's functionality does not exist for me.

1616550414|4.0|I love learning about the world of Zelda and any information there is to know about its history. In this book, the timeline of all the games is finally revealed. This is a must have for all Zelda owners. However, the timeline is well known at this point and is pretty much everywhere online. It's really not an issue anymore, so you have to debate whether it's really worth it to own a hard copy of the history or not.

0345534379|2.0|The only reason I have it 2 stars is because of the size of the book. It's the size of your typical novel, that sucks. Makes it hard for a couple people to look at at the same time. Plus makes the pictures and the words hard to see and read. No I don't have eye sight problems. But when it's an award winning picture I want to see it in clear detail and color would have been nice. Most pictures are in black and white, cheaply done and made. Get the hard back print that is bigger and in color.
193700788X|2.0|I was very disappointed in this final book.  The characters were very one-dimensional and it seemed that some characters were brought back into the story for no reason other than the author felt obligated to mention them again.  This book could have been condensed very easily into novella and it certainly was not worth the high price tag.  Readers of the series would be better off ending the story in book 12 and using their imagination to end the story themselves.  I was pressed to give it 2 stars and only did so out of respect for the first 12 books.  Not bringing the story of Eric and Sookie to better close (at least have more interaction between them) was very disappointing.  Having to do it over again, I would NOT buy this book.  Sorry Ms. Harris, you could have done it better.

0393343405|5.0|but hardly a demonstration of the subtitle: How the World BECAME MODERN.  Reading of one of the heroes Poggio's (the other Lucretius) life in the midst of both a very decadent Church and similarly decadent times gives fuel to an understanding of the Reformation.  If Poggio's reputed mistress and 12 children, whom he abandoned when he married in late middle age, were not just the typical calumnies that he and others hurled at each other, then despite his interest in recovering old manuscripts, he and his cohort were not very nice people. A time of false popes, corrupt curial politics, arrogance, use of theology for power, how is it possible to assert that his discovery of De Rerum Natura, about which he seemingly held no opinion was the fulcrum on which the world tipped toward becoming \\"modern?\\"  Based on anything the scientific revolution would call evidence, Lucretius' assertion of atomism is as speculative as a flat earth, god's creation in 6 days, the virgin birth and the triune god.  The Swerve does not fit with observations of the universe by any thinker relying on physical evidence since Ptolemy.<br /><br /> The author's list of Lucretius' modern claims is indeed impressive. It not only anticipates cosmological refutations of an anthropic universe but touches on Darwinism and even the Buddhist idea of emptiness.  But none of that is what Lucretius meant.  His context had few of the ideas of later science.  His Epicureanism could not conceive of endorphins shared both by humans and other animals.  He concepts, as the author points out, were \\"essentially erotic\\".  So while his words sound modern it is hard to say how they connect to the science that emerged after him and began to change the way the physical world is understood.  Copernicus, Galileo and finally Newton could be Christians and yet base their novel ideas, not on the particularly untestable idea of atoms, but on replicable observations. Newton's particles fit with his observations of mass and light.  They were not snatched out of philosophic speculation.  In John Heilbron's biography of Galileo Lucretius is not mentioned and atomism only four times, one of which was as an accusation by his prosecutors.  The Reformation turned the Inquisition into a paranoid, bloody  McCarthyism which blew even the slightest offense way out of proportion.  Atomism was hardly the greatest of sins.  And, as the author points out, Luther, Calvin and their ilk were no less zealous of Christian doctrine.<br /><br />My sense of the tipping point of the modern world lay not in humanist reorientation of speculative thinking but in the accumulation of practical knowledge from what we might call engineering problems.  This built slowly and out of sight of theologians and essay writers. Artillery, mining, architecture, alchemy, astrology/astronomy, navigation and the calendar, etc.  Poggio just missed da Vince but what inspired the latter must have been rife in Poggio's world.  Despite Poggio's discovery, he set no precedents for what was to come.<br /><br />Besides the possible inaccuracy of the book's claim, it is none the less a great picture of Poggio's world.  Poggio and his peers acerbic dialogues with some interlocutors taking positions contradicting established doctrine was what got Galileo in so much trouble.  Because the Inquisition did not yet have Protestants to battle, Poggio's generation got away with titling swords at doctrine. By the time of Giordano Bruno and Galileo such provocation could prove deadly.<br /><br />Poggio's antiquarianism, his essays, the politics of religion etc. leave us with an interesting picture of a form of life, which despite its plagues and petty intrigues, may not be much different than our own.  We get outraged by a blow-job in the Oval office.  Creationists abhor Darwinism.  The titillating descriptions of passion by Lucretius, Poggio and others don't hold a candle to internet pornography.  And it is interesting to try to separate out the obsession with sex from the Epicurean idea of moderation.  People still argue about god and purposeless materialism.  Not much new, but the author's presentation of an incarnation four or five hundred years old made for fascinating reading. When I told my brother-in-law that I was bored with reading he suggested this book.  He was right. It is very interesting. Its author, I assume, a humanist, exercised that wonderful perspective on the world.<br /><br />Charlie Fisher, author of \\"Dismantling Discontent: Buddha's Way Through Darwin's World\\" and the forthcoming \\"Meditation in the Wild: Buddhism's Origin in the Heart of Nature.\\"on with sex from the Epicurean idea of moderation.

Even a baby boomer music lover such as myself can relate to this great collection of thoughtful and moving songs. As a singer and guitarist, I am all ready trying to cover the haunting &#34;Little Bit of Everything.&#34; I love this album.

I haven't gotten to watch it yet but hope to borrow it or watch it with them during a visit.

B002ZG974M|3.0|Would have held interest more had it focused only on one baby, such as the infant boy from Mongolia.<br />The San Fran infant girl was a bland documentation of her first year.<br />Concept of contrasting the first year of babies from around the globe with such cultural diversity I liked.<br />The best part of the documentary was how each baby was truly loved and how that love was expressed.

0575096624|1.0|Dead Ever After... Such a shame that after all the years of building up characters, sharing fabulous plot lines and opening up so many exciting possibilities for Sookie and co, CH chose to \\"end\\" their respective plotlines in such a flat, uninspired and poor manner - not to speak of the clear and utter lack of convinction.<br /><br />Yes, I am an Eric fan, however expected a fulfulling end to Sookie's saga not an cop out! There could have been many plausable endings, consistent with the characters whilst offering a decent and exciting but happy ending for the last book.<br /><br />I was so excited, I pre-ordered the book - read it in one go and was utterly shocked after reading it.  All in all I felt robbed.  Alas, I was not alone which offers some comfort.  Never before have I ever posted anything on-line however so deeply disapointed am I, that I just had to share my point of view.<br /><br />If you can don't bother buying it - you're better off using your imagination and creating your own end to the story.  Truth be told, there's more than enough scope for a redemption book to be written and hopefully that happens.  The characters and fans deserve much more than this extremely poorly presented attempt of a final hoorah.  Some conviction, passion and true happiness would go a long way.<br /><br />Not at all impressed.

B00947N6D8|5.0|This movie addresses the wonders of belief systems in the magical and mystical with a hint towards preservation of our inner child for the purpose of hope and joy.  Even the mythical can be very real to us if we embrace the positive aspects of working together for the common good and coming to new understanding of just who we are, even if we may have forgotten.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I just finished the book, and I'm thinking really is this the Author's idea for ending the series? I'm totally disappointed with this book, but more importanly I'm completely disillusioned with the author. my advise to Charlene Harris is: please do not Ever, Ever after this book write about the series again. the book titles describes how I, and I'm sure other fans feel about your writing \\"Dead Ever After\\". It is obvious that your heart/energy/time was not into writing this book. I wasted my money and more importanly my time for a book that left me completely disapointed.
B007SGM084|5.0|Whenever my boyfriend sees me reading he always says, &#34;there you are reading your porn!&#34; And thats very much what these books are. They have a very good story line that keeps you hanging on, and several, several, hot, detailed sex scenes. Read them!
B003TJR2HS|1.0|This adapter did last some what longer then the cable adapter that I purchased, but while the time from purchase was longer it did not have a lot of usage, as I only used it occasionally, when circumstances dictated the need.  In this case not more then 20 times for total of 3-5 hours of usage before failure. I do not usually write negative reviews, I just don't repurchase a product. In this case the product was of such inferior quantity. That I felt the need to warn new purchasers. Do not buy this (for lack of a better term) JUNK.

B003XRELEI|3.0|There were so many things I liked about this book early on. I laughed out loud. I loved the analogies. I pondered meanings of life and modern society. I was hooked. But I detached from the book and characters toward the end. The climax seemed anti-climatic. I liked it, but didn't love it. Read it because it's Vonnegut, but I found it middle if the road overall.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|I enjoy different genres of movies, though of course I love Star Trek. This however, is unwatchable for far too many reasons to list here. Let's try, the acting overall with few exceptions; Leonard Nimoy,Karl Urban, Simon Pegg are horrible. It was tedious watching Pine act as a petulant boy, Shatner was himself as Kirk, Pine tries to be Shatner acting as Kirk, Chekov is unbearable just mute him when you can.<br /> The lighting or whatever he calls it is quite annoying. There's no real story, Star Trek aside it's a ridiculous idea. It's made for low thinking people who enjoy noise more than substance. For all the rave reviews, remember \\"reality Shows\\" rule the airwaves.<br /> Stay away & if you loved this 'movie' please use birth control.

This album contains his best known song Sugarman as well as Crucify Your Mind, This Is Not A Song, It's An Outburst: Or, The Establishment Blues, Hate Street Dialogue, Forget It, Inner City Blues, I Wonder, Gommorah and Rich Folks Hoax. This is an amazing work of art and a fine addition to any music collection. Of you're ever able to catch Rodriguez in concert, he puts on a damn fine show too.

This album has many great tracks: Climb Up On My Music, A Most Disgusting Song, I Think of You, Cause, Can't Get Away and I'll Slip Away are my favorites off this album. But you cannot have this album without Cold Fact. But them both, you will not be disappointed.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have been a devoted Sookie reader for so long. I have eagerly awaited the new book each year and have  re-read the series several times.<br /><br />That being said, I am always so shocked when authors screw up their continuity. Do they think no one will notice?!?! I am just a reader of this series and I picked up on these issues very easily. I would think if I had written this series I would know it even better.<br /><br />Has Sookie's telepathy not been exploited in numerous ways to suit the Were population??? But now she can only pick up on emotions from them?? This boggles my mind. It feels forced and &#34;patched&#34; up just so Sookie can end up with Sam.<br /><br />I have always been Team Eric and I hated his ending 100%. He deserved better. I was less angry with the Sam ending than I thought I would be. I think I might could have even believed the Sam ending if the romance had been building instead of just thrown on us at the last minute.<br /><br />I don't feel like I got closure for any beloved character in this series. Not even Quinn. He had to take off because his boss was going to fire him?? I thought he was the boss?!?!<br /><br />I have to wonder if this ending left us all wondering &#34;what just happened&#34; so we would all buy this next companion book.<br /><br />I will always love books 1-8!!
0062059963|5.0|Only six girls remain in the Selection. When it ends, one of them will have won the Prince's hand and the crown. America Singer has made it this far but in spite of Maxon's assurances that she's the one as far as he's concerned, America is uncertain. Uncertain of her feelings for Maxon and whether she truly wants to be with him, uncertain where she stands with him, and uncertain whether she can handle the throne when and if the time comes. As the competition becomes more serious America becomes even more confused. And what about Aspen, her childhood sweetheart and now a member of the royal guard?<br /><br />I truly enjoyed Kiera Cass's THE SELECTION, and especially loved returning to the series with THE ELITE. It's just so much fun!<br /><br />In this second of the trilogy, we do get a bit more information about Illea and its history, why things are the way they are and how they came to be that way. Maxon shows America a secret room in the palace that's filled with books, including the diaries of their founder.<br /><br />There's also more friction between America and Maxon (and Aspen) as America continues to wrestle with her feelings for the prince and the competition as a whole. Cass walks a fine line between America becoming just a little too wishy washy, but I think she backed off and/or added enough explanation at the right time to make this a believable situation for me.<br /><br />I'm anxiously awaiting the third installment. I still want to know so much more about Illea and the rebels. And I can't wait to see who will choose who in the end!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Ok...I usually frown on 5 star reviews because I think I have a different idea of what a 5 star recording should sound like or compare to...like albums like Abbey Road Pet Sounds or Rumours...that being said...Time is NOT Rod Stewart's best record...not even close.  What it happens to be is the BEST thing he has put out since...in your humble reviewer's opinion...his best recording since the early 80's.  Not only did he start writing songs again he sings them with feeling.  This CD also has a different type of sound...crisp with depth.  After 5 standards albums...a soul and 70's covers album...AND a Christmas album...I lost hope that he would ever do anything original again.  This does not rank up with his best albums which are in my opinion...Every Picture Tells A Story, Never A Dull Moment, A Night On The Town, Footloose and Fancy Free, Foolish Behavior, Tonight I'm Yours, Body Wishes, and Out of Order...but it is VERY close.  Rod's lyrics were never ground breaking but here they are straight forward and come from a man who has lived and learned and is now reflecting on his past and what he wants his future to be.  If you like Rod Stewart...but this album and play it LOUD!

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this film at the theater, and when it came out on DVD, I knew I wanted to add it to my collection.  It was a good study of the characters involved, their quirks and foibles and their reasons for being where they were in that time of life.  I loved that it showed senior citizens coping with loss and new-found love in a humorous yet poignant way.  It was funny, sad and serious in appropriate situations, and as a senior myself, I could identify with their outlooks and emotions.  I have recommended it to several friends and family members, and know I will watch it over and over, and still get the same enjoyment from it that I did the first time

0385535147|3.0|I have long been a huge fan of John Grisham, but have found his last few books disappointing. The Litigators was especially disappointing, being just recycled ideas from other novels and I wondered if I would read another. Fortunately The Racketeer was quite a bit better. It started out really well and had me really hooked at one point, but once the twist happens it gets quite predictable, once again using ideas from previous books (in this case The Firm). Anyway I did enjoy it, but definitely not vintage Grisham.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series, the characters, the stories, how everything intertwines, the challenges characters are faced with. I have no idea what's going on in season 4. Though it's been months since I've watched season 3, I haven't gotten over how it ended.

B00BLCHZC2|5.0|The writing is fabulous, absolutely stunning.

B00AIBZM40|5.0|My favorite kinda horror movie.  No cutting people to ribbons.  No bloody mess.  No torture.  Just good clean evil.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  I luva ghost story.  This one reminds me of The Ring, or a little Messingers, or Darkness.  And a good bit like The Woman In Black.  Just plain eerie, especially the first half before you see more of what's spooking you.  It gives you the willies.  Not Willie Nelson . . . Although you may think, \\"Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be haunted!\\" Which is what these little girls are.  Good movie to watch on Halloween, although the kiddies won't want to go out for Tricks or Treats after watching it.  They won't go to bed either.  At least not ALONE . . .
193700788X|3.0|*****WARNING SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Hmm.. I really dont know exactly how I feel about this book. It definitely was not as good as I expected. Most the reviews I have read people are pissed about what choices Sookie made but to me they seemed valid. What made this book not so great for me was that it felt rushed just like Harris was so over it and she let it show, also Sookie got a Half-Assed happily ever after... that pissed me off the most. The writing itself was off too, the pacing was awful and the switch from third person to sookie and the extra events.. i dont think that was needed it just made things confusing. I would of rather had Eric's POV if she wanted to go for something different!<br /><br />I reread all 12 books before I started this one so the whole story was extremely fresh when I went into this book which I think has made a huge difference on how I took it verses others. Eric and Sookie's relationship had been failing since book 11 so it was no surprise things did not get fixed between them to me. Neither one of them was open and honest with the other and Eric was to damn busy to really be in a relationship..<br /><br />One thing I do not get from this series in general is why Sookie's reason for breaking up with Quinn was that she needed to be number one and his family would keep that from happening so she kicked him to the curb. Then she jumps in with Eric who puts everything over Sookie for their entire relationship and she knows he is going to do that.. boggles my mind!<br /><br />I dont blame Sookie for choosing not to be Eric's concubine after he \\"divorced\\" her or that she declined his offer to become a vampire. She was so ready for a \\"normal\\" life she had been complaining for the last 3 books about wanting peace and just to be happy, for the past 2 years of her life she had been beaten and in danger of dying nonstop so I would think that mundane would look pretty good compare to constant danger and politics of the vampire world.<br /><br />I have always thought Sam would be a great guy for her, just what she needed but I have to say reading the sex scene between the two of them felt odd... kind of like a brother and sister hook up. Maybe bc Sam has always been filled in that older brother type of roll.. idk but it was awkward for me to read felt wrong.<br /><br />The ending itself was just disappointing, I wanted a solid path for her to know that all was going to be right that she was going to get a break... what did I get some half-assed bs..sigh And now I have to wait 6 months to read the epilogue!!<br /><br />I do have to commend Harris for sticking to her guns on what she wanted to happen to Sookie, she even says in the first couple pages of the books that she stuck to what she wanted for Sookie and she knows people aren't going to be happy .. so basically to damn bad. Thats pretty bold more power to her!

B00CI5ET7K|4.0|First I have to prelude this review by admitting that I am a fan of Satch.  Have been since the release of Surfing with the Alien and never looked back.  I will admit that I was in doubt as to whether to give Unstoppable Momentum a 3 star rating or a 4 star rating. So I gave this CD two more listens before I consider writing out this review.  As with a lot of music, sometimes you need more than one pass to give a honest review.  Initially I was disappointed but after the last two listens the music has finally started to sink in.  Yes, it's a different sound but it's no doubt Joe.  The phrasing with the guitar, the tasty whammy licks and the moderate use of the Wah.  All key ingredients in the recipe of Joe Satriani.  True there may be no ground breaking tunes here but in all honesty Satch records what he feels and keeps it fresh by keeping fans guessing how the next record is going to sound.  Personally I'm still waiting on that heavy album that he needs to do, but I' ll certainly take what he dishes out and gladly.<br /><br />Is this for everybody?  Probably not.  If you are a Satch fan though you need to pick this CD up and give it a few listens.  Good tunes that take a couple listens to grow on you.<br /><br />4 stars.

B009NY43NY|1.0|The books went downhill with the one where Sookie was tortured.  Isn't that the same time as when the author had a serious personal loss in her life?  And of all the characters, SAM???? And it is like she wanted to bring back most of her friends and former lovers with cameos.  It was so forced.  I feel like the last two books should have been written by the fans because the author was not true to the characters at all.  It did not seem like I was reading a Sookie Stackhouse novel.  It would have been better if she stopped writing this series after book 10 or let someone else write it for her.  I will not read another Charlaine Harris series other than this.  I regret that I had pre-ordered the book following this one.

B00A81MV3U|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />So I finally got around to watching Silver Linings Playbook, the movie that everyone's been talking about, and I must say that I was pretty impressed. It's not perfect, but it has a lot of heart and I honestly can't remember seeing a movie this emotionally driven. It deals with some tough issues, mainly mental instability, and it does so with a degree of classiness that transforms this from a movie about the troubled to an emotional story about the changes people face on a day to day basis. We always want to go back to what we know, but sometimes that's not always what's best for us and we need to learn to move on.<br /><br />The story follows a young man by the name of Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) as he's released from a mental health facility. Eight months ago he caught his wife cheating on him and that's when he found out that he was suffering from a bipolar disorder. In an attempt to stay out of prison after beating his wife's lover half to death, he settled on a plea bargain with the courts allowing him to attend this mental facility to better himself. After his mom picks him up from the facility he creates a plan. He's going to do a lot of reading and exercising in order to keep his mind in a solid place, but he has a major roadblock. He can't let go of his wife.<br /><br />After having dinner at his friend Ronnie's (John Oritz) house, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany is a recent widow who just lost her job. She suffers from extreme depression which she handles by sleeping around with random people to help fill that void. She strikes up a deal with Pat when she tells him that she can get his letter to his wife. He would do it himself, but she had a restraining order put on him. In return for her help Pat agrees to assist her with this upcoming dance competition. What starts as two people helping each other soon turns into a deal filled with lies and deceit as the viewer learns that one of the parties involved may not be as helpful as they led you to believe. It's not done with ill intention so it feels fitting given the situation of both of these individuals.<br /><br />As a whole I felt the story was solid. I think the main focus was on these troubled individuals who are looked at as psychos in the \\"real\\" world when really they're just like everyone else. They're people struggling through life just like the rest of us. So I thought it was commendable when both the leads and a few of the supporting characters all had some sort of mental problem. What makes matters worse for these characters is that people do look at them like some sort of circus show. Whenever Pat would have an episode there was this kid who kept coming to the house to see if he could record it for \\"a school project\\". It makes you empathize with Pat and it leaves you feeling disgusted that there are people like that in the world.<br /><br />Everything in the story leads up to the dance competition and that's where I felt the film got a little rocky. It felt more like a means to an end than something substantial and I kind of felt like it derailed the mood set by the film's previous hour and 40 minutes. It's very loud and fun while majority of the movie is dark and somber. I understood its purpose in the big picture, but I think there may have been a better way to reach the point the movie sets out to make.<br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook is led by Cooper and Lawrence who both gave excellent performances. Cooper proves once again that he's beyond being the eye-candy in The Hangover films and that he's an actor who everyone should take seriously. This was actually my introduction to Ms. Lawrence and I thought she gave a solid performance. I can't say that I understand all the hype around her just yet, and I don't understand how she won an award over Cooper, but she has a lot of potential. I just feel like she's still a developing actress with a lot of room to grow.<br /><br />On top of the leads you have Robert De Niro playing Pat Senior, Jackie Weaver as Pat's mom, Chris Tucker as Pat's friend Danny, John Ortiz as Ronnie, and Anupam Kher as Pat's therapist Cliff. I said earlier that a few of the supporting characters had mental issues as well and those two characters would be Danny and Pat Sr. I don't remember if they specified what Danny's condition was, but Pat Sr. is a very superstitious individual suffering from OCD and he's also developed a slight gambling problem after losing his job. Out of the supporting cast I think De Niro gave the most memorable performance. He's always been able to tackle almost any role he's given and this was no different. With that said, everyone involved did a great job and it was nice to see Tucker on the big screen again.<br /><br />Finally, the movie suffers from a few minor inconsistencies. The most obvious being when Pat and Tiffany are at the dance. When they start walking up the stairs Pat's on the right and Tiffany's on the left, but once they reach the top they're randomly switched. I don't know about you, but I've never seen two people walking up a set of stairs holding hands only to switch places along the way. Then during one of the practices Pat's necklace is in the front of his shirt, but when frame cuts to Tiffany it's on his back. Lastly, I don't know if it was the lighting or what, but in some scenes Tiffany's hair looks red while in majority of the film it's black, or at least it looked black. Now none of this is major, but it's stuff that I noticed because of who I am.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.75/10 - Silver Linings Playbook is one of those films that is just so easy to fall in love with. Between the characters and the script everything feels so comfortable and familiar. It's almost as if we know these characters in real life, they just have different faces. Cooper's performance, in particular, is phenomenal and he really brings out the heart and soul of his character andhe gave, what I think, is the performance of his career. While the movie may not be perfect, there's a lot to love here and I definitely recommend taking the time to watch it.

B006CHML4I|2.0|Seiko is good brand but not this watch. I supposed to ecodrive that does not require any battery, but every time you take off the watch it stops working. Now next time you put it on and forget to adjust the time, you will never have right time when you need it. This simply makes the watch useless. On top of that ecodrive mechanics make too much noise. You can hear it working in a quit room.<br /><br />Nice strap indeed. I liked the strap very much but dial was too small for my small wrist.<br /><br />Overall, I like the watch but trying to remember to set the time everytime I put it on was too much. It was a hard habit to get in to. So not for me.

B009R659L8|5.0|Every mary higgins clark books are great and I have read everyone of them. If you like mysteries she is a must read author.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita's story inspired me and challenged my perception of so many things I have always believed.As more of these NDE books are published, it can't help but broaden our perspective and beliefs of the after life. Anita in a very authentic way spoke of life on the otherside, our purpose for being here. Most importantly, how incredibly loved we are for just simply being.<br />Her journey and what got her to that moment and everything that transpired afterwards is devestating and uplifting. A great inspiring true story!

B0070ZZ1SE|3.0|The 1976 SIRE Records two-LP set NUGGETS: ORIGINAL ARTYFACTS FROM THE FIRST PSYCHEDELIC ERA (SASH 3716-2) has 26 somewhat obscure tracks (17 in mono) that in some cases sound to these ears like the din of amateur garage bands.<br /><br />Inside the gatefold cover are paragraphs for each artist/track. B&W sleeve cover art is a collage of singles, studio potraits, posters, etc. The back cover has a playlist and essay on the psychedelic era written by this collection's producer/programmer, Lenny Kaye (former guitarist in the Patti Smith Group).<br /><br />RANDOM PERSONNEL TRIVIA<br />Standells Larry Tamblyn was brother to actor Russ, and Dick Dodd (son of Jimmy) was an original Mouseketeer.

0988936402|5.0|I'm not ordinarily a fan of YA fantasy, but I tried to keep an open mind when I cracked open this book. I'm so glad I did. It's a well-crafted adventure, leaping between the real and imaginary world. The story is strong and easy to follow with kudos to the author for creature development. I found it a welcome departure from more stultifying works of this type.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|They may be the &#34;grandfather&#34; of electronica, but they sure know how to rock it!<br /><br />I've been in love with Dave Gahan's voice and Martin Gore's synth melodies since I was a teenager. Their music changes with each album, a re-invention of their musical style, with this album sounding more jazzy/bluesy than their previous work. Martin's beautiful melodies on this album are soulful and there is a new depth to each song. It took a few listens before I was completely in love all over again, but the guys should be extremely proud of this album. It's been a long time since they put such meaning and heart into their songs. Each song builds from the last and flows into the next. Just a beautiful addition to their entire repertoire.
0151008116|4.0|Good book, better than the film! Offers more insight into Pi and his survival techniques. Worth reading for these lazy days of spring.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love this movie and it plays perfectly. I also like having the option to watch it through the online account.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|It is a great story about endurance, patience, survival and ultimate friendship with only the primal needs as a common ground.
B004GJYROG|5.0|this is a great movie lots of childhood memories and memories of watching MJ play basketball he was an epic player too watch for sure!!! i'm glad to finally get it on dvd after a long long time of not seeing it! MJ was the icon for chicago,illinois during his time with the bulls he will forever be my favorite player! i recommend this movie too anyone who likes bugs bunny and the looney tunes and for any MJ fans great movie!

B00AQ71FLK|1.0|too hard to move and select other champions font even try pvp too many afk people and bad community. no one helps and people talk trash Eben when they know its 3v5
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|The other reviews try to chronologically list the \\"snap shots\\" of this young mans life with countless switching to different time frames in his short, but \\"exciting life\\". The answer to my 'review' title is \\"HAPPYNESS can only be found by sharing with others\\". He had many such sequences in his life, but did not recognize it till a day or two before his death. I would love to do what he did, and while I worked in four countries AT HIS AGE, and got mugged twice and almost died several more times. Because of this I learned early but slowly that I lacked his fearlessness as I aged. Watch this movie looking for things you might want to do in your life, but did not. Then as you aged wished you had done them. HE DID IT, but at a cost to his mother, father, sister and his life! I wanted a happy ending that almost came several times except for fate! The \\"high water, the misreading of editable plants, the old man, the moose hunters coming two weeks to late et el. WATCH IT, BUY IT, and EXPERIENCE IT!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game has a wide variety of games to it.You have much more than just a h/o game and is fairly long. I like that after each chapter it tells you the percentage of how much you've played so far so you know if you should just keep playing to the end or have time for a break.It's definitely worth the money compared to all those out there that overcharge for just h/o without any story.
B000P0I4O4|5.0|Like another reviewer, who liked this movie and felt the reviews were to low I agree. I also noted far to many undeserved low and one star reviews. Because of this I almost wrote off this movie. However, I'm glad I ignored those reviews. I actually REALLY liked this movie. In the past I have chosen to watch several action-thriller movies where they seem to cookie cutter design their action sequences, but who cares if its good cookies. Why skip or complain about a movie that does it. The action was full boar and the acting was solid with big name stars. Take a chance, as I often do, and you may find a lot of GREAT SLEEPERS waiting to entertain you! I am sure you will love the story and the actions, thrills with a couple of simple twists, and you are bound to like some of the GOOD-BAD GUYS. This movie deserves a solid 4.8 so I bought it, and I had to give it a 5.0!!!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I enjoyed the first season- must order season 2 now! Dexter is an interesting guy and I really like the idea behind the show.

0385349947|5.0|Every woman (and man) should read this book!  The book is thought provoking, inspirational, and hits on a number of important topics.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is without doubt the best sci-fi book written by an independent author I've read so far. I really enjoyed it from start to finish. It is the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars, presumed dead and left behind by the rest of the crew. Wounded and with few resources, Mark Watney, must find a way to survive in a desert and hostile planet.<br />The words with which the novel opens delineate the tone immediately. We are faced with the irony of a character that has nothing to lose and finds in himself, also thanks to its scientific expertise, the strength to fight for his own survival.<br />The story starts with an assumption which is not correct, i.e. a sandstorm has forced the crew to abort the mission. This is impossible given that the Martian atmosphere is so thin that, even in case of strong winds, these are not able to cause any damage, beside covering everything with powder. But this is fiction, not reality.<br />With the suspension of disbelief the story begins, and from that point on it is a succession of brilliant stunts. Mark is from time to time to face new challenges and find improbable, but not impossible solutions. At the same time you follow the action on Earth, at the mission control, where at the beginning the protagonist is believed to be dead. Here, too, the irony rules. Several times I laughed out loud while reading. The dialogues are withering. Same for the diary of Mark, which is at times hilarious, almost as if the protagonist, trying to deal with fear for his condition, jokes about it, according to a custom typical of American films and TV series.<br />The result is a really beautiful hard sci-fi novel.<br />Reading the reviews, I found out that the author has published it in serial form, and only in the end he released the entire novel. I must say that considering how the story is structured, with a number of problems that arise and are resolved, it actually looks episodic, but I admit that while reading I had not realized it at all.<br />The excellent work of Andy Weir, apparently, has been rewarded. The book was bought by a major publishing house and will be re-released in 2014. In the meantime, it is still available as audiobook.<br /><br />Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of [[ASIN:B00L979374 Red Desert - Point of No Return]]The excellent work of Andy Weir, apparently, has been rewarded.

0470913029|5.0|I recommend this  book to all needing to lose weight, correct heath problems and experience optimal heath !<br />A more in depth review of the Paleo life style but worth the read. Great recipes also
193700788X|4.0|Gee Whiz.  It is light vampire fiction, folks.  I am a little stunned at the number of really angry reviews.  The author did a perfectly workmanlike job of tidying up the loose ends and giving us a satisfactory ending.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Fast paced thriller with some good twists, enjoyed the fast reading and are not reading the next book in the series.
031603441X|3.0|I got the audio book version of this and a large part of it is entertaining. Some is interesting and a lot stinks. I particularly didn't enjoy the ins and outs of junkiedom as described in excruciating detail. Dull and boring on top of decadent.<br /><br />Keith says he should be given a pass because he's a rock star and that's the way it is man! He berates the police (often delusionally believing he's being followed...talk about ego!) and then complains when they don't help him out. He rants about how misunderstood he is but offers no evidence to support it. He seems enamored with gaining a gangster image for himself. But every time he gets in a jam, he's quick to name drop and hire high powered attorneys. But real gangsters would have chewed him up and spit him out.<br /><br />When he does talk about the music, which is not all that often, it is great stuff. We find out how Angie came about (although I always suspected that the ground breaking instrumental 'Anji' influenced the song) and how his paranoia led to Gimme Shelter. When he discusses guitars and licks...yeah baby! The trouble is, you won't get to say 'Yeah Baby' too often.<br /><br />Shoulda been a five. I gave it a three for failing to live up to what it could have been.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|With Rod Stewart's new album of 11 original penned tunes by Rod himself. This not only makes a statement, but it marks the return of Rod's lyrical voice.<br />A voice that we've been parched with thirst for, for some twenty years now. If you like any Rod original album from the early 70's or enjoyed the lesser praised \\"Spanner in the works\\" album, you will need this album like no other Stewart album that has come before it. All the tracks open you up back into the inner workings of the mind and voice that launched the music staples such as \\"Maggie May\\" \\"Tonight's the night\\" \\"You wear it well\\" \\"Forever Young\\" etc.<br /><br />Revisit his voice. Rediscover his soul.<br /><br />Otherwise we are doomed to lesser efforts like the Songbook series. If I may say, a songbook series or cheap covers is not how a rock legend of his stature should ever be reduced to again!<br /><br />Buy Time now. For yourself, for your mom, for your friends, for your dog or to save rock n roll. Doesn't matter. Just put it in your shopping cart and go. You know you want to!

0783222955|5.0|Gregory Peck was outstanding in his role, as was the entire ensemble. This movie must be rated as one of the top 10 ever made. Touching story of how the Africian-American was treated, or, yet, mistreated in the south in th 20's. Brilliant work by all associated with this movie.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I had this before, but someone lost my DVD, so I bought another one since I like it so much.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|This album is one of the few-ever perfect marriages of sophisticatedly profound poetics with virtuosic musical composition and performance. Even in trying to sum it up in one sentence, I trip over my own words like an idiot who can't pronounce the words he's using. I myself sprang for the \\"deluxe\\" edition with the comosition book of Ms. Apple's lyrics and sketches (plus the live-performance DVD). With or without it, this album is an overwhelming aesathetic experience, because of and in honor of which one might be disinclined to pay for or pay attention to any other music for a year's time. I can't even go into the details of the songs themselves - Ms. Apple's lyrics, piano playing and vocal delivery all close in on the songs like fingers into a fist, for each selection. I've read others' attempts to aptly describe or appropriately quote the songs on this album, and I find that almost everyone fails to approximate a listener's experience of the songs. Indeed, these songs aren't to be merely listened-to, but experienced by the listener; that this entire album is a comprehensive experience itself, making cherry-picking the selections which one can more comfortably digest seem a desecration of the entire work. Fiona Apple is as amazing as she is humble about it. A lot of musicians should follow her example on both counts.
B00003CXBK|3.0|Ok cartoo, but not as good  I expected. I wish it is better because I read the ad as in the website.
