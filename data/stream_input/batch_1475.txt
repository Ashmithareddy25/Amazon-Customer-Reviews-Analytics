B004JHYRYU|5.0|Historical WWII, mystery, and love. ' \\"Who is he speaking as now?\\" Carravagio thinks' (location 3236/4158). He is referring to the English patient of whome extends his arm to receive another morphine shot. The thought processes are deep and symbolism ties events and feelings to what seems to be destiny, characters express themselves as if the mind has been stimulated.  Remembering the very instance one fell in love and how they knew it, every instance, every glance, every word, and everything about that person he has figured out. A hightened mind may speak of these things as if wise to everything in life, yet real events prove that love is really a small thing the grand scheme of things. That's kind of sad isn't it? The novel makes me wonder if that can be true, however, I am not a veteran of a world war, and war changes everything.<br /><br />Four WWII veterans,  each who have served a different and unique role, and each who have become become disabled each in a unique way as a result. The stories that unfold throughout this novel are deep. So deep, they are open to a reader's interpretation. A bombed out Italian villa, a deserted hospital still wired with hidden explosives, becomes a beautiful, peaceful place where time stands still. These four beautiful people are surviving their pasts the best way they know how. Inner depths of their hearts, thoughts, and conversations are revealed by the author's unique writing style.<br /><br />I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys taking time to digest everything as they read; to take time to think about and try to fully understand a character. If read slowly, one can get so much out of this novel. Read slow, just like in the novel where time is standing still.<br /><br />I own the paperback, and recently downloaded the kindle version so I could travel with it and read it again on peaceful sea days. I have now read it twice, the first time about five years ago. The kindle version ends with some discussion questions, and upon mulling them over I have realized I still have much more to understand from this novel. It is a novel to keep on your bookshelf and treasure, a novel to discuss in groups, book clubs, or on on-line forums.upon mulling them over I have realized I still have much more to understand from this novel.

B0086700CM|5.0|I'm really glad that I didn't have to wait until it was finally on amazonappstore! Think I've had it for a couple of months now from play store! Major props to those who actually waited until it was here! :)
B00008G8LN|5.0|product was a great price and arrived in 3 days!  nice surprise  and it worked fine - no complaints i have no other words and I am sorry they make this survey so difficult!
B0041WVTBM|5.0|Great movie!!  I teach a class called Young and Middle Adult Development - on the college level, and was struggling to find something that was:<br />a.  entertaining<br />b.  touched on the whole \\"mid-life angst\\" thing<br />c.  and covered the final part of the literature, which was about coming to terms with one's mortality.<br /><br />Done, done, and done!  Such fabulous actors, and the soundtrack can't be beat.  Still not sure if my 19-22 year old students get it, but I had a blast.
B000093FLA|3.0|This is a hilarious story, but it is very rough.  It doesn't seem possible to use the f-word so often and in so many different ways, even embedding it into other words.  There are parts that make me laugh out loud, and I love the characters, but a lot the laughter relates to things that I'm not sure are really laughing matters?????  And then there are the REALLY rough parts that are hard to get through.  I love the gypsy dog that swallows the squeaky toy (and then squeaks when he barks) along with everything else in sight, the Russian mafia guy they just can't kill, the huge getaway driver who can't fit through the car door nor back into a large parallel parking spot... but I could do without the violent robbery, mass murder, attack dogs, and foul language.  Periwinkle blue, anyone?
B007MC868M|5.0|Living in the U.S. where \\"Phantom\\" is not due to be released until October of 2012, I bought the paperback edition from England because I didn't want to wait. I have read all of the Harry Hole novels (those translated into English at any rate) and this was one of my favorites. Harry returns to Norway to help one of the few people that he loves. The story delves into the seamy side of the drug world in Oslo and the crime that goes with it. It is almost impossible to write much about this book without giving away some of the key details/surprises of the story. I will say that Nesbo is impressive with his portrayal of Harry as the flawed hero, and stays true to the character. Can a fictional crime book be eerie and haunting?  I think so...the ending blew me away.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Great music -- ABBA hits sung by the stars (not always well sung, some of the stars deserve medals for actually being seen in public singing these songs).  Great fun, great visuals, great dancing, happy ending... who could ask for more?

B00005MP58|5.0|The story of many twist and turns in a very unlikely (and scorned) courtship in the 1800s.  Set in England, with beautiful scenery.  Very well cast, strong characters.  It seems quite impossible, but YES, there is a happy ending!  This romance keeps me laughing and sitting on the edge of my seat.

Yes, I think it is one of my all time favorites.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|About the seller... Got the movie in record time. Great price, great condition, Good job!<br /><br />About the movie... I was an avid fan of the Planet of the Apes series until I met Roddy McDowall (the original Planet of the Apes) in Mendocino, California. They were filming the movie \\"Overboard\\" with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell on the Mendocino coast. I worked in a small shop there and one day, Roddy McDowall walked in. I immediately recognized him but did not make any mention of that fact, I treated him like any other customer without bother or any special treatment. Roddy was stuck up, almost rude, which left me unimpressed. After that, I did not care to see any films that he was in.<br /><br />This version, \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\", is the most original since the very first Planet of the Apes but much more believable and refreshing. The special effects will draw you in to believing that the Chimpanzees, Gorilla and Orangutan are real. Great story, great effects!

B000002J5K|4.0|It seems unthinkable now that what started out as a musical act on a late night TV comedy show featuring musicians in bee costumes would morph into an entertainment blockbuster, but, to paraphrase Elwood Blues, the show business gods can work in mysterious ways. By 1977 the bees became the \\"Blues Brothers,\\" and in 1978 came the inevitable album, which soared to the top of the charts. With \\"Animal House\\" cleaning up at the box office, the next stage was inevitable.<br /><br />When \\"The Blues Brothers\\" movie finally arrived in theaters in the troubled summer of 1980 both Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi had long since ankled SNL and left their TV roots far behind (or so they thought, by 1981 Belushi's movie stratospheric movie career was already on a downswing and he was exploring a return to TV, according to Bob Woodward's biography, \\"Wired\\") and in many ways \\"Blues Brothers\\" was the culmination of the pop culture revolution SNL and the \\"Not Ready For Prime Time Players\\" had started when SNL went on the air in 1975. Movie critics, always a good ten  steps behind the curve, basically dismissed the movie as a pointless exercise in mindless moviemaking, seen as lacking in characters or plot, basically an excuse to blow millions of Hollywood studio dollars on car crashes and explosions. Perhaps if it had been in black-and-white, with characters speaking in Romanian with French subtitles,  they would have hailed it as great art. \\"Blues Brothers\\" was the book-end to \\"1941,\\" clear evidence that American movies were going to hell in a bloated budget hand basket.  At a more serious level, culture critics and academics attacked the film for privileging white performers over African American artists, an act of cultural colonialism, with Belushi and Aykroyd the great white hunters pillaging the native villages for  their own personal enrichment.<br /><br />To which the only appropriate  response is the great big fat  raspberry. One night in Cambridge I wandered into the House of Blues club. Duck Dunn (rest his soul) was performing. In-between songs he spoke about the \\"Blues Brothers\\". He said outright that neither Belushi or Aykroyd were very talented musicians, but he gave them all the credit in the world for using their celebrity status  to introduce the blues to an audience that otherwise would never have been exposed to it, in all likelihood.<br /><br />Bringing the blues to white suburban kids, using comedy and car chases as spoonfuls of sugar to help it go down, that is what \\"The Blues Brothers,\\" project was really all about. It's clear that unlike other pop culture pilferers who lift black music out of its original context and plug it into their own projects, with no regard to its deeper meanings or its  use as a way to transmit messages about the black experience  in America (no names, Quintin  Tarantino)  Belushi and Aykrord honored the music, the musicians who made it, and the life experiences that produced the blues. Diners, churches, concert halls, music shops, even the hard streets of Chicago, all are backdrops for performances in the film.<br /><br />The film, like the soundtrack, has gone on to endure, partly because it does have that historical respect and substance behind, and also because of its tremendous entertainment value. In essence \\"Blues Brothers\\"  are comfort food, guaranteed to raise a smile whenever you are feeling the blues or even the mean reds. The soundtrack has no real weak spots and, like every soundtrack or album  that has survived for over 30 years, stands up to numerous repeated listenings. For me the highlights include Aretha Franklin's show-stopping rendition of \\"Think,\\" the rollicking performance numbers from the film, \\"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,\\" and \\"Sweet Home Chicago,\\" \\"She Got the Katy,\\" which shows off Belushi at his best, vocally, and a dead-on parody of \\"Rawhide.\\" But it's also hard to go wrong with James Brown pulling out all the stops on the gospel- inflected \\"The Old Land Mark,\\" or hearing Cab Calloway twisting the tongues of young white people into knots while  scat singing on that old warhorse, \\"Minnie the Moocher.\\" There's even the \\"Peter Gunn Theme,\\" arguably the best TV theme song ever recorded, thrown in for good measure.  Sadly, the Jon Lee Hooker number from the film is not included, for recording company contractual reasons, one can only image.<br /><br />In retrospect, the \\"Blues Brothers\\" project represented the peak of the careers of Belushi and Aykroyd. We all know the tragic downward trajectory that Belushi was on  by 1981, and while Aykroyd would go on to have a very successful career as a character actor and businessman,  he would never be in any project with the impact of \\"Blues Brothers.\\" Still, how many other performers can claim a legacy as lasting \\"[[ASIN:B000002J5K The Blues Brothers: Original Soundtrack Recording]] Blues Brothers\\" ?<br /><br />Recommended for: Any one who's ever been 200 miles from Chicago, with a pack of cigarettes and half a tank of gas, in the dark, wearing sunglasses.

B005LAIGNC|1.0|true story ok, but the acting sucks there´s only three actors Ivé ever seen before and both me and my wife fell to sleep after thirty minutes of watching the movie,later I tried watching again and once again fell asleep(don´t buy untill you´ve rented first)just painfully boring.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The Hunger Games craze is everywhere. Many people are going to hate the this t that I am posting this.  Susan Collins is a truly tlented writer, but it is the same story line. Girl likes boy, but for some reason they can't be together, and at the end of the mess of details, they're  both alive and together. The other thing that I don't ike is the overall purpose. So many people have written about the future with a grim outlook. The City of Embers, Clone Codes, and many more. The Hunger Games is a very well written book, it just needs a new story line.
B006UREQ3Y|5.0|This dvd is an awesome edition to my collection of live dvds and music,the sound in dts is crystal clear and the actual video is good.It has songs from velvet revolver,guns \\"n\\" roses and slashes first album with miles along with interviews with slash and miles and for the most part was very well worth the $18 dollars I paid.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|(Wanted to add that I paid $37 for this when it was listed previously from what I now noted is up to $49. I wouldn't pay more than $40) I read a few reviews and crossed my fingers that I did not encounter any holes or defects in this product. But for $37 I was more than willing to give this product a try. The \\"Play Center\\" is a lot larger than I expected, but then again I am the type that assumes less than whats advertised or pictured. My husband used an electric air pump and we laid the \\"Play Center\\" on a piece of tarp, which I would highly recommend. Thankfully, I did not have any holes other than the ones that are used as sprinklers on the \\"Play Center\\". My 5 year old daughter and the other kids in the neighborhood enjoyed hours of play time with no damage or deflatation even with aggressive play on the slide.<br /><br />My experience with this product is so far a positive one. I am not sure what happen to a few of the other customers who purchased this product. Maybe it was defective or damage was done in the process. Maybe the company improved and corrected the errors upon the reviews, but whatever the case I am very satisfied with my purchase and I hope others experience the same positvie experience.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|This movie was better than I was expecting. It had some very creepy moments and gave me chills. It has a very old skool gothic look. Daniel Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer in charge handle the estate of Alice Drablow. After he arrives, eery things begin to happen and ghosts begin to appear. If you like gothic haunted house stories, you'll like THE WOMAN IN BLACK!!!
B0081KTI0E|4.0|This is a great way to get into the feel of a classic horror flick! No gore just a good story with lots of suspense and a few good thrills along the way. You need to watch it in the DARK!  Of course my wife may not agree as she spent most of the movie hiding under the blanket!
B0073PZIYI|5.0|If you're familiar with macro-economic theory, enjoy sci-fi, and are a jaded son-of-a-witch, then I don't see how you can go wrong with this movie. I went in expecting little and came away floored, and also ashamed of myself from expecting so little. All of the other reviews sum up the plot, actors, and everything else just fine. The only tidbit I feel compelled to add is that your own trials in life and your perception of monetary resources (which time is, in this film) will greatly influence how you perceive this film. I've scrapped and scraped my entire life. Because of that, In Time grabbed me and I wasn't able to blink until the end credits came up. Some may be offput by the heavy-handed metaphorical parallels to our current reality, but so what--it doesn't make it any less true that we are living in nearly this EXACT SOCIETY today. Kudos Andrew Niccol.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Of course, in the Hunger Games, the Gladiators are children, but in many ways this is a story of the Rome of old, and it is a very powerful story indeed.  Book 1 is simple and powerful.  Book 2 is difficult.  Not difficult to read, but it's ideas are uncomfortable to swallow, as ideas of political desperation often are.  Book 3 ends with a chilling twist.  You can't ask for better political commentary than these volumes, excellent reading.

B0015DROBO|5.0|As an author I found the book to be particularly intriguing. In Lizabeth Salander, Larson has created one of the great women characters of all time.<br /><br />In Larsen's second book, The Girl Who Played With Fire, the murcurial Lizabeth becomes even more exciting. She's just total dynamite.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]
0345803485|1.0|...And you can find at least that many departures from anything worth reading right here in this solidly one-star book.<br /><br />This is the story of Ana, who starts out as a likable sort of quasi-innocent Laura Ingalls/Bella Swan-esque young woman who meets Christian Grey, a 26 year-old billionaire/ corporate mogul/ concert level pianist/  philanthropist/ helicopter pilot/ Greek god/ mongo-controlling kinky sex guy. From there Ana's story rapidly devolves into Tess of the d'ubervilles, meets Perils of Pauline, meets Story of \\"O\\", meets B-rate, X-rated comic book wherein the lame, tenuous plot line exists only to move Ana from one weirdly degrading sexual situation to the next.<br /><br />Of COURSE genre fiction by definition requires one to suspend disbelief to a very large degree! That's part of the fun with any good fantasy tale, be it romance or sci-fi or steam-punk or whatever. But as this book ground pointlessly onward I found myself hoping for something, ANYTHING redeeming to happen. Maybe Christian might actually turn out to be like Sookie's Eric, a thousand year old vampire (which would have allowed Christian about enough time to evolve his remarkable litany of competencies), or maybe the evil aliens from \\"Halo\\" would (please!) show up and glass the planet (if only to save Ana from her own appalling judgement and ever-waxing, simpering idiocy) or maybe the indomitable Miss Temple would pop out of the pages of \\"Glass Books of the Dream Eaters\\" (to serve as a role model for poor Ana with respect to how a supposedly intelligent and decent young woman deals when her Greek god turns out to be a nut ball of Christian's magnitude... In a tasteful, literary fashion, poke him in the eye with a sharp pencil, maybe?)<br /><br />Having grown up in Seattle and attended WSU, I strongly suspect that the author of 50 \\"Shades of Grey\\" has not been any closer to either place than an internet search could bring her. I think it is a great shame this book provides a shallow,awful portrayal of how an initially promising character's life and dignity can be appallingly debased, and then be left at the story's ending without having been afforded the opportunity for finding much in the way of redemption, or even having much of a clue that she even needs it. (Think Sheltering Sky or some similar tome of existential despair). Fifty Shades of Grey is bad plotting and mediocre writing by an author who appears solely interested in providing voyeuristic jollies to the reader. The greater shame, however is that a character as screwed up as Christian Grey didn't get to add \\"convicted felon\\" to his long list of accomplishments and wind up having to do court-ordered community service in an abused women's shelter. I'm pretty sure the author of this book has never visited one of those, either.<br /><br />The GOOD news is that the Kindle download (my first) worked perfectly and that the Kindle is really a cool way to get and read anything you want! Next time, though, I'll read the Amazon reviews before pushing the download button!

1423389387|5.0|My son listened to it over and over. The CDs are fantastic; the reading is exceptional. I loved the book, but listening it so well performed on CD makes it such a great travel companion, especially since it is obviously professionally done. I appreciated the quality of the performance and the quality of the recording.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Having just re-watched the original Men in Black mere hours before, I was really excited to see Men in Black III. Sure, some of the special effects in the original were cheesy, and some of the humor was dated (it's been a while since I've heard a joke about Dennis Rodman), but the film remained very enjoyable. I thought the new film would fall short of the original, while still improving on the abysmal Men in Black II, and for the most part, I was right.<br /><br />I really like Tommy Lee Jones, but he mostly looks bored and tired here. Similarly, Emma Thompson cashes a paycheck here as the new Chief; she has one completely excruciating moment doing a vocal impression of an alien—it was meant to be funny, but like so many jokes in the film, it was more cringe-worthy. I saw it at the midnight screening, and laughter was very scarce. The screenplay by Etan Coen (not to be confused with Ethan Coen of the Coen Brothers) featuring uncredited work by David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson (who worked together on the unbelievably bad Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) is so aggressively mediocre, so barely passable that even the strong cast never really elevates it. If were a producer on this film, I would have demanded a rewrite. It's hard to make a strong film without a strong script, and this is sadly no exception.<br /><br />Here's the good news: Will Smith is as likable and charming as ever; there are better actors than him, but few with a more intensely and charismatic on-screen presence. The real treat here, however, is Josh Brolin, playing a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. This is not an easy task, of course, as Brolin is not just asked to play a stiff and mechanical character; he is asked to play a younger Tommy Lee Jones playing a stiff and mechanical character. Brolin is in the film a great deal more than Tommy Lee Jones is, and once seeing the magic of John Brolin emulating Tommy Lee Jones wears off, there is substance here; he delivers a very, very strong performance, the unquestionable highlight of the film.<br /><br />So what exactly is the film about? Boris the Animal (played by an unrecognizable Jermaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords fame), an intergalactic criminal, breaks out of prison with one mission and one mission only: to kill agent K (Jones) who arrested him in the late 60s (and shot off his left arm in the process). Basically, it's all an excuse for Will Smith to go back to the 60s, have some fun time traveling experiences, save younger Agent K (Brolin) from Boris, and have a really happening time. I expected the portrayal of the late 60s to be completely stale, but most of it actually works quite well. Bill Hader of Saturday Night Live has a cameo as Andy Warhol, and it's both a good impression of Warhol and a hilarious performance.<br /><br />Even when Men in Black III works, though, it never feels particularly important; there's no real reason for this film to exist. I'm not saying every film has to be Rashomon or anything, but some version of this film has been done before and much better (for example, Back to the Future). If you liked the first film, you'll probably enjoy this, but you can wait to rent it.ery strong performance, the unquestionable highlight of the film.<br /><br />So what exactly is the film about?

B0084IG7KC|5.0|I saw a preview for this movie before it was in theaters and that alone made me run out and get a copy of the book.  It was a definite page-turner and the movie was no different.  Yes some scenes from the book had to be cut out for time constraints (the movie is already 2 and a half hours) but it doesn't feel like that at all.  It is fast paced, intense and there is quite a lot of depth to each of the characters.  This movie isn't for young children, though the book is written for teens -- anyone 13 and up it is appropriate for.  I would definitely recommend the movie for anyone who's read the book.  If you haven't read the book and are looking for a great film, this movie is very good -- but it lacks a few elements that Susanne Collins brought to life in the original novel.  Five out of five stars!

B005LAIGZU|5.0|I had the unique opportunity to see this film 2 years before it's commercial release due to some Navy Duty I was tending to.  Before all of the computer & TV images, digital type on the screen during scene changes, music and all the other \\"Hollywood\\" stuff was added.  It was basically an action-packed film about possible current-day events and incorporating some true events that real SEALs have faced.  When the movie ended, I was in awe.  I had the opportunity to meet \\"Mouse\\" McKoy and listen to how this story was developed and how the SEALs had direct input on the Operations & story portrayed.<br /><br />Since that time, I had been looking forward to the release of this film to the big screen.  I took my family to see it and all were impressed.  I was doubly-impressed after viewing it with the added graphics & soundtrack, etc.  I was even more impressed by the audience at the end of the movie.  There was no cheering or hooting & hollering.  Instead, it was as if each one of them held a reverence for the everyday sacrifices that the SEALs and other Military men & women make for our country.<br /><br />Critics are critics.  Of course they'll find something to fault with the movie, that's their job.  It doesn't surprise me that they don't like the acting... cuz these guys were the real deal.  I'll take a dozen SEALs over 1 actor ANY DAY.  C'est Livre.  This is a great movie1  20x better than the false \\"Navy SEALs\\" of 1990 era.  THAT was terrible acting and a crap movie.  God Bless the SEALs for being able to do what they do and their families that support and wait for them.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time and I listen to a wide variety of music. It is a perfect blend of all things musical and emotional. I noticed another reviewer found fault with the short duration of each track - what a silly thing to base a review on. Either you like the songs or you don't. Duration is rather moot. Anyways I love the quick pace of the album and how it smoothly transitions from wild jungle music to soft sultry soul and back again.  I feel great sadness (and happiness) whenever I listen to this album. Dilla shared his heart through his music and this album is probably the best example of that.<br /><br />edit: also the production values are very high on this album. The clicks and sudden transitions are intentional and add a certain feel to the music. Listening through a nice pair of headphones or speakers demonstrates the quality of sound of the tracks.

This video just makes me wish I was at the actual concert. Yet, seeing it on Blu-ray is probably the best seat in the house. The visuals are almost as amazing as the band itself. The music is so well arranged, you would almost feel like you are listening to her CDs. From the intro to the end, Sade live is great. I hope it doesnt take her another ten years to release another album of new material and tour. This release definitely makes me want to experience it live. I remember hearing of her tour and seeing the ticket prices. After watching this video, I completely understand why the prices were high. GREAT show!!!!!! I cant say anymore, just great.

B00863DOL0|4.0|\\"A Knight in York\\" Very good , My wife and I miss the twins. BUT a very good video of current Blackmore's Night. I would not be so critical as one review listed. As no DVD is a FULL length video of a concert , or if they put it all on video ...Why Go to see them. That's a no brainer and as that person also added \\"poor Production\\" he did state he never has even seen the video yet\\" so how could he be talking about how it was produced???? Beats me ! He also stated that this video is 80 minutes and is actually 95 minutes. So if this guy is so willing to blow this DVD out as bad , he does need to get his facts straight. I love Richie Blackmore since 1968 and Candice Night and she has done more with him than anyone else has  and they have a great sound and keep developing it as the years go on and will keep on doing so. I look forward to more live performances by them on DVD as it seems that chances are growing slim that we will see them in the United States, If they do it will be an event we will fly to see them. Red Rocks would be a great place ....Our own natural Castle...!!! BUT,,,,we do miss the twins !!!

0345803493|5.0|Fast read for a 532 page book! Couldn't put it down. Storyline picks up right where Fifty Shades of Grey ended fluidly. The story is well written, as they all are; however, I find the vocabulary a little advanced (especially for Ana) -- I mean, most 20-somethings don't speak that way, nor do they use email as a primary source of communication ... I would've found that aspect of the story more believable if they Facebooked or texted one another. Otherwise, I loved every minute of it!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Lags and glitchie but pretty fun. My game is stuck on the title page. Every time I try to press start on the screen, there is a noise but it won't go into the game. I made it all the way to level 37 before this happened. Please update so I can play some more!!
0345803507|5.0|The remaining book in the trilogy is just as fantastic as its predecessors! As with Fifty Shades Darker, Freed picks up where Darker ends and has more secrets, scandal and steam for its readers. Again, this book is a page-turner like the first two -- so much so, I finished the trilogy in 5 days. Now, I'm waiting for the movies to come although I'm sure they will be relatively watered down to earn an R-rating or even an NC-17 ... These films would X-rated otherwise. I'd encourage people to read the books first!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Game is great, good thinking puzzle logic games, really makes you use your book learning. Even if you only have your grade 10 this is a great way to get smarter and stuff
0345803485|5.0|The first of three novels starts out with a bang! Author does a fantastic job building up the tension between the main characters, Ana and Christian, and delivers at the moment of truth. Couldn't wait to read the next book!
0140714855|5.0|This is my favorite Shakespeare play. Only King Lear and Hamlet equal it, and maybe surpass it, in philosophical depth but the play's gentleness and optimism give audiences a glimpse of heaven rather than of hell.<br /><br />The Tempest is a romance but it contains a tragic element too, with the tragedy taking place many years before the play begins. Prospero was Duke of Milan but he preferred studying in his library over carrying out his duties. His academic hubris led him to trust his brother Antonio, who overthrew him. Antonio could not bring himself to murder Prospero and his daughter Miranda, so instead he set them adrift to let the sea rid him of his brother. Fate brought Prospero and Miranda to a magical island and as the play starts, fate brings Antonio within reach of Prospero.<br /><br />Prospero's learning becomes useful, as does his wisdom. He wants justice, not revenge. He orders the enslaved spirit Ariel to blow a storm so that Antonio and his fellow passengers, including the King of Naples with his brother Sebastian and his son Ferdinand, are thrown to shore on different parts of the island.<br /><br />Prospero's other slave Caliban (for the not-perfectly-good Prospero is the master of slaves) meets with some drunken servants and plots to overthrow Prospero. Sebastian plots with Antonio's help to murder the king and take the crown. Prospero sees all and their plans fit into his. By the end, Miranda marries Ferdinand, Prospero forgives Antonio, the King forgives Sebastian, Ariel is set free into the air, and Caliban is left alone with his malice on the island, once again his own king.<br /><br />Forgiveness is indeed the theme of the play. Why does Prospero not kill Antonio? He has every reason to, and in fact it would be the safe thing to do. Prospero knows he lost his dukedom because he neglected his duties; it was his fault. Having tasted power, Antonio naturally seized it so an understanding Prospero forgives him.<br /><br />Prospero is a stern master. He rebukes Ariel for presuming to demand his promised freedom, but he does free him (or her, Ariel is both feminine and masculine). He treats Caliban harshly even though he owes him much, but he does leave him master of the island at the end. And Prospero is ultimately gentle. Though the lesson is hard he values his gentleness. He forgives his malefactors and frees his slaves.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyoter. He rebukes Ariel for presuming to demand his promised freedom, but he does free him (or her, Ariel is both feminine and masculine). He treats Caliban harshly even though he owes him much, but he does leave him master of the island at the end. And Prospero is ultimately gentle. Though the lesson is hard he values his gentleness. He forgives his malefactors and frees his slaves.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo

I love sudoku and kakuro so this is along the same lines.  If you like numbers and logic, this is the game for you! I'm more comfortable with untimed games, so this is good for me.<br /><br />I am still enjoying this game so much!  I wait impatiently for updates with new puzzles and am enjoying the new \\"random\\" feature.

B001HN6918|5.0|Kung Fu Panda 2 will NOT disappoint those who were big fans of the first one.  In fact the sequel is more action-oriented (in some cases overwhelmingly so!).  Right from the very beginning we're introduced with a fighting segment involving our favorite panda bear named Po.  His friends from the first one return and find themselves in the same zanny and outrageous situations as before.  Without giving it a second thought, they help Po whenever danger calls.<br /><br />In this adventure, Po has to battle a peacock who's less than friendly.  In fact this peacock is ruler of the land and calls the shots.  Once he and Po meet, the peacock insists they've met before but Po disagees.  As a result, hilarious lines are exchanged between the two and some of the most explosive fighting scenes appear soon after.  The peacock wants him destroyed but of course, that can't happen!  No way!<br /><br />What makes this storyline different from the first one is how it centers around Po's childhood and particularly how he was abandoned by his parents.  Po is aware of his mysterious past and wants to find out more about it.  He sets out in search of clues and realizes the peacock is the one who has the answers but... Po gets a not-so welcoming interaction whenever he gets too nosey and finds himself caught up in the peacocks business.  Another interesting feature is that there's very little training- Po is already fully charged and ready to take down anything with his \\"skills\\".  You can probably guess why I put \\"skills\\" in quotation marks- the way Po knocks out the bad guys is based entirely on being in the right place at the right time with all the right objects surrounding him!<br /><br />Overall, fans of animation will be mighty impressed with the creative visuals that constantly remain full steam ahead, and this is honestly how a sequel *should* be done.  It's exciting from beginning to end.  Highly recommended for all families.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg I downloaded this and have been stuck on it for 2 hours... if you like to be challenged you gotta try this thank you imangi studios
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game but I always had to play it on my friends iPhones because amazon didn't have it but now I'm am so happy.... this just made my day
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|not one to write long reviews but this trilogy was AMAZING! I am 38 and was doubtful of  this young adult trilogy, but it was just such a treat. I hated it to end. It seems like I am coming down off of a drug. LOL.  Such an exciting book with a lot of metaphors to life.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this CD. I was just sitting on my couch and clearly I could hear \\" That's the Way of the World\\" in my consciousness. Whenever that happens I actually go to Amazon to purchase the song. It is a great service to have access to music immediately from the 70's, 80's, even classical music. A+
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent app!! I love the different translations, plans, and having it connected with my Facebook. Just to name a few!!
B0086700CM|5.0|The best game ever! at first my friend holly was playing it and I was like that's boring but then I played it and its awesome get it NOW finally no more temple rum or temple funk or any of that crape its here and I'm excited it looks AMAZING on kindle fire love emily
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I've never cared for television much, but this is one show I can't miss. It's zany, fun, and smart. I'm pleased this series has so many episodes. There's not a single misstep in the entire first season.
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|Our only complaint is that there should have been more Oscars handed out for this wonderful film. Beautifully written and acted, this film delivers over and over. From helping us understand the risks black people took in the 50's and 60's when they stood up and asked to be treated humanely, to showing the love showered on all children by these brave women, AND the courage of some whites in the south to stand up under horrible pressures, \\"The Help\\" is wonderful.<br /><br />We'd give it 10 stars if we could.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|I caught the last 20 minutes of this film on TV, but I didn't know what it was about. Being a sci-fi fan, I wanted to know the rest of the story so I went to another site to watch it, but they didn't have it. It's a nice old school post-WWII super hero romp. It's not Shakespeare, but it is entertaining, and renting from Amazon was easy and worked well, for a reasonable price. I'd rent from Amazon again, if the need arose.
B007G5K066|3.0|Bought this movie because Gary Oldman always delivers the character he was given. That he did.<br /><br />We kept waiting for the plot to develop, and it never did. When the movie ended we both wondered what it all meant, and at the same time, why we would even care.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|Was as expected: light, romantic, enjoyable, comedy. Well not that much of a comedy but ok. Certainly predictable but so what? Lots of big name actors, lots of subplots. Timing was good as no long pauses in plot(s). Good date night movie. Recommend for what it is.
0345529057|2.0|This books are great and I highly recommend to read them!<br />altough,The book quality is bad: small font,dark papers,small papers.<br />It seems that the pages will come off any sec,the books that the books came with fell a part in the same say that I got them,The paint in the cover is bad,The color is coming off,<br /><br />I do recommend reading it but not from thise package
B00526ZKYS|4.0|The book is well written and held my interest.  Additionally, the characters are memorable, brave and daring. However, the characters also come across as the ultra smart teens vs. the super clueless adults. I prefer a more balanced story line with each generation contributing positively to the story in some way-- definitely designed for the younger crowd. I also love the forbidden love/tragedy aspect of the book. This book is a fun,hard to put down book.  Enjoy!
B002N5N4M6|1.0|I was so excited to receive this in the mail because i had missed bits and pieces when it originally aired, and the whole first disk wont play!!!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I watched this movie over and over again. A true story about man trying to win his wife love again.....Love it! Love it! I truly love a romantic movie. Channing Tatum body was a sheer plus for me also. This movie is up there with Notebook and Dear John.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|I badly want to give this marvelously made and wildly entertaining film five stars. But like the master detective, I have to keep my emotions in check and limit it to four. Here's why.<br /><br />There have been attempts to bring Sherlock Holmes into the 20th & 21st centuries, including the mediocre Basil Rathbone films (which were contemporary out of simple cheapness) and a current British TV series. But the Victorian Holmes is timeless, and needs no updating or re-imagining. Conan Doyle's stories continue to please, not solely because we all love mysteries and Holmes is so deucedly clever at solving them, but because the tales have a fundamental humanity. Doyle had the sense to make them dramas -- stories about the people caught up in crime, both the victim and villain.<br /><br />Anyone attempting to \\"update\\" Sherlock Holmes has to acknowledge the British TV series with Jeremy Brett. His is one of the greatest performances by any actor, ever. His Holmes handily transcends Doyle's (in the same way Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" makes the original seem a pale copy). It's an absolute reference, which anyone attempting to \\"reimagine\\" Holmes ignores at their peril.<br /><br />The makers of \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" insist their version is significantly closer to Doyle's conception than just about anything that's come before (ignoring Brett, presumably). This is broadly true -- mostly because Sherlock Holmes adaptations have generally not been very good. As they correctly point out, the Holmes of Doyle's stories is a street-wise actor with an infinite variety of disguises, and an athlete capable of more than holding his own in a scrap. These are usually described after-the-fact in the stories, so actually //showing// them is a pleasing improvement.<br /><br />Of course, Sherlock Holmes' raison d'etre is, like Spock's, the fact that he //isn't// \\"human\\". The producers go astray in trying to humanize Holmes, discarding what makes him unique -- especially the ability to strike a vivid contrast with the \\"normal\\" characters. Though his friendship with and affection for John Watson are real, they are anomalies in his personality. Holmes is a misanthrope, very much aware of his superiority to other people. When he laughs, he's usually laughing at you, not with you.<br /><br />Despite his placing justice above the law, and sometimes skirting the latter so that the former might better be served, Sherlock Holmes is a fundamentally cerebral and asexual creature. To lower his pedestal closer to the ordinary person -- especially by having him show even faint sexual attraction to Irene Adler (whom, in the canon, he admired because she was close to his mental equal) -- is an unforgivable, incomprehensible error.<br /><br />This movie's Sherlock Holmes is much too-human, decidedly un-cool when he needs to be at his frostiest, too willing to admit his weaknesses, to a point where we sometimes feel an embarrassed pity. He even shows regret when he hurts Watson's fiancee's feelings. Doyle's Holmes never descended to that level. (Dr Gregory House (whose name plays on \\"Ho[l]mes\\") is, other than his occasional sex with women, almost equally aloof.) It doesn't help that Downey's Holmes is sometimes downright goofy, an unpleasant reminder of Mel Gibson`s ridiculous performance in \\"Maverick\\".<br /><br />The original Sherlock Holmes is sui generis. Any change to his personality is a diminution, not an improvement. Had this film's Holmes been closer to the tougher and chillier Holmes of the novels and stories, I might have awarded it five stars.<br /><br />The film has other weaknesses, most-notably Rachel McAdams' disastrous miscasting. Doyle's Irene Adler is elegant, intelligent, and a mistress of manipulation. McAdams' Adler is none of these, little more than a bimbo with a spectacular wardrobe. We cannot believe Sherlock would have any interest in her, for any reason.<br /><br />Jude Law is merely acceptable as Dr Watson. Inthe stories, he's roughly Holmes' contemporary, but in the film he seems much younger. We expect an experienced human being with some \\"gravitas\\", but Law doesn't convey that -- especially for someone who served several years in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Nor is the mystery much of a mystery. Once you've eliminated the impossible -- that the supernatural is real -- what remains is an obvious truth, and the story plays out that way. (What is the point of a master of logic confronting villains with supernatural powers?) At least the sequel is perfectly set-up -- \\"guess who\\" pulls all the strings in this first film, with a goal quite different from those whom he manipulates.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes fans are likely to be //at least// a bit disappointed. (Probably more.) I suggest they simply enjoy this film as a highly entertaining adventure. It can -- indeed, must -- be enjoyed on that level.the stories, he's roughly Holmes' contemporary, but in the film he seems much younger.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I would say that this app it great for all ages.<br />If you like fish, cards, dice, cars and all above then I would say that you  get this app :)
B008510WAE|1.0|I was thriled to see Luxor for the Kindle. The graphics are gorgeous but it shuts down almost every time you start it. Please fix and update ASAP!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I don't normally read these types of books but after hearing so much about it, I decided to give it a shot. There story line is quite intense and the characters definitely draw you in. Christian struggles with his past and his sexual preferences while Anastasia is as innocent as they come. Their relationship is a bit too much, too fast but the book is highly entertaining and hard to put down. Unfortunately, the writing style is simple and a bit blah at times but I would still recommend it to read.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I downloaded it as the free app of the day, and found it to be worth more than the cost. :)  I'd totally pay money to get more puzzles ... once I'm done with the hundreds of puzzles available. (That'll take some time.)  I'm utterly addicted.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I have read all 3 books in the fifty series and book two was my favorite out of all of them. This one goes more into Christian's past and keeps the story exciting beyond their sex lives. Yes, the writing is a bit simplistic but overall the book was very good. Book two had a better story line then the first and by the third book, you tend to have had enough. Overall, fifty shades is a great summer read!
B000002UCN|3.0|This isn't a bad CD, but the title is rather misleading, making the CD appear to be strictly a George Harrison SOLO collection when in fact it's far from it. This is really more of a \\"Beatles-era George\\" compilation, as 7 of the 13 tracks are ones that he recorded with the Beatles!<br />Granted, the Beatles tracks (which make up what I assume was side one of the original record) do include many of George's best compositions from that period: \\"Something\\" (naturally), \\"Here Comes The Sun,\\" \\"If I Needed Someone,\\" \\"Taxman,\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" I don't care so much for \\"Think For Yourself\\" or \\"For You Blue,\\" but they're not bad.<br />The SOLO George tracks are \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" \\"Give Me Love,\\" \\"What Is Life,\\" \\"Bangla-Desh,\\" \\"You,\\" and \\"Dark Horse.\\" I think the first three are the best of the those tracks. (The songs on the CD don't appear in the exact order I listed them in.)<br />I agree with the folks who think this CD is too short on solo tracks. Apparently, this comp first came out in '76, but even at that time, there were also many other good solo George recordings (especially from All Things Must Pass) that Capitol could have included; they could have put out a good (or even great) George Harrison collection without resorting to the usage of ANY tracks that are technically Beatles recordings.<br />However, this is, as far as I know, the only CD that includes material from George's Beatles years as well as from his solo career; if you want a CD that features both \\"Beatle George\\" and \\"solo George,\\" it may be better than nothing at all, but you may still find the comp too short-sighted (at least solo career-wise) even for 1976.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever I have been waiting for it on kindle fire for ever its so addicting
1451627289|5.0|I can not say enough about this book. I am always reading and this was one of my top five.I did not want to put it down or for it to end.If you want to read a great book this is it. For those of you another good book is \\"The Passage\\"by Justin Cronin. Jeremy Robinson is a new author,very good. Cannot forget Stephen Kings \\"The Dome\\",also a very good book. Enjoy

B007ZD17XO|5.0|the graphics are great and the variety of power ups make this a fun and interesting game. you won't get bored with this one!
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Read the various reviews here on Amazon and you'll find that, for the most part, people were either very impressed or incredibly bored with THE WOMAN IN BLACK. Put me in the former category for I love a good ghost story and there are way too few of them these days especially in the movies. THE WOMAN IN BLACK does exactly what it sets out to do, give Daniel Radcliffe an adult post-HARRY POTTER role and craft (that word is key to the proceedings) an old school Victorian style ghost story in the tradition of M. R. James (if you don't know the name, Google him. It will explain a lot).<br /><br />I have never read Susan Hill's book nor been able to jet over to London to see the long running play but I do have the 1989 TV-Movie that was adapted by Nigel Kneale (of QUATERMASS fame) on VHS. That version stars Adrian Rawlings who, ironically, would play Harry Potter's father James in the HP movies. I liked that version very much but have read elsewhere that the author didn't care for it. Apparently there are wholesale changes in that version including giving the characters different names. It was well done for a TV film with one very effective jump-out-of-your-skin moment.<br /><br />Back to this newest incarnation which is a co-production of the recently revived Hammer Films whose earler efforts (THE RESIDENT, WAKE WOOD, LET ME IN) have met with limited success. This WOMAN IN BLACK restores the characters' names and is apparently closer to what the author intended as she has given this version her blessing. However it too has its own share of differences including changing the central character into a widower with a young son and beefing up a character (Janet McTeer) who somehow has a link to the beyond.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with the plot of the film, here it is. Young solicitor Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), whose wife died giving birth, is sent to a remote English village to tidy up the affairs of a recently deceased woman. Once there he is greeted with hostility by the locals and is befriended by the local squire (Ciarin Hinds). Staying in the decaying house that was her home, he is subject to strange sounds and visions that include a woman in mourning and a number of dead children. These are the children of the villagers who are systematically being driven to kill themselves by this woman. After arriving at a solution Kipps hopes to implement it and stop the strange goings on.<br /><br />Director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman have carefully crafted an old school ghost story with all the classic elements. There are sudden sounds, quick cuts, and an effective music score that help to deliver some genuine shocks. There is even a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film that runs for half an hour without any dialogue which will either have you on the edge of your seat or will put you to sleep depending on how you respond to it. After you have watched the film, watch it again with Watkins' and Goldman's bonus commentary and you can see exactly how well crafted the film is. The performances by all concerned, not just the principals, are all first rate and this only adds to the overall impact.<br /><br />The one sequence of the film that I didn't like is the ending. I won't give it away but it forgoes the central element of the Victorian ghost story and that is the power of redemption. Once the wrong has been righted, the results should have been different. It is possible to interpret the ending as a thank you gift of sorts but in the commentary the filmmakers state what they intended and it is that which I disagree with. Nevertheless I found THE WOMAN IN BLACK to be top drawer entertainment and I plan to return to it on several occasions. It can take its place along with THE HAUNTING (1963), THE CHANGELING (1979 - George C. Scott not Angelina), and THE OTHERS (2001) as one of the handful of great cinematic ghost story adaptations.lity by the locals and is befriended by the local squire (Ciarin Hinds).

After arriving at a solution Kipps hopes to implement it and stop the strange goings on.<br /><br />Director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman have carefully crafted an old school ghost story with all the classic elements. There are sudden sounds, quick cuts, and an effective music score that help to deliver some genuine shocks. There is even a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film that runs for half an hour without any dialogue which will either have you on the edge of your seat or will put you to sleep depending on how you respond to it. After you have watched the film, watch it again with Watkins' and Goldman's bonus commentary and you can see exactly how well crafted the film is. The performances by all concerned, not just the principals, are all first rate and this only adds to the overall impact.<br /><br />The one sequence of the film that I didn't like is the ending. I won't give it away but it forgoes the central element of the Victorian ghost story and that is the power of redemption. Once the wrong has been righted, the results should have been different. It is possible to interpret the ending as a thank you gift of sorts but in the commentary the filmmakers state what they intended and it is that which I disagree with. Nevertheless I found THE WOMAN IN BLACK to be top drawer entertainment and I plan to return to it on several occasions. It can take its place along with THE HAUNTING (1963), THE CHANGELING (1979 - George C. Scott not Angelina), and THE OTHERS (2001) as one of the handful of great cinematic ghost story adaptations.
B0086700CM|5.0|ITS FINNALY HERE!  I love this game so much .. I was estatic when I saw it in the app store!  THANK YOU!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its a very cool and stratistic game and its a learning yet enjoyable game. you should really think about getting the game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting soooooo long for this app on kindle fire...ive tried everything to download it before and now its finally on the kindle fire!!!!! thank you!!!!! This is the best app EVER.
B004PGO25O|5.0|There is not too many books that get to the point and explain why simplicity is truth in its most honest form...Do the work is the mantra for anyone wanting to achieve the semblance of success...whatever that is for you at this time and place...and when it is needed later...because you will need it again and again....the words...Do the Work...will ring strong.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Humans finally realize that they are not alone. They share their world with non-humans in the form of lycans and vampires. A tremendous fear starts a war of extermination with the humans fighting to reclaim their world. The humans call it \\"The Cleansing\\" and the non-humans call it \\"the Purge\\".<br /><br />What follows is a story of capture and experimentation to find an antidote to the viruses that cause the changing of mankind into the lycans or the vampires. But whose side are the doctors really working on?????<br /><br />This is a good story and it is really well written. It is nonstop action and it features some very good fight scenes and outstanding special effects. This is a very good continuation of the Underworld saga and if you liked the first movies you will like this one also.<br /><br />My only negatives are why everything has to be filmed in the dark or with flickering lights. This effect is being used by so many Directors today and I hate it. I paid to see what is going one and not get a headache from flashing lights. I know that darkness generates suspense but it is simply overdone,<br /><br />Overall it is a good movie and worth seeing and it does leave you hanging for, of course, another movie sequel!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am always playing temple run on my dads phone and now I can play it on fire. Thank you Imangi Studios!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I been waiting for a long time and now I don't have to borrow my friends to play this game
B004X60QE2|5.0|Eureka was recommended to us by our son. We have finished the first two seasons and into the third.  There is a delightful mix of off-beat characters and situations that we find very entertaining.
B004W89N72|3.0|Decent calendar, but it's isolated. If it synced with Google calendar. I've found better apps that fit my calendar needs.
B004EPZ03O|3.0|A good movie, if you like the Muppets character.  Perhaps our expectations for it were too high, but we didn't think it quite lived up to our memories of Muppets past.  It was good for fans, but not great.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Awesome explanation of fruit ninja. My wife is constantly stealing my phone and seeing new high scores. I should have had her download it while it was free.<br />Awesome fun slicing game. Great challenge mode and my wife loves the endless Desperado, survival mode. Also quite a few unlockables.

B004LZF2LW|4.0|Neat clock. I especially like the globe / map display of timezones. I don't have need of it, but a nice tool if you're looking for a fancy clock or trying to figure out a timezone.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|It's not a 5 star movie in the classic sense, but I felt like this was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. (I don't watch many)<br /><br />The performances stole the show, wow what a cast! All were great, Brad Pitt was never better. Diane Kruger role as Bridget von Hammersmark, had me wondering out loud, who is this wonderful actress? The tavern scene was dynamic moviemaking!<br /><br />There is needless gore which I remember hearing about with QT's films, however it somehow all fits with the rogue element that the Inglorious Bastards unit represents. I mean what do you expect? It's war. Overall high recommendation!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Just as many other reviews say: where is the live wallpaper? Very cool looking to play with the stars and all, but... I don't want to open an app to swirl around a galaxy of stars.<br />Perhaps Samsung should look into this as a live wallpaper for all Galaxy devices.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen ... I feel cheated at the $1.99 special streaming sale price.  When am I going to learn to read reviews BEFORE I watch a movie????????  Acting sucked .the sets were dark and confusing ..A lot of money was spent on making this but it was all in vane......Bad story  could not follow  and Nothing like the  original BBC story .....  Please if you have any respect for acting  do not watch this movie.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Nice app with a calendar showing the phases of the moon. Good for predicting lunar events. Not for me. I'm only going to look up information on the moon once in a blue moon, so I'll just search it on the Web. No use toting around an app, even if it is a good one.
0470901071|5.0|It worked. I passed the test from studying this book.<br /><br />It's VERY easy to read compared to the Cisco Press book and the review questions really give you an idea of your weaknesses. The flash cards and CD material are also awesome. I passed the test easily.<br /><br />-Adam, CCNA
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you like Quell, you'll love Quell reflect!  The puzzles are entertaining and addicting!  If you get stuck on a puzzle you can always buy the answer as a last resort.
B0086700CM|5.0|to get this app on the appetite: just type &quot;temple&quot; in the search bar under &quot;apps for aneroid&quot;. then change the search type instead of by revelance, to popularity. it was the 4th one down for me. hope I helped! love this game!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Les Meserables The 25th Anniversary Concert in Blue-ray was AMAZING!!!!!  It was a GREAT VALUE for the money we spent on the DVD.  I am so glad we purchased this special edition.  Not only were the singers FANTASTIC, you could feel the electricity from the audience.  In the end, all the previous companies come out and treat the audience to more and more music.  It was just fabulous; the next best thing to being there!
0345803493|5.0|I loved Anne Rices Beauty series and while this doesn't delve near as deep into the BDSM culture it's fantastic reading.  Mrs James is very descriptive in her writing, and her coy little comments makes you smile throughout the book.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|RUN LIKE THE WIND. This game is truly awesome. If you are a Sonic fan this game is perfect for you. Lots of powerups. TO RECAP THIS GAME IS AMAZING
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some of the best books I've read in my lifetime. Gorgeous, immersive plot - giving just enough away to keep you guessing and wanting to read more. I've recommended this series to all of my friends (mainly because I haven't stopped talking about it!) and will definitely pick up more from this amazingly talented author. Wow. Wow. Wow.
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best but loading is to long so play it anyway its the best! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so play temple run
0345803485|4.0|Against my better judgement I bought into the '50 Shades of Grey' hoopla and read the book.  I'm glad I did. The author says she was inspired to write this trilogy after reading the 'Twilight' books, I can see why.  Any adult woman who's read Twilight is itching for more than a chaste kiss or implied sex act after finishing the saga.  Fifty Shades of Grey fulfills that want, plus some.  I was worried because of some of the bad reviews citing horrendous writing, a drawn out plot line and lackluster characters, but I didn't find any of the previous when I read this book.  Did I get sick of hearing the same phrases over and over, yes, but that happens with most books.  Did I feel like my IQ jumped a few points after reading, or that I needed a dictionary to traverse the pages, no.  But I also didn't feel embarrassed when I walked into my local Barnes and Noble and purchased this, like I would have had I reached for a book plastered with a shirtless man masquerading as a \\"romance novel\\".  The sex scenes were tactfully written, and hot, and isn't that what we're looking for by reading this book?  I connected with the characters and genuinely wanted to see how their story developed, which led me to buy the other books in the series, so job well done Ms. James.  I laughed out loud a few times, and my jaw hit the floor at others.  It is entertaining, scintillating, very grown up.  It's not hardcore BDSM, more like a sprinkling, so if you're looking for a really raw dominant/submissive novel look elsewhere, but overall I'd definitely recommend this series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great<br />I love this game it is just like Mario and I loved that game too so it makes this game better
B0086700CM|5.0|I saw this on the app store and I was totally freaking out I was like Omg Omg Omg and I could not wait to play it

B0086700CM|3.0|It is ok but the game starts to lag a lot if you play the game very much, and on my kindle fire the game starts to get harder at the begginning the more I play it.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|This is one addictive game...you can play for hours and with the many levels you will not be bored...they get really hard and much more challenging as you progress..have fun!
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Great movie, that will be around for years! This is a movie that can be watched many times. It has its highs and lows, but has a introspective lesson.
0741470314|5.0|Because of this well-written book, I now have a more in-depth understanding of the daily overwhelming but also extremely exciting life of this amazing entertainer/young man<br />whose music has always had such a special place in my heart!<br />READ THIS BOOK; YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so awesome.,....It had me hooked just in a few mins.....I. play castlevile on facebook so I thought why not give this a try....I just love Disney movies...Plus the graphics are awesome...Iwould recamend this game to anyone.. Jzust try it....smiles
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting a while for this and now I can finally play it on my kindle. Good job guys you finally got the real temple run on here instead of just a knock-off like &quot;temple rum&quot;  :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The first book set the tone for an upsetting, disturbing series. Despite this, I couldn't stop reading even though I figured things would only get increasingly \\"difficult\\" for the main characters. This last novel was certainly an uphill battle, but I loved it. I loved the resolutions of the characters, story, setting, everything. I wish there were more books like these out there; it's one of those stories that leaves an emptiness when it's finished.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally :D I've been waiting for them to get this game! its so addicting &lt;3333 I love it (: definatly worth downloading :D
B0086700CM|4.0|It's here yes! I did see a couple of problems 1.it slides to fast 2.they work to hard to have twist and turns all over<br />the place. Other than that. I LOVE it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the game just needs to be able to friend people... I keep playing like 20 times a day and no friend update please fix it!!! id like to get that quest over with.... my sister plays too so id like to visit hers. scrat is my favorite I cant wait till the next movie comes out.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I heard a segment on the radio about Fifty Shades of Grey being a good Mother's day present. Women rang up and said it was really racy and gave it rave reviews.  All of them sited \\"Chapter 8\\" as being the most amazing sex they had read. After that I just had to read it to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I downloaded it and started on the journey.  The first few chapters were poorly written but I gave James the benefit of the doubt and ploughed on though the banal descriptions of how hot Christian is (we get it, don't mention it on every page), ploughed on through the cringeworthy factor of a  so-called dominant ...or really anyone over the age of 13 saying \\"laters, baby\\".  Ploughed on, like a champion, through the excruciatingly boring emails (you're using emails to drive the narrative? Really?) and ploughed on through the lip biting and obsession with food and repetitive phrases, too numerous for a published author (for the love of God, get a thesaurus!), all with the promise of knowing that Chapter 8 would make up for it.  An hour or so later I randomly checked my progress and realised I was at Chapter 10.  Apparently I'd already read through the \\"hot bit\\" and didn't even know it!<br /><br />Be under no illusions Dear Readers, this book is terribly written. It makes Twilight look like Anna Karenina and that is saying a lot since it started as Twilight fan-fiction (if that isn't enough to put you off then you cannot be saved, good luck to you).  I've read stories by 5th Graders with more character development and narrative drive than this.  I can't believe that it's actually a published book!  Bad writing aside, this author also makes the rookie mistake of not knowing anything about her topic.  It was not believable at all.  A dominant would never behave so erratically or less like a dominant!  I mean, he can barely control a 21 year old, it's embarrassing!  I have a problem with him being only 27 as well.  How can we take a 27 year old dominant seriously? Oh that's right, we can't.  Not even Bella..I mean, Ana can.  She is the worst, most annoying, uninteresting submissive ever written.<br /><br />I have nothing good to say about this book.  The characters were boring and unbelievable, there was no real drive in the plot, the vocabulary was repetitive and droll, the sex scenes were pretty much vanilla (not kinky at all) and these two characters together make up the worst examples of dominant and submissive I have ever read in \\"literature\\".  In fact, I have read Facebook posts with more substance than this book.  I despair for Pauline Réage, The Marquis de Sade, Anne Rice and other brave authors who have written about this topic in the past.  This book is fifty shades of badly written banality.<br /><br />Laters, baby.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been getting bord with all my other apps and that they put this on their and I said YESSS.........!
B003JIM9G8|5.0|Definitely need to have in your DC movie collection. It's been too long since I've seen an animated movie this good. Brings 'A Death in the Family' back to life for a more modern generation. I just finished watching it and I'm pretty sure I'll be watching it again tomorrow.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so awesome. I<br />love how they got it on the kindle fire. I cant wait until I get a really really high score
B0086700CM|5.0|I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS APP TO GO TO THE ANDROID STORE!! The only thing I've ever gotten is that other stupid game but now I have the real thing!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read this trilogy in a week.  The first book kept me wanting more, as soon as I was done I started the second, only to be disappointed by the third.  Mockingjay felt rushed, I had to keep rereading paragraphs just to try to keep up with what was going on.  I agree with other's reviews about Katniss' depression and her giving up on everything was really not her.  This character was a fighter from the start and she was broken so easily in the third book.  Just didn't seem like the same character.  I love a happy ending but I felt so sorry for Peeta's character in the end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book will definitely snap you out of a dull love life!  Wow, talk about hot and sexy!  Better than any fantasy or day dream I could've ever come up with.  Whether you're a freak or not, this book will wake you up!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am sooooooooo happy that this game finally came out on the kindle fire I was waiting for soooooo long and am overjoyed to finally have it.
1878424114|5.0|This book is a more specific teaching that has assisted me greatly.  As in most things in life, finding the discipline to incorporate the teachings takes a little changing of old habits.  Love this book!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very fun and interesting there is nothing bad about this app. I have been wating for it to come to the kindel fire fore a very long time.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This is going to be great! I ordered 4 copies of this dvd so I can do a worldwide giveaway! 3 dvds for the winners and 1 for myself of course! Throwing an Up All Night house party with the screening of the movie/concert! Excited.
B0086700CM|5.0|thank u amazon we finally have the real one instead of temple rum and ruin u finally did something right
0345803507|1.0|Like another poster, I too \\"hate-read\\" this series...mostly. I fully read book one, read 75% of the words in book two but could only stomach 40% of the words in book three.  Now, to be clear I finished each, I just quick turned the pages when I realized I was reading a scene AGAIN.  Therein lies my biggest issue with these books - repetition!  Over and over and over, the same thing happens.  Also, this is NOT erotica, it just is not; nor does this come close to a good BDSM book and they are out there.  I was surprise at the blandness of the supposed \\"erotic\\" sex - Johanna Lindsey books cir 1987 are frankly racier and have more bondage.  This is written in first person, which is a very difficult POV for a weak writer.  Don't fall prey to the hype, this book is not good, the writing is below average, the style is very poor and it is unimaginative...oh and the boring story is WAY tooooooooooo long, one book would have been plenty - three is just mean.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I can't say that many movies make me cry, but this one did! it has great acting and is such a heartwarming story. I gave this to my mother for Mother's Day and she loved it. I'ts definitely a film worth watching.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|This is the second cinematic adaptation of Susan Hill's novel of the same name (the last was made in 1989), this one written for the screen by Jane Goldman and directed by James Watkins. As with many British ghost stories (termed Horror, Drama, Thriller by the press) the themes remain the same - just the locales and the names of the characters change. Not that that is a bad thing, but it is nothing novel and if such stories are your cup of tea - shadowy images in darkened house windows, incidental dead children, a suspicious group of townspeople, a lots of candles flickering out because of mysterious doors opening and closing at will - then this incarnation will please.  There is very little dialogue and very little character development, but the locations are magnificent, the cinematography is glorious (Tim Maurice Jones) and the musical score (Marco Beltrami) is chilling. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an elegantly creepy, atmospheric, British period style ghost story.<br /><br />When a friendless old widow dies in the seaside town of Crythin, young solicitor Arthur Krips (Daniel Radcliffe), who lives with his four-year old son Joseph (Misha Handley) - Arthur's wife Stella (Sophie Stuckey) died in childbirth) - and Joseph's Nanny (Jessica Raine), is sent by his firm to settle the estate. Arthur finds the townspeople reluctant to talk about or go near the woman's dreary home and no one will explain or even acknowledge the fact that he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is no filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame. Ignoring the towns-people's cryptic warnings (they are trying to conceal a deadly secret), he goes to the house where he discovers its horrible history and becomes ensnared in its even more horrible legacy.<br /><br />Along the way Arthur is befriended by Dailey (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) and his strange insane wife (Janet McTeer) and Dailey is the only man willing to transport Arthur across the tide covered marshes to the haunted estate. The story is basically dealing with life after death - in the person of ghosts who stay around to wreck vengeance for their deaths - and the many events that suggest that indeed there is a place after death is borne out by story's strange ending.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe manages to carry his role well (the designers keep him with a fashionable 5 o'clock shadow to prove he has outgrown Harry Potter) and the subordinate cast is strong in the miniscule parts they are given.

B007FDE4Y8|2.0|Opteka is trying to get things done right... but at the end is not a quality product. First fault is that the elbow of the balance stick is tricky and therefore if you touch it or lift the weight with it, it will balance a little bit different so you will need to re-adjust the whole thing again. Mine had a weak screw to hold the section after the elbow and it got broken just by adjusting the angle.<br /><br />I have used the Glidecam HD 1000 and it's a painful experience but if you are persistent you will get it... I got this with the glidecam gear  [...] (is an actual video presentation for a development)<br /><br />I just got the Opteka because I saw the good reviews and it seemed like they got the Merlin just figure it out in a super less expensive deal... But as the logic dictates; it was just a good attempt...<br /><br />I have never used Merlin but I'm trying the get the money for it... because it seems like nothing else will give you just the right flying experience... in the US$700 or less bugdet...

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is the best written story line to come along since I read Wally Lamb's last book.  It is unpredictable, erotic (beyond belief), it is sad, happy, jarring and I cannot put it down.  We are talking about it at work, the men are intrigued and want to know more, and then again they don't.  50 Shades of Grey, chapter 8 is pivotel.  50 Shades of Dark, book two, chapter 14 is pivotel.  I hope that Miss James continues this story line and equally hopeful that HBO picks this up to make it into a movie/series because no one else will do it justice by avoiding the eroticism that goes on between Christian and Anastasia.  I don't so much recommend it for my girls who are in their 20's, but any woman who is 35+ should be reading this book.  For those of you that don't experiment, it might light a fire under your cute butt, for those of you that do, it might give you some added spice to your already thrilling sex life.  I will be sad when I finally get through book 3.
0345529057|5.0|This series is a consistent entry on the NY Times Best Seller list, no small achievement for a medieval world.<br />This is a very popular series of books with a large and faithful following. Additionally, HBO has started filming the books adding to their popularity.<br />This a huge multi-character story set in a medieval type world where some magic might work. The author tells the story in chapters dedicated to a character.<br />We see the world through their perspective colored by their problems. This is a very effective way to tell the story.<br />It allows the reader to follow multiple people and stories with very few problems and almost no backtracking.<br /><br />The books are huge each is about 1,000 pages more or less.<br />I never found that a problem as each is a \\"page turner\\". This is the least expensive way to buy the first four books.<br />The slipcase keeps them together nicely. Buying the books in hardbacks or large trade paperbacks is much more expensive.<br />This is an on-going series! Book 6 is only available as a hardback in May 2012.<br />If you wish to keep a matched set of these books, that is a consideration.<br /><br />Whatever set you pick, however much you spend, this is a very enjoyable read.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|HBO brings The Song of Ice and Fire to the screen in a faithful adaptation that should please all but the pickiest fans.<br />The acting and casting does justice to the book.  The storyline is kept intact.<br /><br />Be advised, this is not for children.  The story is for adults, about adults.<br /><br />This is a tale of intrigue betrayal and murder.  It is full of bloody violence and sex.<br />HBO added nothing to the original story in this area.  Many of the characters and NOT nice people.<br /><br />\\"When you play the game of thornes, you win or you die.\\"

0061478784|4.0|Originally published in 1986 Howl's Moving Castle tells the story of Sophie Hatter, a young woman working in a hat shop in the little town of Market Chipping, in the magical kingdom of Ingary. Early on in the story Sophie is transformed into an old crone by a powerful witch, and as a result leaves the town, ultimately becoming the cleaning lady for the notorious wizard Howl in his moving / hovering castle, where she meets not only Howl, but also Michael, his apprentice and Calcifer, his fire demon with whom Sophie makes an important pact.<br /><br />What's good about it:<br />The book contains superb creations of imagination: the moving castle itself with its portals to other words, the fire demon Calcifer, seven-league boots, invisibility cloaks, living scarecrows, talking animals, and spells which can go comically wrong among other things all combine to make the book an entertaining read.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones used the portal to modern Wales in a way that reminded me of the wizard-world hidden among everyday muggles in Harry Potter, and I liked it for the same reason. It explores the idea that there is more than what we, in our world, can see and experience. Maybe it's possible that there are magical worlds out there that we are completely unaware of and if we just opened our eyes we could be introduced to wonders we had never imagined. It's an idea I loved and dreamed about constantly as a child, as an adult I can reconnect with those feelings through books such as this one.<br /><br />The writing flows well and is easy to read and understand. She doesn't use excessive amounts of description, which I think allows readers to use their own imaginations, something that can only be a good thing in a children's book!<br /><br />What's not so good about it:<br />I found the behaviour and motives of some of the characters - Sophie in particular, to be unrealistic. She seems to be completely ok with the fact that she has just been aged about 50 years in a couple of minutes and makes few attempts to change or to be changed back. Her personality also deteriorates as she is aged and she becomes almost a stereotypical grumpy old woman who hits things with her walking stick and mutters to herself about her housemates (Sophie does reflect herself on her personality change so I assume that it was a part of the spell, however, regardless of that I didn't enjoy Sophie as an old woman as much as I did Sophie as a young woman).<br /><br />All in all:<br />A good read, entertaining and amusing, although not laugh-out-loud funny. This was the first book of Diana Wynne Jones's which I have read and it did encourage me to go looking for more of her works.

B002SW8Y2E|5.0|No need for summary of story which has been adequately summarised by others. Just to say I judge a book by how much I look forward to picking it up each time and this book ticked that box big time. An excellent insight into the paranoia and secrecy that ordinary Russians lived with during the soviet era as well as a thrilling murder hunt...flawed characters that one still liked and empathised with throughout the story. Only small criticism is that the ending was (slightly) cliched and happy every afterish. But overall an excellent and exciting book that I found difficult to put down until the end.

As Lord Neuberger mentions in the Foreword, the book provides `a practical guide to the way in which the courts have developed the law of privacy in the past decade or so'.<br /><br />Underlying all these developments is of course, the perennial clash - tug of war, actually- between privacy and freedom of expression.  Personally, we favour the latter over the former and, certainly there isn't a journalist out there who doesn't... and few lawyers who don't!  But whatever side of the fence you're on, you would be more than interested in this book, whether you are seeking or opposing a privacy injunction.<br /><br />Unlike many authors of law books, Iain Goldrein takes an expansive and extensive approach to a body of subject matter which actually affects all of us.  The book, he says `seeks to meet the demands of the court and litigators, whilst securing sufficient clarity for a broader audience' which would certainly include everyone from litigants in person to those generally interested in the subject to -- above all -- journalists.<br /><br />Referring to journalists as `the watchdogs of the freedoms of our society,' Goldrein furnishes a quote from Lord Judge, who, commenting on a case in 2010, has reminded us that `very few citizens can scrutinize the judicial process; that scrutiny is performed by the media...acting behalf of the body of citizens.  Without the commitment of an independent media the operation of the principle of open justice would be irremediably diminished'.<br /><br />With the aim of reach a wider audience very much in mind, Goldrein delivers the erudite and insightful content of the book in a clear and accessible manner.  From the typography itself to the logical layout, to the clarity of the writing, this book, of over 1,200 pages, certainly offers a number of attributes calculated to extend its appeal not just to lawyers and academics but to the wider public.<br /><br />To aid further research as well as enhance ease of use, the book provides among other materials, a user's guide and at least twenty-seven pages of cases and of legislation.  There are several checklists and quality control protocols, including - Ah! - a checklist for journalists!  For media folk, media lawyers or anyone else seeking information and practical guidance in this rapidly developing area of law, this book is a useful acquisition. The publication date is 2012.dependent media the operation of the principle of open justice would be irremediably diminished'.<br /><br />With the aim of reach a wider audience very much in mind, Goldrein delivers the erudite and insightful content of the book in a clear and accessible manner.

They exit in few countries, he adds -- and he would probably also comment that in Europe, they are a relatively new idea which has certainly engendered some controversy and debate.<br /><br />The sub-title `Lessons from America' will be of special interest to lawyers, legal scholars and theorists outside the US, as well as within it.  The book is a collection of articles and essays from legal scholars and academics mainly from Europe, with the commentary focusing primarily upon the power and limitations of class actions and their applicability in European civil law jurisdictions.<br /><br />`Some 15 years ago, `says Mikko Valimaki in his article on class actions in Finland, `the idea of class actions was something new in Europe.'  In Finland itself, `partisan claims on class action cases in the United States and their potential implications to companies were used as a strong argument to restrict the law's scope of application.'<br /><br />The result apparently in Finland (one of the few European countries that have maintained its financial stability) is that `...the law can be applied (there) only in civil litigation in cases between consumers and businesses.'<br /><br />This, of course, is only one example of dozens of interesting insights in this scholarly examination of the efficacy and efficiency of class actions.  The book is certainly an important comparative study and a welcome addition to the body of scholarship on this particular legal procedure.<br /><br />Lawyers, post-graduate students of law and economics, as well as policy makers and judges concerned with the issues raised by class actions will find this book, with its copious footnotes, a valuable tool for further research into this emerging area of law...the law can be applied (there) only in civil litigation in cases between consumers and businesses.'<br /><br />This, of course, is only one example of dozens of interesting insights in this scholarly examination of the efficacy and efficiency of class actions.

0857939157|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2HQROAP3SKCG3]]<br /><br />A NEW FIELD FOR THE FUTURE?<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Innovation - the continuing search for the new and commercially viable - is a prime mover in robust economies.  Countries which don't innovate either stagnate, or imitate.  The more active and forward looking generally attempt the latter, often quite successfully.  But fundamentally it's innovation which keeps markets and economies moving.<br /><br />This book, recently published by Edward Elgar Publishing, is an overview of the most significant and seminal articles and essays on the law and economics of innovation.<br /><br />It's worth noting, as editor Eli Salzberger admits, that this is a real challenge, because there's no established legal branch of innovation law as such yet; neither is there apparently an agreed upon theory of innovation so we are breaking new ground here.  However, if anything points the way to such an eventuality, it's probably this book.<br /><br />The Law and Economics of Innovation can be described as a compendium of 22 articles -- all, we would say, judiciously selected from such institutions, publications and publishers as, for example, The Columbia Law Review... Blackwells... Oxford University Press... the Yale Journal on Regulation... Journal of Law and Economics... Cambridge Journal of Economics -- and here's one that caught our eye -- `Technovation'.<br /><br />The articles are grouped logically under six subject areas which constitute the six parts of the book.  The bulk of the book focuses on the economics of innovation, then goes on to explore such topics as intellectual property, anti-trust, torts and regulation.  The latter includes an interesting article on `The Role of the FDA in Innovation'.<br /><br />Of even more popular interest should be the intellectual property article from the Virginia Law Review which examines in depth the technicalities of `The Piracy Paradox', primarily in the fashion industry worldwide, in which innovative designs (even brands nowadays) are shamelessly pirated by certain enterprises in certain emerging economies which we have alluded to earlier.  A well known example is the formerly ubiquitous Ugg Boot (on page 529 Figure H), which, as a frequently pirated product, quickly morphed from hot item to history in about two years, although some by now might regard it as a classic.<br /><br />As we've tried to indicate, this is a book which covers a broad range of issues within this rather fascinating and topical area of inquiry. Although targeted mainly at law and economics students and scholars, it should also interest commercial, corporate and IP lawyers, as well as economic theorists.  Extensively footnoted, it opens up any number of avenues for further research and is, of course, an innovation in itself!e Piracy Paradox', primarily in the fashion industry worldwide, in which innovative designs (even brands nowadays) are shamelessly pirated by certain enterprises in certain emerging economies which we have alluded to earlier.

0857936603|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3NS0XPCMWJ9BV]]<br /><br />TO LEGAL SCHOLARS, ACADEMICS AND ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN COMPETITION LAW AND COMPETITION ECONOMICS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />In this work of reference the editor, Daniel Zimmer, brings together a truly international collection of 26 learned articles from leading academics and lawyers in the field of completion law and competition economics.<br /><br />The expert contributors hail from a range of universities worldwide, from Harvard University and Yale Law School to Laval University in Canada, the University of Haifa, the Max Planck Institute in Germany, Mejii University in Tokyo and, interestingly, the American Antitrust Institute in the United States.<br /><br />These, of course. are only a few examples of the wide range of opinion and comment contained in this book on matters pertaining to competition law. Daniel Zimmer, the editor, is a Professor of Law from the University of Bonn and Member of the German Monopolies Commission.<br /><br />It was Zimmer who organized the ASCOLA conference at the University of Bonn in 2010 at which this selection of papers was presented. (For ASCOLA read Academic Society for Competition Law).<br /><br />Significantly, we're perusing this book just after `Europe Day' May 9th which commemorates a now little known and seldom remarked upon event in the development of the European Community as a group of nations dedicated to - basically - fair trade.<br /><br />We refer to the Schumann Declaration launched some 60 years ago by the same Robert Schumann who was instrumental in founding the European Coal and Steel Community, from which the European Economic Community evolved and which in turn led to the advent of the present European Union (EU).<br /><br />The original aim of the EEC, one must recall, centered on establishing equal rights in the competition for trade.  This means that trading nations and individual traders should each have a fair crack of the whip when selling things - the basis of any market economy.<br /><br />The lessons we are learning and have learnt in Europe over the past few decades will no doubt impact upon and influence many an emerging economy in the wider global context.<br /><br />This book, based on the ASCOLA conference (chaired by Louis Kaplow of Harvard University) poses a number of questions relating to completion and specifically, competition law, two of which centre on the concept of `freedom to compete' and on distributional fairness as a goal of competition law.<br /><br />Particularly interesting is the final article by the editor which asks -- to cite just one example -- whether or not `competition' means `efficiency'.  This, of course, is debatable and all the more interesting for that.<br /><br />Published recently by Edward Elgar, this book, with its economics-based approach and international orientation, will certainly interest academic lawyers, graduate students and indeed policy makers whose decisions may affect the economic welfare of whole regions.  With detailed footnotes and index, the compilation is also especially useful as a gateway to further research.rs should each have a fair crack of the whip when selling things - the basis of any market economy.<br /><br />The lessons we are learning and have learnt in Europe over the past few decades will no doubt impact upon and influence many an emerging economy in the wider global context.<br /><br />This book, based on the ASCOLA conference (chaired by Louis Kaplow of Harvard University) poses a number of questions relating to completion and specifically, competition law, two of which centre on the concept of `freedom to compete' and on distributional fairness as a goal of competition law.<br /><br />Particularly interesting is the final article by the editor which asks -- to cite just one example -- whether or not `competition' means `efficiency'.

By far, this has to be one of the best debut album from any artist, as 4 of the 5 singles hit #1, and all 5 singles were top 5 in the charts. I don't know the history of singles hitting the charts from a debut album, but I must say, Kylie's debut album was a home-run.

B004EPZ00M|5.0|I like Rowan Atkinson in everything I have seen him -[[ASIN:0140280359 Blackadder: The Whole Damn Dynasty: 1485-1917]], [[ASIN:1842226568 Mr. Bean's Diary (The Adventures of Mr. Bean)]] as well as [[ASIN:B000QXDD2I Rowan Atkinson Live!]]. I enjoyed the first Johnny English movie[[ASIN:B00005JM20 Johnny English (Widescreen Edition)]]. So I was already prejudiced on favor of this movie.<br /><br />I don't really think it's fair to compare Peter Sellers' [[ASIN:B0001AG01M The Pink Panther Film Collection (The Pink Panther / A Shot in the Dark / Strikes Again / Revenge of / Trail of the Pink Panther)]] films with the Johnny English films. They are different kinds of comics. So if you buy this film thinking \\"Ah, Peter Sellers\\" you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />You probably know the basic story. A disgraced spy, studying in Tibet, gets  a call from MI7 to come back to the fold, he's the only one that can do the job. Surprised and pleased, he goes back to England to find about the job. Apparently an assassination is being planned and a former agent knows all the info will only talk to Johnny English.<br /><br />Of course, you know there will be double agents, pratfalls, physical comedy and to me, much fun. But the thing I don't understand is why they have Gillian Anderson [[ASIN:B000EXDS3E The X-Files: The Complete Eighth Season]]  as the head of MI7? I am sure the UK has plenty of actresses looking for work. And I am not a big fan of Gillian Anderson's acting. I guess they put her in the movie for the American audience (they didn't have to for me). But even with her in the film, I still liked it.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a fun way to spend almost 2 hours, buy this movie - you'll enjoy it.

1451648537|4.0|This book is long, but it reads fast and is engaging.  It will make you think.  I really enjoyed learning  so many about the life of Steve Jobs.  It really is amazing to think what kind of difference he made in the world.  He wasn't a figure head CEO.  His name is on over 200 pattens.  My biggest takeaway, however, was his commitment, passion, and pursuit of excellence.  Accountability mattered and was strictly enforced at Apple by Jobs not only because excellence was the standard, but because Steve cared so much about the products his company produced.  I don't think you can really become excellence at something over the long haul if you don't care an awful lot.<br /><br />Yes, Steve Jobs was selfish, self-absorbed, and his honesty was often interpreted as rudeness.  However, in his drive to make a difference--to \\"change the world\\" as he put it in his early 20's-- was something he actually did on a large scale.  I think anyone can change the world in a positive way if they are focused on doing things that matter with excellence.  I certainly know that teachers can and frequently do change the world for their students, and if we all did our part on that front, the world would be a better place.  Inspire someone today.

B006VFLIYK|3.0|Not his best. Very limited and predictable content. Wishing for more of the \\"Camel Club like characters\\" and story lines.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The Kindle fire is a great product. I got it with a clam shell cover. The cover protects the screen and is great for travel. There are many books that are available for the fire. It connected to my home internet very easily. There are a lot of games to allow for relaxing time.  The delivery time was rapid and the free Amazon Prime membership allow me to sample the service for one month. I highly recommend this prduct.
B004EPZ07U|2.0|I am not the most familiar person to the story of Green Lantern. Most of my knowledge comes from episodes of the Super Friends from the 1950's. My review is strictly about the movie as a movie and in that respect it failed. The editing was jumpy, the script poor, and because the script was poor the acting suffered accordingly. I skimmed some of the other reviews and one discussed how this movie was actually more trying to make fun of itself and the conventions of the super hero film. Well that's why we have movies like the Green Hornet. We can do parodies of the super hero film with those smaller lesser known characters, but if you are going to do a mainstream, 200 million dollar super-hero movie, dang man take yourself seriously! The only other movie I can think of in comparison to it is, I'm sorry to say, the infamous 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Given a budget like Lanter's and Ed Wood might have produced something similar. I'm sorry to say it but I really cannot credit this as even an 'okay' movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|after not having he game for so long finally so fun and addicting works awesome on kindle fire so fun and addicting!!!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the stupidest book I have ever read.  It is so bad I deleted it half way through.  It wasn't the porn that turned me off.  It was the stupid romance theme.  I knew it was pornographic, but thought it would have a better story.  It is like Rosemary Rogers with porn.  When she referred to her \\"inner goddess\\" for the 100th time, I realized this book was ridiculous.  I have been told the 2nd book goes into why he is like he is, but I don't think I could stomach finishing the first one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I played it on my friends iphone all the time and now I can play it on my kindle fire. great app
B0086700CM|5.0|Well, I was so surprised to find this in the app store. This is my favorite app of all time, Thanks Amazon!!!
B007NESBK2|5.0|Wonderful!  That's the only way to describe this blu-ray.  If you're a Sade fan, then this is a must have for you.  You already have that big flat screen and hooked up the theater system, well, now it's time to put it to use.  Put in the disc, pour a glass of your beverage of choice and let the party begin, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />As a side note, don't you love how Sade has proven that you don't have to follow some corporate formula or compromise yourself to achieve success.  This disc and Sade's career in general, can serve as a blue print for so many young artists (male and female) who unfortunately mistake radio play for achievement and an uncovered body for talent.  She truly raises the bar.<br /><br />Thanks Sade for two decades of wonderful music.
032147404X|5.0|I learned so much by reading this book, but what really caught me by surprise is that I actually found myself laughing out loud at the humor interspersed throughout the book.  Though I originally bought it as a reference, I actually read it cover to cover and learned a TON of stuff about digital photography.  The almost instant transformation in my photos has been breathtaking!  I cannot stress how wonderful this book is if you want to take better pictures.  I was so impressed that I even bought it for my Kindle and it goes with me as a ready reference whenever I am shooting pictures.  If you own a Kindle, this book is absolutely user-friendly for accessing different sections and I have written notes and book-marked this little gem to death.  I cannot wait to download the next book in the series as I am sure I will learn more valuable stuff and I will have a great time doing it!  Scott Kelby, this book is a homerun...

B004OFWLO0|1.0|Yet another misfire... This is NOT the best choice for listening to Robert Johnson.<br /><br />This review is for the Robert Johnson Centennial 2 CD set.<br /><br />The overall sound quality still misses the mark by a wide margin... Robert often still sounds a bit too much like he is singing in a tunnel without any real bottom end in the sound spectrum.  It did not have to turn out that way - there are better representations of this material out there.<br /><br />Yes, there is a slight improvement in this Centennial set in terms of clarity over the two previous double CD box sets, but is that really saying very much?  Both of those earlier sets sounded really bad, and neither were worthy then nor now of any sort of bench mark status - it's not difficult to improve on crap!  Unfortunately many misguided and misinformed reviewers in this forum are basing their opinions on &#34;how much better&#34; this Centennial set is compared to the 1990 set!  That is setting the bar way too low!  A more realistic bench mark would be the two separate single CD releases of &#34;The King of the Delta Blues&#34; (KOTDB, vol. 1 & 2), the first volume of which was released in 1998.  On the KOTDB CDs we got a significant breakthough in sound quality (the first breakthrough was the much earlier gold disc release).  Some of the improvement on the KOTDB CDs was due to superior source material, but a lot of it simply had to do with EQ - you could FINALLY hear ALL of the lower bass registers on the KOTDB CDs - Robert's guitar for the first time was sonically on equal footing with Robert's voice instead of being drowned out in the background - in short, the music on KOTDB gained a very full, complete and satisfying sound spectrum.  He sounded like he was finally out of the tunnel and back in the room with you.  The reviews in Amazon for KOTDB were overwhelmingly positive at the time... even celebratory.  Nobody had any complaints about the KOTDB CDs.  You could now really hear even the room ambiance of the hotel room where these were recorded.<br /><br />Then along comes this latest Centennial release and the EQ was inexplicitly re-set back to the old dinosaur position of rolling off the bass - back to square one again!  Now you can argue all day long about RIAA curves and the microphones used or even the speed of the recordings - in fact, that sort of technical discussion seems to be all that some people are interested in!  Discussions about whether the source materials included metal masters or 78s or just tapes made in 1961 of long lost sources, etc. abound.  That is all fine and well, but you have to get your facts straight.  For example, even in the liners notes of the Centennial release I note some inconsistencies in terms of the discussion at large of what sources were used for the KOTDB CD.  In the Centennial insert booklet, on pg. 23, Steven LaVere , clearly states that the selections on the KOTDB CD &#34;...were all newly transferred from original discs...&#34;  I take this to mean that KOTDB was entirely sourced directly from 78 discs... Seems like a reasonable takeaway, right?  And yet in this very forum another reviewer emphatically insisted that I was &#34;misinformed&#34; and that many of the sources for the KOTDB CDs were actually from magnetic tape copies from 1961 transfers as opposed to directly from disc. Really?  Not according to Columbia's own literature as quoted above.  Be careful... there are a lot of so-called experts out there their grinding axes.... Misinformation abounds.<br /><br />Regardless, for what it's worth, consider a different way of looking at the EQ issue.  I actually play guitar.  I even play guitars similar in size to those that Johnson was known to use.  When you palm-dampen the bass runs as Robert often does (think &#34;Sweet Home Chicago&#34;) you get a surprising amount of low-end thumping bass.  But when I heard the Centennial CD version of &#34;Ramblin' On My Mind&#34; it sounded anemic - the signature booming sound you normally would expect to hear in up front in the foreground had faded to the background - weak and anemic.  Then I listened again to the KOTDB CD for the same cut... and there it is! - the missing bass is back with much more authority.  It is almost as if there is some sort of revisionist attempt here to change Robert Johnson into something other than what he really was.  I think the recording engineers have forgotten that there was only one microphone in the room that day - one mike to pick up both the vocals and the guitar.  Now if the mike is aimed at the vocals then OF COURSE the guitar is going to suffer in the mix, but that does not mean that the EQ cannot be adjusted to compensate - there is nothing sacred about a less than optimal original feed from the microphone. Now, of course one can argue all day long about what the original microphone picked up that day in the studio and what it did not pick up, etc.  Regardless, in my opinion the guitar I heard in the KOTDB CDs sounded realistic in terms of what you would actually hear in the real world - a lot of resonating bass with a nice &#34;thunk&#34; while the Centennial set comes off as anemic. If you are not familiar with how a live guitar sounds in a hotel room you can always watch and listen to the &#34;Sessions for Robert J.&#34; DVD where Eric Clapton actually plays Robert Johnson songs in the SAME hotel room where many of the Robert Johnson recordings were actually recorded back in the 1930s.  He also does several solo Robert Johnson songs in a Santa Monica hotel room.  Does Eric's guitar sound at all bass-shy in any of these settings?  I don't think so...  EQ is something the sound engineer has to make a decision about... and it is not only about reproducing the limitations of the microphone used, you can improve on bad conditions and compensate for faulty EQ - that's their job.  In my opinion, the right decision was made for the KOTDB CDs and the wrong decision was made for the Centennial set.  You may have a different opinion, but do yourself a favor and compare the two sets side by side and listen for yourself.... forget about all the discussions about RIAA curves and microphones and see which one actually SOUNDS better.  To me KOTDB wins hands down with a superior sound spectrum.  The Centennial set loses...<br /><br />So, in summary, I will readily concede that the Centennial set managed to reduce the distortion in Robert's voice and that the overall sound is &#34;cleaner&#34;.  But, unfortunately, that slight improvement is almost completely negated by a lackluster EQ - i.e. there is hardly any mid-bass evident on this Centennial re-mastering - bass that is free for the asking on the KOTDB CDs.  Of course, any time you eliminate the bass to this extent the vocals can also SEEM to gain sharpness and clarity, but not really... it's just that the EQ brings the vocals up front by default.  You are still missing a lot of the music from the bottom end.  And, yes, I will also grant you that Columbia certainly did take out pops and crackles on this latest Centennial set - but, so what? Who really cares? There never was a lot of ticks and pops on these recordings to begin with.  Apparently four metal masters were used for the first time on CD for the Centennial set... which is great; but even the older CDs that were not direct transferred from first generation metal masters (KOTDB CDs for instance) already sounded pretty good in terms of hiss and pops - the problem was always more about distortion and EQ, not pops and ticks. Besides, if you listen to the very first cut on this Centennial set there still is a lot of hiss that was left in. No big deal one way or the other.<br /><br />Back to the bass or lack of it... even if you do attempt to compensate on the Centennial set by turning the bass knob all the way up to &#34;12&#34; you STILL are missing too much bass - it is STILL not anywhere near the bass levels on the unadjusted KOTDB CDs - that is how far off the mark the EQ on the Centennial set is!  Even fully cranking up the bass does not get this turkey up to where it should be.  Wow!  This is why I gave this set a one star.  It is also worth considering that this is the fifth time or even sixth time(!) Columbia has released a &#34;new and improved&#34; Robert Johnson collection.  In addition to this latest Centennial set there were two previous attempts at a &#34;complete&#34; two disc set - both of which were dismal failures, a gold disc that sounded great at the time and the two KOTDB CDs which seem today to be the only real breakthroughs so far in terms of the overall sound. Unfortunately this Centennial set has taken one step forward (lower distortion) and two steps back (crappy EQ - no bass).<br /><br />As a side note, here is a curious situation - the most recent Yazoo re-remaster reissues  of Charlie Patton (2010) sound perhaps even fresher and more three dimensional to my ears than this Centennial Robert Johnson set... and yet the source material for those Charlie Patton Yazoos are from really bad vinyl (some say those Patton Paramount discs were not even pressed on regular vinyl back in the 30's but instead pressed on the same material used for bowling balls!). What Yazoo was able to do with the Charlie Patton material was nothing short of miraculous. A fantastic resurrection of the music. And then compare that to this latest Centennial set from Columbia. You have to ask yourself, if the original metal masters are long lost for Charlie Patton, but Columbia has four original metal masters for Robert Johnson AND exceptionally clean sounding 78s to master from... why then do the Patton CDs sound as good or even better than the Centennial Johnson CDs? I think it is because Yazoo seems to know what they are doing.... and after five (or is it six attempts?) Columbia STILL cannot get it right.  Based upon the track record, who would you want to hire for this job?<br /><br />As I mentioned above, the only thing Columbia did do right here on this latest Robert Johnson Centennial set was to tame down some of the harshness in Robert's voice - very good job there, and you can turn up the volume more now without getting a harsh sound. But that is the only redeeming re-mastering choice made here... and the only reason you MIGHT want to purchase this set.<br /><br />So, my advice is to go back to the &#34;King of the Delta Blues&#34; CDs and stick with that. Yes, there is more hiss and noise and slightly more harshness at times in the vocals, but it is really not a problem for the listening experience and you get really FULL bass which is essential to the blues!<br /><br />Or.... your other option is to make your own personal &#34;re-master&#34; of this Centennial set.  I did this recently by using the equalizer function of a NERO-type application to narrowly boost just the low frequencies between 20hz to 800hz by about 6db.  You want to leave the high frequencies above 800hz alone as that is where Robert's tenor vocals reside and you do not need to change any of that.  Resulting CD-R gave me a very close approximation of where I think the EQ should be - again, no changes above 800hz but sharply below that point you boost everything up to +6 db.  Try it - I am very happy with the results.  If for some this results in too much bass then just back off to maybe Just +4db - it's up to you.  Perhaps your own homemade re-mastering might make this sow's ear into something worthwhile.urself a favor and compare the two sets side by side and listen for yourself.... forget about all the discussions about RIAA curves and microphones and see which one actually SOUNDS better.

B005LAIGN2|4.0|I just watched Red Tails, and I don't know if they originally intended to release it in 3D or not, but it looks fantastic in 3D.<br /><br />Lucas's stamp is all over this movie, from the dogfights (which he originally modeled the spaceship battles in Star Wars off of, even the airplane sound is reminiscent of Star Wars) to the cast of characters to the emphasis on the \\"big picture\\" both visually and in the moral and ethical focus of the characters.<br /><br />I don't have a 3D TV, so I watched it with my TV Eyes 3D glasses. The flight scenes, the vistas of the air bases and the Italian countryside, and some of the closeups really looked good. Someone on the filming crew must have had 3D experience, because it shows through in the movie. (Which is what made me wonder if they'd originally intended a 3D release.)<br /><br />The plot was a little simplistic, but it wasn't trying to explain the complexities of the whole war and it's effect on the world, simply on this one sector of it. Soldiers, men of courage laying their lives on the line for their country, when that country itself was still rife with bigotry and a blinkered view.<br /><br />Sometimes it takes something extraordinary to make people look past their assumptions, and sometimes it simply takes people being brave enough to toe the line, to get the job done, to not go for the glory, but simply to get men home alive.<br /><br />It was, for all its simplicity of focus, a moving movie, I found myself leaking tears and had to take off the glasses to wipe my eyes. The characters are not portrayed in depth, but they are portrayed as very human, so what affected them, affected me.<br /><br />A simple story told of a complex time, told with clarity and delivering its message right on target. Told in a visually beautiful style.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Even if only half of what is in this documentary is true, this is a staggering expose of the American food industry. Beyond the indefensibly cruel way we treat other living creatures is the realization of that our own craving for cheap, fast food is undermining our health in very dangerous ways, not just by making us obese, but by creating new, antibiotic resistant strains of eColi and other pathogens. The small American farmer is under attack as well. While I admit I'm a vegetarian and so may be biased, I'm vowing to buy more organic whenever I can. If I wasn't a vegetarian already, this documentary would have convinced me to become one, although I do think the film gives a fair shake to organic farmers who raise livestock and isn't necessarily pro-veg. Everyone should see this film!

B004T4KQJS|1.0|Krauss' work, in all its knowledge and thoroughness, is still extremely reminiscent of a mix of sophist philosophy and a desperate need to replace God with something far, far weirder. Yes, it takes a lot of faith to claim that science shows that something will always emerge from nothing. Such strength is to be admired, as it is also based on nothing.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved \\"WOOL\\"! (And being a knitter, the title didn't bother me one bit). Great sci-fi always creates a world so well developed that you feel like you are living there. I could feel my feet hit the rungs of the spiral staircase reaching throughout the 147 levels of the Silo where survivors of the last atomic war have survived for hundreds of years; living like worker ants beneath the surface of a barren scorched earth. Here in Silo 18, the inhabitants are stored like seeds waiting for the future moment when the earth's atmosphere will be safe enough for them to go forth and repopulate the world. Wool 1 opens with a \\"cleaning\\" and we slowly grasp what happens to those residents who question those in authority. The novel's setting is mesmerizing; the characters are carefully drawn with multilayered personalities. Fans of the Hunger Games who are hungry for more great dystopian fiction will not be disappointed! Wool has already been optioned by Fox. In the meantime, I will be looking forward to reading more of Mr. Howey's fiction.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Pros:  lots of fun...quite a number of puzzles to solve. Each doesn't take much time.  No real math or language skills required. I would imagine that people who like games like sudoku would like this. Honestly I probably won't have gotten it for 4.95 before I tried it. But after trying it, I would buy.<br /><br />Not sure if you can reset completed puzzles so that someone else can play.<br /><br />Cons:  Would be nice if there was a timer so you can see how long you take or compete on time.  Also something to keep in mind- not the games fault, but my tablet is smaller so I often hit the wrong square and need to undo.  This is sometimes frustrating and probably worse for people with bigger fingers.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is finally here ive been waiting like for ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game it is A great mind game it is a 5star game. it workes on kindle fire. :)
1469984202|5.0|I just finished reading Wool Omnibus, and I have never experienced such a letdown. Not in the book. It's everything the other reviewers say it is. The letdown comes from the fact that nothing I read from now on will hold a candle to this story. Come on Ridley Scott...PLEASE get this to the big screen soon!<br />I read this book in a couple of days, and couldn't put it down. I read it while at work, while waiting at the railroad crossing, even in church! It's that good. Read this story....or you'll be sent out for the cleaning!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is one of the good ones. Many e-books are garbage but this one was very good. I will be buying book 2.
0345803485|1.0|I usually don't read these types of novels, so maybe this review will be biased.  However, I thought I would give it a try because EVERYONE I talked to was buzzing about it.<br /><br />It was thoroughly terrible.  Incredibly unbelievable, if a man talked or behaved that with me I wouldn't even give him the opportunity to make me bite my lip or turn some ridiculous shade of red (which I must say If I had to read about Ana doing either one of the mentioned things one more time I would have screamed.)<br /><br />I only made it through a third of the book, and sadly I must say this one is going in the recycling bin.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game loads of fun. I only wish your energy would recharge faster. Other than that I can spend hour on this game great app.
B007XNAPNY|4.0|I was at the show down here in Rio de Janeiro last April/12. Great performance! They are really in a good shape!. But, where is Save a Prayer?!! This classic could not be out of it :(  ;(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book (have only read first one so far) .....well written and entertaining! Can't wait to finish to get to the 2nd and 3rd books....
0345803485|4.0|Some says this book is too erotic. But personally I think this book is very interesting and good for reading over the bag break. I recommend this book for those who love romance:)
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is sooooooo addicting! so glad they finally have it for the kindle fire! :-) everyone should get the app -- its awesome!
0345803507|5.0|I ordered this second book after three days I've received my first book. This trilogy is amazing and you better order the third one when ordering this one because you do not want to wait another two to three days for the following book!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Need to request a winning hand each time or there is no opportunity to win.  It would be great if there was a setting for this.
0465068367|5.0|Excellent book concerning the crimes and atrocities committed against the Chinese in Nanking in 1937 by the Japanese army.  During the Nanking Massacre, the Japanese committed a litany of atrocities against innocent civilians, including mass execution, raping, looting, and burning. It is impossible to keep a detailed account of all of these crimes. However, from the scale and the nature of these crimes as documented by survivors and the diaries of the Japanese militarists, the chilling evidence of this historical tragedy is indisputable.  I can understand why some would like to sweep this segment of their history under the rug.  I'm sure there are those who feel the same way about the Holocaust.  If interested, some may want to check two good films on the Rape of Nanking, \\"John Rabe\\" and \\"The City of Life and Death.\\"  Some horrors should never be forgotten, even if some want to delude themselves into pretending it never happened.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Boring, 70s porn music, endless scenes of walking, BORING! I was expecting more action here, waste of a MMA fighter. Soderbergh is clearly just phoning it in here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful trilogy.  At first I resisted buying it since it was advertised as young adult, but I read an article in an AARP magazine (well, I guess that tells you I'm definitely not a young adult) and it was highly recommended.  Well-written and adults will love it as well as teenagers.  I read the first book in one day and then promptly got the next two and finished them by the end of the week.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really like this game a lot.  u get to unlock and other stuff like that soo<br />LIKE GET IT
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a great game to play. so I would get it if I was you. start playing go go go ;-)
B005L38QK2|5.0|The Diablo 3 Mouse works great for D3. It is perfect to preform all duties needed in game. It also works better than your average mouse for WoW and other games.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Somebody once leveled the following criticism of science fiction against sci-fi author Theodore Sturgeon:  \\"ninety percent of everything written in sci-fi is crud.\\"  To which Sturgeon supposedly replied, \\"But ninety percent of EVERYTHING is crud!\\"<br /><br />The remark took on a life of its own, and now even has it's own Wikipedia page as \\"Sturgeon's Law.\\"<br /><br />Anyhow, Brad Pitt's \\"Troy\\" is an good example of it.<br /><br />About 10% is fantastic and really worth seeing, especially if you're reading the Iliad and would just like to get some good visuals:<br /><br />1.  Achilles killing the Thessalian hero at the beginning.<br />2.  All the ships sailing upon Troy.<br />3.  The actual sack of Troy.<br /><br />But the other 90%?  Crud.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|I wish I had paid attention to the other reviews....  this was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen!!!  It was long and boring!!!!  I wouldn't recommend to anyone...  except maybe someone who likes to see people being killed in graphic ways....  but even that couldn't make up for how boring this movie was...
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is so well written that I couldn't put it down. Not only did it explain why we get fat, but backed up the facts with experimental evidence. Being written by a doctor who has great respect for the scientific method gave me confidence that what he was saying could be trusted. The method the doctor advised on how to lose fat and return to a healthy state was totally different from the usual diet advice, and for me, has made losing weight a much less scary process than with normal diets. Not only will this diet help you lose weight, but will reduce your blood pressure if you are hypertensive, will lower your cholesterol, will lower your chances of getting Type 2 Diabetes, and will protect you from the diseases of ageing, including arthritis, heart disease and some cancers.  On this diet, you will never go hungry. This is the best and most sensible book on diet and health that I have ever read.
B0082RX7EE|5.0|For us bored and married housewives this is a great series to get excited over. Even though it made me realize how humdrum my own sex life is , it was fun to read about the kinkier side of sex out there ! So the big question is how do I subtley let my hubby know this would be a fun book for him to read .??.. Maybe get ideas!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Makes me wish I had discovered this app much earlier. I hope there is a sequel! I've enjoyed this so much already!
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad its finally out!! this is the best game ever!!!!! I could play this game all day long!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This looks beautiful &amp; runs flawlessly on my Xoom.<br /><br />The idea is simple, but allows for a very satisfying puzzle experience.<br /><br />The lack of a timer and beautiful music &amp; graphics make it easy to just lose yourself in this very enjoyable game.<br /><br />I paid for this and it is well worth the 99&cent;. I would be happy to pay for more levels and games from this developer.<br /><br />While others pack in bloated features &amp; complicated controls and rules, it's nice to see something elegantly designed with simple &amp; intuitive visuals, game play , &amp; controls.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally thank you I love this game a I have been waiting and waiting and waiting till it came out :)
B0041KKYGU|4.0|Ilaughed out load throughout the entire movie!  It's a dark comedy and maybe you have to have a certain sense of humor to really appreciate it, as I did.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|there are some minks to it such as the time it takes to get energy but still really funny its also freenso you may as well try it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very useful.  I like the how it can figure your &quot;tip&quot;.<br />The key pad on the kindle fire is nice and big. Easy to use.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|WOW!  This book is very entertaining!  Need to escape from reality for awhile??  If so, read this one!  You will be glad you did!
B0000C4LXG|5.0|There is something about this raw and primitive album that has me coming back after all the years I've owned it.  Yes, many of the musicians would be replaced by better musicians later, but this is still one of my favorites.  Back when it came out, this album was charting new territory.  As usual, I must warn those not into Black Metal that this may not be your type of music and you may not understand it.  For those already into Black Metal, you most likely have an opinion already.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This product is amazing it is almost a Pc office package. It is very complete although i would like.some other features but is not necesary.
B000025SJ8|5.0|Somehow, Varg has written songs which are both simple, yet complex at the same time.  I consider this album as essential as Mayhem, Dark Throne and Emperor.  The music is brilliant, from a Black Metal perspective.  Somebody into Mozart or the Beatles may not see it that way, understandably.
0553386794|5.0|I love the HBO series and love this novel.  GRRM's gift of storytelling drew me in from the start. All his characters, even the secondary and tertiary characters are well developed.  The expansive world, though bleak and sinister, is excellently crafted and is brought to life by the stories of all the characters. Yes, there are MANY characters and locations, names and nicknames, family lines, sigels, plots and subplots to follow but they are expertly tied in with one another.  The characters are multidimensional, flawed, and feel refreshingly real.  I respect GRRM for being courageous for showing all the grey elements of human nature and going against cliches even if it means pushing readers' buttons.  I felt uncomfortable reading taboo scenes, but you have to realize this is no fairytale.  The story is grim but it gives the reader a sense of how living in The Dark Ages may have been like.  For sure, the novel is not for everyone especially if you like Disney type endings and portrayals.  However, if you enjoy a thought provoking fantasy book that may challenge your intellect (especially my memory of surnames and pronouns) and moral compass, you may enjoy and appreciate the depth and prose of GRRM like I do.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting FOREVER 4 this game. I'm so excited! Yay Yay Yay! I almost screamed when they got it I was soooo happy!
0439023491|1.0|I enjoyed the first book, The Hunger Games, despite the fact that Suzanne Collins denied having been inspired by a very similar novel written almost a decade ago by the title \\"Battle Royale\\".  I liked the original premise and felt that although the writing style is appropriately written for young adult fiction, the second book Catching Fire did not live up to my expectations that the first book had set my hopes up for.  Catching Fire started out with promise but midway I started to despise the main characters for their ignorance--why reenter another round of the games and miss the opportunities to start an uprising early on??  The second half of the book dragged and felt gimmicky at best.  The characters lacked depth and the games this time around felt ridiculous.  It was as if I was watching the bad sequel to a movie, like \\"The Hangover 2\\". The writing feels juvenile and disorganized.  There is much more \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing\\" in this sequel.  By the time I got to the end, I did not care for Katniss and found her obnoxious and weak.  The perfect opportunity to take the book in a different direction to build Katniss' character was simply lost midway.  I'm not sure if I care to read the last book.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|Bought this to connect my Apple TV digital/optical out to my Zone 2 Denon receiver. Since my receiver only allows analog audio, had to get something to convert the apple TV optical out. The sound is good, but the bass seems to be strong. This could be my speaker/receiver settings, but haven't figured out the fix yet. Other than the strong bass, the sound quality is pretty good. Can't beat the price.
B007J7LFTW|5.0|I was reluctant to buy this, fearing it would be a let-down. I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it follows the original without being repetitive. I discover a new nuance each time I listen to this album. If you loved the first album, you will also love this one! Ian Anderson is still very much relevant!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I was extremely pleased with this short story by Stephen King.  Loved it! A great thriller and could not put it down.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|I am very pleased with the ease of use and utility of this app. It also includes a very handy alarm!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I admit I had never heard of the books before the movie came out, and even then I knew very little of the story. While obviously written for a teen audience (there's absolutely no curing in the book or movie), I still found the book to be very entertaining. The future world that Katniss inhabits is very bleak but well-drawn. I especially like the Katniss character and though that Suzanne Collins did a great job of making a person that other teen girls can identify with when it comes to self-doubts etc., but find that extra in her she didn't know she had. Overall I would recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I have it downloaded on my iphone as well as my kindle fire. For me, it is endless fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited for so long to get this game on my Kindle Fire. I was so tired of seeing knockoffs like Temple Ruin and Temple Run. Finally this game is on the Android Market! I love it. It's fun to play especially on my Kindle Fire.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really enjoy apps that challenge me and this one fit the bill perfectly. I'd never heard of Cross Me before and I was a little skeptical at first, but after going through the tutorial, which was pretty clear, I gave it a shot. I have not been disappointed yet!
B0086700CM|5.0|after all that waiting amazon has finally came out with one of the best apps ever! hopefully they come out with more such as jetpack joyride and stuff!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|quite challenging. I enjoy that you have to get enough points for unlocking the others. it makes you set a goal in your mind to beat the clock and win.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a fun game. It works great. Has good graphics love the one touch moves and has a winning deal option
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is a little like sudoku except you are making a picture and, in my opinion, is more fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! it makes reading and UNDERSTANDING the Bible so much easier!!! the fact that you can personalize the way you want to read it makes this app great for anyone! also, the reminders help :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|wish you could get energy quicker without having to spend money but fun nonetheless reminds me of the old game but more modern
B0086700CM|5.0|My little sister has Temple run on her iPod touch and I've been waiting forever for Imangi Studios to put it on the fire. I love this game so much and it looks a lot better on the fire than it does on the iPod Touch! Good job!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love this app but gave it four stars because it cant be used without Internet :-(  love the plans and different versions of the Bible right there to compare!
B005KELQEU|5.0|We wanted to protect our Kindle from scratches while being carried in a purse or backpack.  The Belkin sleeve is the perfect fit - snug, but not too tight. It has some thin padding, but without the case becoming bulky. We had seen other sleeves with more padding in retail stores but they appeared bulky.  This one is very sleek and fits inside a purse easily.  The case appears to be well made and has a very classy design. The sleeve zips shut to keep your Kindle securely inside.  This Belkin model was one of the lowest priced Kindle sleeves we found, so we took a chance.  It has exceeded our expectations.  Highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the most fun and versatile ways for me to get involved in the Word. I highly recommend anything from YouVersion.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This game is addictive l!!! its great fun the games is not too hard but its by no way easy.  great fun for anyone who hidden object games
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally temple run is out for kindle fire!! This is great!!<br />p.s. all the reviews submitted for this app are on may 27, 2012.<br />P.S.S. almost all of them start with finally!!!<br /><br />Hooray for Imangi Studios!!!!!! Ive been waiting forever for this app!!! Thanks for not letting us kindle fire owners down!!!!!
B005L38QK2|3.0|The mouse itself is great and I can't really complain about it much. The two buttons on the right side could afford to be in a better position. I often click one of them on accident which is bad because it is the hardest button to get to purposefully (I'm aware of how dumb that sounds) and thus houses the diablo 3 skill with the longest cooldown.<br />Aside from that, the mouse is responsive, ergonomic, easy to get used to, and aesthetically pleasing to a gamer. My girlfriend did make fun of me a bit, but I digress.<br /><br />I really came here to review the software. It is nothing short of awful. It is packed full of features for customizing the mouse, all the way down to the LED's (which look awesome lighting up the Diablo 3 logo), all of the buttons can be customized, you can set different profiles for different programs etc... The options are fairly easy to set up.<br /><br />However, in windows 7, the software must be run as an administrator in order for any of the non-standard buttons to do anything at all. Setting the program to always run as administrator does not fix this issue. Furthermore, whenever the computer is turned off or goes into sleep mode, the software stops working. What this means is that if you want to use the gaming buttons for any reason, you have to close the software, open the software as an administrator, select the profile for the application you are in, and go about your business. This must be done every time your computer is restarted or taken out of sleep mode. Even this would not be a big deal except the program must be closed and reopened every single time, and it does neither with haste.<br /><br />Switching between the profiles is also a problem. The software can be set to switch automatically when an .exe is run but it often doesn't seem to work and obviously won't work if the programs are already running. Also, I have yet to find a way to set a steam game to auto-switch. The only other way to switch is to open the software andmanually switch over. Quitting diablo 3 and switching to google chrome means that the forward and back buttons will not work until the profile is switched. Again this would not be problematic if the program did not take forever to open, even from a minimized state, but it does. Often maximizing even causes the program to freeze and then you must start the whole fiasco described above over again.<br /><br />Perhaps with software updates this will be a four or five star mouse, but if you plan on buying this now consider the headache that using the software will be against the nerdgasm that is the mouse itself.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Nothing different to add from the others - excellent performance, overclocks really well and really good value given that the 3770K is about a $100 more for an increase in performance not justified by the +$100 price offset. You can probably use the stock cooler if your chassis/system has plenty of cooling. My setup has the ASUS P8Z77-V deluxe board with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus with this CPU.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Expected a fun book to read, but was very disappointed.  Boring, repetitious and poorly written. The \\"story\\" in the first book could have been compressed into 10 pages.  Will not be purchasing next two books in trilogy.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The title pretty much says it all - awesome cooling for the price. My CPU temp never goes higher than 35C when running at 4.3GHz. The instructions could be better. There is a video on youtube showing someone installing the cooler (a few obvious change in his process needed) but you get an idea of the process from the video. The cooler is pretty big and so, make sure your case has ample space for it.
B007RFJ4QM|5.0|I was hesitant about this one - but after watching it, I have to say \\"Marky Mark\\" has come into his own as an actor. This is definitely a terrific movie, filled with action, adventure, family drama and acceptance as well as non-family betrayal. My recommendation? DEFINITELY buy this one! Pop a gigantic bowl of popcorn with melted butter ALL over it and enjoy it with the kids! Yep, with the kids. Phooey reference the fat content in the popcorn butter - 'cause this movie is also butter baby!
B0086700CM|5.0|oh my gosh ive been waiting for this game to finally be put on here for kindle fire this game so much fun
0375846735|5.0|We've made it through the adventures of Lyra Belacqua and her encounters through the world of \\"His Dark Materials\\". We first met her and her daemon in \\"The Golden Compass\\" where in Oxford, England, she lived a carefree life, until her friend Roger was kidnapped by Gobblers and set to the North where she uncovered more than just following a rescue mission. Then in \\"The Subtle Knife\\", she met a new friend named Will Parry and together they went to find answers to their questions, but they found more danger than answers. Now in the third book \\"The Amber Spyglass\\", Lyra, Will, and all of the characters we've met will all see the danger in the world of Dust.<br />  In the start of it all, Lyra and her daemon Pan are in a deep sleep set by her mother, Mrs. Coulter, who are all in a cave in a Himalayan mountain. Meanwhile, Will Parry is by himself in the forest and all of a sudden, he hears the voices of two angels, who are able to help Will survive while he in trying to finding Lyra. As for Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, he is at a tower with the two angels Will met who tell him the whereabouts of Lyra and Will. Later, Will meets Ama and reunites with Iorek Byrnison, who altogether find the cave where Lyra is, and after they rescue Lyra and getting into a rough scuffle with Mrs. Coulter, they're going to find out what going on. While doing so, they encounter angels, a war approaching and the bond between each other.<br />  It's been one long ride for me, and it just left me in a quiet and satisfied mood. It manages to go along pretty well and I do think that maybe the book had too much to show. Aside from that, it will still put you on a roller coaster ride that will get you lost at times but still make you surprised. I didn't quite find it as original as book one, but more better than book two. Some readers will say that's too long and a little tiring, but it will still leave them in a daziness mood. I thought the ending was both wonderful and bittersweet, but it still leaves enough for a possible fourth book. Let hope this isn't really goodbye to Lyra Belacqua.es enough for a possible fourth book. Let hope this isn't really goodbye to Lyra Belacqua.
B0086700CM|5.0|thank its finally here<br /> this is the legit temple run although I expected its rank to be higher on the app store scale.  I thought it'd be top 10 atleast
B001IYVUEW|1.0|I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was really boring and disappointing. I generally like Katie Holmes and think she was fine in the movie, but Christian Bale was lousy and so was the plot and direction of this movie. If you just want to see a series of technical movie stunts followed by a few mildly romantic scenes surrounding a plethora of neurotic, self-absorbed dialogue, psychosis, and horrible directing, then you might be interested in watching this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg. I have been looking for this game every and final I found it on amazon appstore I'm so happy I have played this game a million times on my friends and I really love it I give it a rate of a million

B001G70M6S|5.0|BACKGROUND: I've been using this for exposure testing with Hasselblad and Mamiya (medium format) cameras. Yes, some people still use these things without digital backs, especially for educational purposes. For those who aren't familiar with pre-digital medium format photography, these cameras have backs that contain the film which can be removed from the camera without exposing the film. Unlike a 35mm, you can put some instant film into a \\"polaroid back\\", load a roll of 120 negative film into a 120 film back, put the polaroid back on the camera to get some instant feedback as to whether your setup is working, take two shots, then switch the back to the 120 for taking the real photos. This was particularly important when you had multiple thousands of dollars invested in a studio setup for a several hour shoot and you needed some assurance that your camera and settings were working properly. You could then switch the backs again when something changed without wasting all of your unused film. This also allowed people to change the ISO on cameras without wasting film before digital sensors. At this point you hopefully have new appreciation for how the average consumer with a $100 camera can now switch ISO settings at will and view their photos immediately.<br /><br />ACTUAL REVIEW: The FP-3000B works well for what I'm using it for. Using a Sekonic exposure chart, I took a +/- 1 stop 3 shot bracket of the chart with this film to help me calibrate my light meter for the film/camera and test the exposure latitude of the film. The chart basically has gray patches with 50% reflectance in the middle with patches going down and up +/- 2 stops in reflectance in 1/6th stop increments. When properly exposed, the FP-3000B shows detail in the whole 4 stop range of the chart. Given that the lightest patch shows up as barely darker than the white of the paper, and the darkest patch is very slightly lighter than total black, it's clear that the film has a 4 stop (4EV) exposure latitude which is pretty good.<br /><br />So, if you're using a light meter, just make sure that the darkest significant areas are no more than -2EV from correct exposure and the lightest areas are no more than 2EV from correct and you should get detail everywhere. (If you don't have a dedicated light meter, take a (D)SLR and use the spot meter in that to meter a scene to give you a general idea of what parts of the scene are light or dark enough to render detail.<br /><br />So, good stuff for fancy expensive medium-formay pro cameras, and no doubt just as good for \\"vintage\\" consumer cameras as well. Just don't get the nasty chemicals from the peel-off on your skin or clothing. That stuff is caustic and bleaches fabric.<br /><br />Glad that Fuji is still making this stuff, even if they've killed off pretty much all other versions of the instant B&W film.e which is pretty good.<br /><br />So, if you're using a light meter, just make sure that the darkest significant areas are no more than -2EV from correct exposure and the lightest areas are no more than 2EV from correct and you should get detail everywhere.

B0086700CM|5.0|thanks amazon. but a little late, ya think?? instead of getting those other stupid apps, get apps like these, amazon. the fun ones. I mean seriously. but thanks. next please get toca hair salon. that's fun.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Terific plot and cg or graphics,story line was very earthly and well documented only being an ex serviceman the characters couldve gotten a a better military haircut which I found distracting especially during the ww2 days where long hair was not fashionable but overall, again a superb movie!
B0086700CM|5.0|I used to always play this on my friends iphone, so ive been waiting to get it since then. get this app!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|really fun and sometimes challenging. zombies are sometimes. pretty funny.a lot of power ups and allies that can be useful.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely live this game. you'd think it might be boring, but it is solo fun! its addicting. Basically it is just running jumping and ducking.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I just got done reading fifty shades and loved it soo much! I was looking for books that's closest to the romance of fifty and seen a lot of review about beautiful disaster and thought I should check it out. Once I downloaded this book, I couldnt put this book down, I finished it in a day n half. Highly recommend!!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This territory has been explored previously by Nicci French in 'Killing me Softly: a lover who likes a bit of slap and tickle but verges into the abusive on occasion. Although NF handled it far better and the lover becomes outright menacing and dangerous as the plot develops. This never really progresses beyond soap-opera erotica - Mills and Boon for the modern, erotic age, if you will.<br /><br />The overblown descriptions are typical Mills and Boon territory and I almost imagined a Jilly Cooper type character in some scenes: 'Oh, super-doopa, I'm getting shagged again!'. If now I'm verging into comic opera, then maybe that's a measure of just how serious this book can be taken. As a bit of lightweight fluff, fine. But don't expect more from it than that.
B0086700CM|5.0|THANK YOU SO MUCH FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG THANK U THANK U any way this game is awesome and now its on kindle fire
B007MJSQSK|2.0|I think the lack of realism ruined the movie for me.  I'm not talking about the graphics they look great except for the fact that everyone besides the main character has an overly large nose which I really didn't like, I'm talking about the story in general.  Its starts out very interesting but loses my attention when the main character is able to overcome so many adversities so easily.  It just seemed like lazy writing to me.  If the main character had not so easily overcome his obstacles I probably would have enjoyed the movie.  Also the second lead character is rather annoying.  I don't think this movie is excellent.  I think its okay but I don't recommend it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|How do you understand a mother abandoning her child?  You can't but in reading this story I almost could.  The Language of Flowers is a story that has touched me in the deepest simplest human level.  Mother love, romantic love, redemption, forgiveness, acceptance, all universal themes I have read about before, but here they are treated in such a delicate and heartbreaking story.  I recommend this book highly.  Its engaging and lovely, what more can you ask for in a book.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is a very well directed film about two regular surfer-types who fall for each other, even though one of them is fighting in himself as he tries to accept that he has emotional feelings for another male. Easy to follow and believe plot. Good to watch a film in which the gay characters are not cast as the perceived stereotype.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|This is a wonderful film with a great cast giving pitch-perfect performances. Cate Blanchett won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama, and should have won an academy award (Gwyneth Paltrow, the winner for her work in Shakespeare in Love, was good, but it was hardly a performance or a film near the caliber of Cate and Elizabeth).  Elizabeth is a period piece you can sink into.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun game. don't care so much for in game spending but you don't really need to. great graphics. like it.
0307719219|3.0|I'm fascinated by the concepts in this book and was really excited to read it.  Unfortunately, the authors seem to repeat the same ideas and buzzwords in every paragraph.  The ideas are profound, and I enjoy the history lessons along the way.  It's just really hard to make progress reading this because they keep saying the same things over and over and over again.  It's hard to tell which point they're trying to make with each chapter because the arguments are so repetitive.  (If you feel that way after reading this review, then you get my point!)
B000WQWPKA|3.0|When I first found it, this was a wonderful video, and took me back to watching it on the big screen when it was first released. Later, I ran across the Limited Edition of Independence Day and I must say the restored nine minutes of original footage made the film much more enjoyable. Unfortunately, this original version lacks those removed segments and just isn't as enjoyable without them. Perhaps it's a commentary that I'd rather watch the DVD version of the Limited Edition than this BluRay version of the film without the restored scenes. I continue to wait and hope that someone decides to release a BluRay version of the full production.
0345803493|5.0|I read all three books in the trilogy, and thought they were good, well written and thought provoking.  They are especially written for women, sit back and enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally on kindle fire. its awesome I love it i scored 140,897 on here I love it its just so amazing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game can be boring sometimes but other than that it is fun and I play it alot. very fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like It, it had Lot's of cool games that you could play.!<br />why.? only because I loved download it now.!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is so addicting I cant put it down to go to the bathroom.I highly recommend this game for all ages.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I bought this because it was colorful and the reviews were good. I was pleased when I put it together. It matched with our decor and the music is pleasant. There is a low setting for sound so it won't be too loud. My husband even enjoys going to sleep with its tunes. When my son was a newborn it didnt too much for him. But when he was about 2 months he enjoyed looking at the animals. He squeals and is so excited and it can keep him entertained for a good half hour. Now most of the time the mobile can put him to sleep at 4 months. BUT this week the motor died! The music still plays but the animals won't turn. He's really disappointed. I'm gonna call Fisher Price and make them fix it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Even though it has adds (they go away though) it is awesome. It plays nicely on my kindle fire. It never freezes like other apps. Really entertaining!
0345803507|5.0|i loved the third book so much... i could not put it down.. lots of emotions<br /><br />you must read the first 2 before!<br /><br />great series!
B007REAIUE|4.0|I tried the free single, while this style music doesnt \\"do it\\" for me,,,(at my old age) Im thinking the Editors have Discovered the Next \\"Elvis\\", keep on rockin, I am,,From my rockin chair !
0345803493|5.0|if you havent read the first one... you ought to... as you wont get the full emotions in the second one.<br /><br />In this book, we learn the reasons why Grey is how he is and how he deals with Anastasia and the dynamic of her personality.<br /><br />awesomeness... i loved it.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Possibly the worst Mission Impossible ever. The movie streamed great with no buffering. Pick another movie because there is plenty to choose from
0345803485|3.0|I really enjoyed this book...<br /><br />there were spots in it that got so intense (against my own thinking and judgement)that i had to put down the book.... i must say though of the three...this was most difficult to get through (again, probably the stalker control domination elements) but i urge you to continue and finish it and head into the 2nd and 3rd book where things become more interesting.<br /><br />Also the author uses some words very often so to some it may seem juvenile and annoying..nevertheless i liked the book and the series.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|\\"Men In Black 3\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Agents J and K are back... in time. J has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never told him -- secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young Agent K to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind.<br /><br />The cast led by Will Smith (as Agent J), Tommy Lee Jones (as Agent K) & Josh Brolin (as Young Agent K) is great. The directing by Barry Sonnenfeld is great. The story & screenplay (based on Lowell Cunningham's comic book) by Etan Cohen is great.<br /><br />The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Bill Pope is great. The film editing by Don Zimmerman & Wayne Wahrman is great. The casting by Ellen Chenoweth is great. The production design by Bo Welch is great. The art direction by Kasra Farahani, Luke Freeborn, W. Steven Graham, Kevin Ishioka, Maya Shimoguchi & Chris Shriver is great. The set decoration by Susan Bode is great. The costume design by Mary E. Vogt is great. The make-up effects designed by Rick Baker is great. The visual effects supervised by Ken Ralston & Jay Redd and coordinated by Danielle Birch, Ann-Marie Blommaert, Rachel Faith Hanson, Nancy Heller, Chelsea Kammeyer, Eric Kimelton, Bryan Searing, Clint Spillers, Barry St. John, Claire Sun, Svetlana Tesnes & Yi Yang are great. The special effects supervised by Mark Hawker & coordinated by Jeff Brink are great. The stunts coordinated by Simon Crane, Doug Coleman, Wade Eastwood & Brian Machleit is great.<br /><br />This is a great sequel that was well worth the 10 years' wait on. This is much better than the last sequel and a little bit better than the original \\"Men In Black\\". This is a well-made and well-crafted sequel that is also a terrific summer movie, making it one of the best movies of the summer, so far. Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones are back and are great as ever, with additional support from Josh Brolin, who is great as the younger Agent K.
B0086700CM|5.0|my dad has an I pad and I told him to get temple run for me now I can play it whenever I want!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally after all the other stupid ganes they put on this thing finally TEMPLE RUN it is so adddicting! Finally!
B006RED4GA|5.0|I liked it!  This movie was fun and scary.  Plus it had a little quirky humor thrown it.  Great entertainment!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This does what it says it does. very handy to have. you will find millions of uses everyday. i enjoy using this app.  download it now.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game on the kindle for sure. I love it and personally it is my favorite game on kindle. DEFINITELY A MUST BUY!!!!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I did enjoy this one about the same of the Mark Wahlberg Apes movie.  Story was still captivating-even touching at times.  It did tie in well as the prequel as I had hoped.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|I'm still surprised they didn't push to release this in theaters around June, but I guess they wanted to do the film release during the Summer. The film itself was extremely funny and just a ton of Summer fun. The bits about the reunion were actually unneeded and many of the original cast members seemed to only be in the fiml as to say, \\"hey remember me? I was in the original!\\" However the main 5 guys had the same comrodery and fun that they did 11 years ago when American Pie 2 came out, and it seems like they never missed a beat. The movie was hilariously funny and nostalgically sweet, and is easily the best comedy to come out since the original Hangover. I look forwar to adding the Blu-Ray to my collection and watching it for years to come. I am also excited the film has fared so well at the box office and will most likely warrant another return to East Great Falls to hang out with the boys again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game so much. iplay it every night vbefore I fall asleep. try it its fun. thank you.<br />for trying this fun game.
B007N0REX6|3.0|This isnt great , its got a few rockin moments , no more heroes its a lie a pretty good , but just like alter bridge Kennedy makes every song so similer  , his voice is unique but a tad boring , same ole. Good ablum , but no where near great
B0086700CM|5.0|I actually sent amazon an email about offering temple run on the kindle fire and other ios games that apple has maybe that contributed to them making temple run on the fire overall it is a really addicting game
B0086700CM|5.0|yes its spelled correctly and its finally here in the Amazon market. Is it worth all the hype and all the crying and bad reviews to all the impostors? The answer is YES. This game is Super fun and very addictive.  It looks that much more amazing on the Kindle Fire! Love it! Get It!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|everyone will love the chalange and free games.<br />The way you must progrees is a good idea and the new games are great too
B0072IVGZG|3.0|I love this band. That being said I won't sugarcoat my review. This cd is ok but that's it. It's almost like they tried too hard to get away from their signature sound and it didn't really work all that well. Plus to make this cd sound optimal it needs to be played really loud. Ian dropping the F-bomb like never before makes me worry that he's too focused on trying to be hip and attempting to relate to a market segment of people whose every other word is F than staying true to what The Cult really is. The Cult is a legendary band that doesn't need to worry about hipness and perception. Every song has potential on the cd but it's like after they recorded the songs they went back and said ok what can we do to make this not sound like The Cult? The 4 song ep that came with this release is a better sounding cd than the main cd. But as long as they keep recording I'll keep on buying.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I mean this thing is already a really good deal for a 4 core easily overclock able processor. Then it dropped like 25 bucks so I thought what the hell I need a new one. I am so glad I got it can't wait to see what it will max out at.
B0086700CM|5.0|I haave waited for this for so long. I have been adictted to temple run and pretty Mich not let go of my mom iphone all weekend. NOW I CAN LET IT GO!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a wonderful game! I just started and I'm addicted! already on level 5! cant wait for more to see in this app!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Ok a lot alike Frontier land on facebook, so those of you who like that and play you will enjoy this one too, you are able to invite friends and go to their place and do work just like the other games.  Easy enough for all ages.
0345803485|5.0|I was hearing more and more people talking about this book, with mixed reviews of course. So I decided to take a chance and start reading it.<br />I read all three books in a little under a week! It is SUPER easy to read. I do agree that many phrases were repetitive, but it is still addicting to read in my opinion. I finished the last book last night and was sad (surprisingly). After reading the last chapter of the final book written from Christians point of view, I am actually thinking about reading the first book over again :)<br />I enjoyed the books and I am curious what the films outcome will be like (since the movie rights have just been bought)
B0086700CM|5.0|hey I just got this game on my kindle. I been waiting over a year to get this game. the people who don't like well then your stupid!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|yes ' its free and thhe best game ever! ! totally worth  it especially sknce its free' just try it! !!
B007944TE8|5.0|A most amazing series. Far from the typical drama with gunshots and sex scenes, Gabriel Byrne takes the viewer deep into the therapist's office, where all of our inner fears and doubts and loves are revealed. We are not all so different after all.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so freaking exited that TEMPLE RUN IS FINALLY HERE!!!! I legit just did a happy dance running around my house yelling ITS FINALLY HERE ....... TEMPLE RUN IS FINALLY HERE!!!!! temple run is the most greatest,awesomenessly,obertastic,amazing,most loved game EVER!!!!!
B006OT03BM|5.0|I bought this a while ago but never had time to write a review. I've had this for a few months and I absolutely love it. Although the box itself is just sturdy cardboard with a steel effect to it, the overall quality of the set is very nice. I got a legible signature and everything was packed neatly. If you are a collector of box sets or a die hard Bayformers fan then you definitely need to get this! I only with they they gave you a digital copy of Dark of the Moon but the price for this was well payed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Quick and User friendly. Good calculator for all ages. I think it especially good for persons who are visually impaired. It is also good for kids who are just learning to use a calculator.
B006LQQ1GE|2.0|I read all the hype about this kid and just happened to come across a copy of the disc at a flea market (a promo copy/bar code punched), so for $2.00 I thought it a good deal. Sadly, I paid $1.50 too much.  Who turns on the high velocity publicity machine for such mediocrity?...the guy nicely channels fellow Aussie Colin Hay, snags some Sting, swipes some Pink Floyd cerebral white noise (as mentioned in other comments), and even clones his far superior (and deserving of more acclaim) Joshua Radin. Just a boring and tedious listening experience.  Luckily, the CD Exchange gave me .75 for it, so all was not lost. His Lana Del Ray-like fame should fade in 5...4...3..............
1416972250|5.0|I've really enjoyed all three novels that I've read so far in Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series, but I'm most partial to this one.  By book three the reader is familiar with all of the leading characters but they become fully developed in this novel. I feel like they've grown and matured and I've tagged along watching that growth. Some of the bigger plot twists I fully expected, but there were several that came as a complete surprise. I like when that happens!<br /><br />By the time I reached the last two-thirds of the book, as multiple plot threads overlapped and headed toward the climax, I couldn't read fast enough to see what happened next. Edge of the seat, paging turning stuff. The author ramped up the excitement with a roller coaster ride of action and emotion.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next one, especially as I become more attached to the characters. I didn't care much for Jace in the first novel but am now totally smitten. I also thought Ms. Clare did an exceptional job of portraying the varied layers of his complex relationship with Valentine.<br /><br />Other characters that  stood out for me in this book were Isabelle, Magnus Bane (love that man!) and, of course, Clary. She's been in the forefront throughout the series, along with Jace, but the hardships she faced in this one were more difficult than the other two books combined and the author had her face each in a believable manner that brought everything to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />City of Glass is my favorite of the series so far. I highly recommend! This is a book I can see myself rereading several times.
B007CVZE0Q|5.0|This collection by Keane shows these young men on a creative roll. The melodies and lyrics become a unified whole whereas with some artists one aspect outshines the other. Each song merits attention....attentive listening as they are little portraits of life and emotion and  should not be relegated to \\"background\\" comfort noise. The deluxe packaging includes a hardbound book with lyrics and a content relative short story by British novelist William Boyd.  A DVD of five acoustic versions is very nice....I plan to copy the performances for mobile listening....too bad the audio only wasn't appended to the CD.  A notation on Amazon indicates that the merchant is no longer selling this package because of some issue with the item. I found no problem save for that a numbered special print of the album artwork was to have been part of the edition, but no such item was included in the factory shrink wrapped volume. Very satisfied with this purchase.
1439170916|4.0|This reviewer decided to read \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" when his wife was diagnosed with abdominal cancer. EAM has certainly been engrossing, educational and enlightening.  That is not to say that the experience was encouraging.  It was not.<br /><br />EAM is a basic and thorough historical survey of cancer. Author Mukherjee has performed prodigious research.  There are some 68 pages of endnotes, including a nice glossary that is almost hidden among those back pages.  Further to the rear of the text secluded behind the index, is a thorough set of questions and answers.  Also, the layout and well-spaced paragraphs make for easy reading with little strain on the eye. The good news ends there.<br /><br />That is because EAM is negative and pessimistic.  The subjest matter is a serious and deadly disease! Consider the following direct quotes:<br /><br />>\\"I do not despair of carcinoma being cured somewhere in the future but this blessed achievement will never be wrought by the skill of the surgeon\\".<br /><br />>\\"Few doctors in this country seem to be involved with the non life- threatening side effects of cancer therapy.  Baldness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, broken marriages, disturbed children, loss of libido, loss of self-esteem, and body images are nurses' turf\\".<br /><br />>More drugs produce more toxicity without producing cures, as the radical chemotherapists discovered to their despair in the 1980s\\".<br /><br />> (Regarding a cancer patient): \\"It was like watching someone locked in a chess game\\"....\\"The illness acted, she reacted.  It was like a morbid, hypnotic game- a game that had taken over her life. She dodged one blow, only to be caught by another\\".  This reviewer is distantly, foggily reminded of the chess game twixt the Knight and Death in Ingmar Bergman's \\"The Seventh Seal\\".  Those who saw the film know how that one turned out!<br /><br />Given the amount of scholarship devoted to EAM, a 4 star review is virtually required. So much effort was expended herein. Yet EAM is ultimately sad and disturbing.  For all the heroics, struggle, salesmanship, politics, endless research and perpetual fund raising, how close to a \\"cure\\" for cancer are we?  The answer seems to be-very far indeed. The 470 pages of sometimes searing text were too much for this reader. Pick this one up with your eyes wide open.<br /><br />.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is my favorite game in the whole world i could never find it on the kindle fire bt i fox nd it today
B000002KHB|5.0|This album rocks long after the embers of that fateful day on December 4,1971, when as the song goes \\" We all came out to Montreux on the Lake Geneva shoreline / To make records with a mobile - We didn't have much time / Frank Zappa & the Mothers were at the best place around / But some stupid with a flare gun burned the place to the ground / Smoke on the water, fire in the sky...\\" completely extinguished and immortalized \\"Smoke on the Water\\" as Rock legend.<br />  This is arguably Deep Purple's finest studio album it is often regarded as influential and credited in the beginning development of the heavy metal music genre & this album is truly a masterpiece and should belong to any respectable music collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS GAME AND IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!! Good quality too! :-) thanks so much!!!!!
B007NESBK2|5.0|Let me say that I have been a Sade fan since the beginning so this review is not about her music per se. I also have her previous Sade Lovers Live DVD.<br />What separates this from most of the recent concert DVD's is the Blu-Ray but mostly the choreography and production values. Remember that Blu-Ray offers better sound and picture and this is where the lighting, photography and staging makes it stand out compared to many of the others out today. Sade fans will rejoice  and those of us who weren't as fortunate to attend the show this time will have a wonderful souvenir of what is a great concert experience. By the way, the recent concert Blu-Ray that is comparable in production values and the type of show is George Michael's recent Blu-Ray from London. You might check it out if you are a fan.<br />With a good sound system you may find that owning a BluRay might be almost as good as being there.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad it's finally on the Amazon App Store. I love it. You will love it to if you get it. :-)(-:
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I loved it until<br />I saw that they charged me when the game was free. also I had problems on my kindle fire. I only had problems on my kindle fire when I play this game. so warning to all who wants it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have played this game on my aunts I phone. and when. I saw it on the appstore I got so exited
B0033AI4PM|5.0|One of my all-time favorites.I would love to see this,as well as Funny Lady on blu-ray.I can't wait! Hopefully it will be soon!
B006MPK9SU|5.0|Michael Connelly is a great writer - great style and well written.  This, like all his books, has a gripping and every changing plot.  Great read.

B0086700CM|5.0|The best app ever!!! whoever says it is slow and it sucks must have a crappy phone or kindle!! lol this app is the real temple run and it is so cool!(: i highly recommend!
B00003CWOL|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for a while. I saw it shortly after it came out and laughed throughout the whole thing. I am not normally a Ben Afflack fan, and I think this may be one of his best roles. And of course you have the immortal George Carlin, as a priest, which is ironically hilarious.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love it however it is pricy at $4.99. it was free for my iphone.  I can play this game for hours.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this ever since the first time I played the game you need to get the game if thou don't already have it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game I love it I love that there are many options and its free you cant beat free I reccommend this game to everyone
B0086700CM|4.0|The game in general is addicting. But it keeps skipping on me. Either than that, it was pretty much the best game they've put on the kindle
B003HC8I5M|1.0|One of the worst albums I've heard in years. Phil's voice is uneven, awful. His arrangements of these classics just butchers them.  If it wasn't nauseating, it would be laughable.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is so adicting TREMPLE RUN it is A really fun game every one loves it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game. Takes lots of patience to try solving each level without resorting to the &quot;hints&quot;.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love this app its really fun. U can do a lot the only thing that I don't like is that u have to have WiFi to use it and that sucks because when I go somewhere like my grandparents or a friends house I cant use it because it dosent their house dosent have WiFi
B007H9B8FS|5.0|With a title like Not Your Kind Of People and a name like Garbage, Garbage seems to be daring the fine folks who still buy music (if in fact there are any left) not to purchase, let alone listen to this record, but that's not unusual as the 3 geeks from Madison, Wisconsin and their front and centre Scottish Banshee bombshell bad-ass have offered that smirked sentiment before with their \\"best of\\" collection, Absolute Garage and 2005's Bleed Like Me, which sounded like a not so appetizing dare to share in the glories of \\"that special time of the month\\".  Turns out Garbage are-in-fact that \\"kind of people\\" and this is that kind of record that will bore a hole into your consciousness like the brain scrambling worm they crammed into Chekov's ear in Wrath of Kahn!<br /><br />The entire collection of tracks play out like grainy black and white Nevada Atomic Test Site footage from the 40's.  We see a blinding flash in the distance, an ominous mushroom cloud rises like a ghostly apparition above the desert, a vacuum of uneasy silence follows, you hold your breath and then without warning you're blasted with a wall of sound that decimates every object fortunate enough to be in the way.  Yes Virginia, I said fortunate.  This is a shock and awe parlor trick sound-Maestro and drummer Butch Vig has brilliantly mastered during his knob twiddling turns for Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, Foo Fighters and Garbage; distract an unwitting victim by holding a cute fuzzy bunny out in your left hand and then unceremoniously smack the poor unsuspecting slob up against the head with the brick in your right hand.  Repeat when necessary.  Got your attention?<br /><br />Never before has Garbage done so well to recapture the seismic glory of their self-titled debut or sophomore rampage 2.0, which included the aural orgasm educing Stupid Girl, Only Happy When it Rains, I Think I'm Paranoid, Special and When I Grow Up.  Now we can all wax-poetic about the old days but why spend a lot of wasted yearning for records that already hold an exalted place in our hearts and collections?  This is a glorious new offering from Garbage and we should all find deep comfort in the fact that Shirley, Butch, Duke and Steve are back, they're still full of piss and vinegar and fully loaded with bricks!<br /><br />Now I could rattle off an Automatic-Systematic (pun intended) hit-by-hit excursion through each track but this series should be swallowed whole until you choke on each glorious morsel and gag for joy.  Thankfully not a single moment stands out above the rest as the band implements their scorched-earth policy of musical truths.  And that's what makes Not Your Kind Of People soar, every peak and valley offers new lyrical, sonic and mind bending thrills that are as exciting as ever.  Like the very best roller coasters Garbage's latest bag-o-tricks has you screaming in terror on this cork-screw, puking your guts up on that turn and squealing with giddy delight as you ease your way over the top and into another 100 mile-an-hour free fall.  And that's just in the first 11 songs!  I would offer (rather insistently in-fact) that if you're a tight-wad straddling the fence about spending a couple more quid on the Deluxe version you are well advised to do so with great haste as the additional 4 tracks don't simply pad the collection they complete it and offer some very satisfying angst indeed!  Not to mention the fact that What Girls Are Made Of resembles the darkling love-child of Siouxsie Sioux and She Wants Revenge, which in itself is well worth a trip to the nursery for an unsettling peek at what stirs behind the glass.X
B006470HZ6|1.0|Shows like this are what keep me from getting cable. TV shows are thrown together just like everything else nowadays. They slap them together, put on a snazzy title, and hope they get just enough ratings to warrant the next mediocre show.<br /><br />The first season was 'OK' enough for me to kind of want to watch the second season. I'm 5 episodes in and I'm done.<br />Every episode has parts in it that make laugh at the poor production quality. It's boring, doesn't make sense, and I just don't care about any of the characters.<br />This is the McDonald's extra value menu double-cheeseburger of TV shows. Enjoy.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love his writing, you don't want to put the book down, and he's one of the few authors that make you laugh. He is always putting in inappropriate comments that make you laugh.  Great book, I have read two of his so far and am on the third. Will definitly read more of his.

B0086700CM|1.0|Game is laggy and glitchy. Half the time I die is because of lack of responsiveness which is B.S.<br />I can't help but feel that the majority of the people 5 staring this game are rating it based on their experiences playing on their iOS devices. I have never played Temple Run before and I can hardly believe the ratings I'm seeing. My swipes register only about 80% of the time and I'm plagued by frequent lag. After playing on my Droid, I downloaded for iOS. This game runs fantastic on my iPod touch, but like junk on my Android. All of the above issues interfere with my fundamental ability to play this game; It's a step above unplayable. Using a Samsung Droid charge. 1 star.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and ive been waiting for it to come on amazon.it rocks like turd.happy birthday to saceguwea

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read Fifty shades while on an RV trip cross country with a lot of time to spend reading. My only regret is that these are the only books I took with me. I started out book one with some interest as I was interested in the building of the characters. I found myself very frustrated with Ana as she was so weak and susceptible to Mr Grey's charismatic charms. She started to grow in her self confidence and character strength in book 2, and became quite self sufficient by book 3. However, the sexual activities were so redundant that it got boring, as stated by other writers, and the lip biting and flushing/blushing were all so overdone that my interest waned more than once.  I would like to meet the \\"perfect, if flawed, man\\" whose faults could be overlooked due to his charm and convincing ways. I would also like to have the physical aptitude and endurance for the sexual exploits that were continuously happening, in land, sea and air. However, I am not acquainted with anyone who has the fortitude described in this book. With all the hype and raving reviews, I was expecting much more. I was disappointed, but have to admit that I learned much about an alternate lifestyle from this book.

B0017I1FNK|2.0|First husband's revenge on Harris ( Ahearn produced this mess.) Songs are weak  melodically and, especially, repetitious internally.  Content, when you can hear it, is about bad marriages, death, and what sounds like self-suicidal tendencies--not fit subject matter for decent people's performance or hearing.  I can appreciate resilience/resistance from the dark side but this one is so far from cathartic as to be destructive of any good to come out of listening. There is only the thought that the makers need professional help.
B0086700CM|4.0|cant wait to play this game i have been waiting forever for it it is going to very fun to play
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG FINALLY ITS ON KINDLE FIRE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS SO FUN AND ADDICTING!!!!!! YAY!!!!! OMG FINALLY!!!!
0670023329|5.0|To find out that such places such as this exist and then to read a book about it held me spellbound. I had read about political camps, but never one such as this where a young boy grows up with no emotional feelings and has never felt love of any kind is unbelievable. All the miles he traveled after escaping is absolutely<br />amazing. The inhumane treatment that many North Koreans endure certainly boggles my mind that a country such as this can last.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is a must have on the Kindle Fire! Love it! No problems ever. Works perfectly.  Downloaded one with 250 Games of Solitaire but I always come back to this one. Super easy to use.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Logic of the game reduces frustration--opportunity to repeat is facilitated by helpful hints.  Recommend as relaxing way to pass time and exercise the mind.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Often a trilogy will begin with an excellent read in the first book then become stagnant by the end of the third book. This trilogy is definitely NOT like that. The story continues to captivate and tickle the imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed the second part and highly recommend it to those who like exciting glimpses into our possible future.
0062119044|3.0|I got 70% through this book before I couldn't do it any longer. The characters are unrealistic to the point that it's impossible to sympathize with them.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What a great time I have had with Katness.  I wish there were more to read.  This, the final book of The Hunger Games, keeps the reader riveted to the fate of the characters and their way of life.  Excellent!
B000SW2F6M|5.0|wow.  I just read the most recent review and realized I viewed the theatrical version (which i still found stunning).  Now I have to go on and purchase the director's cut and re-view this film!  Ridley Scott selects a few real personages from the history of the times and then virtually completely reinvents the actual historical account.  Balian and Sarisan are real figures from real history, for those who are interested.  If you want to know what is documented and what \\"really\\" happened as far as recorded history goes, you might check out the synopsis on Balien of Ibelin at Wikepedia.  Not quite as glamorous, or as humanized, but still pretty epic.  Anyway, I would say the deployment of this story, Kingdom of Heaven, is easily as good as Gladiator, although the main character (Balian) may not be one that males of the population will as readily enjoy identification. The pacing is good, i agree the theatrical version could use more character development so i look forward to the directors cut, but still bears the Ridley Scott stamp of reaching into your gut and pulling them out to stamp on an ethical message.
B0086700CM|5.0|i cant believe temple run is finally on kindle fire! i love it on my ipod, but the screen is so tiny. so excited to play it. really slow download though...
1594744769|3.0|This was a book that I had walked past hundreds of times. I have read the synopsis, and I have read the reviews, and yet I still walked past it when I saw it at bookstores. But then one day, I picked it up, I flicked through it and I was fascinated by the photographs and the premise of the novel.<br /><br />From the synopsis of the book, I expected something a little darker, scarier and more dangerous perhaps - almost like Maureen Johnson's \\"The Name of the Star\\". However, I came to the realization that it is a mystery novel based on adventure and fantasy. The photographs definitely helped this book a lot, the photography is great, and the images are haunting in their quality (almost reminded me of those photographs in Nicole Kidman's \\"The Others\\").<br /><br />The title of this book is not the most gripping, which is one of the reasons I kept walking past it. It almost gave it the air of being a children's book (perhaps because I kept reading the word children? I don't know). But when I hear children, and orphanage, I automatically think of Annie or Oliver Twist. However, I do like peculiar, and this definitely had a big dose of peculiar.<br /><br />The story surrounds a teenage boy, Jacob Portman, who grew up listening to his grandfather's otherworldly stories. As a child, Jacob wanted so much to believe everything his grandfather told him, but as he grew up into a young man, reality started to seep in. His grandfather's stories became a source of embarrassment, and he tried to detach himself from them, but also tried to bring his grandfather into his normal, ordinary life. Then, the unexpected occurs: his grandfather dies a gruesome death leaving Jacob a coded message. No one saw his grandfather's killer - that is no one but Jacob. He therefore takes it upon himself to find out what his grandfather meant by the message he had left him, and to finally put his grandfather's mysterious past to rest.<br /><br />Throughout the journey, Jacob discovers himself in more ways than he could have ever imagined - leaving him in a peculiar state of affairs.<br /><br />What happens next? I cannot tell you, as I do not know myself.<br /><br />I was a little put off and confused by the ending, as there seems to be a second installment. I was not aware that this was part of a bigger series, but it seems like it.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs has left us with quite an unfinished story. Once I reached the end, I felt like this entire book was merely one HUGE introduction to what is yet to come.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read countless romance stories, but Beautiful Disaster is my all time favorite. Anyone who likes a good love story involving the \\"bad boy/player\\" type will love this.<br /><br />hmmm where to start... There was something irresitable about the story that I made not be able to put it down. The story is about Two people who have an undeniable attraction towards eachother but are very different which creates underlying problems.<br /><br />This book displays a lot of \\"hot and cold\\" emotions with these characters. One minute I loved Abbey the next I just wanted to say: WTF ARE YOU DOING!?...Same goes for Travis.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of that was bad was the proof reading and editing, which wasn't even that distracting.<br /><br />bottom line would i read it again? YES, i loved this story and how it was told.<br />Would i suggest it to a friend? YES! I gave it 5 stars which is very rare for me.<br /><br />Thank you Jamie McGuire for writing such a heart melting story!

B007X15GRQ|4.0|I am a Mark Wahlberg fan.Goes without saying. I rented this movie thru Amazon fully expecting to see your typical action movie. I was wrong. Got a short lesson in the dirty side of smuggling. While it does not dwell on right or wrong, it does show a little about why/how and the efforts of goverments to stop it. A few twists and turns really spiced it up and reminded me of the Italian Job with surprises. Acting was intense and well done by everyone.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Good read. Great conclusion to a good series. Interesting twists and turns. Also liked insight into how good governments. Can go wrong.
B007VGXS8M|3.0|I thought this game would be like the original  Where's  Waldo but it's  not. There are still a lot of puzzles for this seek and find game. I overall enjoyed it...a little on the easy side but still liked it.
B007L96VCY|5.0|I loved this album when it first came out and still do, I would listen to it all the time and I'm doing it all over again. It was and still is one of my favourite Paul McCartney albums.  This beatle took an awful lot of undeserved flax for his initial foryer into post beatle music, \\"McCartney\\" commonly referred to at that time as the Cherry Album. Lits be honest here, at least this album wasn't a downer, simplistic, yes, but not a downer, it too had its great songs \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" comes to mind immediately.<br /><br />His next album Ram, was in my opinion WOW, a happy album with great sound and sing along songs, Too many people, Uncle Albert, Monkberry Moon delight, Eat at home are just a few of the gems on this album. What more could you ask for.  I bought the re-mastered album just the other day and I haven't stopped listening to it since. I find myself singing along at the top of my lungs to songs which I haven't heard for such a long time having lost the original vinyl. Basically speaking I'm having a blast.<br /><br />So if you like upbeat music and sing along songs pick it up you certainly wont be dissappointed, if you have youg kids they will love it as well.  The re-mastered sound is nothing short of Awesome.<br /><br />So, RAM ON, singalong and have a great time.<br /><br />JB
0143034901|5.0|I had the beautiful opportunity to read this work of art while vacationing in Barcelona - I don't know which I loved more, the city or the book. Together they will forever be intertwined and cherished in my memory. I'm very thankful for the experience - althought to clarify, I'd recommend this invigorating,ferocious read to anyone - anytime and any place!
B0086700CM|2.0|I like the game its really addicting don't get me wrong but every time I make a turn it freezes for like a second. This throws me off track and when I jump, slide or turns it does the exact opposite it is so frustrating

B0086213XW|2.0|Margo (Michelle Williams) meets Daniel(Luke Kirby) at a Colonial re-enactment, and they encounter each other again at the airport, en route to their Montreal home. By happenstance, they also happen to be neighbors. Margo is almost instantly drawn to Daniel, yet having to remind herself that she is married to Lou (Seth Rogan). As days go by, Margo's interest in Daniel turns to infatuation.<br /><br />In a word, almost everything about this movie is forced. The married woman \\"following her heart\\" to pursue an affair outside the marriage and have it painted from the \\"a woman's heart is an ocean\\" point of view is now a tired Hollywood cliche. The chemistry between Rogan and Williams, as well as Kirby and Williams, was also forced. The script was subpar, to me. I never got a sense of WHY the marriage was strained, WHY Margo was attracted to Daniel, etc.<br /><br />Seth Rogan's casting as the dramatic lead is questionable, although he does display some occasional dramatic chops. I admire that he is following a path similar to Jim Carrey and Robin Williams, in that they launched their career with comedy, but transitioned successfully into starring dramatic roles, as well. At this point, I simply don't see Rogan as more than the guy who steered the ship for several Judd Apatow films. That said, he showed me enough promise that I would be willing to give him another shot if he is cast in a different dramatic role. Michelle Williams is great, but I am coming to the belief that she is Clooney-esque in that she has limited range, but what she does, she does extremely well. While all the performances were good, Sarah Silverman's casting as Geraldine, Lou's sister who is struggling with demons of her own, was surprisingly good. Stamped with Silverman's trademark crass tongue, she was the most unexpected casting choice that worked the best.<br /><br />The pacing of this film is very, very slow. It takes a while to get moving in one particular direction, and I felt an unnecessary amount of time was used setting up Lou and Margo's life, and more specifically, Margo's. There are slight shades of 'Blue Valentine' here, minus the emotional grip that film possessed.<br /><br />While 'Take This Waltz' has some great moments, it is not as a whole a great movie. It left me emotionally unsatisfied, maybe because I found the characters difficult to engage in emotionally. It is a movie that is unsure where it wants to go, and unsure how to get there.mount of time was used setting up Lou and Margo's life, and more specifically, Margo's.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|Prepare yourself for a series of deranged, immature, and chauvinistic characters, a lackluster plot verging on non-existence, and a relationship so unhealthy and co-dependent that it borders on abusive. At first I thought the author was making an ironic statement about the expectations of relationships as portrayed by the media, but I soon realized my mistake. I am a die-hard romantic, but love has nothing to do with the idea that one \\"belongs\\" to another person, that one \\"depends\\" on another person, and that one is unfulfilled or worthless without their partner. I have never before been so disgusted with a cast of characters.
B0086700CM|5.0|today there are 16 wrong people who gave it 1star. ddbox says it doesn't work on the kindle fire.

I say its better on kindle fire than android, ipod, iphone, and even ipad.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I started playing this because I thought it would be like cityville. I was totally charmed at first because the graphics were great, the characters were cute and it didnt take a whole lot of waiting and begging like cityville. So far I have played it about a month, and they have lost one creature that I got for completing a set, and one creature I won from the daily game on there. Both aardvarks. I filed a ticket OVER A MONTH ago, and for the first two weeks got only messages from various people telling me I need to reboot and they are sure that will fix the issue. Like I am an idiot. Then, after two weeks of frustrated emails, I finally get an email saying \\"we are investigating your problem and will contact you shortly\\". really? Its like I told an insurance company the mona lisa was in my garden shed when it caught fire- its a game, the critters are one step away from being imaginary, so why not just be like zynga, and replace my stuff? its been three and a half weeks since I got that email! Also I let them know I had to CONSTANTLY reupdate in order to visit other villages and I was not getting quest credit for visiting, its been 5 weeks. Do they have to fly to my village and question all the critters? I actually think that would have been faster.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|\\"Underneath\\" is a beautiful song, sung exquisitely, with great beauty of tone and emotion--and power.  Adam has a great, great voice and this song displays it in its fullness.  There are no bad songs on the album. And there are lots of good beats. \\"Kickin' In\\" is the ultimate club song, essentially a remix of itself. \\"Outlaws of Love\\" is the other ballad on the album, also beautiful.  I personally like \\"Broken English,\\" and \\"Trespassing\\" is another fun club song. Again, no bad songs, but the album is very different from his first, which was very eclectic.  The interesting thing to me is what a fine songwriter Adam is, compared to other current pop artists, not to mention other American Idol recording artists.  That's not what I would have expected, based on his run on American Idol, and his being known essentially as a spectacular vocalist and performer. Good for him. He pretty much puts the other American Idol contestants to shame, even Carrie Underwood, who has had some fine releases (and I am not a fan of country music, but credit where it's due).  Still, \\"Underneath\\" is worthy of Whitney Houston/Mariah Carey classic status. Times have changed, but the song is impressive.

After I finished reading this book it haunted my thoughts for about a week.  It emotionally rocked me to the point where I didn't think I could read it again, but here I am reading it for the second time only two weeks later.  I am hooked on this story and I see they are already making a movie out of it.

B0000A0DRY|1.0|The music remains as gorgeous and inventive as ever. The remastering job, however, was terrible. It wasn't compressed to a fare-thee-well as some reissues are, but *something* made it sound harsh and wearying. I know the LP didn't sound like that. Maybe they used too heavy a hand with noise reduction? In any case, BMG should go back and do it again, this time with no fancy processing -- just a straight transfer of the tape.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game!!! I was waiting forever for this game to come on android devices! everyone should get this game!

B00003CXD0|5.0|I find this movie so satisfying because the movie distracts me from one of my darkest moments and gives me hope. It lightens me up when I'm not feeling well and makes me laugh. Tootsie lightens me up and takes my mind off my problems. The main message of the movie is to BE YOURSELF! Dustin's character begins to realize how tough the struggles of a woman are. Dustin's character becomes aware of what it means to live in a woman's skin. It crosses the boundaries in ways that other movies don't with an old school interpretation. There are some timeless lines in this work of art and what every viewer will see in this movie is the opportunity to see deeper meanings on the nature of love and relationships.
B00785P2QC|4.0|cool game but to many facebook post requests. would give a 5 star review otherwise.  not a  game i would pay for but u almost have to in oreder to move to higher level

B0040Z9H5K|2.0|Sequels are always tricky, and I was happy to see they didn't try to take the, bigger, louder, more boom direction that most do.  However, what happened to Tony?  Yes, he was a rich jerk in the first, but it was entertaining.  After his experience of being kidnapped and held hostage, he was interesting and you find yourself rooting for him, and he was still entertaining, they didn't change his personality, just changed the direction.<br /><br />The second film, however, I mostly just wanted to punch him.  Everything good about Tony dissapeared in this movie.  I didn't like him, at all.  What in the movie did Tony do that was positive in any way?  So glad they got him back on track in the Avengers movie.  Worried about IM3...<br /><br />Also, what was with the dialogue?  Every conversation in this film is the actors talking over each other, and without the subtitles on my DVD, I had no idea what anyone was saying, as it was all jumbled together.  And Hammer?  PUH-LEESE.  I get that he was supposed to be annoying and obnoxious, and... well he did it excellent, but why was that needed?  Every line he had was pointless.  Also, really?... With Stark out of the picture the only weapons developer left in the country was one who couldn't actually develop weapons?  Why would he even be IN the business if he was total fail?  We're capatilists people!  Why was there no competiton?<br /><br />All-in-all, it's worth seeing just because of the franchise, but it failed to deliver an enjoyable film or any likable characters.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a<br /><br />@ super game  i like it'the game is very interesting  my family love it ice age village is cool game bye bye
0060936223|5.0|I love how this book is written so tenderly and with such honesty and clarity.  It is not a book that makes you weep throughout - it doesn't focus specifically on death until the end - it's more like a memoire of their youth in NYC when they were full of hope and experimentation.  But it ends very, very touchingly.  Such a beautiful little book.
B002EAS16E|5.0|5 stars and rightly so!! I've owned this since its release and its still one of the best I own.

B0086700CM|3.0|I have been waiting so long for it to come out, so I was super excited when it did! the only bad thing is is that it has glitches after you get so far and you cannot go any father because it freezes. It is also impossible to finish your objectives because of the cconstant glitches. I would rather play it on the itouch!
0307730697|5.0|Timing was perfect; I received my copy of Fearless by Eric Blehm the Friday before Memorial Day.  The book is a biography about Adam Brown.  The author does an excellent job of not sugar coating the remarkable story of this courageous man.  The author first drills down into Adam's childhood to find how he was raised and what made him tick.  You could tell that at an early age he is destine to do something great.  Then you find out he is human and made a critical mistake that would haunt him the rest of his life, he got addicted to drugs.  At that time, his girl friend and future wife tried repeatedly to get him to quit.  Renewing his faith he digs deep to see that he should do to straighten out his messed up life.  He is introduced to the Navy Seal's and is driven to secede as a Special Forces member.  Even after he loses the sight in one eye, has four of his finger cut off, and replaced he still had the drive, determination and skill to make it into the elite of all Special Forces.  Adam Brown reminds us just how proud we should be for all the men and women who serve out great country.  His unselfish dedicated that eventually took his life should be a story told for generations to come.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah in exchange for my honest review of the book.

B000SEJHRA|5.0|Naya Rivera recommended this book in People Magazine. I loved it. I have never laughed out loud at any book and this book was really funny.  I got some strange looks from my coworkers when I read in the break room at work. I snorted, giggled and chortled with abandon! I will have to find out how to get in touch with Naya to see what she's reading now. She knows how to pick good books!
0141197692|5.0|These Penguin classics are so beautifully designed.  They are a pleasure to look at, and a joy to read.  The ribbon bookmark is a very nice touch, too.  I am enjoying everything about these books and will continue to look for titles that I don't have.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've never played this type of game before and found the directions easy to follow. I do suggest that you read the tips. I was tapping away for a while before I discovered the multiple select feature. I play this on my kindle fire and advise a stylus, but I have been able to successfully play 20x20 puzzles while still seeing (mostly) the entire thing. I find that turning to landscape helps.<br />One of the higher quality FAOTD games that I have gotten!
0345803485|1.0|Two types of books sell - porn and good writing.  While light on plot and writing, heavy on the porn.  If you want a good, well written trilogy with dashes of excellent porn, check out A. N. Roquelaure's (Ann Rice) Sleeping Beauty Trilogy. Those are novels that are hard to put down.

B002VPE1WK|1.0|After 6 months, it is breaking down.  I own the Canon Deluxe Backpack.  When it came time to purchase another one, I selected the Amazon Black version thinking it was just like the Canon one but I liked the fact it was basic black with no \\"expensive\\" DSLR marking.  The problem with the Amazon backpack is it doesn't hold up.  The zipper was the first thing to have problems.  Then the velcro inside weaken so it wasn't strong enough and my zoom lens banged around. I have gone back to using my Canon backpack and this is backup.  Don't waste your money.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting! I already have this game on my iPhone so I was excited to see this app available for the Kindle Fire. I definitely recommend.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book mainly to see what everyone was talking about.I am glad I did.Besides the erotica parts it was a really good story line I liked the fact that while she was completely spell bound by him she didn't just go into his contract blindly and she made compromises on a lot of issues that she was no comfortable with.I wanted James to get into Christian's touching and commitment mental issues.He has a lot of them...hopefully the next book will get into more detail about it.<br />The emails cracked me up.They were cute and I  think they added a lighter tone to the book instead of it just being about the amount if sex that is in this book.(which is a lot)I really do hope that James has written the next books in a way that both Ana and Christian work out there issues and get together in the end.
0439023521|5.0|Have you been caught up in the hype about the Hunger games trilogy? You should be. The series is a well written, disturbing saga of the dystopian world of Panem, whose totalitarian Capital controls it's twelve districts with harsh and cruel practices. The major device is the annual Hunger Games for which each district sends a male and female tribute to fight to the death. In return for participating in the games, food and other supplies are made available to the districts.<br /><br />The disturbing heart of the saga brings you to face the cost of survival. What are you willing to do to secure survival for yourself, for your family unit, individual family members and other human beings. Suzanne Collins' characters face this question on every page of the three novels. Her flawed characters don't always make the decision you want. The pace is so fast for both the characters and you the reader that bad choices are bound to happen.<br /><br />The trilogy is a painful illustration of Lord Acton's quote, \\"Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" This concept of absolute corruption drives Collins' plot, keeping the reader thinking, it can't get any worse than this, only to find it does. It makes the books hard to put down and opens the door for sleepless nights.<br /><br />History shows dictators always forget how strong the will to survive is in humans. It can be harnessed for a time, but it will break through eventually. And even in the most tightly controlled regimes there are cracks that can be exploited.<br /><br />Although the saga comes to a true conclusion, it didn't bring me peace. The Hunger Games trilogy is a beautiful and ugly depiction of the human spirit. It's not for the faint at heart.

It's takes a look at the slavery issue at the beginning of our country, while tackling the race issue in a unique way through it's main character.  It is also a book about sacrifice and hope.  I enjoyed it very much.

B007P6VM04|1.0|Let me begin by saying I have no right to review this CD since I have not purchased it. But the reason I have not purchased it is because I am waiting for release of a CD that actually includes ALL of the songs written for the fictional Broadway show \\"Bombshell.\\" Judging from these reviews, I am not alone. What about it, producers? Will you give us what we want?

0553801473|3.0|I tore through the other books but it took me a year to read this one.  Why?  Because, as others have said, it moves verrrry slowwwwly.  I didn't totally hate the book, though, as it did bring back some of my favorite characters.  And in the last 100 pages the plot finally moved a bit.  But it was a long, hard slog.  I don't know if the HBO series will eventually get to Dance With Dragons but it's hard for me to imagine viewers would be interested in 10 episodes of this stuff.

B0086700CM|5.0|I learner that there was a cheat on this game. You have to put on the tutorials than start playing. When the first turn comes you have to slide your fingers twice but really fast. Once you did that (and if it worked) than your character should be running straight without stopping.  Besides the cheat it's a really fun game!!!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I received this blu ray from Amazon on Friday. Listened to it Friday night, then again Saturday night. Great video, great sound, great show. I may watch part of it again tonight.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|The movie is awesome.  Robert Pattinson did a great job of portraying a sleazy, manipulative, ambitious, power-hungry guy.  The rest of the cast was also great, but as already established actors with great credentials, that was not a surprise.  Pattinson, however, was a very nice surprise and did a great job of portraying a predominantly unlikeable character in a way that made Georges Duroy much more sympathetic and not quite so evil as he was in the book.  I was impressed also with the quality of the streaming video, this being my first rental from Amazon.  Since I live in a small Southern city, this movie will not be shown in any theaters in the area, so this was the only way I could see the movie until it comes on on DVD. Thanks for offering this option, and I will definitely be using Amazon.com instant videos again.
B007JRU4N0|4.0|It was so nice to watch a movie where the characters developed and grew as a family! It would've been a good movie to watch with older children (teen agers) except for the constant profanity. The background drama, which was about the descendents of the original european settlers, was very interesting. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It was visually beautiful and satisfying.
B00828HWJE|3.0|Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a minor role as the prison mentor for Mr. Hong (Cung Le)...\\"There are two tigers inside you.\\" These are seen as occasional flashbacks. Mr. Hong rents an apartment in an Hispanic neighborhood of St. Jude and immediately draws attention to himself. He attempts to pit two gangs against each other (both work for Mr. V (Peter Weller) although does so rather poorly as he leaves a calling card with an oriental symbol for change. But wait...that is all part of the master plan. Mr. V also controls the local cops (Craig Walker, Kristopher Van Varenberg).<br /><br />Rosanna (Crystal Mantecon) plays the straight honest daughter of the landlord.<br /><br />Mr. V. recruits Mr. Hong to work for him. The film has some questionable plot points...such as why Mr. Hong was allowed to live so many times. It utilizes grindhouse style music and introduces characters with written screen titles, however the film doesn't quite flow lie a good grindhouse, either by design or poor editing.<br /><br />F-bomb, sex, nudity (stunt double Arielle Zimmerman)
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|My boyfriend - age 56 - who likes sports message movies and spy/war stuff actually liked this movie.  I love Justin Timberlake's understated performances and Mila Kunis... be still my hetero heart.  The message about friendship making for strong relationships because you can be open if you are not worried about breaking a heart or breaking up, is very good for the 'hooking up' generation to hear.  The dialog is great.  All in all, a wonderful movie that I may actually watch a second time (I generally watch movies only once).
B003UESJDI|5.0|This is not your usual romantic comedy. This one includes tales of mischief and adultery in a small English village. Tamara Drewe (Gemma Arterton), the town's ugly duckling has returned home after her mother has died to make the house ready for sale. She is a successful journalist who has been transformed with a nose job. The neighbor,  Nicholas Hardiment (Roger Allam) is a successful novelist. He and his wife (Tamsin Greig) run a country retreat for a variety of authors who come for the peace and quiet. Glen (Bill Camp) writes about the life of Thomas Hardy, a life we find ourselves comparing to Hardiment.<br /><br />Tamara has her choice of lovers, both old and new. These include rock drummer teenage heart throb Ben (Dominic Cooper) and her old boyfriend Andy (Luke Evans) who dumped her when her nickname was \\"beaky.\\"<br /><br />The movie was quirky and enjoyable. Mischief maker Jody (Jessica Barden) and fan of Ben provides us with the wild card excitement.<br /><br />F-bomb, brief sex, rear nudity

Recently purchased my first blu-ray player, so upgrading my old DVD copy to this newly released edition in blu-ray was a no brainer...and it does not disappoint. Picture quality is sharp and clear, and the audio quality is excellent.<br /><br />The only version I've ever watched has been the directors cut, so I can't comment on the difference between it and the theatrical release.<br /><br />A very entertaining movie, and highly recommended. 4.5 stars...
B007CKNX28|5.0|It is so refreshing to hear new music mastered so tastefully and not giving in to the \\"Loudness Wars\\". The rawness of Jack White's brilliance is perfectly captured in Blunderbuss. Even listening to the CD version harks back to the warm sound of vinyl. This is to hoping more bands follow Jack White's lead.
0393320928|4.0|While this book isn't quite on the same level as its predecessor, Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman, fans of the first Feynman autobiography will still find plenty to enjoy. With a considerable chunk devoted to the investigation into the space shuttle Challenger tragedy, there is a little less lighthearted fare here. But there is certainly no less intrigue.<br /><br />Bottom line: read \\"Surely You're Joking\\" first. If you find that irresistible, this book should be next on your list.
0743437497|5.0|A century old hotel. A writer and his family, who need a new start. Dark secrets to be told. At the Overlook Hotel, Jack Torrance and his wife and son, take on a job to keep it in prime condition throughout the winter. Strange, unexplainable events occur, and life as they know it changes. The Shining is a magnificent thriller written by Stephen King and is arguably one of his best books. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes books that exhilarate the senses and the mind.<br /><br />This is a story of Jack Torrance, an alcoholic who hasn't had a drink in almost a year. He is  writer and teacher. He was fired from his job after he brutally beat a student when that student slashed his tires. He goes to the Overlook Hotel, recommended by a friend, for the winter maintenance job offered there. While there he hopes to finish a play he is writing. His wife Wendy sees the Overlook as a way to begin new, like a flower in Spring. She is very faithful to her husband who she loves dearly, and yet is always wary of him and his anger because of the past. Now this is when we bring in their son, Danny. Danny, or commonly referred to as doc, is a very special child. He is very thoughtful and smart, but there is something different about Danny. He has the \\"Shining\\". The ability to read thoughts, know how people around him are feeling, and see things that no one else can see. The story doesn't actually get going until the Torrances actually get to the hotel and close it down for the winter. One day when Jack is out on the hotels playground after trimming the hedge animals, he turns to see the hedges have changed position. \\" And the lions-(oh no, baby, oh no, uh-uh, no way) the lions were closer to the path. The two on his right had subtly changed positions, had drawn closer together. The tail of the one on the left now almost jutted out over the path. When he had come past them and through the gate, that lion had been on the right and he was quite sure its tail had been curled around it.\\" Earlier in the book, the cook Hallorann told Danny that he must not enter room 217. He also said that the things in the hotel were like pictures, and that if you closed your eyes hard and long enough they would go away......what \\"things\\" could be in room 217? We all know curiosity killed the cat. So of course the one place Danny couldn't stay away from was, you got it, room 217.<br /><br />You probably could've guessed that he would go in the room, but never would you have guessed what he saw in there. No spoilers are allowed so I can't tell you what happens, but when I read it I felt as though I was in the room experiencing the phenomenon that occurred in that room. I was so afraid when I read that section that I could feel the the little spike of adrenaline that comes from the facing of the unknown. I could picture clearly that moment in my head so vividly that I almost thought it was real. This is very typical of Stephen King, to keep every little minute detail in his writing so it feels like a nonfiction story because of how real it is. When Jack goes to room 217 to see why Danny had \\"nearly gone catatonic\\" the same thing happens and he starts to think \\"He closed his eyes and all the old phrases began to parade through his mind, it seemed like there must be hundreds of them, (cracking up not playing with a full deck lostya marbles guy just went looney tunes he went up and over the high side went bananas lost his football crackers nuts half a seabag) all meaning the same thing: losing your mind.\\" The way he describes events and characters puts other authors to shame. I'm not sure if i feel more alive in real life or in his books. But this one is by far my favorite book to read. Its like a mix between the insanity of Christine (another book by him about a demonic Cadillac) and the realistic fright of Misery (yet another book by him about an author who gets stranded at the house of his biggest fan who tortures him to make him stay).<br /><br />If I had to rate this book (I really don't want to) I would give it a ten out of ten, or a five out of five or however high the scale goes to. This is positively the greatest book I have ever read. I nearly went insane just reading it. Some people would probably say this book should be burned, others might swear by it, but me personally, I salute Stephen King for being able to write such a mind-bending book and masterpiece. That's all there is to it.
1934648035|5.0|For someone like me who loves a book that puts me in a peaceful mood and brings me to a good place, Siddhartha is one of my all-time favorites. You're not going to find endless action, shocking plot-twists, or gut-busting comedy. What you will find is a simple, beautiful, poetic story about life, desire, and happiness.<br /><br />Note: I have seen many people mention this particular translation is problematic. I cannot comment on that as I have not read this one. I am simply reviewing the story, which I read a few years ago in another edition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A nice, well done, and fun game. I found no glitches, and the animation is well done without being annoying.
0061339202|3.0|I remember seeing a review for this book that said you could pretty much summarize what it has to say in a few sentences and save yourself the time of reading over 300 pages.<br /><br />I think that's a legitimate criticism in that Flow feels more like a research paper than a book in its scope, and it really does make all of its salient points within the first few chapters. But to be fair, the rest of the book is still interesting and enjoyable, if not filled to the brim with new insights. The fact is that Flow presents information that may be very applicable to all of our lives. Some readers may need the full extent of the book to gather enough elaboration and real-world examples to feel like they can put the principles in action for themselves. Others may find it repetitive and unnecessary.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: the concepts presented in Flow are no doubt important for us to address in our lives, and even if it is much longer than it has to be, it's still far easier to read than the author's last name, which I probably still couldn't pronounce in the time it took for me to finish the book.

This book provides a glimpse into a man who was clearly far more than just a brilliant scientist--one of the most brilliant scientists the world has ever seen, in fact.<br /><br />I don't need to write a long review, as plenty of other people have gone into detail on the specifics of this book. All I can say is that if you are even slightly intrigued by this man and even vaguely interested in learning more about him, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman will deliver with flying colors on both informing and entertaining you. This is not a book about science; this is a book about the life of a man who knew how to live like the best of them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so excited that this game finally came out for the kindle fire!!All those stupid games were put on there but they stunk but this one dose not at all!!add on to it I want to see your opinion about my review.
0670022411|4.0|Starting out, I expected not to like this book.  I'm not sure why - I just had a \\"bleh\\" feeling about reading it.  Maybe it was the length.  Maybe it was my fondness for smutty novels (which this absolutely is NOT).  Maybe because it was assigned to me as part of a book club (and I generally dislike authority *grin*).  Whatever the reason, I am SO GLAD I stuck this out and committed myself to reading it!  I was told this before I started, and I'm verifying it now by passing it on: unless you are the scholarly type who enjoys hanging out in libraries, the first quarter of the book is slow.  Very methodical.  Very Diana Bishop, actually, who is the first-person voice for the story.  I skimmed much of the pre-Matthew chapters, which I wouldn't actually recommend because I missed out on some critical information and had to go back and re-read.  That said, once I realized there was a relationship blooming between Diana and Matthew (I went into this with as little information as possible), it was  much easier reading.  What can I say?  I'm a sucker for romances!  =)<br /><br />'A Discovery of Witches' (ADoW) is The Da Vinci Code meets The Fellowship of the Ring (complete with three subnovels, albeit unlabelled as such), The Pillars of the Earth meets Angels and Demons.  If the Twilight Saga (TTS) weren't obviously written and released first, I'd think *it* was a teenage adaptation of *this* book, minus the witches and daemons.  I know, *GASP!!*, but hear me out and think about it.  There are many similarities between ADoW and TTS: the forbidden relationship between a vampire and his human love & the war that ensues, the families closing ranks to protect them and wage that war, the evil council determined to pry them apart (for political gain & maneuvering) by any means possible, the slow pace of the sexuality in the relationship and the prospect of a child who is like neither and both parents, the frail heroine who grows into her own strength and power so she can protect her mate and family.<br /><br />ADoW has a fairly deep cast of characters, in both the sheer number of them and the level of development given to some of the secondaries.  Many romance-centric novels focus on the hero and heroine to the detriment of most of the other players.  Ms. Harkness skillfully weaves in enough personality and details about many of the secondary characters to help the reader accept them as an integral part of the story.  As the book goes on, it becomes more of an ensemble cast (including the house itself!), providing a nice warm fuzzy family base for the primary couple.<br /><br />Aside from the strange mix of first-person and omniscient narration (which is ideal for the characters' individual personalities), the scientific talk of DNA and such was just understandable enough to be interesting without being offputting.  There were some thought-provoking passages during the DNA discussions and explanations, alluding to things like how our lifestyles and choices throughout our evolution directly affect our DNA mutations as a species across time.  That's some high-brow stuff and should be discouraging to many people who aren't schooled in that science, but I found Ms. Harkness expressed these ideas clearly & simply enough so that I could both follow along and still make my own leaps of thought.<br /><br />'A Discovery of Witches' is cleverly compelling and affectionately engrossing.  It is a rediscovery of the senses and the intellect, a celebration of indulgence through science.  This is the kind of story that can inspire a new generation of aspiring scholars or speculative conspiracy theorists.  It tugs at the heart strings with a cast of characters and plotline that is rich in such diversity of race, nationality, sexuality, and culture that it's nearly impossible not to enjoy.<br /><br />I would like to give this novel 4.75 or 5 stars, but the first quarter put me to sleep a few times until I finally got into it.  In light of that, I'll give ita solid 4.5 stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up.  With all the curveballs Ms. Harkness sent our way and with all the new possibilities that opened up in the final chapters, I can't wait to see what happens next!a solid 4.5 stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up.  With all the curveballs Ms. Harkness sent our way and with all the new possibilities that opened up in the final chapters, I can't wait to see what happens next!
B0086700CM|5.0|All I can think is getting a higher score. It's amazing. Five stars to the makers. I love this.<br />It's a really great game, if you're in to games like Doodle Jump that have no real purpose or levels, but they are awesome and addictive and entertaining all the same.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad they finally have this game for the kindle fire. :) best game. It's fun-filled and addicting.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this app but and its fun and all but whenever I turn it ends up sliding off the edge. But otherwise I think it is a very good app that you should buy. I reccomend it
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this game to come on the kindle fire .... now I am so so so so so so happy.!
B005FVNJTS|5.0|An amazing read. One does not have to be a sports fan to have the opportunity to be enlightened on the life and family of Raffa, as well as the team which is a necessity for a famous identity.
B0086700CM|5.0|I almost died when I saw this app!!!! but I didn't because then I couldn't PLAY IT!!!!!!Awesome app. a must have!!!!:)

B005HSL626|5.0|ummmmmm, this is a fantastic app. I love that I have the full verison &amp; I didn't have 2 pay 4 it
B005VT42BS|5.0|Very useful set of tools for mobile devices. Not as powerful as having, say, a full Linux laptop, but good for quickly finding trouble spots or doing some basic discovery on a network. Seems to identify most devices fairly easily, but it isn't familiar with Broadcom, it seems.
B006LM6P0K|5.0|Loved this movie. There aren't very many movies made that the whole family can watch together. There was no cussing and no sexually explicit scenes.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Decent looking backgrounds and a good set of widgets. Works with both my Droid Charge and Acer Iconia A500. Could be a little more responsive, and adding locations is sometimes a little wonky.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the best game ever and its free! This game is so addicting and I cant put it down!! So happy they finally got it for kindle fire!! BEST GAME EVER!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I can't get enough of this keyboard. Swiftkey is by far the best experience I've had with a mobile keyboard, bar none. Predictions tend to be accurate (if a little weird without training) and fast, and the themes go nicely with most devices. Looking forward to official release of Swiftkey 3.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I enjoy Jane Austen homage books.  But this one lacked a point of view.  We knew who P&P was about.  But this just lacked emotion.  When one of the primary characters surrounding the death is indited we don't even get any type of description of his reaction, after hearing all about his demeanor coming into the hearing?  That was a strangely missed opportunity to get a view into the characters frame of mind.  Overall I was simply disappointed.
B006VRZ5YM|5.0|OH MY GOD FUNNY!! MY HUSBAND WAS LAUGHING AT THIS MOVIE AS MUCH AS I WAS!!!  I AM NOT REALLY A SNL WATCHER BUT THIS WAS HILARIOUS!!  MUCH FUNNIER THAN BABY MOMMA
B0085776BG|3.0|The Tuskegee Airmen from 1995 was a lot better.  I didn't feel that the acting was genuine in this movie.    [...]
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I love this trilogy. I couldn't put the books down and now that I have finished them I find myself longing for more!! Guilty pleasure. I miss Christian Grey :(
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I felt dirty after reading this book, needless to say I didn't purchase the other two, call me a prude but I just did not enjoy reading about a woman being beat down sexually by a man. That is not my fantasy. Give the guy a toliet brush and apron....now were talking :)
B00377E5SG|3.0|\\"We were up to our elbows in your underwear drawer, it was like touching the shroud of tourin\\" Haha ha!
B007IE4DT0|5.0|If you want to learn more about the George Harrison music you'll love this album, but if you're new or do not know much of his career perhaps you do not like much the content. This album was armed with unreleased footage, rehearsals and discards of the Harrison family archives. Production work is in charge of Giles Martin, son of George Martin and co-producer of the album Love. Good points is the music of George, which is in its purest form, conveying a feeling all its raw state and mysticism, which outlines what was a really thinking when he's  write, as many of these are nude shots without excessive varnish wall of sound that Phil Spector gave the songs on All Thing Must Pass, a fact that George would regret until his death. Some example are Run of the Mill, Awaiting on you All and My Sweet Lord. Even is also included Let It Be Me a cover of the Everly Brothers which was presumably recorded the night of 1983 in which the duo performed at the Royal Albert Hall as part of their reunion tour, George and the rest of the Beatles were very fans of the Everly Brothers and he's  attended the concert. Mama You've Been On My Mind shows the influence of Bob Dylan was on George and that led them to co-written I'd Have You Anytime. On the negative side the cover does not contain further details of the songs and when this were recorded, only a brief introduction and thanks to the Harrison family by Martin on the back cover. Takes the title Early Takes Volume 1 suggests that there may come a sequel Volume 2, in fact Olivia and Giles Martin have already made it known that it is very likely that this is from in the near future but without pressure.

B006XF5BTG|4.0|This book has opened my eyes to mistakes I have been making in the gym, and with changing my workouts too frequently. The best results Ive had from a workout is I did P90X for a little over a year, and the last 4 months of that year I got the bug to do a Half Marathon. I went from a bulked 210 down to a lean muscular 190. After that year I got bored with the P90X and have tried 2 different workouts, one came out of a magazine, and the one Im currently doing is the Max Fit Rock hard 2012 challenge. Its a 2 month program that consists of hitting each muscle group twice a week, 2 sets of high weight and low reps and a 3rd set of low weight and 20-30 reps, and 1 minute of cardio/calesthetic in between each set. This current workout has me in the gym for about 2 hours and the first month I had great results and everything going well and am halfway through the second month, and now I am just physically and mentally drained out tired all the time, my muscles are harder but size and definition arent really there, and my strength has plateaued. So 2 days ago I bought this book and today I have quit the current workout with 2 weeks left of it, I am going to take a rest week and still diet properly and start what has been laid out in this book. I am currently 195 and not as lean as I was around half marathon november 2011, but I hope to change that soon. I only rated this 4 stars because I do not have results to yet report. When they come I will change the rating. I cant wait to get started!
0385344228|5.0|I am an author myself of two nonfiction books dealing with the courts and sensational murder trials, but books like Landy's reach an emotional territory that cannot be found in such nonfiction. Defending Jacob is beautifully rendered, and as a father of two boys (18, 13) the book just taps into the deep-seeded yet complex relationship we have with our children. The book, while fictionally framed as a courtroom thriller, is much more about that primal connection that connects a father and son. Great fiction has a way of unearthing these eternal human secrets, and Defending Jacob stands in that tradition.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was traveling to Europe and needed a global phone, since my daily phone wouldn't work globally.  My provider (Verizon) didn't lend out global Iphones, but would give me an android.  So, I purchased and put the Accuweather app on the android global phone.  Of course, it was only as good as the mobile phone coverage.  When I had coverage, I got good weather reports with detailed information and I knew what I needed for the day.  Since there was a lot of rain, I was glad to have it, when the phone worked.  It was the app I used the most on my trip.
0375869026|4.0|Here's a rarity these days--a Young Adult novel that features no vampires, no werewolves, no homicidal adolescents, no science fiction, and nothing supernatural at all. It tells a seemingly simple story about extraordinarily ordinary teenagers who are facing the usual adolescent dilemmas and figuring out how to navigate the genuinely frightening real-life traumas of middle school. And it's a great book.<br /><br />August (and yes, the character names in this novel are almost allegorically significant) was born with a severe facial deformity, one that's apparently too gruesome to describe. He's endured a painful and solitary childhood. Until his parents decide that it's time for them to stop homeschooling him and send him to a real school where he can learn things they can't teach him while beginning the excruciatingly challenging process of early adolescent socialization. Auggie encounters the typical kinds of kids you'd expect to find in a middle school--ignorant bullies, sympathetic good-natured kids, confused and conflicted friends.<br /><br />R.J. Palacio tells Auggie's story with great sympathy, but she pulls no punches when it comes to the painful events Auggie has to face--events that would drive most adolescents to tears and exponentially more painful for Auggie, yet he triumphs in ways that are both believable and utterly inspirational. The author uses some very effective narrative techniques (the novel spans one full school year, and the narrative perspective--always rendered in the first-person--shifts numerous times throughout the novel, from Auggie to his sister Via to his friend Summer to his sister's estranged best friend Miranda and back again), and she has captured magnificently the voices of real teenagers.<br /><br />This novel is indeed a wonder in itself--a realistic look at the process of adolescence through the eyes of genuine teenagers, a novel that tells a story that is by turns ordinary and extraordinary but always enjoyable and inspirational.al.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you, You Version for making the Bible accessible for everyone! I have the same app on my phone. I carry God's word with me everywhere!

B005IQZB14|4.0|Dear fellow Gen-Xers: Do you remember the way the world used to be, back in the early 1990s?  Cheryl Strayed's memoir of hiking the PCT is really good in its own right, but, because so much of her story has to do with the logistics of hiking hundreds and hundreds of miles, I was constantly reminded of a world now gone.  The days of pay phones and answering machines, of pre-arranged meetings, of inexplicable breakdowns in package deliveries.  The days when Stevie Ray Vaughn died, when Kurt Cobain died, when Jerry Garcia died.  Do you remember when all you owned was a futon and way too many books and it all fit into your tiny car with enough room left over for your dog or your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your roommate?  When we talked about whether or not we were hippies?  When no-one had heard of REI?  Of Wilco?  When you could sell used books for real money?  Did you live in a house rented from a distant institutional landlord for not very much money and many more than the legal number of residents?  If you had a telephone number it changed all the time?  Address books with friends' names and serial telephone numbers, each one crossed out and absolutely no email addresses?  Did you have friends who made up new last names for themselves when they got married?  Days when you woke up to white curtains moving in the breeze?  That way we felt when we were young but didn't know it?  Do you remember the way you felt, back before you learned better?
B0086700CM|5.0|yes now they have the best game known to man!whoooooooo yessssss best game no mod ripoffs the the truth is such a happy day yes
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is pretty fun.  I would have given it 5 stars except for two things I've had problems with.  One is a quest to visit neighbors; unfortunately they mean \\"your friends\\" not just a neighbor but will give credit for giving a heart.  The second reason is not knowing the time on a egg hatch until after committed to the egg.  I have lost more eggs from that.<br /><br />The 4 stars are how the game will give acorns for free along with free silver coins.<br /><br />It is a pleasant game I like it much better than the Tap series games.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really fun. I give it a 5. the students are being good in order to play with my cello and kindle fire
0553801473|2.0|I think at first GRRM was paid by the book, and probably now he's paid by the page.. So he's putting more and more water in the sauce.<br /><br />I've gone through the last two books only because I got \\"hooked\\" by the first three who were brilliantly written, full of action and DYNAMIC!<br /><br />The last two (crows and dragons) are slowing to an almost standstill... The sad part is that you follow the characters you used to love... but they are now boring and the action's getting sloooooow.<br /><br />We feel like hostages reading the books just because we got addicted to the story, just like a bad movie you keep on watching  just because you want to see the ending; hoping and hoping that it'll get better...<br /><br />If you didn't read it yet, don't start reading the books it will bring you only frustration and anger. Just like the electricity shutting off during your favorite tv series...
B0086700CM|5.0|just got this app today! yay!!! ive been playing it so much I'm actually afraid ill gain weight! lol. its all ive been doing all day. SO glad they came out w/ this 4 kindle. the most addictive game ive played in a long time!  :-)
1600242197|5.0|Narrator can make all the difference great or not great. Kevin T Collins does a great job with this great story. I was riveted especially as you get into the heat of the story. Also good to be reminded how many soldiers do all they can to protect our Freedom. It's an abridged edition but still great. I'll keep this CD set and play it again on another road trip. Recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|I so glad they came out with this game for the fire....I play this game all the time on my moms iphone
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome!I have been waiting for this app for a long time!I'm so addicted to it!I bet you will be to. Get this app its the best in the world!
B0064MT1SA|5.0|This is one of the best movies about an artist or in this case artists that I have ever seen. It is historically acute,visually stunning, intellectually stimulating all awhile you connect her life with her work. You see all these people very accurately, it will make you laugh, cry, hold your breath, be in awe, ETC!!! Treat yourself and own this movie, seeing it once will not satisfy your curiosity about the people in it. Since it is an Art movie, the Blu Ray is even more amazing than the regular CD, so I had to upgrade and am so glad I did!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is game is very fun and can be addictive I'm glad that it can out to all androids!! One of the best games I have played and I love to play games on my tablet often. (fruit ninja is still the best) but temple run right up there with fruit ninja. maybe they can come up with a different version of this for an upgrade &lt;3
B0086700CM|5.0|finally this game!  my dad has had it for a while and i beat him! finally on  kf! any one who has a kindle fire and is sick of the old games this is a great choice
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game. i like how its freeeeeeee :). its fun to play. i dont have to wait long for thing to be done.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like this app. I use evermore, springpad, and another one that slips my mind at moment. but I'm always using evermore on all my devices. I like the simplicity of this app as well as overall layout of evermore.<br /><br />Update...<br /><br />I've been using this app across all my devices, Kindle Fire, Samsung smartphone, Ipod,Pc, and Laptop. I've pretty much stopped using Springpad, due to the fact that Evernote spans across all devices, and the web app works so much better than the Springpad Springit web option.<br /><br />Another plus to Evernote is the growing selection of addons for Evernote. Alot of other apps are using Evernote for collabration between them. The Evernote Vault, i believe it is called has alot of apps for many OS's that are helpful and useful.<br /><br />Now to refer to the TOS of Evernote, it is no different from Springpad, SkyDrive, GoogleDrive, Box, etc. You are storing items in the cloud. The cloud is open for everyone. Evernote does not use your pics, notes, etc for any use at all. This is now a standard TOS for any cloud based service. Take a look at other apps and what they access on your tablet, phone, computer, Ipod, etc. They all access services on your devices. Price of technology advancement.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad this game came out. this is so great that is finally out I got it yesterday. this game is awesome!
B000VSYDRM|4.0|I thought the movie was well done; however, it was a bit slow. The ending was a surprise! I would recommend this film.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is really fun but addicting. the graphics are great . and it can get pretty challenging. you cant beat the price freeeee! !!!!!!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|What a waste of money. The story was weak. The plot was weak. The characters were thin, barely developed, and the dialogue poorly written. The effects (wolves) were amateur. And how many f bombs can they drop in one movie? (As many as 150 or more according to \\"plugged in on line\\". )I won't even give this one star.  Please, please don't waste your time or money on this film. Liam Neeson... how could you?
B007SYWFRM|4.0|my brother found a cheat on options and he won't tell me so I am mad and I can't find it so he is already has  like two million even more and on level 50 so I am very very very MAD so right now I am on level 26 I no just so low my brother is so mean and on level 50:( .  :(.......................................................................
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is one of the most ingeniously done app ever.  It's simpler than sudoku but yet at the same time intellectually challenging (without causing nausea).  Very similar to Sudoku, deductive logic is used to solve where the filled square and the crossed are.  At the end of the game, a pattern is revealed.<br /><br />I don't usually write reviews for apps, but this is so extraordinary yet original that I feel obligated to share the gospel!<br /><br />Yes the price tag is a little steep but for a piece of work of such quality, it is justified.  I do wish the author will come out with more new maps/puzzles over time, to further improve the paid app.<br /><br />Better yet, a puzzle maker allowing the community upload and download to the app would be a great idea as well.
B005LAIHQS|3.0|Aside from the occasionaly entertaining Jones impression by Brolin, which was well done btw, this lacked any reasonable plot and was devoid of the fun n humour that characterized its predecessors. Will Smiths lines and attempts at wit were unimaginative and bland, leaving you feeling cheated of what could have been a funny quote that would be remembered later on. Tommy Lee Jones roll was small, as expected, and left you wondering if he even wanted to be there in the first place. His once hilariously funny straight man personality found in agent K was replaced with a tired, wanting shell of a character that was sleep walking through the set. While I am sure this is what the director was going for, the effects drained out into the theater and had the same drowsy effect on the audience.<br />The constantly deliberate and subtle as a freight train plot felt more like the director was leading a two year old by the hand through the straight maze of a story and he left nothing to the imagination and detective in us all to figure things out for ourselves.<br />The cleaver randomness of MIB 1 and occasionaly 2 was missed by a mile  and substituted with a conglomerate of characters that have nothing to do with each other. From the main villains to the minor, the moment they are liquified from the screen, you forgot everything about them.<br />The major suprise plot ending was nothing more than this movies attempt to come \\"full circle\\" and made no sense at all unless you wanted to completely forget about the first two movies altogether.<br />I give it 2 and a half stars to Josh Brolin alone for a job well done.
B000N90JG8|4.0|When I saw the cast of this movie I didnt know what to think. I am not into chick flicks, so I took a chance on this one and it is one of my favs. Hilariously funny movie all the way to the end. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton were terrific together. Who would have ever thought Jack N could play a romantic yet funny role. I highly recommend this movie.
B002PKZER2|5.0|This CD has alot of rythem and speed. It was clearly inspired by crusades, ancient battles and the honor of man that only few know of and have experianced. It strives you toward victory. A trekie would say \\"It brings out your inner Klingon.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run so much!when I heard it was on the kindlle fire I got it right away so it's awesome!!!!!!!
B000294SFW|3.0|Another Motorhead CD. I will admit there isn't anything special or original about this CD, but it's still a good CD worth entering into any metal collection.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|W.E. is a remarkable achievement by Madonna. Her top stars play the parts of Edward and Wallis to the hilt. I am also happpy with the present day duo. The chemistry of both couples carries the film. I love the story of Wallis and Edward. It gives clear details of what was just a minor blip before on my history screen. Suprised how much she gave up for love.
B0012GMXLU|4.0|Motorhead has proven time and time again that they are timeless. They sound as great today as they did back in the 70's. This is a great CD and I don't understand why some put it down. This has alot of great metal tunes and define metal.
B007REAIUE|5.0|I heard J.D.'s interview on NPR's \\"All Things Concidered\\"([...]) on May 18th, 2012 and I was hooked. I love his style and techniques of delivering a verity of classic style rock 'n roll. I've listen to the album about 20 times since buying it this week and I can't get enough. I hope he cuts another album soon.
B004HD2ZIQ|4.0|Folling Motorizer (which I surprisingly did not care for all that much) this CD reminded me of something important. \\"If it's too loud, then you're too old.\\" This CD prooves that even a man in his 60's can still rock out with the youngest generation. Thank you, Lemmy.
1451648537|5.0|What a great read. I am so impressed with the vision and detail of Steve Jobs! This book describes an incredible, innovative man who sees things from the user's point of view. Simplify. Great design. Wonderful read!
B0086700CM|4.0|Yay Temple Run! Free for kindle fire? Oh yes! I love this game! Only bad thing is it lags if you play it a bunch of times in a row...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A dear friend and I enjoyed this second season of Downton Abby very, very much. We can't wait for the third season. We hope that Amazon will soon offer it for sale. We recommend this wonderful story to anyone that enjoys adventure, intrigue, romance, infidelity, treachery, war and peace.
0345803485|2.0|The constant repetition of tons of phrases and the author's vocabulary in itself ruined this book for me.  Ya, I may not be the intended audience, but I can't see how anybody can read the same few phrases nearly 100 times and not feel like they're reading something written by a child.  In the last 1/4 of the book I couldn't wait for it to end from the sheer repetition.  I mean it repeated so much.  This  book was so repetitive, it was frustrating.  The repetition really grated on me and was noticeable early on and was relentless.  This book was repetitive.  The book could have been whittled down in half, easily, without losing any substance as it was so repetitive.  Easily the most repetitive book I've ever read.  If the repetitive nature of this review drove you nuts, then guess what; you'll hate this book as much as me...
B004ECDNJU|5.0|enjoyed this game very much.  the concept is very unique but very simple and yet challenging.  unlike others I appreciated the time limits on each level because it prevents you from getting in an indefinite holding pattern while slowly solving the puzzle.  I do wish there was time to study level before starting to play because the first few attempts r wasted as you figure out the level layout.  one of my favorite games!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like it. only one that I found is free and easy to use. this is the app you need a weather app. try it and if you don't like it you can delete it
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved this game the iphone, I lurv it even more because its on my Kindle Fire! This is a really fun app!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|The support for this game is non-existent. Opening a support ticket will get you nowhere fast.  Glu has a system for gaining more gold coins (coins you can use across all Glu games, which you need to advance in the games.)  which includes participating in free offers, downloading and playing other Glu games, watching videos, etc.  I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab and so far none of the ways to get free gold will credit your account.  You can also sign up for a Glu account, where you earn \\"Glu credits\\" for doing things as well.  as far as I can research THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO USE FOR GLU CREDITS.<br /><br />Sam Vs Zombies is fun, addictive, and challenging. Especially with the glitches (I can't use any of my healing items).  Even with the developers being lazy good for nothings it has been a worth while download.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever buy it you will love this game if you don't believe me check it out yourself.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|She's back with another one! Yes, more immature pornography, the bafflingly popular Fifty Shades.<br /><br />Though our heroine has only known her young Lothario for a mere few weeks, their parting has wrenched her very soul. She can't eat, she can't sleep, all she can do is cry. How very 14! Well that doesn't last long, because what would this series be without varieties of sexual experience? They do it here, they do it there, they do it everywhere.<br /><br />I just know this series is gonna end with a 13-year-old girl on her computer typing THE END. Turns out she made the whole thing up! How else explain the godawfulness of this story of adults behaving like a young girl's fantasy, imagined before she knows the realities of life?<br /><br />P.S. Is anyone else not able to make Grey's words sound right unless said in a British accent? It just doesn't work otherwise. Too bad he's supposed to be an American.
0345803485|1.0|For some perverse reason, I decided to finish Fifty Shades of Grey. Fortunately, the read was rather quick as I could skim the pages in order to determine the supposed \\"plot line.\\"  I eventually took to highlighting the constant \\"inner goddess\\" or the \\" Holy Crap!\\" refrains, and I wondered if this author had any inkling how tiresome she is.  I would have to say that this is the worst book I have ever read, and I am ashamed of the American public who somehow find this exploration of \\"unusual\\" sex great reading.  Oh my! How low we have sunk; my inner goddess will not allow me to even ask about the remaining two books. Holy Crap!
0307730697|5.0|Just in time for Memorial Day, Waterbrook Press sent me a copy of Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown.  We hear all the time about the men and women of the armed forces in general, the sacrifices they make, and the many ways they preserve freedom around the world.  Fearless tells the story of one such seaman, who gave everything he had every day in the service of his country.<br /><br />Adam grew up in rural Arkansas, the all-American boy, loved by everyone, the athlete who made sure other kids didn't get picked on, the good-looking popular kid who asked the wallflowers to dance, the buddy who never let his buddies down, the fun-loving risk taker who respected authority.  That changed after he graduated from high school; Adam spent several years as a lost soul and ended up hooked on crack and heading to jail.  Through the love of his girlfriend and ever patient and forgiving family and friends, he became stable enough to join the Navy.  A close friend's dad was an officer in the recruiting division; without his recommendation, Adam would probably have been accepted.<br /><br />While he was in prison, Adam became a Christian.  He certainly had some rough times overcoming his addiction, but as a Navy recruit and trainee, as a new husband, as a high-achieving SEAL, and as a father, Adam grew in his faith to the point that his faith in Christ shaped every part of his life.  As a SEAL, Adam excelled in everything he tried.  Even with injuries that would have sidelined many seamen, much less one on top of another as he had (losing an eye, severing several fingers and having them reattached, assorted leg and foot problems), Adam insisted on staying on, having to work extra hard to compensate for his injuries.  He won the admiration of everyone around him for his dedication to his work as a SEAL, his dedication to his family, and his faith.<br /><br />The title of the book refers to Adam's \\"ultimate sacrifice,\\" so I'm giving nothing away by revealing that he was killing in the line of duty.  Blehm does a tremendous job of showing Adam's character, so that the reader mourns right along with his faithful wife and his brothers in arms.  Many of us have know people who have had an untimely death, and whose character and gifts lead us to question God, \\"Why him?  Why now?  Why not that worthless so-and-so next door?  Why take such a great guy, in the prime of life, with young kids at home?\\"  In a story like Adam's, that is even more true.  I have to wonder, is our military's prolonged presence in Afghanistan really worth the lives of more like Adam?  Sure, they're saving lives by hunting down the insurgents and preventing them from building more IEDs.  But they wouldn't be building IEDs if our military wasn't occupying their country!  If, as a fellow SEAL said at Adam's funeral, \\"This is a struggle between the forces that would protect and nourish human dignity and freedom, and those that would destroy it,\\" who can argue against such a struggle.  But when that translates into occupation of another country, of virtually taking over that country's governance, and staying in country with a military presence in the tens of thousands for a decade, it starts to become more murky.<br /><br />In spite of my reservations about U.S. military policy, I can't help but admire Adam and respect his level of commitment to training, the excellence he strove for in his role, the love and commitment he had for his family, and the dedication he showed in turning his life around.  His children were old enough when he died that they will have many good memories of their time with him, but what a gift Eric Blehm as given them in this beautifully written account of their daddy's life.  Adam is a hero his children--not to mention the rest of us--can be proud of and look up to.<br /><br />Thanks to Waterbrook/Multnomah for the complimentary review copy.I'm giving nothing away by revealing that he was killing in the line of duty.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I was in need of a new microphone for my online videos and I had read and heard great things about the Audio-Technica ATR-3350.  It works great for my needs.  It is easy to use.  The only downside is you have to remember to to turn the microphone of after each use as there is no on/off light.  This is a small issue for me so I just order a 10 pack of batteries.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I was hovering between a 3 or 4 star rating for this, but went with 4 as a nod to the actors.  I mean, I was kind of expecting another \\"the Edge\\" and got Twilight instead. Large wolves singularly concerned with pushing a bunch of plane wreck victims to extinction.  Do wolves really behave like this, if so... must... stay... out... of... Alaska! I'm just saying... not the worst movie I've ever seen, but not the best either. I was bordering on \\"the Castaway\\" with Tom Hanks, thinking this man is going INSANE.  And, of course, we would all like a better ending, but real life doesn't always deal that card.  All I know is that there was some great suspense and some \\"ewwwwww\\" moments and my heart actually sped up while I watched certain scenes - so much so I had to pause the movie and suck up some nerve to watch the rest.  Realistically speaking, I don't think I could have survived and I must bow down to the elemental facts of this movie.  I won't be going into anybody's woods... EVER!

B002RWJQO0|5.0|Phillipe Gaston \\"The Mouse\\" (Matthew Broderick) a thief who has escaped the dungeons of Aquila, is a young man trying to come to terms with what is the right path to take in the world and become a better person. He talks to himself and God throughout the film - which makes the humor all the more endearing.  While trying to battle his conscious in the most trying situations, he stumbles across two star-crossed lovers in the midst of an evil Bishop's curse who sold his soul in order to curse the lovers because he could not have Isabeau for himself. Forever together yet eternally apart, Navarre (Rutger Hauer) and Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) have watched over each other since the curse was cast. By day, Isabeau is a beautiful hawk, and at night, a beautiful woman - alone except for Navarre the wolf by night who loves her. As the tale unfolds, Navarre is taking the trio back to Aquila to avenge their honor, when the hawk is injured and only Father Imperius (Leo McKern) the Monk who betrayed them can save the hawk. Together all four are on the quest of a lifetime to set their world to right. The most touching scene in the movie is when they almost touch at daybreak, and the curse moves in just in time to keep the two from even being able to touch.<br />I rate this movie in one of my top 10 as I love this era - with all the chivalry and honor it entailed.  It contained humor, love, and intrigue, all the makings of a well rounded movie. You will no regret giving this movie a chance to enchant you, as it did me.
B0086700CM|5.0|My friends like all have ipods and this game and I wondered if the kindle was the right device for me and when you guys got temple run it made me have hope for more apps amazon will get.  Please get more new ipod apps so I don't regret getting this kindle fire.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|I'm old enough to have seen this film when it was first released. Not only that, I saw it in its first release at a drive-in theater! Imagine that.<br /><br />I hesitated buying this Blu Ray version of this movie as I had purchased the 2-DVD collector's edition only a few years ago for $10 at the local Target. Fortunately, amazon discounted this BD to a ridiculously low price, so I jumped.<br /><br />The picture quality on this disc is outstanding. Though I ordered this BD in February, I didn't get around to watching it until Saturday (5/26/12) as part of my annual Memorial Day line-up of movie classics. I have to say it was a great experience, particularly the sound, which I fed through my surround set-up. It's amazing how much better the musical soundtrack comes off when it's liberated from sharing space with dialogue and sound effects when listening only through one's built-in TV speakers.<br /><br />Yesterday (5/27/12), the film was played on TCM as part of their Memorial Day line-up, so I watched it again, which afforded me the opportunity to do a pretty good A-B comparison. It was obvious to me that they were not using the BD version as their source for their b'cast, and the differences were stark. Overall, there was no comparison - get the Blu ray version of this film if you want to see it in all its glory. Specifically, though, the older version had a better placement of the subtitles for the Japanese dialogue. The BD version has them placed as two sentences, with one sentence imposed over the picture and one sentence sitting below the frame. The sentence that is on the picture can be very difficult to read, which is funny, as the older version has the subtitles superimposed entirely over the picture, and there is no problem reading them whatsoever.<br /><br />BTW - there's a scene right before the start of the attack where the crew of a ship raises the flag. One of the sailors rings a bell 4 times before the ceremony starts. When the actor portraying the sailor finishes the bell ringing, he takes a few steps backward and trips over the deck, nearly falling on his butt. For as expensive as this film was to produce, I'm surprised they didn't reshoot that scene.ilor finishes the bell ringing, he takes a few steps backward and trips over the deck, nearly falling on his butt.

B0086700CM|5.0|it's great it finally see this game on Kindle Fire!<br />I first played this on my iPhone then put it on my old ipod touch it did seem to be laggier on the ipod. it was disappointing not to have it readily available on Kindle but I found a way to get it on it was a little laggy. this version doesn't seem any worse.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was definitly an attention getter from the start and kept it throughout.  Mr. Baldacci is the best in his government agency mysteries.  I'm an older woman and I enjoy reading his books.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I found the book very thought provoking and kept me turning the pages to read on. I have enjoyed all books so far written by Jodi Picoult. Each one makes you sit back and think about what you may or may not of done in these circumstances.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I was looking for an alarm clock app so I could wake up at a certain time each morning. After trying many other apps like Bedside Clock and Night Clock or whatever, I stumbled across this one, and I love it. It actually works and had some nice features.<br /><br />&bull;You can play your own music as your alarm<br />&bull;You can change the background color<br />&bull;The free version seems to have all the features, just with ads.<br /><br />It is a good clock and you can even set the volume of the alarm so it doesn't wake up other members of your family. So get it. Its free AND it works!

B0053VKP8S|4.0|Works great on the digital output from my TV (TV set to output as PCM). I leave my amplified speakers on all the time, so I can just turn on the TV and not mess around with other remotes or a universal remote, but the D3 causes popping sounds when the TV turns on and off. Its only defect, otherwise works great, and worth the money. Can live with the pops.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|the title says it all. be careful with fights that have a lot going on, the game tends to freeze. not bad for free, would never pay for game.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I removed this app from my phone and my Kindle Fire.  I found the stock email app to be much easier to use.  You would think Yahoo would come up with something much more appealing and easier to you than this.  I was very disappointed in the interface and the capabilities.

B0015DROBO|4.0|Mikael Blomkvist is a 42-year old financial journalist recently accused of libel and facing three months in prison and some pretty hefty fines.  After his trial, Mikael is approached by retired industrialist Henrik Vanger with an offer to write the Vanger family history and do a little extra research into the 1966 disappearance of his great niece Harriet.  Henrik has been obsessed with Harriet's disappearance for the last 36 years and is convinced that someone in the family is behind her murder, despite the fact that the previous investigation has turned up no evidence to support that theory.  In exchange, Henrik offers to hand over some dirt on Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m, the financier which Mikael is attempting to expose.<br /><br />With help from some unlikely sources, including 24-year-old Lisbeth Salander, a genius hacker with Asperger's and a large assortment of tattoos and body piercings, they uncover some seriously sick stuff that someone will go out of their way to keep hidden.  And which puts Mikael right in the line of fire.<br /><br />Though it starts off a bit slow, this book picked up speed about halfway through and got so that I couldn't put it down.  I have to say this was definitely a multi-layered story with a lot going on and some serious undertones.  For example, Lisbeth Salander looks and acts like some kind of anti-social street punk but she's actually extremely intelligent, has a near photographic memory, and is simply a product of all the horrible events she's been through.  She's pretty much had to raise herself and up until recently, nobody has really taken the time or interest to help her acclimate.  There's also the whole issue about violence against women which comes up several times in the course of the story, and again, the way Lisbeth deals with it, I'd say she's anything but a victim.<br /><br />Because this was translated from the original Swedish text, there were a couple things here and there that bugged me a little.  The author's habit of referring to characters by their last name instead of their first was one.  Perhaps it's a European thing but I just couldn't wrap my head around a woman called Berger, or a young girl called Salander. (Which I kept wanting to read as Salamander. LOL)  Also, some of the descriptions, especially pertaining to computer stuff, could be a bit tedious:<br /><br />\\"He used the NotePad programme ([...] one of those full-value products that two men at the Royal Technical College had created and distributed as shareware for a pittance on the Internet.\\"  Or,<br /><br />\\"The rucksack contained her white Apple iBook 600 with 25-gig hard drive and 420 megs of RAM, manufactured in January 2002 and equipped with a 14-inch screen.\\"<br /><br />The above are just a couple of examples where the added details had absolutely no bearing on the rest of the story and seemed a bit out of place.  I assume this was the way it came through in the translation, but I'm surprised all that superfluous detail wasn't edited out.<br /><br />Those minor points aside, I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next book in the Millennium trilogy, The Girl Who Played With Fire, very soon.it of referring to characters by their last name instead of their first was one.

B000FC13Y0|5.0|Stardust is exquisite; a quick and easy fantasy for when you want to escape for a few hours. If you've seen the film, don't expect everything to be exactly the same: the differences in the film and the book don't detract from the other in any way, but both stories are solid on their own. One of my absolute favorite books!
B004VUP8WK|1.0|The first time I heard \\"Blessed Are the Sick\\" I never made it past Fall From Grace because I kept listening to it over and over again. I'd never heard musicality like that in a death metal band. Not only was it technically proficient, but the vocabulary the musicians used to compose their songs was broad and deep.<br />  And now we've come to this...Illud? Everything that made Morbid Angel so great was tossed out the window. With this They gave us skeletons that showed the form of what the once did, but the strength is gone. All because Trey and David Vincent \\"forged their own path\\" by their \\"selfish desire\\" (quote from Fall From Grace) right into the mall.<br />  Forge your satanic path. Fine. But don't expect me to go along with it. The problem with the path they've chosen for the past twenty-eight years is that it's completely dependent on their fans. They won't get far on their path with music like this, at least not with my support. Have fun.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I dove into Hunger Games with great anticipation.  I was soon expecting the heroine, an expert bow hunter with advanced field-craft skills, to go on the offensive against her adversaries.  My enchantment gradually shifted from excitement to disappointment as she remained passive, only reacting to immediate threats in basic ways.  The story eventually petered out into a romance novel - left hanging.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|This will not be a long review like some.  This game is really fun if you like puzzle games.  It reminds me of a sudoku type game.  The only thing missing is a hint button, because sometimes you just don't know where to start.
B006X415GK|4.0|My daughter loves the monster High Dolls. I don't mind buying them but, have had to buy a lot of doubles. The hands, arms and legs seem to be overly delicate. My daughter has not had a single Barbie Doll, Bratz Doll, or Liv Doll that has ever broken and Monster High we have trouble keeping them together. Her friends love coming over and they play for hours with those dolls. In my opinion, the dolls are worth the retail price but I wouldn't pay some of the outrageous prices being charged unless, you are not letting your child take them out of the boxes.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|When I bought the game I expected just a space themed background change, but its a lot more than that.<br /><br />  I enjoyed the physics in the game, but there could be room for improvement. There are very few bugs in the game, but the price is high, especially considering that the game is still unfinished. However, the price would be fine with a few more worlds added.<br /><br />  Over all, the game was great yet incomplete. I found the game a great way to spend a car ride.
B0081J95TE|5.0|After seven years, they are back. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical before I listened just because they hadn't put anything out in such a long time, but they don't disappoint with 'Not Your Kind of People.' It's of the same quality of their other four albums--just awesome. I love these guys.
B001JNNE64|5.0|This is just absolutely great. Grand film, great set, awesome packaging, worth the price. I really love the quality and the content.
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather is a comprehensive and very good app for Android. It is not my only weather app as ABC3340 is my local weather app with local warnings.
B005HSL626|1.0|I never had a chance to play, the pop-up ads froze the game.  I wanted to try the free version to see if I liked the game before I bought the full version. Free Fruit FAIL!
0812981448|5.0|In the last 6-8 months I have read a lot of books on entrepreneurs who started small and then through all kinds of help, support, hard work and with some timely luck made it big. I had enjoyed reading Akio Morita's story of how Sony started and how through Sony, he paved ways for international business in Japan, which prior to Sony, was averse of doing any international business. I had read about how Michael Dell started with Dell computers from his college dorm room and then turned it into a multinational that it is now. I have read more than a few books on how Steve Jobs turned an idea into a big revolution that it is today from his home garage. All these entrepreneurs and more that I had read about had profits at the core of their business. Nothing wrong with it, after all that is what business is mainly about. Never though, had I heard of the concept of mixing a for-profit business with Charity until I read \\"Start Something that matters\\" by Blake Mycoskie.<br /><br />Blake Mycoskie was a born entrepreneur, at the age of 29; he had already started three different businesses and was quite content with where he was. At this stage, he decided to take a vacation and so he went to Argentina. While there, he saw these amazing local Argentine shoes called \\"alpargeta\\". They were worn by practically everyone out there and the entrepreneur in him saw a potential market for those shoes back in USA.  He parked the idea at the back of his mind and continued with his vacation. While visiting some villages, he came across kids who were living their lives with no shoes at all to wear. He researched and found about all the dreadful infections they were subjected to because of the lack of shoes. Then and there, Blake decided he wanted to do something about it and that is when he came up with the idea to start \\"TOMS\\" (....). TOMS refers to \\"Shoes for tomorrow\\". The idea Blake came up with was very simple. His company would start selling \\"alpargeta\\" shoes. For every shoe sold today,TOMS would donate a pair of shoes to kids in need tomorrow. The idea was noble but at the same time very scary as mixing money and charity was not something that was done much in USA. Blake however wanted to pursue this dream and so he did.<br /><br />His journey was tough but in a period of \\"5\\" years after TOMS started, Blake was able to donate One Million shoes to kids in need. Blake goes all out in this book to explain and illustrate so many other such organizations who have taken to do something about the social issues around us. He goes on to explain how one can start with an idea no matter how small it is and then build on it over time and at the same time incorporate \\"giving\\" in their business strategy from the very beginning. He has given references to several tools and techniques in this book to run your start-ups in the least possible financial situation while ensuring that you are giving back to the society.<br /><br />Personally to me, this was a big eye opener. I was stirred emotionally on more than a few occasions while reading the book as Blake narrated several of his interactions with the kids he saw. We take a lot of things we have for granted and never think about those unlucky few, who don't have their basic needs met. I am personally pledging to ensure that I incorporate \\"Giving\\" into my actions. I hope more readers take up to this book and follow the same path.<br /><br />P.S:  For every copy of this book sold, a book is donated to a child, so please get one!!
B007JM4CWY|3.0|Not all the puzzles at solvable.  the math just doesn't add up.at first I thought I might be crazy then I saw other reviewers had the same problem .  and why are all the reviews 5 stars when they are talking about problems? Weird.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I bought this headset expecting an upgrade from my old X12's. And they were amazing. Great game sound, Bass boost was an amazing addition. I had them for at least 3 months until I had experienced a problem. My speakers in the headphones cut out. The sound was totally cut because the cables under the rubber protection have been messed up. I have kept these in good care. I never threw them or let an animal get at them. So I got a new pair sent to me with my warranty. Now 5 months later the same problem has occurred.  So if you want a good sound, but cheap build I would get these.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent novel.Couldn't put it down. I read it in early morning hours and during the day since I had to know what would happen next.After getting halfway through Book 1, I bought the other two books. Reading it a second time around was just as good as the first time reading it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Page turner!!!  Couldn't put this down! A love story that you cannot help but to root for a happy ending!  Equally as good as the first book and left me eager to read the third!
B0086700CM|5.0|yo this game is sick so make sure that everybody gets it it is the #1 game on my iphone
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had to read this book with all the hype in the media about it!  I am NOT a reader, or lets just say, I wasn't until this book.  I read the entire book in less than 2 days and finished the trilogy in 2wks while working full time and taking care of kids.  If you are considering reading this book, then do it.  I recommend it 100%. I loved this, the 2nd, and the 3rd.  Amazing love story with erotic love scenes.  Beautifully written and easy to read.  Loved it!
B0086700CM|4.0|it's a good game to play and it wastes time. But all you do is run and it gets boring over time. I got this game cause it was free.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great way to finish the trilogy!  This love story ending exactly as you would hope that it would!  My only regret is that there is not a fourth book!  Loved it!
0802136834|5.0|The Six Wives of Henry VIII / 9780802136831<br /><br />I am really starting to enjoy Alison Weir's Tudor history -- I enjoyed \\"Mary Boleyn\\" and I loved \\"The Lady in the Tower\\", particularly the audio book version of the same. I picked up \\"The Children of Henry VIII\\", only to see in the foreword that the book continues on from THIS book, \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\", so I put down \\"Children\\" and bought a copy of \\"Wives\\".<br /><br />And, really, this book is lovely. All the history you love to hear from Weir, all the careful sourcing and citing of who is biased and how and in what time period they were writing, and all combined in a really stream-lined, efficient narrative. There's a wealth of valuable information here and it's a joy to read; I'm really sorry there doesn't seem to be an audio book version of this because I think it would be delightful to listen to.<br /><br />I especially enjoy that this book really is about the wives and not about Henry. There's some introductory stuff about Henry woven deeply into the opening chapters about Katherine of Aragon, but once that's out of the way the focus returns closely to the wives. The historical narrative deals with the women chronologically (which flows nicely since there isn't too much overlap between the wives), and once Henry dies, Weir continues the stories of Katherine Parr and Anne of Cleves to their final conclusions. Everything about this portion of the narrative is superbly written and easy to follow.<br /><br />If I have a gentle criticism of this book, it is that much of the section on Anne and Mary Boleyn is later contradicted by Weir in her more recent books, \\"Mary Boleyn\\" and \\"The Lady in the Tower\\". There's nothing wrong with that -- I'm pleased that Weir is the kind of historian who is willing to refine her statements in the face of new evidence -- but I wanted to make a note of it for readers. If you're going to read this book (and I highly recommend it!), I suggest pairing it with \\"The Lady in the Tower\\" for a more complete look at the life of Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardolle Tower\\" for a more complete look at the life of Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very very addicting! It is probally one of the best games now on androids and kindle fires!!!! So keep on purchasing this game!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I first saw this album for $5. While it was fairly cheap, I passed even though I liked the sound of OMAM, but I just bought it recently for $2.99. My verdict? I should have bought it the first time and I would have paid full price for this album. It is simple, yet so amazing and consuming with. I find myself addicted to \\"Little talks\\" and but I'm also crazy about \\"Mountain Sound\\". The first half of the album in itself is worth a regularly priced CD.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I run a daycare and the app is great for my older kids,  who sometimes struggle with how to pass the time. There's plenty of variety to choose from. The points are easy to accumulate, which making unlocked the other games pretty simple. There's something for everyone. Some of the controls are a little off, making it difficult to play some games.
0345803507|5.0|I love this series.  I am usually not a reader but really enjoyed all of these books.  I hope the author comes out with more very soon.

1451683405|1.0|It seems like Sam Harris is trying realy realy hard to make an issue out of something that just isn't there.
0345803485|1.0|This had to be without a doubt the worst book(s) I have ever been stupid enough to buy, and waste time reading.  Like everyone else I was drawn in by the hype this book was getting.  It really did sound like a 15 year old wrote it and when at a loss for words repeated the same stupid phrases over and over and over again, ad nauseaum.  I will remember this author's name and will NEVER buy another thing she writes ever again.  Wish I could get my money back!
0545101425|5.0|My son is dyslexic so reading is a chore. It was wonderful for him to enjoy the series with out it being a chore. He is 14 and he loved all of the books on tape.
0547258305|5.0|It was full of action! I loved the characters! I loved the love story! Katsa is a very strong protagonist and the story was great.  Po is great too. I love him too! Definitely my favorite out of the trilogy.

B0086700CM|5.0|Very fun and addicting game. Runs very well on the Kindle Fire. You must download it! Definitely the best game on the app store.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant tell you how thrilled I am that Temple Run is finally availible for Kindle Fire!!!! I waited for practically ages for this moment!!!! thank you!
B006TGWY3K|3.0|Listenable & enjoybable enough but no real stand-out songs, even with the LC's standard remake of an old classic.  Vocals are heavier on the male side than I'd like to hear from LC.
B0086700CM|5.0|Thank you amazon for getting an app that all apple users love and now kindle users love! This is one of the few apps that is not cheap and glitchy! :D

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have had this case for about 3 months now and it is awesome. It protects it from shock (I drop my phone quite a bit) and it is easy to slip in and out of your pocket. It is stylish and all around a great case!
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever. because when ever you play this game theyy feel like they are really doing it for example when your in the woods you fell like you are playing this game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and addicting. I just love trying to catch scratch.you earn a lot of coins to keep the game moving unlike other tap games.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Yes, the music has changed, but I didn't know what was used in the original series anyway, I was 5 when Daria premiered and I wasn't watching MTV, I was watching nickelodeon, so there is no problem. If the music is really a big issue, then look up every tracklisting for every episode and edit it yourself for your own enjoyment. There is not a big problem for me: I have all the episodes now without the hassle of watching them online using my cursed Wi-Fi connection. End.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A very poorly done reprisal of Wuthering Heights with sex scenes.  This is an utterly unrealistic fantasy for those into male domination.  Further, there is no character development and the only portions of the book that reflect real effort in terms of the writing are the sex scenes.
B0042816YK|4.0|I thought this film adaptation was much better than the book, which was filled with self-actualization jargon. True, the narrator here does lapse into quoting lines from the book from time to time, but it's limited. There are many emotional moments here about finding yourself, looking for love, healing and searching for answers about life that everyone goes through. The scenery is beautiful in all locations, Italy, India and Bali. The acting leads are all pretty good. If you pictured these people when reading the book, the  faces chosen for the movie won't disappoint. This is one of the better new films I have seen.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Its like sudoku meets a crosswotd puzzle.  Its a little difficult to figure out at first but once you get the hang of it its great!
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|Withdrawal from the world is not a quality worthy of admiration. There is nothing compelling about this film. The story it tells is not admirable in my humble opinion.<br />If you want a movie with a moral, watch something else. If you want a movie with a compelling narrative, watch something else. If you want a movie with a character who places his own profundity over the lives of others, then watch this movie.
0345803485|2.0|While I was reading this novel, I couldn't help but think that it reminded me of Twilight. Here you have a shy, virginal, clumsy brunette main character named Anastassia Steele and she falls for the domineering, controlling, sophisticated Christan Gray. They reminded me of Bella and Edward...come to find out, this book was originally a Twilight fanfiction. Too funny, but I digress. I think this novel had the potential to be great, but it fell flat. Some people have pointed this out already but I couldn't stand the repetitiveness of it. Ana biting her lip, her saying \\"oh please\\" when she had sex with Christan, him wearing clothes that were gray (eyeroll), etc. The list goes on and on. I got bored of the sex scenes too. There was one thing that Christian did that disturbed me the most and surprisingly it has nothing to do with him inflicting pain on Ana...<br /><br />*WARNING SPOILER*<br /><br />...what disturbed me was him sniffing her underwear...Um, EW?! If a guy ever did that to me, I would run away and never look back. But anyways, I would only recommend this book to those who want to read erotica involving BDSM but want to start off with something that isn't too much for them.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|copied from my blog, since amazon won't just let me post a link:<br /><br />Because I care so very much about the value (or lack thereof) of literature, I am going to spare you the wasted $9.99 I spent on 50 Shades of Grey and give you the EZ Cliffs Notes version. This will help you sail through any possible middle school assignment you or your child might have on this piece of tripe book without ever having to endure actually read it. Here, for your reading pleasure, is all of 50 Shades of Grey, in 600 words or less.<br />.<br />Ahem<br />.<br />There I sat in Grey's lobby, all frizzy haired, lip biting and otherwise not requiring description, pondering my impending graduation. It was so hot and it made me feel all hot down there. Suddenly in he walked. Oh my. He's so freaking hot. I bite my lip. With his red hair and the same pair of grey flannel pants he wears every time I see him, despite being a billionaire who could afford to change occasionally. As usual he's all wet hair and bare chest with those same grey flannel pants hanging off his hips that way that everyone seems to love, but I won't describe, not even the first time. I think I might convulse as he whips out a condom and tears it open.<br /><br />I smile a Cheshire cat grin. He touches my hand and electricity flows between us like it does every. single. f-ing. (staccato.) time we meet, because he's smiling a Cheshire cat grin. I bite my lip. My subconscious is snoring. My inner goddess is masturbating. I cannot help wondering, as I convulse...does he really like me? Does he care for me? He's talking to me, but all I can think about, all awkward and poorly dressed and clumsy, is whether he might like me and how all confused, horny and unhappy I am.<br /><br />Oh, no. His mood has changed again, all hot and mercurial and still wearing those flannel pants that hang on his hips that indescribable way I like. He's so mercurial. Now he's smiling. Why is he so mercurial? Oh, he's grim again. It makes me convulse. We've only just met yesterday, but he's leading me to his Red Room of Pain. Oh my, he's smiling at me. I'm so happy. He flicks me with a whip. I come. Wait, why does he look so grim? I'm scared. Did I do something wrong? Will he spank me again? I don't know what I want. Do I sign his S&M contract, or just beg him to love me and give me vanilla sex on his desk?<br /><br />As much as I was a virgin yesterday, I am still intrigued by the whips, chains, ben wa balls, shackles, leather gag balls, and carabineers. I've never seen a room like this. I bite my lip. It's freaking hot. I convulse. Down there. What are all these contraptions for? My friend Kate, all gamine, freshly-f-ed hair and loose morals, would never understand my fascination with this complicated man-freak.<br /><br />Wait, did he say something? \\"Stop biting your lip.\\" I wish I could understand him, he's so mercurial. He must love me. I bite my lip. I roll my eyes. Aargh! Why else would he invite me within a week of meeting me to be his submissive sex slave? Gah! \\"Yes, Sir.\\" I bite my lip.<br /><br />My subconscious slaps me upside the head. My inner goddess is happy, all having her anus bleached and singing an aria. He's everything I've ever known to avoid in a man. He's a stalker and possessive and can only have sex if it's extra nasty. It's hot. Down there. But why can't we just do it missionary again? I convulse.<br /><br />Despite my normal upbringing, all Beaver Cleaveresque...he's exactly what I want and need. I bite my lip.<br /><br />When we break up I cry, all snotty and broken hearted, because he's so ideal and I do so not deserve to be his submissive sex slave. Thinking about it makes me convulse. Why, oh my, why, oh why could our ideal romance not work out? I bite my lip.<br />...<br />Sophomoric Drekitude. Horrible horrible...heinous terrible awful writing. I want my $9.99 and my Saturday back. I've been around the block, honey, and like a good hair-pulling spanking here and there, fine... But who wants to read hundreds of pages about a girl with zero personality, being stupid? This is like some self absorbed 17 year old C- student decided to write soft core porn, and get daddy to publish it for her despite thousands of far more talented writers not even being considered by agents.<br /><br />I want to be her subconscious...meet her in starbucks and slap her stupid lip-biting face and make her convulse. HOW this author managed to get this tripe published is so far beyond me..ugh. Terrible.<br /><br />It's like listening to your least favorite girlfriend whine for 12 hours straight about loving her cheating boyfriend while you're tied to a chair and forced to nod, smile and tell her she's soooo pretty and he's prolly just confused and scared and obviously his desire for a goat to join their love play means he really wants her.<br /><br />I hear it's been optioned as a movie. I pity the actors.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This book is essential reading to writers who are just now coming to terms with the world of publishing in the 21st century.  Many writers are still skeptical about taking the digital plunge and self-publishing, and they shouldn't be.<br /><br />Gone are the days of rejection letters and manuscripts gathering dust.  If you're serious about getting your work published, and it's good work, rest assured, there's an audience for it.  You've got the tools you need at your fingertips, and David Gaughran has put together one of the best resources on self-publishing in the digital era that I've run across.<br /><br />Mr. Gaughran provides a wealth of information to get you started down the path of being published.  You can do it, there's not much holding you back.<br /><br />You'll find lots of solid advice here, about the importance of editing (this can't be stressed enough), artwork, social media, pricing, and marketing.  This is a very straight forward book aimed at helping writers achieve their goals of getting published.<br /><br />The section telling the success stories of other writers who pursued self-publishing is very inspiring and insightful.  There are also plenty of resources throughout this well written book, though I'd encourage you to follow Mr. Gaughran's blog, do your own research, and compile your own resources too.<br /><br />On a side note, it's stunning to read about the number of books that get pulped each year, and sad, but not surprising to read about the barriers being erected trying to stop the coming tsunami of ebooks, and self-publishing (especially in Europe).<br /><br />If you're reading this review, you've probably been toying with the idea of epublishing.  If you have, and this is all new to you, you'll find that this book is an invaluable resource.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought this for a slightly more unusual use -- as an external \\"soundcard\\" essentially.  I use the digital outputs from my computers (optical from one, coaxial from the other so I can just switch between them with the flip of a switch) to use this as an external DAC.  From here it connects to my headphone amp (a CMoy with an AD8620 -- a simply amazing sounding DAC even if it's a tad power hungry that makes it sound far better than a CMoy) directly.  As a DAC it just sounds absolutely amazing.  It has better clarity and quality than any I've used up to now, including some external \\"soundcard\\" type DACs like the Alien DAC.  There is a bit more of a noise floor than some of them, but I still have to turn the volume dial up so far that if it were playing music I'd be bursting my eardrums to really notice it.  This gives me all of the benefits of an \\"external DAC\\" with more universal compatibility (since it works with far more than just my computers) and a surprisingly amazing sound.  Far better than I ever expected really.  I've even ordered a USB soundcard for my netbook which has an optical output and which matches the D3's frequency and depth range (so I can use 96/24 if I so choose) because I like this so much I want it on there.  I'm going to have to get another of these as a backup I think.  I don't ever want to go back, even if this thing tears up...<br /><br />I have tested this with my TVs too out of curiosity.  The first thing that I noticed is that my TVs do not have the option to decode the audio.  They just do a straight digital passthrough.  One reviewer said it doesn't work with over-the-air, but this is just because so many use encoding methods (probably DTS I guess.)  It definitely does work with anything that supports using a PCM output and with TVs like these any device that uses PCM on their digital interface will just be passed through still as PCM.  For instance, my Roku player uses an HDMI cable and is set to stereo output.  The TV just passes it directly and the Roku at least sounds great when connected to the Fiio D3.  I've also tested using the optical output of my PS2 console and so far haven't found anything where it didn't just work great.  I tried to find games with good music and I've discovered that a few (most notably PSX ports like the Megaman X collection) don't really sound great, but a few are just wonderful this way (just for instance, the Persona games.)  The game Rez never suited me that well, but I believe that people who love it should absolutely try it this way.<br /><br />Fiio does not recommend using the OPAMP to directly drive headphones.  As a preamp it sounds fine, but it would probably be a bit weak for things like headphones.  I haven't really tested that since it definitely couldn't compete with my CMoy and the OPAMP on it.  I have heard of people replacing the TI LMV358 OPAMP on there with others such as the Analog Devices AD8656 with positive results (though you obviously have to be very good with a soldering iron for this and can, of course, count on utterly voiding the warranty in doing so.)  The AD8656 at least can drive headphones directly, so with a proper setup this could even act as a headphone amp in addition to acting as a DAC.  I probably won't be doing this any time soon, but if the AD8656 sounds even remotely like the AD8620 I might consider it someday (in the meantime I obviously can't review what it might sound like.)directly and the Roku at least sounds great when connected to the Fiio D3.

B0086700CM|4.0|Truley this game is very good. A work of art if you ask me. However there are problems specifically with controls. The problem is that demanding him to do something speciffic usually leads to him doing something else so; slurring sideways makes him jump down makes him jump and up makes him slide.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg now all we need is doodle jump and this would be even better yes  its finnaly here this is gonna be great ..............
B0086700CM|5.0|Okay. so my forensic and I was pretty mad because when we first got the kindle fire, temple run wasn't on it. We had it on the ipad/ipod bland loved this game. The amazon app store doesn't hold many games, or at least good games as the apple app store. Fora soccer isn't in the amazon store.... but it is on the apple app store, so I hope that soon the amazon app store will have all he apps that apple has.

B0067TGSOK|5.0|I've been a fan of Chris Guillebeau's work for nearly as long as he's been putting it out there, and this book is no exception. The difference here is that he's moving beyond the inspiration of his AONC blog and his earlier book to give a wide audience the practical benefits of his very successful (and much more expensive) Empire Building Kit.<br /><br />Starting a microbusiness, a web business, or other such endeavor? This book is a simple and accessible 'how-to' for a successful launch and then building on that solid foundation. There are practical steps and checklists to help you narrow down your great ideas to the one you can sell, get your project up and out into the world, and loads of inspiration from others like Guillebeau who have gone down this path and never looked back! I'm launching my second business project this summer, and I thank the universe I have this book to guide me.

B007JWKLP6|4.0|None other than Martin Scorsese pulls together tons of video clips, home movies, still photos, print clippings and interesting interviews to explore the life of the \\"quiet\\" Beatle.  The 2 disc Blu ray set runs nearly 3 ½ hours (not including supplements) divided into 2 parts.  There is another 20 minutes or so of bonus features.<br /><br />Part I details Harrison's early days with the Beatles.  This section is as much about the Beatles and their emergence as it is about George.  We can see that John and Paul essentially run the group, write almost all the songs leaving George and Ringo only occasional input.  All the while George is collecting numerous songs he'd written but never made it on a record, at least until the last Beatle albums.  By then he had had enough.  For him the break-up was a good thing.<br /><br />Part 2 deals with Harrison's talents becoming mainstream with a cadre of great songs, many of which were attributed to The Beatles.  We see his first marriage fail when Pattie Boyd leaves for best friend Eric Clapton, although there isn't anything too juicy explained by any of the participants.  We see how Harrison became heavily influenced by Ravi Shankar and meditation.  Even the eventual love of his life, Olivia admits George continued to have affairs after their marriage, but Scorsese keeps a respectful distance.<br /><br />The best part of the film is the great interviews with those that loved Harrison.  In addition to the obvious choices, we hear from race car driver Jackie Stewart, record impresario Phil Spector, actress Jane Birkin, actor/comedian Eric Idle and director Terry Gilliam along with some of the great musicians Harrison played with.  The documentary is long, too long, but is very revealing as to the musical genius that was George Harrison.

B0041VV03A|1.0|Two scientists in a long-term relationship create a human/animal clone.  What starts out as a suspenseful sci-fi horror flick, quickly devolves into a high strung drama about two dysfunctional, unlikeable characters and their ridiculous mutant.<br /><br />The CGI is very poor and the characters never develop any redeeming qualities.  The behavior is just unbelieveable, and I must admit it became so silly, I laughed at some scenes.<br /><br />This movie fails on so many levels, you have to wonder why anyone would sign on to this after reading the script.  Academy Award Winner Adrien Brody needs to fire his agent and the female lead needs a better makeup artist. Splice is not easy on the eyes.<br /><br />This movie was rough.  An alien sex scene and a brutal rape later, you're left wondering what else the writers will throw at you.  This is not a movie for children, the faint of heart, or anyone who wants to preserve their sense of innocence. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I can honestly say, I had NO IDEA what I was getting myself into when I clicked \\"Rent\\"--and no matter what I tell you, I can bet with a great amount of certainty, neither will you.

B007K3JCAE|1.0|I love the film and would gladly give it four or five stars, but I will not buy any Blu-Ray with that option, and I refuse to give the packaged product an acceptable rating. I have been ripped off at least four times with this new marketing scheme. In the beginning, they promised something you could add to your computer, but that was an ambiguous promise at best, because they never came close to doing just that.<br /><br /> I want a compatible digital copy that works through I-Tunes on my computer at home. If a glitch happens, then I want to be able to access the copy rather than find out the thing no longer works because of some kind of expiration date. The other option is a ripoff. If consumers would stop buying this option, it will vanish. I will be buying it through I-Tunes.<br /><br />I refuse to go through the frustration of dealing with Ultra-Violet a fifth time for nothing but added disgust for the people marketing this thing.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I decided to give this film a chance, since Liam Neeson does tortured hero very well. What I didn't realize was that this movie would be so very depressing. I was feeling down the rest of the day and if I ever entertained thoughts of visiting Alaska before, I certainly won't in the future! If you like movies primarily for the atmosphere and mood they create, this will be satisfying for you. But if you like cohesive plots and stories that drive to some type of climax, don't waste your money or your time on this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I always played on my brothers opossum because it NEVER had it on my lg optimus phone!! I wouldn't let me play it anymore cause I always wasted his battery! yesterday I was bored and went to find new games in top free games on my kindle! then this is what I saw 1 temple run . I was soooooo happy! I quickly checked on my phone and sadly it wasn't there! :( when it finished downloading I played like 24/7 I only stopped to check on my pet cafe. its a game ! of course woo.er or later I had to stop! it lags a lil bit but other than that awesome! :)
B005LAIGLE|5.0|If you're a Mark Wahlberg fan, read no further--you're going to love this movie. I prefer comedy and historical dramas, so I had to be cajoled into seeing this movie with my fiance. But 30 minutes into it I was hooked. Although the general plot line isn't original, there were some interesting subplots and twists throughout. The main characters are fleshed out and realistic, not cardboard cutouts of your friendly neighborhood racketeering ring. The dialogue was succinct and there were some funny moments too. Add  in a couple of fight scenes, a shootout and a heist and you've got yourself a great movie. Definitely worth owning on DVD.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing this but had no idea how much I would LOVE this movie. It has some moments reminiscent of Ocean's 11; you can tell that this film was lovingly crafted when it came to the soundtrack, scenery, editing, and all the other little things that take a movie from good to excellent. The story was compelling and very clever. It's a smart movie. You have to do a little work to put the pieces together, but it's worth it and makes it that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />What I loved most is that the actress who plays Mallory, the protagonist, looks like a REAL secret agent would look--muscular curves, practical clothes, minimal makeup. There's a great scene of her relaxing while cleaning her gun and drinking a glass of wine with her hair tied up in a scarf. That's me every night (sub out the gun for a book though, lol)! Moreover, Mallory gets the job done without heavy reliance on her sex appeal although she definitely has it. When she gets down to business she's kicking butt in boots, not running around flailing wildly on five inch heels. The supporting cast is great as well, and it's wonderful to see a movie where men regard the female character as their equal (or better) without trying to put her in her place.<br /><br />Gina Carano more than holds her place among more seasoned actors. She really lights up the screen and I hope to see her in more films.
1401235417|4.0|The book starts with the inmates of Arkham Asylum being set loose and I groaned, thinking Scott Snyder had fallen into using the template Batman story of the Dark Knight playing roundup with the villains but thankfully Snyder disposes of this tired trope quickly, almost as if he were winking \\"just kidding\\" before starting on something better. Bruce Wayne is threatened by an assassin called the Talon, a seemingly indestructible villain, used as hired muscle by a shadowy organisation called the Court of Owls, kind of like Ra's Al-Ghul's League of Shadows but creepier as they all wear blank owl-shaped masks.<br /><br />The book is similar to \\"The Gates of Gotham\\" where the history and architecture of Gotham plays a big part of the story, with more background info on the Wayne family history and the history of Gotham. I like that Snyder is building up Gotham as a substantial character in itself as it is a fascinating place that's always shrugged off by most writers as just a background element. Snyder plays on the gothic features of the city and the centuries it's been around, crafting a story deep in mystery.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure how this book is placed within the current Batman story arc with Grant Morrison; it seems that Batman Inc. is up and running but I thought Dick Grayson had left the Nightwing persona behind and was now Batman full time, alongside Bruce et al. so it was surprising to see Nightwing back in this book. Maybe he moonlights as both?<br /><br />There's an excellent Morrison-esque trippy sequence where Batman is trapped in a labyrinth beneath Gotham where nightmares become reality and the shadows offer no respite. I thought Greg Capullo's layouts in this section were especially inventive and well put-together to give the feeling of unease and dread that Batman was going through. I especially liked the single crazed eye of Bruce Wayne as he went through this sequence, very \\"Telltale-Heart\\". Capullo's artwork throughout is great, though I thought his design of the Talon was a bit similar to the main character of the \\"Assassin's Creed\\" video games.<br /><br />Scott Snyder continues to write interesting, thoughtful, and gripping Batman books and the only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that there is much left unrevealed at the end (though it is a tantalising finale), but this is \\"Volume 1\\" so there is more to come. Snyder has begun an excellent series and any Bat-fans will find plenty to enjoy with this book. Can't wait for volume two-oo (couldn't resist, sorry)!ought his design of the Talon was a bit similar to the main character of the \\"Assassin's Creed\\" video games.<br /><br />Scott Snyder continues to write interesting, thoughtful, and gripping Batman books and the only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that there is much left unrevealed at the end (though it is a tantalising finale), but this is \\"Volume 1\\" so there is more to come.

B00005NTJK|5.0|This is my favorite JT album/cd. I was taken by it immediately and it stands tall among the whole catalog of JT albums/cd's. After \\"Benefit\\" the band seemed to get too commercial for me especially with \\"Aqualung\\" and didn't care for the change in the vocal style Ian Anderson had made. His vocals on \\"Benefit\\" SHINE. JT's album/cd \\"Stand Up\\" should of been put with \\"Benefit\\" as a 2 album set as \\"Benefit\\" sounds like a continuation of \\"Stand Up\\". When I hear \\"Benefit\\" it makes me think of Robin Hood and his Merry men cavorting around in Sherwood Forest. LOL Buy this CD and be happy for the rest of your life. You'll get hooked on it I am sure.

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|First off, I hate vampires in contemporary media. I'm a werewolf fan. The element of tragedy that seeps into such stories grabs me every time. But Bram Stoker's Dracula is done all old school and is one of my favourites, compared to the Bela Lugosi version and perhaps even the Spanish version that was filmed side by side.<br /><br />The film itself has been the topic of discussion and the plot is well-known. It is the only vampire film that deals in the same vein of the original book: much of the opening of the movie is presented by way of letters and journal entries. But what is interesting is the behind the scene treasure trove we are given.<br /><br />I dare say folk watching this version will learn something new from these features or notice new details during the film. One trick I learned was that everything was done 'live' despite the rise of computer graphics, everything was done on camera. The commentary is charming and obvious love of the film is appreciated by the director. The costumes, make up, dramatic readings, all are shared in great details. This is one BD upgrade everyone should make. Not only is the film restored and well-presented in HD, but again, it's the details. Over a dozen languages for the subtitles, commentary subtitles... this BD is a rich experience and genre fans can enjoy what was perhaps the last great turn prior to shiny and emo vampires. Vampires should be monsters. And this is a monster of a BD.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|We enjoyed the movie when it came out and was excited to get the DVD.  When I saw you also received a digital copy, I thought great I can watch it on my portable devices.  Unfortunately, the service you have to use is Sony's Ultraviolet download service.  After installing their downloader and attempting to download the digital copy, I was met with your DRM settings in Silverlight were not correct.  After checking the setting in Silverlight and they were correct, I tried uninstalling the downloader and re-installing it.  Still same error message.  So I contacted Sony's service group who told me to uninstall both Silverlight and their downloader and re-install them.  After doing that and receiving the same error, they suggesting uninstalling both, reboot machine, re-install, reboot, and then it should work.  After doing that and receiving the same error, I sent them a response that it didn't work and I wasn't happy.  So they sent me a reply that basically started the help process all over again.  So after many uninstalls and re-install with many reboots scattered about, I still do not have my digital copy.  Thank you Sony for a useless online experience.
B003Y5H556|4.0|The first breathless moments of this re-imagining of the classic faerie tale throw you into a beautiful vista with haunting music. The sets and costumes are simply amazing, and the doe-eyed Amanda Seyfried is equally enchanting. Not all the actors fit well with these elements, mostly the lead males seem a bit awkward or forced. But it isn't enough to ruin the story. Gary Oldman again demands the viewer's attentions, as he always does, as a monster-slayer known as Father Solomon come to save Valerie's village from the Wolf. And the Red cloak almost seems as a character of its own - one wonders how many times it gets snagged during production...<br /><br />The BD presentation gives us a veritable basket of goodies: an alternate ending, which I prefer over the theatrical; a pic-in-pic commentary (only for the theatrical cut, boo); a gag reel (where everyone except Seyfried gets their costumes to snag on something), additional scenes, two music videos, a very short composite of the Wolf in its various iterations of creation, and an even shorter version of the film - summed up in a mere 73 seconds.<br /><br />There's enough here to mark the making of a truly remarkable film. For some I know, there was disappointment but I think such reviews are a bit more harsh than the film deserves. While not a frightening or creepy movie, it is a good film and a solid retelling of one of the most famous of faeries tales made for a new generation. Do yourself the favour of watching it before you condemn it.

B0043CJ980|1.0|Its highly annoying to purchase a CD...only for them to release different versions depending on where or when you buy it.  I am tired of the 'bonus' tracks that change to try to force you to buy at Target or I-tunes or even Amazon.  Worse I am tired of the 're-issue' to get the popular new song.  What's up with that?  We order the DELUXE EDITION but don't get the most popular song from the album?  Gone are the days when you could just go an buy a CD...now you must evaluate the CD you are going to get from every source.  And much of the time getting the actual CD is no necessarily where you are going to get the bonus track so you need to evaluate the MP3 section here as well as on I-tunes.  And don't forget to evaluate the pre-orders...cause sometimes pre-orders have bonus tracks, although you might miss out on the extra special song they add to the album as they might add songs later.  Ahh and the icing on the cake, is when they add songs and make them album only so if you want them--yep you are going to have to buy the CD again.<br /><br />Seems rather greedy to me.  Not necessarily the artist at fault here--more likely the record company.  But the brunt of the anger lands at the artist's door so maybe you should do something about that...its just not a good way of thanking the people that are out there supporting you.<br /><br />Guess I should be happy that I could pick up 'Moves Like Jagger' as a single...but I am not happy at all.  And for Amazon to still be selling it?  Calling it the Deluxe Edition--that's supposed to be better right?  Yet if you go buy the regular album you actually get MORE than if you buy this.<br /><br />You can bet I won't fall for another Maroon 5 'deluxe edition', like the one that is being touted as a pre-order now...

0316044938|4.0|I have heard a lot about this book, and looked forward to reading it. When I finally got to it, it was a journey that I don't regret taking.<br />In the first part of the story, I was blindsighted by my wish of bringing Harvey to justice, just like Jack was. Then I started to see how every single life, not just the murder victim's, mattered; remembered how life is not a movie that promises a satisfactory ending where everything has a closure. I think this was possible because the author pays good attention to each member of the family and friends. The readers can follow their lives and sympathize with the different ways with which they deal with Susie's death. How Susie deals with her own death as she grows in her heaven. I liked the way the book ended as well, no shiny stuff, just calm and down-to-earth with a bit of humor. I don't think it was anticlimactic at all because the book isn't about catching the killer. It's about family and love and growing up.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars because of Ruth's character and the part with Ruth leaving her body. I didn't understand fully how she became so attached to Susie's death as if she was her best friend in life, or even a crush. I do appreciate the quirky character, though. Everyone is so suburban in the book that without Ruth, things could have been a lot flatter.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun for awhile, but it seems like you need to use REAL money to progress any decent length in the game...which makes it free to DOWNLOAD, but not free to actually PLAY for very long. But hey, if they can get people to buy into that system, more power to them.
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought the amazon appstore would never get temple run and I was so excited when they finally got it. It's about time
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The cover of this book caught my attention at the library and I had to read it. I wanted to know the story of the forlorn looking little girl and why she looked so sad. I wanted to know what this home was and where it was.<br /><br />I expected something like Oliver Twist, where the home was a place of horrors for the children within.<br /><br />What I found was something far better. In a world of 'potato chip' paranormal fiction, where one book is very like another and only the names seem different, this book stands out like a beacon. The characters are amazing; even those that we never really meet except through the words of other characters stand out and hold a place in the story. The plot is well-constructed and I quite literally could not put this book down, reading it straight through from page one to the end. As I finished, I found myself hoping for a sequel. Not finding one available at this time (though it seems that one is waiting in the wings), I briefly mourned and then came to write a review.<br /><br />This book wouldn't be suitable for very young children; there are some elements that are truly terrifying and only too likely to cause nightmares in younger children. However, for any lover of the paranormal and fantasy, this book should not be passed over.<br /><br />Read it. Come meet the peculiar children who live in Miss Peregrine's home. I promise you won't regret it.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I can't believe there are so many negative reviews for this Kindle Fire case. Yes, it's plastic. But it snaps right on to the device very easily, and it's plastic for a reason: it's lightweight. The Kindle Fire has a nice hefty weight to it already, you won't want a big heavy case to add to that. The design is very form fitting, it's not bulky at all. The rubberized coating on the outside makes it very pleasing to hold and touch. The strap is well attached and works to hold the cover back when you're using the Kindle and on when you're not, and the cover supports the weight of the Kindle just fine when you're sitting it up to watch a movie. I love the color, it's much more bold and bright in pink than the picture shows but I love it. I haven't had the case very long but it seems tough to me, the plastic is flexible so it doesn't shatter or crack if you drop it.It's a good buy for the money, I recommend it for any Kindle Fire user.
B0086700CM|5.0|I played this game on my friends ipod and was looking for it for kindle fire and couldn't. But now I have it and love it. I highly reccomend this it helps pass time. Also is very addicting.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I'll admit I did read the Twilight series. But I have always enjoyed vampire fiction and so I picked it up as everyone else was. I hated it. I hadn't read the book series that this show is based on, hadn't even heard of it, but when the show was advertised, I thought no way am I going to watch a show that is just another Twilight. Teen angst in high school dating a vampire, etc etc etc, boring. Just before season 3 was getting ready to start, I noticed the first two seasons were on Netflix instant play. Being extremely bored I gave it a shot and watched the first episode. It was ok. But I was still bored so I kept watching. Next thing I know I'm totally invested in the characters. Not so much the main three, Elena and the Salvatore brothers, but their friends and family. They became interesting and I cared about them in this mess that Elena gets them in to by relating with vampires. Bonnie, Jeremy, and Caroline are all favorites. I was surprised that I cared about characters that initially I couldn't stand. And while the first season is a good starter, the story increasingly gets stronger and darker as the seasons go on. It's bloodier and sexier than Twilight could ever hope to be. If you like vampire fiction, give this show a chance, it is thoroughly enjoyable. It's successful enough that is still on the air, if you aren't yet convinced. Eagerly awaiting season 4!
B004JN1D2I|3.0|The book is great, but I'll never buy another bundle. It downloads as one long book. You can't tell how far into each book you are.

B0073XORCY|3.0|Thank God for YouTube and being able to listen to most of the album.  As a fan of JT since the \\"Benefit\\" album, and one who adores \\"TAAB I\\" and \\"A Passion Play,\\" I am impressed with the album overall.  Anderson's voice on this album is outstanding compared to previous albums in the past decade or so.  And musically, it's Anderson's best composition in 20 years as far as I can discern.  Yes, we wish he'd consulted with John Evan, Martin Barre, Barrie Barlow and even Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, but who knows if he did and they declined?  I've not found evidence either way on the Internet.<br /><br />I just have to think more about whether I listen to this album with any of the joy I still get from the JT era from \\"Stand Up\\" through \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" (Things start to fall a bit with \\"Songs from the Wood\\" which always sounded a bit stiff to me), especially \\"TAAB\\" and the \\"Play.\\"  It is so difficult for an old person who has indelible memories of a past work to hear the new work with new  feelings.<br /><br />I would like to add something apart from the review, and that concerns Anderson's attempts to say TAAB I was a mere parody of progressive rock.  Here, Anderson has ingested the ridiculous criticisms of rock critics of the 1970s (stupid rock critics would be a redundancy) in saying he was parodying progressive rock.  If that was the case, Anderson would not have bothered to create \\"A Passion Play.\\"  In 1971 and 1972, and into 1973, Anderson was deadly serious about what he and band were creating.  Yes, there was whimsy, parody, irony and wit, but the goal was something creative and which was designed to be considered as serious as \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" was for Gershwin.  I also distinctly recall Anderson saying how dumb the rock critics in England were for falling for the stunt of \\"Gerald Bostock\\" at the time the album was being released so if there was a put on, it was against the rock critics of the time.  TAAB I remains a seriously brilliant album from a musicalperspective, and a charming and brilliant one from a lyrical perspective.  TAAB II is a fairly solid album, and has several excellent moments.  I love the parallel universe concepts for Bostock's life that are identified within the album.  Good for Derek Schulman of my beloved Gentle Giant for asking Anderson to create the sequel.

B007LNJ4YW|4.0|Over the course of their musical journey Beach House have developed a their own sweet, joyous wall-of-sound compositions. But with Bloom it seems to have come full circle. And as each track unravels, they do just that, they bloom. The development of each song - start to finish - builds upon itself, beginning with a simple guitar melody and arriving at an ultimately dense, rich and fully realised \\"sound.\\" It is truly a joy to behold. Although Beach House have not strayed too far from the \\"sound\\" of their begginings - and therefore could disengage most people unimpressed by their debut offerings - they have expanded it and refined it to create a more absorbing layered sound that simply blooms.

B003Y5H5F6|3.0|One of the most entertaining things about the first two UNDERWORLD films is that they were actioners through and through. They didn't bother with the \\"reality\\" of the world; They just gave us the situation: There were Vampires who all dressed like they went to a fetish boutique, and there were Werewolves aka Lycans who were living like the animals of their namesake and both of these mythical creatures had been at war for centures. We followed the adventures of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a \\"death-dealer\\" vampire who fell in love with Michael (Scott Speedman), a human who became a hybrid lycan-vampire. Over the course of their forbidden love, they killed both vampires and lycans (well, in all fairness, Selene does 99% of the killing; and despite Michael's supposed \\"power\\", he barely kills anything) and became hunted by both. Under the direction of Len Wiseman, who did UNDERWORLD and UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION, the story was bloody, wild, exciting, sexy and darned entertaining. Then we got UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS, directed by the great production designer Patrick Tatopolis, and that was a big mess of a prequel designed to shed more light on why the war started and to elaborate on the characters of Lucien (a lycan) and Sonja (a vampire) and their forbidden love. That film was almost unwatchable, and not because it was so bad, but because the film's lighting in almost every scene is so incredibly dark it looks like they shot it entirely in a black hole.<br /><br />Now we have UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein, a Swedish filmmaking duo, and this is their first major studio release. U: A begins with an energetic and shocking opening as humans have discovered the existence of vampires and werewolves and are in the process of exterminating them all. Gone are the days of the fun, comic-booky adventures of orgiastic violence and almost campy intrigue and now we have a film that is trying to hold a mirror up to the human condition. Words like \\"Purge\\" and \\"Cleansing\\" are used as Humanity bands together to wipe out these \\"sub-human\\" monsters. Selene and Michael are trying to escape to safety, but these jack-booted kill squads find them and...<br /><br />The next thing we know is that Selene is in a research lab of the AntiGen Corporation hanging upside-down and naked in cryogenic stasis but is being released by something referred to as Subject Two. Selene, once released, finds all of her old clothes (the latex skintight bodysuit, the cool boots, the leather bustier) just being stored in a glass container. Before you can say \\"suspension of disbelief\\", she's back to blue-eyed business killing everybody she sees in order to escape and also to find Michael. What she does find is an ally in the impossibly handsome David (Theo James, all cheekbones) and the fact that she's been in stasis for 12 years. We also meet the antagonist, a very Mengele-type big-shot doctor, Jacob Lane (the usually terrific Stephen Rea, trying desperately to keep his face out there), who seems determined to make sure that the government and his own private army get Selene and Subject Two back. We then find that Subject Two is a 12-year-old girl (what a coincidence!) named Eve, who is a hybrid, like Michael (another coincidence!). I won't spoil who she is, but Selene suddenly has a really big reason to protect her. In the midst of all this, David's father Thomas (the great Charles Dance), the leader of a nearby vampire coven, looks to run and hide, and his headstrong son looks to stand their ground and fight against the humans. Then we get a Hulk-sized lycan, a vampire-friendly cop (Michael Ealy), and a really fun final act where all the serious stuff goes out the window in favor of watching Selene blast her way through impossible odds with her twin machine pistols.<br /><br />While the previous films haven't been really big on character development, they did slow down enough to allow some of the newer characters to breathe life into those characters. This is another in the long line of \\"We can't make the characters relatable, so at least we'll make them blow stuff up\\" action films, like the masters of that kind of cinema (Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich) but with a tenth of the budget they get. My three biggest problems with the film are these:<br /><br />First is that Marlind and Stein seem to be combining the styles of both Wiseman and Tatopolis without any real style of their own. The film does have some pretty fun gags and setpieces like the Wiseman films do, but the film also looks really dark, which may be less of a stylistic choice and more of a symptom of the standard sub-standard lousy 3D post-conversion.<br /><br />Second, the entire cast, with maybe the exception of Beckinsale, seems to be cashing a check here. They don't really do anything interesting or have anything interesting to do other than stand around and glare occasionally. Becks (that's what I call her) knows that this franchise is built around her and she needs to be on her game. The rest of the cast seems to be sleep-walking. And was Wes Bentley just in the neighborhood when they were filming? Because that was a waste of talent and he's certainly not recognizable enough to be a \\"cameo\\". That was just bizarre.<br /><br />Third, and perhaps the biggest turn-off, is the injection of unnecessary allegorical storytelling that's too much of a reminder of reality to really allow for the same kind of popcorn-munching entertainment that the first two films had going for them. While the first two films were not the breeziest pieces of entertainment, they never took themselves too seriously. With AWAKENING, there's the blasts of violence and energy to the film, but then it's weighed itself down with the persecution of vampires and lycans by humans, some of whom have an interest in creating a more \\"superior\\" race. Of course, a film with four different screenwriters (one of them being Wiseman himself and another being J. Michael Straczynski, who is best-loved as creating the TV program BABYLON 5, and who is most-hated for really screwing up Spider-Man during his run on the comic book), someone is bound to trip over someone else's ideas. It seems like each writer wrote about 30 pages of the script and then handed it to another writer with a completely different style wanting to tell a completely different story. if you watch the film, you may notice that the tone shifts about seven times throughout the runtime. The allegory within the film is absolutely without any kind of merit since the films themselves were able to sustain themselves simply on the conceit of Vampires vs Werewolves.<br /><br />That being said, the film is pretty entertaining once you get past all the heavy-handedness. Becks continues to rock the outfit VERY well, and while her tone is much more serious here than it's been before, she plays it well. And to be fair to Marlind and Stein here, at least every shot of Selene walking away from the camera isn't shot at buttock-level, like Wiseman (Kate's husband) did constantly. The final act is a lot of fun, except there was one thing (a pretty important thing to be sure, as far as plot is concerned) that I was waiting for that just didn't come, presumably because they're saving it for a sequel.<br /><br />One more thing: The idea of the Hybrid being this all-powerful being was kind of stupid until this film, because we finally see a Hybrid doing a good amount of damage.<br /><br />It's not the most pleasant of universes to step in as far as the New World Order of UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING to visit, and you surely don't want to live there, but it's not an altogether terrible place to visit.racters.

B006WAIUEK|5.0|Skagboys is a worthy prequel in the 'Trainspotting' trilogy and a five star read. In the novel the exploits of its now famous four characters (Rents, Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie) come of age in the Thatcherite dystopia of early 1980s working class Edinburgh. Welsh's characters face a world of tough choices, unemployment, drugs and generational poverty with a headlong rage that is the authors trademark. The hardback books hefty 548 pages highlights the family friends and developing `love interests' of the principal characters as they move, mate and scheme from the Port of Leith and into the wider world. Skagboys is vintage Welsh, with some of the best characterisation to date of his anti heroes at work rest and play. The novel is at times sad, bad, hilarious and profound with imagery and dialogue that's pure catnip to the converted/perverted Welsh reader.

B004SEUIXS|1.0|Thirty-five. That is the approximate number of times I was obliged to bellow the usual two-word, seven-letter refrain at the screen while watching this abomination of cinema. That would bring the total number of instances I've bellowed this phrase at a movie to perhaps forty. This could be the most aggressively, nauseatingly saccharine film ever made and watching it is like being gassed with whimsy and sat on by a giant Teddy bear.<br /><br />Every other movie I've ever seen is a better movie than 'Amelie', but it will appeal very well to people who'd rather live in a different universe. It picks up real, living humans and uses them like toys, like terminally uninformed parodies of humanity. It squanders reality. See that bar-maid there? That actress playing her is probably a fascinating woman - I'm SURE she's a fascinating woman - people tend heavily to be fascinating. Sadly though, this cartoon of a film allows no manifestation of any side of any of its performers' personalities to show through at any point. I have never, ever been more infuriated by a movie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's previous film was 'Alien: Resurrection', which goes part-way, but not all the way, toward explaining why this movie is as bad as it is.<br /><br />Although there is ever so much more to be said, that's about all I'm going to say about 'Amelie'. I'd like to tell you that this is because the film's Hadesian wretchedness is beyond my ability to properly describe, but that would constitute a falsehood on the scale of 'Amelie'. The truth is that I am dismayed by the idea of exerting any more mental energy contemplating this grotesque puppet show. That the film receives such unbroken acclaim is a dreary testament to the desire of so very many people for movies that provide an escape from any form of recognizable life. For Jean-Pierre Jeunet to spit in my face would be so much kinder than what he did to me by making this movie it would constitute an atonement.<br /><br />(Note: Buried in the film's sound-track is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard; a version of 'Guilty' sung by Albert Bowlly in 1931. An acquaintance haplessly gave this film to me, and afterwards I told her that, although it was the single most detestable film I'd ever seen, without it I'd surely have gone the rest of my days without having heard that sublime melody, and was grateful to her. My relationship with that song will end only at the hour of my death, unlike my relationship with this film and its director, which terminates with the completion of this sentence.)
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Two words to describe this production: holy crap!<br /><br />I've been a Phantom fan (or is it phan?) ever since I saw the show in Los Angeles with Michael Crawford in 1990.  Since that performance, I have seen it several more times, but I have yet to see one that was able to match it in quality and emotion.  Well my friends, the search is over.  In sports, there is an old saying that athletes should leave it all out on the field.  This performance is the theatrical equivalent of leaving it all out on the field.<br /><br />Let me start off with the casting.  To quote the Phantom, it is, in a word, ideal.  Ramin Karimloo is clearly one of the stage stars of this decade and is an inspired choice to play the Phantom.  His presence on stage might have been enough, but his booming, brooding voice really makes the character come alive.  There is an apocryphal story that when Karimloo first saw a performance of Phantom as a teenager, he bet his friends that one day he would play the Phantom.  Not only did that come true, but it's even all the more amazing considering he has never had any formal vocal training.  Sierra Boggess is tremendous as Christine.  You can seriously feel her anguish oozing off the screen.  Beautiful voice, and every word comes through nicely.  Raoul is always a troublesome character to cast.  For some reason, the actors who typically play him come off as kind of wussy and stiff.  But not here.  The producers chose Hadley Fraser, a West End veteran, but one who has never played Raoul.  His Raoul is the first one to actually have a spine and come off as forceful and the protector that Christine seeks.  In the final scene, Fraser looks ready to throw down with the Phantom.  And he also has a great voice to boot.  I will say this, though: he did wear a bit too much eye make-up for my taste. =D<br /><br />Another thing that makes this production work so well is that all of the performers really give their all.  You can feel and see the emotions of the characters so much more clearly than in any normal stage production thanks to the multiple camera angles used.  By the end of the show, you feel just as breathless as the actors.  You can really see them working on stage - you can see the sweat running down their faces from the hot stage lights and the makeup starting to run a bit.  That's how you know it's live. Some of the camera work could have been better, but overall they did a good job capturing a live performance with a slightly modified set to accommodate the limitations at Royal Albert Hall.  The lighting could also have been improved slightly, but I don't feel it really detracted from the overall show.<br /><br />A cool bonus at the end of the performance is the appearance of the original London cast, including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.  Brightman sang, but Crawford curiously did not.  Then, four previous Phantoms appeared on stage - Anthony Warlow, John Owen Jones, Colm Wilkinson, and Peter Joback - and sang a duet with Brightman and then alternated on \\"Music of the Night.\\"  Really amazing stuff, although I think it was wrong to leave out Howard McGillin from that group, since he played the Phantom more than anyone in history.<br /><br />All in all, this video is ten times better than the horrendous movie version that came out all those years ago with Gerard Butler.racters so much more clearly than in any normal stage production thanks to the multiple camera angles used.

B007L96SI6|5.0|You know the drill - a cutie gets 15 minutes on Idol and is long forgotten after the tour is over. If she is lucky enough to land a record deal, the label usually plays it safe by releasing what feels more like a marketing tie-in than an actual work of art. Even when that tactic works (as in Adam Lambert's For Your Entertaimnent) it often feels as if a bunch of overpaid songwriters and producers threw a bunch of leftover tracks at the wall to see if any particular sound or style would stick.<br /><br />Needless to say, my hopes were high and my expectations were low when it took a year to the day from the Idol finale for Haley Reinhart to release her debut. \\"It was worth the wait\\" has never held more meaning. WOW - this soars above every other Idol debut I have heard. This is not a quick cash-in, this is a work of art that will hold up for the ages.<br /><br />Kudos to Hailey for co-writing 13 of the 14 tracks. This album works as a statement, like Adele's 21. If Amy Winehouse's Back in Black was Jack Daniels on the rocks, Listen Up is a delicious mimosa.<br /><br />The ALBUM: 10 exquisite songs, many of which should be #1 singles: Wasted Tears and Wonderland are near perfect and \\"Oh My!\\" is a stunner, featuring the fat, heavy, funky Dap Kings-esque horns sound that Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse and The Heavy have employed to glorious effect. Then the rap interlude comes in (awesome, not needed, but surely makes this track even more radio friendly). The 10 tracks work as a stylistic complete statement: retro-fueled futuristic jazzy funk.<br /><br />The EP (also available ala carte from Apple): These four tracks work well on their own - they break away from the cohesion of the album and venture into other styles. A testament to her versatility. Follow Me is a slow burn pop song; Spiderweb builds from delicate piano riff into a Lady Gaga-esque jam; What You Don't Know is a straight up 70's disco/pop song, Let's Run Away evokes The Weepies, Norah Jones and Haley's cohort Casey Abrams.<br /><br />Haley has a bright career ahead of her IF this album sells. It's on sale - go get it!Casey Abrams.<br /><br />Haley has a bright career ahead of her IF this album sells. It's on sale - go get it!
B0007TKNII|3.0|When this movie came out in the theater back in 2004, I thought it was actually pretty good.  However, as the years have passed and I have watched the DVD multiple times, I realize that I was wrong.  It has not withstood the test of time and the more I watch it, the more disappointed I become.  The movie lacks the most important aspect of any motion picture: emotion.  With perhaps the exception of Gerard Butler as the Phantom, most of the actors turn in a cookie-cutter, ho-hum performance that fails to meet what should be the  high expectations for this musical.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice as Christine.  However, she could not deliver a good performance overall.  In the scenes that required her to show some sense of emotion, all she can do is stare wide-eyed at everything, like a deer in the headlights.  She did that so much I wondered if her eyes are permanently stuck that way.  And then there's Patrick Wilson as Raoul.  Initially, it seemed like a good casting choice because he had Broadway experience.  But watching him play Raoul was like watching Keanu Reeves play Raoul.  Again, absolutely no emotion to speak of.  Also, what really got me was the age difference between Rossum and Wilson.  Christine and Raoul were supposed to be childhood sweethearts, according to the story.  But Wilson is at least 10 years older than Rossum if he's a day.  So are we to believe that when he was 17, he was in love with a 7 year old? (shudder.)<br /><br />Gerard Butler gave the only memorable performance.  He had all the Phantom moves down, including the swishing of his cape, and did pretty well vocally.  But the make-up job on him was horrendous.  The Phantom is supposed to be hideous and ugly.  When his mask is pulled off, it looked like he just had a few burns here and there.  I was hardly repulsed.  That's not Butler's fault, however.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to see how it's really done, I strongly recommend getting the recently released 25th anniversaryperformance of Phantom.  There you will find everything that is sorely missing from this film.

B007XF4J70|5.0|If you have neither room nor can justify for the collectors edition box see the standalone blu ray has everything you need a wonderful sharp well presented transfer of the 1942 Classic and hours upon hours of extras from a Looney Tunes short (which does fall flat as it was done years after Mel Blanc had passed) to everything shown alongside Casablanca (news reels shorts ect) Documentaries, deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />Obviously the film is a classic and there is nothing I can say about that hasn't already been said in the 70 years since this film was made. I myself only just saw it for the first time and a second time just a few hours prior to writing this review.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about getting this film on blu ray, don't be pick it up you won't regret doing so.
B007HO392S|5.0|I'm suprised to say, but I really like this album. I'm not a country fan and listen to mostly rock, alternative, etc. However, this album is suprisingly really good to me. Every song is enjoyable to listen to. Her voice is great.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|I decided to download this app because Amazon was promoting $2 off select $5 albums if I download it with this app with my android device or Kindle Fire. Well, I tried downloading the app on my Kindle Fire and it says it's NOT compatible on my device. Wouldn't that be false advertising?
B007JM4CWY|5.0|My favorite part of this game is trying to guess what the picture is going to be before your done.  The other five star reviews give accurate enough information about the playability and I agree with them.  Stylus use is not a must but would make it easier.  That is not a fault of the app just the nature of the game on a tiny screen.<br /><br />Update:  I finally completed all the puzzles in this app.  I am now working on CrossMe Color.  So from May 2012 ish to JAN 2013 ish  I say that's a pretty good app.

B0084YC5UC|4.0|I am addicted to this show, and have been since Season 1. I actually bought the first 4 seasons as soon as they were released, watched the episodes once, breathlessly, and donated them to the public library.<br />Now, I'm watching each episode on my laptop through Amazon's instant video. Today there was nothing even though it was supposed to be on AMC!<br />Can anyone tell me why?<br />BTW I feel that most of the episodes this season have been weaker than the previous.<br />Does anyone agree?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you're looking for the adult version of Twilight, you've found the book series. Ana's clumsy, virginal, relationship-withdrawn character is exhaustingly similar to Bella Swan's and Christian's reserved, secretive, You-should-stay-away-from-me-because-I'm-not-good-for-you type of personality (and not to mention outrageous good looks and wealth) are that of Edward Cullen's, minus the fangs. The author's immature and youthful style of writing made it almost uncomfortable to read the book because of the author's portrayal of Ana as a young, I-just-tripped-over-my-own-two-feet-in-front-of-a-cute-guy kind of character. I expected adult characters--I wasn't expecting twenty year old college \\"Twilights\\" all over again, only with dirty talk thrown lazily around Ana's fumbles and constant blushing (sound familiar??).
B004WZGHLU|1.0|This item is not advertised clearly enough. It is not meant for US region DVD players and it was too late for me to return the items by the time I found this out. Unless you have a PAL format player, do not buy this item. It will not play! It never occurred to me that I would have to check the format of a DVD I was buying on a US site. I learned the hard way and now I'm out $70. I don't want anyone else to go through the same experience. I tried to troubleshoot the problem by updating my DVD player's software. The DVDs begin to play the 2 Entertainment animation and then go straight back to the DVD player's home screen. I contacted Movie Emporium about the issue and when they did not respond to my second email about returning the item as they promised through their \\"No Quibbles\\" return policy I contacted Amazon and was told I was no longer eligible for the A-Z Guarantee Claim.<br /><br />In the end, I'm still out the $70 and I re-purchased these DVDs from TARGET.

B0086T71MM|5.0|A lot is happening in this episode of Mad Men, all of it heartbreaking and it all makes for one of the best episodes of the season. The race to get the Jaguar account is still on and difficulties abound. The Jaguar continues to be an expensive and unreliable car and the agency hopes to compare it to a mistress, but needs the slogan - a slogan that Don is having trouble creating. One of the Jaguar executives wants Joan's company for an evening, and not as Pete puts it for dinner and dancing. It is right that Pete should define the terms as he is the weasel who pimps and pitches the propisition to Joan. The rest of the men are aghast and don't want Joan to do it but Pete is convinced that this is the only way they will get the account - even if Don comes through with his ususal brilliance. In his stress, Don is lashing out at both Peggy and Megan and Peggy is considering pursuing another opportunity. Megan is hoping she gets a part with an out of town try out.<br /><br />The episode highlights the differences for women and working women in particular without preaching or being heavy-handed. All of the female characters are asked to prostitute themselves in some way, either literal or metaphoric and their femininity is still their defining characteristic to the men in their world, despite what they do and how they function. Don is surprisingly moral and Pete unsurprisingly adds pander to his many slimey accomplishments. Lane is pragmatic and fond of Joan and advises that if forced to sell oneself to get the best possible price and to get it up front. Roger and Cooper are as ineffectual as ever. The editing of Don's pitch and Joan's decision about what to do is a brilliant bit of filming. The depth of Don's feelings for Peggy are finally revealed and end by being as sad as the rest of tonight's show.<br /><br />These characters were never paragons but tonight they all participated in the corruption that would emblematize America as it went forward into the seventies and eighties; they did it for understandable reasons and they remain good but flawed people but the worm is in the apple. A brilliant, brilliant episode that shows us why Mad Men is not only one of the best shows on television but is destined to be remembered as a classic.

B00335EQ3Q|5.0|Very beautiful collector's item. I knew the film from a BBC channel about five years ago and became recently obsessed to have the dvd. I found out that there was a 2010 release special edition but a pity only a region 1 version. I have to play it on my PC but that's no problem. Right afterwards I ordered a Korean release 2003 also a special edition but suitabele for all regions. With all background information I realised the difficulties of making the film and that Cannes made it fortunately a succes.

0449806979|5.0|I finished this audio book about a month ago, and it was awesome. It's one of those books, I picked up on a whim, and never expected to love it as much as I did.  Sometimes when this happens, I put off doing a review for a long while, feeling like I can't possibly give the book a good enough review.<br /><br />The author was a former Wall Street Journal reporter who after leaving her job, moved to Paris to be with her new love, Simon, a British Journalist.  The couple marries and she soon finds out she is pregnant. Being that her first baby will be born and raised in France,  she sees herself at a definite disadvantage even before the baby is born. She doesn't ever speak the language well, her family is in the US, and although she has never raised a child, it is already obvious to her early on that French parents do things differently beginning when the infant is only a few months old.<br /><br />For example, French babies are eased into the family's routine, and the parents do not rush to always pick up the baby when the baby first starts to whimper.  Parents believe that by do this early on, teaches little ones to wait, teaching them early on self-discipline, which leads to calmer children later on. The French claim that this helps the babies to \\"do their nights\\" (sleep through the night) quicker as well. Very important as most French women who worked before their pregnancy do return to work within a few months after the baby is born.<br /><br />Another observation by Druckerman was that French toddlers and their parents for that matter, seem calmer and more relaxed. Her observations revealed generally pleasant eating out experiences for parents and child. She notes how, early on young children are eased into the (3) meals a day plus a snack routine. A routine that fits the life of the family.  They eat what the parents eat early on, and even seem to enjoy fish, meats and vegetables and other grown up foods that some American children might turn their noses up at.  American children are offered many many \\"choices\\" according to the French way of thinking.  French children are not allowed to snack at random times of the day.  Another difference that I was surprised by was the fact that while many American parents are constantly praising their little ones, every time they do something that pleases the parents, French parents are not as generous with their praise, their goal being is to raise calm children, educate them and to teach them how to behave properly.<br /><br />There were many other observations that made me stop and think as well. I liked this book, because it was not one-sided. It did not depict either American parenting or French parenting to be the best way to raise a child. Parents are encouraged to take hold of their own lives, and by doing so they will raise independent, well-adjusted children. I liked that the author's findings were based on a lot of observation. From child-care settings, schools and even parks and even play times.  The story is written in a humorous and engaging manner, that captured my interest early on. You don't have to be a young parent to enjoy this book.  The audio reader, Abby Craden did a great job.

B003TJR2HS|3.0|This does work like it's supposed to - you can put it between your iPhone and the iHome and not have to take the case off of the iPhone. There are 2 problems 1) it's really hard to get it just right on the iHome dock for some reason 2) the iPhone tilts slightly backwards and it seems like it needs some support behind it or over time it's going to break off from the weight of the iPhone itself. I do love not having to take my Otterbox off every night to charge my iPhone.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|A new take on the race to prevent nuclear war commonly seen in James Bond movies. Even though the cold war is supposed to be dead this movie creates a fresh approach to international covert wars and keeps you engaged and not bored. The movie keeps jetting you around the glob and wraps it up nicely in the end of course--it is how they do it that you stay aboard to see. The main issue I have with these movies is how ordinary people like Tom Cruise's character, in the current day action and adventure movies, and the like can jump off the side of a building slam themselves into a movie car with with bodies and get up and sprint off--no broken bones or anything. But when someone kicks them right before they get their hands on a gun or nuclear war head deactivation device they are slowed down . . . crippled. It is contrived of course and you feel manipulated. Anyway the only other issue I had with this movie is how it portrays India as a modern country with gleeming streets and skyscrapers etc that a movie is set in while 90% of the country is awash in poverty and disease infested slums. But all in all this is worth seeing. If you are afraid of heights you might want to skip this one as there is more than one scene intensified by height

B005OK721G|1.0|For those that compared this movie to Man on Fire, Denzell Washington is rolling over in his grave and the man's not even dead yet.  This movie has no plot, no point, and is the latest of a series of action movies out of Hollywood that just suck.  Save your money - I actually want my $14.99 back from Amazon.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|We live in an age where books are too easily published and perhaps too readily available; sorting out the trash from the treasure is getting more and more difficult.  I've found myself becoming hesitant to take a chance even on seemingly cheap books in the kindle store as some of these new authors works are not worth even a minute of my time.  However, when I saw how many 5 star reviews this one had (too many for them all to be fakes), I decided to take a chance on it.  So.glad.I.did.  This is an incredibly complex book; not in the sense of an intricate, difficult to follow plot with too many characters (cough..Wheel of time..cough).  It seems fairly straightforward as you go, but as you near the end the sense of the incredible machination that has led Vaelin from childhood to the place we find him in the end is just unbelievable.  Kudos upon kudos to the author who is able to pull it off.  I really enjoyed that characters are allowed to grow and change.  Nortah is a prime example.  In most works, they would have been enemies from childhood on.  However, just as in the real world, he is allowed to grow from the great tragedy he experiences and becomes a totally different person by the time we see the last of him.  I really appreciate that.  The only annoying things about the book were the typos.  They were not as myriad as some books I've read, but it is annoying.  The word \\"lead\\" was consistently spelled \\"led\\" throughout the book and it was always a bit of a hiccup to come across it while immersed in the story.  Other than that, I really have nothing but great praise for this book.  It is definitely going on my \\"will read over and over\\" list and I can't wait for the sequel to come.  Though, I'm a bit nervous he won't be able to match this incredible work.

0545265355|5.0|This is by far the most addictive book series I've ever read. I couldn't put the book down and even when I wasn't reading I was thinking about the books. The characters are inspiring, there's so mucho to learn from them... I only have compliments for Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />Maybe the ending of the trilogy wasn't what I was waiting for, but I think it was appropriate and realistic. I loved all the three books, but my favorite was Catching Fire.<br /><br />Just read them, you won't regret it!
B004LSO6YI|5.0|This movie was simply phenomenal.  I'm not going to rehash all the wonderful things that were already said here and by people who reviewed the DVD.  I want to touch on 2 characters other than the main. Elena and Peyton are magic together yet so many people missed the point of Tyler and Peyton's best friend (from across the street--I forgot her name)....and what they did for Elena and Peyton.<br />Throughout this movie, Tyler (The Love Guru) was nothing but positive as well as a dear friend to Elena while Peyton's best friend was negative Nancy to Peyton.<br /><br />During the entire length of this movie, she offered nothing positive in terms of her friends feelings or possible new relationship.  I watched this wanting to reach thru my screen and strangle Eve every time she opened her mouth.<br />IMO, the best friend was a catalyst to Peyton's doubts.  Had she provided just a glimmer of positive enforcement, I don't think Peyton would've cracked when things got rough for Elena....anyway, HAD to get that off my chest.<br /><br />Someone commented that these lovelies had some of the longest kiss scenes in which I enjoyed every minute of and YES, the sex was exquisite, intensely hot and seductive!!

B00280LYIC|4.0|I am a great admirer of Rick Riordan - his books are well written, well plotted and very funny. And if you don't come away with a reasonable working knowledge of Greek mythology then you're just not paying attention. Whenever people ask for recommendations for kids books, the Percy Jackson series are always at the top of the list. I've read bits of The Lightning Thief before and seen the film, so was pleased this month to have the opportunity to read the entire book. I came away impressed with the book and disappointed with the film. There are so many nice moments in the book that just feel like they were written for the film, and yet were completely left out. I would love to know Rick Riordan's honest take on the film - \\"smile and think of my bank balance, smile...\\"

B001UV4XUG|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt assumes the role of Tom Hansen, a young aspiring architect tied to a mundane job at a greeting card company.  It is through this mundane job, however, that he meets Zooey Deschanel's character, the bewitching free spirit Summer Finn.  The ensuing events play out in way that is quite familiar from my days as a young single person.  Despite Summer's perennial denigration of the possibility that she would ever elect for a committed relationship, Tom continues to pursue her in hope that she might just be \\"the one\\" and come to think of him in the same way.  Over the course of 500 days, a sampling of which are played forwards and backwards in time, there are moments of joy and closeness interspersed with those filled with alienation and frustration--much like those found in actual relationships.<br /><br />The moments of drama in this film are tempered by a sort of retrospective provided towards the end of the story.  Weeks after they have gone their separate ways, the two have a heartfelt chat on a park bench.  The role of coincidence in meeting one's love is discussed--a thought that I have always found both wonderful and unnerving.  How one, especially a girl like Summer, finally knows that she has met the person with whom she wants a committed relationship is also explored--though, at the same time, the reasons and events behind her new feelings remain an impenetrable enigma.<br /><br />Unlike other romantic films, this movie is not so much about what true love is, but what it isn't.  The benefits of a failed or painfully ended relationship are, however, also revealed--and in a way that is not stupid or sappy.  Tom knows himself and his goals in life much better after the tutorial provided by Summer.  Perhaps for young people still \\"out there\\" and looking for love, this story might also suggest the need to look out for the literal events that mark the point where a relationship is exposed as intractable--and that it is time (or, more likely, way past time) to move on!ast time) to move on!

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Keeps you guessing and turning pages trying to figure the whole thing out.  the first couple chapters are puzzling and you wonder where this was going.  Enjoyed the change in the main character especially with the child.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally it is here. when I found it I got really excited so what I did was download it quickly as fast as I can. Then I started playing it. I played for 2 straight hours. that shows how much I love this game. GO TEMPLE RUN!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!&iexcl;!!!!
B005LAIGOQ|1.0|I'm sorry, after Harry Potter, this guy has no acting career. He's absolutely terrible in this movie. He's basically playing himself in a bad mood after a bad meal at a restaurant. You get the impression, like any movie Channing Tatum also is in, that the film would be better with a different actor. Whereas Robert Pattinson was amazing in Water For Elephants and proved he wasn't just another teen heartthrob with no acting ability, Radcliffe looks spoiled and frustrated in this film. He just doesn't have what it takes to be an actor, nor the desire, it seems. I would never watch another movie with him as the lead.
0345803485|1.0|I am so glad that others found this book not worthy of all the talk.  Who is this woman's PR person and where can I find them?  This is a case of really good marketing, everyone seems to be talking about this book.  Which, is...clearly trash.  I've even heard it called \\"mommie porn.\\"  Really?  This is what grown women have fantasies about?  Either read a really good harlequin romance (yes, there is such a thing) or a good female porn book (Like Black Lace).  But this book is badly written, not really all that interesting, and the sex is uninspired and bordering on boring.  The female character is a whim, who seems to have no character of her own and is always so frightened of everything.  The male character is described as so hot and hard to handle, but really, isn't he just a broken shell of a man?  In the real world, who would want this guy?  I guess someone who likes to be degraded and beaten and finds one kind word acceptable in her relationship.<br />I can't believe there are two other books.  Who would want to read them?  I flipped through the pages of the first one, didn't even read the whole thing, and was annoyed that I had actually spent money to read this piece of crap.<br />Now they are making a movie of it?  How?  Can't really have a much of a story for a 2 hour movie, plus two sequels.  It makes me really angry that there are so many excellent writers trying to get their books published and this one not only does, it gets all this attention.  If you haven't already read this book, do yourself a favour and don't bother.  It really is not worth it.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Great classic movie by Hitchcock.  Fantastic picture in Blu-ray for a B&W film.  I highly recommended this movie for the serious collector.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this on my kindle fire,  and I'm SUPER happy that they have it now- I love this app and I played it all the time on my sisters Ipod. This is an awesome app and its fun and it works great on kindle fire!!!
B004ZG5F28|4.0|Purchased because my spouse liked this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Very entertaining.  Great picture in Blu-ray.  I highly recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Download from Amazon was quick, and i was happy that I purchased the Trilogy so there was no delay to finish the complete story!  I have yet to see the film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just a good, solid, basic calculator.  Great looking and, my version, FREE. You can't beat for the price.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|I went in expecting a movie with a basic plot and lots of explosions.  It's exactly what you get, with exception of a couple of kinks - There is some bad dialogue (cauliflower ear conversation and the church scene) and I could have done without the whole Jason Statham and his girlfriend subplot, but I still enjoy the movie.  Lots of action, ass kicking, and just good old 80's - 90's action movie style to it.  It's a great movie to throw in if you just want to kick back and watch guns, a sweet truck, fights, explosions, and a pretty sweet airplane.
B005HSL626|4.0|It could be more like the iPod version, with online play and the special pomegranate which you could hit multiple times, but other than that, its pretty fun and addicting, would of given it 5 stars but it didn't have what the iPod version had.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This game is highly addicting. I love the function where you can fill many spaces in a row the same at the same time. This game needs a function where you can zoom for the larger grid sizes.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong Deluxe HD is a great game and I really enjoy playing it.If you never played Mahjong you dont known what your missing.Try it you and your family will love it ; my family and I did. :)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this. It keeps your mind working & is great fun at the same time. Challenging & addictive.
B00633W614|5.0|Very engaging and entertaining.  Great character development and plenty of turns and twists in the story.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|I heard a while ago from someone that this was coming out at the end of april, and have waited a month now. My app collection is one step closer to perfection.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Ok so I figured out some things out easily in the first pages, making this book a predictable. But I was surprised how much I enjoyed the main character's journey to that ending and, though I usually don't like romances, I had inner 'awws' going on, which is big for me. One annoyance about the author, her main characters seem to always be ditzy women who are insecure. I loved the Shopoholic series but this main character was a little too reminiscent of the other. Still, great book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and I could not put it down. At first I thought I was going insane.... I never played video games...and now I cant put a video game down....IMPOSSIBILE!!!!....thoughs were my thoughts. Trust<br /> me this is all normal (they need a caution 99.9% chance of addiction guarenteed sign) Great game...:)
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I would like to start off saying that these are THE BEST headphones I have EVER heard in my life. The bass is JUST the right amount, not too much, not too lacking. Right in the middle. Unless you are a serious basshead these will work great. The clarity of the mids and highs is even more amazing. The mids are not recessed at all. Highs are brilliant.<br /><br />For this price it hurts to list the cons.<br /><br />The ear cushions are soft but the vinyl/pleather like material uses gets hot and sticky after only a short use. Not unbearable but pretty annoying. The highs are a little too much sometimes but using a Treble Reducer setting on an iPod fixes this. You could also use a graphic equalizer to lower 7kHz around 7db and will sound much better!<br /><br />If you need a good pair of headphones under $50 you can't go wrong here.<br /><br />P.S. I found these ear cushions which should fit the 681. which are much more comfortable for $15 on Amazon. Search \\"Sound Blaster World of Warcraft Headset ear cushions\\" at Amazon :)
B007SSEBCU|4.0|I found the acting superb.  But, the movie a little too slow. Though, I did like the way the story was told.
0670023329|5.0|I thought I knew about North Korea but I was wrong.  The horrors of what's going on today in that country is akin to the Holocaust.  Shocking but riviting story. Couldn't put it down.
B007MDB71O|3.0|This movie bombed at the box office. Might as well get that out of the way at the beginning. It was a financial disaster. That, however, has very little to do with the movie itself. Put aside the stupid naming and the bizarre advertising choices. Lets look at the movie itself.<br /><br />The movie is actually remarkably faithful in tone to the book Princess of Mars even while changing some of the specifics. Instead of trying to update Edgar Rice Burroughs vision, it simply embraces it. And that's probably my favorite thing about it. The creatures and devices are fantastical and the scale of the cities is epic.<br /><br />There's also plenty of action. Sword fights, flying, jumping. It's all there. And the plot, while simplistic (it's a blockbuster) is easy enough to follow.<br /><br />It's the characters where things fall down. Outside of John Carter and Dejah Thoris have decent character arcs, but no one else gets developed at all.<br /><br />Strangely John Carter seems both too long and too short at the same time. At 2 hours 20 minutes the story drags at times, yet some aspects feel like they were never properly fleshed out.<br /><br />Personally I think I would have cut down the framing story to a minimum and used that time to build up the secondary characters a bit more.<br /><br />Overall then it's a fun movie, but ultimately not very memorable. The best I can say for it is that it did inspire me to add the Barsoom series to my reading list.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|When you see \\"ultraviolet\\" digital copy you might as well read \\"vapor ware.\\" You don't get a copy for your hard drive, you have to use a complicated server system that has yet to stream successfully for me. If you want a digital copy buy it in HD from iTunes and still get most, of not  all, the special features.<br /><br />Plus, they keep a backup on iCloud now.<br /><br />Spend less on a disc only version if you want the disk.
B007SGM084|3.0|It was good books , second one went faster than the first one. Just wished I would have researched it first. But love buying from amazon
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I for one really enjoyed the conceit the author uses to tell this story.  The collection of interviews, which becomes a series of short stories, made it a quick read, but nonetheless disturbing and horrifying for it's content.  It really did make me wonder how different the real world would react to some viral threat like this, and I think Max Brooks came pretty damn close to how society would fall apart.  Definitely give this book a shot.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is really good I recommend it to all super Mario brothers fans its kind of a spin off

B0086700CM|5.0|well for awhile now ive watched other kids in college completely ignore the Prof. and then play this game under there desks. but ive always thought it looked stupid. now Ive played it I can see why it is sooooo addicting. one run just makes you want to do better. I can agree w/ the guy who gave one star on the second half of his review. the amazon app store SUCKS LIKE A MOSQUITO. The app store in my opinion should be replaced by the amazon app store or tootle play. of the few good games I have found, they got boring within a week. but since my mother has thrown my computer out the window (true story) ive been on my kindle a lot. but the one thing ive had to do to many times is go to the browser and download Apo files for games like knight elite order assault. but recently ive been seeing more and more of my friends on there device app stores and dear God, there awesome. its just that among all of the apps ive ever had that are good, they were downloaded through apk files on the web browser . now this is pissing me off endlessly. if someone actually checks this instead of some computer, please show it to your higher so that this message can go somewhere. I just want a new app store, or just a major change to the this one.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I could not be more pleased with the Soundfly AUX.  I bought it two months ago and have not taken it out of my car since. In fact, there really is no need to remove because it is easy to take out the SD Card and put in another.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Works as advertised.  Will Play MP3 files in high quality<br />2. Construction is sturdy (although I worry about how tight it fits in the power outlet.. see cons)<br />3. Fast Start up -- no lengthy time to scan a new or updated SD Card.<br />4. Good quality sound<br />5.  The Remote!<br />6. The device broadcasts the name of the song to my radio as well<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  The only con I have is that the device is very tight in my power outlet-- It takes a lot of force to get it out and I don't want to break it.  I ended up buying an extension cord (my outlet is right next to the floor) that I plug the Soundfly into to reduce the wear and tear on the connector.<br /><br />This product is really slick -- I now wish I had an MP3 player that could take SD cards--It is so convenient and easy to swap out music.

B007KZY1YY|5.0|These books (the fifty shades of grey trilogy) are fantastic and once again I couldn't put them down. Initially I didn't expect them to be as erotic as they are, but once I started reading them I found them captivating. They have a great story line that draws you in, making you want to read more. I am glad that there are 3 books as I would have been disappointed after finishing the first one.

0345803485|3.0|i was expecting a bit more than the general harlequin romance theme.  while the love scenes were very graphic and creative the basic story line was the usual rich man poor girl theme.  the thing that saved the books was the dark past that created the man.  this i found interesting from a psychological point of view.

B007L96SI6|5.0|I watch AI, and usually when I like a contestant's voice and style, they end up completely going backward for their first album, and then I forget about them after their disappointing debut. (Really the only exception to this is Kelly Clarkson.) Haley was one of the artists from season 10 with the most promise, and I was simultaneously excited and braced for disappointment when I downloaded her new album. Although, I had already heard 'Free' and listened to it about 25 times and loved it, so I was **slightly** optimistic.<br /><br />I can honestly say that this is the best post-Idol album I have ever heard. I enjoy every song. They really show off her voice, and the biggest thing is that the songs have a unique style, which is very refreshing after hearing all the \\"Pop\\" idol albums that have preceded this one. Because of that, I think it's safe to say that Haley has a bright future in music, and we will probably soon forget that she got her start on that silly TV show and come to think of her as a star in her own right.<br /><br />I do want to mention that the Amazon version of the album has only 10 songs, but there are four other songs available on iTunes and I think at Walmart stores. Admittedly, the 10 tracks Amazon has are the best of the bunch, but the other four are still worth listening to.

0385341008|5.0|The year is 1946, and Miss Juliet Ashton is touring England to promote her book `Izzy Bickerstaff Goes to War'. Originally a serial that appeared in `Spectator' to lift spirits by taking a humorous look at the war, the book is now selling splendidly and Juliet finds herself a legitimate authoress. The only problem is that she doesn't have much of an idea for a second book. The war is over, but Juliet is struggling (with the rest of the nation) to forget the horrors. Her flat was bombed to bits in 1942, and Juliet finds herself displaced in a Chelsea rental. Ration cards are still in circulation, to begin helping all those displaced persons across Europe (and Juliet will admit; it sticks in her craw that some of those persons are German).<br /><br />Waiting ever patiently for an idea to come to her is Juliet's dear friend and publisher, Sidney Stark (of Stephens & Stark Ltd.) who also happens to be the elder brother of her very best friend, Mrs Sophie Strachan. Ideas are even less forthcoming when rival American publishing tycoon, Markham V. Reynolds Junior takes to courting Miss Ashton - on the basis that she is the only woman to have ever made him laugh.<br /><br />And then a letter arrives . . .  a letter all the way from St. Martin's Parish, Guernsey - a small island (population approx 42,000) in the English Channel, between Weymouth in England and St. Malo in France.<br /><br />The letter is from one Mr. Dawsey Adams, who just so happens to be in possession of a book by Charles Lamb called `Selected Essays of Elia', once owned by Juliet, and which luckily contained her old address in the jacket cover. Dawsey Adams has a favour to ask of Juliet - if she would kindly give him the name of a London bookshop who could find him more books by Charles Lamb, and perhaps a biography? You see, Mr Lamb's essays helped Dawsey a lot during the German's five-year occupation of Guernsey - and he credits the essayist, and his own `Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society', with keeping him sane during the war.<br /><br />Never one to shy away from curiosity, Juliet replies with a Charles Lamb book for Dawsey, and burning questions about this Potato Peel Pie Society . . .  thus opening a Pandora's box into the little channel island; its inhabitants, their stories, their bravery during the war and the books that they came to cherish.<br /><br />Juliet starts receiving letters from all of the Guernsey Literary Society members. Amelia Maugery, whose stolen pig founded the Society. Eben Ramsey, who lost his daughter and son-in-law during the war, but who is now enjoying the return of his young grandson, Eli, after a five-year absence. Isola Pribby makes potions for the islanders, has a pet bird called Zenobia, and was haunted by `Wuthering Heights'. Juliet also receives cautionary letters from island busy-body and God-fearing woman, Adelaide Addison, who warns her against associating with such ragamuffins. During her letter-writing, Juliet also learns of Elizabeth McKenna . . . the Guernsey woman who thought up the literary society, and whose defiance of the German soldiers landed her in a concentration camp - she is still missing, but the islanders have hope that she will return - especially because her four-year-old daughter, Christina `Kit' awaits her return.<br /><br />`The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' was the 2008 bestseller from Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. Told entirely in letter-format, the book has been an unmitigated success since its release - and in 2013 it will be turned into a film, to be directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Kate Winslet.<br /><br />Believe all the hype you read and hear about this book - it's all entirely true. If anything, it's understated. `The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' has been on my radar for a few years now, and I'm ashamed to say I was only finally prompted into my reading when I heard that a movie was in the works. Regardless, this is one of those books that, no matter when or how you come to read it, you finish with the satisfactory and transcended feeling that you are better for having known these characters and their story.<br /><br />The book is entirely in letter format. Beginning with Juliet's letter to her friend and publisher, Sidney Stark, lamenting her book tour that forces her to be outgoing and charming, and despairing at having no ideas for a second novel. When Dawsey Adams's serendipitous letter arrives from Guernsey (courtesy of an old book Juliet donated, now in his possession, which contained her London address on the cover) he unknowingly triggers a chain of events that will lead Juliet to Guernsey and a story all their own.<br /><br />Through her correspondence with the various members of the town's Literary (and Potato Peel Pie) Society, Juliet begins piecing together the story of Guernsey's five long years under German occupation. The Channel Islands were among the first pieces of English soil to be conquered; much to Hitler's delight (he wrongly thought it would be a hop, skip, and a jump to London from the Channel). The Channel Islands were left defenceless by the British navy, who needed resources closer to home. Luckily, some children and mothers were successfully shipped off the island before the Germans arrived, and were placed in English homes for the duration of the war. What started as a friendly-enough occupation (despite two previous days of bombing) soon turned into a hellish enterprise. The Germans confiscated radios and cut phone cables - the islands were, literally, cut off from the rest of the world for five years. Then the Germans bought in Todt workers (prisoner slaves from all over Europe) - who were worked to death in fortifying the town against attack than never came. The Germans took the islander's food for their own, leaving them little provisions and towards the end of the war, starvation had set in. The price for stealing food or aiding Todt workers was imprisonment, concentration camp or death on the spot.<br /><br />Through her correspondence, first with Dawsey then Amelia, Isola, Eben and eventually the majority of the islanders, Juliet learns that the founder of the Literary Society was one Elizabeth McKenna. Elizabeth hastily came up with the idea of a Literary Society one night when she and a number of its members were caught by German soldiers in town after curfew - she quickly scrambled a lie together about getting caught up in their reading - a lie that saved them from jail, or worse. They were made to register their club with the commandant, and what started as a ruse quickly progressed into saving grace for many of the Society's members.<br /><br />Juliet learns of countless acts of heroism Elizabeth McKenna performed; from turning herself into a nurse, to helping hide a Todt worker from the Germans. And it was this last act of kindness that saw her shipped off to a concentration camp, yet to return to the island and her daughter, Kit . . .  a daughter, Juliet comes to learn, whose father was a German doctor called Christian Hellman; one of the few well-liked officers on the island. And so Juliet comes to wait, with bated breath like the rest of the islanders, for Elizabeth's return. And in the meantime, she travels to Guernsey herself, to meet these people she has come to care about, and call friend, and perhaps tell a story or two about. . .<br /><br />This book is a marvel. I had a bipolar reading experience with this one - laughing one moment and crying the next. Juliet is a wonderful narrator; in her early thirties, she's surprisingly relatable in her love life (between the swank American Mark Reynolds, and curiously shy Dawsey Adams) and hilarious in her private sufferings (which she shares with Sidney and Sophie - mostly about how scared she is to end up a cat lady spinster). But this is a book of many voices, and although Juliet is our primary narrator, with the majority of letters being to and from her, it'sthe islanders who often steal the spotlight.<br /><br />Isola Pribby is hilarious in her potion-stirring, head-bump-reading ways. Adelaide Addison calls her the island witch, but Isola is just a flamboyant, overly curious gem who goes through a revelation when she reads `Pride and Prejudice' for the first time. Amelia Maugery is a character you'll wish could be your grandmother in real life - a straight-talking woman whose empathy and kindness knows no bounds. And Kit McKenna, Elizabeth's four-year-old daughter, has a glare like Medusa's and an enviably steely spine - one of the best child characters I have read.<br /><br />Then there's Dawsey Adams - a man close to Juliet in age, he used to be the town recluse (partly because of his terrible stutter) but since meeting Juliet he has come more and more out of his shell, much to the delight of the Literary Society. He's a quiet but compelling man, whose presence commands any room he walks into, and who Juliet cannot help but fall for in the most delicious and heartfelt of romances.<br /><br />This book is fascinating for the story of the Channel Islands occupation during WWII alone. But what I really loved was the many revelations and proclamations about books - their healing power, ability to bring people together and aid individuals through dark times.<br /><br />I think Mary Ann Shaffer summarized the book best when she said in her afterword;<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I hope, too, that my book will illuminate my belief that love of art - be it poetry, storytelling, painting, sculpture, or music - enables people to transcend any barrier man has yet devised.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Marvellous as this book is, equally interesting is its inception. Mary Ann Shaffer had the seed for the story planted in 198o, but she didn't finish writing it until 2008. Sadly, by the time the first manuscript was complete and sold, Shaffer fell ill. Her health would not permit her to finish the editorial and rewriting process, and so she handed the reigns over to her niece, Annie Barrows (author of the children's book series, `Ivy and Bean') who finished the book for her. Mary Ann Shaffer died in February 2008.<br /><br />`The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' is now one of my favourite books. It is a story about people overcoming adversity together, and with the aid of characters and authors - in books that helped lift their spirits and take them out of the drudgery and travesty of war. This book will be passed on to my friends and family, for I firmly believe in Juliet Ashton's prediction that \\"there is some secret sort of homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers,\\" - and I hope that such an instinct finds this book in your hands very soon indeed.concentration camp or death on the spot.<br /><br />Through her correspondence, first with Dawsey then Amelia, Isola, Eben and eventually the majority of the islanders, Juliet learns that the founder of the Literary Society was one Elizabeth McKenna.

But this is a book of many voices, and although Juliet is our primary narrator, with the majority of letters being to and from her, it'sthe islanders who often steal the spotlight.<br /><br />Isola Pribby is hilarious in her potion-stirring, head-bump-reading ways. Adelaide Addison calls her the island witch, but Isola is just a flamboyant, overly curious gem who goes through a revelation when she reads `Pride and Prejudice' for the first time. Amelia Maugery is a character you'll wish could be your grandmother in real life - a straight-talking woman whose empathy and kindness knows no bounds. And Kit McKenna, Elizabeth's four-year-old daughter, has a glare like Medusa's and an enviably steely spine - one of the best child characters I have read.<br /><br />Then there's Dawsey Adams - a man close to Juliet in age, he used to be the town recluse (partly because of his terrible stutter) but since meeting Juliet he has come more and more out of his shell, much to the delight of the Literary Society. He's a quiet but compelling man, whose presence commands any room he walks into, and who Juliet cannot help but fall for in the most delicious and heartfelt of romances.<br /><br />This book is fascinating for the story of the Channel Islands occupation during WWII alone. But what I really loved was the many revelations and proclamations about books - their healing power, ability to bring people together and aid individuals through dark times.<br /><br />I think Mary Ann Shaffer summarized the book best when she said in her afterword;<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I hope, too, that my book will illuminate my belief that love of art - be it poetry, storytelling, painting, sculpture, or music - enables people to transcend any barrier man has yet devised.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Marvellous as this book is, equally interesting is its inception. Mary Ann Shaffer had the seed for the story planted in 198o, but she didn't finish writing it until 2008. Sadly, by the time the first manuscript was complete and sold, Shaffer fell ill. Her health would not permit her to finish the editorial and rewriting process, and so she handed the reigns over to her niece, Annie Barrows (author of the children's book series, `Ivy and Bean') who finished the book for her. Mary Ann Shaffer died in February 2008.<br /><br />`The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' is now one of my favourite books. It is a story about people overcoming adversity together, and with the aid of characters and authors - in books that helped lift their spirits and take them out of the drudgery and travesty of war. This book will be passed on to my friends and family, for I firmly believe in Juliet Ashton's prediction that \\"there is some secret sort of homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers,\\" - and I hope that such an instinct finds this book in your hands very soon indeed.
B005SLS3VY|4.0|Sitting down to a Michael Connelly is always a pleasure if you enjoy legal/courtroom dramas.The Reversal is no exception. A convicted child murderer secures release from jail after 20+ years. The DA decides to re-charge him, enter Mickey Haller,PROSECUTOR, for a dedicated defense attorney!My only criticism is the relationship between the two half brothers, Haller and Bosch is not all that convincing; and the ending was only OK. Minor quibbles. Connelly is one of the best legal thriller writers - as long as Haller is in it.<br /><br />Geoff Lambert - \\"The Morozov Inheritance\\"

B0080YGZ20|5.0|Listen to this album. Don't just skim through the songs and judge without a good listen. I made the mistake of listening to Settle Down for 30 sec and thinking \\"Meh, its ok\\". Something drew me in and I was back to listening to her music. I must admit that the australian version tells a better story then the American version, but both show how unique Kimbra's musical style is. I really suggest checking out the youtube videos also. They are fantastic!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|For a teen novel, this story exhibits lots of different plots and sub-plots. It's an engaging, original, and easy read that will have you reaching for the next installment before you know it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased this first book in the trilogy after reading about it being a \\"marriage changer\\".  What all the reviews I have heard neglected, is that it is an amazing love story.  Remove the sex and it is still so worth the read.  I bought the rest of the trilogy and have read them all twice, so far.
B0086700CM|5.0|What a fun game! I stumbled across this game and it is officially my new favorite game. I never got into Angry Birds - but this... I played til my eyes hurt and my finger tip was numb. It is free people - get it while that lasts.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Purchased on Lego.com. $12.99 is Best Price with Prime on Amazon. More appreciation once you see the movie. You get Captain America which is pretty awesome with his shield. The value is fair at $12.99 because there are a few new pieces. Good if you want to collect all of the figures from the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|FINALY TEMPLE RUN FOR KINDLE FIRE!!!! Ive waited soo long for this game to be on my kindle!!!! I got so excited when I saw this I went and downloaded it asap!!!!
1439163154|1.0|I got a review copy that had been passed among a group of people, and I am very glad that I didn't buy it. I really tried to give this a chance...I really did, but the McWriting workshop approach and the unashamed navel gazing were really too much for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game. enjoyed playing it. I love the variety of puzzles.  very challenging too.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone
B003L77G38|5.0|This series continues to evolve and yet stay fresh.  I am glad Peter is still there it would not be the same without him.  Walter is always amazing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play before bed to wind down after a long hectic day. I hate the pop ups that appear when playing the game
B00723NWJE|5.0|I bought Norah Jones' first CD before she became very popular, have loved her from that point on, and I have everything she has released so far. Although different from her previous releases I find this release to be absolutely amazing. Everyone that has listened to it with me has also loved it. She is extremely talented. I highly recommend this release!

B000KKPN5C|4.0|I am an amateur photographer and wanted to step up from the pop-up flash on my Nikon D5100.  As someone who is nowhere close to being a professional, I really did not want to invest a lot of money in a flash. I don't do a lot of portraits or low light situations but wanted something a bit more powerful that the onboard flash.<br /><br />This flash does exactly what I want it to do without the frills. It simply locks into the hot-shoe port and overrides the pop-up flash. Controlling it is done through the camera interface. The flash itself uses AA batteries which are say to come by. The only downside to such a basic flash using AA batteries is that there is no indicator to alert you of the depletion of the batteries. Simply put, if the batteries are dead, it just won't fire. Some sort of advance warning would be nice but for the low price, I am not hugely upset over the lack of this feature.<br /><br />It fires rapidly and produces a good amount of light. The head aims up for bouncing the light and then pivots to a few pre-determined angles.  For the beginner, this is a decent flash from the manufacturer.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG finally. I can play temple run on kindle fire I love this game I have been waiting for this update. It is so fun I always played on my friend's ipod. yessssssss!
B0053VKP8S|4.0|As described -- works well<br /><br />i use this to connect my new apple tv (which has an optical out) to my amplifier (which does not have an optical IN).  it works well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I agree with another reviewer who said there are some well written erotic books out there, this is not one of them.  Feels like it was written by a kid. Some of the erotic scenes were good, but story line was kind of a kid rewriting the romance in Thomas Crown Affair without the cleverness of the plot. Save you money.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Interesting topic, easy read.  Liked it  I was encouraged to see the movie.  The book is usually better, movie leaves out things that I felt was important to the story.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is the first time I've played this kind of puzzle.  Loads of fun.  Lots of puzzles to keep me entertained for a long time.
0553801473|1.0|Sadly, he's captured your imagination and is holding it hostage, dipping in your pockets to get more. He will write five more, and thousands of pages of irrelevant details before he says I am done with this story.<br />No way, pl. don't compare him with Tolkien who told a really good tale -- as neat and round as a ring, spun very effectively, and there were conclusions.<br />Here its a ramble. After five books and thousands of pages you get nothing. I just finished the fifth book, and it will be my last as I have managed to bring this long yarn \\"a long yawn\\" indeed to much needed conclusion in my own way \\"Dany wins the FIVE kingdoms, with the help of her dragons, and the bastard Jon, who is reunited with his step-family, Dany marries Jon and they live happily ever after..
0439023521|2.0|Average at best.  Not sure what all the excitement is.  There are many other bestsellers out there that deserve this attention.  To be fair, I'm probably not the target audience.
0307352145|2.0|Like most books of this genre, Cain's work suffers from a basic flaw: the topic makes a very interesting article of, say, twenty pages. Expanded into book-length, the topic falters and the author falls back on any kind of obliquely connected information she can find, and then proceeds to say the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />I enjoyed the early parts of this book, but found that the author descended fairly quickly into a cheerleader for the introverted way of life. As a half-introvert myself, I liked her cheers very much; but, after a while, I found her discussion laced with such tendentiousness, that it left me rather disappointed. Yet again, we have a pseudo-psychological study affirming the corruption of mainstream society and decrying the basic unfairness of life. Yes, indeed, life is wildly unfair, as is the structure of society itself. I do not think, though, that the masses of extroverts conspire to control the universe and keep down the introverted man. That's a far too easy claim, and I find Cain's relentless movement in that direction less a revolutionary cry for change and more an annoying whine about her own travails in the legal profession.<br /><br />This book has some solid points to make. I think, though, that many people have made the relevant points of this book many times before. If you must read it, take it out of the library, skim it or read a long-ish review. You'll get the salient points soon enough.
