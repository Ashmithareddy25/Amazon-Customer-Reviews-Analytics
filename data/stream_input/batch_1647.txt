B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun to play. you get to level up quickly. only wish you could earn more coins at a time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Not a big gamer? Don't have time to keep up a game? Want something to pass time while waiting in the morning commuter traffic? This is perfect for anyone and everyone! Great gameplay followed up by awesome graphics and simple controls, unbeatable for the price of free!<br /><br />* No star deduction.<br /><br />** I do recommend this application.<br /><br />*** Test device: Kindle Fire.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was a very fun game!  hidden object parts were challenging!  I highly recommend this game but not for little kids.  the story is a murder mystery.
0374139563|5.0|This book was incredible.  I am not very educated when it comes to economics, so at times I was slightly confused and had to do some rereading, but overall it was a great read.  She gives tons of examples (ex. Dongo) that helps clear up her points.  A must read for everyone!!!!!
B009B50QOU|5.0|If you want to get yourself moving on a sluggish day, you can't do better than this.  Fast, brash, yet melodic, the first four tunes are just what you expect from Green Day.  Unusual tracks include \\"Kill the DJ,\\" which has a reggae vibe, and \\"Troublemaker,\\" which borrows from REM's \\"Monster.\\"  But they're all classic Green Day.  If this is what the first 13 songs are like, I can't wait for \\"Dos!\\" and \\"Tre!\\"
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|I was a big fan of the Star Trek TV series and the message in this (a bit slow, but in the end worth it) movie did not disappoint.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This application was pre-installed on my Kindle Fire and I sure am glad! I have had no problems, no complaints, and no moment that I didn't know the weather!<br /><br />* No star deduction.<br /><br />** I do recommend this application.<br /><br />*** Test device: Kindle Fire.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|No instructions, which I actually found intriguing.  This game has a simple premise, but rapidly became quite difficult.  I enjoy puzzle games, and this one was quite good...with a nice little soundtrack as well.  I'd definitely buy it for a buck.  Don't be too lazy to expend a couple of brain cells on figuring out how to play this decent puzzle game.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great app! Problem with starting is annoying, but love the app. Would be 5 stars if not for the problem of starting or occasionally crashing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome totally. hells to the yes. this game is the shiznit fo show ha ha ha ha weee
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Sort of hard to read a book where the ending is known to all, and the author had been on a speaking tour providing many of the details in the book. Overall the book was well written and provides the reader a good understanding how challenging the job in special forces can be. The mission details for the attack on bin laden's compound were great, and still suspenseful even through we knew the outcome. Seemed like a quick read...
B0053O89WY|5.0|I really enjoy this series and Love getting each series as it becomes available and this is the best...awesome and funny.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Kindle Fire. Our 9yr old can't put this down (neither can Dad). When more levels are ready it would be 5 stars.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Loved every minute of this book. My husband is now reading it and he loves it too. And this was reviewed by Susan, not David. :-)
0143119680|3.0|So I initially picked up this book because someone I respect very much recommended it.  I'd never had book recommendations from them before, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad book.  It wasn't a good book.  It just was.  I pulled an all-nighter to finish reading it, but it didn't leave me with my head swirling with images, or with the fierce desire to draw the characters (for me, that's a surefire sign that I really enjoyed the book).<br /><br />I enjoyed the premise-- a magical book buried in the bowels of one of the oldest, largest libraries in the world acts as sort of a Holy Grail for the origins of all of the supernatural creatures in the world.  I liked that the protagonists were scholars.  And it showed-- Harkness was most comfortable and in her element when she was describing the scholarly and historical aspects of the story, and I found myself craving those flashes and glimpses of the text.  The pretend science was intriguing, but poorly thought out.  They have an extra chromosome!  An extra set of chromosomes!  No, biology doesn't work like that (but I am by training a biologist/biochemist, so perhaps I am a little harder on her than the average reader).<br /><br />On the other hand, the characters were uneven and out of place.  They felt like they belonged in a teenager's fantasy romance novel, unevenly imagined, and completely stock.  The girl who has ALL of the magical gifts, but refuses to use them.  The handsome, mysterious, all-knowing vampire who wants to sweep her up and protect her from everything.  There were attempts to break them out of the Mary-Sue/Gary-Stu mold, but they were weak and ineffectual.  Every new revelation about the character was poorly introduced, and felt incredibly out of the blue, as were the moments when Harkness tried for Matthew's point of view.  And I refuse to take any vampire who does yoga seriously.  It's almost as bad as Stephanie Meyer's sparkling emo atrocity.  I'm all for the updating of vampires, but please.  Let's do it in an intelligent, well-reasoned manner.<br /><br />It was enjoyable enough in the moment, but I didn't find myself craving to know more about Diana (and I already forgot her name, even though I just finished the book) and Matthew, so I probably won't read the sequel.  In the end, I just didn't care about the two perfect lovebirds separated by a contrivance, and though I was intrigued by Ashmole 782, it wasn't enough to overcome the non-feels I have for the one true pairing.<br /><br />I did, however, found myself wanting to read her scholarly writings.  She clearly loves her subject, and invests a great deal of care and thought in bringing it to life.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|love it.  cannot get enough. ha ha ha hahahahahaha hay Bahama Bah habha ha i ha ha ha ha ha
B008S80P38|3.0|Some of the songs are just weird for Deadmau5. The Veldt and Professional Griefers were the only great songs that bump and sounded good on Itunes when I previewed and bought them, not worth buying the whole CD. Some of the tracks are too mellow. Not as great compared to Sofie needs a ladder on his other CDs, etc.
B006TF6WAM|1.0|It is obvious that the Author never went for a walk in her life she must take the bus everywhere frankly she should have made some effort to experience what she was writing about
B007N9FKCY|5.0|We loved the game. Beat it getting everything possible. Some levels were hard, but not impossible. We got all the secrets in every level too, and did them in par jumps. Can't wait to see the next one!
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Having read the series of books, I was somewhat afraid that \\"Game of Thrones\\" would not live up to the books.  I was very pleasantly surprised, and greatly entertained by HBO's production.  The actors cast for the various characters could not have been better!  Kudos to HBO!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|my daughter and I have been playing this game nonstop. it is simple enough for a four year old; but sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy as well<br />!!! download it for you and your little one.
B006WJ0332|5.0|Good season, but too bad it is over.  It was good to see the different events that brought each character to their finality.
B0085MNZ66|1.0|This game will not work on Droid RAZR. when I try to open it I get a message stating that the game has stopped working.
B0080BFWE0|5.0|I received the movie the same day as was promised.  Packaging was intact, and now I have a delightful movie to enjoy.  A small note about the movie itself, sill delightfully fun.  Quality is on par for what I've seen from Blu-Ray, and the movie itself is light and fluffy, but still a ton of fun to watch.
B002APU580|5.0|If you are into sweet & romantic movies this is the movie to watch.<br />All.the Actors are awesome Performers.I have viewed it a vew times and i just love it
B008X8QCTO|5.0|Great game. Just be aware it is in reality a $1.99 game not $.99. no big deal. Still  a good value.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|it is the cools thing I ever sow I got it from my firemen on at school it was cool I and to have it
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I have the Grace for Drowning and the catalogue/preserve/amass live recording. Why would I need this? Because there seems to be no limit in the musicianship SW can extract from his band members. The only thing better is to see them live in addition to owning this BluRay disc. Six musicians - one master mind - a master piece.<br /><br />thank you Steven Wilson.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. I use it everyday. I'm addicted to pintrest. So many ideas. Especially love the pins for education. I'm always looking for new ideas and reinforcement  projects. I find tons on pintrest.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great plot. well written..I couldn't put the book down once i started it.  not my normal reading material  but worth reading.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was everything I was hoping for- an engaging story with rich, complex characters and all of the twists and turns that you want in a thriller.  I couldn't put it down!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I wasn't going to get this game because the graphics looked like it was a kids game. I downloaded the free version and I absolutely love this game. its a lot of fun and I like that it gets more challenging as you go along. I would recommend this to everyone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a must have for your mobile device or kindle fire... I hope you enjoy this one as much as I have... For a free app this is well worth your time
0061801313|1.0|DID NOT GET WHAT WAS PROMISED AND ONLY GOT ONE BOOK AND HAD TO SEND IT BACK AND GET A REFUND SO I GET NOTHING :( NOT A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|i don't use itune. The windows media player kept telling me i need to update after i put in the code.  I have the latest update already installed.  The digital downloads comes on a disk, why can't i just get off the disk?  The poster and comic is free but cost me shipping, why didn't it came included.  What I read from the other reviews, the digital download is in SD, therefore not even worth the hassle to report the code not working.  I'll just rip the blu-ray and transcode it myself to any format.  I would think the blu-ray should have more extra content.  Big disappointment!  The 4 disc bundle is worth no more than $20.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Was hesitant on getting this movie on blu ray. This great thriller is one of the better films by David Fincher (SEVEN wins the best) and Criterion has treated us to the best this dark movie has ever looked! This was always a hard film to transfer to home video and I was scared to risk getting another retread transfer. The first being the awesome Laserdisc from Criterion and the last on a horrible looking HD-DVD. I am glad I took the risk and upgraded to the Criterion blu ray. This is one fabulous looking visual feast. The detail in the dark picture is unbelievable. Have always been unable to see what is going on. Not anymore. I don't know how Criterion did it, but you can see in the darkness without the blacks looking gray. And they tweaked the color where the Polygram DVD looked golden colored. Just make sure you watch this in a dimly lit room because most of this movie is dark. It is presented in its original 2.35 Super 35 widescreen format. With two soundtracks in DTS-HD. The \\"newest\\" being an alternate 5.1 optimized for home theater. Looks like most of the special features are carried over from Criterion's Laserdisc (like the commentary), except for this fantastic looking transfer and this wonderful newer soundtrack. I can't say it enough: upgrade to the blu ray if you are a fan of this thriller. I realize it is costly, but with Criterion you shouldn't be disappointed.<br />Just wished Criterion would get the rights to release SEVEN on blu ray. Their Laserdisc was awesome back in the day and the Warner blu ray can't touch the brilliance that Criterion brought to that dark movie.<br />Criterion has always done the darker David Fincher films right.
B004I744AS|5.0|this is an great app! you can type in almost any English word and it will automatically give you the full definition! I would highly recomend this app!
B000VOC90Y|2.0|The Ibex 17in notebook backpackers would of been perfect for my son to use to take his laptop to classes if the zipper on the laptop section had not failed after only two days.  I could not take a chance and get the same backpack to replace the broken one.  I looked everywere for a backpacks with metal zippers.  I found one,  but all the reviews said the stitching failed in the seams.  I guess if they make something too good I won 't be spending money to constantly replacing quickly worn out products.  Being put in this position all the time is getting to me.  It has been a long time since I have purchased anything that seemed well constructed over all aspects of the product.  Oh well,  in summery if the zippers were good heavy duty ones this backback would of been perfect and I would be singing praises all over the place.  So sorry I couldn't do that.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day is an accounting of the daily preparation and challenges of the US Navy SEALS as they put themselves in harm's way in defense of our country.  The book is written from the story teller's personal experience and perspective. Recommend this read to anyone interested in knowing how brave our soldiers really are as they put their lives on the line.
B0098VXN2Y|2.0|There are too many story lines going on in this movie. I found it boring and annoying to watch. I hoped the superstar cast meant it was going to be good but I was very wrong! There were moments of comedy that kept md from rating this a meager 1 star but not enough to keep me interested.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was so excited to read another J.K. Rowling. H.P. was a classic. But I was SEVERELY disappointed. so much foul language, SO much explicit filth. A good writer can use allusion without searing images of crass drivel being poured onto the page. I bought the kindle edition and could only make it to 13% before I had to put it away. I was sick to my stomache. I truly hope Rowling will return to something else next time, even if its not Harry. I feel like she was trying to move out of the pigeon-hole YA genre and went over the cliff in the opposite direction.<br /><br />THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU CAN RETURN THE KINDLE EDITION WITHIN 7 DAYS OF PURCHASE!!! I CHOSE OFFENSIVE CONTENT AS MY REASON FOR RETURN.
B00957T6X6|1.0|Once again the Publisher and Amazon have collided to price fix this set at higher than mass market paperback price.  Are they determined to kill eBooks?<br />They still have not been able to put in page numbers, or size graphics.  You will be much happier with the papaerback edition., and save money as well.
0316228532|5.0|I'm a huge HP fan and was terrified I wouldn't like this new book, but I absolutely loved it. It goes without saying that this is not a children's book. This is not Harry Potter. This book is just real.<br />Rowling doesn't hold back and isn't afraid of taboo subjects. Her characters are real and small town.<br />I think Rowling really stepped up to the plate and smashed this one out of the park.
B005P9SLES|5.0|This TV show is amazing that is all I have to say. Great scenery and awesome story line to go with a historic TV franchise.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|... a bit slowly for my hunger of this story xD<br />It's amazing how you end up rooting for all the characters (some more than others, obviously)<br />Aren't all perspective right no matter how opposed they may stand?
B0076YMJI4|5.0|\\"Back and Forth\\" looks back at the career of the Foo Fighters from the last days of Nirvana to the release of the \\"Wasting Light\\" album.  All members of the Foo Fighters (past and present) provide commentary on the ups and downs of the band.  Dave Grohl discusses the death of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to recording the first Foo Fighters album by himself in about 5 days and then turning down an offer to become the new drummer for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  Grohl and the rest of the band then discuss how the rest of the band came together with various comings and goings until the band settled into a permanent line-up, which came close to disolving during the recording of the \\"One by One\\" album.  From that point, they take you through their rise in popularity all the way to their two sold out shows at Wembley Stadium in 2008.  The final half hour looks at the making of their \\"Wasting Light\\" album, which was recorded at Dave Grohl's home.  \\"Wasting Light\\" also marked Grohl's reunions with producer Butch Vig, who produced Nirvana's classic \\"Nevermind\\" album, as well as Nirvana bass player Krist Novoselic, who appears in the song \\"I Should Have Known\\".  The documentary ends off with an album release party at the Roxy in LA.<br /><br />A must for any Foo Fighters fan.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The three Hunger Games books are really phenomenal -- so well written, keeps you on edge throughout and each tells a fantastic story.  This final book in the trilogy more than lived up to expectations.

0785135863|5.0|I've read each book in this series and they all flow together which is nice.  It's almost as if the author wrote them all and then found places to end one book and start the other.  This makes for a nice flow between characters when they speak to each other.  It's also nice because it doesn't take 50 or 100 pages to get into a new book... it is simply a continuation of the previous book....<br /><br />I'm not sure there will be any more in this series after his last one, which is sad, but... a good series.  Young adults I'm sure would love these!  I as a full adult sure did.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I LOVE this book!!!!!  Life changing!!!!  Not only for marriages but for all relationships. Incredibly changed my relationship with my mother, I finally understand her!!!  I can finally do things for her that will matter to her on a deeper level!!!  I recommend this to all my friends.  This along with The Love Dare is the wedding gift I get for all weddings I get invited to!  A must have!  You will not regret this read!

B008Y2IU12|5.0|This is a great retelling of a classic story, having a darker story line with SnowWhite being the hero. I would recommend this movie if you like fairytales and fantasy type of movies.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|Perfect little speed light. Wasn't sure about this product before ordering, given the price and that it is the cheapest of the Nikon Speedlights. But my other options were purchasing a product that I couldn't afford, or trying to use a 30+ year old one, and praying that its compatible with my D3000 and doesn't fry anything. That being said this product is amazing.<br /><br />Flash is super bright, and being able to angle the flash has been an extremely helpful feature. Batteries last forever in it, I carry 1 set of spares because I know if they die on me, that other set is all I need to keep going for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Overall this is a great little product for the price, I know it lacks alot of features vs more expensive flashes, but for what you pay for, its 10x better than the build in flash.
B007SGM084|5.0|I ordered this bundle after getting the first book from my library. I hadn't even finished reading the first book before I just had to buy all three. I love these books! And the convenience of having them on my Kindle, so that I can take them with me and read whenever/wherever I want is great! I thought the price was really good, as well.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is very enjoyable! Its a fun way to kill time. Its fun to play for the goals! however some of the item's are overpriced.
B001OMJGD0|2.0|I watched this movie when it came out and was really thrilled to see it.  I had heard that the guy playing Superman might be a good fit.  He certainly had the look and after watching it, he nailed Christopher Reeve's performance well enough, but he brought nothing else other than cribbing/paying homage to Reeve.<br /><br />The Lois Lane actress was absolutely awful.  Even the Smallville Lois Lane actress got the role right in comparison.  Spacey was great as Lex Luthor: a sophisticated, diabolical genius.  Classic Lex and not nearly as campy as Gene Hackman was.<br /><br />Now to the point of my title: Superman spent the entire movie stalking Lois Lane.  He did not feel majestic, or inspiring, but yet creepy and a tad perverted.  By the end of the movie it becomes obvious, to some extent, why he was stalking Lois, but just because they had a love child does not mean it makes it right.  Supes could have just done an X-Ray vision check and discovered the boy shared similar DNA, but instead Superman just stalks Lois.  Heck, to top it off  Superman is a dead-beat-dad!  What, leaving for 5 years and only coming back because his check of Krypton went poorly, and then discovering he bailed on Lois when she was with child.  Another case of: check that Lois isn't pregnant after their rendezvous by using X-Ray vision on her.  All these facts aside, I also imagined that Superman would have married Lois if he was going to become intimate with her, but no, true to popular cultures view of men, he bails after he has his fun.  He sure is swell!  This point and Kevin Spacey are the two things I remember most strongly about this film and thus ruined the experience for me (Spacey's performance being the only true saving grace).  My point is that this is not Superman by any means.  A womanizer, a dead-beat-dad, and a stalker aren't Superman!  Why doesn't anyone see this?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!<br /><br />There were other problems with the film as well, but I could care less.  I am thankful they canned this part of the Superman mythos and are starting again (although I have severe reservations on this as well).<br /><br />In the end this movie is incredibly forgetable and disappointing.  As others have said in other reviews, this was just a homage to the Christopher Reeve Superman's and really just tried to capture the feel of the originals, but failed.  If there hadn't been the Dark Knight Trilogy I would suggest that Warner Bros give up on creating super hero films and just leave it to Marvel to do it right.

B001D1SRRS|5.0|It's an incredibly interesting read. As a senior university Mechanical Engineering student, I highly recommend Machine to any other young engineer or engineering student.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|For me, not Ana. Horribly written and monotonous. Maybe could have been one good book. Feel the author repeated the same conversations just to stretch the story out... \\"You're leaving\\", \\"I won't leave you\\", I thought you were leaving\\", please don't leave\\". Over and over and over. Do not recommend.
0316228532|5.0|i have to say, i was completely taken aback by the number of negative reviews of this book. when i read them, however, it was clear to see that many of the people doling out a single star did not even finish it, and many more were essentially disappointed they were not reading another harry potter book.<br /><br />this book admittedly has a somewhat slow start-- there are a lot of characters and rowling spends a good deal of time introducing them. however, every word describing them is necessary in establishing a rich back story that sets up the rest of the novel. many people complained about the number of characters and the slow start in their one star reviews, but i read the book off and on over a few days and had no trouble remembering each of the characters. perhaps if you have a short attention span or a bad memory, this book is not for you.<br /><br />another complaint was that none of the characters were likable, and this almost had me laughing. while it makes sense for a book meant for children and young adults to have a hero that was almost always morally good, the characters in this book are more true to life-- they are both good and bad; they struggle with morality and its place in their lives much in the same way that real people do. not being able to connect to any of the characters is a complaint i cannot even begin to understand-- if you have ever felt loss, experienced unrequited love, or questioned your self worth, you should have no problem connecting to the characters. i can only assume that the people that wrote those reviews have a complete lack of empathy.<br /><br />many people also disparaged the use of bad language and sexual content. when it was announced that rowling was writing a book for adults, i assumed that meant that it would have adult content, so i am not sure why people were surprised or shocked by this. *SPOILER* some people described the sexual content as \\"gratuitous\\", but considering some of the characters were teenage boys and some were victims of sexual abuse, i find this somewhat naive and misguided. if you are looking for a book that glosses over the facts of life, this book is not for you.<br /><br />this novel tells the story of a small town, and the intersecting lives of its residents. rowling created not only a few, but several nuanced, complex relationships in the way that only she can. i found it beautifully and carefully written, each word deliberate and necessary. it didn't have the typical storybook ending, which i absolutely loved. i closed the book feeling totally satisfied with the way she neatly ended the story.<br /><br />if you approach this story in the context of harry potter, you might be disappointed. if you are interested in hearing a new story from an incredible author and you can manage not to color your expectations with memories of her past works, i think you'll enjoy it.some were victims of sexual abuse, i find this somewhat naive and misguided. if you are looking for a book that glosses over the facts of life, this book is not for you.<br /><br />this novel tells the story of a small town, and the intersecting lives of its residents. rowling created not only a few, but several nuanced, complex relationships in the way that only she can. i found it beautifully and carefully written, each word deliberate and necessary. it didn't have the typical storybook ending, which i absolutely loved. i closed the book feeling totally satisfied with the way she neatly ended the story.<br /><br />if you approach this story in the context of harry potter, you might be disappointed. if you are interested in hearing a new story from an incredible author and you can manage not to color your expectations with memories of her past works, i think you'll enjoy it.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the fifty shades trilogy! The last book always left me wanting more! It's a definite read for anyone who needs a little extra umph in their lives!!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I was desperate for book to pass the time on a recent trip so I grabbed this one on lark.  It didn't quite do the job keeping me amused:  the mix of science, history, modern themes, and masonic conspiracies was weak and ultimately predictable.  I found myself quickly skimming through large passages - especially at the end - as the reader is awkwardly forced to endure yet another lecture on symbology, Christianity, the laughable \\"science\\" of noetics, and/or masonic history.<br /><br />I've never really enjoyed the \\"National Treasure\\" movies with Nick Cage, but they were a tad more entertaining than this disappointing novel.
0984183523|5.0|This is a fantastic guide and a definite MUST HAVE for all case interview candidates. It is easy to read, practical and well structured and presented. Don't waste your time on any other material - this is by far the best. Victor Cheng is clearly a leader in this field, and his dedication in helping candidates is evident in this book as well as the free material and resources available from his website.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is a perfect ending to The Fifty Shades trilogy. This was a great series and it could not have ended better. Can't wait for the movies!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I don't regret buying it, the first two books were amazing and it's a very good series altogether, I just really disliked how rushed this last book was. Looked to me like it was a book written to have a movie made out of it instead of a book written for the actual readers. The ending could certainly have been improved.

B0085MNZ66|5.0|I have nothing but props for the developer for putting out a puzzle game that is actually challenging and requires actual brain cells to be able to play. I can only help but laugh at those who think that a PUZZLE game should hold their hand through it. That's hilarious to me. I am into solving the harder puzzle games and playing adventure games and especially original text adventures (also called interactive fiction). And the harder the game is... the more I like to play it. I just love exercising my brain that way. Back in the day, there were no instructions whatsoever and that was part of the charm. Even in text adventures just figuring out the vocabulary that the game understood or worked with was also part of the experience. Nothing was handed to you. To the developer: it is not your fault nor is it mine that some people simply can't think that way through problems and solve them without a crutch. lt never ceases to amaze me me how people nowadays are so often unwilling to work for anything or apply their mental resources (assuming they have dome, of course ;) in trying to figure out the solution to any particular problem(s) that they face. The way that you designed this game is pure genius and I have to tell you that I am enjoying it immensely. Thank you so much! I love exercising my brain this way and it is very hard to find modern games that don't treat me like an idiot. Thank you.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|What an amazing movie! I actually watched it twice just to make sure I saw everything! Gandhi did so much and this movie really was wonderful to share what he did with the world! After watching this movie I did a little research on Gandhi. The movie did and exceptional job putting everything he did into the big screen.<br />M. Gandhi starts out as a young Indian attorney at law traveling in South Africa when thrown off the train he becomes angry that his people are not being treated equally, especially since he was an attorney and very well educated. His people were being treated unequally due to the color of their skin (dark skinned). He started these meetings with the Indians of South Africa and formed groups that would stand in protest against these laws of the white man. During one protest the white men charged them on horses and Gandhi and his men layed down so the horses were scared and would not trample them! That was amazing and I could see then that they were not scared of anything and would do anything to keep fighting for their equal rights. They stood strong but Gandhi's rules were not to harm these men especially kill them no matter what they did to them or how they were treated they had to stay strong and above them. Gandhi even started a village where people would live and their would be no one who was above another. His wife was actually mad she had to clean the toilets, but Gandhi said it was what was right becaus no one is more important than another! The end is very sad and I will not spoil the rest of the movie for you! But really watch and you will learn of this magnificant world leader, GANDHI!
B001NLL8LA|1.0|I have read most of Lee  Child 'S Jack Reacher  novels. In the past I have found them enjoyable and although not the most interesting of the genre ,certainly one of the more consistent in holding my interest.<br /><br />Gone Tomorrow was by far his worse novel.I found it difficult to believe Mr. Child had written it. After about forty percent of the book I stopped reading it.I am sure  the author will bounce back with a better novel in the future .
B0061Q13V2|5.0|I grew up watching Dominique moceanu and the magnificent seven doing gymnastics on tv as a tween. It was very interesting to get a look at what it was really like for her, including the ugly side of competing at that level. I had no idea...
B006H5120E|2.0|I have seen DVD with 2D to 3D conversion.<br />I have seen blu-ray with 2D to 3D conversion<br /><br />I feel that blu-ray players with 2D to 3D conversion did better job. They were consistent during whole feature film.<br /><br />In 3D movie, I feel many places cheap tricks used to convert 2D movie to 3D movie and DIFFERENT tricks, although the film producer might paid a lot money for that. The DIFFERENT tricks made the film looking horrible to me. I've very good 3D perception.<br /><br />For this movie, I'll prefer DVD or blu-ray with 2D to 3D conversion next time.<br />Studio conversion of 2D to 3D is quite expensive, it used to be about $100,000 per minute. Sorry to say, I don't find it worth - it is OK for collection, not for viewing. The blu ray player 2D to 3D converters are doing consistent job giving better view.<br /><br />In comparison to 3D movies like \\"How to train your DRAGON\\", I'd give 3D version of Titanic just 3 out of 10. The 2D stands at 10/10.
B0068MNO4S|4.0|I first learned about this controversy after reading an article by essayist and editor Joseph Sobran in National Review (NR) in 1991. Suddenly many murky questions I had about William Shakespeare became very clear. The real author of his plays, Sobran claimed, was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, a very learned man and a literary scholar but whose authorship of those plays was not acceptable for a man of his rank. Rhys Ifans is magnificent in his role as the Earl of Oxford.<br /><br />The veracity and revisionism of the Sobran article was answered in a subsequent NR issue by none other than Charlton Heston, who vigorously defended Shakespeare and the accepted conventional historical account.<br /><br />The movie is magnificently made, the acting and cast superb, the setting (e.g. the Globe Theater, circa 1600 London, etc.) and cinematography outstanding, but the historical additions and elaborations, interwoven with pompous fictional exuberance, detract from the more serious literary debate. So I for one was disappointed for example when as someone else wrote Queen Elizabeth I was transformed in the film from the austere, dignified Tudor Virgin Queen, who placed the throne and England above everything else, to a young, fluttering nymphomaniac monarch butterfly and later to a befuddled old hag of a queen.<br /><br />In those days of the Renaissance when monarchs had no real private lives, Queen Elizabeth I could not have been another Catherine the Great without the court and courtiers knowing of her sexual liaisons and gossipy peccadilloes, nor could she have prevented these transgressions from seeping into the fabric of historical accounts.<br /><br />Likewise, the character of William Shakespeare, the literary wraith, is needlessly distorted beyond belief for the purpose of contrast and the sensationalization of the film.<br /><br />The elaboration and interweaving of fictitious events leading to the Earl of Oxford as one of the former lovers of the queen and whose sexual consummation led to the bastardy of the Earl of Southampton also adds to our sense of disbelief.<br /><br />I recommend a little homework for those who seek historical accuracy before watching this movie. Look up the main historical characters and learn a bit about them, i.e., Queen Elizabeth; the Earls of Essex and Southampton; William Cecil and Robert Cecil, his son; Ben Jonson; and of course the Earl of Oxford and William Shakespeare.<br /><br />If one watches this movie with a sense for historical accuracy, not to mention if seeking clarification as to the dispute of who actually wrote the Shakespearean plays -- the film is disappointing. Admirers of Queen Betsy will be enraged. Ben Jonson fans will be delighted. Those seeking historical entertainment and those who enjoy alternative history for its sake - will be entertained. Those who watch historical films to learn history and use that \\"history\\" for conversational purposes will be deceived, and will be unwitting deceivers to others, unless they are careful historical connoisseurs, who can separate very carefully the wheat from the chaff in this fictionalized historical movie!<br /><br />Dr. Miguel A.

0679422714|5.0|The book is so well written that you don't want to put it down. One of the most engaging aspects of the writing style is how the author uses the recollections and commentaries of people from later years to add meaning to the particular part of the chronology she is telling.  One example is Mao's 1936 mention of his first wife to an American journalist, the only time he ever spoke of her.  This certainly adds a deeper dimension to the telling of the story of Mao's 1908 marriage to this poor woman he never loved.  (She died a little over a year after they were married.)  So, if you are worried that a book of more than 800 pages will not hold your interest, have no fear.  As for all those pages, the Epilogue is on page 631.  More than 170 pages are devoted to names of interviewees, notes, bibliographies and indices.  There are also frequent footnotes and annotations within the text itself.  It is obviously a very well-researched book.

0345349571|4.0|I read this book when it first appeared in 1978, and recently re-read it after I obtained a nice first edition at a library sale. I thought it was a great read when it first appeared in my teenage years, and now after so many years, it still holds my attention with its lively pace and interesting anecdotes. I bought and read Froissart's Chronicles and Huizinga's Waning of the Middle Ages years ago because of interest stimulated by A Distant Mirror. The delineation of broader events by loose connection to DeCoucy's personal history is an interesting approach, no matter what you may think of him. The main problem with the book, as I see it, is the title which implies that the Western world of 1978 was somehow facing calamities and threats similar to those faced by Europeans of 1378. It was just not true. Aside from the perennial similarities in the human condition, the two societies had entirely different social structures, organization, understandings and outlooks. In the fourteenth century institutions like the Catholic Church maintained a consistent cultural integrity, even in this period of psychic and material disasters and widespread moral debasement, while in our day there is cultural disintegration, fluid moral standards and only realtively minor material troubles which we are in a better condition to deal with. Calamities on the order of Vietnam, high unemployment and the Oil Shocks just don't have the same gravity and extent as the Hundred Years War and the Black Death. I suppose, however, we suffer from a similar lack of confidence in the future. The book would not have been a success if Tuchman had tried to explain at length why the 14th century is a mirror for us. Still, this is a fine book although here and there it is diffuse, as it attempts to provide a panorama. I believe a few of Tuchman's books (Proud Tower, Stillman) will continue to pass the test of time, this is one of them.

B0083VFEMW|5.0|Unlike some of the more self-important reviewers who have reviewed this album, I don't think that an album's overall theme is that critical, particularly in this day and age, when we can pick and choose singles to buy rather than albums.  Bottom line: I love the variety of these songs.  The upbeat tunes are fantastic.  \\"Let's Have a Kiki\\", \\"Keep Your Shoes\\", and \\"Shady Love\\" are all retro and hilarious and fun.  \\"San Luis Obispo\\" and \\"Secret Life of Letters\\" had to grow on me, but now I like them as well.  This is my favorite album since their debut album.  Give it a chance!

B009DP9D6A|4.0|The album is not as poor as some of the reviews would make it out to be.  Sure, the continual flow from \\"Random Album Title\\" is non-existent, but songs like \\"Closer,\\" \\"Fn Pig,\\" and the ingenious \\"There Might Be Coffee\\" are structured much in the same vein as the aforementioned album.  Of course, you've already heard \\"Professional Griefers,\\" which in my opinion is a great song, even with the addition of vocals.  Look...deadmau5 is obviously now more popular than ever and open to all sorts of scrutiny, but at the end of the day -- as a PRODUCER -- he is a master of his craft.  I do not, however, blame anyone who shall discontinue listening after \\"October,\\" simply because for me, the album stops there.  Many of the negative reviews make note of the oddly-placed Cypress Hill collaboration, \\"Failbait,\\" and I will admit, it is quite random.  I won't necessarily say that it is a bad song, but it serves as more of a throwaway bonus track than anything...as does \\"Sleepless\\" and \\"Telemiscommunications.\\"  Take the first ten tracks in as an album by itself and it'll become clear that this is indeed a deadmau5 record.  The buildups, transitions, and climaxes are all there, but temper your expectations.  This is nothing new or ground-breaking, yet serves as a more-than-satisfactory album in a world of increasingly-muddled and generic EDM...<br /><br />1) Superliminal:  4/5.  Nice intro/kick in the head.  Similar to \\"FML.\\"<br /><br />2) Channel 42: 4/5.  Solid material here.  Similar to \\"Hi Friend\\" and \\"Moar Ghosts.\\"<br /><br />3) The Veldt: 3.5/5.  Somewhat similar to \\"I Remember,\\" but not really.  Just a really chill tune.<br /><br />4) Fn Pig:  4.5/5.  Similar to \\"Bad Selection,\\" but the intro/various sound effects are quite reminiscent of the Megaman video game franchise...lol.<br /><br />5) Professional Griefers:  4.5/5.  Of course, you know this one.  Similar to \\"Sofi Needs a Ladder.\\"<br /><br />6) Maths:  3.5/5.  Catchy tune, but different.  Difficult to compare to previous work...actually somewhat similar to Justice's \\"Phantom.\\"<br /><br />7) There Might Be Coffee:  5/5.  Far and away, the best song on the album and a career top-10 landmark track.  Again, some nostalgic Megaman-ish sounds throughout...but damn, do they fit (seriously, Google Megaman if you are confused).  Similar to \\"Aural Synapse\\" and dare I say it, \\"Strobe.\\"  Yeah...I cannot stress this enough...it is THAT good.<br /><br />8) Take Care of the Proper Paperwork:  3/5.  Meh...this one isn't bad, but serves more as a transition between the two marvels that sandwich it.  Sounds like a collaboration that might have occurred between NIN and Prodigy...though an actual collaboration of that magnitude might make this very song shrivel up and die of humiliation.<br /><br />9) Closer:  5/5.  The other gem of the album.  What starts off like a \\"red yellow green blue green\\" SIMON sound effect (which might also be recognized from the \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" film), quickly sweeps you far away to a random Asian paradise...simply masterful.  There are certainly some elements uncannily reminiscent to \\"Slip,\\" yet the track climaxes nicely into something akin to \\"Not Exactly.\\"<br /><br />10) October: 4/5.  Good tune...but not necessarily great (just wished it climaxed into something greater).  However, it is the last TRUE piece of what deserves to constitute as one cohesive album.  Similar to \\"HR 8938 Cephei.\\"<br /><br />I won't even go into tracks 11-13 because as I have already mentioned, I don't quite consider them part of the album, but instead as simple \\"bonus tracks.\\"  Go into the album expecting some great building tracks that you've come to expect from \\"The Mau5\\" and disregard most of the negative feedback.  Give it a few spins and judge for yourself...work...actually somewhat similar to Justice's \\"Phantom.\\"<br /><br />7) There Might Be Coffee:  5/5.

B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome trilogy. Keeps you on your toes from beginning to end. Couldn't stop reading! Very good, strongly recommend it. I loved it
159420411X|2.0|This book was a disappointment for me, and I feel that the time I spent reading it has been mostly wasted. I will first, however, describe what I thought is *good* about the book. Everything in this book is very clear and understandable. As for the content, I think that the idea of Baysean thinking is interesting and sound. The idea is that, whenever making any hypothesis (e.g. a positive mammogram is indicative of breast cancer) into a prediction (for example, that a particular woman with a positive mammogram actually has cancer), one must not forget to estimate all the following three pieces of information:<br /><br />1. The general prevalence of breast cancer in population. (This is often called the \\"prior\\": how likely did you think it was that the woman had cancer before you saw the mammogram)<br /><br />2. The chance of getting a positive mammogram for a woman with cancer.<br /><br />3. The chance of getting a positive mammogram for a woman without cancer.<br /><br />People often tend to ignore items 1 and 3 on the list, leading to very erroneous conclusions. \\"Bayes rule\\" is simply a mathematical gadget to combine these three pieces of information and output the prediction (the chance that the particular woman with a positive mammogram has cancer). There is a very detailed explanation of this online (search Google for \\"yudkowsky on bayes rule\\"), no worse (if more technical) than the one in the book. If you'd like a less technical description, read chapter 8 of the book (but ignore the rest of it).<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Now for the *bad*. While the Baysean idea is valuable, its description would fit in a dozen of pages, and it is certainly insufficient by itself to make good predictions about the real world. I had hoped that the book would draw on the author's experience and give an insight into how to apply this idea in the real world. It does the former, but not he latter. There are lots of examples and stories (sometimes amusing; I liked the Chess story in Chapter 9), but the stories lead the reader to few insights.<br /><br />The examples only lead to one conclusion clearly. If you need to be convinced that \\"the art of making predictions is important, but it is easy to get wrong\\", read this book. If you wonder: \\"how can we actually make good predictions?\\", don't. The only answers provided are useless platitudes: for example, \\"it would be foolish to ignore the commonly accepted opinion of the community, but one must also be careful to not get carried away by herd mentality\\". While I was searching for the words to describe the book, I have found the perfect description in Chapter 12 the book itself:<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />Heuristics like Occam's razor ... sound sexy, but they are hard to apply.... An admonition like \\"The more complex you make the model the worse the forecast gets\\" is equivalent to saying \\"Never add too much salt to the recipe\\".... If you want to get good at forecasting, you'll need to immerse yourself in the craft and trust your own taste-buds.<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />Had this quote been from the introduction, and had the book given any insight into how to get beyond the platitudes, it would be the book I hoped to read. However, the quote is from the penultimate chapter, and there is no further insight inside this book.<br /><br />P.S. I first posted this review at Goodreads, and any updates will happen there and not here. Amazon has destroyed all the formatting and the hyperlink in this review, so the version at Goodreads is slightly better already.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is an excellent game. It is beautifully rendered and the puzzles can be quite challenging. I've enjoyed it so much I also bought the sequel.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|I was curious about the mixed reviews for this game so I decided to try it.  I was intrigued by the simplicity of this game.  It is a fun and challenging little puzzle app.  I was a bit skeptical before downloading it based on the simplicity of the graphics and gameplay descriptions, but this game is actually pretty charming.  It is a bit challenging and requires some real thought to figure out how to order everything.  Overall, I think its a pretty fun little game that is better than many other FAOTD and 99 cent apps I've seen lately.  It does have some flaws including the issues on some phones and the difficulty in accessing the back button on the Fire (which is the device I played this on), as well as the lack of instructions.  I like that the developer has replied to customers about the problems, though I don't think responding via a 5-star review was the right way.  A nice game from a small developer, definitely worth keeping an eye on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it! Great ending to the trilogy. No sugar coating just plain and raw. Well done! Still room for a fourth book!
B0075PYG1M|5.0|I first heard \\"Gonna Be Alright\\" from a fellow musician. It was real hip, so I purchased the whole CD. Man, I was blown away! It's so cool to hear fresh, new music. All of this \\"smooth jazz\\" stuff is okay, but it's getting redundant. It's time for someone to bring something different to our ears. Joe Zawinul (Weather Report) wrote a song titled \\"Can It Be Done\\" asking \\"is there one melody that's never been in the air?\\" I wish \\"The Robert Glasper Experiment\\" is the one he could've heard. I met robert Glasper at the Indy Jazz fest last month and He's really a nice guy. Keep up the good works!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I really think how much you enjoy this movie will depend on how you like the style.  It strikes me as rather art housey, which is interesting for a major release.  It gets very stylized at times with the exposition.<br /><br />I haven't read the books, but my wife indicated that there are a number of character changes, and that some rather important items from the first book are left out.  We also wonder how they will be able to stretch out the last two books into three movies.<br /><br />It's an OK movie from my viewpoint as someone who's never read it - she was a bit more disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the app more than using the mobile web page. Thanks for creating this and for making it easy to use.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well done, strong raw and naked! Lots of imagination, very credible though unpredictable. I was happy with the second book. Exceeded my expectations
0446604844|5.0|Some authors build a franchise around characters and some build franchises about their own writing. The second is the case with David Baldacci. While I enjoy the return of familiar characters I also enjoy the ability for an author to build fresh new ones whenever the story calls for it. No baggage, no conflicts of previous storylines.... This story is very fresh and very exciting.
0316228532|5.0|It did take me a bit of time to get into this book, mostly because of who the author is and how different the characters are  from the beloved Harry Potter.  But at some point, not sure when, I got so absorbed in the story  I forgot who wrote it. The characters are so finely drawn, so real, the story going towards an inevitable end, almost like watching an accident about to happen when you can do nothing about it. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />As to the bizarre low rating, all the complaints about price, this is priced no different then any other new book that comes out  in hard cover. Do any of those who complained even own a kindle? do they ever get hard cover new releases?  Our is it just a bunch of people wanting to rqerrtw this particular author low for some reason?
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey grabbed my interest from the start, but later became a bit monotonous and predictable. However, I did purchase the second book of the Trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker, and will continue with the series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is such an exciting book.  I found out about it from the TV series, and just had to have the details of the book.  It made it better that I had faces to go with the names.  I am not sure our civilizations have gotten much better than this brutal lifestyle, and with that, the courage of the men and women that survived it...even for a time.  Enjoy.  Never a dull moment.
0440246008|5.0|I enjoy the ability of Lee Child to continually up the ante with the story lines revolving around Jack Reacher. Action, suspense and pain, plenty of pain for those that cross the loner. I enjoy his every effort in trying to right the wrong and terminate the bad. What could be next, Reacher on a cruise ship? Stand by!
B0085MNZ66|2.0|having no directions for a puzzle game sucks. even worse when the developed refuses to give any's help. didn't take long for me to be stuck after I tried a ton of ways. then I just got bored. there are too many interesting games with clear instructions for me to waste my time on this one.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Jack Reacher is on the road again! Lee Child is better than ever before; descriptive, precise, accurate and the tension is building. Written like a screenplay but please do not use Tom Cruise.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app its easy to use, tells you your battery percentage and even has a notification. I also like it because you can change the battery color.... Fun!
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I stepped off the normal sure-thing author wagon again on the chance that I might discover a new fresh storyteller and with Dan Brown I was not disappointed. A story involving satellites, the military and top secret stuff always gets my nod as the foundation for a great read. I can report that it was a good read and I will keep the author on my go to list....
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game looks amazing, as it's based on the much better ps3 counterpart Rayman Origins. He runs automatically and you control the actions, or inactions, required to get all the points. This seems like the best possible way to do an old school gaming experience without a controller though, making it a welcome diversion between classes.

B001HBYHFA|4.0|Serenity concludes and wraps up of most of the story lines from the show Firefly.  It also explains some of the premises the show was based on.  If you are a fan of the show, as I am, you will like this, but it could have been a little more inclusive, as Ron Glass's Preacher is never completely explained.  There is a hook at the end for a sequel.  It has the same feel and action in a longer format, so more development of plot and characters are possible.  The added discs provide even more insight and behind-the-scenes looks. This is a must have, if you have the Firefly series. Overall, I still want more Nathan, so I watch Castle for my fix and almost anything the other actors are in.  Enjoy.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|When time allows and I have room on my reading list I can always go to a David Baldacci book for solid reading entertainment. In Split Second he continues to serve up a reader's treat. I rank Baldacci right up there with Lee Child, Tim Dorsey and Randy Wayne White.

B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley is sort of a falsetto Jim Morrison.  His voice has a haunting quality that is bigger than his songs.  He's definitely channeling something deeper than just the lyrics.  Some musicians say that his version of the Lenard Cohen song Hallelujah is the most perfectly recorded song ever.  I think what they're talking about is that he \\"gets\\" the song - his interpretation is accurate and the darkness of the lyrics is emoted through what is probably his own personal pain.  It's this kind of soulfulness that makes him stand out.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|I liked this film more until this gang supposedly breaks out a retired battleship complete w/ its 85 year old retired crew and loads it full of ammo in the blink of an eye. Then it proceeds to out duel a vastly superior alien ship. Oh and the Robo Cop Alien fight w/ the legless fat black dude in a t-shirt & shorts was a complete joke as well...worth a rental I guess. Not believable...but it is good action entertainment. Surprised it isn't rated PG as the violence is very light & clean, if you will.<br /><br />Robyn Fenty (aka Rihanna) looks hot dripping wet
B005KELQEU|4.0|I bought this along with Kindle 4, so the shipping cost is waived for this sleeve. There is always confusion among Kindle owners whether go for cover or sleeve. To keep it simple, if you want weightless option and ok to pop in and out everytime, then sleeves does the job well. The covers on the other hand add 100 grams to overall Kindle weight of 170g and since I bought this Kindle for my father, i felt it will be uncomfortable to carry 100g extra in a hand every time he reads. New Amazon cover will cost around $40. Remember you can get 'Used - Like New' cover for same price as this sleeve. So price isn't a factor. By the way i feel using this sleeve with just the longer side zip open, with other 3 sides closed. This is more easier than to unzip two sides. One small issue i felt is the Belkin logo in the front should have been reverse. Everytime i pick it, this misleads me to pick the wrong side of the cover.
0345541588|5.0|In \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" Lee Child comes up with yet another twist on putting Jack Reacher in the middle of a lose-lose situation and somehow, he crafts a believable way out for our favorite drifter. After reading \\"Die Trying\\" I instantly became hooked on the Jack Reacher series. You would expect that after a dozen books in the series Child would run out of plausable situations for Reacher to fall into and the plot line would become predictable....well you would think wrong. I look forward to reading \\"Worth Dying For\\" and \\"The Affair\\" Child's newest in the series. Now if they could have only gotten Mike Rowe from the Ford car commercials to play reacher instead of Tom Cruise.....
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I got this to allow me to use my Kindle and watch programs on my Dish Network DRV and it works like a charm.

B005FUTBWS|2.0|Three young men find an online dating site where an older woman is propositioning guys for sex. But the advert is a trap, and they find themselves prisoners of a fundamentalist Christian cult who are trying to purge the world of what they see as amorality brought about by sexual permissiveness and tolerance. When their activities draw the attention of law enforcement officials, the stage is set for a violent confrontation.<br /><br />Kevin Smith is best-known for his string of comedic movies based on pop culture and lowbrow humour: Clerks, Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and so on. He is also known for his interest in religion and theological debates, which, combined with humour, have formed the basis for arguably his most interesting movie to date, Dogma. Red State marks Smith's return to examining religion but this time around there are no laughs: the film is a straight-up drama.<br /><br />After almost twenty years spent making comedies, it's good to see Smith trying out new ideas and breaking new ground for himself as a film-maker. It's such a shame then that Red State is a flat-out mess of a film. Many of the movie's weaknesses are also present in Smith's earlier films, but comedies tend to be much more forgiving of long run-on scenes and structural imperfections. Dramas, especially those with an undercurrent of psychological horror, are much less tolerant of such issues.<br /><br />This problem can best be summed up by the movie's first half-hour. In the first fifteen minutes we are introduced to our three main characters, about whom we virtually learn nothing at all. Aside from their physical appearances, they are interchangeable and do nothing to attract our sympathy or interest. These scenes also establish the presence of a fundamentalist nutjob community in the town, that the town's sheriff has some personal problems and that these three guys are obsessed with sex. The following fifteen minutes form one, incredibly long and tedious scene in whichthe film's antagonist rants on against the evils plaguing America. Because of this John Goodman, the movie's biggest name, doesn't even show up until halfway through the picture.<br /><br />The initial half of the film plays around with the ideas of psychological horror, such as the idea of the three prisoners being tortured or forced to watch the execution of other captives. But Smith doesn't have the patience for this and it isn't long before he ditches the idea in favour of a massive Waco-style shoot-out. Any attempt to engage seriously with the issues raised by the film are thrown out the window the second the shotguns and machine guns start being handed out and it isn't long before we are in the middle of what feels like the longest siege scene in American film history. Because of the failure to set up the action scenes in more depth, they also feel rather trite and manipulative, with Smith borrowing the visual imagery of religious cults and sieges such as Waco without actually engaging with them in any substantive way.<br /><br />The movie does shine a few times: Goodman is great as normal and gets the best characterisation in the movie. Michael Parks is also excellent as the antagonist preacher leading the cult, even selling some of the worst-written scenes and dialogue in the movie. Kerry Bishe isn't given a lot to work with as the preacher's morally-divided daughter, but gives a solid performance as well. Pretty much everyone else in the film is forgettable. The script has potential, but is overwritten with dialogue scenes that go on for far too long after their point is made.<br /><br />Smith does attempt to introduce some moral complexity to the film by shining a light on the dubious activities of the American government in dealing with terrorism, but again in such a ham-fisted way that it comes off as both crushingly obvious and an excuse for more shoot-outs and deaths. And the less said about the ludicrous ending, the better.<br /><br />Red State (**) shows Kevin Smith trying something new in his career, which is laudable, and also has a few good performances and ideas in it. However, it is also not very well-written, its structure and pacing is shot to hell and the serious issues it attempts to raise come across as paper-thin excuses for scenes of violent carnage. The film teeters on the edge of exploiting real, serious and tragic news stories for cheap thrills, which I am certain was not the director's intention.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a challenging, stimulating puzzle game. I love crosswords and sudoku, and I think this game is in that same category. The harder puzzles can take over half an hour to complete, so be prepared to kill a lot of time. I got this as free app of the day, but I play it so much I would buy it, even though it's pricey.
044042335X|5.0|Some people would just leave well enough alone but not Jack Reacher. Child drops his long time subject into yet another volatile situation just daring Reacher not to come out alive....and somehow he does.....I'm beginning to think that Child is trying to off his favorite character but even he can't seem to do it....I like the author and the character and look forward to the next time Jack Reacher steps in the pile of oh'no because it won't end well for someone.... and I want to see it unfold. Again 5 stars for the hero drifter.....
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is an excellent book. The memoir is very engaging, the parts to do with running are inspiring, and the parts to do with food make you want to cook. In fact, today, the day I finished the book, I also made and greatly enjoyed the vegetarian chili.<br /><br />While I have no dreams to run ultramarathons (at 50, my training goal is to move beyond the half-marathon to marathon distance and stop there), such dreams are not required to be captivated by this book, and to take away some profound lessons.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a good and informative story of a Navy Seal. I thouroughly enjoyed it.  The first part of the book dealt with his rise to become a seal.  next were a few missions and then finally Bin Laden.  This was clearly written by a non-proffessional writer, but the simplicity of writing did not detract from the story.<br /><br />I don't understand all the hype by the government over \\"secrets\\" being revealed.  There was very little in this book that hasn't appeared in movies, newspapers, TV, etc.  There are two places where he disses Barak Obama, so maybe that's the reason, but even those were not a large part of the story and nothing that hasn't been said before.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Stephenson always draws you into his world and never talks down to his readers.  Cross-reference for other novels about the enigma machine.  It was in the air for a while, and they were all very different.  And all good. I always appreciate a long book to get into that is full of story and not excess verbiage.
B000002UCN|3.0|EMI Records and George Harrison did not part amicably, as the formation of Dark Horse Records (which was organized under the A&M Records umbrella) was announced before his contract with EMI was even up. So the fact that this compilation, put together to mark his exit from EMI, has some holes in it isn't surprising -- indeed, the fact that it's as good as it is in spots can be considered a point in its favor. And the fact that (somewhat of necessity) it encompasses his Beatles years is a point of strength; at the time, Harrison hadn't recorded as extensively as Lennon or McCartney, and unless one wanted to risk making this a \\"Best of All Things Must Pass plus . . . .\\" there wasn't a lot to do about it. The inclusion of the Beatles-era material, however, also left some glaring weaknesses in covering that area of his history.    Others have complained of the absence of some great music -- in addition to the ALL THINGS MUST PASS tracks \\"Awaiting On You All,\\" \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" \\"Apple Scruffs,\\" and \\"Isn't It A Pity,\\" one can make the strong case for the B-side \\"Deep Blue\\" as a candidate for this collection, among other solo tracks. And as far as the Beatles-era cuts, there should have been at least one of Harrison's sitar-based pieces, either \\"Love You To,\\" \\"Within You, Without You\\" or \\"The Inner Light,\\" as those were a major part of his contribution to the group immediately after the concert years. Additionally, as it turned out, Harrison did have significant success ahead of him, making this collection more a partial best-of for his EMI years, and a prelude to that final burst of activity from the end of the 1980s onward to his untimely death.    That said, the fact that \\"For You Blue\\" and \\"Taxman\\" made the cut speaks well for some of the thinking behind this collection, and as no one was thinking beyond a single LP at the time, the gaps are understandable, if not entirely excusable -- even at the time, the idea of a \\"best of George Harrison\\" held to a single LP didseem to be underestimating his contribution to music. It's still good listening, and no other collection of his work would represent his history with the Beatles (something Harrison himself was deeply ambivalent about) as well as this one does. And anyone buying this CD should also make allowances for the audio quality -- the digital transfer (probably off the assembled master as it existed from 1970-whatever) is no match for the upgrades to either the Beatles or solo cuts as they exist in the twenty-first century.

B009329ZF2|3.0|It's a good movie, perfect for streaming. I love Amazon instant videos and the iPad app is amazing! on my smart tv, Roku box and smart bluray players too. Whats cool is that when you buy the movie or TV show for the iPad app it downloads onto the unit so I can view anytime and do not need wifi.I'm a huge tech head and getting away from cable, feeling more at ease with the streaming options especially with current tv programing being saturated with reality shows. YUCK!
0470913029|1.0|This book is based on a lot of nutritional misinformation. Avoiding Grains and Legumes and increasing meat intake is maybe a fast way to lose weight, but also a fast way to damage your heatlh (you can also try chemotherapy to lose weight and that is guaranteed not healthy). Look how FAT the author is now, he used a much earlier photo for display in his 2010 book. If the paleo diet would be working long-term, why has he gotten so fat !  I live as an Expat for a multinational company in Asia and what I see here all the time is that people eat rice several times a day and are slim and fit. What else prove do you need that the Paleo diet and other low carb fads are wrong. Read the Starch Solution by McDougall M.D. , which proves that this paleo diet is just plain wrong.  You could also check on youtube the video about: Low Carb vs. Plant-Based This really is worth a thousand words !  Beef and cheese increases insulin levels more than oatmeal and only slightly less than whole grain pasta. Please go and check the science. High meat intake promotes cancer, clogs arteries and causes strokes and heart disease. Recommended further reading: &#34;Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease&#34; or the China Study.

0439023513|5.0|OK - Catnip has been transported from Tahir Square to North Korea.....can't wait to see whether Suzanne Collins is a great writer or just a skilled copycat.  Read One and Two - you will be compelled on to Three, as was I.<br /><br />SO:<br /><br />Collins is simply great.  I read One and Two - at Warp Speed....I read this third quickly as well.  There is no helping it one just has to know what happens next.  However since the experience is now over and I still want more, I am reading the third book for a second time.  And it is actually BETTER !<br /><br />I do not give away plots or endings..but I want to say that Collins is a great writer.  The characters are so well formed and so unique one comes to anticipate them  Collins' use of humor and love and terror and every other human emotion is uncanny.<br /><br />Start with Hunger Games.....I almost stayed away because many reviews said it was \\"brutal\\" or \\"simplistic\\"  Do Not Believe it.  These books are well written and have much to say.<br /><br />Yes there is a case for \\"Twilight meets Star Wars\\" but that does not detract from the experience.<br /><br />I got the first two \\"free\\" through Amazon Prime....but there is a waiting period between loans, so I just outright bought this last one.

0321146530|5.0|This book is a must have if you really want to dig into the practice of TDD. Kent Beck describes how you should begin, how to step through tests and production code and comes with handy examples.<br /><br />The book begins with a full example of how to create and evolve software completely test driven. You'll learn how to write the tests, how to fill leaps if you don't have any clue how to write the next test on the list with intermediate tests and you see, how easy design decisions can be applied or reverted if necessary.<br /><br />At the end of the book there is also a discussion about what TDD is all about, how you can apply it to your own skills/practices and what you have to look for when applying it onto new but also existing applications.<br /><br />I liked reading it very much.

0525953728|4.0|'No Easy Day' is a very good book if you want to get an idea of what a Navy Seal does.  While the book does give a first hand account of the mission that killed Osama  Bin Laden...there are no major secrets revealed that you probably didn't already know from the news.  This book is an easy read but most of it focuses on the authors experiences as a Navy Seal. Overall, it kept my interest from beginning to end.

B005HJU7HA|4.0|This is a compilation of the complete body of stories about Sherlock Holmes as written and published by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The only thing lacking is an index, meaning the reader has to take their chances in locating any one particular story in the series.  That cost the collection a star, although I surmise that the low price makes up for it to a degree.<br /><br />They are edited in chronological order, and contain the original story forms rather than digest or shortened versions.<br /><br />As always, they are engrossing.  I recommend this book in Kindle form for long flights, waiting rooms, long bus trips, and those other<br />joys of life where some sort--any sort of relief would be welcomed.

B005LAII8A|4.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt, well-known as the unfortunately lovestruck Tom Hansen from \\"500 Days of Summer\\" reprises his collaboration with director Rian Johnson, with whom he had his break through film, Brick. Bruce Willis adds some star power to the mix as well, which helps to bolster up this film which is little more than a derivative of \\"La Jetee.\\" The story has virtually no development, being more or less a germ of a concept or idea for a story. It also suffers heavily from the clear butcher-marks of studio executives, with many scenes, sidelines, characters, and effects added simply for sensationalistic effect, no doubt in an effort to make the movie more accessible to a wider audience. The voice-over, inserted at crucial times to ensure the audience understands the importance of what is occurring and does not need to exert the effort to think, is at times painful. Flashy CGI effects for floating motorcycles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's creepily rubbery \\"Bruce WIllis\\" make-up do not help the cause. This all detracts from the story, which would be more of a tragedy if the story was better. As it is, one is left with a vague sense of dissatisfaction of jumbled editing overlying a purposefully affected recursive plot line.  The movie achieves it's goal of making back the investment for the studio at the expense of destroying what could have been a far-leaner cult classic.  A flawed gem.

159420411X|5.0|The author reviews both forecasting successes and failures to determine what accurate forecasters have in common. Previously he founded FiveThirtyEight, correctly predicting the 2008 presidential winner at the state level in 49 out of 50 instances, as well as all 35 U.S. Senate races. (Averages other polls, weighted by their prior accuracy.)<br /><br />Prior to Gutenberg the going rate for creating copies was about $40/page in today's prices, and would probably also come with transcription errors - especially if derived from a prior copy. After Gutenberg, the cost of producing a book decreased by about 300X and the store of human knowledge and data began to rapidly accumulate. Errors, as well as truth, could be mass-produced. Best-seller lists were dominated by heretical religious texts and pseudo-scientific ones.<br /><br />Computers have now enormously multiplied our ability to record, copy, and disseminate data. IBM estimates we now generate 2.5 quintillion (10, followed by 18 zeroes) bytes of data/day; 90% of available data was generated within the past two years. Yet, we failed to predict 9/11 and still cannot predict recessions more than few months in advance. Most new information is noise, and it is increasing faster than the signals.<br /><br />Author Silver's first chapter addresses background events to the 'Great Recession, beginning with two definitions. 'Risk' is measurable,' 'uncertainty' is risk that is hard to measure.<br /><br />S&P told investors prior to the Great Recession that when it rated a CDO as AAA there was only a 0.12% probability it would fail to pay out over the next five years. Actually, about 28% did, per S&P internal data. Robert Shiller, studying data going back hundreds of years in Europe, found that as real estate grew to unaffordable levels a crash almost always followed. Japan's commercial real estate bubble of the early 1990s behaved similarly. Common to all - unrealistic assumptions about future appreciation. Policy makers' first reaction was to reflate the bubble - new tax credits, expanded lending capacity for Fannie and Freddie.<br /><br />The WSJ's forecasting panel in December 2007 predicted an only 38% chance of recession in 2008, even though data subsequently revealed we were already in one. The Survey of Professional Forecasters saw less than a one inf 500 chance the economy would crash as bad as it did.<br /><br />In 2007, total home sales in the U.S. approximated $1.7 trillion, while outstanding mortgage-backed securities totaled $80 trillion - leverage of about 50:1. Leverage ratios for major U.S. banks at the time were about 30X.<br /><br />Researcher Reinhart, focusing on recent financial crises, found that ten of the last fifteen never saw unemployment levels return to prior levels. Reinhart and Rogoff previously found financial crises boosted unemployment rates for the next 4 - 6 years. Obama's economic team assumed another typical V-shaped recession. Another problem - the government estimate of the decline when Obama took office was 3.8% - actually, it was about 9%. Thus, corrective actions failed to take reality into account.<br /><br />A major underlying problem for all those involved in the Great Recession - predictions made from historical data that lacked similar situations. Almost no mainstream political scientist foresaw the fall of the Soviet Union and the CIA considerably over-estimated the strength of its economy at the time.<br /><br />Ttlock studied other recent major events - eg. the Gulf War, the Japanese real-estate bubble. Approximately 15%of the events claimed as 'no chance' actually happened, 25% of the 'sure things' didn't. Those quoted the most did the worst. Those who did best incorporated ideas from different disciplines and political positions, were self-critical, cautious, and less ideological. Group forecasts tend to be more accurate.<br /><br />Israel focuses on preventing potential large-scale terrorist attacks, not becoming attack-proof.<br /><br />Continuing, Silver explains how weather forecasting has improved, explains why we can't predict earthquakes, provides background information on how Deep Blue beat chess champion Kasparov, urges us all to become Bayesians (adjusting original probability assessments in light of new evidence), claims the early 2000 dot-com bubble was predictable (P/E multiples had hit 44).<br /><br />Bottom-Line: We're not as smart as we think we are because we can't separate the signal from the noise - pundits especially.r />Continuing, Silver explains how weather forecasting has improved, explains why we can't predict earthquakes, provides background information on how Deep Blue beat chess champion Kasparov, urges us all to become Bayesians (adjusting original probability assessments in light of new evidence), claims the early 2000 dot-com bubble was predictable (P/E multiples had hit 44).<br /><br />Bottom-Line: We're not as smart as we think we are because we can't separate the signal from the noise - pundits especially.

B0085MNZ66|5.0|Well, since I really enjoy playing Flow, despite the negative reviews I decided to give this a shot : I am very glad that I did!  Sounds like some people need to google what other colors are made when mixed together, or I know, maybe pay attention when dragging their finger because the game SHOWS YOU WHAT COLOR WOULD BE MADE...or NOT. ...OR ...maybe the patience and thought process that is required to play a game like this is just to overwhelming and some people should stick with pop the pimple or Doodle sketch.<br />Anyway, an Undo button would be nice for the kindle fire but it's not the end of the world without it...Great Work One Lives Left and how nice of you to respond to reviewers comments!!
1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls is the absolute best book I've read to date regarding insights into life between lives - providing both a foundation and explanation as to what occurs between this life and the next, how the soul evolves, and in a most believable fashion. Easy to understand. It opened my eyes and mind to further exploration of the afterlife and continuation of the life of our souls and how they occur...... It's a great source for providing understanding the difference between new souls and old souls - and provides great understanding for how to accept others as they are, and the why of it all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It took me less than 24 hrs to finish this book. And it leaves you begging for more... 'nuff said.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|This item is worth every penny. Great video/audio, cool bonus features on the DVD, and Gilmour really stretches out on some of the solos. The version of \\"Echoes\\" is my favorite. A must have for any GIlmour/Pink Floyd fan.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I pre-ordered the book, even though the description didn't exactly tantalise, because it was written by an author who could make a grocery list interesting.  I should have waited for the reviews and saved myself $17.  The real JK Rowling is an author with wit and a love for wordplay.  Even her minor characters are so well-drawn, they could carry a book on their own.<br /><br />This is not JK Rowling.  The book is just dull.  The writing is flat, the characters uninspired cardboard, and the plot - well, maybe the release of the book is just bad timing for the US audience.<br /><br />'The Casual Vacancy' gets better reviews from more liberal publications, such as The Guardian.  One conservative paper labelled the book a 'relentless socialist manifesto'.  Personally, I lean toward the liberal side, but that did not make the book more enjoyable.  I get the feeling that the more liberal reviewers wanted to like it for political reasons, but for the most part, even those reviewers had to admit the truth:  it's boring.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is one of -if not the - best mah jong games Ive downloaded.  The graphics are sharp. There are tons of options.  I particulaly like the auto reshuffle when there are no more moves. Keeps me from staring at it forever lol
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Rubbish, a sexed up version of mills and boon, no believable story. Can not see what the hype was all about.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is so awesome it lets you know how many minutes you have until it goes dead.It also lets you know what temperature your device is so you don't over work your device.This app is a must have so get it!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIGWS|4.0|I missed this in the cinemas upon reading all these negative reviews and I regret it now, I watched it online and thought to myself never to judge a movie by critics again but my own eyes. This movie was awesome and so much better than the first one. I am going to get the blu-ray. I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|fun fast paced read. enjoyed it, couldn't put it down. Must read and 100%  better than the movie!! definitely recommended
B00280LYIC|5.0|i loved reading percy jackson and the lighting thief because it had alot of adventure and it was great as a movie. if u read it u will be shocked by the  details and it wil rock your mind.so make sire u have the time to read it!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This movie was entertaining and had a few good scenes. It wasn't a movie that I would have wanted to watch in theater but it is a good watch for at home. Recommended for a rainy or hang on the couch kinda day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great to have mobile! I think it is so much easier to use when not on the computer,  and I love pinterest in general!
B008X8RSTM|1.0|On vacation, I hoped for useable maps and chose City Maps 2Go.  After purchase and download to my Kindle Fire, I had one map but no means-no menu for loading others. This a total failure for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My favorite app! I love being able to create boards that I am interested in. This app is great for all!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lets just make coins an nuts cheaper.<br />because its very hard to make money an then you got to buy money
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I purchase the book for a long flight from Panama City to the US.  I didn't make it out of Panamanian airspace before I deleted it from my Kindle.  The book fails as a history due to the author's biases, and fails as a story because the author's cheerleading of twentieth century european socialism is too transparent.  It isn't even good propaganda.<br /><br />Every major character associated with communism or socialism is given noble characteristics.  Every major character associated with more conservative beliefs is described as stupid or incompetent.  Every single time the leftists lose, it is due to bad luck or trickery by the other side.  Every time they win, it is because their side is better.<br /><br />So essentially this book is the epic battle between flawless, heroic leftists and stick figures.  If this appeals to you, have at it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice entertaining game. Like the goals and realistic game play.  Could be faster coin regeneration but all in all a fun game.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I've owned five copies of exile, vinyl, cassette, cd, remastered cd, and now this version.  All are awesome.  The new version with the extra tracks is another great addition to my collection.  No other group is as diverse as the stones, especially this recording.  ten stars.  How people claim the beatles are better than these guys is a mystery.  Real rock, soul, blues, country, great guitars, vocals, drums, etc.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am a little surprised at the popularity of the trilogy.  Fifty shades darker is more of the same material as the 1st book.  It may be  a little erotic at times, but it gets old after a while.  And the story line is a little lacking.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is awesome!!!! Love hidden object games.....I also play on facebook and got my sis playing as well!!!! Cant get enough of it!!!
B007T99ENE|4.0|Another good book in his special style. Wonderful reliving of life in England in the seventies dramatic years.<br />His writing carries us as always in suspence to the inevitable downfall of the main character.<br />Now I am wondering about her answer, yes or no!
B0085MNZ66|3.0|I got this app as the free paid app of the day from Amazon today.<br /><br />I, like other reviewers here, had a hard time figuring out how to play the game which is like the 2 Router games that were previous free apps of the day from Amazon.  Once I read someone's review who explained how to play this game, it was a much more enjoyable game that added a new twist to the Router games that were offered as free apps of the day earlier this year.<br /><br />So here is why I am giving this game 3 stars:<br /><br />1.  Unlike the 2 Router games that I mentioned above, there is no music option.<br /><br />2.  The lack of instructions.<br /><br />and most importantly is<br /><br />3.  The lack of a \\"real\\" undo option and other button options while playing the game.<br /><br />It would have been nice to have an undo button on the screen as well as a hint option.  Also there are no scoring features or timer features.  So I have to give this one a final rating of 3 stars since there is definitely a lot of room for potential improvement in the visual display & options department.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This may be my favorite, stand alone, novel by Crouch to date. Only stopped reading to sleep, eat- you get it. Simple, pure fun. With a little geo-political satire tossed in. Book worked real well in all aspects. Loved it!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I had to read this book to find out what all the hype was about. I'm glad I did. The Hunger Games was the best book of the three. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. Catching Fire was good too....but a little slower and Mockingjay was my least favorite of the three but I still enjoyed it.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|It's a great Rom-Com.. more serious than the Hugh-Grant types (except 4 Funerals...).. and Portman is fantastic, hands down. Krutcher was even tolerable.. would watch it agsin.. not kitschy and not cliche (too much). Very nice rainy afternoon movie.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great story. Great script. Great characters, and great acting. It all came together. We finally got a Avengers live action movie....too bad we are losing City of Heroes now.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I could not believe how  a great book like this could cost nothing.  I read other books from Marian Keys and was curious about this story line.  It was much better than I expected.  Good characters, good twists and very deep problems.  I highly recommend.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|I liked this book a lot. the beginning and end were well done, however the middle got slightly boring. also, much more adult then i expected. not a kids book!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film and wish I had gone to the theater to see it instead of waiting until it was available on Amazon. Sure the characters were all older, but the underlying story and sentiment is timeless - It's never too late for a second chance at life. Some of the movie was predictable, but it was done with such wonderful acting and terrific development that I didn't mind knowing some of what was going to happen. Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson are always wonderful, and I thoroughly enjoyed Bill Nighy  and Maggie Smith. At the end of the film, I had a smile on my face and that's what counts.
0316228532|3.0|If I had to go off my own enjoyment factor, I would rate it a one. If I am rating it based on the writing, I give it three stars. But seeing as I think I should write the review based on both, so I will give the star rating based on writing and my one star review in here.  :)  Seeing as there are numerous reviews already, I won't go into a synopsis of the book as I do in so many of my other reviews - so I'll just get to the meat of everything.<br /><br />This book, to me, seemed like a Jerry Springer show taped over an entire town.  It showed the darker side of everyone, and the corruption that lies hidden behind this small town. I had a very hard time even getting involved in the world.  I understand her need to set up all the characters from the beginning so as we got into the story, we would know who everyone was and where they all stood. But I did have an issue with keeping up with just how many characters there were.  I almost felt the need to pull up a spreadsheet and write things out. (I almost did... But figured that would take me out of the story too much.)<br /><br />And like this Jerry Springer show (I'm running with a theme here. LOL) it seemed that some of the stuff was scripted WAY over the top just for ratings.  Some of the scenes could have been cut and not hurt the storyline whatsoever and kept the plot moving along.  I don't mind reading long books.  For me, the longer the better when I have time (especially from JKR), but I do have a problem with reading a long book that has scenes in it that seem to be there for shock reasons alone.  The first one occurred fairly early in the book and literally made my stomach churn.  When she talks about a child's private parts and what it did to another child seeing it - I seriously wanted to vomit. It wasn't pertinent to the story at all, and like I said, screamed \\"JERRY! JERRY!\\" to me. Just extra stuff that could be thrown in to shock the readers.<br /><br />Was her writing descriptive, yes.  Did the characters ever really seem to come into their own?  Did they seem to really grow as people and have a reason for being in the books.  Well, yes and no.  The characters seemed very flat to me - some overly stereotypical.  Some of them seemed to at least have the courtesy to think upon their poor actions and show a bit of remorse, but it didn't seem to be the case throughout the book.  I know that not all of them would either because of this real-life setting she was providing, not everyone will be able to overcome their own ignorance to see what is happening around them, and make a change for the better.  That is real life.<br /><br />So while this story wasn't for me, I'm sure there are a lot of people who may like this darker view on life.  This pessimistic (and sometimes revealing and shocking) take on small-town living. There was humor scattered throughout the book, which I had expected from her, but I longed for characters that I could relate with on some level, and maybe in a darker time in my life, I could have.  But more than anything it reminded me of why I refused to watch the Jerry Springer show after a while.  It's too depressing to see how humanity is innately crooked, self-serving, and in some aspect, just evil and vindictive. I read for escape,even in the adult novels I read: however, this one left me pondering if I really wanted to consider myself part of the human race any longer.  The people just seem to cruel if this is typical of how people out there think and shows their true motivations for their actions.<br /><br />Will I read anything else that comes from JKR?  Most definitely.  She has a gift for storytelling, and just because I don't love everything she will ever put out, doesn't mean I condemn her for the book, nor will I swear off her writing.  I will judge each book as it comes out based on its own merit. And again, this book wasn't for me, but there will be some that embrace it fully and love it.<br /><br />And just as a side note... I have seen many people judging the book on its price.  Last time I checked, we live in a place where people can sell their wares for whatever price they choose.  If we deem it worthy enough to pay their price, then it is ours.  If we say, \\"that is WAY too much for me for that item,\\" we don't buy it. If it doesn't sell well for the price being asked, then generally, economics dictate that if you want to sell your product, you lower the price. Seeing as this book hit number one the instant it went on sale... WELL... to me it shows people are willing to pay for her work.  It's like a painting.  Some people look at an abstract work of art and think, \\"I wouldn't pay $5 for that!\\" while others are screaming out price tags in the thousands. Value is all in the eye of the beholder. If you want it and can't afford it, you save up.  If you can afford it and you just think the tag is too high, you don't buy it.  You don't scream at the creators.  To them - this is what it is worth right now.  Maybe it won't be like that later on, but it is for now.  Yes, I know eBooks take no other cost to produce than the original formatting, cover, yadda yadda yadda, but hey, if you made a pretty shiny bracelet that took you $1 to make, but people were offing you $20 a pop for each one - tell me you would say no. On a response here, sure you would or could say no, but like many of the characters in JKR's book, you would take that money and run.  After all, it was YOUR hard work, and you should be able to reap whatever profit you could from your work. Just my own two cents.  :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was far better than the first. I think the movie verison was better than the hunger games book. But catching fire keeps you glued to the pages from word to word. You won't be able to put this down. It's a far better read than the twilight saga and much more thought-provoking. Its about more than just a girl in love or fixated with her own self-indulgences; it's about the possibilities of realities and circumstances and how one deals with what is handed to you. Although the writing is simple and extremely narrative (as is the first) it is highly recommended.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game looks and feels exactly like the 16 bit RPGs I used to play on the SNES (e.g. Final Fantasy 2/4, Chrono Trigger, etc), except with slightly better graphics.  Very professionally done.
0060920084|1.0|I have enjoyed several of Bill Bryson's books.  However in this book , instead of being comical, he comes through as being a cynical, arrogant snob!
B004X75RK4|1.0|One of the worst movies I've watched in a long time.  Sandra was horrible and I can't even remember the  guy\\"s name.  Save you time and watch something else.
0316223239|1.0|I must be missing something with this book that others find.  I felt it was trite and EXTREMELY boring.  By the 25% mark I asked and recieved a refund.  The dialect of the little boy, Jack, drove me nuts, and I found myself skimming to get through the story. If it took off after the initial quarter, I will never know.  The concept is great, but a whole novel? C'mon! It would maybe be a good short story.<br /><br />Rodney Field
034580404X|1.0|Sorry...not impressed...Very demeaning to the female sect.  Can not even understand such twisted thoughts.  Had the trilogy for over a month...only 3/4 ths of the way through the first book...disappointed...I made a bad selection...I'll keep to my murder/mysteries...It's not that I am not sexual...just do not enjoy this books display!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great original story! reminds me of the movie where everyone lives underground City of Ember only much better than that movie. Anyway not much of review just look how many people have read it and everyone agrees 5 stars!! Read it.
B008GX2YQQ|5.0|The critics don't seem to understand this album - or, they have some conceptual need for balance between apparent contribution of the different band members. Just because Avey Tare does most of the singing does not mean that it's 'his' album. You could not produce music like this without amazing collaboration between band members. I think of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, and the amazing level of sophistication, energy, and flow amongst band members that makes the whole much greater than the sum of the parts.<br /><br />This album, and this group, push the limits of music, and do it in a warm and human way that often gets lost in music that depends so much on electronic elements.<br /><br />Most inspiring and energizing album I've heard in years. Thank you Animal Collective!
B008IYOEZM|1.0|**This review is coming to you from a LOYAL Dexter fan**<br /><br />Season 6 sucks and in my experience, great shows that go beyond their 5th season usually do. The story line for this season could have been epic, but bad writing and terrible acting from Tom Hanks' son (Tom Hanks' son!!! WTF is he doing on Dexter anyway?) made this season boring and just silly. (Possible spoiler in the next line) And I will curse this show for good if they develop the story line of \\"romance\\" between Deb and Dexter (gross!!!!). If Season 7 continues down the path of crummy scripts and crummy acting, I will cross this show off my list of \\"great shows\\".
030758836X|4.0|A marvelous read about marriage, murder mystery, insanity and even horror. I had chills at the conclusion of this tale. Highly recommend.
B004EPYZUS|3.0|I am really not a very demanding viewer when it comes to movies, give me a shallow plot and half a dozen good explosions and I'm good to go.  Perhaps if I had not seen the first three Mission Impossible flicks I would have really enjoyed this one, but compared to its predecessors Ghost Protocol is at best an okay movie.  Don't get me wrong, I've watched the DVD several times, it's fun, I like it.  But it will never be anything more than \\"okay\\".  Cruise should have stopped while he was ahead.<br /><br />Still, who knows maybe Mission Impossible 5 will come up with a really dynamite plot, and if not there will always be MI 6 or 7 or . . .
B00136RVUC|4.0|I have been listening to this album a lot since I got it 2 weeks ago. I would recommend Texas Flood as a good first Stevie Ray album--it was mine. His guitar sounds like it's just dying to make energetic and unpredictable music, and Stevie's job is to choose when to let it out. He makes the guitar sound like a living thing. And he is a great singer. I never liked his music before, but since I moved to Dallas I've been drawn to the myth of Stevie Ray and now I've come full circle and really like his music, too.
B0086700CM|5.0|oz a grate game. run awhile and then you will get lag and glitches.<br />also buy coins for kindle fire and runrunrunurnurnhrn
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is really good. It has a clear Rush vibe combined with a modern sound. It has moments it reminds me of the parts of Presto I liked, without the cheesy 90's Pop, and a bit of their attempt to reconnect with rocking roots named Counterparts - but more sophisticated. There are parts of this that remind me of Primus and Tool as well - both of whom were clearly influenced by Rush.<br /><br />One of the last times I saw Rush live...Niel Pert couldn't do his drum solo; it looked like they had to bring him Oxygen; and the performance fell short. Then, later: the Snakes and Ladders album fell completely flat for me. So - I wrote off Rush as an Old Man Band and hoped they wouldn't fade ungracefully into the night like the Rolling Stones, or more embarrassingly ZZ Top and Aerosmith.<br /><br />I am happy to say - this is not the case. They are back in a big way with this album. And man am I happy. I inherited early Rush albums on vinyl and cassette ranging from Fly By Night to Grace Under Pressure; and Rush was one of the first bands I saw live. Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures are still two of my favorite albums - and it's a pleasure to hear solid new material from the same team of musicians that made that magic.<br /><br />The emotions and nostalgia of youth tend to cement favorite albums in a position that simply cannot be replaced once one is older - no matter how good the new material is. So - while this will never hit the sweet spot of those early albums in my early life - if one were a teen again - and this is the first musical manna from the trio one experiences - would rank up there with their best?<br /><br />In the end I don't think this stands out as much in terms of music and lyrical innovation as the late 70's-80's era Rush. I would give this 4/5....except...anything this good; from guys this old; who have made 20+ albums - you just have to give 5/5 to, step back, and applaud.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|this game is really fun. better without instruction because it is a twist of another game and done nicely. great faotd
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love the app but from time to time just quits responding and you have to force close. Needs a few bugs fixed.
0425166805|5.0|Chariots of the Gods is a very likable book to read and Mr. Erich Von Daniken<br />has written it with a lot of questions to be thought about and questions that<br />need to be looked at an answered. Very good reading!
B00096S49O|5.0|This movie made me laugh so many times! Really funny and interesting :) . I'm really glad i got it and i would recommend this to everyone i know.
B007549W62|4.0|After a nuclear war breaks out, a group of people make their way to a bunker in an apartment building and get hauled up inside, afraid to leave- in fear they may be poisoned by some kind of nuclear chemicals in the air.<br /><br />One of the guys involved is the buildings superintendent, who kind of runs the show. He has total control over supplies/food,  or thinks he does..,until the people hauled up in the bunker get sick of him and turn on him- But he's not the only whacko in that bunker or is nothing compared to the other guys.<br /><br /> Trapped down there with nowhere to go and some terrorists trying to break into the bunker some of them end up turning on eachother and going crazy.<br /><br />So we know there are terrorists of some kind or someone who wants to go to war with the United states or nuke them but we don't know who exactly- ( though they give vague clues), you can kind of figure it out but you don't know why or what their motive is- even at the end. They wear white hazmat suits or some type of gear and 'experiment' on people and they also want the americans dead- we don't get too find out much more than that. The film is more about the interaction and struggles between the characters trapped in the bunker.<br /><br />Left a lot out but was still pretty entertaining. It kinda gives clues as to exactly what's happening but leaves certain parts to the imagination. I liked it but I didn't like certain parts of it. Kind of extreme. I also thought the ending wasn't good enough. I wish there was more explanation for some of the stuff. But overall, solid. 3.5- 4.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I started to watch this movie 7 times in the past two years and never got to finish it 'cause something always came up :/ so i finally decided to get the dvd and try to finish it, and now i've finally seen the ending ^_^ (the ending and the beginning and the middle were great by the way)
B0013F1D02|5.0|I bumped into this in prime videos.  What a find!  I should have suspected it would be good with Neil Gaiman involved. (Dr. Who). This movie has fantasy, action, comedy and drama.  The cast is wonderful.  I highly recommend this movie and believe I will be watching it again!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this. Play it every night. Needs more free puzzles and a change of options. I have found others but keep coming back to this one cause I love it so much!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|shares everything on everything, everywhere, use it in your laptop, phone (even an old windows phone), pad... and have your notes, files etc always with you.

1455502758|5.0|This last book highlights the one fact that all who have read Hitchens already know: he was a magician with words - spoken and written. Mortality is Hitchens facing the inevitability of the end. The words are powerful, the analogies and descriptions of his illness vivid and the emotion hidden behind the words genuine. In death, he has done what most cannot do while alive: have the last word ... and what words they are.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great realistic account of the teams and DEVGRU.  Kept you turning the pages even though you knew the outcome. Great insight into the minds of our fighting men and their opinions of the executive level of command.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I cant even explain it. I'm over 50 levels in and still find it entertaining. its easy and my 4yr old likes it too.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I was playing and I got out of my game then I wanted to play again but it erased every thing I made and didn't let me create a new world don't get!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, and serial read it to the end, unable to but it down. I would have liked to see more depth in the relationships and layers to the storytelling, but a fantastic read none the less! Recommended!
1577312082|5.0|One of the hardest things to do is to let go of what we perceive as \\"bad\\" events in life, accept that they happen and move forward unreservedly.  Eckhardt's philosophy dissects life's events and helps one understand that fighting events is a waste of precious time and energy, and that moving forward can't happen until acceptance takes place.<br />I was laid off twice in 2 years through no fault of my own. I felt ashamed and humiliated to use unemployment credits to pay for food. I lost my home and my once impeccable credit. 10 million Americans were suddenly in the same situation, but I felt especially cheated.  I quickly found a lesser job to get off government assistance, but for a solid year, I cried and complained to anyone who would listen about how unfair it was. A good friend recommended \\"The Power of Now\\" CD set.  I painfully listened to Eckhardt's strange voice and slow cadence while driving each morning and evening. When my thoughts drifted off, I replayed the track and forced myself to focus.  Then, I listened again and again, hearing something new each time.  I think we all inherently know crying over spilled milk is useless, and that tomorrow is promise to no one, but advertiser's play on past tragedy and prod us to fear the future in order to take our cash. Learn to ignore them and live fully in the present.<br />Hearing and practicing \\"The Power of Now,\\" for roughly 5 months, helped me change my perspective, heal from the anger and bitterness of losing a job, and I open my mind to new possibilities. I was able to pray again and a great job opened up. Shortly afterward, I loaned out my CD's and the borrower lost them. It's been two years, so I've just received my second set to reinforce what I learned.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game. it reminds me of my childhood years going to the county fair. it's a great way to kill time.
0062071017|5.0|Great overall viewpoint and very current with the emphasis on individuals and their companies, small or large! Easy read, moves quickly, and is not full of academic prose. Thx for a great little summary of leadership and strategy for those of us that are managing our own small companies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These three books were something I couldn't put down. When you get past the brutality and the sex, the story line is extremely well written and you want to read more and more.  I would read these again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its really fun. great way to pass some time. I wish some of the games were easier though. I sometimes get frusturated while playing.

0691152640|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this book has indeed been extravagantly praised, I think partly because of the sheer dogged diligence of the writers as they plowed through a seemingly endless array of financial crises over history to attempt to answer the question \\"is this time different?\\".  Unfortunately, there's little true drama driving this research, as the authors basically reconfirm the existence of the business cycle throughout history.  Thus at the end of the day it's a bit of a dog bites man story.  Page after page one hears the same tale doggedly repeated, and the simple message that is confirmed is merely the wisdom of the ages.  As a solidly-researched reply to those who argue that \\"this time is -- or was -- different\\" it's a great book to use; a bit heavy for that purpose alone, however.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I've been playing on my kindle for almost a year. Older version was a bit buggy. But the latest version Works great!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The film was watchable and held my interest because of the cinematography.  Plot wise it was predictable but not well developed or at least some of the characters were just there throughout the movie and really were not tied in well to the script.  Two bag of pop corn and a drink with this movie will be enjoyable, but not very memorable.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|After reading Fall of Giants, I was disappointed  I would have to wait for this book for so long to continue, but I was not disappointed. The best thing about Follett is that his trilogies can stand alone without having read the first book. I remembered very little about the characters until I got going in the book and then  many things came back as he reminds the reader. Good thing, I read about 100 books a year and this is one I had waited for way too long! Now that I am done, please hurry up with book three. Do not let the 940 pages daunt you...it will keep your interest throughout and you begin to really care about the characters and also despise some of the machinations they make to create chaos.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, masterfully explained, Follett continues to be a favorite. I was a bit disheartened at first, near the beginning when he mentioned Jean Nate perfume and Milk Bones as I did not think that was anachronistically correct, but it was...I looked it up! Bravo Ken!
0385344333|5.0|Having suffered through a couple of Lee Child clunkers over the past few years, I really enjoyed \\"A Wanted Man,\\" a classic Jack Reacher thriller which may have been light on the patented Reacher bone-crunching, but delivered the suspense through a thoughtful, intelligent plot.  When Lee Child is on his game - when he leaves the politics behind and delivers stories as lean and mean as his stoic Jack Reacher - there is no one better; no one that can match Child's clean action and unambiguous storylines, or go toe-to-toe his larger-than-life hero, while so effortlessly executing the perfect escapist entertainment. Rest assured, Lee Child in on his game, despite some negative reviews, in \\"A Wanted Man.\\"<br /><br />Like most Child novels, this one blasts out of the gate, grabbing the reader by the throat on page one.  An eyewitness sees three men enter a deserted Nebraska highway bunker, but only two emerge, leaving the third lying in a pool of his own blood.  Meanwhile, still hulking and ominous, but an aging and battered Jack Reacher is trying to get to Virginia, finding thumbing rides along the Midwest cornfield highways increasingly difficult.  He finally snags one, picked up by two men and a woman who Reacher surmises are returning from some kind of corporate team building exercise.  But the always-observant Reacher notes discrepancies in the small talk of the men in the front, and notes the woman withdrawn and disconnected.  When the quartet encounters multiple police road blocks along the way to Chicago, Reacher is convinced his new travel companions are not who they pretend to be.<br /><br />On the other side of town, the local sheriff determines than man-in-the-bunker was professionally executed, and soon the FBI is on the scene, followed shortly after by a Homeland Security counter-terrorism team.  Child runs the two stories in parallel for nearly half the book - Reacher observing the strained dynamics in the car, while Kansas City FBI agent Julia Sorensen tries to figure out the motive behind and the identity of the bunker murder.  The stories collide, taking a couple of unexpected turns and twists, leading to a climax chock full of a vengeful Reacher's mayhem missing for most of the book.<br /><br />\\"Wanted Man's\\" Reacher may not be as menacing as we're accustomed to, but his mind and flawless logic and powers of observation are still as sharp as a brawny Sherlock Holmes.  While Child never lets the prose get in the way of a good story, he paints neat pictures of a desolate Midwest landscapes dotted with ominous relics of the Cold War.  And as always, Child keeps the level a few notches above typical guilty-pleasure pop thriller fare by stuffing the pages with facts and minutia that should be tedious, but instead fit neatly into the intrigue and suspense.<br /><br />\\"A Wanted Man\\" was one of those rare books that I really didn't want to put down - when I wasn't reading it I was looking forward to getting back to the drama.  So the one and two star reviews were surprising.  Perhaps it can be attributed to less action than the typical Reacher thriller, but I'd disagree that, as some have suggested, Child used a ghost writer.  As I see it, the pace, the detail, dialog and backdrop is all vintage Lee Child - not a style that is easily mimicked -  and if Reacher, now over 50, is somewhat more vulnerable, that only adds credibility.  If you're a Jack Reacher fan, do yourself a favor and don't skip this one.s to figure out the motive behind and the identity of the bunker murder.

B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like the MicroShell case. It makes it easier to hold the Kindle Fire. I got it in pink, it's a nice color. It fits my K Fire just right. I always slip my hand through the strech strap, just to make sure I don't drop my Kindle. When closed the back part that makes the stand, comes around to the front and covers the screen. I like that because it keeps the dust off the screen. I would have given five stars except for one thing. The slot in the back of the case, where the cover goes to make a stand could have been a little deeper. Sometimes the cover slips out of the grove, but not too often. It weighs almost nothing so it does not add any noticeable weight to the Kindle. I'm glad I got it, it's nice.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a very entertaining book that is hard to put down once you've started it. The stories are exciting, but more importantly, they are used to convey important themes, including:<br /><br />1. The roles of luck, preparation, and skill as success factors in life.<br />2. The importance of sacrificing to be part of a greater good.<br />3. The value in learning from mistakes.
034580404X|5.0|Many people have classified this as mommy \\"porn\\".  It really isn't.  There are some graphic scenes that explain the character and his issues.  It is a very modern, brave series and you have to read it with an open mind and realize that it explains not only \\"Christian Grey\\", but many others with similar issues from childhood. I am 50 and did not find it offensive in the least.  I waited until all three were available so that I could read them right after each other.  The three were shipped together in a great shipping box and the box keeps the three together on my shelf. Great buy!

B000A5044C|4.0|\\"Nobody Knows\\" is a 2004 Japanese film directed by Hirokazu Koreeda.  Based loosely on an abandonment tragedy that occurred in the late 80s, it follows the lives of four children left to fend for themselves in a small Tokyo apartment.<br /><br />And it IS loosely based.  I've read some unfavorable reviews from people upset that the film didn't stay true to the original incident, but perhaps they expect too much.  \\"Based on a true story\\" has become one of the more annoying tags in cinematic advertising and lending it your faith while choosing a film is a mistake.  Had the real story never happened, this would simply be an unsettling, successful drama.  Judging it harshly because it doesn't mirror the original events isn't so much a review of the movie as it is a stab at cozen marketing.  This, to me, is a disservice.<br /><br />\\"Nobody Knows\\" is a delicate, wonderfully acted film, and certainly worth what's being asked here.  The cinematography is minimalistic, highly effective, and the synergy between these child actors is remarkable.  I've read online that the director put massive efforts towards creating a realistic environment for these kids and it shows - the interactions felt very real.<br /><br />I think the only caution I'd air is that the stills used to advertise this film represent something a bit more pleasant than what's actually being delivered.  Not to say that this wasn't a rewarding viewing experience, but if you're looking for a feel-good film, you'll probably do well to move along.  While it's not as gruesome as the real incident, it definitely houses some sad days.<br /><br />I'd also advise that it's a long film - some 145 minutes.  My wife and I broke it in half over two nights and it worked out well.  That's still a bit long for my taste but we're glad we picked it up and we'll be watching it again.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br />- t

There is something for everyone to learn from this story!<br /><br />~Amy Maurer Jones
B007ZFZI8C|5.0|An album of cover songs by a woman with a golden voice. No crazy tricks or pointless vocal acrobatics, just straight up great singing. One of my favorite things about Melanie C is that you can hear her smile when she sings, and this is no exception. This is certainly a departure from her usual style, but she nails the whole thing. If you like music, and you like to be happy, this album is for you.

B00846REIS|5.0|I purchased this book for the main reason of wanting my own copy in kindle format.<br /><br />50 Shades was my first venture into reading this type of book and I only did so because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I've since completed reading all 3 books in the trilogy and thought they were ok.<br /><br />I heard about this book written by Sylvia Day. It was being compared to 50 Shades so I decided to borrow it from the library.<br />I enjoyed this book much more than 50 Shades. It was better written. I decided to get a copy for my collection of digital books. I am looking forward to the next 2 installments of Sylvia Day's trilogy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Navy seals are certainly a different breed of men. This book is a personal detail of his life as a frogman. Why the president and all the fools in Washington would be against this book is unbelievable! If more fanatics around the world would read a book about the capabilities of our military, they may think twice about starting action against the Unite States. Our covert troops are everywhere and they are not untouchable. Great book. I would be ticked off that the President would take any credit taking down BinLaden if I was a seal!

0525476881|3.0|I enjoyed Paper Towns and The Fault in Our Stars a lot, but I didn't like An Abundance of Katherines nearly as much. The book is about this boy named Colin Singleton, who has dated 19 girls named Katherine, all of which have dumped him. So he goes on a road trip with his Judge-Judy obsessed friend Hassan, and meets a girl who is miraculously not named Katherine. He's also working on a highly complicated formula that will predict the future of any relationship. I thought An Abundance of Katherines had an interesting premise, to say the least, but it never really panned out. I just wasn't engaged by it. The characters were OK, and there were some funny parts, but it wasn't like I was eager to see what happened next. I did like the design of the hardcover edition though.<br /><br />All of John Green's books seem to feature trips of some kind, which is definitely a good starting point, but this one just never got off the ground. I would definitely recommend Paper Towns and The Fault in Our Stars, but not this one. And I am looking forward to reading Looking For Alaska.<br /><br />All of my reviews can be read at my blog at novareviews.blogspot.com.

0307744434|5.0|\\"It is not only about what you call magic. [...] It is more than that. Everything you do, every moment of the day and night is a move. You carry your chessboard with you, it is not contained within canvas and stripes. Though you and your opponent do not have the luxury of polite squares to stay upon.\\"<br /><br />Welcome to Le Cirque de Rêves. Are you ready for a game of true magic?<br /><br />The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is the story of Celia and Marco, chosen when they were children to be part of a game that would test their magical abilities and push them to their limits. Selected as they were by their paternal figures, they had no say of their own, making them not only players but pawns. Neither child knew the identity of their competitor, initially, but as they grow older, their paths cross, and the stakes are raised when one recognizes the other's abilities and their stories intertwine.<br /><br />It is said that this game has gone for some time, each time with two competitors, but the rules are never stated and the forum is the world at large. This is the world we know - the average person lives an average life troubled by gravity, responsibility, and other people - as opposed to a wholly supernatural world. (Or is it?) The talents these people possess are unknown to the general populace, and they walk amongst us with ease. For example, Celia becomes an illusionist at the circus, where people are blown away by her tricks, not knowing they are real, not knowing that she actually is transmogrifying objects.<br /><br />This particular round of competition book begins in New York in 1873, when a five-year-old girl with an envelope pinned to her coat arrives at a theater:<br /><br />The theater manager does not need to read the envelope to know who the girl is for. The bright eyes peering out from under a cloud of unruly brown curls are smaller, wider versions of the magician's own.<br /><br />This is Celia. Her mother has taken her own life, and the envelope contains her suicide note. The magician, Prospero, aka Hector Brown, immediately recognizes her abilities. Within months, he has contacted another man, volunteering his daughter without her consent or understanding and setting the new game in motion.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a boy is adopted, his mysterious caretaker picking him out to be the other player. Soon, the boy's fingers are covered in ink as he fills journals with words and symbols and reads all of the books he can get his stained hands on. This is Marco.<br /><br />Neither of them recite spells. Neither of them invoke names of gods and goddesses. Their powers are typically contained and controlled by their minds, put into action with a flick of the wrist or no movement at all, just a thought, just a suggestion, just a desire.<br /><br />Then Le Cirque de Rêves - The Night Circus - is created. This unique collection of tents presents attendees with performers and sights to see set in black and white, stark contrasts and amazing feats illuminated by bright white fire. Each tent has a different performer or theme: a contortionist, a tarot card reader, the cat-tamers. Many of the tents have things one can't experience in daily life, imaginative, sensory, and mystifying things which often seem to exceed the limits of the tent walls, allowing people to explore labyrinths and walk on clouds, to relive personal memories and revisit their pasts, to release their sorrows and lighten their burdens. Marco is an assistant to the creator of the circus; Celia is hired as an illusionist.<br /><br />As the game plays out, the story deepens. Pay close attention to the date and location placed beside each chapter title to stay oriented. Time travel is never an element of the story, but the chapters do oscillate between the late 1800s and the early 1900s, with the anticipation increasing as the two paths become closer and closer on the timeline. In addition to Celia, Marco, and their paternal puppeteers, important characters include a clockmaker, an architect-engineer, a retired prima ballerina, two chatty sisters, a boy who yearns to escape the trappings of his family life, and a pair of young twins with paranormal abilities. I really liked Poppet and Widget, the twins who were born the night the circus begins. I also thought the twist on the ghost character was inventive. As the circus moves from town to town and time marches on, alliances are won and lost as truths are revealed or concealed. It's a very intriguing story, and everything builds to the finishing moves in the game.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me, and now I am recommending it as well. I enjoy stories with empowered characters, be they magically empowered and/or strong of mind. Celia and Marco's abilities are quite different, yet complimentary. Celia's illusions often appear effortless - a shake of her head changes her hair color, a la The Craft; her birds morph from paper to winged and in flight and back to paper - but when considering what her father did to her to strengthen her abilities, one realizes the price she's paid to live this life, far before the ultimate conclusion. Morgenstern's writing is never more lovely than when a character is telling a story, especially the chapter entitled The Wizard in the Tree.<br /><br />If you like stories with magic of this sort - powers of the mind projected, made into reality, or breathtaking illusions - then you should definitely pick up this book. It could be and has been compared to Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, but I greatly prefer The Night Circus. If only Morgenstern's name was Gorgenstern, then this book would be shelved next to Christopher Golden's books, making that shelf of fantasy novels even more fantastic. (I wonder what would happen if Tsukiko from The Night Circus met Kitsune from The Veil trilogy...)<br /><br />\\"Someone needs to tell those tales.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and I have a message for Poppet and Widget: If you ever need a sitter for the kittens, I'm available.rs include a clockmaker, an architect-engineer, a retired prima ballerina, two chatty sisters, a boy who yearns to escape the trappings of his family life, and a pair of young twins with paranormal abilities.

Seriously, I tuned this movie out until it got to the end when it became more interesting and I put down my Kindle.  When the credits rolled, I couldn't help but think... so glad I didn't go to the theatre to see this major disappointment.

B0077PBPJ6|5.0|Brace yourself- if you prefer movies that follow the cookie-cutter made for mainstream so you don't have to think or feel anything after watching, this isn't for you. However, if you enjoy being pulled in by raw emotion, gorgeous scenery, realistic characters and plotlines this should be a must-have in your collection. I am not usually compelled to purchase many movies, but I needed to own Birdsong. For those that are put-off by violence in movies as I am myself, I will say that Birdsong dooesn't glamorize it or make it intolerable to watch- the juxtoposition between love story and war story balances the film out nicely. A beautiful 'masterpiece' indeed.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|OK, \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" isn't precise history.  It's heavily-fictionalized, but it's compelling TV.  My interest was spurred by Judge Johnson's book.  Living in southern N.J., it's an essential text for understanding local history.<br /><br />  The TV show uses that as a starting point for drama.  You don't watch it to learn history.  This is well-crafted video that keeps you watching because you don't know what's coming next.  It captures the era in many ways...politics, culture, mindset.  The decor and the props are faithful, too.<br /><br />  Stories I like tend to get watched again and again.  So this was a must-own for me.  Honestly, your \\"new\\" price beat what I've seen for used sets elsewhere (it was a special deal).

In reality, these songs are perhaps the weakest material of her career. It's unfortunate that this didn't dawn on either Kylie or her producers. Notably absent are gems like \\"Chocolate\\"(arguably her best single to date), \\"Breathe\\", \\"Giving You Up\\", \\"What Do I Have to Do\\", \\"Hand on Your Heart\\", \\"Come into My World\\", \\"The One\\", \\"Loving Days\\", etc.  Skip this train-wreck and wait for a better compilation.

Gotta' start somewhere.<br />This movie is a CLASSIC and RUTH GORDON is an ICON. Done in 1972, this movie is very much of that era, and yet, it is completely timeless. I saw it about 35 years ago and loved it. It has not lost anything. Maybe I like it even more than before. It is described as a black comedy. It's funny, but it is, also, so much more. It is a lesson. One we would all be so much better off learning. The CAT STEVENS sound tract is great and fully fits (like a glove) where this film goes. Interesting for me is the locale. Seeing recognizable sites in San Francico, Marin, and San Mateo county that are 40 years old. Also, Tom Skerritt has a part when he was billed as M. Borman. (I like cinema history and trivia)<br />It eventually becomes a May/December romance. Sounds icky. BUT IT'S NOT. Again, THIS MOVIE IS A NATIONAL TREASURE. I SO HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B008S80P38|3.0|Great tracks but a different style, however highly disappointing that the tracks do not flow into each other. You know when a new track is coming on. I recommend castration for the person at Ultra who decided each track should be on its own...

B004IQ78HA|4.0|I shared this movie with my 4 year old daughter for the first time recently. It's a true classic that should be shared with every generation.
0316228532|5.0|I just finished reading this book. I couldn't put it down. The lives of the characters ring true to me, probably because I taught quite a few students who were \\"Krystal\\". I purposely did not look at some of the other reviews, but one reviewer seemed to be offended by some of the events taking place in the book. I hate to say this, but there are more \\"Krystals\\" than you probably know out there and they are quite desperate people. Ms. Rowling's characterization is true to me in all respects, but then I live in a small American town. We have all the same people here, we have \\"projects\\" and \\"welfare moms\\" nearby in a slightly larger town. Her description of political maneuvering in elections in small towns is exceptionally honest as is her portraiture of adults who cannot control computer sites as well as the teenagers involved. (But then I worked with teachers who did not know how to turn on their own computers, but I digress.)Throwaway children die every day and no one helps them, because they are dirty and smell bad. Teenagers commit suicide and cut themselves because of family problems. If you want fantasy, read the Harry Potter books. This book is very true to life and not just true to England. It could be set anywhere.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I was exited to get this game or account or whatever you call it after my sister told me about and my friend showed me it. what I didn't know is that it takes forever to load pretty much everything. this really bothers me and makes it hard to enjoy the game. if the creaters fix this little problem I would give it a five star review. the photos are funny or cool (minus the innapropriate ones) and I love it. it just needs to load faster on a kindle fire.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I thought that the transformation of Mr. Grey was interesting when he realized that there is more in a relationship than just sex.  Actually in reading the three books, one could see that his actions were beginning to change as he began to develop strong emotional ties to Anastasia and fall in love with her.  I enjoyed the trilogy very much.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this was my fav app now it no longer download or play music please FIX  all it says.is searching then nothing
B005USZYDU|5.0|An amazing book for good young readers and<br />early teens! As always, John Grisham weaves a wonderful story with humor and suspense.  My favorite author - and now, my 10 year old grandson's favorite as well!

B0053O89JM|5.0|The last season lived up to my expectations - every episode was great, especially the last one.<br />The DVDS were in new condition as promised.<br />I was very happy with this purchase.
B008KGPEQG|4.0|If you like well written, introspective autobiography, then you will be satisfied with this book.  That being said, the word, 'maundered' comes to mind, but maybe the review of any life could be described this way.  Which is why we turn to books, though, isn't it?  There are a few bits that could've been chopped while still maintaining the integrity of the narrative.  Beautiful in places, then mundane, poetic, pedantic, wondrous.  Strangely, though, no regrets purchasing it...
0345505387|1.0|I did not realize what type of book it was or would not have order it. Those type of books insult a good reader intelligence.
B008QDCZJ2|4.0|The Pet Shop Boys have crafted an excellent Pop album.  It is a bit softer and quieter than typical PSB work, and really only one song I'd consider danceable.  I appreciate the change, though I'm somewhat disappointed that the special edition only included instrumentals and not any b-sides or remixes.  I knew that going into purchasing, but would have liked a few bonus songs.<br /><br />Leaving, the 2nd single being released, is a good song.  Invisible is actually my least favorite song on the album.  Winner, the 1st single and associated with the Olympics, is an uplifting and fun song.  Your early stuff is sarcastically witty and fun, but not one of my favorites.  A Face Like That is the true dancfloor song that I really enjoy.  My absolute favorite song, by far, is the sixth song, Breathing Space.  The instrumental version on the 2nd disc truly shows just how beautiful the music is to this wonderful song.  I listen to it over and over again.  Ego Music is my second least favorite song, sort of annoying actually.  Hold On and Give It a Go are both good pop songs.  Memory of the Future is my second favorite song.  Everything Means Something is okay.  The CD ends with Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin, written for a deceased friend, that has a great '70's pop song vibe to it - it ends the CD very well.<br /><br />Overall, a very good album.  Not for you if you want dance.  But if you want luscious pop music with a few good beats and a few beautiful ballads, then this is for you.

B00932A6G4|4.0|Lets start of by saying none of the Starship Trooper movies can compare with the Original. However, this one came pretty close. The only reason why I took a star away is because the CGI needs to be polished and the dialogue needs to be smoother.Also, the characters look all alike, at times it's a bit difficult to remember who's who.<br /><br /> A lot of people commented on the bath scene, but I think it's there for us to remember there was a all nude scene in Star Ship Troopers 1.
B001F4UHFI|5.0|Spellbinding movie based on a true story about how our government uses undercover agents to sell arms to third-world countries.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This is eveything a fan would want in a 2 Cd set from Susan Tedschi, husband Derek Trucks and their large new band. As opposed to the more concise studio work, there's a lot more time given to guitar solos, a great bass solo from Oteil Burbridge, a drum duet and even a flute solo. The entire band is in fine form and the CD is just excellent from start to finish. 5 Stars.
0486278077|5.0|A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of  material values related to physical beauty and immortality  drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self. His life takes a swift turn for the worse when he sees the awful expression of his rotten soul expressed on his own face painted in a portrait. Oscar Wilde wrote an essay intended to decry certain paramount values acclaimed by western societies. It features rich pieces of wisdom and underlying messages. Great ending
B0084I9QIW|5.0|If you are not one of those people who are so spoiled by modern technology that they are only able to enjoy something if it's HD/Blue-ray quality then I highly recommend this concert!<br /><br />Jackson's Estate did not make a secret of the fact that they could only find an old VHS in his personal collection from which they could restore the video of this concert. The camera angles aren't perfect either as what you see on the video is what was recorded for the Jumbotrons during the concert. The audio on the other hand was recorded on multitracks, so that's great.<br /><br />Despite of these handicaps I still rate this concert 5 stars because Jackson's mesmerizing performance more than makes up for them! Surprisingly the stage show is rather purist, especially compared to what we see in many concerts today. No spectacular stage scenes, no high-tech effects, no laser shows, no fireworks, not even an army of dancers (there are only four, besides Jackson himself), no strip shows, no pole dancers. There are a couple of costume changes (like the inevitable warewolf and zombies in Thriller), but we cannot talk about a parade of spectacular costumes either. Mainly it's just Jackson and his singing and dancing. And that is good so! Actually it's one of the most impressive things to me about this concert and Jackson himself: that the concert has a kind of magic feel to it, you just cannot take your eyes off the screen for two straight hours, it's highly entertaining, enjoyable, uplifting, breath-taking, mesmerizing - and that's all down to Jackson and his talent, charisma and stage presence and not to stage gimmicks and high-tech! He was a truly great performer.<br /><br />Maybe because of the lack of gimmicks and high-tech, but the concert has a kind of intimate charm too - if you can say that about a show in front of 72,000 people. It's hard to put this into words but I don't see the type of mechanical, calculating, cold artificiality in it that I see in so many concerts by other singing-dancing stars. Jackson is light on his feet, he's cool, relaxed, joyful, clearly enjoying himself, like he was born to do it. He probably was. His happiness is infectious too. And all the while he's putting on an amazing show.other singing-dancing stars. Jackson is light on his feet, he's cool, relaxed, joyful, clearly enjoying himself, like he was born to do it.

B0084I9QI2|5.0|This is a great boxset with 3 CDs and 1 DVD. CD1 contains the original Bad album (remastered). CD2 contains some bad era outtakes and demos plus three remixes. Remixes are not my thing but the Speed Demon remix by Nero is a good one if someone enjoys remixes. I love the demos. The CD starts with the demo Don't Be Messin' Round which is, in my opinion, the weakest/less finished of them, but the other demos are great. I cannot really decide which one is my favorite of them, I enjoy them all.<br /><br />The crown jewel of the boxset is, however (to me at least), CD3 and the DVD which contains Jackson's concert from July 16, 1988 at the Wembley Stadium. (Would you believe that it's the first time a live audio CD of Jackson has been released?)<br /><br />If you are not one of those people who are so spoiled by modern technology that they are only able to enjoy something if it's HD/Blue-ray quality then you will appreciate this DVD!<br /><br />Jackson's Estate did not make a secret of the fact that they could only find an old VHS in his personal collection from which they could restore the video of this concert.

1609611543|3.0|No, I wasn't overweight but I did possess a row of fat around the midsection that was a permanent resident. Treadmilling, cutting back on sweets and fats didn't eliminate the problem.  I went from white to wheat bread for the health reasons long before hearing about \\"Wheat Belly.\\"  I dropped wheat bread immediately and have eliminated other products that are made with wheat as best that I can.  You'll find that numerous products have wheat as one of their ingredients.  My menu became limited but the belly fat did go away.  But the best thing I found by eliminating wheat was that my cravings went away also.  The Diet Coke and sweets that I never seemed to give up completely are no longer a problem.  But about the book.....it's boring reading but once you get to the do's and don'ts and commit, you'll find that saying no to anything not just food becomes easier.
B008BM9L72|4.0|The 50 Shades trilogy will never win an literary awards, but I found it to be basically a love story, with lots of kinky sex in it.  Apart from all the sex, the story line is a love story and the storyline was never boring.  I didn't think I would enjoy the books, but I did.  You need to read them for yourself to make up your mind about them.  The first book is very explicit, but I think the second and third books are more about the storyline rather than just the sex.
B008F5QQI2|5.0|George Michael, going through a few rough years personally, is BACK! He used the pain of the last few years to write a comeback record to re-launch a career on hold and help bring back old fans who have been awaiting his triumphant return. His pain and fear over the last few years is evident but coming back from near death, emotionally, has allowed him to use that pain to realize how precious our lives can really feel if we prioritize based on FEELING and LIVING LIFE instead of just surviving.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a well written \\"good read.\\"  It gave a lot of insight into the operation to kill Bin Laden, and i would recommend it to anyone who is interested in our efforts to reach out and eliminate those who bring war to our shores.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|This is a very strong Bey. Comes with the stronger launcher. It wins every time. My son loves it. Get some.
034580404X|5.0|I love the trilogy.  I ordered two sets.  I have read the trilogies at least 6 times.  It is the most beautiful love story.  Two persons who love each other so much; yet, they struggle to accept each other's individuality.<br /><br />I hope E.L. James does another similar book.<br /><br />This book should stand on its own.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game has got good graphics although many things look super-small on a Kindle Fire. Game play is a bit too simple for my liking I.e. I don't find it challenging enough.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am only about 30% into this book. Lots of twists and turns and things are never as they seem. Love it...thanks
B004OR1X6A|5.0|This is a schizophrenic release. From the studio, you get the unreleased first version of \\"Photo Finish.\\" As a longtime fan of Mr. Gallagher, I found it historically fascinating. But it's about the last thing I'd want to play for someone as an introduction to Rory. I couldn't find any song that I liked as much, much less better, than what became \\"Photo Finish.\\" Possibly for the title alone, but 'Brute Force and Ignorance\\" is one of my favorite Rory songs. He sleepwalks through it on this release. Still, it was all very interesting to hear these songs in their early incarnations.<br /><br />The real find is the live CD. I'll have to listen to it more but I think it just might be my favorite live effort from Rory. The band is incredibly tight and Rory is just smokin'. The call and response between him and bassist Gerry McAvoy is amazing. His slide guitar work, incredible. I think this disc just captures the joy that Rory carried on stage every night. Indeed, it's this live CD that gets the 5 stars.
0525953728|5.0|I thought it was very precise and easy to read, without a lot of personal interest stories.<br />It was mostly about the training and actual mission.<br />I would encourage everyone to read it, just so they realize what our military forces are doing and the sacrifice they go through.
B008383GE8|5.0|I am only halfway through and it was a real effort to put it down to write this brief review.  It is a wonderful book and for those that haven't looked into the night sky, I recommend this.  For those that have looked into the night sky and wondered, you need to read this book.
0307279189|5.0|OK, I may be late to the party, but I feel I have an important point to make about this book. It's very, very dangerous.<br /><br />It's likely that you're already a runner, if you're interested in reading \\"Born to Run.\\" So, you're probably already enjoying the rewards as well as the pitfalls of the running lifestyle: the crisp early morning runs, the thrill of race day, and the constant niggling (and maybe not so niggling) injuries that we just accept as a price for our passion. You may come to the book with little more knowledge than the blurbs on the cover or a friend's recommendation that it's an awesome book. So you dive in, and McDougall begins to spin his tale. The book reads like a 4-minute miler, and you find yourself engrossed in a story that just gets better and better as each chapter unfolds.<br /><br />Then, with subtlety and cunning, the author begins planting these notions in your head that maybe, just maybe, what you've thought about running, about YOUR running, has been wrong. That maybe those injuries that you have accepted forever might be your own damn fault, or, more specifically, Nike's damn fault. You begin to wonder, really really wonder, if perhaps this tribe of noble people have something to say directly to you about your own way of meeting the world, sole-wise.<br /><br />And before you know it, you've tossed your running shoes, and starting running in bare feet. Though you've been running for years, you start again, at square one, and learn a new way of running. And it's joyous and light, and you find yourself actually smiling when you run, and your legs tingle for hours afterward, and you decide that you'll never wear shoes on your run again.<br /><br />In short, the book changes your damn life.<br /><br />\\"Born to Run\\" is that kind of book. Well-written, passionate, intelligent, and thoroughly enjoyable. I read it twice, back to back, and still return to favorite chapters often. The cast of characters is terrific, the story unfolds at a wonderful pace, and the writing is solid. But I should warn you, and I think the publishers should too: this book will make you look at your running life in a very different way. It will make you want to run freely and with joy, to recapture that feeling that you had as a child when running was a spontaneous reaction to your place in the world, instead of something you endured to stay fit. It is a great celebration of running, and a cogent argument that we were built to be runners, that our place is on our feet, moving forward, and doing so with little to nothing on our feet.<br /><br />I loved this book. You will, too. But be warned: it could change your life. If it does, be sure to send Mr. McDougall your letter of thanks.wonderful pace, and the writing is solid.

B004R13U6Y|5.0|I use Foxit Reader on my desktop - it's free, it integrates perfectly with Firefox and, IMHO, it beats the pants off of Adobe Acrobat. So, when I needed a pdf reader for my Vizio VTAB tablet, the first place that I looked was Foxit, and they did, indeed, offer a mobile version. Then, I did what I usually do before I settle on a purchase - I checked the Amazon reviews.<br /><br />(By the way - a huge \\"Thank you\\" to everyone who takes the time to submit reviews; I think it's fair to say that, with them, I can't remember the last time that I was disappointed by a product that I purchased online!)<br /><br />ezPDF had the best reviews of all the available pdf reader apps, and that made it a no-brainer. While $2.99 is quite high for an app, on balance, I probably have 20 apps - mostly free ones - for which I've paid a total of maybe $6 or $7. For the amount of use I get out those apps, an average of 30-35 cents is a steal!<br /><br />The bottom line: ezPDF is everything that I need to have all of my professors' pdf documents  available whenever I need them, without having to lug around reams of paper. Spend the $2.99, balance the cost against all the free apps that you have, and you won't be disappointed!
0345803485|4.0|I purchased this trilogy because of the hype.  There is so much controversy circling these books that I had to read it for myself.  The first book had me disliking Christian Grey until the end.  However, it left me intrigued to read the next book, which I fully recommend.  I have fallen in love with these characters and their epic romance.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|There is more here than first appears.  Random attempts rarely gains success.  You must step back and think about it. No manual or instructions needed. Dont worry the game will provide many quick moments of fun while waiting in line or sitting in Mcdonalds. Enjoy and it was FREE or only. 99.
0525953728|5.0|this book provided a lot of insight  about the bin laden killing............it was fullof action and well written<br />I would highly recommend it
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This movie was no where near as good as the book, I would suggest reading the book first to get a real feel for the plot.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Obtained my first orange weapon offline at level 10 shivering isles, never paid for glue credits and ive beat the game in about 6 days, still fun to play on multiplayer and I love how I can play without wi-fi, in the later dungeons u can earn 3000~5000 silver in an hour, most bosses can kill you in 3-4 hits, blocking is your best offense. I have rated 4 stars due to occasional lagging when off-line, but it never lags when connected to wi-fi. Once you have unlocked spider den level 1 connect to multiplayrr and let them farm epic equipment for you if you have trouble.
0446573027|3.0|I really liked Baldacci in the past but this book got out of control.  It started well and actually held my interest up until the last 1/4 of the book.  Then it became just too incredible and into fantasyland.  The main character reminded me of a Jack Reacher type - military, super smart and deadly.  Maybe not so much of a coffee fetish.  Liked the West Virginia setting and characters, but the ending was terrible.  I did finish it since I had already invested my time.  Would not recommend this book unless you are really bored.
B007SGM084|5.0|The three books were great. I could not put it down until I was finished reading. My husband commented on how I constantly had my kindle fire with me at all times reading.

B00006F83Y|4.0|I know I know, it has couple of the most successful singles for this band but some songs I dont  know, I mean nick should not sing at all because he makes it sound like its a throwaway song ,  after a couple of listens it grew on me, but I like better every other queens record

0307383415|5.0|I have always been impressed by the President's talent for speech, but I am even more impressed with his writing! Especially when I realised that he wrote this when he was still quite young, long before he was well-known. A Tea-Party friend told me this book was heavy and depressing and would change my mind about Obama, but I must tell her now, \\"Au contraire!\\". I found the book to be deep, moving, interesting, witty, and downright fascinating. No, it's not light fluff, and thank God for that! My respect for our President has only increased now that I have read his own story in his own words. I love that he comes from such a diverse and colourful (no pun intended) background. That truly makes him a REAL American!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Although this game is not very exciting, it is really fun. Those who don't enjoy puzzles will probably not like this so much. I find it fun and interesting and a great way to pass the time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game or should I say games are so much fun... cant believe I didn't get it sooner. download it...its a must.
1847879071|5.0|I recently bought this book for a doctoral statistics course, and at first hesitate if humor that highlights the author would be of benefit. I have to admit that reading is easy to understand, the book is very strategically developed with real issues, practical and fun. The author provides short personal narratives through a different way of learning to use SPSS and interpret the material. I feel great organization containing chapters.
B008XG1X18|4.0|haven't had any major issues; although occassionally it doesn't want to load correctly. and I just close the app &amp; reopen it and have no problems.

B008MEM24S|1.0|so-so. its ok I guess but I would not recomend it if ur looking to have fun.... but I guess its not THAT bad...
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the original Frank L. Baum verison of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It's suprisingly adult reading for a children's book and contains both enough richness of prose and wit to keep even the most jaded grown-up entertained. It was also interesting to read the background that's only glimpsed in the movie and the differences between the print and film versions as well.<br /><br />A great light read - especially for free!
B008PE9GSA|2.0|Just like the Stones, ZZ kinda of lost me when they left the blues. Tres Hombres was the last album I totally grooved on. That kinda of boogie techno is tedious. I talk from experence, I bought their 1st pressing of their First Album in 1971. I was blown away...what a first album!!!
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Sometimes you are just in the mood for a light-hearted, romantic comedy and this was a decent pick for me.  A cute story, one I'd watch with my girlfriends on a Friday night, sharing a bottle of wine together.  If you are looking for something deep and meaningful, skip this one.  But if you want a good laugh and a little romance, I'd recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of the awesomest games I have on my kindle fire! I love all the action that goes on in the game you basicly have to just run, jump, and duck! fun and rash most of the time. :)(:
B00979OL5A|1.0|Save your money. Try the free version, if you find the movement as chaotic as I did, then uninstall it within five minutes as I did. I don't know about you, but I play games for entertainment, so when I start a game, I give it five minutes. This game has a frustrating and annoying movement interface! I gave it one star only because there is zero star option.

B003Y5H5AG|4.0|My family hadn't seen this yet, wow, very high energy. The first few minutes of the film I felt as though I were on a crazy train ride out of control..lol. But overall, a very cute movie and Hank Azaria is one of my favorite actors. The kids loved it.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|It's hard to express how amazing this little biography really is...first, it's a celebrity bio which is actually written by the celebrity himself instead of some ghost writer.  Second, this celebrity a heck of a writer.  Third, his subject matter (his life story) is tremendously engaging.  Throughout this narrative about his childhood in Glasgow, his struggles at school, his alcoholism, his recovery, and his climb up the fickle career ladder of Hollywood, Craig never seems to lose his compass.  He tells the unvarnished truth without self-indulgence or venality.  His voice is matter-of-fact, humble and extremely humorous.  It's a joy to read because you can feel his honest intelligence, his genuine gratitude, and his devotion to his family and close friends.  His story is about as real as gets, and it is profoundly touching without being one bit syrupy.  Highly recommend!

1606863622|5.0|I absolutely loved reading Dear John! It was a story that encouraged me to speculate and ask questions. It engaged my attention in a way that made me want to keep reading to figure out the answers and I even continued to speculate after finishing the story about what would have happened if it had ended differently. I knew going into the novel that I had a certain level of schema from other Nicolas Sparks books and movies, which helped me to understand the book and predict how I thought the book was going to end! It was a wonderful enjoyable story that made me laugh, cry, and engage in the lives of Savannah and John! I highly recommend!

0307744434|5.0|This is not just a book to be read, it is a book to experience. To delve into these pages is the epitome of what a story should do; transport you and make you feel.<br /><br />The feelings that I did have while enjoying this story: wonder, fascination, delight, longing, heartbreak and deep contentment.<br /><br />The Night Circus is told via an omniscient pov focusing on several characters and also interspersed with narratives that describe what you see and experience within Le Cirque des Reves (The Circus of Dreams). It seems to me that each person leaves the Circus somehow changed. Perhaps they come out believing that magic is real or perhaps they simply believe that it is real while inside the gates.<br /><br />The writing is poetic without being pretentious and it gave me not just a clear picture, but a clear emotion. I didn't just envision it, I was among the characters and within the setting, helped along by such phrases such as:<br />\\"But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves.\\"<br />\\"The air itself is magical. Crisp and sweet in her lungs as she breathes...\\"<br />There are several other gorgeous descriptions and lines, but I want you to discover them on your own.  Also, the writing and overall tone is so convincing in a gentle yet powerful way that events which occur written by someone less talented would not be believable.<br /><br />Did you ever go to a Renaissance Faire and at some point in the day feel like you're in a magical realm? A flute may be playing in the background or a costumed actor may walk by, but for that one moment, you are in another time. That is what Les Cirques des Reves is, a place where patrons explore magical and unique experiences, an illusionist, a hall of mirrors, a cloud room.<br /><br />The characters are vibrant and rich. From the main characters Celia and Marco to minor players such as Elizabeth, the woman who gives Bailey (another key player) ared scarf. Some motives are veiled until they fall together like a completed puzzle. My favorite character is Friedrich Thiessen, who is commissioned to make a clock for the circus and then becomes an ardent fan. There is nothing out of the ordinary about him except for his talent in clockmaking, but he is genuine and enthusiastic. When asked why he never asked for any inside secrets he replied, \\"I prefer to remain unenlightened, to better appreciate the dark.\\"<br /><br />The fans and followers of the circus are one of my favorite aspects of the story. They are called \\"reveurs\\" and they form a bond with each other through their love of the circus and their experiences. They kind of remind me of Dead-Heads who instead of a band, follow this special circus and collect mementoes, meet with other reveurs and reminisce, contemplate and discuss Les Cirque. They wear a touch of red to distinguish themselves and recognize each other, a red scarf, a red flower, a red ribbon. I've seen this group camaraderie at conventions I've gone to where people who may not see each other more than once a year form a special relationship united by a common love.<br /><br />One of the main themes in this book is magic. What is it? Is it real? What is happening as you step into the Circus? Are all these wondrous things possible? \\"Nothing's impossible.\\" Poppet says, who was born and raised in the Circus. You will get very interesting theories on the subject within the pages.<br /><br />The large clock that is displayed in the circus seems to symbolize another theme: time. The fates of the players, the duration of the challenge, the precision of the performances and the decisions that each character makes all depend on timing. The story also switches between two different (yet not so far apart) time periods and I could almost hear that clock ticking until the sand runs out and the events culminate in the final solution.<br /><br />This is the most beautiful, magical, creative story I've readin a long time and I will keep this on my bookshelf forever. I may have to start a reveur-like group for the book itself. Who's in?

0307949486|5.0|I read this because it was on my TBR pile for a long time and I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. I can see why this is an international bestseller as it has so many elements; intrigue, mystery, danger, great characters and complicated plot threads.<br /><br />There is a lot of telling in this book as it's an omniscient POV. I usually don't like being told what is going on, what went on, what people are thinking, etc. However, while I got a bit bogged down by all the finance talk, I didn't mind the \\"telling\\" as much in this book. The details are intriguing and although I may not have totally comprehended the content, it is written in a straightforward style.  I wanted to know everything that went on behind the scenes, from Mikael Blomkvist's relationships, to what led him on his chase of Wennerstrom  to begin with. Maybe it is also because it is just so well written and I knew that it had importance and I wanted to get as clear a picture as possible<br /><br />What I really loved is the detail that showed the investigation. Everything that Mikael and Lisbeth did to solve this mystery is given a lot of attention. There are no leaps or missing puzzle pieces. The only elements I wasn't clear about were the computer and bank transaction details, but that's just me.<br /><br />As I look back on the book I can't help but think that at times yet it was unrealistic, but at the time it was just exciting and I went along for the ride no matter where it took me.<br /><br />The most compelling parts are when Lisbeth comes on the scene. She is complex and abrasive, but very sympathetic and not only did I root for her, I admired her. Her strength and cleverness feature prominently. It is no wonder she is becoming one of the most celebrated characters in literature.  Mikael is another character who is very likeable, heroic and vulnerable at the same time.  I felt that events happened to Lisbeth and Mikael and they both struggle in different ways to survive and overcome very different hurdles. When this unlikely team join forces it is a fascinating combination and they mesh well.<br /><br />I did enjoy seeing the characters come to life in the movie. Although of course they changed some things in the film, it didn't take away from the story or detract from the plot or mystery. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed the movie as much if I hadn't read the book because, of course, a lot is left out as it just simply couldn't be conveyed on the screen.<br /><br />This book does have explicit sexual content and violence so be warned if you are squeamish.<br /><br />And just a bit of trivia. Rooney Mara who plays Lisbeth is sisters with Kate Mara who plays Hayden on American Horror Story.y different hurdles.

030758836X|4.0|I was *very* excited to read Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl after loving her previous two books, Sharp Objects and Dark Places. I was a little surprised at the difference in terms of style and story, but not surprised at the way that Flynn weaves an insightful psychological thriller. Is she a writer or a pscyhologist?  Is she a psychologist or a mind reader -- delving into people's innermost thoughts and extracting them for analyzation?<br /><br />The pages flew by as I read about Nick and Amy, their romance and their marriage as they tell their stories. They are fascinating, FASCINATING, complex characters. They are reflective and deep and this is shown in their thoughts and behavior.<br /><br />The story at times mirrors the Scott and Laci Peterson saga, with a missing wife and a suspect yet charming husband. I love how Flynn puts a magnifying glass up to the media and to the public. One small misstep, one wrong word can be construed as proof of guilt.<br /><br />I kept guessing and second guessing and then guessing some more as I delved deeper into the couple's marriage, their memories, their opinions. I wondered if I could rely on any of the narrations, on anything that was presented to me. I worried about Nick and if he would go to jail for a crime he didn't commit. Because he couldn't have murdered his wife, could he? If so, then how and why? What led up to it? If not, then what happened to her? Who in Nick and Amy's life could have wanted to cause her harm?  I worried about Amy.  Was she dead?  When would we find out?  These questions had me turning pages late into the night.<br /><br />Part of me was frustrated with the ending, but I also feel that it was an interesting and logical way to end.<br /><br />What is behind their marriage, their troubles, their motivations is intriguing. It's a sad, spellbinding tale of wanting to feel loved, of revealing yourself, of psychopathy. Open it up and dive in.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I was pleased to find the blackberry messages sped up what could otherwise have been dreary reading. Good finish with Christian remembering - as a 4 year old boy and his meeting with Anastasia. All the pieces were rounded out and filled in. Enjoyable easy reading.
1572704497|3.0|What if someone outed a shameful secret that you held?  What would you do?  What if you were isolated with several other people and they started getting murdered?  Then what would you do?  This is what happens in And Then There Were None, basically a blueprint for many mysteries to come.<br /><br />Agatha Christie is an icon.  The name alone conjures up intrigue. Her many works gave birth to television shows, movies and contributed to the murder mystery genre.  Christie also wrote a play of the same title which was adapted into a movie that I saw when I was little.  This movie never left me.  So, I was pretty thrilled when I saw the audio book in the library.<br /><br />The problem for me in this book is the telling.  At the start it seems necessary to describe each character and how they are lured to Indian Island, but it is not engaging.  Also, the over explanation into certain people's thoughts did not grab me and the epilogue and finally the confession, while beneficial to the story was not appealing.<br /><br />The narration by Hugh Fraser was pretty good.  He has a very pronounced British accent and it was kind of amusing to me that such proper sounding speech is used to describe horrific crimes.  In other words, a very civilized voice talking about very uncivilized acts.  For the most part, the voices are distinguishable and while I didn't feel it the most inspired narration of a book, it did lend itself to the setting, the time period and the characters.<br /><br />Ten people are invited to an island under questionable circumstances and soon they are all accussed of being responsible for the death of someone (or more than one person).  Then one by one people begin to die.  Because I had seen the movie, I was pretty sure I knew who the killer was unless of course the movie was different than the book which often happens.  It is different in a few respects, but the killer ended up being...well, I won't give it away.<br /><br />I love the way each death occured to reflect the nursery rhyme about 10 little Indians and the plot device of having one of the 10 figurines disappear each time someone got killed.  All the while there is confusion, suspicion and helplessness at being trapped on an island at the mercy of a deranged murderer.<br /><br />Each character is so different that it wasn't difficult to keep track of all the players.  The only ones that I kept interspersing were the Judge and the Admiral.  Perhaps because they were both older and the voices seemed similar to me.  I really enjoyed Vera's story...that backstory would have made an amazing novel.  To me, she is the most interesting character.  The way that Christie gave her history pieces at a time had me intriged with her.<br /><br />This audiobook is only 5 cds, so it was a quick \\"listen.\\"  Although I may not count this in a list of \\"must reads\\" I would put it in a list of \\"should reads\\" if for nothing else than because it was written by Agatha Christie, one of the most famous mystery writers of our time.to reflect the nursery rhyme about 10 little Indians and the plot device of having one of the 10 figurines disappear each time someone got killed.

0316212377|5.0|I do love the \\"Culture\\" novels. They represent interesting ways of looking at interactions of alien civilizations. And, of course, they feature the Minds... those AIs who make up the real power of the Culture. I have had many a good snicker or outright laugh at Banks names for the Minds (check Wikipedia for a list). The keen intellects have a taste for whimsy, but a very, very serious side as enforcers for the Culture, especially those associated with Special Circumstances. I am pleased that Banks spends more time now with the Minds. His earlier stories are quite good, but he really has been taking off in the last few books.<br /><br />My title refers to the fact that when I read some of the text, I hear the narrator from \\"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,\\" especially when Banks capitalizes words in sentences. For example I might write that the story revolves around A Really Big Secret, but when Banks writes something like that, you grin. (Well, I do.) Probably also has to do with Brit phrases creeping in now and then. All good with me. There is definitely a lot of humor in the book. Remember, Luke, Leia & Han in the garbage compartment? Banks goes one better (or should I say worse?) here, and it is perfectly plausible.<br /><br />The truth about composer's intent for the piece of music called \\"The Hydrogen Sonata\\" has such irony as to be both sad and terribly funny. Banks has a lot of nice touches in the book. But the book is, as my title indicates, mostly serious. The humor is secondary or tertiary.<br /><br />The book is a minor travelogue. Some very interesting places are visited. Imagine a race like McDevitt's Monument Builders, but building on a planetary scale. We visit an Orbital (a Ringworld type object), where in a remote desert section, an AI is building an analog to a waterworks... A place where some race drilled  holes through mountains to turn them into giant organ pipes played by the wind... A repository of a race's artifacts, including... no, you'll have to read that part...<br /><br />But there is this background of a race opting out of \\"The Real\\" to the \\"Sublime.\\" This is, in some ways like the transcendence in \\"Fire in the Deep,\\" but different. It is literally making a jump, as a race, to another dimension, where, to use the expression from another book, the individual minds (biological or AI) are \\"vastened.\\" Banks has mentioned the Sublimed before, but we get a little closer look this time around, just as in \\"Surface Detail\\" we got a look at \\"life\\" in a Virtual Reality.<br /><br />It's mostly a one-way trip. Supposedly everything is better... but is it? Communications with the Sublimed tend to be scarce. It's a definite \\"leap of faith\\" and our story takes place in the last 24 days before a race of humanoids (Gzilt) who helped found the \\"The Culture\\" (but who never joined it) takes the plunge to Sublime. By the way, Banks' choice of the the word Sublime is sublime!<br /><br />That's when a ship from the inheritors of a race who had left some of their technology to the Gzilt, shows up. And their message is that the main text that help guide the Gzilt in building their civilization was a fraud. Murder happens, and a cover-up is attempted... But those snoopy Culture Minds get wind, and want to know the truth... and off we go!<br /><br />Did I forget to mention that a very old humanoid, alive when the Culture was founded, is a key to the truth? Banks tries to address the question of how and more particularly why, someone would want to live that long (over 9000 years at the time of this book). There is some philosophical meat in the book, including the usual questions arising from making duplicates of one's self, and can one distinguish a simulation from reality.<br /><br />There is plenty of action and many more interesting ideas than I have yet mentioned. Readers of Banks earlier Culture books know how different the Minds can be from each other. It appears that not only can the Minds become eccentrics, but thatthey can \\"go native\\" with non-Culture civilizations.<br /><br />So many ideas! Banks reminds me why I fell in love with science fiction so long ago.
B001RUXW48|5.0|I really like this movie especially with the characters potrayed by DiCaprio and Crowe playing off each other. At times I didn't know if I could trust Crowe's character or any other character. I was going back and forth as to who to trust. Anyway, I particularly like this movie because my real-life Grand Daughter is in the movie as an extra. She is one of the soccer players.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|The title of the book attracted me because of my love of flower gardening.  The opening chapter was difficult and heart wrenching, so I decided to see how flowers and coming of age were linked.  This is as much a coming of age tale as it is a story of flowers.  The protagonist, Victoria, is a young girl who has been in and out of homes all of her life.  Potential adoptive parents kept taking her back to the adoption agency, because she was too difficult, didn't fit in with the family, couldn't make attachments, etc.  Through flashbacks we begin to get a sense of her journey through childhood and adolescence.<br /><br />As Victoria ages out of care by the state, she winds up sleeping in a park and planting a garden out of view of the public.  It is through her knowledge of flowers and their meaning that she is hired by a florist as an assistant. Her first real attachment begins with a study of the language of flowers through Victorian literature and Shakespeare's poems and plays, and when that is not enough, she and her friend go through old horticultural texts in the public library.<br /><br />This is a good book which will appeal to young women and gardeners of all ages.  Gardeners will enjoy the list of flowers and their meaning at the end of the book.

0316228532|4.0|I am a huge HP and JK Rowling fan.  But, I also read the previews and knew that this book would be completely different from HP. So, I went into it with an open mind.  If you are expecting typical JK Rowling fare, you will not like this book.  Most of the negative reviews appear to be from these type of people.  They also didn't give it enough of a chance.  It is impossible to accurately assess a story that you do not finish.  This is particularly true here.<br /><br />I loved Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but it took me about 1/2 of the first book to really get into it. The characters were confusing and difficult to sort out. Casual Vacancy is similar in more ways than one.  It is gritty and grim and uncomfortable to read, tackling issues such as abuse, neglect, mental illness, drug use, profanity, adultery and rape. (Also much like Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). It takes quite a while to figure out who the characters are and how they are connected.  It takes even longer to determine where Rowling is going with this story and why these characters matter.  The writing is excellent and descriptive which is what Rowling does best.  However, it also examines the worst of our human flaws.  Yes, all of the characters are flawed and, in some cases (not all as some reviewers would have you believe), unlikeable.  But, there is truth (authenticity!) in their behavior.  Even though most of us wouldn't admit it, who doesn't have gruesome fantasies such as those portrayed here?  Who doesn't think intensely uncharitable thoughts of friends and neighbors?  Rowling examines those character traits which none of us can deny but would like to.  I suspect those who give this book the most negative of reviews are those people who float through life with rose-colored glasses, refusing to look at hard truths and uncomfortable realities.<br /><br />On the flip side, not everyone likes to read this type of book.  Many people read to get away from reality and escape into fantasy.  Not everyonewants to be reminded of our shortcomings and the harsh realities of life in our free time.  I am one of those and, absent being written by JK Rowling, I probably would not have chosen to read this book on the basis of the story alone.<br /><br />With all of that said, I hope Rowling turns to lighter fare in the future which I think she does better.  She does try a bit too hard to make this the antithetical Harry Potter and I think the story suffers for it in places.  There is a whiff of trying too hard and it goes on a bit too long.  When you have characters such as these, we really don't need to get into their heads quite that much.  It is a scary and uncomfortable place to be.

B008I3R2VG|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the Killers previous albums, with Hot Fuss and especially Sam's Town being downright fantastic.  However, I have never been able to figure out what exactly their sound is, other than that they love stealing from popular 80s bands.  With Battle Born, they have actually merged together the Post-Punk/New Wave/Synth Rock of Hot Fuss, the Heartland Rock of Sam's Town, and the dance-inspired world-music pop of Day & Age.  I think the opening track Flesh & Bone might just sum up their entire career, and is a very invigorating song.  The verses of A Matter of Time even remind me of the dark, edgy rock of Sawdust (yes, their compilation of b-sides and rarities even had its own sound, at least for about two thirds of the album).<br /><br />Ultimately, this synthesis results in an album that surprisingly sounds consistent and flows from start to finish, despite the plethora of producers involved.  There are certainly standouts here:<br /><br />- The aforementioned Flesh & Bone<br />- The Tom Petty / Bruce Springsteen heartland rock of Runaways<br />- The borderline sappy (but surprisingly touching) balladry of Here With Me<br />- The pop anthem Miss Atomic Bomb, which starts off sounding like Human before careening into Read My Mind territory<br />- Be Still, where Brandon Flowers leaves his voice exposed throughout the entire song, and it is clear that his vocal lessons have paid off<br /><br />While these songs seem diverse, the downside of the careful merging of seemingly disparate genres is that the songs start sounding the same.  Or rather the heavy handed production gives the impression that they sound the same.  Again, it really is a surprise that so many producers were involved.<br /><br />Ultimately, this album shows that The Killers still have it, and have actually developed their own sound in the process, even if it does not rise to the heights of their first two albums.

0345505387|3.0|While the idea of a visual version of the Outlander was exciting I had hoped for a little more information in the story. I am a huge fan of Ms. Gabaldon and have read almost everything she has written so was anxious to see what this book entailed.  I'm not sure I liked how the artist portrayed the characters as this has now altered the Claire and Jamie I see in my own head. There was nothing wrong in how he portrayed them and he did it well but just not my vision. It was a fun piece of work, however.  Well done.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|It serves to protect my Kindle but it is truly annoying that the stand won't work. The slot for the stand is too wide and doesn't hold onto it. I would not reccommend it; especially for 30 dollars!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome I just got it and I already love it. one of my friends asked I they could play and they got mad when I said no.
1933865407|5.0|I have liked the Bruce Timm style of art ever since watching Batman the animated series nearly 20 years ago. This book is awesome to say the least. Even though it's a soft cover book, it feels very solid and printed on heavy paper. The content? purely beautiful works of art.<br /><br />For anyone who has seen Bruce Timm's character designs ( Batman, Justice League, Superman ... etc ) you will note a difference in the coloring style. While you're used to seeing these designs and characters in very cartoonish vibrant colors. The work in the book itself is different in that way as the characters are painted with more realistic shades of color, lights and shadows. It's a great book for anyone who is a fan of Bruce Timm's style of art.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|This novel is not up to Lee Child standards. The majority of the story line was descriptive scenery and travel log as the main filler for this novel. The plot was not only questionable but unrealistic. I reluctantly persevered throughout the entire novel. Maybe my expectations were too high based on his other nail biting story lines - but this was so bad - I'll have to think twice about buying his next novel.

0316228532|3.0|PRE-VACANCY:<br /><br />It is important to understand the history of an author's work before reading their new work, but since everyone pretty much knows the tale of Harry Potter and the tale of J.K. Rowling, it's a little redundant for me to dissect her career before getting into the meat of the review (and if she was less popular, I would do just that). But, I will--and I must--have a few brief words on the matter of Harry Potter. The Harry Potter series is when the planets align: a great author and a great story that kept on getting better and better. \\"Harry Potter\\" was fantastical escapism; \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is relentless realism--and at times laughable absurdity. Now, you must understand I'm not judging \\"Vacancy\\" based on her previous success; I'm judging Vacancy based on what it is.<br /><br />Now, I dislike teen fiction largely; I like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, and I like Clive Barker's Abarat series. That's it. So, trust me, when I heard that J.K. Rowling was FINALLY going to do an adult novel, I was PUMPED up, because I'm a reader of many genres of many eras and many authors. But, I was left feeling a little underwhelmed.<br /><br />THE CASUAL VACANCY:<br /><br />What I did like about the book was that J.K. Rowling, as a writer (as opposed to a storyteller), did take a lot of risks with style; I LIKE THAT. That's why Stephen King is my favorite author; for instance, J.K. Rowling, on occasion, will have a couple paragraphs between parentheses (truthfully the effect of the literary device may be \\"cool\\" coming from Rowling, but normally I wasn't impressed by the content of her style--in fact, sometimes it was pointless for her to even try. But I did respect her daringness.)<br /><br />On the flipside of liking her style, she has gotten into a weird habit with colons: you see what I did there? She does this a lot. The habit started sometime after \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" and before \\"The Deathly Hallows.\\" It's a little jarring sometimes because she should use a semi-colon instead of a colon; it makes more sense that way, but I think she just got so rich and powerful nobody will raise their voice and say, \\"Rowling, I don't get what you're doing with the overuse of colons.\\" But that's only a small gripe; it didn't affect \\"The Deathly Hallows.\\"<br /><br />The story does end up being very, very touching at the end of the book; but it takes a very, very long time for the multitude of storylines to gain momentum and meet up at appropriate parts. This book, in a way, is like a lot of British films: Death at a Funeral, Intermission, Trainspotting, Love Actually, etc. There are tons of small storylines that intermingle. What binds all the characters in this book? A death of a citizen in a small town: it happened in the prologue and from there on, J.K. examines their behaviors and what happens next.<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION:<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is stuck in between an awkward spot. You've got the Harry Potter fans who either a) jump on the bandwagon and are bitterly disappointed (and for good reason, mind you), or b) don't read the book,  because they're waiting to hear what other people have to say (which will be largely negative). The book is too slow-paced for young readers who only read flavor of the month books (like this book), and therefore, they'll buy it, get bored, stop reading; the book is too raunchy for \\"casual\\" readers like my mom or my dad (and with all the cussing, even if they did pick up the book, my mom wouldn't finish it). If you want a touching book which makes you feel something at the end, that's why there's Mitch Albom  (he's at least smart enough to make his books so short that even if you do grow bored, you could finish it relatively quick). I'm not opposed to books that are merely written to get an emotional reaction from the reader, even if the entire book is boring--\\"On The Beach\\" by Nevil Shute, case and point: I love that book. But \\"On The Beach\\" at least had a momentum from thevery beginning.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is rolling up hill until about the midway point. But, unlike some books where it feels like a rollercoaster is going up, up, up and down, in which the author is pushing you up, up, and up; \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is different in the sense that the reader is doing all the pushing, thinking to themselves, \\"Nothing is happening yet, I still don't know what the point of the book is, it's boring but something's going to happen, I know it; I have faith in Rowling, faith in Rowling, faith in . . .\\" That is literally the mentality I had while reading the book. It was exhausting! And I, on occasional, really like slow books (\\"On The Beach\\"), but there needs to be more payoffs throughout the book.<br /><br />Also, trust me when I say that I'm not holding Harry Potter on such a high pedestal that I can't forgive her writing a boring, adult novel; I'm one of those people who like Linkin Park when they changed their genre, so I am a very generous fan of the things I am a fan of--and I considered myself a Rowling fan (but I now realize that I was just* a Harry Potter fan, which is sad).  Sometimes artists have to change. J.K. Rowling clearly couldn't make another Harry Potter-esque series, so she wrote \\"The Casual Vacancy\\"--but it all seems a little too much of a forced attempt to escape Harry Potter.very beginning.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is rolling up hill until about the midway point.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Team of Rivals is a remarkable book about our finest President written by a wonderful author.  Mrs. Goodwin goes into minute detail about each of Lincoln's rivals for the 1860 Republican nomination and how each became a member of Lincoln's cabinet and how each came to admire and become devoted to Lincoln.  The reader gets to relive and understand the Civil War and the events leading up to the Civil War.  I highly recommend this book.  The reader will feel that he understands Lincoln and this important period of our history much better than before he read this book.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Let me just say, I love this game. I can't find anything wrong with this game. It's fun, compelling, and the sound track is great. This game would be a lot shorter if the heros just killed the bad guy instead of letting him live, though, which allows him to recover and terrorize once again.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is, without a doubt, the most beautiful and uniquely moving experience I have played. Journey is more than a cool video game. It is an EXPERIENCE! It is a true work of art. Trust me, there is nothing else out there right now that is like Journey. The other two main games in the package, Flow and Flower, are also interesting and unique, but Journey is in a class all it's own. Journey tells a complete story with no dialogue. The story is told through your own experience, and cryptic murals and glyphs that tell the story visually. Along the way you will probably encounter another stranger or two on their journey, as the game seemlessly drops other players into your game world if you are online when you play the game. Each time you play through the game is unique. The story leaves room for your own unique story to be projected into the game. The journey is about you, your life, your joys, your sorrows, your experience.<br /><br />The disc also contains a \\"making of\\" documentary on Journey, in which Genova Chen of thatgamecompany explains how he researched myth, symbolism, the hero's quest, and even universal dream imagery when designing the concept for the game.<br /><br />Journey is beautiful, mesmerizing, and moving! You can't miss out on this one. There is simply nothing comparable to this in the video game industry.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|A wonderful adaption by Amy to some amazing American classics. Best version of the Shirelles \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" I have heard.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow.<br />This book grabbed me from about the second chapter and I just could not put it down. This edition is a compilation of 5 shorter books. 1 set up an intriguing plot, 2 and 3 were interesting and well written, paced on the slower side with great, complex charaters. The forward motion slams into place toward the end of book 3.<br /><br />There were moments in book 5 I was actually holding my breath and paging forward to spoil myself because I couldn't stand to wait to see if the outcome would be good or bad.<br /><br />I'd compare this in pace and tone to The Hunger Games, and say it is 100% worth the read. For those who might ask, there is no content that would be inappropriate for teens to read (sex, language). The ideas are complex and unsettling, they really will stick with you.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it's ok. I just wish I didn't have to connect to facebook to advance in the game. hopefully this will hold me over till the real simcity 5 comes out in March.

0385344333|5.0|I note that some people did not care for this book.  But if you are a Jack Reacher fan, you will recognize this is one of his best.  From the time he hitches a ride in a car with the strange occupants, until Jack performs his own justice, he is the Jack Reacher we know and love, strong, rugged, smart and ruthless in his pursuit of what is right.  This time he is joined by an FBI agent who puts her career and life on the line to do the right thing.  Full of the twists and turns of any Reacher novel, it has a more realistic ending than other Reacher books.  To tell more would reveal the outcome.  Just know that on his road to Virginia, Reacher shows his old self in an even more engaging way.<br /><br />One bad note....at the end of the book, we are informed that Reacher will be played by Tom Cruise in the movie.  Either Cruise didn't do the casting or he has delusions of someting, because he can no more be Jack Reacher than Elton John can be. Update, I just saw a trailer for the movie.  Tom Cruise looks like a 12 year ols.  I think I will just stick with the book and my mental image of Reacher.

0525953728|5.0|Hey fellow readers!  Welcome to my first review!! I'll try and make this quick and painless...<br /><br />As a political junkie and Tea Party Patriot, \\"No Easy Day\\" was immediately per-ordered as soon as I heard about it.  I knew that the official account of what went down was not completely accurate, and I have to support a SEAL, so I bought two copies, kept one, and gave the other away.  WARNING: \\"No Easy Day\\" is a PAGE TURNER.  You will not be able to put it down until all the pages are fully absorbed, and then you will read it a second time.  Yes, it's that exciting.  There are several \\"holy c***, I have the chills\\" moments.  You won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend \\"No Easy Day\\".  Get one for yourself and one for a friend.
0525478817|4.0|This book was in the teen reader section of the bookstore, and I picked it out for one of my children. I ended up reading it myself -- in one evening. What the book has: Writing like this: \\"There are a number of ways to establish someone's approximate survival expectations without actually *asking*. I used the classic: 'So, are you in school?' Generally, your parents pull you out of school at some point if they expect you to bite it.\\"<br /><br />Also, metaphors. The book also has metaphors. The metaphors do bother some people, and they are sometimes heavy-handed, but they are always playful, and so you don't care. For example, the fact that Gus and Hazel go to Holland is a metaphor -- I'm guessing. There is an old essay written by a mother of special needs children that talks about how parenthood is supposed to be like going to Italy. You get all ramped up about going to Italy -- the sights, the food, the experience. Everyone else goes to Italy, too. But when you get off the plane, you find that you did not land in Italy, you landed in Holland. And you can't get to Italy, you have to stay in Holland. Raising children with special needs puts you in another country, an unexpected country, the essay goes -- not a horrible country, just a different one. The point of the essay is that you learn that there are great things about Holland, too, even if you don't make it to Italy.<br /><br />I'm presuming that John Green read the essay, and that these cancer sufferers are also in Holland, while the healthy kids get to live in Italy. The book is full of metaphor, and the book-within-the-book subplot is part of it, sure, but also makes the book more interesting.<br /><br />What else the book has? The book has real parents. I mean, as characters. They say witty things. This is a refreshing change from books where the parents are clueless dolts at worst and invisible at best.<br /><br />What the book does not have: Any real, apparent consequences of actually suffering from cancer. You know that the characters have cancer because the book says so. You know that the characters are dealing with the fact that they could die. I'm grateful that there is no Brave Cancer Sufferer here, but instead of offering up a different reality, Green sort of just mostly avoids the one we all just can't stand. Doesn't the medication have any side effects? Doesn't the prosthetic itch? Doesn't lung cancer cause wheezing, coughing (up blood?), chest pain? Hazel has lungs that do a terrible job of being lungs -- can there be a more terrifying feeling than that of suffocating? Probably, but you have to go rent the movie Saw to find out. The regular experience of that kind of trauma should leave some sort of footprint. Hazel is a teenager -- in a wonderful place. What happens when she misjudges her stamina and finds herself gasping for breath? While as a reader I'm desperately grateful that there is no Sappy Sweetness, or Heroism in the Face of Pain, Green missed an opportunity.<br /><br />Obviously, too much gritty realism and the book changes into something else entirely -- risking, in fact, becoming exactly what Green is trying to subvert. But Hazel is dying of cancer -- and so the cancer should have been more present. Showing these adolescents responding to weakness, pain, and the ugly reality of cancer -- in the way that these two bright, brave, interesting adolescents would have -- would have made this a better book.<br /><br />What the book has makes it worth reading. It's good, solid, intelligent fiction. It could have been literature.
B005P58PIO|5.0|I really really love this show. Plot is interesting, never boring or repeating itself. Characters are well developed and never monotonous.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Contrary to many reviews of the film, I felt that this movie is mainly about old age and retirement in western societies today in the context of the changes brought about by globalization. The film has a great cast of elderly English actors such as Judi Dench and Bill Nighy and the story line is pleasant if not gripping.<br /><br />A group of retired English people decide to move to Jaipur in northern India for various reasons, but primarily financial ones. The film is about their encounter with India which is told in an engaging manner. India, with its color and people, also turn out to be a significant actor in the film.<br /><br />I won't go into the story as it has been told in many other reviews. What I found interesting was the idea of changing times in Britain today and its impact on the elderly. Unlike the past, the welfare state is slowly being chipped away in the era of globalization, leaving elderly people now waiting for six months to get a hip replacement and others not being able to lead a comfortable living with the money that they have left in retirement. The movie dabbles with the idea that perhaps senior people may be better off moving to foreign lands where their pounds and dollars go a lot farther. It suggests that even though they will have to come to terms with substantial cultural shocks initially, it is worth the effort and that it is never too late to learn to effect a change in one's life. Since the era of baby boomers is reaching the retirement age, this is a very relevant and topical film because baby boomers also have been adventurous travellers to the east in their twenties. So, they may be well equipped to implement the message of this film.<br /><br />The film has got its usual cliches about untouchability in India, the squalor and poverty of India as well as race prejudice among the older generation of Britain. But overall, it is a feel-good film and treads lightly on the negatives of its characters. It is enjoyable to watch.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|The acting was good. The special effects were great. The story was hard to follow. It seemed like they cut out some key scenes and dialogue along the way. It was overall entertaining, but not one I'll remember or want to see again.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I found the book readable, but the book overall lacks<br />sophistication. My personal opinion is that the<br />book was written for teenagers.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|The easiest book review to write is a really negative one.  Next in line is a Five Star. This is neither.<br /><br />To write a bad review, all you have to come up with are put-downs. True or false--makes no difference.  If they sound provocative, they'll do. They are good-copy.  Just like gossip, a bad review will find readership.  In fact, negative ads get the most recognition.<br /><br />So in considering a review of \\"The Secret\\", I decided to review my life objectively in relation to when I used The Power of Attraction in my life--with what results.<br /><br />Number 1 - Me--I did not come from a dysfunctional family.  But neither of my parents were positive thinkers either.<br /><br />Looking back, I realize I must have acquired some degree of The Power of Attraction (I firmly believe there is such an animal whether naysayers want to admit it or not) by osmosis. I can see where I used the Power of Attraction in many life building moments: choosing a college, a spouse.  Moving from a 600 square foot Levittown-variety house when we first married and in three years buying a 1500 sq. foot brick home in a neighborhood that boasted three doctors on our block. And moving up from there--well up.  In jobs, in friendships, etc.<br /><br />But there have been some pratfalls along the way.  When I read and watched \\"The Secret\\", I finally realized that the times when I \\"lost it\\" were those when I did not take time to feel Gratitude. \\"The Secret\\" opened my eyes.  I learned a lesson I will never forget.<br /><br />Number 2 - Individuals I consider a success.  (And I must emphasize here, my evaluation of a person's success often includes, but never limits that success to financial.) I determined successful people come from two backgrounds--families who are positive thinkers--95%.  And those who came from situations where the observer would say, \\"There's no hope.\\" But cases where the individuals said, \\"I can.\\"  My conclusion was obvious.  People who expect to succeed do.  The lucky ones are guided by those who learned The Power of Attraction (by any name you might want to give it).  The even luckier few are those who refuse defeat and search until they find their success.<br /><br />Yet, I had two criticisms of \\"The Secret\\".<br /><br />First was the supposition that all physical ills and aging can be improved by accessing The Power of Attraction. After all, life is finite. Yet, I have seen faith heal. So attracting healing must be possible. Then I realized, \\"The Secret\\" does not say there is no death.  It simply showcases people who have used The Power of Attraction to solve a physical problem.<br /><br />Second--I did not remember spirituality being considered in the directions of accessing The Power of Attraction--and I believe in spirituality. So I went back to \\"The Secret\\", randomly opened it, and I there right in front of my eyes I saw two Bible quotes: Matthew 21:22 and Mark 11:24.  And I remembered...  In 2007, I personally used Mark 11:24 as my primary affirmation in solving an extremely serious personal problem, one seemingly unsolvable.<br /><br />Currently, I am in a phase of my life where The Power of Attraction is, if might I use a pun, very attractive.  I have goals I want to reach--and difficulties I need to surmount. It would be easy to feel sorry for myself (even my husband says I'm working too hard).  I know that route would accomplish nothing.<br /><br />So, by using the tools shown in \\"The Secret\\" to my advantage, I will move forward. I have nothing to lose but other people's skepticism.<br /><br />In conclusion, it seems the reason The Power of Attraction is \\"The Secret\\" is because so few people are willing to realize that sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.<br /><br /> I believe.ucky ones are guided by those who learned The Power of Attraction (by any name you might want to give it).

B005PR422K|4.0|If you're looking to start your own business and want to learn how to do it effectively whilst minimizing your costs and making the most efficient use of your time, this book will tell you how to do exactly that.<br /><br />Eric's background is in the technology field, so if you're looking to start in that area this will be perfect. However, what Eric teaches can be applied to all business sectors and he provides many examples of this.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I downloaded this app while on business trip because I was afraid I would oversleep.  I didn't really trust the alarm in the room and hate wake-up calls, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It works!  It woke me every morning without fail, allowed me to snooze (and set the length and duration of my snoozing), and pulled directly from my selected playlist so I could wake to my choice of music.<br /><br />I suppose it could drain your battery, my first generation Kindle Fire is notorious for short battery life, but I manage this by just plugging it into the charger. Does not drain the battery, and I'm always charged and ready to go in the morning!<br /><br />All-in-all,  a great clock that works and looks fantastic.  The ads are unobtrusive. I say get this if you want to wake up to your own tune at home or on the road.
B008MEM24S|1.0|such a copy. either wheres my water, or wheres my pery. waste of space on &Agrave;NY device! dont waste your money... save it for something worthy
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|There are lots of long-winded reviews out here to tell you all the ins and outs of the movie so I'm not going to repeat any of that.  I'm adding my review to tell you that it is well worth the money to buy the 3D Combo pack, grab a bucket of popcorn, press play and hope your face doesn't crack from the big grin that shows up and stays for the entire movie.<br /><br />Aside from a great \\"feast for the eyes\\" 3D presentation, the extras (regular Blu-ray version, DVD version and digital version for both movie and Avengers Assemble album) show that the folks went all out to provide a great experience on this one.<br /><br />I am a super hero nut so I was expecting great special effects, but what I wasn't expecting was to be so totally entertained by almost every other aspect of this movie and extras.  But, don't take just my word for it.  Even my better half (who isn't a Superhero fan) said this one \\"held my attention better than the Fantastic Four and seemed more believable from a human (or super human) interaction standpoint\\".<br /><br />This one is worth getting all the bells and whistles.  Highly recommended.
B004GYY714|5.0|this is the most useful app I've ever had. I love it! I always listen to it, it has so many cool features. &lt;3
0142421375|1.0|I picked up this book at an airport, not knowing that it is targeted at younger readers. (As I am now assuming.) I thought it started out pretty well; believable characters, interesting starting point. But I was severely disappointed in the plot. Not to give things away for those who have not read it yet, but I am used to a bit more layers when reading a John Grisham. A bit more below the surface, so to speak. I thought this plot was quite shallow and I kept turning pages thinking 'Now it must be coming, the thing-I-did-not-see-coming.' It did not.<br />No more Theodore Boone for me, and no John Grisham either, I think, certainly not the very thin ones as this one is.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I played this so I had something to do ratherthan watching football. I bate football the game was interesting I really enjoyed it
B002UXRGM0|5.0|The photography is fantastic, as you would expect from this BBC production, and it is topped off with the voice of the best Wildlife commentator of all time, David Attenborough.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|I love this album when I was in High school (in the 1970s and the album is still great.  Harmonies, melodies, lyrics, all make for a great , creative effort. Just a great album. Of course not quite the same, but I look forward to seeing them in November on Long Island.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its not like I'm going to jump off of a cliff because I'm so happy with the app, but it runs nicely.<br />I like the app better than using Pinterest on the computer. much easier to navigate and pin. woo hoo.
141694737X|5.0|We recieved this book as a gift for my daughter's first birthday.  My daughter loves the book so much she plays with it every day, saying the names and sounds of the animals.
B0058VW36U|4.0|i played this game on my moms iphone i love it so does my little sister she even sometimes thinks it is her game.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Bought this for my mother in law. She went to see this movie a while back and loved it and stated at the end of the film she NEEDED this for her movie collection. Bought it for her birthday. She was v v happy with this. Good movie. Worth buying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great product for the price!! I would love to order more but they were out of stock when I went to order alot of them.  I was only allowed to order 3.  Although I have not mounted them outside yet but they look great.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have no problems with this ap. I use it everyday. I love cresting the multiple boards. its very easy to use
B00770KR7W|5.0|I got this figure along with the other series, note, I'm a huge halo collector and I don't open most of my figures. But I can still manage to see the detail on it.<br />That being said. I bought the figure and after looking at it for a few hours, it went up on my shelf. A few days pass, I'm on the internet searching for halo news, and 343i had just released a vidoc about the master chief, so of course I watch it. In the video they talk about the chiefs armor detail, now in the official video game trilogy. Master Chiefs Spartan number is not anywhere on his armor, but in the extended universe he has a huge 117 painted on his chest plate. To my surprise in Halo 4 they gave him 117 on his chest, but in braile... So I think to myself, I wonder if the figure has this new detail too. And what do you know, it did!! I went crazy, that alone made me like the figure so much more.
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game ever!!!! When you are bored this is the game to play. I love trying to meet all my objectives!!
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|Who doesn't love the warthog? If you speak halo vehicles it will def be brought up, synonyms with halo like the assault rifle or grunts.<br />This set is amazing. I only own two other warthogs previously released for mega bloks and this one by far kicks it out of the park. It's a little bit bigger than the other warthogs, the detail to it is amazing. The other hogs look like halo 2, while this one does it justice and looks like halo 4 if we were speaking in comparison to detail. Of course you get the new mold for an elite which is awesome and two new molds for Spartans. Now with this new line of mega bloks they've been releasing forerunner sets included with the hog. At first I dismissed it. But as I got to the end of the instructions manual it said that this forerunner set could be combined with another forerunner set from the battlescape III set to make a building that looks like the first iconic forerunner structure you first encounter on the ring world, if mega bloks keeps doing that it will make buying sets as a group more interesting to see what else we can combine and build.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Awesome game! I'm spending way too much time playing it! ;) it's just like that quarter game I loved from the fairs.
B006DICWUE|2.0|After coming so far, didn't get it done this time around and I was so disappointed! I even tried multiple listens to see if it would grow on me and it didn't whatsoever.  Nada Surf has been a band that has come so far after so many years as a group.  When I purchased High/Low, I didn't think it was great album but I could hear the potential that they had.  That to me was realized after the Proximity Effect and peaked with the critically acclaimed \\"Let Go\\" which was a pretty strong album from top to finish.  In fact the bonus tracks on that album were even better then some of the songs that came off the album. So if you are in the hunt, make sure to get this one with the bonus tracks.  You can also find strong stuff on Lucky or \\"Weight is a Gift\\" however this latest offering was often boring and abysmal.<br /><br />As you put your CD/LP or Digital copy in and press play you get the first track and I was surprised at Clear Eye Clouded Mind.  It sounded a little reminiscent of the Nada Surf of when they first started in which they were adequate at best and trying to find their way.  For me, it was a bit of a throw back but I was not blown away or anything.  It was just there.<br /><br />The next track was \\"Waiting for Something\\" and indeed I was doing just that. The fact that they only put out 10 songs when you usually get much more material made me anxiously waiting for this to pick up.<br /><br />Then they came on with When I Was Young. I didn't care for this track at first as I found a little slow but this one you need to listen to as it builds from start to finish.  There is a lot of different of things going on musically in this song so if you are a band person like me its fun to go back and pick out what was going on throughout. It shows they spent a lot of time on it.  It was a good, solid track but I wasn't blown away by it and I was much  more optimistic as Nada Surf usually keeps their better stuff later in the album.<br /><br />Jules And Jim - To me the besttrack on the whole album.  This didn't have all the extras like \\"When I was Young\\" but it didn't need it.  They added to the percussion section and added Bells or some type of Xylophone that resembles bells and that was all this track needed to compliment the whole song! Once again it was a good song but it's not like it made my top 10 list of Nada Surf Songs or anything.<br /><br />Then we get to.... Well, I don't know what was next unless I went and actually looked at the song booklet.  The rest of this album I found my self constantly pushing the next button.  I even forced myself to listen to them all uninterrupted and I still was waiting for the songs to end.  There is a track that has a nice guitar opening but once everyone kicks in I was disappointed in it still.<br /><br />So then I was like, maybe I missed something and Nada Surf has compelling lyrics like they do in most of their songs and this will want me singing along.  The album's lyrics are full of unanswered questions and I have never seen so many question marks in one lyric booklet before.  It's formulaic and monotonous if you read it from start to finish.<br /><br />By the way, can someone please tell me who Doug Gillard is and why he is listed as Lead Guitar?!<br /><br />So with thing ending with \\"The Future\\" I was not looking forward to Nada's if this is their direction.  I am hoping they were fulfilling a contract or something and they are going to come back rejuvenated.  This didn't feel like their best efforts and while I did enjoy two tracks, I cannot give this a recommendation.  Even the best have their bad moments so I will wait and purchase the next one as always. If you are new to this band go back and listen to \\"Lucky\\", \\"Let Go\\" or \\"Weight is a Gift\\" for some awesome stuff.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|So many twists & turns--so good that I immediately bought another book by this author. There was never a dull moment--impeccably crafted.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Plays like my previous Fishdom game I played years ago on my Pc.  Works fine on my Kindle Fire &amp; pay upgrade easy without loss of progress.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I almost did not buy this book because of the damning reviews but I am glad I did.<br /><br />Like all of Lee Child's books I did not want to put it down. I think Child has done a masterful job of doing it just a little different but still in character with Jack Reacher and as usual clever characters in law enforcement that you can easily imagine from his words.<br /><br />Well done Lee Child. I was once a fan of Clive Cussler but his books became clones of each other, almost written to a standard recipe and true artistic talent shows when you can mix it up and be different each time.<br /><br />I think all the naysayers here should probably just grab their favourite Reacher novel and read it over and over again as obviously variety is not appreciated but I say again, well done Lee Child, keep em coming!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|just simply fantastic.  wish I had found this years ago.  turns my phone into an &quot;electronic sword&quot;....yep, It's a &quot;light saber.&quot;<br />seriously, I am able to take it anywhere.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|Yet another musical exploration by the talented Maynard Keenan of Tool and A Perfect Circle fame. This album stands above the rest of the cookie-cutter imitative music that is common among this generation. Puscifer's music is innovative, creative, and a great listen for fans of any genre of music. Absolute genius.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|Maynard is one of the most fascinating people in the public eye, and seems to follow his own truth and let the world work itself out. He is great at being tongue in cheek and serious at the same time, and does it all with good and interesting music.
0316228532|1.0|I wanted to like this book. I wanted the writing to be just as page-turning as the Harry Potter books. I figured JK Rowling's writing style wouldn't change a whole lot just because it changed age levels, but I was wrong.  DEAD wrong.<br /><br />As a stand-alone work, this is just trash. Ok, I expected there to be more sex, more filthy language and such than in HP, but it does't add at all to this story, and doesn't add interest whatsoever.  I found myself squirming uncomfortably when reading the first few chapters.  I kept reading, hoping it would suddenly change and get better, more interesting, less trashy, less vulgar, but it didn't.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that this is the same author who wrote the HP series.  Where is the finess? Where is the mystery? Where is the wonder?<br /><br />Apparently it vanished with Hogwarts. :(
B004TACMZ8|3.0|I bought it from Home Depot today and compared it with Zircon i520. It is not any better than Zircon. Zircon's screen is easier to see and easier to understand. With this one if you look at it from above or at eye level you do not see it well. You have to look at it from below.And it is more expensive than Zircon.
B004XCFR40|4.0|I have read \\"Airs above the ground before\\" and so of course I like it. It is rather exciting but not scary, and like all the books by Mary Stewart when you've finished it it feels as if you been on trip. Should you travel to the place where it was cast (in this case Austria) you feel you've been there before. Seen some of the sights, tasted the food etc.<br />I don't think it is for men and perhaps not the younger generation. I have 3 daughters, one of them loves Mary Stewart the other 2 are indifferent.
B004YM6JLO|3.0|I thought the first two seasons were great.  I'm not that crazy about the third.  Would probaly rate it five stars if not for the fact that there is more gore which to me isn't necessary, the \\"love scenes\\" are nothing but couples jamming themselves up against walls with heavy breathing (sounds like they're in labor) and mashing their faces together.  Someone yodeling a song every five minutes is distracting and annoying.  Plus always the same scenario - a school or town party where someone gets maimed or killed, (then comes back to life with a big gasp) slammed up against something - same-o, same-o.  Think the writers are running out of ideas.  Will be very surprised if it goes to a fifth season.
B0083EW97W|4.0|I was/am hesitant to give this album a fair shake because I thought after \\"where the light is\\" he'd continue in his blues heavy approach or maybe go more into jazz guitar like the stuff he did with Chris Botti.  But he's an artist and of course is free to do what he wants. Its a good album so far my faves are Age of Worry and If I ever get around to living. There's this break where he just repeats a vague but potent phrase \\"when you gonna wise up boy\\" over a pretty mellow guitar line. Long story short I'm glad I bought it.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I've read the comic and this adaptation is almost as good as it gets.  I have no reservations in recommending this movie to any Batman fan.  The fight scenes are fantastic!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Great product! I absolutely love The Walking Dead show, so this was a no brainer to buy. Figure was slightly larger than I expected, which was great. Fantastic detail, and the fact it COMES with Season 2 on BluRay, it's a steal!
B00377V6J2|5.0|Great CD/DVD combo for the price showcasing 2 of my fav bluesmen jamming 2gether. Been playing it on cd repeat! Get it if ur a blues fan!
B008RV5K4U|1.0|completely disappointed...need to state animated somewhere in the title. I would have never purchased had I known it was this type of movie.
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|pretty fun game. worth the free download.  not exceptional. the game asks for reviews in order to unlock new features.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Always thrilled when a new Jack Reacher thriller by Lee Child is released!  And I was disappointed.  Excellent read that was hard to put down.  Plausible mystery that really makes you think about what is going on in the world currently.  I'm thinking it's going to take Reacher a few more books to get to Virginia..it's taken a few books already and he still has a ways to go!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Excellent movie which has all the right ingredients: beauty, fun, magic, a good story, interesting characters played by wonderful actors,... the list goes on.... and something to think about after the final frames.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I kinda like this game. There are prizes to collect and puzzles to finish. Special coins give various prizes as well. The only thing I don't like is the slow coin regeneration. If you let the game sit idle, you get 1 coin every 30 seconds. If you close out the game, the coin regeneration is something like 1 coin every 9 minutes. It also won't let you accrue more than 50 coins offline. You can purchase extra coins, but to me this is a huge waste of money. To each their own, I guess. If you want, you can sell the prizes you collect for extra coins. For a free app, it's worth the download!
0525953728|4.0|The book is well written and almost an addition to \\"Seal Team Six.\\" Too much of the book is in SEAL training, only if the reader has read other SEAL books. Specific operations and the Osama bin Laden strike was very interesting. Potential conflicts with the White House and Pentagon might be a confirmation of some of operating procedures. However, the last few chapters are likely the reason for objections by the White House as the disrespect and dislike of the President by the men are discussed. The major problems are the fears come true of the President announcing the operation for political gain and the phony political dispay by the President for the Armed Forces. It's a good read.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I have a set of Black Box programmable professional walkie talkies that use software to change the frequencies.  They interface to a computer via a RS232C Serial Connection.  That worked great for  years until my computer died and the new one didn't have a RS232C port, only a ton of USB Ports.  I could have spent money to have my computer updated with a RS232C port, but because my computer also serves as my security system, I really didn't want to take it out of commission.  So, after purchasing this USB to Serial Converter, I must say with my set up everything was plug and play.  Although there are drivers with the converter, and a website you can download drivers, the Plug and Play software works great.  On the first try I was able to connect with my radios, view their configuration and program new frequencies.  I simply plugged in the converter into the USB Port, my computer automatically detected the device and downloaded the correct software.  Then I plugged in my radio, & launched the Black Box radio application.  The software read the current radio configuration just like it would normally do with my old computer.  This truly was much too easy!  Now the only thing to do is think about what else I can do with the two hours I set aside for this project; I know... Write a Review! 5 stars!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is a great collectible piece! It serves as part Halloween decoration as well as an ice breaker while sitting on to of my DVD rack. Love the Walking Dead series!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I DL lots of books from my library through Amazon. I bought this<br />USB cable from Amazon and was amazed how easy it was to install.<br />I plugged it in and off I went. No fuss, no muss! Great<br />product.
B005R32L66|4.0|The product works quite well.  I am a healthcare consultant so I am often away form my family, but with this product on my phone it is easier to keep in touch.
0316228532|4.0|Does this sound about right? \\"Rowling's refusal to conform to happy endings demonstrates the fact that The Casual Vacancy is not meant to be entertainment. She wants to deal with real-life issues, not the fantasy world to which women writers are often confined. Her ambition is to create a portrait of the complexity of ordinary human life: quiet tragedies, petty character failings, small triumphs, and quiet moments of dignity. The complexity of her portrait of provincial society is reflected in the complexity of individual characters. The contradictions in the character of the individual person are evident in the shifting sympathies of the reader. One moment, we pity Stuart, the next we judge him critically.\\"<br /><br />Actually, that's a summary of Eliot's Middlemarch with a few names and tenses changed (actual quote at SparkNotes dot com's website). Some online reviewers, especially those who read the free previews, have rated this book low on Amazon and elsewhere and stated that it was boring so they did not continue. These reviews may be translated as \\"tl;dr\\" comments. The readers might say the same of Middlemarch.<br /><br />Many of the early professional reviews also seem to me to miss the mark, perhaps because the reviewer had to read the book in a few hours with a phalanx of Little, Brown lawyers on hand. They seem to have skimmed for easy quotes and have missed much of the context that situates what they've plucked from the text. Like some of the the sample-only readers, they have not taken the very obvious cues of the novel's opening that it will build gradually. Unlike the Harry Potter series, this is not action/adventure, or even mystery.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy indeed starts slowly. Because the novel at first presents itself as a comedy of manners, it's no surprise that Rowling takes some time to introduce the large cast of characters as they first react to Barry's death. While most people are initially socially appropriate (at least in public), the death inspires both noble and self-serving thoughts. Like the people of Pagford, the reader only discovers these aspirations and interpretations as the story and relationships unfold. The vacancy left by Barry turns out to be anything but casual.<br /><br />We see families interacting with their members and with other families. The genre gradually shifts to become more plot- and action-driven as thoughts become deeds, sometimes not for the better. The reader sees several slow train wrecks in the offing as events inexorably roll on.<br /><br />This is not a happy book, and it is not uplifting. Most of the characters are unlikable, though as their stories unfold, their complexity in some cases increases the reader's sympathy and identification. There is a great deal of swearing, shagging, smoking, and drug use (none of which would have been particularly shocking from another author). There are many mean, small-minded acts. Yet none of this is glamorized (most of it falls in the faintly absurd to somewhat gross spectrum), and it is matched by many characters' sad evaluations of their own relationships, longing to be closer to (or farther from) other people, agony over acne and hair, helplessness, and fear. People wish they had each others' families. Triangulation, insults, secrets, and violence occur behind closed doors. Rowling realistically depicts pettiness, teenage angst, teen and adult posturing, and the sometimes stifling and intrusive nature of small towns and their politics. It is like being at your social services job day and night. It is depressing. It is also very funny, though this is only occasionally presented in character's actions and is more frequently evident in surprising adjectives, comparisons, or characters' thoughts that veer from what is expected. There are, though, events that are deeply, wonderfully absurd, and all the more so for the earnestness and self-absorption with which they are enacted.<br /><br />Grief is a constant theme--grief forlost people and lost opportunities. Rage, both acute and simmering, appears time and again. The major actions catalyzed by Barry's death and its initial implications can be characterized as The Long Secret meets anti-Potter. What happens when teenagers take matters into their own hands? Generally speaking, the outcome is not good. Where Harry saves his world, the adolescents of Pagford destroy it. Most of the adults, who strive to assuage their inchoate longings with gossip, sexy boy bands, and reading posts by Barry's ghost, and who regularly misinterpret motives and are often wounded by each other, are no better or more mature. More complex than Harry Potter, this story ends without tidy wrap-ups, and more like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The ghost indeed exacts his due, though Jesus-like Barry might be horrified by this misuse of his legacy.<br /><br />Barry's saintliness probably would have showed more tarnish had he been alive and present through the book; he serves as a symbol of, among other things, the other characters' longing for a Jesus-like figure to hold their need for absolution. However, redemptions are few and far between, with the only unequivocal example being the river-dunking of Sukhvinder Jawanda.<br /><br />A few criticisms:<br /><br />Like the Harry Potter series, this is structured as a chiasmus. The reader who guesses or observes this may find the events of the end of the book too predictable.<br /><br />After the second incident, the third time a teen trashed an adult online seemed reductive and mechanical.<br /><br />While I'm not familiar with UK law, I will imagine that had Parminder Jawanda aided Howard during a medical emergency, she would have been in the clear. Why Kay would violate a client's confidentiality several times, with no consequences, I cannot say, but it seemed like an easy way for Rowling to share information without straightforward exposition.<br /><br />Exposition is one of Rowling's stylistic weaknesses in Harry Potter, and there was still much telling rather than showing here. However, The Casual Vacancy is an improvement. Characters have more interiority, and even though this sometimes has the feel of interior exposition (as when Fats ruminates over an \\"authenticity\\" most reminiscent of Sartre's Nausea), there is somewhat less told about the characters by an impersonal narrator. The shifts of perspective throughout the novel contribute immensely to Rowling's ability to give us characters in action rather than words about characters and pronouncements about their actions. In this regard, it's better than Harry Potter.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|find myself playing it more than I should! not getting much house work done. should make sure you have time to spear,  you wont want to stop.
1439170916|5.0|The author reminds me of another physician who found his forte in writing (though the other one dropped out of medicine and excelled at science fiction, much of which went on to the big screen).  The information was thorough and easily understood.  And the stories of both patients and researchers were so beautifully told.  I hope the author stays in medicine and continues to write, also (in his spare time).
B004VMUS9G|1.0|it drains your battery and isn't loud. and sometimes doesn't go off. or kills your battery and you don't hear the alarm,  just don't trust it.
1455502758|5.0|Definitely worth it to buy this book. It is real, well written and a great short read. Worth picking up and having on your bookshelf to go back to every so often.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|After a recent divorce, I was having a heck of a time falling asleep.  I was in a bad sleep pattern and needed help getting back to a normal sleep pattern.  I use the ocean waves, distant thunder, and wind chimes at night to help me fall asleep.  Within a couple of weeks, I'm back to normal sleep and I credit this app with being a big part of it.  I truly enjoy the sounds.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It is ideal for when you are use to some kind of background noises of a city or country and unable to hear it. Like myself when I am aways from home it gives me the noise that I am use to when I am home.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A Jack Reacher book is always a fast ride with interesting characters and well thought out plots.  This was no exception but not my favorite.  I look forward to anything Lee Child writes and am never disappointed.  I hope Reacher lives a long time!
B00913DPW2|5.0|This is my first time to review and app and I'm doing so because it is simply the best app I have ever played.  There is no delay between scenes, the music is creepy (as it should be in a game called the haunt, the graphics are great, it takes a while to play, the puzzles stumped me but most are solvable on your own, and it has a built in hint option to help.  My only complaint is that the second isn't out yet!!!!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie which is why I was so disappointed when I finally did.  The story line didn't flow as it jumped around and if you didn't know the fairy tale story you were probably lost as to what was going on.  The only good acting I saw was the wicked Queen, she was really on the mark which is why I am giving it two stars, for the Queen. I have no words to describe the ending of the movie it was that bad.  So glad I viewed it beforehand, since I had thought about ordering it, which I didn't.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|The special effects were good. Charlese Theron was outstanding. Kristin not so much. They should have chosen someone else to play snow white.
B007FU1OH6|4.0|This was my first experience of Carlos Ruiz Zafon and I thoroughly enjoyed my time.<br />It took a little while to become accustomed to the writing style but then I was into and through the book in short order.<br />As proof positive of my experience I have already purchased other titles in this saga and am catching up.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Well worth the money.  I play seek and find games to relax and this one was really addictive. The storyline was interesting and graphics were great. Bring on game 2.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Decent movie, it was entertaining, which is the objective.....  i'd watch it again.  Plots was somewhat plausible, and there was a decent amount of action, and no blatantly horrible acting or writing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a fascinating read, I could not put it down.<br />I have an even greated respect for the people in uniform.<br />The author was a\\"rock star\\" but he also gave credit to those<br />who had supported this mission.<br />GOD BLESS our troops.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|This movie was pretty funny.  It had a lot of great comedy actors in it and there were several hilarious moments to be remembered.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|This is a fun, interesting game. No problems on fire - thanks for all the quick fixes Developer! Love it.<br />Keep up the creativity!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed the book \\"No Easy Day\\".<br />It is written in a staight forward manner with no fabulous verbage.  But I still enjoyed the narrative.<br />It seemed a factual account of the events leading up to the death of Osama Bin Laden.<br />I particular enjoyed the aspects related to the training and dedication of these heroes in carrying out their missions.<br />I certainly recommend the book!
B0085MNZ66|5.0|Works perfect as all aps do on EVO 4G, seems challenging played to level 11 before leaving the review. I don't understand why anyone would need instructions or a color wheel. you cross paths and you can see the color it will create not difficult even if some how you don't know your colors and how they mix. If you have simple problem solving capabilities, the game its very self explanatory. Clearly the game gets more difficult the further along you go. I think I am going to enjoy playing it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|After reading all three of the books, I can honestly say that I think this one was the best. Unlike in The Girl Who Played With Fire, the book had no trouble getting to the drama; from the first chapter to the.last, I stayed entertained.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This tape gives you a more personal view of our founding fathers (mainly John Adams but others as well)and what they went through to found this country.Every time you comlain about voting you should look at this DVD and see what others had to do to give you that privilege. Fantastic DVD.

B007THA4FI|1.0|The Kindle version of this book included 323 pages , the print copy contains 502 pages.  Comparing. page content shows that the Kindle version has fewer words per page.  Does this indicate two versions of this title?

1935251740|2.0|This book would more accurately be called \\"Egocentrism\\". Lanza takes more time explaining his qualifications and revisiting personal stories that brought him to his school of thought than he does explaining what his theory is. I bought this book because I have spent a lot of time thinking in this area and I was looking to find a refreshing outlook. Instead I was given poorly recycled explanations of quantum theory and special relativity followed by the claim that these were proof for his principles.<br /><br />This book sets out to explain consciousness and through it the reasoning for the universe, the two largest questions humanity has ever been put up against. And yet if this book was condensed to eliminate all autobiographical pages, it would consist of only 50 pages - if the bits of Einstein's postulations and various tests of quantum mechanics were taken out as well, you would find yourself without a book. Lanza states his \\"Principles of Biocentrism\\", but does not give them any detailed explanation, or why they are true - other than leading up to them with some experiment or analogy, often which don't logically lead into his stated principle.<br /><br />This is how the book is laid out: each chapter is on average 15 pages, the titles of which are inappropriately named, leaving you assuming they encompass a huge idea. Every other chapter is half a story about himself, and about a quarter of the chapters are entirely about himself. The chapters he attempts to justify \\"Biocentrism\\" typically end with: \\"to sum up\\" or \\"And so\\", this is this principle or that principle. Also scattered throughout the book are statements like \\"This is in accordance with Biocentrism\\" or \\"Not so, says Biocentrism\\". Again there are more words dedicated to whether or not something agrees with him and his theory than to what his theory actually is.<br /><br />If you want come to an end all \\"understanding of the true nature of the universe\\", read \\"The Beginning of Infinity\\" by David Deutsch. This man knows how to explain a way of thought in plain language using his own words and when appropriate supporting it with some test or theory of others, unlike Lanza, who hides behind his education and the respect that institutions give to him for his works in Biology.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought it was just me because of all the hoopla. I've been a bit out of it, living in Costa Rica. I came to the US and wanted to catch up on the happenings. I wasted my $9.99 on this book. It is immature, repetitious, beyond suspension of disbelief. The characters are annoying and unbelievable. I am one of those people who always finishes a book. I stopped half-way through this one. Don't waste your time or money.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|No superlative will be enough. The greatest soap opera in the history of the universe. And the acting! The scenery! The costumes! Mary's dresses, each more jaw-dropping than the next. Pure TV pleasure.

0525953728|5.0|Shame on the white house and the democratic platform for sending out such bad press and making this American hero sweat over this whole thing!!! The book didn't have any classified material in it at all. And I guess the white house actually helped to sell the book in the end, cause it gave it much press!! And shame on fellow seals for giving the guy a<br />hard time, cause i you read, you know there are PLENTY o other Navy Seals that have also written books, some with blessings from the President himself! (Marcus Latrel's book, Lonesome Survivor). Anyway, this book is awesome, and gives the reader a very good sense of what it's like to be a navy seal.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I'm sorry to say that this final book in the series was a huge let down!  Very drawn out and lack luster;-(
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Nothing can supplant a first-hand account.  An inside look at SEALS training in general added to the immediacy of the topic.  The attitudes and way of life of the SEALS themselves was also enlighteding.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|i got involved with the hereoin of this book and really was disappointed that it ended with not a continued book to follow her adventure.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|This novel did not make me laugh as much as I usually laugh while reading Kinsella's books (especially \\"I've Got Your Number\\"), but this was a fun and entertaining read. In this day so many authors are writing very serious books about our world that I do tend to read, but sometimes you need to take a break from the seriousness of our current situation and find something to make you laugh. Kinsella is an author that you can depend on for these kinds of lighthearted books. This is a book about a great aunt that dies at 105 years, but cannot move on to the other-world without finding her necklace that was stolen from her before her death. She appears to her niece as a ghost and the fun starts from there. The niece never really got to know her aunt, in fact the whole family just ignored her for many years while she was living in an elderly facility. Sadie (the great aunt) appears to her niece, Lara, at her funeral as a girl in her twenties and she and Lara go on from there trying to find the necklace. They have many fun adventures in this vein and Sadie has a lot of oldtime advice for Lara regarding love and life that qualified as a real hoot! Great beach book!
B008XG1X18|3.0|great app. so much better on a tablet than on a computer. i just wish it  would stop crashing every 5 minutes.
034580404X|5.0|This is the book of the year! A must read! Hopefully they make a movie... With the right characters for Christian & Anastasia!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Never have i read a book that i could not put down. Until this book.   I'm looking forward to the next two.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book and I must say it just made it that much better.<br />As an engineer I am fascinated by the skills of the master masons in building great cathedrals.<br />The book highlights how the systems of earls and lords and knights developed and is engrained in English law to this day.<br />Also the decimation of the great plague  or black death is covered well.<br />And finally the human side of the religious orders is highlighted in both the  the priory and the nunnery......as gossip has it neither the monks or nuns  escape the raw emotions or sexual tensions. Things haven't changed must.<br />A great read which grips the reader right through the book.<br />Rosco
B0085MNZ66|2.0|There are no instructions.  What I can understand is that I have to mix colors by dragging from one color and crossing the path of another color.  the first time you get to a level that requires it, you can drag the red across the yellow path to make orange, but dragging orange across yellow doesn't create red.  There doesn't appear to be a reason why it only works in one direction.
B00338QENI|4.0|Easy read. Well written. Touches on many different aspects of health care and how it has changed today by giving a personal look into a very significant person whose contribution seems to have gone unnoticed even still.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Purchased the blueray verson and was very pleased. There was some slow spots in the movie but over all am glad I own it and I do plan on watching it again. I have told my friends about the movie and I tell them its worth while. I purchased mine from Amazon and it cost less than Wal*Mart.
B004UID2LC|2.0|so i had this app for a while and it worked perfectly. i could download videos and watch/listen to them without wifi. but then one day it wouldnt let me download any more videos!!! i uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times but still wouldnt let me download videos!! please fix and i will rate higher!! anyone else having this problem!?

0393327345|4.0|Somewhere in a dark dank basement in your town; men are beating each other to a bloody pulp in order to prove that they are not their job title, bank account, SUV, or IPhone.<br />Before the movie would make it a cultural sensation, spawning several real life fight clubs worldwide, there was the book.  Author Chuck Palahniuk's first effort would turn out to be a knock-out punch.  He admits in the afterward that he was paid a mere $6,000.00 for the manuscript.  I hope he's getting paid hand over fist now.<br /><br />Like most people I didn't know there was a novel until after I had already seen the movie.  Fear not, you can still enjoy the book even if you saw the movie and know the twist.  The printed story has a different ending.<br /><br />So why is Fight Club so important?  Face it, we're set up from childhood by being told that we're special, we're important, we're number one, we can be anything we want to be, etc.  Eventually you realize that the contrary is actually true, we're all pretty insignificant.  If said realization doesn't drive you insane or into a deep depression; you accept it and go on to make the most of your mundane life.  America is such a commercial advertising driven, materialistic culture; always craving the latest gadget, luxury car, or designer clothing item.<br /><br />Tyler Durden understands that the things we own, own us.  He aggressively casts off the shackles of corporate, materialistic America and becomes free.  He recruits an army of disaffected men thru fight club to tear society down brick by brick so that we will all be truly equal.  He may be the most electrifying character in the last 25 years.<br /><br />I didn't see the movie until eight years after it was released.  Being a single thirty-something boy myself I immediately identified with it.  It spoke to me like no other work ever had before.  I was struggling to keep my home and put food in my belly performing a job I despised, because I was told that's what you're supposed to do.  I often thought about liquidating my few assets, abandoning my home and liberating myself from the whole scene.  In the end, my possessions ultimately won.  Their hold on me is too great.  I simply can't give up all the things I worked so hard for and nullify my life.  It's still fun to entertain the thought though.<br /><br />If you want to find out where it all began, pick up a copy of the novel.d to do.

B007R41E8O|3.0|A fun and fast game, but it kept freezing up then kicking me back to the start menu.  Looking forward to the conclusion.
0441013074|4.0|The story was a little slow to get started, but was a real page turner in the last half. Reynolds managed to meld hard sf, space opera, time travel, political intrigue, romance, mystery, and hard-nosed detective into a single great story. Good stuff!

B000FA5STS|4.0|As with all Baldacci books I enjoyed the suspense with the story. He keeps you hypothesise with its final ending thus preventing you from putting the book down.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is quite a departure from the author's previous books, of course, and is sure to irritate and anger some of her fans, but it should find its own audience quickly. The characters in this novel have nasty little secrets and the death which opens the story serves to reveal their many flaws. All of this makes Rowling appear more cynical and less humorous than in the Harry Potter series, and the book did start to feel very dreary about one third through. But I soldiered on, confident that the feeling of being in the hands of an excellent storyteller I had enjoyed during the opening pages would pay off. And it did. The resolution, while tragic, was satisfying and the changes that characters exhibited were believable and touching. I think her characters rang true and even though their lives were rather sordid, I didn't feel that the book itself was. It made for an engrossing, thought-provoking read. I would recommend it, but read the synopsis and don't expect anything magical other than Rowling's deft ability to expose a character's innermost secrets with precision and wit.<br /><br />From the book:<br />Even as they discussed what they had been forced to witness, each trying to drive out vague feelings of fright and shock, feathery little ripples of excitement had tickled Miles' insides at the thought of delivering the news to his father. He had intended to wait until seven, but fear that somebody else might beat him to it had propelled him to the telephone early.
B00992CF6W|3.0|First off, you can't actually craft your own recipies. If someone had put that in their review, I would have NEVER paid the $6.99 for this version. It's ok if you're happy just building because they do provide you with some decent blocks but don't buy if you're a die hard minecraft fan. Untill they update or add more features, you're better off getting block story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found the book No Easy day to be interesting, informative, and even inspiring.  I was especially impressed with the modesty of the author and his matter of fact presentation of the facts about the operation that killed osama Bin Laden.<br /><br /> I spent 4 years in the marine Corps back in the 60's and even served a tour in Viet Nam.  While I wasn't a grunt and involved in any long stretches in enemy territory like many of my comrades, my experience there left me with some insight about how Marines and even special forces troops handle their jobs.  They just have to do what they have to do and I think this book allows anyone a realistic insight into how our well trained troops handle facing the danger and even terror they confront.<br /><br />The wider scope of the book allows the reader to gain some further insight into how our intelligence community gathers data and information that aids our military people when they have to go on a mission.  There are litteraly thousands of those missions that we will never even hear about, but in this one mission - the mission to actually kill Bin laden - the reader is given a view by those who were actually there and shown what thourough training can produce.<br /><br />To me the killing of Bin Laden is the final chapter in the 9/11 story - justice was done for all the innocent victims nd their families.<br /><br />Dan Van Bibber
B0072OFM28|4.0|It seems like lots of folks were let down by changes in the cast, this really wasn't the case for me.  I'm still captivated by the Spartacus series and all its gory glory.  I watched the entire second season in one day, as I just couldn't stop watching.  Lots of twists and turns, and outrageous action.  All in all, this season picks up nicely where the other left off.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|I find this product description to be misleading.  There is nothing to indicate that the digital download is SD.  When a movie is purchased as a set that includes two HD versions (including 3D), and specifically advertises a digital download as a 4th disc in a 4 disc set, it reasonable to assume that the digital download is HD, unless stated otherwise.  Yet when I entered the code through iTunes (one of 2 given options, the other being Windows Media Player), I received the SD version, whether or not I downloaded directly to my iPad or though iTunes.  The HD version is available for purchase through iTunes.<br /><br />The movie is great, but I was stuck watching it in SD in a hotel, so this product is not.  If I had known the digital copy was SD, I would have just bought the HD digital version through Amazon or iTunes, not the set, as my personal preference is digital.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I noticed that a lot of people really didn't like this movie.  I'm not sure why.  It seems it may have been billed as something other than what it was, which is a film about hope and survival.  As for me, I loved this film and think that the performances were outstanding, as was the story, and the telling of parallel packs.  There are a lot of subtle things taking place in this film, which makes it worth more than one viewing.  Well done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find this app very thorough and use it all the time.  I use it almost every day and I'm still discovering new features.
B004V9MU86|5.0|This book is not to be missed. Beautifully written, it's both amusing and profound and tugs at the heart strings without being sloppy or insincere. It seems a bit confusing to start with, but stick with it and it becomes clear. I found myself reading more and more quickly to see what happens and absolutely cried my eyes out at the end of the book. In reviews, I have read that I'm not the only one!!! My whole family has read this book and we've all enjoyed it. Don't hesitate to buy it.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|In typical SEAL style, Owens does not pull any punches in telling the story of those courageous individuals, who gathered the intel, planned, prepared, and executed \\"Operation Geronimo\\". \\"No Easy Day\\", is a compelling and inspiring book about the sacrifices and selfless courage of the men and women who have, and continue, to make this country the greatest in the history of the world. Owens reward for telling us the truth, the BOHICA. This is how we treat our heroes?<br /><br />\\"No Easy Day\\" is a must read for those who are interested in contrasting the truth, of a truly historic event, with how our politician's lie in self-promoting schemes to further their political ambitions, and how they invoke plausible deniability to distance themselves from un-sanitized covert events. For politicos, public perception is reality, so, how dare Owens call the Washington insider's to task for leaking and profiting from highly sensitive top secret details of the UBL mission, and for distorting the facts of this historic event toward their own self-serving ends. Mark did not let the Pentagon, REMF's, intimidate him for going public, and setting the record straight. However, in the process, as they have with others who refused to kowtow, put this SEAL, his mate's, and their family's lives in imminent danger.<br /><br />As a SEAL team leader and operator, his indefatigable determination allowed him to improvise, adapt, and overcome all mental and physical challenges, and he not only prevails, but thrives in an overwhelmingly hostile environment. It is a story that needed to be told, and Dutton/Penguin Publishing, U.S.A. and Mark Owens did an outstanding job bringing this story to the public.
B0033780Y0|1.0|I have read probably half of this book, and I'm having a hard time getting through it. It's very poorly written and even boring in parts.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A Game of Thrones is a fantastic read.  With the chapters each being of a different characters perception of events going on and moving the story along through there tale makes these books a unique, complicated and with an incredible amount of depth.  If you have the time I would highly suggest this read.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I read the other reviews and have to Disagree. I have a Kindle Fire and it works fine on mine. There are times its slow or I have to close then open again but 95% of the time it's good.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Interesting story but way too dark and the S&M stuff is a little too much.  I did go on to read the other two books and it does get better and ends pretty well but this first book is over the top with elicit sex scenes and fantasizes being abused and dominated by a mentally ill man.  Not good for younger readers for sure.
0525953728|5.0|Book arrived in excellent condition and arrived as promised. The book was an easy read and there were enough interesting tidbits about life as a SEAL to keep my interest peaked. It successfully brought a human element to the work that most casual citizens would have trouble relating to. No big intelligence leaks here, just an entertaining bio.
B005PK553C|5.0|Best Series Ever! :) Couldn't stop watching it, very unique and exciting shows! keeps you wondering the whole time.. Must watch!
B009CYCF5I|5.0|P!nk is back with another amazing album, just love every song...  And this limited edition is better than I specter. So far, this is my favorite P!nk's album!!!!  Don't know why, but, it remind me of the Missundeaztood days when every song have a life of it's own.<br /><br />AMAZING!!!
0441013597|5.0|This novel is not just a true masterpiece of Science Fiction but also of literature!!  This book is packed with so many amazing ideas without distracting from the powerful story.<br /><br /> No other book, other than Lord of the Rings, compares to its craftsmanship.<br /><br />Both books deal with the Theme of \\"POWER\\".  LOTR with the quest of giving up power and DUNE with the consequences of pursuing and wielding power.<br /><br />Both are Must reads before you die!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|What an amazing read!  Totally lost track of time while reading this story.  Characters were really well developed and the story itself was unique and original.  This is  a rare feat in today's world of copycat writing.  I have never been disappointed with a Mitch  Albom authored story.  Even my husband, who isn't much on reading, enjoyed it!

0316228532|5.0|I'm surprised the reaction to Rowling's first adult novel has been so tepid.  Yes, the book is nothing like \\"Harry Potter\\", but it is so impressive in its own right.  I'm actually a huge \\"Harry Potter\\" fan, but those were young adult books, and while they displayed JK Rowling's humor, memorable characters, excellent plotting, and fabulous imagination, they didn't give as much scope to her talent as a realist, satirist, and acute observer of human nature.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" fully proves that Rowling is a serious writer, able to lay bare the foibles of human behavior in a scathing and often hilarious manner, something of a modern Jane Austen in that regard.  Meanwhile, other scenes in the novel are quite emotionally powerful and touching.  Rowling builds a stable of complex, interconnected characters who are fascinating in their machinations, and she is surprisingly adept at examining complex social issues like welfare, drug addiction, cycles of abuse, and the burden/responsibility of the disadvantaged and indigent.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe the plot of \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" because the squabbling of small-town individuals over a local government seat sounds tedious in the utmost, but believe me when I say the book is anything but boring.  The characters are vivid and fascinating, and their town and politics are a microcosm for society and government as a whole.<br /><br />I actually listened to this book on audio, narrated by Tom Hollander, and I would absolutely recommend that medium.  Hollander does the accents and voices so well, and gives such an intense sense of humor and drama to the proceedings, it was like watching a play.  I was so absorbed that I sat down and listened to the book while doing absolutely nothing else, while usually I would be running or sewing or driving or cooking at the same time.  I knew I recognized Hollander's voice, so I checked him in IMDB and realized he is the same actor who gave such a creepy, villainous performance in \\"Hanna\\" and was so funny in so many comedies I've seen, so it's no surprise he is so highly skilled vocally.  He provided the perfect mood and tone for the book.<br /><br />I should mention, if you get an audible.com membership you can basically get the audiobook for about $7.50, which is actually cheaper than the Kindle or hardcover version.  That's why I did it initially, and then I ended up enjoying it immensely.

B0033807C2|5.0|This is one of my absolute faviorite Percy Jackson books in the series. Its a toss up between this and The Lightning Theif. Partly because this one has epic amounts of fight senes, and all the loose ends get tied up from this series, but it leaves possibilities of another series SPOILER &#34;&#34; which it does &#34;&#34;END ( and it is called heroes of olympus, and mark of athena is out TOMORROW !thank you! ) I was delighted with this book and you get to kunw who the dreaded Spy for Kronos is. I garrentee you will not know who it is. I also love how Nico has a main part in the story , and the chapter titles n the whole seres is very funny. example &#34;I become the supreme lord of the bath room&#34; or &#34; I take the worst bath ever&#34;

0452295548|5.0|This book came to my home quickly. I read it before but shared the book with a friend, so I decided to order another one.  So..this is my second time reading this book, and I realized I missed so much information on the first read. It has opened my eyes and my right hemisphere...Thank you
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Mommy porn! One of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put them down. I finished all three books in 10 days!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|The title says it all, but I'll go into detail for any prospective buyers, after growing out of my taste for audio polluted with bass (XB700 was my most recent set of cans), I decided to go with a pair of reference headphones. After much researching and reading reviews on Sennheiser, Grados, AKG, etc, I decided on the AKG K702s for two reasons, spacious pads, and comfort for my huge head (64cm, size 8 fitted), all the Sennheisers I could get my hands on squeezed my head.<br /><br />Then my friend Zach let me try his K701s on and that sealed the deal, they fit perfectly, off to Amazon and the K702 were cheaper than the K701 at the time, so why not? Being Friday, and me being impatient I ordered Saturday delivery and got them the next day. I haven't tried watching movies with them, but I'm sure that'll be amazing, too; music on the other hand, is an entirely new experience with them versus headphones and audio equipment I've used in the past.<br /><br />I hear things in songs that I've never heard before, I don't know how I've been living with my past audio gear, I'm obviously still leaving them on to break them in when not in use, but listening to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here in FLAC format (I still can't tell a major difference between MP3 and FLAC before flames start), I just wanted the highest possible quality source, and it's just a transcendent experience to listen to.<br /><br />Currently powering them with a FiiO E17 I already had, but I intend on upgrading to a desktop amp, in case you were wondering the E17 is plenty to drive these cans to levels beyond the volumes I can tolerate. The bass is unlike anything I've ever heard before, it's clean, controlled, crisp, I'm used to my old headphones where the bass would swamp the track, with the K702s, there's not as much bass, but when there is bass, there is BASS. It has all the bass I could possibly want, cleanly, clearly, without interfering or overpowering any of the track. Everything about these headphonesis perfect in my opinion, and I don't know how I would go back to listening any other way.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Worked amazingly until it didn't. It says searching and won't dpwnload anything. I mean, it's been 6 months since I got it, and it's worked fine. So yeah, just that little thing.
B007CKNX28|5.0|This album is not an obvious rock and roll record. This album, after 3 listenings will explode your senses and remind you how good a rock and roll album can be.
030758836X|5.0|Great. Book and concept.  I was a bit disappointed by the end...too tidy and not sufficiently punitive. But, the twist of events and over all style were great.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it really has no point but it is kinda fun so that is why I said it was ok and not the best game ever
B007T99ENE|3.0|It comes as no surprise that this is a beautifully written novel, having been written by Ian McEwan. The setting is very interesting, involving a young female recruit to M15 in the early 1970s, at which time Britain was struggling to combat IRA terrorism and the dying stages of the Cold War, as well as dealing with domestic political issues. Characters, even minor ones, are beautifully drawn. I had a slight issue with the conclusion of the novel, which I found a little contrived and unconvincing, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.
0375842209|5.0|One of my favorite book. It brings back many sad memories, living in Europe those years as a child. Thanks
B008I3R2VG|5.0|I have always loved the Killers and this album didn't disappoint. Dont be put off by any of the negative reviews, I have a feeling the majority of the people think its so-so listened to the album once or twice. Battleborn has a bit of a different sound to it and is a good edition to their collective work. I cant wait to see them live mixing these new songs with the old. Trust me you will fall in love with Battleborn.
B00931JMRE|5.0|Another classic from one of Texas' best little ol' bands. Truly an amazing album, these guys just keep getting better with age.
0552998931|4.0|This book has been on my reading list for some time and I read it with a pleasure that matched my anticipation.  Beautiful Vivianne Rocher opens a chocolate shop in the small French town of Lansquenet.  The people of this isolated little village view her and her daughter with suspicion, especially when she serves her decadent delicacies on Sundays!  Located across from the church, she can see the local priest always watching.  She thinks of him as the man in black who has haunted her dreams her since childhood.<br /><br />Vivianne wears bright colors and identifies closely with anyone who comes into her shop, even the \\"river people\\" when they park their houseboats on the banks of the local river.  Vivianne is carefree, happy and giving to all she meets.  Is she a witch as the priest believes or just a sensitive person who strives to help others?  The magic of this delightful read may remain your heart for some time.  I really liked Chocolat.
B0095R64AO|2.0|This had very few funny moments. It was also too long.<br /><br />Would not recommend if you are looking for a good laugh.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app makes Spider fun. Spider is a game that requires more thought and patience than Solitaire, but the enjoyment of winning the occasional game is well worth the effort required.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love  book book one and two and definitely looking forward to book three  I definitely recommend this    <br />book to my friends
B0098VXE50|2.0|I had high hopes for the movie.  However, it was just so-so. Kristen Stewart was very good.  Though not her fault, it seemed that Charlize Theron was not well-cast for the role.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|This is one of my all - time favorite SiFi movies. Great for any \\"Action Movie collection\\".<br />I have always wanted this Movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A look inside the men's life which keep this country safe and strong. Thank you to all our armed forces
B007THA4FI|4.0|I will keep this short. I think Miss Rowling has done an excelent job with this book. The characters are down to earth as well as cleverly interlinked with each other. I am not even half way through but I am looking forward to finishing the book. The only reason why I haven't finished it is because I am studying a degree along side it.<br />I look forward to finishing work on the night and sitting down and having a good read of this book.<br /><br />TO THOSE WHO ARE COMPARING THIS TO HARRY POTTER- DONT. Harry Potter is the best thing to ever happen to English fiction, but it should not be compared. This is a book for adults and the two should not be linked.<br /><br />JK Rowling is an excelent author and I would recomend this book to anyone with a passion for reading.<br /><br />This book is for the Harry Potter fans who have grown up as well as anyone else. Im 18 now, but il always still read Harry Potter. I haven't grown up just yet and I don't think I ever will.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It is gripping a read but It felt medival in some ways though time depicted is in future. Also 3rd part felt a drag and was unnecessary gore
B0094KF4WG|4.0|A risky venture on the part of the writer given that his true identity has been exposed.The mission,although well planned etc in the end was ad hoc.It reminds me of the Bay of Pigs fiasco 4 JFK.No wonder Obama was looking worried.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|interesting plot and nice combination of logic and hidden. object tasks. but navigation back and forth through completed areas plus no zoom on hidden objects can lead to some hair pulling moments
B005HJU7HA|5.0|These stories are classic. It is so nice to have them on my Kindle. They are so much fun to read, and I am really enjoying them. Thank you to whoever made these available for the Kindle. They're great!
B008ER9QKG|4.0|This new Ring Cycle at the MET is a very good production. The stage set is made for the 21st century - great job! Maestro Luisi conducted very well. Unfortunately, Maestro Levine, due to his illness, couldn't continue. Best wishes for his recovery. The orchestra as good as all the time. Consider on what short notice Jay Hunter Morris had to jump in to play the main character role as Siegfried, he did an excellent job! He is not a Siegfried Jerusalem, who was brilliant in the Ring Cycle of the 90s directed by Otto Schenck, but such a brilliant voice is very rare and Mr. Morris did his job very well and he will grow into this part. Deborah Voigt in her debut as Bruennhilde sang very good, but one would wish a better acting performance on stage. The highlight of this cycle is definitely Bryn Terfel as Wotan/Wanderer and Jonas Kaufmann as Siegmund. Bryn Terfel probably close to the best performance I have heard someone sang this role. Only John Tomlinson was slightly better, but Mr. Terfel is great on stage and brilliant in his voice. Bravo Jonas Kaufmann, what a great performance as Siegmund. His voice is a God-given gift. Wonderful! Other very goog singers were Hans-Peter Koenig as Fafner/Hunding/Hagen. The best Hagen I have ever heard! Also, Eric Owens was a brilliant Alberich. Superb! This is a worthy production for the 21st century. The additional DVD on the development and production of the Ring is a great inside view on how this production developed and the problems that happened along the way. Bravo MET! This Ring Cycle is a success!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Fans of Lee Child and Jack Reacher will enjoy this book.  As expected, the book is well written and well paced.  On the down side, the book seems a little formulaic, and not particularly inspired.  Still, the book is a good read, and I am glad that I did so
B009IJJ712|4.0|Sherlock Holmes rises again, this time in the persona of Jonny Lee Miller, a self-centered, living off his father's trust fund morphine addict released/escaped from rehab and in the care of Ex-surgeon turned sour on a lost patient Dr Joan Watson (Lucy Liu).  Though it is difficult to evaluate where this takeoff is going, at the present episode we do get to appreciate the much-tattooed Miller and the always beautiful Liu banter back and forth, with Holmes performing his rather mind-boggling ability to read clues and people and Watson as his `guardian'.  The show has possibilities though it is difficult to reconfigure the droll, elegant original Holmes in the form of this always-on-the-verge-of-withdrawal fast-talking new image. One of the finer moments of the new episode, almost ruined by Holmes misbehavior, is a moment at the opera where opera singers Randal Turner and Melissa Zapin are performing Wagner's `Tristan und Isolde'.  Maybe there is hope that the series will progress down those lines of enlightenment. Grady Harp, September 12
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Its the kind of book you don't want to put down.  I was pacing myself because I wanted to savor the story. Blake's stories have a tendency to do that to you. Yes I could feel some of the similarities or should I say the feeling that Twin Peaks made me feel all those years ago.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|Has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment? Judging by the enormous popularity of everything cinematic based on superheroes and sci-fi extravaganzas I suppose the answer is `Yes!'  To sit in one place for an excess of 2 ½ hours and witness the destruction derby that is the apocalyptic bad guys (in the form of a light spear carrying Loki (Tom Hiddleston) against Samuel L. Jackson's SHIELD cast of make-believe folks - Robert Downey, Jr in armor, Chris Evans in his Captain America Halloween costume, Mark Ruffalo unconvincingly transforming into the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as hammer wielding Thor, Scarlett Johansson as a pretty Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye all out to make life sustainable for the leasers like Stellan Skarsgård, Clark Gregg, and Colbie Smulders - is a feat in itself.<br /><br />For movies of this type this one has more color and imaginative loco devices that most and therefore I suppose it remains at the top of the heap.  When will these characters run out of tales?  The answer likely is `When the movie public stops ling up for these epics.' Grady Harp, September 12
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I did not think a lack of instructions made this that difficult. I got through the first 10 puzzles before writing this and they took me fewer than 10 minutes to do all ten.<br /><br />It IS a fun little challenge to figure out how to get the lines to cross correctly to create the right colours.  I like it.
B008602KQI|4.0|I am not much of a reviewer. I can only say I enjoyed this movie. It exceeded my expectations. Quite a bit of drama and violence for a 'teen' movie but the novel is about a very dark subject. There is also some interesting political intrigue. This is the first of 3 parts. I am reading the novels. It's worth your time
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|its awesome it works for me a lot and I love so so so much it helps for math and work problems
B004TSXUWY|3.0|A little slow...takes time to pick up but ends up in a nice/ well built thriller. Perfect to read before going to sleep :-)
B0085MNZ66|1.0|too hard I cant play it and I am smart too I am a straight F student and I am 18 years old in7th grade. you should make it like a game with colors and stuff also u smell like a giraffe :-)
B008Q1T1IW|5.0|Intouchables is a warm funny, very French (in the best sense) movie. All of the main characters are first rate. You'll laugh, and perhaps tear-up here and there, but you will enjoy the film from beginning to end.
0385344333|4.0|I'm a big fan of Jack Reacher.<br /><br />I noticed there were a lot of negative reviews.<br />I don't get that.<br /><br />This was a typical Jack Reacher Adventure.<br />He got right smack dab into the middle of trouble...typical.<br /><br />It moved a long at a good pace, I wanted to know what was going to happen next.<br />It wasn't too wordy.<br />There was action!  As always.<br /><br />I just hope his next ride gets him to Virginia already...<br /><br />The narrator is Dick Hill and he does an excellent job.<br /><br />Just so you can know from comparison...<br />The only Jack Reacher book I did not like was Running Blind - I just thought that was predictable and silly.<br /><br />I recommend A Wanted Man by Lee Child for all Reacher fans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'd feel like a loser for &quot;rating&quot; the Bible as anything less than five stars, but this app deserves five stars. Six, even. It's that good. The part where you can have the guy read passages aloud is phenomenal. I didn't know about that feature when I downloaded this, but it's extraordinarily convenient. Also, the index is great.<br />The only downside about it on my Kindle Fire is... nope, can't think of any. :)
B008KOMMTA|5.0|Please note:although this title has been released world wide simultaneously it is indeed REGION A LOCKED!!!!WILL NOT PLAY on a variety of bluray players.I did'nt think that this was the purpose of region coding of titles.What an annoying problem.Anthony B.(aussie land)

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this movie. The action scenes are fantastic and the characters are great.... The Hulk is played particularly well. I watched the blu ray with my family when it was released and I didn't notice any problems with the sound.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I read this on a whim and enjoyed the heck out of it. I love Kings extraterrestrial stories, they are always a hoot.
B003C34CZG|5.0|I'll be completely honest, it wasn't too long ago when I hated My Chemical Romance. I thought they were boring, overdramatic, too emo, and senseless. People used to ask me if I liked their music and I'd flat out say,\\"no.\\" Then one day I was listening to music with my friend and she had \\"Teenagers\\" playing on her IPod. I told her to change it and the song ended following \\"Drowning Lessons\\" If it wasn't for that song I would have never even thought twice about My Chemical Romance. I fell inlove with \\"Drowning Lessons\\" and I ended up falling inlove with \\"Demolition Lovers\\". My love started small, loving song by song when eventually I decided to discover the whole album. A great discover since I love enjoy every single song in this album it's own way. Now, I love basically every song from My Chemical Romance. Kind of funny huh? Started with \\"Drowning Lessons\\" now it's every song. So here's my review and comments on this album's songs:<br />1) Romance- just something to kind of start the album. I thought it was pretty chill I have really no real opinion on it but I feel the album would be incomplete without it. NR.<br />2)Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough For the Two of Us-  ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS FROM MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE. Probably because I can relate to it or who knows? I love everything about the song. The music, the lyrics, the screaming, the meaning, everything. Strongly reccomended to be listened to. 1000000000/10<br />3)Vampires Will Never Hurt You- This song is great but I don't start to get addicted to it and singing my heart out with it until it reaches the end. 9.5/10<br />4)Drowning Lessons- I LOVE THIS SONG. this song is the first song I liked from MCR. It's amazing. I love the guitar in this song and I can strongly relate to the lyrics! Please do listen to this song. 20/10<br />5)Our Lady Of Sorrows- I love this song, but I wouldn't call it my favorite. Sometimes I listen to it if the mood asks for it and I enjoy how much he cusses in this song. 10/10<br />6)Headfirst for Halos- ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS. I listen to this song when I'm depressed or delusional. It's amazing and I feel like the lyrics somehow reach out to me and I love the music in this song! 90000/10<br />7)Skylines and Turnstiles- A GREAT SONG. Not my favorite but I like the lyrics and I love the guitar in the end. 9.5/10<br />8)Early Sunsets Over Monroeville- This song always gets my emotional and I sometimes feel like it was written for me. I can relate to this song so well and I love how the music gets a bit harder around the beginning of the end of the song. Reccomended. 10/10<br />9)This Is The Best Day Ever- I usually listen to this song when I have a great day. It's a great song but you're only probably gonna be in the mood for it if you're happy! 300/10<br />10)Cubicles- ONE OF MY FAVORITES. Actually I could say it's my favorite. The song is so amazing it gets better the farther the song goes on and I think one of the greatest lines ever said in a MCR song is from this song,\\"I think I'd love to die alone\\" You won't regret listening to this song!!! 1 billion/10<br />11)Demolition Lovers- this song is most likely MCR's most original song they've ever made. The guitar in this song is unforgettable and the lyrics are a true 10/10. The song is very long but you won't want to stop listening to it. 394839585035083/10
B000OVLINI|5.0|It's the first book I read by Zafon. His book is riveting, spell-binding and addictive.His use of words portrayed such vividness and clarity.The book held my interest to the very end . I just could not wait to read his other book. This is a definite read for any language or literary enthusiast. What Zafon does is use words so efficiently that the images become real immediately leaving you spellbound by both the imagination as well as his expertise as a modern writer. To miss reading Zafon is to miss the cherry on top of the whipped cream. Worth every word. Highly recommended.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I installed this game on the kindle fire and when I opened it, it wouldn't work. I couldn't even try it, so I hate it. It might happen to others, but don't waste your time.
B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|*UPDATED 10/17/12* Price dropped to $40 so added 1 star.<br /><br />Our family had the Lego Star Wars 2011 calendar last year and the kids loved it! It's still available for about $35, which is what this set should cost max in my opinion.  $50 is a huge increase from last year and, Star Wars or not, is most definitely too high a price for the miniature ships to be built from it.  Darth Maul Santa is, admittedly, pretty cool...but not that cool.  5 stars for the product, minus 3 for the exaggerated price.
0553381695|5.0|Received what expected, A couple of pages at the end of the book are an ad for the TV series (same for the cover), which I find a little cheap, but I knew what I would get when I ordered. The book make was good quality. The book is still in good shape and did not get destroyed after a summer or reading on the beach, as some paperbacks would do.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|As much as I liked the Dark Knight Returns comic book, I didnt LOVE it as much as other people. I personally felt that there were plenty of other great Batman adaptations. I also had slightly lower expectations for the film since I felt that many of the more recent DC offerings were slightly rushed or disappointing. After watching the film though I have to say that I was pretty blown away. I think the movie is better than the comic book. The film is simply outstanding. The voice acting was great and the music was some of the coolest music that I have ever heard in an animated film. It really sets the mood perfectly. Some people have complained that the film removed some of Batman's inner dialogue and that the story was padded to divide it up into two films. I couldnt disagree more. The story is paced perfectly and it would have been impossible to fit both parts into one movie.  Also, having the inner dialogue wouldnt have worked as well in a film version. It works better for a comic book.  What makes this a better adaptation than the comic book is the hard hitting action and violence. Its hard to feel the impact of the fight scenes in the comic book but in the movie its brutal and fun to watch. This movie has got it all: great voice acting, great story, brutal action, a very dark Batman which we all love, and some fantastic music that really takes it to another level.<br /><br /> Bottom line: If you are slightly interested in the movie but have been disappointed by some of the recent DC animated movies I strongly recommend that you pick this up or at least rent it. (Come on! If you are not going to buy it you at least have to rent it!!)<br /><br />This is definitely one of DC's best. Right up there with Under the Red Hood and Mask of the Phantasm.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The book makes you realize how far in quality of life we have come in 100 years.  Helps recognize why the middle class is so important. The struggles of the workers and the first world war are covered well and In story that keeps you reading
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great information about the incorrect concept of low fat diets.  I've been hypoglycemic since the 70's and when I saw the food pyramid change, what 30 years or so ago.....I knew a whole bunch of people will begin putting on weight.  I am basically allergic to carbs.  My insulin system goes into overdrive and sends a flood of insulin which takes my blood sugar which has been raised by eating carbs, and takes too much of it away for storage.  I don't need more storage!  But it also leaves me with low blood sugar manifested as stupid and cranky.  Maybe with Taubes help, we can get back to some sensible food guidelines.  Not everyone can eat the amount of carbs recommended by the Food Pyramid!  Great book.....thanks.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like it a lot. it lets me know what my battery is on even when my phone doesn't sometimes. and the sync is very effective. Gracias.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg  this the best book ever i can't believe its this good. It was actually an action, adventure, and a romantic movie all in one. I don't even have enough room to describe it. There aren't even enough pieces of paper for me to write to u about.
B007Z9QWVK|4.0|If you throw out the modern storyline, very heavy handed drama with Madonna's fingerprints all over it, and just enjoy the flashback scenes of the love affair of Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII it is so worth viewing. The fashion, the actress who plays Wallis are both perfection...Jill

B000FA5SMK|5.0|Excellent book, very fast paced. Reads like a roller coaster with lots of ups and downs and turns and twists. Highly recommended.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I enjoyed both the earlier film, The Omega Man, as well as the second attempt, I am Legend.  In the book we get a better feel for Neville and his personal vampire/zombie apocalypse as well as his aching loneliness at first.  I wish the developing society of live-vampires had been explored in a little more detail, but it must be kept more unknown to allow the development of the Legend.  Looking at the cover all in red and black I'm glad I have it as an e-book, they really need to reconsider the cover imho.  (I know, bad review, but I'll get better as I go).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is really an amazing thing.  I installed Swiftkey a few weeks ago, and it actually has learned my most common words and phrases.  Typing is so much faster now.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|While most of the reviews I have seen so far regarding the release of Prometheus on Blu-ray have done a fine job at criticizing much of the movie and director for some reason, I would just like to review the features list for this release in particular.  According to recently released specs, the 3D 4 disc set is the one to go for.  On Amazon.com there is no indication of the special features list for either the 2 or 4 disc versions, but evidently this release, the 3D version, is the one that will have an extra special features disc and is actually referenced as the \\"Collector's Edition\\" release.  The additional features available on both the 2 and 4 disc sets are as follows:<br />Disc 1<br />*Theatrical Cut<br />*Commentary by Director/Producer Ridley Scott<br />*Commentary by Writer Jon Spaihts and Writer/Executive Producer Damon Lindelof<br />*\\"The Peter Weyland Files\\"<br />*Deleted and Alternate Scenes that include an Alternate Opening / Ending<br />*Prometheus - Weyland Corp Archive Second Screen App<br /><br />Disc 2<br />*DVD / Digital Copy<br /><br />The four disc has these additional extras:<br /><br />Disc 3<br />*3D Theatrical Cut of Movie<br /><br />Disc 4<br />*\\"The Furious Gods: Making Prometheus\\"<br />*Enhancement Pods<br />*Weyland Corp Archive<br />*Pre-Vis<br />*Screen Tests<br /><br />So for those of you, like me, that really enjoy the extras (and by the way the trailer video for the 4 disc set leads with the words \\"questions will be answered\\" and references Planet LV-426 and the Alien tie-in questions that other reviewers mention as faults with the movie), this is the one to go for.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|After all of the press regarding this book, I was a little hesitate about reading it.  However, I was pleasantly surprised of the content of this book.  It not only discussed the Bin Laden mission in detail, it also gave you a great insight on the life of a Navy SEAL on a regular basis as well.<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK...the author who does use an alias for this book, writes a gripping, hard to put down book that will share some light on how difficult these warriors lives are.  As a USMC Veteran and currently a Army SGT, I give you all of the praise in the world.  A job well done!

0199561915|5.0|PERSPECTIVES ON HOMICIDE LAW REFORM FROM A FORMER LAW COMMISSIONER<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Controversies surrounding homicide law continue to abound in the arena of public debate over such matters as mercy killing and for another example: the rights or lack of them of a householder who unintentionally kills to protect their family and property.<br /><br />The lawyer, academic, or policy maker involved in such issues, will find much useful commentary in this book recently published by the Oxford University Press as part of the OUP's Oxford Monographs on Criminal Law and Justice series under the editorship of Professor Andrew Ashworth.  As the author, Professor Horder was formerly a Law Commissioner Ashworth's introduction to the book commends it as a unique insider's view of the ways and means by which law reform in the context of homicide can be accomplished.<br /><br />Those who seek the reform of homicide law will be interested in Horder's view that a degree of deference to public opinion on this issue (as opposed to elite or expert opinion) is essential for conferring true legitimacy on homicide law reform in a democracy. He expresses dismay early on in the book that, in his words, public opinion - properly and professionally researched - on homicide law reform remains regarded as largely irrelevant to the legislative process. `Citizens of the state,' he says `are onlookers in the process.'<br /><br />Horder elaborates quite logically and sometimes controversially on this state of affairs and goes on to suggest that `the merits of morally controversial legal reforms should be made automatically subject to review (roughly) every fifteen to twenty years.'  This sounds reasonable, although many lawyers would cite the dangers of public opinion emerging as the sole arbiter of changes in the law.  One wonders if, for example, the majority of public opinion in the UK has ever supported the abolition of the death penalty.

0525953728|5.0|This is a first-hand account of the bin Laden mission. Most readers will recognize that, in spite of what the government is saying, no military secrets were revealed. Rather, DoD is suing the author because this account differs from the \\"official\\" story. Also, there was the slightest suggestion that the mission might have been authorized for political purposes. The author also shows that in spite of his sanctioning of numerous suicide missions, in the end bin Laden was nothing more than a coward, as are all terrorists.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone who has been yearning for justice since 9/11.
1405770317|5.0|NOW AVAILABLE:  THE ANNUAL ANNOTATED COPY OF THE FINANCE ACT FROM TOLLEY'S<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Published annually, this Handbook on the Finance Act has become indispensable for practitioners having to cope with the fact that this year's Finance Act -- given Royal Assent on 17 July 2012 -- `is most probably the longest ever'.<br /><br />Referring to the ever increasing length of the legislation, one of the distinguished contributors writing in the Introduction to the Handbook declares that `the advocates of legislation that is simpler and shorter (though the one does not necessarily imply the other) do seem to have lost the battle if not the war'. A sign of the times unfortunately with a mounting tide of new and detailed legislation every year!<br /><br />But lengthy or not, this is the United Kingdom's tax legislation just as it is, which makes this Tolley Handbook an indispensable source of information and guidance for the busy practitioner charged with providing accurate, reliable advice to his or her clients.<br /><br />Speaking of the contributors, all forty or so of them (if we have counted correctly) are acknowledged experts in tax-related fields, spanning law and accountancy and together  constitute a formidable reservoir of expertise and research.<br /><br />Following careful study and analysis, each specialist has prepared carefully judged annotations explaining each provision, with the aim of helping practitioners find immediate answers to all but the most obscure queries on the Act.  As there is no table of contents as such, the Introduction does the job for us by summarizing the contents of the Handbook and there is a fairly detailed index at the back to facilitate looking things up quickly.<br /><br />Linking the legislation and commentary together in a convenient paperback format of 700 or so pages, this, then, is the definitive Handbook on the Finance Act aimed at providing expert advice for expert advisors.  If you are just such an advisor, this compact and reliable volume from Tolley's belongs on your desk as soon as it is hot off the press.providing expert advice for expert advisors.

B0013FXWU6|3.0|The lead character, Daniel Plainview (played by Day-Lewis), was a rugged individualist that broke his leg in a silver mine, and alone he climbed to the top of the mine shaft and crawled to help. This was a character that we could all admire, almost.<br /><br />It was oil that Plainview would discover in great abunance. Plainview was to become a big oil man.<br /><br />Plainview adopted the orphaned son of a man killed in a drilling accident on one of the oil sites.<br /><br />Plainview had everything going for him, his strong will, his ambition, his willingness to call another man's son his own. But I guess that it is too much to ask the director to bring out the best qualities in the people portrayed in There Will Be Blood. Instead, Anderson wanted to show the weakness in Plainview.<br /><br />We can all expect that a big oil man to show his greed, and political correctness will do its all to bring the rugged individualist down. However, Anderson went overboard in bringing out the negative in Plainview. What started as a remarkable and promising character (Plainvien), ended with complete failure.<br /><br />Plainview disowns his son. By the end of the film, Plainview was a murder not once, but twice. Even the preacher, Eli, revealed himself to be a fake, before Plainview killed him by beating him over the head with a bowling pin.<br /><br />This is not a film about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of extreme adversity. This film is about the failure of the human spirit. Some Greek tragedies work as entertainment. But this film did not work for me. I don't find failure to be entertaining!

The purpose of the book is to analyse current issues from both an academic and a practical perspective.<br /><br />The commentaries are set out in 12 chapters from 16 distinguished contributors who are renowned scholars and professionals engaged in business and financial laws. Three practice areas are covered: corporate law, financial law and mergers and acquisitions. The authors cover these areas thoroughly, and provide a practical perspective plus relevant political implications in a worrying area of the world.<br /><br />Issues covered include director liability and minority shareholder protection from a comparative perspective, paying special attention to the dynamic practice area of acquisitions and mergers. The book offers useful commentary on how policies are shaped and the building of institutions and it achieves these aims very well in our view.<br /><br />Additional topics covered within Korean financial law include private equity, structured finance and foreign financial institutions, As Kim says, the book provides \\"a grand picture of the Korean business and financial sector that allows readers to compare and understand Korea's position in connection with the global advancement of business and financial law\\".<br /><br />We welcome this thought-provoking title as a great introduction to those new to both the country itself and how its own legal system for business is structured so you have some idea of how to do business the Korean way.siness the Korean way.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I heard of the book on a podcast, and bought a copy to read on an upcoming vacation.  Got through it in two days, and bought the sequel \\"The Ghost Brigades\\".  Got through that in two more days.<br /><br />I rate this book highly, but realize it depends on tastes.  This was right up my alley, and in no small way reminded me of adventuresome science fiction I read in my early 20's and 30's.  In particular, it reminded of of both Heinlein and Niven.  Adventure, science, great characters, new frontiers, etc.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in recommending this to any person who likes them things.
1846611156|5.0|PRACTICAL ADVICE ON HOW TO RUN A FATAL ACCIDENT CASE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The President of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL), Patrick Allen, rightly describes fatal accident claims as one of the biggest challenges for personal injury lawyers.  And he is absolutely right! The new, second edition of the APIL Guide to Fatal Accidents by Gordon Exall gives excellent practical advice on how to run a case involving a fatal accident and how to secure maximum awards for the family, friends and the estate of the deceased person.<br /><br />As Allen says, not only do the tragic circumstances of a matter require the utmost exercise of personal client skills but the law itself is both complex and difficult. Most lawyers have the difficult task of explaining to clients that the damages awarded are generally modest and sometimes not awarded at all. So the level of the award and the painstaking (and often emotionally charged) work involved is required to be completed to adduce damage which can be an aggravating factor for clients.<br /><br />Gordon Exall is up to the task and he takes us through all that is required in a fatal accident claim from the first interview onwards, covering funding, taking instructions, an analysis of the claim, and the application of the law. He also covers the complexities of limitation, dependency and the effect of benefits with lucid explanation illustrated by current case-law. Amazingly, in just over 300 pages, Exall takes us on a tour of the subject in 26 chapters with 6 excellent appendices including the legislation and Ogden Tables.<br /><br />The second edition contains new chapters which deal with multipliers and damages in anticipation and the title also gives advice on dealing with the coroners' court, courtesy of Paul Balen which is most helpful but the subject area does need to be monitored because of potential changes in this jurisdiction.<br /><br />The final word can be left with Patrick Allen who describes the guide as \\"a model of clarity and practical application for lawyers trying to find their way through the maze of law and procedure relating to fatal claims\\".<br /><br />Very well put, and like Allen, we also cannot recommend it too highly!.<br /><br />The final word can be left with Patrick Allen who describes the guide as \\"a model of clarity and practical application for lawyers trying to find their way through the maze of law and procedure relating to fatal claims\\".<br /><br />Very well put, and like Allen, we also cannot recommend it too highly!
B0065IBZI2|5.0|Kate Bush has always made the path not followed someone else's and this collection is no exception. It is slower, moodier and more cryptic than almost all \\"Holiday\\" albums.  To me it is like walking through a snowy forest at night. The shadows hiding some of the detail but the snow reflecting the blue light of the sky.  Its a time when your emotions ebb and flow and your imagination continues to ask \\"what if\\".  There are not flashy tricks or gimmicks but the whole album is a rich and rewarding experience if you let your mind wander along with Kate's without preconcieved notions or short-sighted judgements...enjoy the journey.
019538606X|5.0|NATURAL RESOURCES?  LEAVE `EM ALONE! AND GRANT THEM THE LEGAL RIGHT OF NONUSE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This important book from the Oxford University Press offers a new perspective on the law and policy of nature and the conservation of resources. It could well be destined to become a classic in environmental law.  What humans need to do to protect the environment, as the publishers explain, is to grant natural resources the legal right to be left alone - a law of nonuse.<br /><br />The observation here is that environmental law generally, has been only partially effective in protecting the environment and preventing catastrophic environmental damage. Why? Because it is fundamentally anthropocentric, rather than eco-centric: created for the benefit of humans first, in other words, rather than the environment upon which humans depend for their existence.<br /><br />Author Jan Laitos, an expert and theorist in environmental law from the University of Denver, argues that instead of giving humans the right to clean up the environment with a view to resource conservation, the resource itself should have the \\"right of nonuse\\"; in other words, the right to be left alone - a right that should ultimately be legitimated in the courts.<br /><br />If all this sounds a bit New Age, Utopian and rather American West Coast, it's not necessarily a new idea.  The thought does occur that it derives partly from the thinking that inspired the creation of national parks, a concept that originated in the United States of America in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Yellowstone and Yosemite and their like would not have existed without the strenuous efforts of conservationists such as John Muir, to conserve vast tracts of magnificent wilderness by leaving them alone - with minimal supervision and protected by law, for the benefit of future generations.<br /><br />It can be no accident that from these beginnings, there gradually emerged the concept of \\"standings for non-human plaintiffs\\", first expounded, according to the author, in Professor Stone's now well-known 1972 California Law Review article: \\"Should Trees Have Standing - Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects.\\"<br /><br />So should trees have rights?<br /><br />Yes, says Stone, having  pointed out that there are lots of inanimate rights holders: trusts, corporations, municipalities, ships, even nation states to name a few, which have been given legal standing in courts.  The environment, asserts Laitos, `should (similarly) be given standing in its own right in the courts... against the effects of human resource activity... and represented in court by a guardian similar to a guardian ad litem.<br /><br />This is only one example -- gleaned from this eminently readable and fascinating book - of Laitos's talent for building a case for new departures in environmental law.  Backed up by extensive and impressive research, his various arguments and insights are by turns startling, persuasive and ultimately convincing, as he challenges much current thinking in ecological management.<br /><br />A boon to researchers, the book is extensively footnoted and contains at least six pages of relevant cases.  Environmental lawyers should certainly read this book, as should all environmentalists looking for innovative and original perspectives in this often controversial field.ings, there gradually emerged the concept of \\"standings for non-human plaintiffs\\", first expounded, according to the author, in Professor Stone's now well-known 1972 California Law Review article: \\"Should Trees Have Standing - Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects.\\"<br /><br />So should trees have rights?<br /><br />Yes, says Stone, having  pointed out that there are lots of inanimate rights holders: trusts, corporations, municipalities, ships, even nation states to name a few, which have been given legal standing in courts.

1846612047|5.0|A SHORT, YET DETAILED, EXPLANATION OF THE COMPLEX MANAGEMENT OF CATASTROPHIC<br />INJURY CLAIMS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />A splendid group of contributors have been assembled for this publication to produce an excellent short guide on the complex subject of the management of catastrophic injury claims in association with the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL).<br /><br />Graham Aldous QC, Peter Andrews QC, Stuart McKechnie and Terry Lee examine the detailed and continuing care and rehabilitation regimes covered in 18 chapters and in just over 400 pages.<br /><br />The authors review the sophisticated case management requirements covering technical procedure matters with the significant use of expert evidence as well as the complicated settlements and financial structures including periodical payments orders.<br /><br />In the Foreword, the then APIL President, Muiris Lyons. describes the guide as invaluable for anyone handling catastrophic injury claims, being both welcome and overdue.  It is particularly useful for APIL to be associated with this publication from Jordans because the nature of catastrophic injury claims involve acting for the most severely injury individuals and their families.<br /><br />Lyons describes this authoritative guide as a roadmap for the successful pursuit of these difficult claims capturing, as it does, a wealth of knowledge and experiences as it goes on its way.<br /><br />There are 3 aspects which Lyons, in his own words, highlights about the book:<br /><br />* It provides a unique insight into what is actually required from the PI lawyer when dealing with the client and the family.  And at the heart if it is the bond of trust required for the claim to be successfully pursued;<br /><br />* Recognition for the guide's medical content which go to the fundamental parts of the claim; and<br /><br />* Material relevant to clinical negligence claims as well as personal injury claims.<br /><br />This edition covers the following areas as there were in 2010: the Civil Procedure Rules; the Rehabilitation Code; the development of Court Case Management functions, particularly in clinical negligence cases; changes in the funding of claims, including CFAs; the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and changes in the Court of Protection; Alternative Dispute Resolution methods including Mediation; and the Damages Act, Periodical Payment Orders and the challenges facing Claimants in damages management.<br /><br />We have found this guide an excellent exposition of how to approach catastrophic injury claims but there has been so much recent change that readers must be aware that the title is rapidly becoming a bit dated so we look forward to a new edition to update the main subject areas.as well as personal injury claims.<br /><br />This edition covers the following areas as there were in 2010: the Civil Procedure Rules; the Rehabilitation Code; the development of Court Case Management functions, particularly in clinical negligence cases; changes in the funding of claims, including CFAs; the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and changes in the Court of Protection; Alternative Dispute Resolution methods including Mediation; and the Damages Act, Periodical Payment Orders and the challenges facing Claimants in damages management.<br /><br />We have found this guide an excellent exposition of how to approach catastrophic injury claims but there has been so much recent change that readers must be aware that the title is rapidly becoming a bit dated so we look forward to a new edition to update the main subject areas.

006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium was an emotional punch to the gut from the moment I opened the book the second I slammed it closed and threw it on the bed in an \\"OMG WHAT THE CRAP JUST HAPPENED\\" moment.  Even though I was kind of expecting the ending, thinking it was coming and reading the way that Lauren Oliver delivered it was two completely different things.  Lauren Oliver just knows how to throw emotions in your face and leave you gasping.<br /><br />I really loved that in Pandemonium Lena had to really discover how unbelievably strong she is.  She had to learn to survive and to become someone she never thought she could be.  She had to reinvent herself.  She stood up for what she believed in, even if that meant she had to stand up against people she cared about, which is something I really respect.<br /><br />There was some really tough moments in Pandemonium.  I had a hard time reading about the struggles some of them went through in the wilds, like the starvation.  There is one scene of grief  (I won't spoil who it was for) that just tore my heart out!!<br /><br />Pandemonium was action, suspense, love, hate, friendship, grief, and reinventing yourself to become who you were meant to be.  With another killer ending that leaves us DYING for more, Lauren Oliver once again took my breathe away and I loved Pandemonium even more than I did Delirium.  I can not wait to see what she has in store for us next.

B00005R2M3|4.0|Generally this is a pleasant offering. The production is on point and the lyrics are nice. The thing that gets in the way of this being a perfect 4 star offering is a big thing -- Shakira's voice. Sometimes in songs such as \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" it's quite pleasant. Even sexy. But on more occasion than one it's more than I can take. It's thin and whiny. But it is still nice listening to what she has to say. Some of my favorites on the CD are \\"Whenever, Wherever\\", \\"Objection\\" and my main squeeze, the ballad \\"The One\\".<br /><br />The only reason I wouldn't purchase this is because of her voice. There are enough strong songs to hold this release up really but annoying vocals are just too much to take. \\"Poem To A Horse\\" has some of the worst vocals because she goes on and on extending her vocal runs and it grates. What kind of a song title is that anyway? Do I recommend this? Yes and no. If you're already a fan you probably already have this. But if you don't then listen to  90 second samples on iTunes (or the full album on Spotify) and then decide.<br /><br />3.8 stars.

It has some weight to it, but not uncomfortable-I am not a heavy or large frame guy (5'8\\" 160 lbs). I liked the black face with the yellow hand and it was priced very well on Amazon (where I first viewed). However, since I was going on vacation to Aruba in a few months I waited, figuring I would get a good, no-tax deal there. I couldn't find the black face I was looking for but either way, the ones which were available were $400 +/-. I ordered from Amazon as soon as I got back. I've had it now for 3 months. It keeps excellant time, looks great and I feel good when I wear it- I have no regrets.

0316228532|3.0|I bought this book the day it came out. I just finished it and I can honestly write that I struggled to finish it as I found myself<br />feeling very frustrated, bored and listless while I turned the pages.<br /><br />Other reviews note what I felt during my reading of this book. I spent way too much time trying to keep up with the characters as they<br />seemed to come from every direction. I never felt much care or concern for any of the characters (Miles, Shirley, Mary, Samantha, Kay,<br />Krystal, etc...) and not caring much about them meant I just lost interest in the book. What was the message? I am still not sure as<br />the book starts off interestingly enough as Barry Fairbrother suddenly dies at a country club on his anniverary. I figured that meant<br />there would be all types of political backstabbing as others in the small town of Pagford would then fight for his spot.<br /><br />Instead, I spent the time reading the book trying to figure out if JK Rowling was writing a book about the economic problems of England<br />or the social problems or real estate issues (maybe all of that?). I just know I was so disappointed in the book. I also got real tired<br />of the \\"F\\" word that seemed to be on the tip of her pencil for every page. Okay, I get it. The poor people in the book like that word.<br />I get it. Enough. It was an example to me that Rowling wanted to distance herself from her Harry Potter books (and great books at that!)<br />but it was like reading a social work assessment at times (read the book to learn about the Weedon family as my example) and too much<br />of \\"over the top\\" out of control deviant behavior from too many people.<br /><br />I just do not understand the purpose behind this book. What was the message? Who knows. Who cares. I read the book and now I just feel<br />that JK Rowling swung and missed big time on her first \\"adult\\" novel. One additional note: With so many characters in the book it would<br />have been nice to have a genogram(s) of the various families and individuals so I could refer to it while I was reading the book. Then again,<br />there is the problem. Too much of my time was spent asking myself, \\"Okay, now who is this again? \\"Why are they mad again?\\" etc....<br /><br />Three stars? I'm being generous. I would probably give it 2.5 stars if that was possible.
B005636HPS|5.0|Love it!  Fabulous album from awesome group!  Party rockin in the house tonight!  Everybody just have a good time!  Love all the songs!  Love the format!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger games was the best book ever!! Suzanne collins totally did a great job on this book!! I still can't get over thresh dying he was my favorite:(
B000K7MMP4|2.0|I could not even finish episode one! I have seen many versions of P&P the very first being the 1940 Greer Garson, Lawrence Olivier version which even though it is heavily edited and incorrectly costumed is so superior to this version I am surprised people here speak so highly of this version. Such dreadful acting; artificial, overdone and unnatural. Mrs. Bennett is NOTHING like the character in the novel at all, nor is Mr. Bennett.UGH maybe if I had seen this before all others but I really think if I had I might never have even read the book at all. The only reason I give even two stars is the costuming is quite good. Too bad I cannot say the same for the acting!<br /><br />Even being able to watch it for free as an Amazon Prime member cannot induce me to finish this...simply dreadful.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is easy and hard and fun.  I love the way it continues to \\"run\\" when you turn the game off.  The kindle fire rocks!
0061780308|2.0|I did not expect to contain 75% Sadness.  As a result, even though the ending was positive, I would not recommend the book.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I love this movie.  No other version of Annie has ever topped this one!  I have watched it alone, with my children and grandchildren.  We enjoy each and every time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|absolutely love this app including the audio readings and ability to take notes and highlight.  thanks to whoever created it :)
B0002KVUKM|5.0|The people posting negative reviews can't seem to get past the fact this is a MOVIE that is strictly for ENTERTAINING and FUN.  And it meets that criteria in an over-the-top, darkly atmospheric way.  Lots of spooky castles and woods, mythological monsters and personalities, good-looking girls and guys, and all-around great Halloween entertainment.  That said, my least enjoyed part of it were the brides of Dracula; they were just ridiculous but maybe that was intentional to up the campy factor.  If that's my worst complaint about the whole movie, then it's still a rousing success with me.  Grade A!
0984334904|5.0|These flash cards are absolutely AMAZING they have everything you could ever need on them! They are made of high quality material so they glide nice and don't stick together when studying! They include similar kanji on them so you don't confuse the two which has helped me so much! I honestly couldn't say anything bad about them. They were so thoughtfuly designed to make your life easier. I initially thought to myself \\"...this is a bit much for flashcards, I should just make them myself, mine would accomplish the same task anyway\\", BUT since receiving them I have been happy with every penny spent on them.  You cant make your own flashcards this good (without many hours wasted) they are absolutely wonderful. They are perfect for anyone and everyone learning japanese! I highly recommend them!
B00846REIS|4.0|The book was great. Simply a page turner. However, I didn't care for da ending. Although I know it was setting da stage for da next sequel.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and absolutely loved it! One of the must have movies so right after i watched it i preordered it on amazon.<br />When I opened up the packaging I was in disbelief. The discs were stacked one on top of another so that there were 4 disks in 2 slots. A real pain to get out and i'm pretty sure that I am going to end up with scratched disks because of this poor packaging. I completely regret getting the 4 disc copy due to how much I loved the movie.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Kristen Stewart is pretty terrible, and she's on screen almost the entire movie. The visuals are stunning, however. Overall, this is skippable but not quite a waste of time.
0425263908|5.0|This Book was a good read I read it in two days!! I couldn't put the book down!! Kind of had same story line as Fifty Shades of Grey. It kept me from rereading Fifty again can't wait to buy the next book!!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|This movie is amazing.  Excellent actors and excellent writers.<br /><br />I am unable to purchase the more expensive DVD/Blu-Ray set at this time which means I'm missing out on the cool features like the gag reel and deleted scenes.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player so I don't know why I'd buy a combo with both the DVD and that. It just makes me mad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun game, and the ads so far have not been to obnoxious.  I like the levels of deals and the ease of customization.  Very good at this price.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Gottatellya, I love the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child. They are way beyond brain candy. Jack Reacher is like this 6' 6\\" ex Military Policeman who roams the country on foot with nothing but the clothes on his back, a toothbrush, and an ATM card. He buys a new clothes ever three days and throws the old ones away. WhattaGuy!!<br /><br />He doesn't take any crap from anybody either. In this book one of the character says something like \\"You don't like to be pushed around, do you?\\" Jack says \\"I don't know, I've never been pushed around. If I do, I'll let you know if I like it or not.\\" He had lots better experiences as a high school freshmen than some of us did is all I have to say.<br /><br />In this book Jack is hitchhiking in the midwest on his way to to Virginia to meet a woman he has never met. He gets picked up by two men and a woman who are wearing identical shirts. At first he figures they are part of some sort of corporate team building group but as they travel on he figures out differently. In the meantime  a man is brutally murdered and a cocktail waitress is abducted bringing in the FBI in the form of a semi hot Agent named Julia Sorenson.<br /><br />Well before this book is out Jack Reacher has to deal with not only the FBI, the CIA, Homeland Security, and a bunch of Syrians he also gets to cop a feel of Agent Sorenson's wrist that almost makes him swoon.<br /><br />So does Jack deal with all this and still get his unseen woman in Virginia, or does Agent Sorenson or the Syrians, or the CIA dissuade him? Does he finally get pushed around? Read the book to find out.<br /><br />I love Jack Reacher, I give this book four stars out of five.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't remember the last time I read a book for fun, but this trilogy changed that very quickly for me.  I was hooked on this series and was upset when I had to stop reading to go to work and to sleep.  I managed to read the set in 5 days and was sad when it ended.  I would recommend these books to anyone.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What if you could go back in time somehow, would you do it? What about if you could go back and time and change history by preventing an assassination, specifically John F. Kennedy's murder on November 22, 1963? Would things be better or worse now if you did that? Would the Vietnam War been averted? What if you couldn't go back to any day you wanted, you had to go back to 1958 and bide your time until 1963?<br /><br />You know something, five years is a long time to be biding time, and you would have to eat. You couldn't take your 2012 money back in time, that would raise a few eyebrows wouldn't it? You would have to get a job to earn some money to eat and have a place to sleep. Of course, you could make some spectacularly successful bets on horses and sports in general.<br /><br />Five years is a long enough time that you might meet somebody and fall in love. You might like your new life. What then? Would you want to return to the present day?<br /><br />You might also find out that maybe the past doesn't want to be changed. It's obdurate.<br /><br />This might be Stephen King's best novel. It's huge, it takes a while to read. But I loved it.<br /><br />Five stars out of five.

0439023491|5.0|I like the 1st and the last book the most.  This book was a little dragging on for me but still a must read if you are reading the trilogy
B005ZUR724|4.0|awesome! takes wow into ur palm. great stuff. keep this going and u get 5 stars! good luck and God bless
034580404X|5.0|If you like a good romance book with a perfect hot guy, action and very descriptive sex scenes this book is for you. Improved my sex life big time!
0062082353|5.0|This is an outstanding book by a man that lived on the brink of death every day.  He did it for the love of his Country and his fellow Soldiers.  This book should be required reading in every High School in America ( and every liberal minded anti military type ).  This is what being a Patriot is all about.  Unfortunately there are not enough like him in our Country today.  God Bless our Troops!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you like Twilight, this is the book for you!  It has action and romance and also two very handsome young guys.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love having access and ability to download to my tablet<br />..  it is realiable and simple to u and I'm excited to become more savvy with the app.
0439023513|5.0|If you like twilight you'll love this book.  I was actualy suprised at the ending and a bit disappointed (in a good way).
B0040Z9H5K|1.0|Nobody watches action films for dialogue, but it has to have a solid story and decent dialogue to go with it. That's what made movies like Bourne Identity so great.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was  very impressed with the writers views and assessments  We as civilians take to much  for granted the work   an sacrifices  the people in the military  take  thank you all
B003719GGS|5.0|This book was a gift to my fiance who absolutely loved it. It has now become its reference in dealing with our relationship and our differences in the way we show love to one another.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|KISSES ON THE BOTTOM<br /><br />A few weeks ago we were lucky enough to stumble across the taping of this CD and sat entranced and amazed watching McCartney and friends work together.  How lucky we were to find this show, seeing Sir Paul, Eric Clapton, Diana Krall and many more artists combine their creative and varied talents together to make a great recording!!!!<br /><br />These songs date back to Paul McCartney's parents era -- they are bluesy, mellow, and sweet, the lyrics are reminiscent of a more innocent and wonderful time.  Many we are familiar with and could sing along with immediately -- and others were a new treat.<br /><br />I've always been interested in Diana Krall, yet never had or took the opportunity to find out more about her work and music. However, now that her and McCartney worked their magic together she has a new fan or two! This CD is a work of many artists who jam well together and make this a listening experience one won't soon forget.  I find myself singing these songs throughout my day; granted, not as good as McCartney, but they are fun and memorable.<br /><br />Paul still has it big time and this CD proves that over and over again.  There are fourteen songs.  The music is sweet and some of them ring sentimental and bring a tear or two to your eye.  One of my favorites is ALWAYS, another is AC-CENT-TCHU-ATE THE POSITIVE.<br /><br />I love this CD and am very happy to encourage you to listen to it.  The mix of jazz, blues, and older song creations just works and very well at that. Add Paul McCartney's voice to this mix and you just can't go wrong.<br /><br />This CD comes highly recommended!<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Pam
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Loved the perspective it was written from, the multiple dynamics of the the characters and the way it was written.  Great read!  Looking forward to the movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Interesting story told as one good friend would tell another.  The author intoduces himself well, creates a bond and conveys his message clearly and concisely.  With his background and training what would you expect?<br /><br />Great read, makes you proud of the men and women protecting us from not only our enemies abroad, but from our polititicans distortians at home.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|fun game.  keeps you on your toes!!!  I like that you use the whole map throughout the game.  good graphics and good puzzles!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I don't use any other headphones then these.<br />they fit perfect and the sound is excellent.<br />I hope they never stop selling them in case<br />I need another set in the future.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I think this mixtape showed some growth and deeper meaning from frank. It was like a personal tour into his life. dope beats. Pyramid was a liking. Also Crack Rock, personally.
0449012751|5.0|Poignant is the only world to describe this story. It's a very simple tale, beautifully told and my only disappointment is that it's Rachel Joyce's debut novel so she doesn't have any other books on the market for me to devour. She does an incredible job slowly rolling out the details to a man's life, to his marriage, to the failures that haunt him. As he goes on his pilgrimage and finds himself alone with himself, away from the noise and busyness we all tend to fill our days with, he finds memories long forgotten coming back to him, informing his journey and his view of the world, his wife and his life. And yet, despite the sometimes painful pieces of his puzzle, the story itself is infused with a gentleness, a lightness. I highly recommend this read.<br /><br />The narration is perfect and the performance adds to the story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a must have app. I use it on my Kindle Fire. It lets me know how much battery life is available and it even breaks it down to the time available for listening to music, reading or web browsing.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I would recommend this book to just about anybody. From the moment I picked it up I actually had trouble putting it down. The only problem I had with the book was that I couldn't figure out what was going to happen in the end, which really isn't a bad thing at all. The ending was completely Aa surprise to me, although I figured out what people/person where behind it from the very beginning.<br />if you're going to buy a book, by this one. You won't regret it at all, unless you don't like mysterys or thriller's then I do not recoment you buy this.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I thought that the music was so brilliantly put together, I've been playing the music from this soundtrack non stop for days already! Get this soundtrack, you truly won't regret it.
B008CRC506|5.0|I literally cannot get enough of Smash. I continue to re-watch the episodes and always enjoy the experience. I love all the singing, dancing and acting. I think that Katharine Mcphee and Megan Hilty are amazing leads and are great at portraying different aspects of the very complex Marilyn Monroe. I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out and for Season 1 to be released onto DVD.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its a fun game. a really great way to kill time. only suggestion is having a higher limit than 45 coins.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Since I saw this movie in the theater, I have continued to describe it as amazing and disturbing. It is hard to watch what the kids have to go through in this movie, but the actors, the directing and the rest of the story is amazing. I cannot wait for the rest of the trilogy to come out. Hopefully, they will be able to live up to the high expectation that was set in this movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|Short version of a Indiana Jones run its fun quick and does require some skills.  Again not too intimidating but fun.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|Like Snark Busters 1 and 2 and Twisted Lands Shadow Town, this is a nice loooong game with lots of puzzles, hidden objects, and gorgeous graphics.  Yes, you do have to pay another buck early on, but that's less than $2 for a game that I'd pay $4 for.  It's unfortunate that Alawar doesn't just charge $1.99 up front, because although it is easily worth that, people don't like the feeling of a bait and switch.  Terrific game, as long as you know going in that it will cost $2 and not $1.
B005HSL626|4.0|Good for all ages simple and yet fun it makes a nice change to other games. All ages can enjoy this one.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I started reading this book and kept waiting for the heat.  I asked other women if it was me or was it the book. They said it was the book.  If you have ever read Zane, Eric Jerome Dickey or E Lynn Harris, then this book will seem tame to you!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game if u are just looking for something to do. worth downloading and a great time waster. pretty realistic.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Loved this book. I was so caught up in the story had to keep reading to find out what was on the next page!!! It kept my interest and had me puzzling over why things happened and what was going to pop off the page next. Never have read anything quite like it and will definitely read other books by this author.
B007CKNX28|1.0|Just saw Jack White at Radio City, and paid a fair amount of money for the tickets.  He played a 45-60 min set, with no encore.  There are theories that he wasn't happy with audience dancing levels or with the venue itself, and he started out the show by preemptively jabbing the audience for being an NPR crowd.  Whatever - for him to rip off his fans like that is totally unprofessional and his fans should consider his obvious contempt and/or lack of respect for them before giving him their money.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is wonderful!  Alfie Boe alone is worth the purchase of this DVD.  I've watched it over and over and still loving it.
B0085KGHI6|3.0|Unfortunatelly, the product I purchased is incompatible with the brasilian sistem. The CD works well, but<br />the DVD is from a different region and when we put on gives a message \\"wrong region\\".I did not know that<br />could be happen, I have thougt that there was only one universal sistem, so it is very important that this<br />information appears very clearly besides the announcement about the product.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|STAY AWAY!!  I would give this game 0 stars if it let me.  This is actually a good idea and fun to play UNTIL it screws up.  You play to win coins to purchase things.  You can also spend hard cash on coins.  The second day of playing I noticed a couple of items I had purchased had disappeared.  The next day, 16,000 coins disappeared.  The next day, another 4,000 coins were gone.  STAY AWAY!!!
B008CP93S0|2.0|Not worth the time. Good actors but that's about it - I expected more, especially after watching the funny preview. I stopped watching after a while....
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Following suit with the other reviews, I do believe one, two or three teenage girls wrote this as a collective dream scene, perhaps to determine want they think kinky sex would be like after some teenage boy told them that girls climax at the drop of a hat, \\"like EVERYTIME EVERYWHERE\\".  It is pure fantasy, extremely repetative on the sex scenes (which you can just skip as they are all pretty much the same) and completely unrelalist on multiple levels. Can't wait to see how they make this into a movie;  it wouldnt be hard to cast Cristian Grey as every young good looking male actor on the planet would love to be him,at least in a dream,  but the female role would be a huge stretch since 90% of what she does is writhe around climaxing every five minutes, and the other 10% is sucking on her lower lip. OH and word of advice,  if you read this on a KINDLE on a plane ...beware of the person(s) in the seat right next to you.  Weird looks are rampant!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I love the TV show Bones.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was available on Amazon Video at a great price.  I can access it any time and watch as many times as I want.
0811879542|5.0|I know the age for this product is 2+ but when I found it on amazon when looking for presents for my girl turning 1, I thought it was neat and put it on her wish list, thinking if she didn't get it for her birthday she could get it for Christmas or next years birthday - or sometime I would just get it. Well, my mom got it for her 1 year birthday. It took a little time but within a few months or less (I didn't read it every night but I did read it some here and there), she was picking this book off her shelf at night and sitting down, turning the pages, pressing the dot on her own, then eventually lifted the book to give to me then stood up to get in my lap, like, \\"Okay, read it to me now.\\" - As time has passed and I have read it to her more and more at her request, she has learned to do more and more of the commands. Now she is even blowing on the pages and clapping when it says to. It is so cute how much she loves it! I can tell it amuses her. She does get a little impatient with the pages where you have to press EVERY dot....and I don't make her do it; I do it, unless she is cooperative then I'll press her fingers on the dots until she protests. But at the beginning of the book, I don't even read \\"press here\\" before she is pressing the dot. She even knows to tap on the dot when you have to tap on it lol. And she is amused when I have to shake the book. So this book is even for young ones. My 7 year old daughter even took it to her room to read it (and play with it -it was very amusing to her). I am going to get this book for my nieces for Christmas (5 and 4) - my mom thinks they might be too old but I think this book is fun for almost any age.<br /><br />I wanted to get this for my  nieces for Christmas but I went to order and it says it takes 1-3 months before shipping! I would really like to get this in time for Christmas but it looks like that isn't going to work :(
B0031RS4UM|4.0|New to Lee Childs - Jack Reacher series. Not dissimilar to the Don Pendleton - Executioner style of anti hero. Interesting change to have ex -Military policeman rather that civilian police officer righting wrongs, somewaht reluctantly to be sure, but persuaded none the less. Right guy, wrong place, right time scenarios. No ambivalence in conscience for him, as a result of his actions. Is this the result of army training or his life training? Does the reader get a guilty pleasure from his swift justice? You bet.<br />Still the bad guys waffle on as usual, are as incompetent as usual, and he lives to play another day, if they were half as efficient as he is, there wouldn't have been a book 2 etc...do we care, not much. It's the story ideas that keep us interested.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|The controls are so unresponsive. I can't even finish the first level. Waste of money. Even the free trial of cordy is much better for controls and smoothness of gameplay
B008OOYALE|2.0|This app started out really fun, but when they updated it they force you to use the social feature or spend real money to expand your island. This app is exactly what I wanted, except you can't progress without spending money and that is a deal breaker for me.

B0058YPL66|5.0|\\"Where are we going?\\", a tearful Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) asks as her fairy-tale world is obliterated by an unholy curse. \\"Somewhere horrible,\\" her Stepmother, the Evil Queen  Regina (Lana Parrilla) declares in wicked triumph, \\"Somewhere absolutely horrible!\\"<br />  Thus, Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, creators of \\"Lost\\", trap beloved fairy-tale characters between two worlds; literally stuck in time and space, in the ingenious series \\"Once Upon A Time.\\" The horrible place they are all going is our \\"Real World\\"; A Land Without Magic.\\" The enchanted fairy tale kingdom is transformed into Storybrooke, Maine. Everyone is suffering from a 28 year case of amnesia; without any memories of their identities or past lives. Everyone except, of course, Regina and the devilish, devious Rumpilstilskin (Robert Carlyle), who is known as Mr. Gold in Storybrooke. Regina installs herself as the despotic mayor of Storybrooke and believes she holds all the cards. But Mr. Gold has a few nasty tricks up his sinister sleeve as well.<br />  Regina certainly hadn't counted on her adopted son Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) traveling up to Boston to find his biological mother Emma (Jennifer Morrison). Henry arrives with a huge \\"Once Upon A Time\\" Storybook. He insists that fairy tales are real,  and tells Emma that she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Moreover, Henry relates, Emma is the only one who can break the Storybrooke curse. At first, Emma thinks Henry is fairy-tale crazy. But, upon arrival in Storybrooke, she finds it impossible to leave. An all out war between Regina and Emma is quickly declared; with  Emma seriously doubting she is the chosen one to break the curse. Meanwhile, Snow White is now schoolteacher Mary Margaret Blanchard. Her Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) is a \\"John Doe\\" named David Nolan. Having spent the majority of the curse in a coma, David wakes up to find himself with a wife named Katherine he has no memory of; but he knows he loves Mary Margaret. Regina, of course, will stop at nothing to keep them apart; going so far as to frame Mary Margaret for Katharine's murder and locking her up in jail.<br />  \\"Time\\" moves deftly and expertly between the two alternate worlds of Storybrooke and the Enchanted Fairy Tale Kingdom. Kitsis and Horowitz are wise and careful not to reveal too much character back-story or motivation too soon; making the series a truly addictive experience. Late in the season, in the episode \\"The Stable Boy\\", we do learn that Regina's hatred of Snow White is tragically mis-directed. This gives Regina  layers  of depth and pathos; without ever excusing her murderous actions in the earlier episodes \\"The Thing You Love Most\\" and \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter.\\" Other fairy tale characters, such as Jiminey Cricket, Pinocchio, Gepetto,  Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, and Belle, also appear in a few episodes. \\"Red-Handed\\", the series spin on \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\", is just  plain weird.<br />  As the \\"villains\\" of \\"Time\\", Lana Parrilla and Robert Carlyle are outstanding. And you'll root for Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas as the separated Snow White-Prince Charming/Mary Margaret Blanchard-David Nolan. Goodwin is particularly effective as a feisty, self-aware Snow White. As her Prince \\"James\\"  Charming, Josh Dallas is every bit as courageous, dashing and devoted as we could wish for.<br />  The episodes \\"Pilot\\", \\"7:15 A.M.\\", \\"Skin Deep\\",\\"  The Stable Boy\\"  and the intense Season Finale \\"A Land Without Magic\\"  include optional audio commentaries. Disc 5 contains several entertaining Behind The Scenes extras.Regina, of course, will stop at nothing to keep them apart; going so far as to frame Mary Margaret for Katharine's murder and locking her up in jail.<br />  \\"Time\\" moves deftly and expertly between the two alternate worlds of Storybrooke and the Enchanted Fairy Tale Kingdom.

B007KZY1YY|2.0|Just like the first book, not much happens in the second one either! Funnily enough, it keeps you wanting to read more to see if the mystery of the protagonist would be revealed! It is one of those books that would not stay after finishing but would also keep you turning pages!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was so cool!  I really felt like a detective. I can't wait for part two!<br />I will definitely make that purchase!
B0077PBPY6|5.0|I have read Birdong twice and have seen the blu ray version once.<br />The video version adhered to Sebastian Faulks novel as close as possible except for some parts which were left out fortunately it is forgiving to the overall story and the impact is minor. Since I am an advocate Faulks reader I feel the original is best.<br />The actors reflected the characters in the book brilliantly and the director made it alive and true. I congratulate the team for a great movie.<br />OW

B006AN78XS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed [[ASIN:B005MYEQ4U Midnight in Paris]].  I found it charming and transporting to 1920's Paris rainy evenings with my literary idols.  What a great way to forget for a few hours the complications of today's troubles and enjoy the firsthand experience with the classic masters in beautiful paris!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I actually rented it while at school to use as a reward for my highschool students. Even though the movie does not completely follow the book, it is still an excellent story.<br /><br />I only wish amazon offered closed captioning for my deaf students.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I think J K Rowling is a brilliant writer and I would have bought this book if it were $117.99 and written in pencil on toilet paper. It is distressing that readers punish the author for the greed of the publishers. I had no idea what to expect and for some reason I was thinking Agatha Christie or PD James. Truth is, it was more like Salinger or Vonnegut, harsh realism and depressing insight into human weaknesses. The book is gritty, dark, humorous, and too believable. The characters are real, fragile, not likeable, and for the most part doomed. Rowling's writing is seamless and drags you in. Just like Harry Potter, you feel as if you know these people. You wish you could shake them, kill them, or help them. I couldn't put the book down. I can't say I enjoyed it, rather I experienced it and I am sure I will be thinking about it for a long time to come. As I mentioned before, I think Rowling is brilliant and this book solidifies my feelings. She is an amazing author, with an incredible mind. I would highly recommend the book. It is something you shouldn't miss.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Is exactly what I felt after I closed the book. I have no problems with the ending. But the story, the character development is totally lost on me. The story became so disjointed. So many holes in the story, you wonder whatever led up to this piece of event. So many unnecessary deaths here and there with not much substance anymore. I understand the author wants to portray Katniss as broken and as lost as ever, which is already anunderstatement. It could have been a great book, but failed to do so.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's, A Wanted Man, continues to make this reader want more of Jack Reacher.  The plot twists and surprises in this tension filled \\"can't stop reading\\" book are terrific.  Just when we think we know what is going on, a new development occurs.  The detail on firearms, Reacher's inimitable math expressions, and well developed characters serve to entertain and amaze.  Child's Reacher series is definitely not the usual \\"chick\\" reading but this woman has fallen in love!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Do you have a plan for your retirement? A condo, maybe? Las Vegas, Miami, Scottsdale? What about India? It's probably not your first choice. But then it wasn't the first choice for most of the characters in this film, and they still ended up there. Wanna know why?<br /><br />  Evelyn Greenside (played by Judi Dench) is a housewife who was recently widowed. In addition to her grief, her husband's death has left her with massive debts. While discussing her husband's account with a representative of her internet service provider, she causes an abrupt change in tone when she informs the person on the other end of the phone, whose Indian accent is easily noticeable, that her husband is dead. We are later introduced to a High Court judge named Graham Dashwood. Dashwood (played by Tom Wilkinson) is on his way to the most recent in what seems to be an endless series of retirement parties. He's dreading the event a great deal and, rather than suffer through the festivities, he simply says, \\"This is the day\\" as a way of announcing his own retirement and then leaves the party without another word. Next, we have the Ainslies. Douglas Ainslie (played by Bill Nighy) and his wife Jean (played by Penelope Wilton) are exploring a number of less-than-enticing bungalows where they might spend their golden years. They'd hoped for something grander, but invested a large portion of their savings in their daughter's internet business and have yet to see that business turn a profit. Muriel Donnelly (played by Maggie Smith) is a cantankerous former housekeeper who needs a hip replacement but finds the wait, cost, and personnel at her local hospital unappealing. All these characters are made aware, in varying ways, of a seemingly beautiful retirement community in India named The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful. However, when they arrive, they soon find out that Sonny, the hotel's young and enthusiastic manager (played by Dev Patel), has misrepresented the accommodations at the hotel. He neglected to mention the hotel's shabby appearance, failing plumbing, and non-functioning phone service.<br /><br />  Now I failed to introduce two other characters in the story. They are single by choice and have come to India looking for romance. Without cluing you in to the ending, the film avoids the obvious cliche of the two finding love in each other's arms while still allowing them to find contentment. For that reason and others, I loved this film. There are twists, surprises, happy endings, not-so-happy endings. All that merely punctuates the brilliant portrayals offered by a cast that already has many on their respective resumes. The inexplicably optimistic character played by former Slumdog Millionaire and now supporting actor on HBO's The Newsroom, Dev Patel is a constant source of amusement. See this film.ons at the hotel.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Like others have said, slow start but does get moving and pull you in.  There's plenty of great twists and turns.  Especially if you like a good diabolical gal who really puts some extensive brain work in ;).  Some compared this to 50 shades, in my opinion, not much in common there.  Overall I would recommend if you are done with the 50 trilogy grab this one, you'll like it too and you'll read the whole book once you are drawn in for sure!
B008602KQI|5.0|surreal world were revenge is delivered to kids every year in a tournament to the death for a war that ended 75 years before the story starts. Strength of will and determination showcased to the world giving hope to everyone. Great story.

B006FS22Y8|4.0|Missed hearing her vocals-needed something new and fresh from her heart and this was it. Amy was such an amazing talent and so sorry to lose her. Maybe just maybe there will be some other \\" lost\\" music of hers that will finally make it to the studio! Great vocals and all heart on this one..

B003VPWXRO|4.0|It is always refreshing hearing dark stories that have the potential to help others who have similar struggles. I praise Portia for her strength and ability to write about her intense past. Well done.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have tried pretty much all of the most popular Android ebook readers and Kindle is in my experience the most robust and usable of them all. I've even ended up converting my free of DRM books to mobi format to be able to read them using Kindle on my phone and tablet. The turning point with the software was probably when it came possible to use two columns with a tablet device.<br /><br />One thing I would like to see improved in the future versions would be to reduce the size of the top and bottom marginals as now a big portion of the bottom of the screen is unused. Another nice feature would be to select from a few different fonts and maybe have a few more colour themes, for example dark red/orange on black for night reading or being able to adjust the brightness of the font. So far all the Android devices I have used have too bright screens for use in complete darkness and this would help a lot. Currently I am forced to use an app called Screen Filter to make the screen dimmer for night reading.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was looking for a book to read and chose this because of it being on the NY Best Sellers list. I am very glad I did! This book has you worried, mad, frustrated and confused! I was disappointed in how it ended, but it was a great read!
B008B0QH5S|4.0|When you give an album the title of Elysium (similar to heaven), you really have to put your best foot forward. Not quite what happened here. They put together a great collection of songs (with a few rotten apples in the middle); but the arrangements are not the best. Some of the best songs are Invisible, Your Early Stuff, Leaving, A Face Like that, Breathing Space, and Memory of the future. I also like Ego Music and Requiem, but I won't argue that they are great melodies. Now I really have problems with three songs in particular: Winner, Hold On, and Give It a Go.<br /><br />Winner is a concept that has been done a million times before (at every Olympics for that matter) and sadly, better. WInner starts with \\"this is the moment; we'll remember; everyday for the rest of our lives.\\" I got a flashback of Kelly Clarkson's song which goes like this:<br /><br />A moment like this<br />Some people wait a lifetime,<br />For a moment like this<br /><br />I also got a flashback of the Moody Blues \\"This is the moment.\\" If it weren't for this blatant lack of originality (not cool), this song might have some hope.<br /><br />There is one song I dread even more: Hold On. I could not help but here echoes of \\"We are the world.\\" In particular, the chorus has no place on a PSB CD.<br /><br />As mentioned, the arrangements are also a hindrance. Give it a Go, had some potential, but the arrangement of the chorus and the harmonica (is that what it was?) come close to making this song unlistenable. I thought Requiem was a great ending to this CD, until the musical interlude came. It reminded me of the theme song of Charlie's Angels (the TV show). This is not a compliment. Had they deleted that part, the song would have worked perfectly. Other arrangement problems occur in a number of songs that, as another reviewer points out, don't have a proper ending. They just stop. It's as if no one could figure out how to end the song (tip: when you don't know how to end a song the best thing to do is fade out). Finally, Everything means Something is arranged in a manner that is too reminiscent of Madonna's Frozen (a song that I really did not care for.)<br /><br />These major flaws are not enough to make this a Gehenna. Overall, I enjoyed it and will continue to play many of the tracks for years to come.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story is told from the point of view of the pet.  However, don't let that stop you from considering this wonderful story of the love between a man and his dog.  Well no...there is so much more to this book than that.  It is a love story, a racing story, a family tragedy, a family triumph...all as seen through the eyes of a loving pet.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|As many people have said already this box set only contains the broadcast versions. Well I also know these episodes like the back of my hand and cannot watch them with missing segments. No thanks WB! I'd gladly pay close to 200 dollars for the extended episodes in HD. Don't you think the people at Warner who are responsible for making these decisions would realize the fans wouldn't except this??
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app but I gliches a lot but its a awesome game.so if your reading this app you will love it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A great game.  Simple and elegant yet challenging.  Levels are well thought out.  Music sets a relaxing mood.  This game is perfect for casual puzzle enthusiasts.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed all three books in this series. I heard all the hype about it and wanted to see for myself what it was about. It's a great read from start to finish. Get all three books since one picks up where the other leaves off, so it's like one long story. The characters in the book are multi-dimensional and interesting. The writing is excellent and the story is fast-paced and hard to put down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|With this app I can access Pinterest and pin from the web from my computer, smart phone, and Kindle Fire. I have had no problems with the app and I use it a lot. good job.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I play every puzzle game I can get my hands on, but I've never found one with quite this concept.  The objective is this: you are presented with a grid with a few colored dots on it.  Your goal is to connect the colors (e.g. draw a line from one green dot to the other green dot, and from the blue dot to the other blue dot).  When colors cross, they blend (in the normal color-wheel way: e.g. yellow + blue = green).  I know this sounds painfully simple and boring; but it rapidly leads to some devilish, mind-bending puzzle designs that require a great deal of pre-planning.  (The learning curve is steep at times: be prepared to be challenged.)  And to keep things fresh and challenging, variants are gradually introduced (e.g. grid squares that you MUST pass through with a certain color, or that \\"subtract\\" a color from your blend).  Your mind will be expanded at times as you absorb the implications of each new puzzle mechanic.<br /><br />Pigment has a thankfully simple and elegant presentation.  There is no silly \\"story\\" about hamsters or elves, no annoying music-track in the background, no achievements or high scores or social networking.  Just the puzzles.  Perfect.<br /><br />Other reviewers' complaints about a lack of instructions are, in my view, misguided.  Just as in many other games (Portal is a great example), in Pigment you learn by doing.  The game introduces each gameplay concept in such a simple way that there's really only one thing you CAN do.  You face a very sparse puzzle; you try the only obvious maneuver; you see what happens; and you say \\"Oh! I see how that works.\\"  A couple of levels later, the game introduces a new concept in the same way.  In this manner, you gradually learn the game just as easily as (but more satisfyingly than) if there were an instructions screen that told you exactly what to do.<br /><br />[Note to Developer: I would appreciate an \\"undo\\" button in-game, rather than having to pull up my Kindle Fire menu back button; I would alsoappreciate a \\"puzzle reset\\" button.  These are minor gripes but would be fairly common-sense inclusions.]
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I like interesting puzzle games.  Quell has great music and graphics.  Easy enough to get started and challenging enough to keep you going.  Relatively easy to complete the levels but difficult to consistently have perfect scores as you progress through the game.  HIghly recommend and 99 cents is a grest price point
B00884GR0W|5.0|I know that reading this review might not help you... but it is the best app ever created!! take it from me....
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This CD is bomb I listen to this CD all the time and one of my favorite songs on there is I wanna dance wit u. I wish I had brought this one first before I brought the regular one. But it's great. Ladies go.out and buy it. Give ur man a lap dance.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is simply incredible. I mean, free video and music downloads? Heck, I love it! Greatest app I've ever used. Sadly, the update destroyed it, but I looked at one of the other reveiws, and 30 seconds later I had a fixed version. Go to the app, settings, share with friends, and press the website. search freedi, tap it, press download. Easy. Thanks other review dude!

B007MB5OCE|4.0|the old bird flyies the coop on his 100th birthday....what a ride! i was hooked in right up front and pleased to find myself back there in the end. there is no way to sum up this book.make no mistake this is a book about the interaction of people and the randomness of our existence. some people are tragedy magnets, others always seem happy.this book has it all. i tend to be an impatient reader and quite often skim complete chapters once i get the rythum of a writer. i will admit i did some skimming on ceratain character perspectives after the half way point. i was always brought back into the character i had lost interest in for the moment. i will say that i have never enjoyed the last 15% of any book i have ever read than this one. oh boy, what a tale! hilarious to the point of having to stop reading for a few minutes. thanks for the ride you old coot, and you too mr. jonasson.
B000AO4NJA|4.0|This is a disc that should be a part of every American's music library. Its a feel good one for seniors, middle aged, and new music lovers who have never heard of Sam Cook.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I really appreciated this great little book. I have gone back to it many times as I kickstarted a writing project and have even used some of the ideas in my work life. I love that it refers back to screenplays, since that was where I originally got some momentum as a writer. Easy to go back and zip to the spot you need in order to get out of being stuck. Drills down to the core foundational pieces needed for any project. Love it!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This started off seeming like it would be good but it ended up having no storyline. The love triangle disappeared as did everything else and you were left with a constant repeat of nearly identical loves scenes. Severely under whelming.
B005SJIP2S|2.0|Everything has a life.  From flowers to artists to social phenomena.  It grows, it flourishes, it ages well, then it fades, and finally dies.  I've been a hard core Yes fan since 1971, seen every tour from 1973 to 2004, bought nearly every CD and DVD offered, but finally one has to realize that it doesn't work anymore.  I've pretended it hasn't, but it's all gotten very old and very tired.  The staple songs from 1970 through 1984 are still the staples, those songs re-re-re-re-re-re-released so many times that I haven't bothered to count.  I stopped counting personnel changes a long time ago too.  Yes isn't really a band, they are a business.  A name.  A product.  An income.  Just going through the motions.  Over and over and over again.  So bad that even their catalog is too confusing to understand.  And it's embarrassing.  Yes should retire, quietly and gracefully, now, before it turns pathetic.
0425263908|4.0|I imagine most folks are being directed here because they read 50 Shades and are looking for more or in my case - something better. This book fully encompassed what I wished 50 Shades could have been. The writing is much, much better and the nagging annoying inner voice of Anastasia is gone. My biggest gripe with 50 Shades was Anastasia talking like a 15 year old when she was really 21-22. This is not the case here. Eva is more assured of herself, but still vulnerable. Gideon is written more realistically than Christian Grey who truly encompasses fantasy and fantasy only. Gideon is mysterious but he acts how a typical man might who has dealt with the issues he has.<br /><br />I won't get long winded but its definitely worth the read. Please note - this is a series, so the book continues into the next one which is being released Oct 23rd I believe (Reflected in You is the title.) I'll definitely be picking it up. I would give this book 5/5 stars, but I felt some areas were a bit wordy and I hoped for a lot more dialogue - otherwise it was a great read. If you liked 50 Shades or even the Twilight series - this book will be worth the read for you too.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enigmatis: The Ghost of Maple Creek is a fun game with lots of puzzles and hidden objects. The characters are entertaining and the plot line is good.  I am looking forward to the next edition and hopefully many more.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|Spoilers, yadda yadda yadda....<br /><br />Well, if \\"Martyrs\\" has achieved anything, it has finally ruined my interest in extreme forms of the horror genre.  In fact, I think we need a moratorium on labeling films like \\"Martyrs\\" as horror.  It's not a horror film.  I won't call it torture porn, because I doubt anyone is really getting off on it, but it's nothing more or less than torture cinema.  (Fine - call it \\"torture art\\" if you must.  I won't disagree.)  Excepting maybe a minute of the entire film, there's nothing scary about it.  Being scared - what I think of as a Lovecraftian \\"atmosphere of dread\\" - is necessary to a horror film, and is not the same thing as waiting for the next beating or scene of abuse.<br /><br />But what's worse, this movie isn't even tense.  You know what's coming the moment the \\"protagonist\\" discovers the HIDDEN PASSAGE to the SECRET TORTURE DUNGEON - in a moment so absurd that I was even compelled to tell MY DOG that if he ever discovers a hidden passage to a secret torture dungeon to STAY OUT OF IT!  The last half of the film takes a ridiculously long time to get to the inevitable \\"shocking\\" reveal of not-particularly-gory gore.  (I don't understand people who say they fainted or got sick or even felt sick watching these movies.  What is supposed to be the goriest moment movie is almost laughably over-the-top - I would have laughed if I hadn't already had the realization that I just lost 85 precious minutes that could have been better spent on \\"Anchorman\\".)  Maybe it's just the fact that after \\"Audition\\" nothing on film is particularly shocking anymore, but there must be something more than \\"ooh...our heroine is getting punched repeatedly!\\" and \\"a[...] getting her skin cut off!\\" to make a film interesting.<br /><br />The official reason for all the torture just doesn't work for me. It felt tacked on, like the last three seasons of \\"Lost,\\" as if the filmmakers realized that once they got the girl into the aforementioned secret (and stainless steel equipped!) torture dungeon, they actually needed to explain it in some way.  Who put it there?  Why?  And why do they have an elite force of armed French people all dressed in black to kind of keep it secure - but who are apparently on break for the day or so that the heroine and her girlfriend are busy shooting and burying everyone living in the house - innocent children included!  It seems to me that a lot of reviewers (not necessarily here; I don't feel up to browsing the reviews) are too quick to attribute \\"depth\\" and \\"seriousness\\" to any movie with a weird old woman talking nonsense about the meaning of life or death or whatever.  Many of these reviewers are likely the same people who announced that \\"The Matrix\\" \\"really makes you think.\\"  (Wait a minute - wasn't there also a weird old woman in \\"The Matrix\\" who talked nonsense about the meaning of life and death???)  But I just don't buy it.  Thinking about THE BIG REASON for more than few minutes should make clear to almost anyone that it just doesn't add up.  By the admission of the leaders of the SECRET INTERNATIONAL CULT OF OLD PEOPLE (forgot to mention that too - another head-shakingly absurd moment), they have no good reason for doing any of this.  I'm not even talking about the moment that the weird old woman offs herself in a blatant last-ditch effort to give viewers something to talk about afterwards.  (Ooh!  What did she know?  It bottles the mind!  Yeah, you read that right - this film is NOT mind-boggling.  It is, in fact, mind-bottling.)  It comes a moment earlier when it is announced by cult leader #2 that no one before our heroine had even been able to talk about WHAT THEY SAW IN THE GREAT BEYOND.  So...cult leaders...then how exactly do you know that all of this torture can be justified by the effort to send people to the great beyond?  IF NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT?  The film would have made a lot more sense if the torture was being perpetrated by people who were simplyinsane.<br /><br />Sigh....<br /><br />At least there's Ti West.insane.<br /><br />Sigh....<br /><br />At least there's Ti West.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I am an elementary librarian.  This title kept coming up on suggested reading lists for me to read and purchase.  I have a K-6 school.  I am always looking for chapter books for my sixth graders to read.  So I purchased the book on Kindle.  Frankly I was disappointed.  The language and some of the content was definitely not appropriate for my students.  I wish I had known that it was basically a high school level book.  The story was okay.  I felt like it was too emotionally manipulative.  I did enjoy the way the title was brought into the story.  I did feel like the characters were true to life.  It just did not measure up to all the hype and high reviews I had read.  Of course what you read and enjoy is always personal and varies with every person.  I could have passed on this one.
B008133MDK|5.0|This series is great for numerous reasons.  The writing, the creative photography, the editing, but most of all the acting.  Unbelievable casting and an incredible re-imagining of the characters, together with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, make this season a great, great way to spend an afternoon.  Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best Game ever. super fun and hard to put down.  remember children Satan loves you. and this game is fun!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I first played this game on my sister's ipod and absolutely loved it. It's a nice change of pace from games like angry birds, a bit challenging, and lets you win or buy cool gadgets to make playing even more fun. I had a little trouble downloading the game to my android phone but other than that have had no problems. But I have had hours of enjoyment with this game!
B003N0XDT4|3.0|I'll say first that I have a Asus P8ZZ7-1 MITX mobo with Realtek ALC898, which is pretty recent, but the newest is ALC899.  Since it is a MITX motherboard, I can't use a PCI or PCIe sound card because there is no available slot for it, so my other option to improve the source sound is use a USB DAC.  From my last motherboard I noticed an improvment in sound coming from the ALC892 with the same headphones.  I was like, alright, lets keep going, lets see if I can get a better source.<br /><br />My most used headphones are Shure SRH440, Shure SRH940, and Audio Technica PRO700MK2.  I don't need an amp for any of these headphones because they get loud enough, while they do get slightly louder on the motherboard than when compared to my phone.  The motherboard can increase the volume of the headphones to unbearable levels already, so I don't care for the amp in the E7.<br /><br />I bought the E7 out of curiosity, and of course for the possiblity of improving my source sound.  I currently have 10 days (over 240 hours) on the Run Time counter on the Fiio E7 and I cannot tell a difference from my onboard.  My onboard (even my previous one) didn't have static or clicking sounds, so the E7 didn't improve a problem that was never there.  The E7 has a hiss that I can hear inbetween tracks or if there is a break in a song.  Not annoying enough for me to throw it against a wall, but it's there.<br /><br />I don't like or need the bass boost because I think my headphones do a good enough job already, especially the PRO700MK2.  I noticed with the SRH940, my most detailed headphone, that my music sounded worse as I increased the bass level.  With the SRH440 however, it sounded pretty good because that headphone is bright to begin with, so dulling the highs makes it more enjoyable.<br /><br />After analyzing a dozen pages of reviews on Amazon, I've come to the conlusion that all Apple products sound bad and Sennheiser headphones would benefit from the E7.  I own neither of those products.<br />However I will continuse to use this for a while longer and do some more comparisons with my onboard.  In a few months I'll do an update - if I still have it.  Maybe I'm just the kind of person who is easily satisfied with onboard sound combined with higher end headphones.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A Wanted Man is worth the price!  I gave it four stars because while being very good, it is not quite the book that \\"The Killing Floor\\" or \\"61 Hours\\" is.  In my opinion \\"61 Hours is the best Lee Child novel.  \\"A Wanted Man\\" is entertaining and left me wanting more. Reacher needs to make it to Virginia!  Maybe next time?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could give this book minus stars I would. I find it hard to believe this book was even seen by an editor. So many mistakes, misuse of language, langauge out of context, etc. it's unbelievable. Then to top it off you find out it's Twilight fanfic. Horrible. This book exemplifies what is wrong with the quick to publish world of today.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book . Already on the second book and I've started read less than a week ago . Some aspects are kinda weird with the red room , spanking and what not . Kinda seems so cheesy and unrealistic , but overall good trilogy so far
B007THA4FI|1.0|$17.99 for an electronic pulse? And people are paying that price? What's the old saying... a fool and his money are soon parted. Duh!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I had great luck with this and then it quit downloading movies. every one said &quot;check Internet connection&quot;  It works for Tv shows/short segment videos but no movies. followed advice and went to site redownloaded  and same crap. either fix it or get it off amazon. and no way am I taking a chance on the pay version. this was one of main reasons I got the kindle besides books. a huge disappointment for an amazon app.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This box set was really something special i am a very big fan of the walking dead and this is a great addition to my collection the product is built to last a long time and looks incredible in person!
1612680011|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is a great read and gives excellent advice. If I had been given it 40 years ago I would be much wealthier than I am now. I was so impressed I had a copy sent to my grandson and to the daughter of a friend of mine.<br />Seems they are both interested in having a good life.
B008XG1X18|2.0|the app is constantly unresponsive and I have to force close on my kindle fire... I love pinterest but this is so annoying!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|not my usual game style but it was fun and thebgraphics are great. there were some objects that would have been impossible to find without using the hint
B008XG1X18|5.0|so happy pinterest app finally became available for android. haven't had any problems since downloading and better than accessing via browser.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app makes working easy!!  Very easy to use and very convenient.  I use it all the time for bills and helping the kids with homework.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great simple easy to use, big and easy to read. never had a problem with it recommend it to anyone.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The package came very quickly and was very pleased with it's condition. Overall I think I lucked out because the initial release date price for this item on Amazon was $20, and now it's going for $35.99 (today at 9/30/2012). I heard Amazon priced it down to $20 because they caught on that Target was also selling it for $20 at their stores for the exact same copy.<br /><br />The movie is terrific so I won't even get into details about that, and I'm sure a lot of people already read rave reviews about the movie, which it definitely deserves. I saw the 3D version on the tv and it was awesome. The clarity and the depth of field is beyond beautiful.<br /><br />The product is terrific. I instantly downloaded the music inspired by the movie, got the digital copy immediately to my iPad, and abused all the extras in the movie-the gag reals, deleted scenes, etc etc. There's also a digital comic and a free poster offer in the copy.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I love facebook. I love how I am able to keep in \\"contact\\" with friends and family without the awkward pauses, on the phone. I like being able to \\"catch up\\" without actually having to see them face to face..<br /><br />However, their \\"app\\" such as: iPhone, iPad, and this one, for my Kindle Fire HD, for lack of better words, sucks. I want to be able to have more control on what I do. I want to create albums. I want to be able to see my \\"other\\" folder, which is always a \\"secret\\" for some reason on the PC. Why can't I see the folder on my devices? Whats so top secret about this folder? WHY HIDE it?<br /><br />I also hate how its so slow (its just not my Fire HD's device either). Pretty much the app, as a whole, sucks.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|We love Battleship the game and the movie was right on target(pun intended). Very light, fun Science Fiction meets boardgame although beginning is a bit of a throwback combination of An Officer and Gentleman and Top Gun but in good stride not nauseating. Loved it for the light fun it is.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a must read. The characters are captivating and keep you wondering what will happen next. For those whom would say that these book are house wife porn are not educated enough to pick up the books and read what the plot is really about. If your looking for something to read and keep your attention this is a great book
B004UID2LC|1.0|ok so when I first got it it worked great but now it wont download anything its terrible if you don't listen idk
B007THA4FI|1.0|OK I realize this is a new release, but that does not excuse ripping off the customer for eBook version.  Maybe if the publishers were not so heavily invested into the printing press companies (Many own their presses and they are losing money big time) we would not have to pay for your losses.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm a total math geek, and I'm always trying to show people how great math is. I usually do math in my head, but sometimes you need a little help (38*$16.79?). This is my go-to app. I have it on my Kindle and my Android phone. I HAVE to have a calculator!
B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this for my daughter almost a year ago and it is still in great shape.  Good value for the money.
B008XG1X18|3.0|it &quot;hangs&quot; about 50 percent of the time, having to force close. the website version isn't much better but you'd think by now they'd have worked out some of these stupid bugs.
B0082A3JHQ|5.0|Drove to work with Jimi playing just for me!  Wow! What a Trip!<br />Brilliant concert, which shows the early stages in the evolution and development of a lot of his later songs! Simply Brilliant!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|The two bonus tracks DRIVE BY LOVER and THRESHOLD TO A HEARTACHE are only available at BEST BUY. Two of the best songs. otherwise, a great release by one of my all time favorites. Love every song.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This movie was an eye-opening, learning, heart-widening experience.  You'll fall in love with the characters; how they change/what their lives become.  You'll find certain parts of this movie disturbing and funny and it will reach such a critical point in your system, you'll feel joy and unpleasant emotion combined into something heart felt and real.  If you've got Japanese heritage like me, you'll really feel happy watching this movie.  Ride along with the story listening to cello music that will soothe your soul.  You'll feel part of this family, close to the story, involved, deeply connected.  I felt good to be alive after the movie ended.
B008XG1X18|4.0|sometimes this app fails when I open it. but if I try once, and it fail, I just force it to close and reopen it and then it works perfectly. I love this app and am slightly addicted to it. just be patient with it and you'll get used to having to open it a few times.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a great page turner.<br /><br />In honesty, at first I wasn't sure if I'd like it. I didn't like the first book that much - just couldn't care about the characters. With this book, I felt like the characters were more developed and interesting - less canned. With the exception of the beginning of the book, which was just predictable and seemed exaggerated, this book was a great read.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I love angry birds bit since my credit card &quot;isn supported by a county&quot; i get any games even if there free so i cant get any games at all because i live in Bermuda (for all you people who dont know where the heack Bermuda is get a map)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i have enjoyed this game very much. fun for everyone. trying to keep my kids from hogging my kindle is the hardest part about this game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|hey I had this game for about a month &ntilde;ow so I would really like you to buy it so eat do you think now
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I was nicely surprised by this movie. It was humorous and well-acted. Steve Carell is Gru, the \\"evil villain\\" who has a plan to steal the moon. John Segel is Vector, Gru's arch enemy, who steals the shrinking machine that Gru was going to use in his plan. Gru decides to become the guardian of three orphaned girls that he hopes will be able to help him get his shrinking machine back. In the process, he finds himself spending time with the girls and falling in love with them.<br /><br />The movie pack arrived as scheduled and in proper working order.
B008KGPEQG|4.0|A highly personal and evocative memoir that will appeal greatly to fans of the author. Even for those who do not know Auster well, the writing on aging, parents and marriage is beautiful. Even from within a somewhat tedious recounting of all of the author's places of residence, stories that are engaging and funny emerge.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works great. Love the ability to see the forecasts so easily. Recommended download. Best weather app out there.  Radar works good too.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great app that helps to inspire people. I have spent hours upon hours searching for things for my little ones first birthday party, and home decoration ideas as well as fitness routines.  Everything is on here. My biggest problem is how many times it froze up or made me force close on my kindle fire.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|Nifty little puzzler. Works great on my Inspire. Minimal permissions. Developer that responds to comments. What's not to like? But, not really something to keep me 'glued' for hours, so, only 4 stars.
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|Great movie great story<br />Madonna achieved another talent with this one. Hope she comes up with more movies.<br />Thumbs up!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the variety of sounds available and the way I can choose several different sounds together to make the perfect blend. It's the greatest thing for relaxing the mind after a stressful day. I have found it simply wonderful!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|coin dozer is a great game. It is fun to play. I play it a lot. You should buy it.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|My friend was over at my house last week, and he realized that Rayman Jungle Run came out that very day, a couple hours before he noticed. Out of curiosity, I told him to download it onto his phone. Out of his own curiosity (and my demand, I guess), he downloaded it. And then as he began to play it, I was blown away instantly (And I constantly begged for turns before I actually did get to play it). I loved [[ASIN:B0050SVFB0 Rayman Origins]], and I was really looking forward to at least playing [[ASIN:B00BYDKCZK Rayman Legends]], too. However, this game single-handedly allowed me to (be able to) wait.<br /><br />So what IS Rayman Jungle Run? [[ASIN:B00002971H A]] [[ASIN:B00004UDVU port]] [[ASIN:B00069ZIO8 of]] [[ASIN:B004L4AZ7Y Rayman 2]]? Nope! Rayman Jungle Run is a one-button platformer (With Rayman automatically running) utilizing gameplay from Rayman Origins! You'd think this probably wouldn't work out so well, but believe me: It was incredible. The levels are divided into 4 categories: Jump, Fly, Wall Run & Punch. And they are all based on a new mechanic (As you can tell) that is introduced for each one. All this by simply tapping the screen? Yup. Ubisoft and Pastagames are companies full of geniuses, as this game works flawlessly.<br /><br />On top of the remarkable gameplay is the fact that the game looks downright beautiful. The new environments in this game look as terrifically colorful and whimsical as the environments in Rayman Origins were. The music is also really fun to listen to.<br /><br />Could this possibly be the best $2.99 ever spent? Perhaps so. Rayman Origins is one of the best games I've ever played, while Jungle Run is one of the best apps I've ever played. The first thing I'm gonna do whenever I get my own iPhone (I have a Java-based phone) is get this game, so I won't have to ask for my friend's iPhone every time I wanna play this masterpiece.<br /><br />UPDATE: Got my iPhone, and still loving the heck out of this game. :-)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I used to love this game when I was a little girl. I was so glad when I found it on here as a free app game.I will play everyday...It is a very addictive game.
B0063GORYU|1.0|This game is possessed.  It makes the decisions on where it wants the cards no matter how hard you fight with it.  Extremely irritating!
B004UID2LC|2.0|it was ok ... Unitil it broke. now it just says (cannot play this file please ckeck current connection quality
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Only wish checkboxes could be added in the android version. I use evernote for practically everything, and the kindle version is very well laid out, in my opinion.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This was a great game. The puzzles were challenging and fun. It kept my interest the whole time. Try it you will like it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and it made me want to read the third book in the series.  I have now started reading it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|You can count the number of authors who successfully made the jump from children's fiction to adult fiction on one hand. The differences between the two are too vast and too hard to master. You can add J.K. Rowling to the ranks of authors who tried and failed. Her writing style is a perfect fit for children's fantasy, but does not work here. She tries too hard to make the jump and as a result has written a book that will soon be forgotten. I read this week that Rowling might write another Harry Potter book. I hope that is the direction she chooses, because adult fiction just isn't her cup of tea.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|A rather disapointing read. A large part of the story is taken up with driving to and fro. Place descriptions are long and often repeated. I got the impression that the latter was employed to bulk up the text. The plot was in my view also a bit thin and did not convey the action and excitement one would expect from a Reacher novel. This will however not deter me from buying and reading the next Reacher novel in which he will have hopefully reached Virginia.
1467934925|3.0|This edition of the book contains serious typesetting problems that basically ruin the equations, and with them most of the value of having this text in the first place. I would suggest another printing, since so many publishing houses reprint this book cheaply.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]I am a big fan of this series but I guess I was expecting more. Maybe if this is the only book you would read of the series it would be ok. Once I read the first book in the Spring of this year I read all of the books in order. I think Lee Child is now at the point of sleep walking through now as he writes. Nothing was new and the formula is the same as in all the books much like James Bond books are. However, this one didn't develop the characters as much. Maybe other readers will be happy to read the same formula time and again but I probably won't spend anymore money on the Kindle price but may buy a used paperback. I would be interested if others who have read the series feel like I do. Definitely think Tom Cruise is not the right actor mainly because of his height. Probably a coup to get him on board for box office appeal though.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I saw this Concert on PBS and enjoyed it so much I wanted the CD. I don't think I'd ever heard his music before this time and was amazed by his music and his performance. I loved it and listen to it in the car all the time. I definitely would recommend this CD to any music lover.
0345803485|3.0|Yes this book isn't the best written and yes she uses repetitive language but my \\"oh my\\" in the title refers to the bad reviewers! Everyone seems so angry about this book! It's a book and you are given the choice to read it. And what I find most amusing is that a great deal of people that gave this one a bad review went on to read the other 2 and gave those books a bad review as well!! Why did you even bother? It does say something about the book's subject matter though....<br /><br />That being said I am on the fence with this book...halfway through and it is holding my interest for WHAT IT IS. I am not expecting a genius literary work from a book that is about S&M and neither should anyone else. I am not hating it or loving it but the fact that I am sticking with it says something because I have not finished books many times.<br /><br />For those of you considering this book please don't be swayed by the countless angry bad reviews. Go into reading this book thinking its not going to be a classic but just some fun reading.
B007N8RULO|3.0|No pause or stop buttons to allow for breaks and the ads are annoying but it is still a fun game.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this is an awesome game that is great for kids. its quiet addicting though so be careful. great and awesome game
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I got these headphones because the price was right. Cheap. And they are great headphones. Resonating bass and crisp highs. They are very revealing though. You play shitty audio through these and it's barely listenable. You hear exactly what you have, so if you've got high quality recordings, you're gold. The headphones are light, but they're not at all flimsy. There is an awefull lot of sound bleed, though, especially at high volumes. People next to you will hear your music. Overall for the money, you're not gonna find much anything better.
0525953728|3.0|I bought this book in order to bypass political posturing and understand what took place at UBL's compound.  The author delivered on that promise.  The problem Mr. Owen faced, however, is that the description of those events only required about 40 pages and the book is 299 pages, the rest of which are filled with war stories one can hear on any Saturday afternoon in a VFW bar.  Still, a pretty good investment.
0984183523|5.0|This book is a great consolidation of critical concepts needed for a case interview. The importance of hypothesis and way to structure is really helpful and builds the foundation for the rest of the case. Overall excellent concise resource!
B0086700CM|5.0|Husband started playing on his Ipod so I decided to try it. I like it better on the Kindle fire (bigger screen) but its a pretty addictive game. Nice way to pass time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I only got this because it was free. I absolutely love it. it is very addictive. way more fun than the real game
B005LAII8A|4.0|This was a very interesting movie--very futuristic and certainly very creative. I give it 3.5 stars, rounded to 4.  It also was very violent and bloody.  If you are super-sensitive to violence, you probably do NOT want to see it.  If you are still with me. . .<br /><br />The story begins in Kansas, USA, in the past year of 2044 and is tied to the future year of 2074.  Time travel is illegal, but a criminal organization uses it, along with specialized assassins, to eliminate folks.  If you send someone from 2074 back to 2044 and shoot them, then they never existed (at least most of the time).  (Granted, there are a few flaws with that line of thinking.)<br /><br />So, our hero (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is in 2044.  In 2074, people are grabbed, tied, bag over their head, transported to 2044 with payment on their back, and shot by our hero.  The folks who are sent back to be killed are called \\"loops\\".  Our hero is one of several assassins. 2044 is futuristic (and doesn't exactly make you want to still be alive) with lots of people levitating quarters in the air to try to prove they are telekinetic, or have \\"TK\\".  Lots of drugs around.  You squirt them in your eyes and spin off into lala land.  The friend of our hero lets a loop run loose, and is now on the run and terrified of the new crime boss in 2074 \\"Rainman\\" (as in reign of terror).  The rumor is that Rainman wants all the loops closed and the loopers killed. (Bruce Willis plays our hero from 2074.)<br /><br />Interesting movie--different--but lots of killing, lots of blood and violence.  I will not watch it again, but those with stronger stomachs will probably enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i like that you have to get money to buy the other get. also there's  alot of games you can play.
0316228532|1.0|What a huge disappointment coming from one of the best story tellers of her generation. I knew going into the book to put Harry Potter up on the shelf; this was NOT a wizarding experience. But what I wasn't expecting was boredom and run-of-the-mill story telling. Unfortunately this book is just like every other who dunnit out there! Ms. Rowlings, you have a unique talent for creating fantasy. Go back to your roots - I'm sure there's another Harry Potter in you somewhere!

B0098VXE50|3.0|Movie had little plot. Other then special effects its a snooze, we kept waiting for it to get better. I think the main problem was they tried to make it so dark and not enchanting enough. Not a fan of Kristen Stewart
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I'm wondering why everyone needs 25 paragraphs to write a simple review of a film.  I went to see the movie and paid full price ($10) 5 times.  Renner creates vulnerability and protectiveness in the movie that many (in my town anyway) seem to find appealing.  The movie has been out for some time now but I still go to see it and half the theater is still filled.  Norton & Keach were great picks for their characters, Norton's acting ability speaks for itself, (American History X and Primal Fear).  Renner is a shy, likeable, naive  person on talk shows but a little bit awkward.  Nevertheless his acting is first rate and the film is very difficult not to like a great deal.  See Renner in \\"The Town\\" also (Ben Affleck's movie)he was very convincing.  Never saw him kiss a girl in any film yet.  Good movie, see it if you haven't yet.
B001P3SA94|5.0|It was a great movie...fast delivery & good price. If you are looking for a movie about some great singers & great music, this is one of the top ones.
B000002AGN|5.0|I bought the CD because of 'Take Five', which I'm learning to play on the piano.  I am thrilled that all the songs on this CD are outstanding!  Many of these songs are familiar to me, a child of the 50's.  The CD insert discusses the music, styles, tempos, etc and was really a bonus.  Particularly since I'm an amateur musician.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album/CD.<br /><br />PJ
B0001Z52RU|5.0|you don't want to miss this movie, it is one that you have to watch or you will miss something and it shows you how we our actions affect other people lives.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I absolutely love this app. If any problems should occur all you have to do is notify customer service. Please keep in mind people that this is man made so of course it will have kinks from time to time. Nothing is 100% but this app is dang near close. I adore it and hopefully this can help anyone who has any questions about it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Fun game that lets you play without ads for free. All of the challenges are fun and challenging. Easy game to play as well.
0316228532|4.0|One newspaper review I read before getting the book suggested that all of the characters are like the Dursleys in Harry Potter - mean, small-minded and selfish.  There are certainly some like that in this book, and Rowling uses them to paint a portrait of small town life in England that is alternately funny and appalling.  There's the self-satisfied and self-important parish council chairman whose chief goal in life is to cut off from his village a local housing project and de-fund the social services that help its struggling residents.  There's the middle-aged woman, trapped in a loveless, boring marriage, who secretly obsesses over a member of a boy band she sees in her daughter's DVD collection.  There's the middle manager at a printing company who terrorizes his wife and kids as though they were inmates in a concentration camp of which he is the commandant.  But there are also several characters who are well-meaning and want to do good works that don't benefit them personally - except in terms of validating their self-image.<br /><br />None of the characters in the book are people you'd want as friends or neighbors.  Rowling serves up delicious descriptions of their inner lives and their interactions that are a treat for connoisseurs of dark humor, however.  If you like that, you'll like this book.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Resident Evil series are one of the best I've watched.  I didn't think it was possible to make sequals that each movie is just as good as the previous ones congratulations \\"YOU'VE DONE IT\\"
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the few android games that didn't end up being uninstalled shortly after downloading. If that isn't enough praise in itself, then perhaps the fact that it is not only relaxing (with very zen music in the background to boot), but challenging enough of a puzzle game to keep things interesting will suffice.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the only two android games I've felt are actually worth paying for (the other being Cut the Rope). It'll definitely keep you happy longer than whatever else you find for just a buck. Heck, I'd even say it might be worth more than they're asking, and I'm a pretty frugal guy.
0525953728|5.0|This book is eye opening in so many ways.  We tend to forget the great sacrifice a few brave men and women make to provide us with the freedoms we enjoy each and every day in the United States of America.<br />God bless them one and all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very challenging game for your spare time.  it keeps your mind active.  try to see how many wins you can get in a row.

B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Please Lee could you try to write a little faster? A Wanted Man is another brilliant Jack Reacher story. Fast moving - fun to read and always brilliant.
B0058SNJG6|5.0|I bought these shoes on a whim, desperate to try any type of flat that I could work in for 10 hours without dealing with extreme discomfort at the end of the day. These were the answer to my search. As a Hair Stylist, I'm on my feet ALL day and to end my day without feet/leg pain is rare. I've worn these shoes every day since they arrived and they're the best shoes I've ever worked in. I highly recommend these to people who want a comfortable and versatile shoe. You can wear them with work clothes or casual outfits and turn right around and do yard or garden work as well. Easy to clean with good support for individuals with a medium arch. The best money I've ever spent! :)

B004YM6JK0|3.0|What has happened to my favorite show?  I understand that they need to evolve and make changes, but they don't need to keep killing main characters.  And now the Impala is gone too. I am kinda mad, but going to hold out for next season since I love the show so much.  I do like the new villain the leviathans, but the formula that made past seasons so great seemed missing.  There was very little funny mixed in with the drama, and I think tat upset me the most.  You could usually count on at least 2 funny episodes in each season to balance out the dark drama.  This season is was mostly Dean drinking a lot while depressed, and Sam adopting a sunny outlook because as he said, it can't get any worse.  And worst of all, they brought back evil clowns.  WHY!  Here's hoping S8 makes up for the last 2 seasons
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's great to see an insider's account not only of the raid, but on how DEVGRU prepares.  Catching up to Bin Laden was almost anti-climactic in that it was just another raid that had been perfected over time.  This book made me gain an even greater appreciation for what our servicemen sacrifice for our freedom and security.

And, were I an older man, I surely would ... ... but I'm a man of thirty - of twenty again. The rain on my chest is a baptism - I'm born again ... \\"<br /><br />I was DYING to see/hear that scene in the animated movie adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns. It wasn't in it. I guess they decided to leave it out. Mildly disappointing, but I got over it. There were other minor changes/omissions. On the race track, when Bruce Wayne crashed, he narrated, \\"this would be a good death...but not good enough.\\" That wasn't in the movie. When the pimp gave the cab driver a roll of cash to keep the cab still while he beat his prostitute. Batman landed on the cab and handed the cabdriver a roll of cash to keep the cab still while he beat the pimp. That wasn't in the movie. There seemed to be a somewhat clumsy flow from one scene to the next. This was probably due to time constraints. These aren't necessarily complaints; just observations. Overall, the movie was well done. I watched it three times so far so that should tell you something. Allow for the fact that there are changes from the novel and its incredibly enjoyable! I await part two.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. One of the true classics of Science Fiction. I've found that a lot of sci-fi is very dense and almost tedious. Card doesn't do this as much, the story tends to flow and roll along very smoothly.
0307592731|1.0|If you're looking for a literary masterpiece, this isn't it. It is undistinguished, run-of-the-mill, pedestrian. Written at a high school level with crude teenaged vernacular to match, it's not exactly the inspiring read you'd want to take with you if you were going on a very long hike. (Burn this one *before* you go, and don't let your children near it. Poor Carver and Bobbi when they read it.)<br /><br />\\"Wild\\" is a memoir penned by an immature and promiscuous woman. It's a revealing psychological journey into the blindness and denial that accompanies self-destruction. We travel to another dimension, a Twilight Zone of self-centeredness, and there witness a person whose emotional moorings are missing and whose mind is out of whack.<br /><br />Cheryl grew up relatively poor with uneducated parents in a ramshackle cabin amid the Minnesota backwoods. They had no electricity or running water. At a young age, she and her two siblings were abandoned by their physically abusive biological father and neglected by their mother when left alone for long stretches of time, being told by Mommy there were other mothers around to care for them. Imagine that for a minute. It's unthinkable, really, leaving already emotionally wounded children alone. Her mother smoked pot in front of them, making excuses for it, and she kept her distance from others. Her death at 44 is incredibly tragic and left an indelible mark on Cheryl, no doubt. But her reaction to it goes beyond the normal grieving process. Eating the bones of your cremated mother is abnormal behavior, folks. It makes you wonder: Does this woman ever think before she acts?<br /><br />Those who aren't properly parented are at a higher risk for emotional problems. Cheryl seems bright but her intelligence is hijacked by an amazing degree of impulsiveness and escapist thought patterns typical of heroin users. For example, she pops chewable opium into her mouth at the mere suggestion of an unknown loner, then afterward considers what she's done. She's clearly without a moral compass or decision-making skills.<br /><br />This leads to a series of utterly foolish decisions and dangerous self-destructive behavior, the book's main focus being one of them - hiking the PCT woefully unprepared. The parts of the trail she did complete (she covered less than half of its 2,663 miles) were made possible by the generous help she received from others along the way, such as Albert who lightened her pack and Greg who gave her a crash course on how to use an ice ax, but she doesn't acknowledge this. There's no sense of gratitude for those who saved her ass, only tawdry talk about those who freely got a piece of it.<br /><br />They shoot horses, don't they? No, they don't, not in the 1990s. The family should have pooled their money together in order to put Lady down humanely. Why didn't they? Instead the horse was shot repeatedly, suffering horribly before death. Another thing done on the cheap without thinking.<br /><br />But that's just it. This narrative is a homage to self: Cheryl's immediate wants and needs that were impulsively and selfishly met. How to satisfy yourself on a shoestring without a carefully thought-out plan. \\"If it feels good, do it\\" was her motto, although that didn't end well for Paul, her devoted husband, a terrific guy she tossed aside so she could get her ya-ya's out.<br /><br />On the one hand, you want to say it's no wonder she led a feckless life with such a background. Shouldn't she be excused for her adulterous, irresponsible behavior? On the other hand, most of what she describes didn't have to happen. Almost every negative experience she relates in painstaking and oftentimes repulsive detail (with the exception of her mother's death, minus the male nurse she imagined whoring with) was self-inflicted and the consequence of a wrong choice, an ill-conceived decision rooted in rebellion.<br /><br />In other words, she didn't have to slide into life-threatening drug abuse and engage in indiscriminate sex with losers. She had choices, even in her raging anger and palpable grief. A woman who'd bed a man she doesn't know simply because he's good-looking and likes the same music she does isn't doing so because she's mourning the loss of a loved one. Rather she's driven by sexual lust she has no desire or self-respect to control. To attribute her loose morals to anything else is missing the mark big-time. You don't have to read between the lines for the reason either. She tells us why: \\"There hasn't ever been a time that I've done that [feeling a gorgeous male body with her hands] that I haven't remembered all over again how much I love men.\\" So her mother's death, albeit crushing, had nothing to do with it. She was hot to trot and proud of it.<br /><br />Another thought...why would someone who fancies herself a free-thinking feminist contemplate sexual intercourse with a man who fails to supply his own condoms?<br /><br />At the end of the memoir, there is no evidence supplied that suggests a change has occurred in Cheryl, as the title attests. In what way did she change? What was her profound discovery? We don't know because she doesn't tell us. Readers are left to conclude her deep void, lack of self-respect, and capacity for making asinine mistakes remain. Indeed, the writing of this memoir itself is proof. What was she thinking? Once again, she wasn't. What woman, in her right mind, who genuinely loves her children, would publicize for the entire world - with immense pride! - her humiliating, salacious, Russian roulette behavior?<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed should be crowned the Drama Queen of the PCT. Not the only girl in the woods in 1995, true royalty belongs to the four women who actually completed the entire Pacific Crest Trail that year: Laurie Dressler, Kathy Faulks, Debbie Higgins and Laura Seltzer. Did they carry Trojans and pre-pack lingerie to be ready for a quickie with a total stranger at the drop of their pants? Cheryl prepared for what meant the most to her, what was in the forefront of her mind, and it wasn't her feet.<br /><br />And think about something else...if a man had authored this, would Oprah have picked it? No way, not in a million little years. She'd be lambasted for recommending a book written by a man who cheated on and then divorced his wife and used women for sexual pleasure without a second thought.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book. It has no philosophical insight or spiritual value. I wasted my time but not my money by borrowing the Kindle version from our local library.ge in indiscriminate sex with losers.

B005LAJ1H2|3.0|Loved the 1st season, and most of this season too. Unfortunately the last 3 or 4 episodes wreck it. The plot makes no sense and doesnt know<br />where its going. I had assumed they had great storywriters who had planned the whole thing in advance, but alas it seems like they're making<br />it up as they go, episode by episode. One minute Nucky's in Power, next minute the young Darmody is the Big Boss, yet inexplicably continues<br />to run around like a hooligan shooting people, cutting throats etc. As the Boss surely he would have his goons do this for him? Finally Nucky<br />escapes jail and a murder conviction by the skin of his teeth only to immediately commit another murder, this time personally, of the young<br />Darmody. Just makes no sense at all.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|For a first time author the book is excellent. It gives the real account of killing UBL, better known as Osama Bin Laden. A vivid description of the training and preparation on the raid of Abbotsbad, Pakistan. This includes other Seal missions of the author the journey there, what happened in details and the journey back to Virginia Beach when all was said and done.<br /><br />I could relate to the book perfectly being a former Airborne Ranger and Vietnam Combat Veteran. I went on 46 death missions in Vietnam, so it brought back many memories and nightmares of war. Military personnel and veterans should love it. People w/o military service may enjoy it and yet, not understand it completely.<br /><br />Seal team 5 are good and risked their lives to take out a notorious war criminal responsible for thousands of lives.<br /><br />Not long and easy to read. I recommend it and if you buy it the funds go to a very worthy cause for SEAL veterans and families.
1849025940|4.0|This quite uplifting for Orwell.  The book is series of  tales of a time he was a dishwasher in Paris restaurants and  a tramp in London.<br /><br />I am presuming he endured this as some sort of social experiment rather than of necessity, which appears proven as he always has someone to give him the cash to survive or travel.<br /><br />We are introduced to the filth and appalling conditions endured by many, some through choice, some through life just being harsh.<br /><br />How the book was uplifting for me was that many having no other choice just got on with it and did quite amazing things to survive.  What was really apparent is that just because there was poverty there was no automatic drift into crime - which seems to contradict much of what today's social engineers would have us believe.<br /><br />A interesting read from the early 20th century.  (1933)
B007OV9EYG|3.0|\\"The Lorax\\" was an okay movie. It is a great movie for kids but I would not recommend this movie for adults. If you plan to buy it to give or show to grandchildren - great, otherwise I would recommend passing on this movie.<br /><br />As always, Amazon performed amazingly. I enjoy the buying experience from Amazon and if you have never purchased on-line before, I highly recommend trying Amazon as I know you will be very pleased with the experience.
0316228532|5.0|Another classic from J.K. Rowling.  I haven't been so consumed by a novel since The Help.  It's a sharp take on modern English village life and the need for compassion. Expect a lot of discussion of OCD in the coming months as more people read the book. It's not just about washing hands I learned, and JK says she suffered from it when<br />she was younger. There's also a methadone clinic that plays a central role and a sobering look at a physically abusive father.  I have to confess that I savoured every scene featuring the outsized first citizen of Pagford, Howard Mollison.  He's one of the funniest pompous characters since Ignatius in A Confederacy of Dunces.  The teenage characters are wonderfully drawn, especially in the way they communicate to each other.  Krystal of the Fields is the female Harry Potter without the magic powers.  She strives as hard as Harry, and takes to crew like he does to Quidditch.  She doesn't need an invisibility cloak to be invisible however.  Poverty takes care of that.  Readers will never be able to erase her from their minds or hearts.  I'm giving my copy to my nephew this afternoon. I read the first Harry Potter book aloud to him in 1998. Time passes. I'm sure he'll handle this adult fare just fine and be the better for having absorbed its powerful message of sympathy.  Butterbeer makes life sweet, but a novel like this changes you.

B005LAIHR2|3.0|Directed by Adam Shankman of \\"Hairspray\\" fame, \\"Rock of Ages\\" is a cinematic version of a Broadway musical of the same title. The film is a tribute to the '80s rock scene, the time of great Twisted Sister, but somehow lacks the power and energy of the same director's previous musical adaptation and its charming heroine Tracy.<br /><br />Set in 1987, \\"Rock of Ages\\" starts with Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough), a girl from Oklahoma with a dream of becoming a singer. In LA she meets Drew Boley (Diego Boneta), an aspiring rock singer and song writer, working at a Hollywood club \\"The Bourbon Room,\\" owned by Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin). The young couple is both likable, and their songs are not bad, but the story is thin, and their characters are bland and hardly fleshed out.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays a washed-out rocker Stacee Jaxx. I was not impressed with the vamped-up version of a stereotypical rock star image itself, but Tom Cruise does it with an energy and zeal that is infectious. He steals not only scenes, but the entire film, relegating the romance and success story of the main characters to an unmemorable subplot. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand as the club's manager are also very good, generating some laughs with a few comical dialogues.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti plays his sleazy manager Paul Gill. Malin Åkerman is an outspoken Rolling Stone reporter Constance Sack, a \\"love interest\\" of the legendary rock star. Catherine Zeta-Jones is overzealous Patricia Whitmore protesting against the rock (reference to the 1985 Senatorial hearings). They all turn in deliberately over-the-top performances that are apt for the film's setting, but not good enough to make the film a memorable one.<br /><br />After all, we - or most of the target audience - still remember the passion and energy of the 80s rock, and the overlong and unfocused film simply does not have it. This is like listening to someone's cover songs when there is the original which is better.

B0087JTAKW|3.0|This book is more worthy of 3 1/2 stars, but I rounded down, for some reasons that I'll explain.<br /><br />This is my first Mitch Albom book and I had heard a lot about it when I went to his site to get information about The Five People You Meet in Heaven. I read the blurb for this book and it sounded interesting. Good thing that it's also a pretty short book, fewer than 230 pages in hardcover.<br /><br />I thought it was well written and thought some of the lines were genius. I also liked that it wasn't bogged down with description, information and backstory. I loved the flow of some of the dialogue where it was sparse and without action beats or he said/she said.<br /><br />Some parts I thought would have been better if it were shown instead of told. I liked the narration. The book kept my attention by keeping me guessing with what was going to happen next, so even during times when it seemed slow and boring, there was something that made me keep picking up the book and turning pages. I also liked that the chapters were pretty short because it gave me a sense of making progress through a book that I really wanted to hurry up and finish so I can crack open the next book.<br /><br />In a way the narration was pretty distant, but I liked it and I think it worked for the actual prose, which I liked, but not for the characters. I couldn't identify with the characters. I couldn't relate to Dor, so had no feeling for what happened to him in the end. I couldn't relate to the main female character and thought she was under-developed. For instance, something happens between her and a boy that sends her emotions spinning out of control. I can completely understand someone in her situation breaking down the way she did, but I couldn't see this character breaking down in that manner; it seemed out of character for her, and, like Dor, I didn't feel any emotion for her or her situation. I kind of understood Victor a bit more, but I also thought he could have been more developed. We're told throughout the story that he's super rich and can buy anything he wants but I think that would have better off shown to the reader than told to us.<br /><br />I think the author lacked a lot of development with the 3 main characters and the book is so short that Albom definitely had enough room to really explore who they were because I don't think he did it effectively in this book.<br /><br />There were two things that really bothered me about the book that made me round down the 3 1/3 stars to 3 instead of rounding up to 4. I didn't like that it was obviously trying to teach me a lesson and I didn't like the blatant religious overtones. I prefer to read books without preaching and without the author thrusting religion in my face.<br /><br />Overall, the book was just okay. I like Albom's sparse prose and a lot of other things about his writing style. The 5 People You Meet in Heaven is still on my to-read list and I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to know if they should read it.
B0089BSM70|4.0|Shout! Factory's horror division, which they've christened Scream! Factory, continues to release quality Blu-ray versions of cult classics most uneducated viewers write off as B-movie schlock. One of those 1980s gems they've treated like cinema royalty is \\"Halloween II.\\" Many look at this sequel as the unwanted imitator of the original that upped the gore ante and added cheap jump moments where genuine ones of suspense once were. However, there's a legion of fans out there of the franchise that carry a treaty loyalty to the film and its cast and creators. The new \\"Halloween II: Collector's Edition\\" was put together for those individuals.<br /><br />\\"Halloween II\\" begins exactly at the end of the original film. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) runs downstairs into the front yard of the house he found Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in. He discovers that Myers has walked off from the spot where he landed after Loomis shot him several times knocking him off the 2nd story balcony. Laurie is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she's admitted for treatment. Michael tracks her down to the hospital and begins killing the medical personnel one by one in his search for Laurie. Can Dr. Loomis track him down and end his reign of terror before Myers can get to his sister?<br /><br />Is \\"Halloween II\\" as good as or better than its predecessor? Of course not. Is it good in its own right as an entertaining slasher film? I believe it is. Director Rick Rosenthal did what any man picking up the reigns from a master like John Carpenter would. First, he uses the same director of photography to capture the movie visually. Next, Rosenthal tries to hang on to the suspense that made the first movie a hit, but at the same time add more moments of gore to elevate it to a different level. Did it work all the time? No, it didn't.<br /><br />However, it did add all sorts of iconic moments that viewers still hang on to and celebrate to this day. Moments like the blood running down Myers' mask after Laurie shoots him in the eyes; the swishing of the scalpel as he blindly swings it in front of him trying to kill whoever gets in his way; the POV shots of the killer stalking while we hear his heavy breathing under the mask; and who can forget the scene where the mother is taking her little boy to the emergency room after he bit into an apple with a razor in it? That put Halloween in a bad light from the moment it first debuted in front of an audience.<br /><br />It's great to see a cast give such genuine performances in what many actors might write off as an opportunity to just pick up an easy paycheck. Jamie Lee Curtis returns in the role of Laurie Strode and isn't given a lot of dialogue to work with but does her best to deliver legitimate bursts of fear and anxiety as she crawls and stumbles around the hospital hiding from Michael Myers. Lance Guest (\\"The Last Starfighter\\") plays paramedic Jimmy who is convincingly intent on keeping Laurie safe from Myers' clutches. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis and continues to add a level of class and drama to the film that many slasher movies of the decade sorely lacked.<br /><br />The high-definition transfer of \\"Halloween II\\" delivers the movie to fans in a whole new light that I'm sure it's never been seen in. The picture is as clean and vibrant as its ever been. The 5.1 audio guarantees that John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's eerie electronic score mixed with the screams, gunshots, knife swishing, and heavy-breathing terrifyingly envelopes you.<br /><br />Shout! Factory scores big points with horror aficionados when it comes to the special features for \\"Halloween II: Collector's Edition.\\" It's literally packed full of treats and goodies. They include the theatrical version and television cut with extra footage not seen in theaters. Two audio commentaries feature director Rick Rosenthal, actor Leo Rossi and actor / stunt coordinator Dick Warlock talking about the film. Two exciting featurettes give fans more insight into the making of the movie. \\"The Nightmare Isn't Over!: The Making of 'Halloween II'\\" goes behind the scenes and explores the history of the film. \\"Horror's Hallowed Grounds: The Locations of 'Halloween II'\\" takes the viewer on a tour of where the movie was filmed. There are also deleted scenes and an alternate ending with commentary for both by Rick Rosenthal. A theatrical trailer, TV and radio spots, and a still gallery are found as well.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of \\"Halloween II: Collector's Edition\\" is a great gift for any fan of the popular franchise. If it was affordable to buy enough of these to drop into the buckets of trick or treaters on All Hallows Eve, you'd be the toast of your neighborhood. I honestly don't know what more they could add to this to improve on it. It's the definitive version of the movie all Michael Myers enthusiasts must get their hands on.wo exciting featurettes give fans more insight into the making of the movie. \\"The Nightmare Isn't Over!: The Making of 'Halloween II'\\" goes behind the scenes and explores the history of the film. \\"Horror's Hallowed Grounds: The Locations of 'Halloween II'\\" takes the viewer on a tour of where the movie was filmed.

0345525558|3.0|As I read this book I felt very uncomfortable at times. Victoria would do things like throw herself down on the pavement and just lie there. She'd run through the streets with no regard for the traffic. I couldn't figure out how she survived. I couldn't figure out how in the world her baby survived when she just left her all alone and went to sleep in the park all night. I was actually hoping that CPS had found the baby and took her in. I got tired of worrying about the poor baby and whether or not Victoria would kill her or throw her off a bridge because she had no role model of a loving parent.<br />I'm definitely a gardener and lover of flowers and that's the one theme that probably helped me finish the book. The part about her starting her own flower business was very unbelievable to me, especially because she was hardly ever present and left a young girl to do all of the work for her.<br />I was surprised that the book ended on a good note.<br />Overall, I found this pretty depressing and unrealistic.

The second one is very in teresting in terms of the information and background it gives but the sex scenes are sort of \\"thrown in\\" with little relevance to the story. All in all it's good.  I am curious to see what topic will be covered in the third book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a very quick and easy read, and I love all three of them! I highly recommend reading them close together so the story line flows.
1609611543|5.0|I'm fairly certain that I have been gluten intolerant for years but have never been diagnosed. My parents were the type that never took me to the doctor unless I was bleeding. I remember having intense stomach aches after dinner when I was very young, along with multiple bowel problems. I have also always battled with my weight, only winning when I starved myself. I have been eating gluten free for a couple of weeks now and have already dropped 15 pounds without exercising at all except for what I do at my job. This book has truly changed my life and I look forward to what's to come with future research.

B00001ODHJ|5.0|Ultimately the most best of all movies in this series. A most definate must see for the ultimates of ultimate movie lovers of action movies such as this one!!!!!!
B008D36INE|1.0|This film was destined to be polarising from the very beginning. Effectively an Art House depiction of despair and the longing to break free of social shackles.<br /><br />In one camp will inevitably be people who will think this is a poignant, touching and a starkly beautiful account of a womans bid for emotional freedom and subsequent spiral into despair when things don't work out.<br /><br />In the other camp will be people like myself, who found this film self indulgent and painfully dull. From the start I was massively irritated by the jarring, screeching violin score. This went on for so long that I genuinely thought that there wasn't going to be any dialogue, just a succession of flashbacks with that terrible music laid over the top.<br /><br />Finally, the music abated and led into an hour and a half of complete misery with iceberg slow, laborious cinematography. This would include in the main part the (fantastic) Rachel Weisz being filmed sitting or standing in a drab 1950's bedsit, usually smoking and looking thoughtfully into space/out the window. The rest of the film is filled with people in the depths of despair all for their own various reasons.<br /><br />To be fair, the acting was superb by the entire cast, particularly Weisz, and there were some (very) brief moments of enjoyment in the film. Technically, the film was very well made and had a lot of attention to detail. The technical ability of Terence Davis or the acting ability of the cast is absolutely not in question here however.<br /><br />Now, before I get a torrent of critism and comments along the lines of \\"you obviously didn't get what the film was trying to achieve\\", let me say that this isn't the case. I fully understand what the film was trying to achieve. It was trying to make the audience empathise with the suffering of the characters. And, to be fair again, it does this very well. A little too well perhaps as I was thoroughly depressed when the film had finished and so were the otherpeople I saw this with. The film came across to me as pretentious and self indulgent with virtually no enjoyment to be had. It may have been successful in what it was trying to achieve but in my opinion, films are entertainment, not torture. If you leave a film wishing to the high heavens you hadn't just subjected yourself to it then something has gone horribly wrong.<br /><br />I am aware that I am not the target demographic and no doubt there will be people predictably thinking \\"go back to watching Die Hard\\" etc etc. Let me just clarify that I really can appreciate a good film. Unfortunately in my opinion, this film was one to forget. Listless, lifeless and dare I say it, at the same time a wee bit grandiloquent
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|is a good game to play it can be difficult to have patience but it is interesting. I would recommend it.
B0079IEPHA|4.0|From the first episode onwards, I loved this show. Gabriel Macht who plays Harvey Spectre, a suave, shark like lawyer in New York, hires college drop out Mike Ross, played by Patrick Adams, as his new protégé. Mike is a hyper intelligent rogue, previously making a living helping people cheat on their Bar Exams and lending a hand to his drug dealing best friend. After a brief demonstration of his abilities, Mike is hired by an impressed Spectre into one of New York's leading Law firms...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the series isn't perfect which is reflected in the four star review. I may be being a little finicky but the show can be guilty of being slightly formulaic i.e Harvey and Mike take on a case, encounter some unforeseen difficulties but eventually come up with a clever solution ultimately winning the day.<br /><br />Right, now onto why this is such a good show.<br /><br />Quite frankly, even with the above minor issue, this is by far one of the most addictive and enjoyable shows on TV. Macht plays Spectre with a superb polish, encapsulating the persona of a big shot New York lawyer with apparent ease but successfully keeping his character three dimensional, hinting at hidden moral depths.<br /><br />Adams is brilliant as well. His character is super intelligent yet naive at the same time, a balance which, from an acting perspective, is incredibly difficult to maintain. As a result of his naivety , he frequently has to turn to his mentor for help giving extra depth to their working relationship. Adams acts the part excellently and the viewer is forever wanting Mike to succeed but never completely sure that he will (despite my earlier comments).<br /><br />I think the main thing though, and this is something which a lot of TV shows don't seem to manage all the time, is that both of the protagonists are extremely likable, but for very different reasons. Their characters are an almost perfect balance for each other and continually take the story in different directions. Mike's career is often jeopardized by his shady past which gives an excellent progressive storyline thus not falling into the trap a lot of shows fall in to where it ends up being 'The Weekly Adventures Of...'<br /><br />In conclusion, regardless of a slight predictability, a fantastic show which I would highly recommend. Likable and clever characterisation, excellent stories, intelligent script and enough of a progressive back story to keep you going back.

B004EPZ084|2.0|I can't shake the feeling that this film could have been properly hilarious and am still slightly irritated that it was as mediocre as it turned out to be.<br /><br />The story goes, three mates are suffering at work due to the horrendous bosses that they work under. Having had enough, they decide to take matters into their own hands and have them 'bumped off' with hilarious results...apparently.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this film could have been great if only the writers had put a bit more thought into it. The story feels lazy and by the numbers. Whilst some characters are pretty entertaining (ie Spacey's psycho and Farrel's sleazebag), others felt like filler. Aniston was more cringe worthy than funny, relying on simple smut rather than actual humour. It's like the writer has spent his life fantasising about her and thought it was a great opportunity to vent his deviancy all in the name of comedy.<br /><br />As for the three main characters played by Bateman, Sudeikis and Day, they have moments of brilliance but all too often lapse into the standard gross out/shock tactics that seem to be the American comedy standard at the moment. I mean as soon as one of them started wiping his a*se with his bosses toothbrush I thought the script was grasping at straws a bit.<br /><br />Also, why have they cast an oscar winning actor like Foxx in a part where he not only isn't funny, but isn't even interesting?<br /><br />I know the film isn't meant to be high brow or anything and I wasn't expecting it to be, but why can't comedy writers just think a bit more about what might get a belly laugh rather than a smirk? As I said, lazy and by the numbers.
1573225517|5.0|I got this book in great time, i need it for school for a English class. This book is great, I'm only half way done but you don't want to put it down, its very interesting. I bought this book used, and it has barely any signs of use. Thank YOU!!

B0088TG252|4.0|Not quite 4 stars though close enough I gave it that.  Plenty entertaining, and pretty well done.  Each actor did his part well.  Story was pretty good.  Couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it lacked a little something you kept hoping it would have. Maybe more redemption for Denzel's character.  A better ending would have helped.  The ending seemed rushed, abbreviated like they ran out of time or ideas.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I got this app a very long time ago. it worked fantastic. then with the last update it just stopped allowing me to download music. or watch videos. please fix
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The book is totally absurd, and absolutely cute and readable.  Non-stop humor (and sometimes interesting philosophy regarding the foibles of humans).  The author isn't exact regarding history, but who cares.  Even several of the historical characters come out as human beings after all, and not just personalities in history books. I couldn't put it down.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|Enjoyed the book. I liked the fact that Mitch Albom told the story of time in the style using past and present skillfully mixing the two so you knew exactly where you were at all times.  The story makes you reflect on your own use of time and its importance but more importantly that you need time to rest, reflect and enjoy life.
B008ANFRGQ|3.0|Being the owner of a few Vai albums I would say this one is about mid range, or maybe a couple of pegs above. Good album overall, marked down 1 point for the god awful racket that is 'John the Revelator'....Not sure where you're coming from with that one Steven. The vocal tracks are all good (apart from the aforementioned)

B003TSEEDY|5.0|My previous favorite book was \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl S. Buck.  I'd heard about \\"The Perks of Being A Wallflower\\" for many years (since it was released when I was a young adult), but never got around to reading it.  Now that the movie is about to be released, I knew I had to read it quick since I really want to see the movie.  One morning, I woke up and decided to read some of this book before getting my day started.  At first, I wasn't sure about it due to the form in which it is written--letters from the main character, Charlie, to an unknown friend.  However, After the first 30 pages, I was hooked and didn't put the book down until I was completely finished.  My time was definitely not wasted, either.  This book is possibly the best book I've ever read--touching, endearing, sad, happy--it had me totally invested in all of the characters and what was going to happen next.  I would highly recommend it to any young adult--or adult, for that matter.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love this movie. I loved each character individually, and as a group. The best thing is I have never seen Thor, or Captain America, yet this movie gives you just enough background so you aren't totally in the dark. (I will be watching both in the near future though) ;-) The banter between the super heros and master assasins was funny and the fight scenes weren't too long or pointless. I do, however, have one serious complaint. People on these Amazon review forums need to learn that this is supposed to be a review about what you as the viewer thought of the movie itself, not a place to complain about the quality of the DVD/Blue Ray, the shipping of the product, or an issue about the seller it was bought from. If you look at the one star reviews, very few people are complaining about the movie itself. Ridiculous!

B007V65R54|5.0|Society needs the ability to predict. What magnitude of earthquakes should we expect in the next 50 years when setting building codes? Is New Orleans' levy design sufficient to protect it from hurricanes likely to occur in the next 30 years? Will it rain tomorrow? Will I catch the flu if I don't get a flu-shot? Will housing prices keep rising for the next five years?<br /><br />All of these questions are probabilistic, and a society, government or individual's response should optimally be different depending on the likelihood of different bad things occurring. If good decisions are to be made, reasonable forecasts are needed. Would you get a flu-shot if there were less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of you getting the flu this season? What if it were 1 in 3? The effectiveness of our government, our safety and even our livelihood are constantly bet as a stake on predictions.<br /><br />The author identifies several problems with predictions that most decision makers ignore or don't understand. First, many modelers mistake ignorance for knowledge. A black swan event (an unknown unknown) which has never been observed is predicted to be impossible. With different approaches and more creativity, these black swan events can be foreseen. The author gives examples of why the possibilities of a housing bubble burst, the 9-11 attacks on the Twin Towers, and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (with ensuing nuclear meltdowns) should been anticipated, or at least seriously considered.<br /><br />Second, forecasters don't pay enough attention to the certainty of their forecasts. What if a river is projected to crest at forty-nine feet, and the levies will protect a town to fifty-one feet? Is the town safe? It depends on the certainty. Given a projection, one can estimate how likely a disaster event -- in this case, a flood above fifty-one feet -- is to occur. There is a big difference in a 1/1000 event versus a 1/5 event occurring. But what if no one even asks, \\"how likely is this flood to occur\\", assuming the town is safe? After all, forty-nine feet is less than fifty-one.<br /><br />Third, many making predictions have no interest in accurate and precise projections. There are many reasons why this could occur. At a minimum, those with motivation to be inaccurate should be discounted.<br /><br />When I read this book, it was all logical and made perfect sense. I was entertained on the way, as the topics were diverse and interesting. The book was very readable, but also very scholarly. Nearly 1/3 of the book was dedicated to footnotes, verifying the extensive facts included in his stories and scenarios.<br /><br />Who should read this? Anyone that relies on the advice of others. If you hold an elected office, or make any type of long-term decision based on what others tell you, your decision-making process will be improved. If you are a modeler, even already successful, you should read this also as a sanity check to what you are doing.<br /><br />I don't normally address author bio's, but this one is unique. Nate Silver designed Pecota ratings for MLB, which were used by many professional sports bettors world-wide. His fivethirtyeight blog on US elections is considered one of the best predictors of US elections (and is also used by many professional bettors). I doubt anyone is more qualified to address the topics in this book.cur\\", assuming the town is safe?

1455502758|4.0|This is a collection of essays of searing honesty and wit written in face of what TS Eliot called \\"the Eternal Footman.\\" Words like mordant, unflinching, and Voltaire come to mind. You might not like Hitchens' tone, and I didn't like his booming bravado most of the time, but I grant him my respect here because the book is a great antidote to the sentimental waxings on cancer courage. The essay against Nietzsche's oft-abused maxim \\"That which does not kill us...\\" is worth the price of admission alone. Sobering, acerbic, and wise. A great read with many a tart observation by no-nonsense mind of first order.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is my new favorite way to spend a relaxing rainy day! And this app makes it easy to use. Update cleared up a lot of bugs and now its even better!

B003EYVXTQ|5.0|I almost turned this movie off in the first 20 minutes because it's just. . .so . . . very . . . white trash. The dialogue grates. But I toughed it out. It was a bit like watching Shakespeare -- once you get used to the flow of how these people talk, it's not a problem.<br /><br />The setting is so bleak, and the people are all so unlikable. So why the rating? Brilliant performances by Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes (and a solid cast all around). A fully fleshed-out world with complex characters. And brave storytelling.<br /><br />I read a few reviews while I was trying to decide what I wanted to say, and some of them mentioned Lawrence's character Ree as a noir detective who is way over her head but can't stop. I think the description fits. All she can do is keep trudging forward because the result of her actions means the health and survival of \\"her children\\" (in this case, her two young siblings). Ree has a strong sense of morality, but she's not playing the usual game of what it means to be nice and good. (she's as bitter towards the cops as she is towards drug dealers) She's something of a strong, silent type -- a detective of few words, just as Sam Spade might be.<br /><br />Winter's Bone grows on you and gets under your skin. It asks questions about family, loyalty, right, wrong, duty, and sacrifice. And it doesn't give any easy answers.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I liked Dungeon Hunter 3 at first but then I got my first game freeze on my kindle fire that reset my toons progress level to 1. I didn't mind that much then because I was at a lower level 16 when it happened. Then my second game freeze happened at around level 25 or so and this time it got to be more of an issue. But again I still had my same gold and gear so I kept playing so I was able to zoom through the lower levels. But then I was on my 6th and final game freeze (I can't take this $@*# any more!!!) and reset, this time not only did it take my level 63 toon down to level 1 but all my Gold and Gear was erased as well. If I had purchased any of the gold and diamonds that they offer to sell constantly. I would really be upset by the endless game resets. So if you own a Kindle Fire and I have read on-line other devices as well I hope you enjoy doing the same levels over and over again. Because I warn you it can and will happen.
B00846REIS|1.0|I read this book in less than 2 days, it's super short. Also the thing I really didn't like about this story was it was way too remeniscent of 50 Shades. It has the same basic story line and all the cheap lines like we complete each other etc. he has nightmares in the book because of his terrible abusive past, he's in love with her and her with him but neither wants to reveal it out of fear of getting hurt because of their damaged pasts. She has a step father. He has a loving doting younger sister. He's rich beyond her wildest imagination, but doesn't care about money. Does this sound way too familiar. That's because it is! Same book writes like a trashy romance novel with words like, c*nt and other tacky trashy words that would turn NO woman on! I don't recommend it at all!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Love this movie from start to finish! As some others have said, it is close to the games and even the first ones...love being pleasantly surprised with feeling like you're in the game again and subtle moments of memories!

I don't think she fits in.<br /><br />Gabys storyline killed me.  I felt her pain from beginning to end of this season, I cried for her.  Eva did a great job.<br /><br />Lynette - I love her character and the strength she has.  Watchibng her get smaller and smaller next to Tom Scavos growing ego. And the \\"ending\\" to her marriage.<br /><br />For the true fan it is a must have.
B005LAII7G|4.0|I just saw Dredd on Saturday.  Here's my verdict.  While it is not a masterpiece, I thought it was thoroughly entertaining.  It's not like the Stallone vehicle made in 1995.  The best thing in this movie was Lena Headly as MA-MA.  I never heard of her until this film.  She gave an excellent performance.  She created one of the best female villans of filmdom.  I would not want to mess with her. I also thought Dredd's partner, Anderson, provided a good performance.  As for Dredd, Karl Urban was good.  But the women in the film steal the show.<br /><br />Some of the 3-D effects were quite spectacular. I don't understand why the critics trashed this film.  If you are looking for a decent action film I would highly recommend it.  However, I would not let young children watch this film.  There is a lot of blood and gore.

0740748475|4.0|Finally a complete collection of one of the defining comics of our time.<br /><br />Very nice intro by Watterson. Pages laid out with 3 strips per page with the Sunday strips by themselves on a single page, in color. So a full week takes 3 pages. Beautiful detail, you can see the art very clearly.<br /><br />The strips are laid out chronologically, with publication dates printed. The stories that occurred later in the series (those that went longer than 1 week) are presented uninterrupted, with the sunday strip printed just after the story arc ends. If the sunday strip was part of the story arc, it is in the proper order. Very nicely done.<br /><br />Now the bad news. The binding kind of sucks. Others have commented on this, and it is true. My copy had bad binding from the get go. So far, no pages have fallen out, but you can see the glue has cracked. If I read this a few more times, well, who knows.<br /><br />The other issue is the slip case color portrait (actually the side shown in the Amazon product description) has faded from light exposure. And no, I do not keep this in the sun. It rests on a shelf with no real direct sunlight. Just noticed this when I had to take the book down to dust around the area. Kind of makes me sad to see that the fading is so obvious.<br /><br />The slip case can be difficult to remove the books, and this set is heavy. Be aware of this.<br /><br />So for what I paid, I don't regret it, but feel kind of disappointed that slightly better material was not used.<br /><br />You won't regret being able to read all the strips though, so plunk down the change and get this. Just be aware that this may not be an heirloom that lasts. It would get 5+ stars if the quality of the book itself was better. Bill Watterson gets 5+ for his work.

I know that this book came near the end of his career and over a decade after the original, but I had no problem getting into this book and look forward to reading the sequels.  While there is little wonder in the science fiction of the novel, the story keeps you rooting for the character and hoping he will accomplish his task before forces overpower him and use him to their own ends. The political intrigue is what keeps the story going and that is what needs to be expected when reading. The journey of the character is all the better with the intrigue hanging over his head. The author is one of the best in his genre and I would recommend that people read the series how he intended it.

8866131369|5.0|The Moleskine Weekly Notebook Planner allows me to stay organized. The notebook features one week on the left hand page and the right hand page is lined. Each day of the week provides enough space for five or so lines handwriting which is sufficient for the amount of information I record there. The lined page is large enough that I keep two To Do lists- one for work-related items and the other for personal items.<br /><br />The notebook is substantial and sturdy without being too heavy to carry in my purse. It's a great size especially considering it covers 18 months. I like that it has an elastic band to keep it from opening and the pocket in the back cover is also useful.<br /><br />The planner's paper is exceptionally smooth and pleasant to write on. Other reviewers have commented that the paper is too thin.  While the paper is thin, I haven't encountered any problems with this. I have been using the planner since June and haven't had any torn pages.  I will be purchasing this planner again.
