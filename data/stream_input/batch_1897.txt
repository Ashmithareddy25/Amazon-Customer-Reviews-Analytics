B008RC72G8|4.0|Loved the whole atmosphere of this movie.  Johnny Depp was fantastic as a vampire.  The whole cast was great. It makes me want to go check out the original series as I have never seen it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this book is great and awesome it had my eyes glued to the book for a long time!!!! i will give this book five stars
B00943SP0G|4.0|If you like the actors its an ok movie.<br />You can see some of the quality direction and acting you would expect in a Burton film but at the same time you feel like its a bit disjointed.<br />Disjointed I can overlook if I like who I am watching but it is noteworthy in a film with high potential.<br /><br />So I like it and it was \\"ok\\". But not a block buster.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|AMAZING!!!! It's been a long time since I've read a book in 24 hours, but this book grabbed me and pulled me right in. Highly recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Intense, addictive, and heartbreaking. I stayed up most of the night reading this book, I couldn't stop. Great characters in a dramatic story that I won't soon forget.
B007XF0VW2|5.0|just making the movie must have been a riot, and the result is a lot of fun, with a few life lessons thrown in.  Rampant property and tree destruction, but no human injuries.  In the genre of Porky's and Animal House.  Good acting by young unknowns.  Fun all around.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It's a good book, but it is longer that necessary.  The middle third drags on quite a bit with a lot of story that doesn't lend itself to the main plot.  Even though it's long, the back story is decent and gives the reader insight into the main character.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|arrived just as advertised, would recommend to anyone, nice to have all of the movies in one, compact package. thanks
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a beautifully written historical novel. Follet's ability to create several threads and weave them all together is fabulous.  Mr. Follet is a master story teller
B005LAII1C|1.0|I LOVE Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy type humor, and was excited to see Ted, but I could barely stay awake.  Most of the funny parts were already shown in previews, and it seemed more like a romance with him trying to make it work with his girl than a comedy.  I had a few small laughs, but had to drag through a lot of boredom to get to them.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very fun game. I wish there were more levels, but it was very engaging. Recommend it for those who like three match games.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I wish you could give half stars because this was certainly better than a 4-star book!<br />Hooper is very talented as evidenced by &#34;Slammed&#34; and &#34;Point of Retreat.&#34; She wins again with &#34;Hopeless.&#34;  I may never see that word the same again.<br />I thought I knew the story, and then out of nowhere she hits you with something.  And then again.  And it wasn't contrived, just not predicable which is refreshing.  When I saw &#34;missing,&#34; I gasped and I did again at &#34;Sorry, Princess.&#34;  This won't spoil it for you, but you'll know what I mean!<br /><br />1 out of every 3 women in this country are sexual abuse survivors.  This isn't a book spoiler -- she alludes to it on page 1 and you know by Chapter 2.  Well, you know if you are paying attention.  I say this only to say that because Hoover is so talented, it could be very difficult to read for some and definitely emotional for all.  You can't walk a mile in Sky's shoes and not feel something.  The topic is handled respectfully and is phenomenally done, but be prepared to see the world a little differently.  Good writing does that!!!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|We received this product in a quick manor and we liked the low price. The discs worked well and no scratches.
B000IEXVCC|5.0|Reiterating what others have said: perfect acting and camera, crazily suspenseful, at the end very confusing but awesome once you figure it all out.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I've loved all of Sanderson's books and this is no exception. Like all the others 'it's completely original, and even though it's short it has great character development.
1476712042|5.0|After having read all three 50 Shades of Grey, I really  got hooked on reading love stories. My friend recommended this book to me and personally, I really enjoyed reading it! I read it one day! I just couldn't put it down!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I might enjoy this if I could play it!  I will let you know when it does!  I love bingo.  Finally got my download, great game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book! I couldn't put it down! So much more emotion then the movie! I highly recommended reading this one!
B0059XTUEK|5.0|The movie was delivered as promised, no defects and packaged carefully. The movie was fun to watch and gave us a better idea of how Marilyn may have been.
0525953590|4.0|\\"The Particle at the End of the Universe\\" was both a challenge and a rewarding experience for this scientific layman. When it comes to particle physics and cosmic origins, Sean Carroll clearly knows his stuff and can communicate it well to the general public. Nevertheless, I suspect that Carroll and especially Dutton/Penguin wanted to be first out of the gate with a cogent best-seller on the Higgs boson (the stuff of Nobel prizes). While it looks like they have succeeded, I can point to a few things that have been sacrificed. What Carroll accomplishes with well-placed facts and a captivating story is undercut by the relevant material the publisher omits (not Carroll's fault).    Carroll covers a lot of ground in this fair sized tome, so why are necessary details like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle left out? He touches on the \\"intrinsic uncertainties of quantum mechanics,\\" like not being able to accurately measure a particle's position, and briefly mentions Werner Heisenberg by name, but goes no further. In his previous book \\"From Eternity to Here,\\" Carroll explains uncertainty more fully. The publisher may have assumed as much for this book, but not every reader will be on the same page. This book ought to be more stand-alone than that.    In addition, Carroll devotes a section to particle spin, which appears near the end without a discussion of quantum entanglement (one of the great enigmas of particle physics). More than once he cites observer frustration with quantum measurement, but says nothing about any influence this observer might have on the thing he or she is trying to measure. Consider the hypothetical thought experiment known as Schrodinger's cat, which confronts both quantum entanglement and possible effects of observation. Erwin Schrodinger, a quantum mechanics pioneer and Nobel laureate not mentioned by Carroll in this book, came up with the whimsical notion of placing a live cat in a box containing a sealed radioactive substance, an ampule of deadly poison, a moveable hammer capable of breaking the glass, and a Geiger counter. After a short time lapse, only a single atom need decay for the Geiger counter to detect it, and then trip the hammer which shatters the ampule releasing the poison which kills the cat. Be assured, fellow cat lovers, that neither Schrodinger nor his colleagues had any intention of carrying this out. He just wanted to point out the absurdity of the cat being both dead and alive at the same time, until an observer intervenes. As soon as the observer peeks in, the cat is either one or the other, but never both. No dilemma here, however, according to Danish physicist Niels Bohr, the \\"godfather\\" of the Copenhagen (\\"standard\\") interpretation of quantum mechanics and Einstein's friendly foil. The cat would be either alive or dead independent of observation. Please note that I have since revisited Carroll's \\"From Eternity to Here\\" and found good coverage of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger and his cat, and quantum entanglement. Since the publisher is the same (Penguin), then any blame for the present book's omissions must lie with Penguin's editors, not with Carroll.    Carroll devotes two pages highlighting some of the obstacles astrophysicist Vera Rubin has encountered in her long career. But in the bad old days, the situation was even more egregious for Henrietta Swan Leavitt. Leavitt was hired as a \\"computer\\" -- what they called female number crunchers who did the grunt work for astronomers like Edward Pickering and Harlow Shapely. Yet it was Leavitt who interpreted her findings on Cepheid variable stars, cracking open the door for Edwin Hubble to point the way toward our present understanding of a rapidly expanding universe. She would have been a finalist for the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1926, except for the fact that she had died in 1921. The Prize committee, unable to give posthumous awards, was not even aware of her death. Carroll could have mentioned Leavitt alongwith Rubin. Note: In her book \\"Bright Galaxies, Dark Matters\\", Vera Rubin shares Leavitt's story with her readers.    I respectfully disagree with one aspect of Carroll's point of view. He ascribes seemingly godlike qualities to the natural world, something non-theists generally do (i.e. Laplace, who saw \\"no need for that hypothesis\\" (God's power in nature)). Carroll sums up his position by saying: \\"There are certainly prominent examples of religious physicists, but just as certainly the real work of physics gets along without allowing anything other than the natural world into the equation.\\" True, in that science takes measurements of natural phenomena. Yet, many world-class scientists were serious religious believers and/or clergy, including Nicholas Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Blaise Pascal, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell, Gregor Mendel, Louis Pasteur, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Georges Lemaitre, and, more recently, John C. Eccles, Arno Penzias, Charles H. Townes, Vera Rubin, John Polkinghorne, Paul Davies, Kenneth R. Miller, and Robert J. Asher. Refusing to abandon their intellect, they weaved together seamlessly the threads of their science and faith. With neither expelling the other, scientific discoveries informed their faith, and vice versa. Be that as it may, when Carroll disagrees with scientists of a more religious persuasion, he does so with respect. Clearly, he appreciates the limits of science, avoiding scientism (the ideology that science is the final arbiter of all objective truth). And, in his \\"From Eternity to Here,\\" Carroll gives a nod to St. Augustine, calling him a \\"Father of the Church\\" who was \\"interdisciplinary enough to occasionally turn his hand to metaphysical issues.\\" It will be interesting to see Carroll's approach as he tangles with William Lane Craig on February 21-22, 2014. No predictions here, except that, unlike the Super Bowl and the Nye-Ham debate, this one should at least be close. Note: Itwas.    To sum up, this is a very engaging book that I am glad to own. Carroll offers much close-to-the-pulse information on the Higgs boson, as well as on the major players involved in its discovery. It really helps to have such good contacts, and you get the feeling that Carroll was right there with them as the drama unfolded. Also, Carroll does a great job of explaining the unique importance of the Higgs boson: how it fits into and largely completes the jigsaw puzzle of the Standard Model theory of particle physics, as well as predicting that its discovery will have a revolutionary effect on physics and on our lives. With that said, a dedicated reader can still benefit from other points of view on the Higgs boson. Fr. Dennis
B0083SBJXS|5.0|All star cast and each one was picked perfect for their character. If you love comic movies then you'll love this!
B0067R0APK|1.0|Update:  Just received the new update and the app is somewhat better.  Better<br />interface, multiple maps and columnized categories.<br /><br />Now to the major problems:<br /><br />1.  Current weather for my location is terrible.  Weather bug much better.<br />2.  When trying to access daily,  \\"accuweather not responding\\" comes up.<br />3.  New columns do not align properly.<br />4.  Animated maps are jerky and need a longer time sequence.<br />5.  App is now so slow to load that it displays error messages.<br /><br />At least the annoying \\"for sale\\" is finally gone.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Worth every penny. Even the 3 year old watch it all the way through. Highly recommend the rental or purchase.
0143112724|5.0|This classic, favorite go-to reference for every writer who means business came smiling into the 21st century<br />with a refreshing new look and--dare I say it?--style. Kalman's delightful illustrations add a new dimension<br />that seems as timeless as its surroundings. Pictures! Who wouldda thunk?
B009MF56GC|5.0|We received the movie quickly. We especially liked the low price. It's one of the best action movies ever made.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I never watched this show on TV but did get a season on dvd from Netflix - that did it I was hooked. Great show and a very unusual premise.
1451695195|5.0|Without spoiling certain aspects of the book I would say the author was divinley chosen to go through this experience. If your a believer you will enjoy this book and may even find some peace in having a glimpse at the afterworld. If you don't believe I doubt this will change your perspective but it is still a good read and will  challenge the idea that spirtuality and science should not be considered connected.  The worlds greatest ideas were often thought to be obsurd at one point in time. I think Eben Alexander is helping to push the idea that science would benefit from embracing the concept of spirituality as a force that is real and that needs to be embraced to help further understand things we as humans have not yet been able to identify through scientific measures.  His detailed description of Heaven is good, but it is clear that words are not capable of doing justice to what he experienced. This is a common aspect when reading books on this topic.
B003VV6356|3.0|I have Monty Python's megaset of TV episodes. I thought that these would be different videos but when I received this order, I found that I already had them, so I gave them to my brother. The Benny Hill discs only included Season 2, not 1 and 2, as I had hoped. Perhaps it's my goof; nevertheless, buyer beware and be aware. These may be duplicates of something you already have.
B009RH973I|4.0|I got this with a 40% off coupon deal from Amazon Local. So the total price with taxes came out to something in the low twenties. I would pay no more than twenty bucks for this. It's a good case, it has a very tight fit so it does a good job of keeping a slim profile. We'll see if it'll last long with this tight fit. The cover does fold back to form a support for you to stand the Kindle up. The mechanism isn't perfect - the cover slides into a slot in the back of the case but it doesn't &#34;lock&#34; in this slot, so it will slip out easily. The case itself feels good in the hand as does the front cover. Again, this is totally worth twenty or twenty-five bucks, but I wouldn't pay thirty-five plus tax on it.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Sent as a Christmas present to a friend in England and reports are that it went over big.  It's a good addition to his collection of jazz music.
B006671NPM|5.0|We received this product in a quick manor and we liked the low price. The dvd is a good high quality dics.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|In typical Clancy fashion he has you glued to the chapter and then he bounces you to another part of the world. It's a very good read but it does have it's slow spots - that is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Really fun and cool game everyone who thought it was horrible was tellin a huge lie. Awesome APP spool glad I got it!!!!!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I was glad to find it still available ......... will enjoy watching again many more times.  I also listen to the soundtrack.
B000093FLA|5.0|Really like this movie. Great heist movie; very tongue-in-cheek at times. It was hilarious. Be warned, it doesn't shy away from horrifying realities of gore and the like, so not for the weak of stomach on the whole, but this is confined to a few scenes, so it's not a &#34;Gore everywhere! All the time!&#34; type of movie.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|I wanted to read this book for a long time, as it fits with my belief structure.<br /><br />That's the only good thing I have to say. Too heavy, too many big words, very difficult to understand - It's more like a thesis than a book.
075669812X|5.0|I bought 2 of these books for 2 kindergarten boys I babysit for.  Their parents said they LOVED them!!  Shipping was fast and arrived perfectly!
B000SXBPAS|5.0|Duran albums. Just cancel Femme fatale that really has nothing to do with the album. All the rest is amazing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I only write reviews for books that dig deep into my heart and take my breath away.  This book did it to me.  I loved loved it.  I bought it last night just cause it kept coming up on my facebook page as a recommended.  I am so glad that I did!  I stayed in bed the entire the entire because page after page it just kept getting better. Not wanting to spoil it for anyone, I am hoping that we may see a second one to this one???????????? Possibly???  Maybe??????  I want to know what happens next. Anyhoo, you have to read this.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Lol! So funny! I hope the next book is even funnier! I love this book! I also hope in the next book that Greg gets into even more trouble.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|It is pretty lame for the price.  I thought it would be nicer.  The edges are starting to fray after only a few days.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is the kind of book I read - non-fiction war. Unfortunately, there's a lot of this kind of book. The first half or more concerns the author's training and experience. While interesting, it's nothing I haven't read before. It's obvious that the book is written by a non-author, which I can get past as there's a lot of this on the market, but the actual killing mission could have been told with more, oh, imagination, maybe? I found it all very antiseptic and devoid of emotion. However I'm happy to know of the mission that killed that SOB, and am happy to spread it around.<br />Finally a common complaint with Kindle books: I know they're all transcribed by hand, but, holy jeez, the punctuation and font - which is just all over the place - detracts from whatever book I'm reading, including this one.<br />Still, not bad.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Stop reading reviews and just read this book! It's amazing in both predictable and absolutely surprising ways!  I'm floored at how much I absolutely love this book and I'm officially a Colleen Hoover fan!
B00138J32O|5.0|Nite Runner and Skin divers that are just awful, and you have a very good Duran album. Tricked out is more unuseful than bad. All the rest is very very good.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I won't bother reviewing the contents of this movie as many others have done so already. However, please be aware that if you purchase this collection it already includes the two movies \\"Razor\\" (the unrated, extended version) and \\"The Plan\\". Don't make the same mistake I did and purchase duplicate copies of those two.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it. Easy to play my kids enjoy all the games on here and you can unlock the other games rather fast.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great-looking game. Some aspects of the interface are really unique. I've only played the demo, but I definitely want to see more.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|These DVD were great gifts for my nephew and myself because we saw this show live at the HOB in Myrtle Beach,SC! The perfection of Peter Framptons Talent blows the doors off most Rock Guitar heroes of yesterday and Today! The Quality of the Live Video Recording was Superb! Anyone who is a Frampton Comes Alive Fan must have this DVD! You will love it as much as I do!
B005NJU8PA|2.0|This book is, for want of a better word, schizophrenic. Novices in the kitchen will get enthusiastic up until around a third of the way in, entertained by various anecdotes and diversions into various subjects including memory hacking and language learning, only to be stymied by a complete shift into survivalism, urban foraging and killing and butchering your own meat. The later stages of the book do return to recipes but these are mostly experimental techniques that are absolutely not in the scope of the beginner cook, unless you find yourself in the same uber-achieving alpha savant circles as the author.<br /><br />Plus, people outside of the USA will not get value out of this book. Apart from an emphasis on gun ownership and rural game hunting, there is a large section at the back covering ratings of various North American restaurants. This really should have been made clear before purchase.<br /><br />Some of the techniques and insights were useful, plus much of the remainder of the book was a pleasant enough read in a general interest fashion. As someone trying to learn the basics of cooking, on the whole I am disappointed with what started out promisingly but turned into a completely different book halfway through.
B0041ZUGEA|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums. The weakest songs being So misled and Proposition which are still pleasant to listen to. I love it!

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was a lot of fun.  The graphics are really good and the game is challenging enough to make it worth playing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very relaxing and challenging. I am enjoying it very much and highly recommend. I played over 100 levels when I first got the game before forcing myself yo put it dowln.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Purchased for my 23 yr old son that likes the old Star Wars movies. He was thrilled to have them in blu-ray.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|You really have to pay attention to follow. I didn't think there was as much action as the orginal bourne stories, but it was good. Good sound and picture.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was interesting to see the continued development of characters and the problems they encountered.  I enjoyed the way Ana grows and handles the changing Christian.
B004G6009U|3.0|My daughter loves this movie and I love watching it with her. To bad the shipping Hella sucks it took me about 2 weeks to get it... Well as long as I got it that all that matters :-)
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I loved this game and I have been playing it for a week and I was at level 27 and then it started over on me!!! I hate that it happened to such a good game and now I can't even trust it any more. Devise: Kindle Fire
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie is good as a stand alone story.  I have read the books and knew that some of the minor details were not as they happened in the book.  Still it is an entertaining movie.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Really like this game! Can't stop playing it! I think it could be good exercise for my brain too.... I need all the help I can get with my memory for sure. Thanks for the free download
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to use.  Quit and come back, the game is right where you left it. I wish you had the ability to make the cards a little bigger otherwise a great game
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Many people rant and rave about the physical things between Ana and Christian.  I enjoyed the developing of the characters, the way they grew.  It was interesting to have the Ana's insights and unspoken thoughts.  There is more to the book than just the sex!
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Got them all in good timing there all for my wife. Know she owns 4 out of 5 movies she so happy about that
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love the cooking dash series of games and I am so glad it is available for my kindle!  the kindle version is exactly like the pc version but easier imo with the touch controls.

0345803485|1.0|Someone gave me a copy of this piece of total garbage. I was incredulous that more than 10 people read it and liked it, much less thousands. I've read several of the 4500+ reviews that gave the book a \\"1.\\" I assume that if Amazon offered negative integers, many of the reviewers would have availed themselves.<br /><br />The most fun I had related to this book was reading these reviews. A whole lot more articulate and intelligent than slogging through that \\"thing\\" with the tie on the cover.<br /><br />Thanks, all you reviewers out there, for redeeming my 50 Shades experience!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Seth MacFarlane should stick to making cartoons. There were some amusing lines, but it just didn't feel right. My wife would have given it one star.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school (2000). I loved it the first time and loved it more the second time. I recommend this book to all freshmen in high school.
B000YDI9UG|5.0|Purchased these as a gift for My 21 year-old son. He really likes them. The fit is true to size and they look great!
B009ZE27US|1.0|All over the map. A bit of a party trick but you will get all sorts of different ages, depending on which finger you use and how hard you press. Pretty silly if you ask me. Use it a few times and you're done.
1401307450|5.0|The book starts with Anthony sitting in his living room and writing to us. You do have the feeling of being there in that living room. He writes in a friendly but honest style. About the fun part but also the drug issues etc. The book has plenty of fun and colorful pictures in it, truly for fans!!! Enjoy.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|If like me you only need the current conditions and a basic forecast each day, this app will do the job very nicely. No frills, only the information.
B007SGM084|2.0|I thought this book was okay. Kind of poorly written...a lot of descriptive sexual parts but the story line wasn't that good
B005K17RU0|4.0|seems to work great and is very accurate. wish it showed wind direction on 15 day forecast.  but other than that it seems to be fine.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great and allows me to continue pinning even when our house computer is taken!  Which  is not always a good thing ;)
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I like this game because you get to see how disease spreads and how humanity might counter such diseases. but its also sick because your main goal is to wipe out all of the earth population. hard at first, but once you know what your doing, its not so bad
B002LMV7TS|4.0|Great price, great movie! It arrived promptly so we could all watch it this holiday season. I do wish they'd cut out Cindy-Lou's singing parts....

B0086700CM|5.0|I find this app fun and adictive i could not put it down :) I recomind this app for every one who likes skill and quick thinking apps :)
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app really does work great!  With being a 1 computer household it is nice to have this app to manage my emails.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a wonderful game that has kept me busy for hours and hours. And it will continue to keep you busy solving the puzzles.The nice part is the increasing skill levels. I am totally addicted! This is an awesome game that will keep your brain sharp.
B002M9WW30|3.0|I continue to recieve quality product and service through Amazon. The blu ray quality of this was not as good as I had hoped. It's not much cleareer than the DVD's.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|We all can make a difference and likely DO.  Would it be all wonderful to see the footprint we leave?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read so many post-apocalyptic novels that have been truly disappointing. I expected the same kind of poorly written, poorly proofread, survivalist freak genre this time,too.  It was, therefore, such a pleasure to read this collection.  Well written, good character development and a plot with a purpose.  Thank<br /> you, Mr. Howey, for a can't-put-it-down, great read.  It's got meat and good bones and I will be back for more. Hope you do a 6!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is a very fine product and works as stated. The long range  is for 15 days and seems ideal for planing.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was a little sceptical of this app at 1st.  A lot of the previous reviews were of people having problems with it.  But since it was free I thought I would give it a try.  It has worked great for me, no problems at all.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My 9 year old daughter really likesit. It seems to keep her attention for a long time. Totally worth it.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I grew up listening to the Original Broadway Cast Recording with Colm Wilkinsn, Terrence Mann, and Randy Graff.  However, I was simply blown away by Anna Hathaway's rendition of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; from the trailers.  In some ways, this version is like a rendition / cover.  It's definitely not the same as the broadway in terms of vocal strength... but the emotions of the characters were conveyed extremely well by the actors.  I was kinda irked by Russell Crowes singing throughout... but his suicide song was adequate.  At this time, I have not viewed the movie.  Those that saw the movie will probably like it much, much more.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What a great movie.  Had it in on my shelf for a while, finally got around to watching it on my 60\\" 3DTV.  AMAZING.  WOW!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game rocks. It is awesome. I recommend you  download it. It is SO fun!! I really like the Christmas update.
B004GJ1XU2|3.0|I saw this movie because a friend recommended it to me after we went through something similar to what happened in this movie. I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. It could be because it failed to portray the situation the way I experienced it in real life, but I just didn't really care for the movie. So, it gets 3 stars from me. Others may like it more, and I wouldn't discourage anyone from renting it if they want to... but for me, it was just okay.
B0035FQ1UU|1.0|One of two things has to be true with this movie: either the writers and director have zero respect for the audience and purposely crapped out something as insulting to our intelligence as this movie, or they really tried to make a quality movie, and no one told them in the process that the plot unfolds like something a 6th grader wrote. More cliches per minute in this movie than any I've ever seen. Just garbage.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|So glad I bought this item - no commercials and it brought back really good memories. always a plus to have
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|I was so excited to see this movie I took some friends on opening night, it was a Hammer production after all, and the previews looked awesome. It was terrible, my friends still prod me for suggesting it. I'm a huge horror and Hammer fan and this movie is just long, boring, and hard to get through, it's one of those movies that strings you along for what seems like endless hours, you keep thinking somethings going to or got to happen at some point, it just never does. It's just not a good film. The atmosphere, costumes, period and look of the film are great, and I suspect people that gave it favorable ratings have never seen any good 50's, 60's or 70's gothic horror, or they are Danial Radcliffe fans, the acting, atmosphere and cinematography of this film are above average, but the film is just long boring and forgettable.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Loved the book.  I recommend this book to all who like adventure and who enjoy seeing the good guys win.5 stars
B009KHCRVO|1.0|I have not seen the movie, I could not get the streaming to work properly.  I watch streaming movies on Hulu, Netflix, Google, Amazon and TimeWarner Cable.  I rented Iron Sky to watch and the streaming performance was pathetic to put it mild.  I have never encountered this problem.  Considering the recent issues Netflix experienced with their streaming service, which is provided by Amazon cloud services, I am concerned Amazon may have more issues managing their cloud.<br /><br />This review may not help you to know if the movie was good or not, but due to playback just know that you may not get the same quality as the headline movies Amazon is showing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Best game out there very few ads. Keep the new levels coming. Thanks for the hours of fun and entertainment.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great Book.  I was scared it was just going to be more of the same, but it is so much more than that!  It is hard to put it down, and when you reach the end, you are so thankful the last book is finished and ready to read.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves all of these books.  He read this one in less than a day and he thought it was great.  My daughter is excited to read it also!
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I just received kindle hd for Christmas. I can't play my gardens of time game and was looking for something similar to play on my kindle.  I really like the game because it has different tasks to do.<br />I recommend it for multiple age groups. I like to play my games to clear my mind.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Going to read more from Nicholas Sparks!!!! I have seen most of the films based on his books, and now will go back and read the books.
0345803485|1.0|I thought I would jump on the bad wagon and read this serious just like everybody else I was hearing about. But not to far into this book it got a little to pornographic for me. Plus it was just really stupid. It was a waste of my money :-/
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book was pretty good. Pretty hot sex scenes. Overall a good story. I will read more books by this author
B005XN0SGU|4.0|Easy to use<br />If you want to use in the 7-inch tablet, the soft key is too small.<br />Otherwise, it is a good software
B007NG93CK|4.0|Fans of the genre will enjoy this offering from Kathy with an excellent story line and set of characters and the usual educational aspect of the work of an M.E.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I saw the movie about Rodriguez's life which led me to purchase the CD.  His music is time.  I have enjoyed listening to it and find the story about his life fascinating.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I put weather bug on everything, I think it’s the best weather viewer on the market. Try it you will like it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better than the first. Action, lust, and true love makes this book so gripping. Also there is a cliffhanger ending
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is fun and action packed with great humor!  Loved all the characters.... I can watch it over and over.
B009JBZH54|3.0|I loved the first two movies but the Dark Knight Rises was a swing and a miss. Not to mention, it appears the quality is a little grainy while watching in my home theater. Most likely due to the constant transition from Imax cameras to normal.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|No matter what he writes and sings, I truly love Phillip Phillips.  I am an admin for his fan club and enjoy doing it on his behalf, as well as reading what other club members have to say.  He is really my favorite new artist and that's saying a lot.  Saw him and the tour group perform in Columbus, OH.  Great show!
1400049628|5.0|Purchased this book for daughter. Received much more quickly than anticipated. She loved this book! Thanks so much for the interesting writing.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids watched this 4 times in 3 days.  We all love it and laugh a lot.  My biggest dislike of the movie is how catchy Mr. O'Hare's &#34;let it die&#34; jingle is.  I don't much care for my kids repeating that so I redirect them to focus on the more positive elements, which very heavily outweigh the negative.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Late to the party, but this is one of the best TV series I've ever seen. The stories continue to surprise (I'm on Season 3 right now) as the writers delve into controversial topics without flinching. Highly recommended.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Download would not work after 25 tries I quit.  Suggestion: better customer support needed, otherwise there is no sense in this.
B009P25TQE|5.0|When I heard Alboran's first music CD I fell in love and now after listening to Tanto...even more!<br />His songs are poems with music, they all have a message... I love this!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Lots of twists and turns.  Really holds your interest and keeps you guessing what will happen next.  You will love it.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I have no trouble with the controller, it feels great, but it is not specified that it DOESN'T includes a USB charging cable.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|These guys nail these characters. Always entertaining and the twists are delightful. I am hoping there are more episodes to come.
B009O2XY12|3.0|My 7 year old liked it but soon got bored with it.  Too simplistic for an adult.  Doesn't change enough.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing author and an even better storyteller!  I picked this up without really knowing anything about it!  I didn't want to know, I just wanted to read anything written by Colleen Hoover!<br /><br />This started out slow, I was afraid I was going to be disappointed. I only had to keep reading to know that I was in for the ride of my life!  The characters in this book are so richly developed that you easily get an amazing real life feel for them!  (My favorite is Breckin....just saying.)  They make you love them, they make you hate them, they make you want to \\"have their back\\" when they are faced with difficult situations.  They have your heart in their hands and they are not gentle with it at all!  Your heart is easily shattered....not so easly put together. This book with all of it's raw emotions will have you laughing, crying, screaming and holding your breath.  All these things make me pick up a book...it takes you into it's world, an imperfect world that is full of ups and downs.<br /><br />The author deals with subjects that we often don't talk about.  We don't want to think about these things, but they do happen and Ms. Hoover did an amazing job in writing about them. They were not glossed over and were not glamorized, but were an integral part in the story.  I loved this book.  The rawness of the emotions that it brought out were butterflyingly awesome!
0761169431|5.0|I got this for my nine year old son. It was a little difficult but he loved it. The paper included its really near. Highly recommended.
B008FOB124|3.0|I have enjoyed DcD for decades and was pleased to learn that they are back together. The new music is good, although some pieces lack the energy of the older stuff
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn demonstrates very good character development, and illustrates the in fighting of government agencies. Irene kennedy seems more collected and in charge than ever before, while conceding that Rapp is her Superstar.
B00785P2QC|1.0|you run out of coins within ten mins of turning on which is frustrating. This is one of the worst \\"free\\" games I've played, as you can do nothing without spending money and this game is not worth it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case works exactly as advertised.  The only thing that it doesn't do is turn the screen as the Axis does (but I knew that before I purchased it).  Otherwise, it is wonderful.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have a smaller head than most people so I have always loved these headphones. I haven't seen them in the stores anymore so very happy to find them on Amazon. They adjust for small head or large. They stay on your head when running but they do only have about a year life span. If they get wet or bent they won't work anymore. I used to buy these for $10 a pair. Loved them for running but they never even last a year before they wear out. I would definitely buy these at even a $30 cost, as I'm sure others would too, but almost $200 for that quality is ridiculous. I will find something else that will work.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|The CD is fairly priced, but doesn't have some of the main songs or even the entire song of some of the tracks.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|If it were not for the eye candy, I would have rated this terrible remake a solid one star.  No redeeming qualities at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! I've read it over five times and I always get 're-entwined with the characters, the action, and if course the romance! <3
B009E3EY4M|4.0|I LOVE Zeppelin. They were the most creative band out there. Every member was exceptional. Now I have seen every reunion show and was not entirely impressed. Both Page and Plant were past their prime and struggling to hang on. This time however they far exceeded my expectations. They were obviously well rehearsed and both Page and Plant regained some of their youthful powers. I was impressed by both of them. John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham were ridiculously great. Jason gave his father a run for his money. He and JPJones were incredibly tight and powerful. Page and Plant were awesome as well. It's just that they were soooo awesome back in 73 that they raised the bar way too high to compare. This show was really really great and I am happy for them that they were able to pull it off so well. I bought the damn show on every format available. Still waiting for my vinyl....sigh....
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I am a 35 year old woman and truly enjoyed this movie. My 1 year old son even sat still on my lap and watched this...that is quite a feat in itself. The movie has a very good lesson and meaning intertwined with great characters and a captivating story. I love that the main character is a curly, red-headed, independent girl who loves archery...so not the classic protagonist and a great model for children of today. I'm a diehard Disney fan and believe this is one to definitely add to the collection.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you like detective stories.,you will enjoy  good reading with out all. The  blood and guts.  Connelly is full of surprises
B000M4RG42|4.0|This is a good film, but it did not stir me the way I hoped it would.  I have been trying to figure out why I was not more drawn into the film.  As best I can determine, I think most of the distance is from the writing.  I felt at a distance with the characters, with the partial exception of the characterization of Ira Hayes (whom I was only previously familiar with through Bob Dylan's retelling of Peter LaFarge's song, \\"The Ballad Of Ira Hayes\\").  Hayes's struggles with what he was compelled to do for the war effort -- essentially be part of a PR campaign that had little to do with \\"truth\\" -- made his the most three-dimensional characterization in a film filled with one-dimensional forgettable/interchangable characters.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's filming is grand, and the movie is a success on a purely visual level.  So, averaging the flaws with the successses, the film is one I'm glad I saw, but I will not be viewing it again.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|The Magic Door is an excellent compliment to CRB's first release Big Moon Ritual earlier this year.  The Magic Door spent 3 straight weeks in my CD player before I ever took it out.  All of the songs are great, highlighted by the fantastic Vibration & Light Suite.  Chris Robinson has hit on a vibe that is both soulful and beautiful.  I hope there are more releases by CRB like this in the near future.  Keep it coming, Chris!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i could not stop playing this game every time i started i could not stop it was so addicting and i think people should get this game
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This version of mahjong gives you multiple choices and they are all challenging.  It is a real challenge and very interesting.
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this movie because everyone was just raving about it, and I really enjoyed it, you'd think whats so great about a movie of kids being forced in an arena to kill each other? but that is not the focal point of the story, its about so much more! and every time you watch it, you get a little more. I rented this twice, read the books, and finally I bought the disc and digital copy.<br /><br />I rated this 5 stars because the movie did not go to far from the book, and the actors portrayed the characters so perfectly.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is a delightful movie. I bought this movie because the play is coming to broadway.<br />I love albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. I wasnt sure where the story line was going at<br />first but what a delight this movie was. Especially the end. I will add this to one of my<br />classic movies. The love of a father and son. The struggles and growth of a realistic<br />relationship. A big lesson to be learned after watching this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Decent graphics and user friendly controls. Like playing with an actual deck of cards but a lot easier to redeal when you get stuck.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I can't believe it was free! It was such a great book that I read in one night!  I will definitely read other books by this author.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|its a nice game for like little kids but to me its okay ,dont know why i down loaded it but its an okay game
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is an interesting version of solitare.  If you enjoy playing solitare you will like this version.  It lets you select several versions to play.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Can not watch it enough. All the characters are loveable. A fitting follow up to the short lived firefly series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Probably the best series of books I have ever read. I can't imagine a better beginning paired with a better ending. The emotions brought about by this indescribably well read books are unimaginable. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I received this set as a gift when it came out in 2006 and have watched the entire series at least four times (not counting the 2-3 times my kids have watched the whole series nor the two friends who've borrowed it and watched the whole series). Everything about this set is magnificent, from the boxed-set-packaging to the file-folder-sleeves for each season. I couldn't be more pleased, then or now.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I'm just beginning to read The Walking Dead and after reading the first volume I am more than intrigued.... I'm hungry for MORE! READING it on the Kindle wasn't so bad and will download the rest of the volumes. One at a time.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|Great story, great graphics, but the text was too small to show up well on my Kindle. Very difficult to read.
B009LREA1S|2.0|After 2 great movies this movie ends up being a real let down.  Way too slow and over dramatic.<br />Such great potential too!
B00371XIP8|5.0|One of my favorite sequel movies. Took ten years of waiting for it, but well worth it. Laughs laughs laughs.
B00005R2IS|1.0|I wouldn't waste a single red cent on anything that this jew hating,racist,woman abuser acts in.This guy is a complete and utter psychopath!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I love this cd. I always meant to get it and finally did. I have played it many times since I received it. Happy I got it.
B0006J28MI|5.0|This is a great kid movie that I like to watch with my son.  DVD was in excellent condition and arrived in time.  DVD plays well and is enjoyable to watch.  Happy with purchase and will do business with seller again!
141659521X|5.0|I have all the Mitch Rapp series and The Last Man held up to Vince Flynn's high standards.  It is a must have.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was filled with twists and turns. It went from breaking your heart from the trauma the characters had faced, anger for the secrets being kept, to warmth over the love they had for each other and Day makes you actually feel that love. There were a lot of intimate scenes and I finally saw myself skimming through them after a while but it was never a dull read. Every chapter had an exciting scene that made you unable to put the book down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the set up of this game.  Try it, you'll like it.  Makes playing solitare simple and enjoyable, you will play it over and over.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I had always liked playing solitaire so on the Kindle it is way more fun to play it and easy too.
B00004RJ71|4.0|I got this also as a gift for my son. It is an old favorite movie of his. He enjoys it very much.
B000BCE918|4.0|Ths replaces the VHS that no longer can be played in our machines. My grandson is very very very happy.
0316227706|5.0|Pictures are vivid and so adorable.  There are many different shots of different dogs and each one is so funny.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I don't understand why people give this CD bad reviews. It's a great album. A Must-Have for true Breezy fans. I like how Chris is not as Explicit as, say, Lil Wayne, but still has awesome explicit tracks like Til I Die, Bassline, and Mirage. Also the album contains GREAT originally clean tracks such as Turn Up the Music, Don't Wake Me Up, 4 Years Old, and Stuck On Stupid! Overall, I love this album, and I'm sure you will too!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I really like to play Zoo Tycoon and this is a close alternative.  However, this game does not allow you to create the environments and take care of the zoo as in Zoo Tycoon.  its a very simplified version and you are limited in what you can do unless you are willing to buy peanuts which can add up quickly.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed this book from the moment I picked it up, and I have since shared it with many of my friends.  I couldn't get through the plot fast enough, and yet I was disappointed when it was over!<br /><br />Her writing is so descriptive I found myself captivated by her language.  She uses words that paint a picture so vivid, you can't help but feel like you're part of the book.  I decided to give this book 4 stars because I found the ending unworthy of the plot.  I didn't hate it, and it wasn't a let-down like other reviewers have mentioned, but I wish it had worked out differently.  That being said, I enjoyed this book during a hard-earned College break and it was exactly what I needed.  I would (and do!) recommend it to everyone.
B008AT9XOC|3.0|I have to preface my review by saying that &#34;Liitle Shop Of Horrors&#34; is one of my all-time favorite movies and definitely deserves a five-star rating.  The Director's Cut is a big disappointment, however.<br /><br />Before viewing this DVD and its Special Features, I was unaware that &#34;Little Shop Of Horrors&#34; was a re-make of a Roger Corman film of the same name which he made in two days, as a joke.  The Director's Cut DVD uses the ending of the Roger Corman film which is a radical departure from the theatrical release that most people have seen and loved.  I won't spoil the ending for those who may want to see it, but the film makers tested this version before live audiences prior to its release.  The test audiences enjoyed the movie right up to the end . . . then hated it.  Wisely, they decided to film a different ending  --  the one we all know  --  and the movie was an instant hit.<br /><br />All of that would be well and good . . . IF this DVD contained the ending of the original theatrical release, as most DVDs with the director's cut, do.  This one does NOT.  It contains only the Roger Corman ending.  That forced me to buy a second copy of &#34;Little Shop Of Horrors&#34; so I would have the original theatrical release version.<br /><br />My advice is not to buy this DVD if you want the original movie that you doubtless, loved.  If you already own the original and want to see this version, fine.  If you have never seen &#34;Little Shop Of Horrors&#34; please do NOT buy this version because you'll end up hating the movie, and that's not fair.  It's an excellent movie with the proper ending in place.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|We enjoyed it and so did our neighbors. They borrowed it twice. We still debate the ending. Reality of fantasy.
B00377E5SG|5.0|Review:<br />If you are looking for a fun movie to sit down and enjoy Sabrina is an excellent choice. This is a great film for everyone in the family!  I have 4 boys in my house and they loved it just as much as my mother and I.  This is not &#34;just one more romantic comedy&#34;.  It is full of plenty of one liners that keep you falling more in love with each and every character.  This story (originally written as a stage play) will captivate you in every way.  Watch it, and I'm sure like me, you will find characters similar to the people in your own life.<br />Harrison Ford's performance is so natural.  He, along with his costars draw you right in from the first line on.  If you have not seen it - don't wait a minute more.  Sabrina is clean, funny, and romantic.  You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />The Plot:<br />Sabrina, a young chauffeurs daughter, spends her days swooning over the youngest son in the family her father drives for.  In an attempt to enrich her life, her father sends her away to Paris where she ultimately grows up, finds herself, and discovers life outside her crush on David.  Meanwhile back home, David has become engaged.  His eldest brother Linus is thrilled, seeing a multi billion dollar merger opportunity with David's soon to be father-in-law.<br />Upon her return, her childhood fantasies unfold, as David starts to pursue her (his sudden interest may or may not have a lot to do with her new makeover).  Linus quickly takes it into his own hands to see that David does not mess up the merger.  Linus creates a plan to secretly woo Sabrina away from his brother, make David's paranoid future in-laws content, then abandon Sabrina after the merger is complete.<br /><br />Delivery:<br />As far as delivery goes, I got the movie in 2 days.  This may very depending on where you live.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|The Breakfast Club is a 1985 teen \\"comedy\\" written by none other than John Hughes, the king of 80s teen movies. TBC is what I personally consider to be one one of his top three best movies. It's amazing to me the same man responsible for a movie like this went on to do movies like Baby's Day Out. But I digress.<br /><br />The Breakfast Club brings together some of the most famous of the Brat Pack, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Michael Anthony Hall, Emilio Estevez, and Ally Sheedy as a group of high school students (interestingly enough, only two were actually high school aged at the time) sent to Saturday morning detention. All come from very different walks of lives and had little to do with one another but now are forced to endure each other.<br /><br />When you really look at it, it's strange how such a simple plot for a movie can turn into such a well-loved and memorable movie, isn't it? I think it's because the characters are so great as well as the acting itself. I couldn't see anyone but Judd Nelson as Bender (though another random fact is originally the role was intended for Emilio Estevez).<br /><br />It really is a well-acted movie by all the principal actors. Each character represents a \\"clique\\" you probably knew in high school and there's likely a character that, to some degree, you'll be able to relate to the most which is another thing I think adds to the movie.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray quality, it was okay. I don't remember the quality on the VHS well enough to compare, but I have no complaints about the blu-ray.<br /><br />If you've never seen it, I think The Breakfast Club is very worth a viewing.
B003Y5H53S|2.0|This wasn't what I expected at all- the previews made it appear different. We ended up not even whatching the end of it.
B005FPT51K|4.0|the quality of the cam is good.<br />wireless is fine and no disconnection<br />controlling the cam through the iphone is a piece of cake<br />no complicated software & no installation complications.<br />the only missing thing is there is NO (Zoom-in and zoom-out) option but still the device worth it.
B0089BSM70|5.0|I still think of Halloween and Halloween 2 as the same movie.This version of part 2 is much better this time around.The picture and sound quality are what they should be.Plus lots of great behind the scenes stuff.If you're a Halloween fan,this is a must own for any fan of the series.
0525953728|4.0|My husband is in a rehab hospital and won't be able to read it in peace until he gats home.
1611760100|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. Really. I keep reading all the hype about the series and comments that the books improve as you read on, etc...But in my opinion, this was not the case. This installment actually was worse than the first.<br /><br />Overall, the premise of the story was interesting, but the pace was unbelievably slow. Seriously, I fell asleep too many times to count during this audio.....and that just doesn't happen to me! Thus I was constantly rewinding to re-listen to parts that I fell asleep on.<br /><br />I was expecting way more action. Based on how Matched ended I expected fighting and running....and we got a bit of that. But it was all toned down by reading poetry and excerpts from books they found. In addition to the lack of true action or suspense, the characters personalities were all muted and sort of bland. Nobody seemed genuinely scared or excited or determined. They all seemed liked they had downed several of those calming green (I think that's the color) pills. Every sentence seems calm and poetic.<br /><br />The one thing that I did like that was in improvement over Matched was that we got to hear from two different POVs. Kai's and Cassia's. I do feel like even though they are two different characters narrating, their differences weren't predominate enough. If I was reading instead of listening, I could see how I could get lost on who's chapter it was. Thank goodness the audio had both female and male narrators to clarify things.<br /><br />The female narrator reading for Cassia is the same from Matched, which was nice to hear her again. It helped keep the same feel to Cassia. I also liked the voice of the man that read for Kai. He had a good mature voice, where Kai didn't sound like a child like Cassia did at times.<br /><br />Like I said, the premise of the story was interesting and different. There was a lot of potential there, I just didn't feel that it reached as far as it could have. I didn't hate the book, but I didn't enjoy it that much either. In the end, not even the cliffhanger could keep me hanging on to this series. I will not continue on and read the final book Reached. I'm over it. Moving on.it that much either.

B003EYVXYQ|3.0|So, after two years, I finally saw Survival of the Dead for the first time.<br /><br />Survival features a second occurrence in the Dead universe--the return of a character seen in a previous movie. This time around it's Sgt. Crockett, the leader of the \\"highwaymen\\" in Diary who rob the main characters. This time around, he and the other deserters, along with a character called \\"Boy\\", find themselves on an island whose occupants belong to one of two main families, the O'Flynns and Muldoons.<br /><br />One family wants to exterminate the zombies and the other, to corral them until a cure is found (though one must wonder what they would do about gaping wounds, but this is a point not addressed). It just so happens the head of each family have been bitter enemies since childhood and O'Flynn wants revenge for  being kicked off the island.<br /><br />On it's own, it's an okay zombie movie. As part of Romero's \\"Dead\\" franchise, it stacks up somewhat poorly to the original three but is not much worse than Diary or Land (though I enjoyed Diary more and I'm still deciding on this vs Land). Here we get more CGI effects that in one case was pretty poorly done. Watch the fire zombie shot with a flare gun as its head lights up on fire. I thought it almost approached \\"webcam\\" affect.<br /><br />All in all, it's not really a bad movie. Just don't go in expecting the same level of the original three.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Blu-Ray version is really nice and has extra scenes you've never seen before, well worth the money.  I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more of the hunger games books. Worth the time.
B009E3EY38|5.0|If you are a Led Zeppelin fan you have got to get this package.Jimmy,John Paul,and Robert are in top form.But the real hero is Jason Bonham.If Jason would have chosen another path in life,this reunion would not of been possible.This without a second thought is the best concert of the past 32 years!I only wish like most people that they would of played their entire catalog.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|In my opinion, his voice is just too big and full for the pared-down, indie, acoustic-type sound he was going for. It still sounds great, but it's just too overpowering and unbalanced. With a few exceptions, the songs didn't really catch my attention or make an impact like they usually do. For the first time ever with a JG album, I found myself even the first time through wanting to skip multiple songs in a row and forcing myself to give them more of a chance.<br /><br />I became a Josh Groban fan because I really enjoyed the full-orchestrated, powerful songs (I really liked Voce Existe em Mim, War at Home, and L'Ora dell'Addio for that reason). I guess I'm just not into the indie stuff that's big now either, so that may have been a factor.<br /><br />Josh is a great lyricist and I'm excited about his next album. I can't fault him for trying to go in a new direction and I feel bad criticizing something he's described as meaning a lot to him, because you can tell his heart was in it. But overall for me, Illuminations was just kind of bland and boring and I probably wouldn't have bought more than a few songs had I not already pre-ordered. It's not bad at all, just not what I was hoping and expecting.

B0091THRCU|4.0|I love this case. It allows me to keep my iphone5 in my pocket with keys and change and not get dinged up. If you are like me and love not having a protective case on your iPhone, this is a great case. The stitching on one side was loose and started opening up as soon as I got it, but it just took a needle and thread to stitch it back up. Looked to be loose as soon as I took it out of the package, thats why I say it could have been caught by quality control, but wouldn't stop me from buying the product again!

0399160450|5.0|I have read all of Clancy's fictional novels. This is one of his best particularly among his last 6 or 7. Fast developing plot with some surprise twists at the end. I always breeze through his fictional works but this one was a quick read even thought it was 800+ pages..

0312430000|5.0|Brilliantly written to convey one critical point which our health care desperately needed, but the process is applicable to virtually every venture and business.  As Gawande says, if this were a product or service, every hospital in the world would buy it at any reasonable price...and it is FREE!
B000H6SXMY|4.0|This set was purchased as a gift for a Friends fan, and they loved it. It's great that it includes all the seasons in one set, although it is a little pricey. The packaging is really nice - all the DVDs are organized within a larger box for easy storage. On the set I received, one corner of the outer storage box had begun to split.  Not sure if that happened in shipment, or if it was pulled off the shelf that way.  I didn't attempt to return for another set, because of the timeframe (too close to the holiday), and all the DVDs were unharmed.
0451205766|5.0|This is truly an amazing book. It was incredible easy to read while still being descriptive and captivating. Puzo writes for the common person and doesn't try to go over their head with unnecessary descriptions. The Godfather is very relatable and deep on many levels! Must read!

B00571F26Y|5.0|I've read 20-something books on nutrition in the last couple of years. This one is obviously a very specific topic but an unbelievably important one. Even before I read this book I knew that wheat is bad bad news. &#34;Wheat is murder&#34; ya know. But book helped me understand exactly why. I quit eating wheat (and diary and sugar) two years ago and have lost fifty pounds. Went from 27% body fat to the 11% I am today.

B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Some good one liners, but not the greatest. It was nice to laugh after a long work week but not the comedy of the year.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|While book one of the trilogy became predictable and boring with its constant kinky f@&$ery, Fifty Shades Darker actually started to develop some interesting plot lines. I'm actually looking forward to the final book, much unlike the way I felt at the end of book one.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A classic I have read before. I haven't read it this time as of yet, but I plan on reading this with a granddaughter.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has me reeling!  Hope is such a strong girl.  Never knowing why she is the way she is.  Can't figure out why her mom is so weird.  Then she meets Holden.  No boy has EVER affected her in any way other than boredom.  He ignites her.  He fascinates her.  She scares her.  He makes her feel all of the emotions she has never been able to feel for the last thirteen years of her life since her mom adopted her.<br /><br />Nothing can be more profound than the unraveling of the sad past of Sky and her family.  Holden holds the key to answering questions neither of them thought possible.  His family has suffered for years too.  The coming together of these two ignites so many emotions that neither of them can seem to handle.<br /><br />This is a gripping tale of love, loss, hearbreak, loneliness, anguish.... It will have you on your seat from start to finish!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The book is great as it deals with many of human feelings, frailties, brutality, and last and foremost a desire to redress the wrongs.
B004QX07G4|5.0|It's so inspiring and funny. My favorite chapter in the book is this is 4 the teens it's so funny
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|The story was good but bounced around a lot.  I wasn't expecting a love story?  Since the story didn't end with an explanation, I expect their will be more coming.
B00006AW63|1.0|Very disapointed, bought DVD for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She's wanted this movie for a long time.  When we put the DVD to play, we can't see it.  We get a message WRONG REGION.  We have never seem this message.  She was so upset and cried for awhile.  It was terrible!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I thought I'd just watch a couple episodes and wait for it to show up on Netflix.  Watched the whole season...in 2 days!!
B0068FZ0GK|3.0|It wasn't important to me but if you care about the digital download it is worth noting that it expires in two days, so it will be of no use to anyone buying this now.
B0086700CM|3.0|A little difficult to maneuver. Takes some getting used to.Once you have it down pat lots of fun to play.

B007FJFDXS|4.0|Different enough to keep the kids occupied....and me....Flights are long and kids get bored easily. This keeps their minds and bodies in the seat.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|As a kindle owner, I've learned to be a bit wary of free editions of classic works as well as various &#34;illustrated&#34; editions.  I was so very pleasantly surprised with this little gem.  The table of contents is active and easy to navigate.  The illustrations are faithfully and beautifully rendered and placed properly within the story.  I hope the price remains &#34;free&#34; on this edition so that more readers can enjoy this timeless Christmas tale as Dickens intended.  Cheers all around!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I highly recommend this book. The main character, Sky, felt very relatable. The twist is intense and exciting. The book is rather emotional. I really loved it.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This was a good family night movie, however I had to cover my 3 year old's eyes for all the scary bear scenes. Not a stellar movie in the ranks of UP or Toy Story.
0395389496|5.0|This book is lovely and a welcome addition to my holiday collection.  I recommend it highly.  The pictures are wonderful, too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Collins uses third person, allowing her audience to be pulled down into the pages and emotions of the book. Her writing is excellent. She appeals to ethos, pathos ,and logos through her writing that has enabled the audience to believe and become trapped in the story. It was an excellent book for a variety of ages. So much better than the movie has portrayed.
B0086700CM|5.0|what is with these crazy fads!?!? THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT GAME but for me LIKE ALL FADS it comes and goes.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Horrible experiences.  Glad he has developed feelings for others who are still trapped in prisons in North Korea.  He seems to<br />suffer from what he didn't do now more than when he was there.  Survival was his only objective in the camp.  Would I be the same?
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book more than lived up to the previous three in the series. I have come to love and hate many of the characters in the book and am eager to start the next
B000FC146C|5.0|I love this story. I cried while reading all the way through the book.  I was heartbroken for Meggie, wanting the unattainabe love of Father Ralph; and beautiful Father Ralph, loving God more than Meggie; but still trying to fight against his attraction to her.  I watched the mini series, too. It changed things around, and had a much different ending.  The book was much better than the movie.
0345803485|5.0|The shipment of this book was very professional and quick. Definitely worth it.  The book itself looked brand new, not a crease, stain, mark or tear on it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. it is an awesome game. it is fun and interesting.I would recommend this game any time. great game.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Jack Reacher is not a bad film, though it will likely be a disappointment to fans already familiar with the character from Lee Child's series of Jack Reacher books.  It might even be a good film - to someone who's never seen any of the myriad similar action thrillers of the last forty years or so.  If however, like me, you have, then Jack Reacher comes across as more tedious than anything else, with more clich&eacute;s than bullets, dialogue frequently so arch you could cross the Mississippi with it, and not a single unpredictable moment.<br /><br />(*** Warning - this review does contain a few minor spoilers, but no major ones ***)<br /><br />The film begins with a long opening scene where we observe a sniper - mostly from the sniper's point of view, so we never really see his face - picking out targets, seemingly at random, at a nearby office park, the crosshairs of his scope lingering on one potential target after another but never actually firing... until finally he does, making six shots in quick succession and killing five people in the process.  The evidence found at the scene by the lead police detective, Emerson (David Oyelowo), quickly leads to a suspect and an arrest - James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former army sniper who lives in the area. With the evidence overwhelming and the case seemingly air-tight, Emerson and the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) offer Barr a deal - plead guilty and get a life sentence instead of going to trail and possibly getting the death penalty.  But instead of signing the deal, Barr instead writes three words on the plea agreement: \\"Get Jack Reacher\\".  Which is a bit of a problem as Reacher is apparently something of an invisible man:  a former army military policeman who has no known address, phone number, bank account, credit card or even driver's license.  The man lives as off-the-grid as it's possible to get.<br /><br />But before Emerson and Rodin can wonder much about why Barr wants them to get Reacher and how they might go about finding him, Reacher (Tom Cruise) suddenly appears at their office, for reasons of his own.  Barr's defense attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), who happens to be the DA's daughter, is also curious about why Barr asked for Reacher as even she - along with everyone else, including it seems Reacher himself - believes that Barr is guilty.  Her real reason for involvement is her opposition to the death penalty, which she hopes to save Barr from.  Reacher is also curious why Barr would ask for him, particularly given that he'd promised to kill Barr if he ever crossed the line again.  But they can't just ask Barr now because the man is in a coma resulting from a severe beating he received when he was put in custody with some other prisoners rather than in isolation.<br /><br />As Reacher begins to investigate, a number of things begin to not add up.  The evidence, he decides, is too overwhelming, too neatly convenient and convincing.  It also doesn't fit the pattern of a man who was army-trained to be a sniper.  Reacher's suspicions lead to questions which he presents to Helen as needing answers.  Their investigations quickly start provoking reactions, most particularly a crude attempt to intimidate and neutralize Reacher.  The evidence quickly mounts that something much bigger is at work, that the shootings were not random but had a purpose behind them, with conspiracy, corruption and deception all part of the mix.  The rest of the film proceeds to reveal all, with an abundance of fighting, shooting and chase scenes along the way.<br /><br />If all of this sounds familiar, it's probably because you've seen these elements in varying combinations in any number of action thrillers over the last few decades (or even more if you're older).  There is very little in Jack Reacher that is new or original and even less that is unpredictable, making the film, for all of its flurry of \\"action\\" sequences, somewhat tedious to sit through.  The cast has some talented actors in it but the characters are so clich&eacute;d and stock, and their dialogue so arch, that there's not a lot that they can do with them, from Richard Jenkins' No Way This Guy Is Innocent DA to Rosamund Pike's Painfully Naive Defense Attorney (not to mention the two-for-one cliche of Clashing Father/Daughter Attorneys With Opposing Values). Michael Raymond-James (best known as the Cajun bad guy from the first season of True Blood) is Linsky, the Lurking Henchman Who Screws Up And Pisses Off The Boss.  Alexia Fast's Sandy is Girl Who Dies Because She's Too Dumb To Listen To The Hero. Joseph Sikora's Barr is the Victim You're Not Meant To Sympathize With.  And Robert Duvall's ex-marine shooting range owner, Cash, is just another in a string of recent roles which Duvall seems to be making a career of these days, The Tough But Affable Old Coot.<br /><br />The only truly redeeming things in Jack Reacher are a handful of scenes which are genuinely funny (as opposed to the scenes which are - unfortunately for the film - unintentionally funny) and a surprise - and superb - performance by famed German film director Werner Herzog.  In one scene, Reacher is assaulted by three thugs while he's searching an apartment... but he barely has to do anything because the thugs are so physically incompetent that they land more blows on each other than even come close to hitting him.  Reacher doesn't even really have to dodge.  It's a brilliant bit of masterfully choreographed comic violence that comes across as completely believable instead of mere slapstick.  In another scene, Reacher ends up in a situational joke - finding himself in the role of being the guy who brought a knife to a gun fight - which is then taken another comical step further.  And Herzog's villain, The Zec (Russian for \\"The Prisoner\\") is a truly chilling creation, a ruthlessly self-controlled villain with only one good eye who never raises his voice... because he never has to.  Especially after he explains why he's missing so many pieces of his fingers.  He only has a handful of scenes, but he's far and away the most memorable thing in the film.  And for fans of the author, Lee Childs has a cameo as the desk sergeant in a scene at a police station.<br /><br />The bulk of the blame for Jack Reacher's failure to rise above the mediocre should, I think, be laid in equal parts on McQuarrie as the writer & director and on Cruise as the producer.  McQuarrie struck gold - once - back in 1995 when he did the screenplay for the iconic The Usual Suspects, for which he was properly awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.  Since then however, his record has been decidedly spotty.  Prior to Jack Reacher, McQuarrie's only directorial effort at a feature film was the 2000 box-office bomb The Way Of The Gun, for which he also wrote the screenplay.  Many of the same problems with that film are repeated here, including a ham-handedly manipulative score by Joe Kraemer surrounding what one critic termed \\"a pointless exercise in gun violence with characterizations so thin they vaporize\\".<br /><br />But then Cruise, as the producer, must be held accountable, not only for picking McQuarrie to write and direct and for picking Kraemer to do the film score, but also for casting himself as Reacher.  Not only is Cruise not remotely physically suited for the role (Reacher is 6'5\\" and built like a tank; Cruise is 5'7\\" and weighs about 170 lbs), his performance just walks all over the character Child created (Jack Reacher is noted for not saying anything most of the time; Cruise's Reacher won't shut up).  One way of looking at this film is that it's Cruise working his way through some mid-life crisis, trying to show that at 50 he's still physically the same actor he was back in his 20's when he did Top Gun.  Which is why the publicity for the movie is making such a big deal about Cruise doing his own stunts and why there are these scenes lingering on Cruise's bare upper torso when he takes his shirt off.  Don't get me wrong - as an actor, Cruise can deliver excellent work as he's done in films as varied as Tropic Thunder, Collateral, Jerry Maguire and Interview With The Vampire - but only when he's under a director that he can't walk all over as he does McQuarrie in this film.  Here, he spends most of his time going through stage-managed fight and chase scenes with one facial expression that only varies with the intensity of the glare.<br /><br />Except for Werner Herzog's chilling bad guy and a couple of fairly original funny scenes, not really recommended unless you've got two-plus hours to burn and don't mind spending it on a film barely distinguishable from the hundred or more films you've already seen that are just like it.  Again, it's not really bad - it's just sort of there.s missing so many pieces of his fingers.  He only has a handful of scenes, but he's far and away the most memorable thing in the film.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack, and only give it a 4 stat because I wish it had a few more songs. Great for people that saw and enjoyed the film. Worth the money to relive the magic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've learned not to underestimate people. Especially authors. Especially authors that I love. Especially Colleen Hoover. Even going into Hopeless and knowing I was going to love it (come on, it's Colleen Hoover!); I was still completely and utterly obsessed with and lost in Sky's story. Jaw droppingly impressed with this one. I more than lusted it, I more than lived it, I loved it. And, then I cried. There were plenty of moments where I laughed too though, but really, I cried, a lot.<br /><br />Going into Hopeless I didn't know what I was getting into, but I didn't think it would be this. I didn't think I would become so immersed in the story that I would all out plead for things to change. I was thrown with this plot, I sank down on my knees at one point and just stared. I WILL NOT spoil anything. I will not drone on. And, I will definitely not ruin any bit of this book for you. The shock of the story as it unfolds makes it unforgettable. This woman is good, really good, Colleen Hoover is a great. I WILL say that it is phenomenal, it is heart melting, it is horrible, it is emotional, it is gorgeous, and I am still a mess (days after finishing it) just recalling what I loved about it.<br /><br />Hopeless is told from Sky's POV and set up like diary entries. Every now and then the reader gets to glimpse at her past. Sky was adopted at a very young age and doesn't really have any memories from her life before. So, peeking at her memories really added a secretive element to the book.<br /><br />The love story in Hopeless is epic. E-P-I-C. It is even better than Layken and Will's story (I know, I'm serious though). Sky has lived her life unable to feel a connection to boys, until she meets Holder. Holder is someone that Sky knows she should stay away from but can't help being interested in what he could and does make her feel. As their relationship grows a lot changes in their lives, lives that will never be the same.<br /><br />If you want to be floored by a book and become so involved in the story that the outside world melts away; Hopeless is one of the best reads out there. It is one emotional disaster and I loved it with all of my broken heart. So read it. Read Slammed. Love Point of Retreat. And stalk Colleen, like I am, for news on any upcoming books!<br /><br />I purchased a copy of this book from another retailer.ecome so involved in the story that the outside world melts away; Hopeless is one of the best reads out there.

B004SIP7F8|2.0|\\"The English Patient\\" (1998) Visits The Pre-WWII British Empire Which Was Obviously Very Attractive In Many Ways.<br />-------------<br /><br />Some movies not wonderful in important ways are still worth seeing due to the \\"side show\\" part of them which includes travel to and depiction of interesting places and people.<br /><br />\\"The English Patient\\" (1998) is such a movie.....the main part is a soap-opera tear-jerker movie presenting sad results of forbidden romance and terrible outcomes for the main characters (the lovers....both boy and girl.... get karmic, wrath of God vengience for committing adultery and not paying close enough disciplined attention to supporting the victors of WWII....he gets his face burned off and becomes a terminal burn case ....not just his face...and she ends up dying alone in a dark, cold cave in the middle of the Sahara desert waiting for her lover to rescue her, but waiting in vain).<br /><br />Obey the 10 Commandments (esp. the one about adultery, and not committing it!), and be patriotic, guys and girls.....and this won't happen to you!<br /><br />Well........about 80% of \\"The English Patient\\" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame.<br /><br />However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012).<br /><br />I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that \\"every cloud has a silver lining\\" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like \\"The English Patient\\" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show \\"counterpoint\\" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie.<br /><br />Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good.  The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the \\"good life\\" from England.<br /><br />All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples.<br /><br />The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it.<br /><br />Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantasic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England.<br /><br />Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out.  Prices were cheap, and good times were many.<br /><br />This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials.<br /><br />\\"The English Patient\\" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people).<br /><br />The good times are over, but \\"The English Patient\\" (1998) provides an important \\"homage\\" to it all.........afternoon tea dances,  well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world.<br /><br />Nice work if you can get it!<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor.<br /><br />See \\"profile\\" (hit the icon for it) this website provides abut me for details, links to other sites about me.,  well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world.<br /><br />Nice work if you can get it!<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor.<br /><br />See \\"profile\\" (hit the icon for it) this website provides abut me for details, links to other sites about me.
0062082353|4.0|I liked this book.  It is a decent autobiography and has some great stories.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed Taya's contribution.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|I appreciate this Blu-ray Dvd more than I appreciated just listening to the cd.  It is hard to see how much of his singing voice he has lost; of course, he is 70 yrs old now 3 yrs older than me.  I don't know if he should really be singing anymore; but it must be hard to give it up it has been his whole life. As someone who is just a few years younger; this watching yourself age is certainly not easy because no matter how old your body gets you will always feel younger inside.<br />I have been a Paul McCartney fan since the first time I heard him as part of the Beatles when they came to the U.S. in 1964.<br />I was a loyal fan of Wings. When Linda McCartney died; I still followed his music on his own. I even have Linda McCartney's solo album which was released after her death which was a labor of love for Paul.<br />Thank you Amazon for selling this special Blu-ray Dvd of Paul McCartney's latest music.<br />I forgot to mention how much I love that sweet Valentine song that Paul McCartney wrote for his new wife; it is very sweet and touching.  Any woman would be proud to have such a sweet song written about her; and also sung to her with so much love.<br />Way to go Paul :-) :-)
0142405809|5.0|Loved the prose and illustrations -- so fun to read aloud to my boys.  The story also has a nice life lesson about never being to small to help a friend.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|THIS WAS GIVING TO A FAMILY MEMBER WHO LOVES THE SHOW - WALKING DEAD. THEY ALSO WANTED THE 2 ND SEASON, SO I ORDERED THAT ONE AS WELL
0345803485|2.0|I got this book from a colleague that dropped it on my lap. Every single woman at work had read it and apparently it changed their marriages. They were all going nuts. I never had any interest in this story, but since it was right there in front of me, i just shrugged and said \\"What the hell, let's give it a try!\\". I wish I had kept my distance. Let's talk about the characters, shall we?<br /><br />Christian Grey is a sick, sick man. The controlling side of his personality makes my skin crawl and bothers me the most. Oh. my. God. He wants to know where she is all the time, he wants to control what and when she eats, he wants to choose what she's going to wear, he schedules an appointment with an OB/GYN for her (disturbing), she can't even roll her eyes for pete's sake!!!! That's not hot, that's just creepy! She fails to respond to one e-mail and the man shows up at her door. She travels to stay away from him for a few days, but he won't let that happen, would he? There he is 'surprising' her. Grrrrrrr. Get the hell away, you weirdo! I actually screamed and punched my pillow when he didn't get his way with her under the dinner table at his parents' house and decided that he had to punish her. And she actually accepted to be treated that way. What an idiot!<br />Christian COULD be a very interesting character if the author bothered to explore his issues a bit more. I wanted depth. I think Bernard Cornwell and J.R.R. Tolkien have ruined me for lesser books. Christian is very sexy and i'm sure the guy is a good laid, but i wouldn't be able to stand this spoiled brat. \\"I need to be in control\\". Boo-hoo. Get over yourself.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele. This one i can describe with a single word: childish. Woman, for the love of God, have some self respect! She can't play the game at all. She's constantly having the same doubts throughout the entire book. The man doesn't like to be touched and she insists to bring it up every single time. So annoying...She got spanked twice, left him in the end, but couldn't spend five days away from him? Argh...They really deserve each other.<br /><br />The book is poorly written. There's no variation of vocabularies and scenarios. She's always dazzled by his looks, he's always perfect and everybody else around him wants to screw his brains out. Oh, and every time they meet, they have sex and it's mind blowing...until he starts to spank her for rolling her eyes or biting her lip. Right....that's realistic.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed and i wanted the scenes in the red room to be way more intense.<br /><br />I wanted to know more about his relationship with Elena. THAT would be a good story to read.
B003QSEYQY|5.0|You would get more reviews if you didn't require the participants to write so much x x x x x x
B009NQKPUW|2.0|In this prequel to Alien, Ridley Scott showed very little imagination, and poorly utilized the actors. He even messed up a number of continuity items from scene to scene and between this movie and Alien.  The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is that the visual effects were done well.<br />To anyone who really liked Alien (one of my all-time favorites), skip Prometheus.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show is just amazing and the dvds with backstages and extras are so good. I watch them over and over again.
0142407542|5.0|This second installment of the Gruffalo story did not disappoint.  Same beautiful rhyming prose and gorgeous illustrations and a nice twist on the power of one's imagination.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I wanted to see this so bad when it came out in theaters and never made it out to go see it. My brother got this for me for my birthday and I never ask for or buy movies before I've seen them before. I am so happy I just asked for this and got it. It is so good and I've probably watched it 15 times so far. I get all the songs stuck in my head too so now I'll have to buy the soundtrack. Definitely worth the watch.
B00000DWG6|5.0|This particular product's listed UPC is for the 1990 edition of The Who, Live at Leeds CD. That version only had the same 6 tracks as the original album. The 14 track version was not available until 1995 and is also listed on Amazon. Both are very good albums, but be aware of what you are buying!<br /><br />The concert was great though there were feedback problems during some of the songs. The original 6 songs, \\"Young Man Blues\\", \\"Substitute\\", \\"Summertime Blues\\", \\"Shakin' All Over\\", \\"My Generation\\" & \\"The Magic Bus\\" were the highlights of the set.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids and I all love this movie!!! This is one I could watch over and over!!! Great movie for the family!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was not what I was expecting and though I felt it stereotyped a lot, I still loved the book. I couldn't stop reading because I couldn't help but feel it was talking to me. GREAT BOOK!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is just amazing and the dvds with backstages and extras are so good. I watch them over and over again.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Was curious how they would pad the story to make video.  Nice addition of the momma squirrel (Helena Bonham Carter) narrating the story to her children.  The score is lush, the animation is gorgeous and true to the book illustrations and Bonham Carter's narration is appropriately lilting.
B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|I Enjoyed the smooth sounds - great background music.  Perfect for our age/generation or older. A must-have for JT fans!
1401307787|4.0|A sensible book with clear instructions on how to efficiently manage agitation and all kinds of uncomfortable emotions.  Nothing magical, just stick to the ribs coaching on managing one's own moods.
1846551455|5.0|It is good to finally get the story that started Harry Hole's career. I hope Jo Nesbo continues the story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an action packed book and  can't wait to read the third book. I would recommend it for people who like action,adventure and romance.

1439152802|5.0|I purchased this item for my mother. She has already finished reading it. She said the book was well-made. The pages are made of quality paper with no pages sticking together, the spine is sturdy and the jacket is in perfect condition. She was very pleased.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was way better than I could have imagined! In my opinion the beginning started off a little slow, but it slowly turned into an amazing read. I'd recommend this book to anybody who wants a thrill and loves the unexpected.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This has so many different version of the bible, that you should fine one that you like it is also good for people that have trouble reading it will read to you.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|Lightweight and durable cover makes carrying my Kindle Fire with me more comfortable. Easy to prop open for hands free reading. Plan to us it for a long time.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|i order this in adivce and i love it! but i was alittle upset that\\" do you hear the people sing\\" wasn't on the cd. i mean it's ahuge number in the play, but they put in 'suddnly\\"? so now i have to look on youtube for it. but other then that the music was beautiful, very boradway style of singing.  Anne hathaway was amazng same with Huge jackmen! the movie was just as good,more so beacasue you can see the feeling and not just hear it.

B000088E6D|4.0|I bought this buble CD for my uncle too. He was so happy because he broke his old one. Another great purchase!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much but each time I got engrossed in the story the author spoiled it with excessive profanity that didn't fit the character. Except for this I would have given this book five stars. If you are blind to profanity this is a great HSF book to read.
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|Ordered this for my fiance's aging Macbook Pro.  Works fantastic right out of the package with no surprises or hiccups.
B0071MV540|3.0|Humorous in parts, boring in others, but if you happen to be stuck on a flight with absolutely nothing else to do, then I guess it is watchable.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I bought and read this download on my Kindle.  Some time later, someone gave me the actual book, which I re-read.  It was somewhat easier to figure out when the story switched points of view when reading the actual book than when I read the Kindle version.
B007N85POS|4.0|have a fun time playing this game.  follows very closely to the good old angry birds fashion.<br />this distance on some of the screens could be improved upon
B000BFH2S2|4.0|Bought as a Christmas present for my Uncle. He is a huge buble fan and he was so happy with this cd/dvd combo.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones is about a forensic anthropologist and an FBI agent who team up to solve crimes with the help of the &#34;squints&#34; or other forensic scientists, all of whom have very close and invincible friendships. I only recently began watching Bones and was intrigued from the very beginning. The episodes are always different and equally funny, interesting, and suspenseful. This show is for teenagers and adults, ages 15 and up. It is for the most part clean, but it does have the occasional swear word and in the later seasons, as the characters become more romantically involved, contains quite a bit of talk and sometimes showing of kissing and sensual activity. Other than that, it is a very good tv show and the lead characters Seeley Booth and Dr. Temperance Brennan have a witty relationship that is enjoyable to follow. One last note; in addition to the content described earlier, there are many good and noble qualities portrayed and just duties performed in the show. For example, Booth is a devoted Catholic who has, except for the occasional wrong doing, very good morals and tries to lead the other characters to do the right thing. Overall, I think that if you can distinguish the mistakes from the good in the show, then you will enjoy it immensly. I highly recommend it if you like crime dramas.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I genuinely enjoyed this book because it was definitely different. The plot was interesting, the characters were dynamic and the scene was captivating. The only thing I struggled through was some of the extra detail and the first part was a little too fragmented. Past that, the book held my attention all the way through. I'm kinda hoping the author writes another book to clear up some remaining questions I have!:) Good book!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Don't waste your time or money. This movie is terrible. Bad acting, unbelievably un-humorous & a horribly written story line. I could only take about 20 minutes of this movie before wanting to poke my eyes out with a fully heated curling iron.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Loved the book. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the rest. I'm hoping the movie is just as good
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I use it to keep in touch with family and friends, but it is very unstable and has too many quirks for it to be dependable
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Got this cd for my uncle also. He was very happy and listens to it often. Real cd's have better quality sound than mp3's because each song is about 10 times larger file wav. vs mp3. My uncle recommends this cd.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I am a musician but do not own a piano. I went searching for an app that would suffice for finding the pitch of certain notes. I found this app useful because I do not play piano and there are settings which show the note names which each key stands for. I also like to just sit and mess around with it occasionally. It has songs that it will teach you how to play and many other helpful settings.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is so much fun! Every game is so so so so so so so so so cool! Love it!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Terrible interface with a huge hole in available apps, Amazon takes full advantage of Android & its open source contributors, without giving back. Meanwhile iOS gets native VOD & better tablet support while Amazon states that Android is not capable of utilizing VOD at this time, which is funny since hardly a hairs width seperates a Kindle Fire from any other Android tablet.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Enjoy playing with this game everyday.  I would reccommend this game to anyone. It's easy enough, even my grandson loves it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This game is a pretty cool but it is a demo so it only gives you like 15-20 min so you don't get much time. Don't give it more than 3-4 stars.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|This film, based on the life of Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman Michael Oher, is populated by strong, well-acted characters. The football scenes are reasonably believable, as are the interactions between Mr. Oher and his adoptive family. The movie nicely displays the development of trust and love between the characters, and the script provides Ms. Bullock an opportunity to portray one of the strongest &#34;southern lady&#34; parts in film.<br /><br />A feel-good family film.
0393088731|4.0|Another fun read from Mr. Welsh. I gave it four stars cause it rocks. The author def knows his material - one of the quotes on heroin use sums it up (&#34;...c**ts that try and psychoanalyse the f***ed-up miss the crucial point: sometimes ye just dae it cause it's thaire n that's wey ye are.&#34;) (pg 179)<br />This book (and his others) are so great because they show us how things were at a specific place (Leith & Edinburgh Scotland) and a specific time and involving a certain group of people. As simple as this sounds, it works wonderfully when mixed with Welsh's use of Scottish slang.<br />Bottom line - if you liked Trainspotting and Welsh's other novels, you'll love this as well.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Outstanding read! I could not put it down one I had read the first page.  I will definitely want to read more Kate Norton now!
B004J64QSI|5.0|Alfie Boe has the purest tenor voice I've ever heard.  Recently saw the 2012 Les Miserables movie and would rather view this 25th anniversary production.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are filled with love, hate, and revenge. It will keep you on your toes. It will make you laugh, cry, and want to find a loved one and hold them tight. It will, in some way, change your life. Although fiction, it will show you reasons to be grateful.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|first time i read a book like this! i hope you some film producer will make this book to  movie! that would be an awesome movie!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon give strong, memorable performances in this film directed by Clint Eastwood. Mr. Freeman is said to have been Nelson Mandela's choice to play the part of the first black South African President, striving to create a unified nation in the face of opposition from both black and white citizens.<br /><br />The strong supporting cast and attention to realism make for an authentic and enjoyable film which closely follows the events chronicled by John Carlin in his book &#34;Playing The Enemy&#34;.<br /><br />The rugby scenes are well-choreographed and believable, and the film grabs your attention from first to last.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy playing mahjong so I downloaded this game.  I like it<br />Its easy to play and i can take it anywhere with me
0786838655|3.0|So I kept comparing this book to the Harry Potter series, as I'm sure many of us would do.. but I think that isn't fair.<br /><br />This book is fresh and fun in its own way, and I do plan to finish the other 4 books in the series as well at some point.<br /><br />If you're looking for a relaxed, chilled fantasy read which is not very intense, its a great pick.<br /><br />Kids would love it.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Save your money. Cld of been a lot more funny. Pretty gross at times wld not recommend. At times very stupid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very good book. I would recommend this book to many people. I love this book. Very good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very helpful this app helped bring me closer to the Lord almighty. I believe in the Lord the holy Catholic church and everything in between. AMEN :) &lt;3
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AMAZING<br />  The first place for the world to be ignored while you escape in the mystifying fantasy of the other worldly experience
B008IJTFYW|2.0|It didnt; really do anything for me.  The sounds are not very loud.  They are also not very long.  I would like to listen longer
0553386794|5.0|It took me a good 30 mins of staring at the books before I actually decided to venture into the series..<br /><br />I have not watched the tv show, simply because I knew at some point I was gonna get around to reading them.. cause everyone insists its an incredible series, and I completely agree.<br /><br />The only thing I would say to potential readers, is the following:<br /><br />A) It is a formidable read, the series.<br /><br />B) You would need to refer to the appendix at the back of the book every now and again to keep track of the myriad characters you need following in the book, but it gets easier midway through the book.<br /><br /> C) The way to prepare yourself for this book is to think of it as a journey and a long adventure you are embarking upon.. to just enjoy it for what is presents.. and you will not be disappointed. Guaranteed. Beast of a book.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautifully-written, witty, ingenious novel. This is not your average \\"cancer book.\\" It is so much more than that. It's about life, love, suffering, consciousness. I have no more words. Just read the book. It is flawless.

0399159029|4.0|Bernie Gunther is quite the character...not very happy in Berlin where he is currently living and working. He gets assigned to work for a man he despises, Reinhard Heydrich as his bodyguard. trouble follows and Bernie must untangle himself and others from Heydrich and try and find a way to live with himself in this new Germany...<br /> The way Philip talks about Germany makes you feel as though you are right there with him, he gives Bernie language unlike any I have ever read before...perfect for the time period.<br /> I came into this series on the 8th Bernie Gunther book, I typicaly try to read a series in order but having said that I don't feel like I lost anything. I think I was able to understand the book with out having read the previous ones.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best TV series ever, and Amazon prime makes it so easy! From now on we are going to buy all movies and shows on Amazon!
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is the most action packed movie that I have seen in a very long time!The picture and audio were perfection!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I haven't been playing this very long, but so far I really like it!  The main puzzle is challenging but not overly so for casual gaming. Then there are a couple of other little tasks you need to do in the game, which makes for a nice break between rounds. I also haven't experienced any problems on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was an easy read and enjoyable. Not over the top x rated but just enough for interest to keep you reading
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Takes me back to playing the original on that old Apple. This is so much better though. Wondering how I can get my family to work the farm too
B004I744AS|4.0|I purchased this App to have a Dictionary on my kindle.  It is a good dictionary for use while emailing or just spelling checks.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|This has always been my favorite gang movie since i seen it brand new when it was first released!The action is incredible and the soundtrack superb and the picture and audio as clear as a DVD!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|What other way can you judge a book other than its ability to keep you reading. Couldn't escape the clutches of this book until it was finished. Cannot wait to finish the series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks.  This is a wonderful story of starting over and realizing that you're worthy of love.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This was another awesome Sylvester Stallone movie! I haven't got the chance to see the second one yet, but I hope it's as good as this one! This movie was full of laughs, but had a story too, it wasn't just meaningless humor. It's always refreshing to watch a movie that can be both funny and serious at the same time.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I purchased this app to set up sells for eBay use.  Quite a nece program and easy to use.  If you are a reseller or just need to sell something on eBay this is the app for you.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Highly recommended for any batman fan your greeted with a full art work batman logo on the back ......a must have .
B004XJHBCE|1.0|Doesn't appear to work on a Kindle Fire HD.  If it does I couldn't find any support for Kindle issues on their site.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|This app works no better than the free ones for the kindle hd; it's not worth your 99 cents. I have the iPhone version of Genius/Doc Scan and it's incomparably better.<br /><br />In this app, there's only 2 \\"enhancements\\" color and black and white. The crop feature only allows rectangular shapes. There are no other finer adjustments for contrast or brighten like those found in the iPhone app made by the same group.<br /><br />Considering that the kindle hd's camera is only 1.3 mpx, a good scanning app is sorely needed, but unfortunately unavailable.
1558908846|5.0|This is obviously not the first time I've seen the movie. I don't just buy old movies, without knowing what they are. My husband is a big Stallone fan, so this was the perfect Christmas gift for him! It's a really great story, and I would definitely suggest this movie to family and friends!
B000000OU0|3.0|I own most of the Eagles Music of years past and this is a good example of their music, having come back together after a long Haiteus from working together.  They play their old hits and some more stuff they have come up with to keep it interesting for them.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Very interresting from start to finish.  Honesty concerning his entire life with of course, a comedian's flair.  Highly recommend for anyone.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Enjoyed it. Would recommend this for all ages. Used as a prize in a Christmas game, & it was highly coveted.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED this book. Especially after all of the generic YA books I've been reading. And although I liked Hoover's Slammed books, they do not even compare to this one.<br /><br />Although I loved EVERY PART of this book I want to talk about how perfect the last chapter was to me. I don't wanna spoil anything and I don't think I am considering the table of contents reveals that the final chapter is a flashback from the date. This is one of the things that had kept me from jumping into this book. I've been having a problem with unsatisfactory endings because I'm always hoping for an epilogue where I can see the characters after the events of the book in a piece of their happily ever after. A flashback is definitely the opposite of my desired epilogue. I was thrown off by the date of the last chapter thinking that something bad might happen in the book and it wouldn't be resolved so Hoover ended it with a flashback. This was so not the case.<br /><br />The flashback was the perfect way to end this book. It was beautiful and tied the whole story together somehow in my heart. The flashback made it seem to me that the whole book was the epilogue. It made me think that I was given a whole book to read of the future of that last chapter instead of a measly chapter that I might've gotten of the future of the whole book if Hoover had chosen to write an epilogue instead. In my mind, I feel that the whole story in romance books is what is leading to the happily ever after, but this flashback made me feel like this whole book was the happily ever after. Their happily ever after was definitely not perfectly happy at times but it was beautiful and real which made this whole story feel alive.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Checked other reviews and they were positive. Sometimes sequels don't measure up, but this was not disappointing for a sequel!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I added this Alarm to my Kindle, to provide an alarm clock function to my reader.  I recommend this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|love it. So intense and interesting. I love the books. Can't stop<br />reading. Katniss is awesome. Can't wait to read the next book.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|The picture is more than good. BTW you get a DIGITAL version of it. I can't think of a reason to give it anything but a five star
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Well written, good story. Well written story. It will have readers searching to see if the story is at all factual.
B0012250IM|5.0|We love the movie & the soundtrack! They are magical & have both become a Christmas tradition for our family.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|cannot figure it out children are disappointed.  The directions are weak and it is so complicated even the kids cannot figure it out

B0087ZG7GQ|4.0|The picture is pretty clear. And the movie itself, is more than perfect.<br />The product is great. So far I haven't found any defects.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really fascinating and fast paced I enjoyed the total game with lots of frighteningly moments that made me jump a little I couldn't put it down
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is great, easy to use & I much prefer the search function on the app to the one that I can use on the computer.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|This is a great game.  You can get it very easily and have fun as it challenges you more and more.  Good for all ages. Its addicting.
B0090O07RS|4.0|Sound quality suffers. Concert is only about an hour long. Good music but much better sound from CD's.There are better Doors DVD's out there.
B004CURZFC|5.0|My son read the book and then wanted the movie.  He said the book was better (aren't they all) but watched it twice in two days!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was immediately drawn into \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I love starting a book and feeling the characters right away. I'm off to find Book 2 and the movie. It will be interesting to compare the two.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|We all love this story & the movie has become a Christmas tradition for our family...this year, we watched it 4 times. Our son (just turned 5) also likes to watch it in the Spring/Summer, too.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|the angry birds are great in any situation seasons has great backrounds and the pigs have tried to barricate themselves very well<br />it fun to smash them down and i dont mind the small ads in the upper corner of the game
B000VHMF0A|5.0|A fantastic collection, great value.  This collection is well curated and the sound quality is surprisingly high end for an MP3 of recordings made many years ago.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I was not a follower of these movies until the last one was set to come out. I saw the preview and just had to know what it was about.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|This book gives a very narrow view of love. There are many more languages to love than five. Hold up wait a minute let's put some God's word in it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a really good mind game that I enjoy almost every day. It is important exercise and enjoyable<br />Jim taylor,husband
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Loved the story. Keeps you glued to the pages chapter after chapter. I can't wait to read the rest of the books.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Its funny, but its def adult humor. We certainly laughed (out loud) but in a few places the bear crossed the line. Ha
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was the sweetest love story ever. I really like this movie. It was interesting to watch their love unfold.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Everytime I buy coins or credits they show up then disappear but im losing my money off my card how do I get a refund
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is fun.. a little drawn out after a couple of levels. Maybe good or younger children. Nice graphics.
B000FVE3A2|4.0|I recently received my Invicta 3044 watch. I am very pleased with my purchase. I haven't owned it long enough to speak of it's durability. It is a great looking watch. I'm hoping with average use, it still looks and performs great for years to come..
B009ERK1T0|4.0|With their being well over a decade into their career, you might wonder if the Deftones can still surprise you with an album. Ever since their game-changing masterpiece White Pony, which transformed a lot of people's ideas about what alt-metal could be, the band has released a succession of albums that use White Pony's formulas as a foundation. They still explored new sounds, but they were unmistakably the Deftones.<br /><br />Koi No Yokan is still unmistakably the Deftones, which is perfectly fine for fans. It opens with &#34;Swerve City,&#34; which features Chino Moreno's voice soaring melodically over slamming guitar riffs. Sound familiar? it should, but it also sounds pretty awesome. And as the album continues, the 'Tones show they still have a few tricks up their sleeves. &#34;Romantic Dreams&#34; is downright prog, with the band changing time signatures three times during the course of the song. Tempest is a six-minute sonic minor-key opus. &#34;What Happened to You?&#34; is very unlike the rest of the album, with Abe Cunningham inventing a new skittering drum pattern to prop up a jazzy bass line and light, ethereal guitar from Stef Carpenter.<br /><br />In short, the Deftones won't exactly drop any jaws with this album, but considering how many bands cannot survive as along as they have, both the band an the listener can be satisfied with what they're offering.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is a good movie and definitely not your kids Snow White. It has good suspense and acting. It is great that it came with a digital copy so I can watch on my ipad.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|So I didn't think that I would like this app. But it's not that bad the pros- free, didn't make u think to hard ,and its free .cons- you know when the coin gets to the edge and it won't fall down into your collection in real life it does the same thing @$&amp;! Poop . Plays well on kindle fire hd
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This is the perfect movie for Blu-Ray technology. A classic action movie coupled with Blu-Ray enhanced picture and sound is a combination that can't be beat!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|One of the best books ever I just love the entire wimpy kid series Jeff Kinney is so funny !
B009AMANBA|2.0|If Quentin Tarantino's \\"Django Unchained\\" represents pure cinema, Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" (2012) represents anti-cinema: static, dialogue-heavy and devoid of visual poetry. This well-intentioned but hopelessly boring history lesson could have been directed by anyone, including Spielberg. By focusing almost exclusively on the passage of the 13th Amendment, screenwriter Tony Kushner places Daniel Day-Lewis' detailed performance in a straitjacket - thus limiting the actor's dramatic range. Unfortunately, we are saddled with an Abraham Lincoln who loves to hear himself talk . . . and talk. Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field and James Spader lend some much-needed spark to a lifeless film. The 150-minute running time feels longer than January 1865. Spielberg's dreariest work - topped off by another intrusive John Williams score.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An amazing story, extremely well written.  I would love to see the movie that accompanies this book.  Worth every star given
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Very good book, very funny too!  My favorite Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, looking forward to reading the Third Wheel
B00993FEUK|1.0|This movie is so bad, no person of any age should have to watch it.<br /><br />Norman talks with the slur of a coward/ wimp that never seems to gain confidence as the movie progresses. Even if you didn't expect it to, it's plain annoying and hard to understand.<br /><br />Horrid voice acting aside, the dialogue is so stupid that it's mind numbingly painful. **spoiler** Norman says he's the only one that should talk to the witch for the first hour of the movie and when he gets to her, he doesn't know what to say. He sputters some crap about them being similar (without ever mentioning what... being able to talk to ghosts i know) and the witch responds that their different because he's a guy. I mean this scene is supposed to be the climax. Instead they utter nonsense.<br /><br />The jock is supposed to be a moron, not a vegetable. You can't have a character that doesn't embody any stereotypes. The fat kids jock brother literally IS less intelligent than the zombies in this movie.<br /><br />The movie has no moral. The witch was killed and Norman tells her that it's not cool to hurt other people. 300 years later of a curse later, she suddenly realizes this and goes to heaven happy... Where's the revelation, puzzle solving, or heart warming speech that satisfies the viewers??<br /><br />Literally, you need to fill in the blanks for yourself because the movie never explains itself.<br /><br />Also, the other reviews are right to say there are a ton of sexual innuendos. Many of which belong in Family Guy or Adult Swim.<br /><br />The only plus is... the animation team is top notch. God like! Visual orgasm ruined by stupid dialogue and an overall terrible story that doesn't develop much.
B009GESJH2|5.0|If your a fan of kid rock you wil want this cd all the tracks are great. I bought this cheaper than in stores. this is a must have for kid rock fans!
B009DT424Y|5.0|Good product, EXCELLENT cust service.<br />Got the microphone, it wouldn't pair with any of my apple devices.<br />Did something I never do, and called custsvc phone number.<br />Got an answer on 2nd ring, and a resolution within a few minutes.<br />He also offered to immediately send me a replacement, if necessary.<br />Extremely surprised with the personal quality of the support from this vendor/manufacturer.<br />I was trying to use the bluetooth mic to record remotely onto an iphone.<br />If it doesn't work with your idevices, contact support, they will provide the following instructions:<br /><br />&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;BEGIN EMAIL FROM NOLAN SYSTEMS SUPPORT&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;<br /><br />It is nice to talk with you.  Looks like your Bluetooth MIC with latest firmware which support both audio reciver and iphone/ipad mode.<br /><br />The new MIC support 2 different mode, one is to pair audio receiver which same as before and another mode is to pair with iPhone/iPad..etc. So, you need to  ensure the MIC is enter iPhone/iPad mode first. Then, you can start to pair with iPhone/iPad after in iPone/iPad mode.<br /><br />The procedure is very simple.<br />You need to press and hold the ON/OFF button on MIC until Blue and Amber LED blinking alternatively. Then, the MIC is on and in pairing mode for iPhone/iPad.<br /><br />Please keep in mind. the LED light will be Blue and Amber alternatively is ready pairing at iPhone/iPad mode.<br /><br />If you see the Blue LED quick flash only, it is the normal mode for audio receiver. It can not pair with iPhone/iPad.<br /><br />You can press and hold the ON/OFF button for mode change btw audio receiver mode (quick blue flash) and iphone/iPad mode (blue and amber led flash alternatively).<br /><br />Oh, one thing to remind you that if you like to do the voice recoding on iphone/ipad, you may need to use the apps which support Bluetooth MIC. You can find related apps on apps store such as &#34;audio memos pro&#34;, US$0.99. The default apps such as voice memos and video recording on iPhone/iPad only use their own internal MIC.. Hope this information is good for your, too<br /><br />If you still have question to pair, pls feel free to contact me.  We are glad to help you on this.<br /><br />Best wish you have a wonderful and happy new year!!

B00933JF74|4.0|Fun game to twiddle the time away in between the important things.  It's kinda addictive.  Wish it had better directions.  I've been playing it for a few days and still don't understand a couple of things that weren't shown in the demo and can't find a help menu.  Cool game, though, overall.
B0063M22QO|5.0|lots of fun.  great for grade school kids.  good way to rocognize and associate the differences to match the tiles.

B000AOEMXM|4.0|Purchased use I enjoyed the whole series.  One disk had problems when it played but all the rest worked fine.
B000000QFV|1.0|Let me start this off by first saying I'm NOT one of those guys who completely dismiss any Sabbath albums that don't have anything to do with Ozzy or Dio.  After growing up and hearing the Ozzy/Dio stuff, I wanted to try out all the \\"other\\" Sabbath albums I missed out on; namely, the Tony Martin era.  I first listened to Forbidden and Cross Purposes, which I actually LOVED.  Both those albums are really, REALLY good.  Then I got the live Cross Purposes album, and that was great as well.  SO, after hearing Tony Martin and liking three of his Sabbath-era albums, I decided to pick up Tyr and The Eternal Idol.<br /><br />Now, at least with Forbidden and Cross Purposes, they SOUNDED like Sabbath albums.  Maybe some people didn't like them, and that's fine...but at least those albums sounded like Sabbath.<br /><br />Tyr DOESN'T.  It's not that it's BAD, or that Tony Martin sounds bad.  It's just that this doesn't sound like a Black Sabbath album at all.  I tried to listen to it, I really did.  But after only a couple listens, I deleted it from my collection and have no desire to hear this garbage again.  ADVICE:  For those interested in non-Ozzy/non-Dio Sabbath, I HIGHLY recommend both Forbidden AND Cross Purposes.  Those are EXCELLENT albums.<br /><br />But NOT Tyr!!!<br /><br />AVOID!

B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book and I enjoyed the witty sarcasm within it. Is there going to be a second book? I felt there wasn't much of an ending.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I think it is a good book and a good dictionary<br />It is also a good way to learn English<br />The book is fantastic

B008JGSM6G|5.0|enjoyable game that is ever changing. like that it uses strategy, not just speed or luck.easy on the eyes too. fun.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My son loves this game and got me addicted as well. It is a lot of fun but you need to continuously play. One problem already mentioned is you cannot find your online friends so my son and I cannot visit each other.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoy all of Jeff's books I would recommended it to people who want a humorous read ,rock on Kinney and I hope you make more books! :)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series!!! I have read all of them and this book is probably my favorite!!! The dance was funny because everything went good for Rowley and terrible for Greg!!! I love the books and I hope that he keeps making more books and movies!!! It was hilarious and funny!!! You have my approval to get the book!!!!

B009MCRHH6|5.0|thanks for the suggestions for physics. the simple physics were not clear to me before.  this kind of campaign was ultimate . there are building and also obvious messages for people with power speed leveling Ocd . these levels are all good. they are improved and all make sense.
B000QGAU4E|3.0|This is the second download I have tried with you guys and the downloading process is terrible. I spent over an hour trying to get it downloaded still I have not been able to finish watching it. Also i was charged three times for the single download of this film, what gives? I'm very disappointed with the downloading process. This is not like you guys to provide this level of poor quality service. Please advise. thanks<br /><br />  Mal Bowen
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A little long in. The tooth but a great story none the less.<br />I really enjoyed the parts about how different 1958-1963 were<br />From today
B002Z58GQS|5.0|Works as expected.  Great service, good product.  I transferred a ton of pictures from my lap top to my desk top in just two loads.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|one of the best lincoln books ever right up there with carl sandburgs lincoln. this book gives a  great insight into northern politics
B0030B0S2Q|3.0|The film dragged at times. The only problem I had was with the downloading. My internet service was fine but your downloading process was terrible. I watched a Netflix movie right after yours and had no downloading problems and yet when I went back to your service it caused at least 30 delays during the duration of your film Moon.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Hint button is awesome, didn't last long enough! WAITING for the next one. So hurry it up please, can't wait!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The best of the &#34;Vacation&#34; series. It is Great Fun to watch it every year with our family and friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Started out a little slow but once the plot got going, I could not put this down. Very emotional romance story. I cried.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I like that you have to make a town travel and you could fish
B0070Y46UY|4.0|An inventive story, though occasionally comprising prose broaching the jejune. I find myself involuntarily, and unfairly, comparing nearly all contemporary writing with that of Ian McEwan.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was good, but in the middle it got confusing because it missed so much in between the days. Other then that it was s great book
B0067RQYNW|4.0|A good APP for the price.  Took me a little time to get use to it but found it to be good for what i wanted in using spreadsheets on my Kindle Fire.  Would recommend it for the price but there are other APPs that are probably more flexibly but at a higher price.  PC
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole series was well worth the reading. I don't normally read romance novels, I am more of a Stephen King reader. For three romance books to keep my attention is exceptional. I will read and reread for sure.

B004SDEP38|3.0|Wanted mainly for use on my Kindle Fire with spreadsheet function.  Did not work well on the Kindle but may be good on other devices.  Wanted something that I could edit and update easily, just not what I thought it would be.  PC
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Amazon~<br /><br />We purchased this game on our kindle for $3 and once you get to a certain level, you have to pay again.  Really??What a way to rip someone off.  Kids don't fully understand this and then they get upset.  Plus, now I'm hesitant to purchase your games in the future.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game very addictive play this game all the time never gets old many levels . Even when u finish. The game it is still fun because u the to get 3 stars on very level  I highly recommend this to anyone
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Eastwood is able to examine the human condition, in this case ageing, in a way that even in a self-deprecating role, shows it for what it is, reality.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Now I am going to have to buy the next book. It is literally addicting to read. The more I read the next more addicting. This book series is definitely worth reading.
B004I744AS|5.0|Found this APP to be a very good dictionary as well as a good source of everyday general information.  I like the word of the day feature, horoscope, local weather, birthday of important people and other features.  I recommend this APP to all who want a good dictionary and extra features.  I found that you need to be connected to wifi to get full use of extra features other that the dictionary.  I use it on the Kindle Fire.  Can't beat the price.  PC

B00002N9ER|5.0|This set of clamps is a great &#34;helper&#34; to have a flashlight handy right where you need one. It is great because you can use bolts, wood screws, even rivets to mount them anywhere you want. I've got one set mounted on the wall of my garage right by the light switch and another set mounted to the top of my subwoofer enclosure behind the driver’s seat of my truck. It is also nice that you can easily adjust the distance between the two clamps to fit any length D-Cell flashlight. I highly recommend this product.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a highly entertaining series with a neat twist at the end.  There is some clutter caused by technical detail, but it forces the reader to think about how difficult it would be to survive in that particular dystopian environment. It also shows that the author took time to research - or maybe he was a plumber and an electrician before he started writing. The contemporary vernacular will date the text, which is too bad. But, that said, I would HIGHLY recommend this book. Really good story, good characters, and, I repeat, I liked the ending.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Great design and quality and a steal!  I will repurchase from Snugg again!  Did I mention the high quality?  Awesome.
B000058USU|5.0|EMI's choice of recordings for their GROC series sometimes raises the odd eyebrow, but there can be little doubt about the inclusion of this one. Klemperer, recovered from the travails of the previous decade, was in incandescent form despite his advanced age and partial paralysis. So many reviewers have adumbrated the virtues of this noble, majestic account that I won't rehearse them here but will make a few, brief observations. It's not perfect: the fugue concluding the \\"Quoniam\\" section of the \\"Gloria\\" lumbers somewhat; the soloists are not as starry as Karajan's or Bernstein's; the sound, while good for its age, is inevitably a bit congested - but these are minor cavils set against the transcendence of Klemperer's vision.<br /><br />In an ideal world, Marga Hoeffgen would be less matronly, although she manages much magnificently; Kmentt would be able to muster more heft and steadiness for the \\"et homo factus est\\", Talvela would blend better with his co-singers. However, Soederstroem's soprano is a joy, soaring effortlessly in a manner which almost rivals the peerless Janowitz for Karajan. The greatest glory of this set, apart from Klemperer's direction, is the bite and energy of the New Philharmonia Chorus, expertly drilled by Wilhelm Pitz, and the unaffected mastery of the violin solo in the Benedictus, which goes straight to the heart without being quite as soupy as Karajan's Schwalbe.<br /><br />It's not the only version of this work to have; Giulini, Bernstein and Karajan also have their story to tell - but it is enough to convert any waverer to the Klemperer school.
B000SEGCRS|5.0|Great information and very down to earth and understandable . Also what made it more fun to read was the author's humor, kept it at a more interesting read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Item came on time.  Was a Christmas gift and the receiver is very happy to have it.  Thank you very much.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Received this in lightning speed!  I was shocked how quickly it arrived.  It is such a streamlined, functional case and I would highly recommend it!  Lightweight.  Securely holds the Kindle....you can hear it snap and lock the device in.  You can adjust it to any level you want.  It is a quality product!!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is an amazing game. to any of you world of warcraft fans, this is probably the best portable version of it you'll find. When I played it reminded me of World of Warcraft. It has mates, support people, and the other guys. Also you can play multiplayer! There is only one problem though. I plug my earphones in when I play this and have it at a decent level of volume. Then when I open the game, it blares at full volume and the only way I could make it stop was by turning my kindle off. Other wise, this is a great game and I highly suggest it to anyone.
B0076DELIG|1.0|WOW. I've read about a dozen or more of Michael Connelly books and most of them Harry Bosch novels. I've enjoyed them all very much and so thought it was a no brainer to upload another onto my Kindle. At this writting my Kindle says I'm 40% done with this one and all throughout these pages I've considered ironing or washing the floor as more entertaining options to do with my time. I can't for the life of me think this is the same Connelly. I usually can't put his Bosch novels down. With this one I keep wondering when it'll get going. Something, anything that will finally peak my interest. I like books that grab me within the first few pages. This one still hasn't and I'm almost half way thru. It's mind boggling that this book has as many great reviews as it has. I must be missing something. Something big. If anyone out there can enlighten me I'd love to hear what I'm missing. Otherwise I think I'll upload something else to read. Save this one for when I can't fall asleep. Sorry Michael.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is amazing... Not just point and click or hidden objet : adventure, logic, little memory (but the map is there)<br />I merely was disapointed when i finish the game...<br />I wish it will have a sequel<br />Great i recommend to buy
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|This toy was a big hit. Well made, all water-based paints, perfect for little hands. Would definitely recommend this item.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I played the original game on my sister's iPod and I really enjoyed playing it. So when I saw it on the kindle, I got extremely happy and bought it. Even though it costs money, it's definitely worth it. This app has way more tools than the regular one including a straightener, bows, and even a curler. Also, the people look more real so u can make it look like u. You should buy this game. :) :)
B005VPRET4|4.0|I think Lego is heavily slanted toward boys and was excited when my daughter (8 yo) told me about Friends.  I think it is a great ideal and she loved the set.<br /><br />What I don't like (and this applies to all current Lego sets) is all the sets are so specialized.  I find it difficult to be creative and build other things with a set.  Once you put together the City Park Cafe, that is pretty much it IMO.<br /><br />Overall it it s typical Lego product - well designed, good quality, over priced
B005NJU8PA|4.0|So, first off, I have to say that this is a really good book and did meet expectations. I already knew (as should have anyone else that can read the sub-title or any reviews) that this book is more than about just cooking, but it was a *little* too much.<br /><br />For the main focus of cooking (DOM) that everyone expects, I think the book does a great job of taking someone from 0% to 80% of cooking knowledge. As you go through the book, each recipe is actually a certain type of skill that can be applied to other dishes, which in my opinion is fantastic in terms of the teach-a-man to fish rather than give-the-man a recipe. Additionally a lot of the recipes have different variations or alternate styles/methods so you can cook the same recipe multiple times for different results. Along with this, the book does a great job of walking through the recipes step by step with beautiful illustrations to accompany most of the steps. So as far as kitchen-cooking for beginners, this books gets an A+.<br /><br />No onto the not-so-good... A lot of the non-cooking extras in this book are a little much and, as many have mentioned, are very scattered. The book is a great example of the ever-so-common method of \\"compile all your interesting blog posts into a book\\" that many authors are following. Don't get me wrong, all of the information is incredibly useful (for the most part) and interesting, but it really shouldn't be semi-randomly inserted into the book. Honestly, probably 10%-20% of the main book should have either been moved into the appendix, saved for a future book, or just put on the blog. This especially applies to half of the WILD section (which should almost be its own book), and the end of the SCI chapter.<br /><br />Anyway, my overall opinion of the book is that it contains a lot of great information, but really could have used some better organization. Four Hour Body in my opinion was a similar book in its encyclopedia-like approach, but felt a lot more organized andon-point... at least within each section. That said, the information contained within this book is a steal for the price.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books and the trilogy was a great price. Definitely cheaper than buying each book separately. Very interesting and unique.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|The FiiO E7 is simply amazing! The pair of cans I use in coordination with this sound noticeably better. Even my pair of IEM's are improved as well. A neat thing the E7 does, is that when it's plugged in and charging and you're using it while listening to music, the FiiO logo at the bottom lights up and changes in brightness in coordination to whatever you're listening to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in a matter of hours. I couldn't put it down until it was over. One of the best books I've read!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, kept my attention all throughout the book. Sorry to have it end, wanted the story to continue.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|This Barbie &#34;dream house&#34; is really only useful as a pretty Barbie box. It holds several dolls and accessories. My daughter never uses it as a playmat, only to store her Barbies.
B009DH37CY|5.0|Fabulous concert.  Highlight is Freddie singing one of their folk songs for sure.  A must have for ANY Queen fan.  The out takes and excerpts are superb.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is a lot of fun to play and is highly addictive, a little slow on updates but still a great play.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Much better picture and sound for this classic 1986 movie re-done in Blu Ray.  The &#34;Original Ending&#34;  (some 20 plus extra minutes) was never seen in theaters or on the older DVDs of this Movie.  You have your choice of either ending in this Blu Ray.  And the original ending (that was never seen) will blow your socks off!
B005BDZN62|5.0|I bought this for my grandma who used to love this movie. As a child I watched this with her a few times. It's a great movie.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was not very long and the story was hard to understand. The author threw all of these things together.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is soooo good it inspires to musician in me. Even though I don't play; I want to. It also moves the mother in me emotionally.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|I could only find the DELUXE version of this CD/DVD on AMAZON.  Its evidently not sold in retail stores.  Its worth the extra bucks for the DVD with the Music Videos.  It is excellent quality.  GET this DELUXE version over just the CD version.  Its Great!
B001383XT8|3.0|sounds great but doesn't take a battery  you have to use a plug for it  cant use live with the cord in the way
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I thought this was going to be just another small lego piece but it connects the the other castle and my boy loves it,
030758836X|4.0|I have now read all three of Gillian Flynn's fascinating books.  She manages to create a rogue's gallery of dysfunctional characters and Nick and Amy continue that trend, with Amy Dunne certainly being her most messed up character to date.  I am not sure that I would call this her best novel. I really enjoyed \\"Dark Places\\" as well.<br /><br />I have never really wondered about the minds of novelists whom I have read prior to that of Gillian Flynn. I don't think Stephen King is particularly messed up for instance, but Flynn I wonder about. Perhaps it was just too many Lindsay Lohan stories while Flynn was an entertainment editor. Who knows? But I hope there are some relatively normal people in her life, if only for her peace of mind.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is broken down into three parts with a major plot twist occuring at the beginning of parts 2 and 3. It is the twist in part 3 that kept me from giving the novel 5 stars. I just had too much of a problem believing the actions of the characters, though one could argue that it fit in well with the message that Flynn was trying to convey. A novel with this kind of twists is better left for the reader to discover.  It is well worth the ride and highly recommended.  I will leave it at that.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Rated this 5 star amazing work by Zep as usual, nice job Jason on drums.<br />I would definitly recommend this to others.<br />Shipped real quick from Amazon, keep up the good work!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Fascinating from beginning to end. Excellent novel! Usually I'm able to figure out how the plot will unfold long before reaching the end of Grisham's novels. However, this was different. It kept me guessing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book and will rope you right in. Can't wait for next month when I'll borrow the sequel on kindle owners library.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Well, since the kindle fire doesn't come with a camera included, they make you pay for the app. Eh. That's fine. Only $2. The app is fine. A little grainy, but fine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book though not complicated in style took my breath away. Amazing character dynamic and plot twists. The coincidences... It the way everything falls into place. My only real critiques that the best friends are both non existent when it's intense. It Makes you question how important Sky really is to them. It's a must read. I would definitely suggest it to anyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Unusual plot. Had some twists and turns that I didn't expect. I was intrigued looking into the mind of a killer.
B0050R0XPA|4.0|My daughter loves legos. They keep her entertained for hours.  She is almost 12 and has been playing with legos from age five.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Would encourage anyone who enjoys a great thriller to pick this one up. Try it, you'll see.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Fun to watch - like the plot twists. Good acting all around. . . . . . . . .
B000HKW7E0|5.0|All all-time favorite!  I like watching this one even when it's not Christmas!  Everyone should have this in their holiday movie repertoire.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Like many others, I tore through this book. Sure, post-apocalyptic fiction is in, but this series is the best I've recently read. And the price is reasonable too.<br /><br />The thing that stands out for me - beyond the plot and character development - is the style and pacing the author uses to shape his story. Well done, Mr. Howey.
B0086700CM|5.0|its addictive  cant stop playing!! really like that game its got such adrenalin that a lot of people like awsome!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It is refreshing to read something from the perspective of a child due to its innocence and lost view of the huge world we live in.
B0052FYPJK|5.0|As expected from the great Sensei.  Its a great start to having his collection of books if you haven't brought any yet.
B001NPDCFQ|1.0|Like some other reviewers I encountered a problem with audio dropouts. These dropouts occur during most of the songs, such that the soloist singers are not audible. The problem is due to the operation of the Blu-ray player: mine is a Samsung BD-P3600. I found that the problem seems to be related to the digital conversion from bitstream to PCM. When I reconfigured the player to use the Bitstream (audiophile) digital output rather than PCM the dropout problem was solved. Note that this solution requires one to use a receiver that that can decode DTS-HD Master Audio.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great product, easy to use, works very well, great selection of products, no lag in page turning
B009VB998I|5.0|Thought this might be a nice bit of fluff, but rather this was a well-executed, substantial offering.<br />Stunning, beautiful visuals.<br />Well-written dialogue.<br />Nicely subtle morality tale.<br />Engaging for adults and kids.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Very cool graphics!<br />Kind of different from the TV series but I really liked it too!<br />I'm a Walking Dead&#34; fan for sure now!
B002VPE1XE|2.0|Case is WAY too big for the size of the camera.  Won't fit in a small purse or a pants pocket.  Am VERY disappointed!!!
B002B554TO|5.0|I absolutely love this album! It was also the perfect gift for my boyfriend who also loves Florence! Can't go wrong buying this one!
B009A87ZKG|5.0|This latest blu ray version  was twice as good as the last blu ray version.<br />It  looked  more realistic than before.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|My kids managed to purchase some very expensive \\"gems\\" and other things from this app.  $50-100!!  I had to delete this game because of it.  So sad.  They enjoyed this game.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app, got for free and use often for local radio stations. Drains the battery but I guess that can be expected.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is the best, or one of the best war movies of all time.<br />I bought the regular DVD box set years ago, and now upgraded to the Blu-ray set.<br />But the Blu-ray discs don't seem to be any better than the regular DVDs'(they are both great though).<br />If you already own the DVD set, I wouldn't spend the money to buy Blu-ray.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Well done, great sound! Anne Hathaway did a great job. Unfortunate that it will always be associated with a tragedy. Maybe making these types of movies need to be ended.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|We received four of these from Amazon for my husband's Kindle.  None of them worked.  He now uses the charger for his Sprint cell phone and it works great.  I wrote to Amazon about our problem, but never heard back from them.In the process of receiving these four useless cable he also received four  new Kindles.  It was not the Kindle but the cord, but Amazon didn't seem to care.
B000002UAU|5.0|I had the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band on vinyl back in the day. I was very pleased to be able to get this CD at the price Amazon was asking. fast delivery and quality item.
1606995359|5.0|I have been an Uncle Scrooge fan and a Carl Barks fan for years.  The contents appear to be a great reproduction.  The book appears to be well bound.  It would, in my opinion, be a great addition to anyone's collection
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is simply amazing!! I never put it down once I started reading it. The story line was amazing and so thought out. If you don't love this story I don't know what's wrong with you. I couldn't wait to find out the ending but am sad the book is over!! I highly recommend this book!!
B009MO58G6|5.0|I had this album when it came out. I lost it. I bought it again.<br />It is my favorite Prodigy album, maybe because i'm into rock music.<br />The fat of the land ...is an album that can't be placed in one genre. Sure it's electronic , but it's filled up with others genres...you have punk ( Breathe, Firestarter, Fuel my Fire) hip-hop ( Diesel Power),industrial influences ( Serial Thrilla, Mindfields, Climbatize) even some alternative rock ( Narayan...great voice here by Crispian Mills that's the dude from Kula Shaker).<br />It's an album that gave everything , that did influence at the time many bands and left nothing to be experienced.<br />Masterpiece.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|great series
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves putting these &#34;puzzles&#34; together.  Great way to help him learn the right shapes in the right spot
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Not for the theater purist, but an interesting twist and well done!  I am enjoying every bit as much as the original soundtrack.
0395925037|3.0|Curiosity killed me to get this book.<br />I'm not sure how real is the text here or another piece of ''let's make some money''...like Hitler's table talk.<br /><br />The book itself somehow is a little bit boring. Don't think that Hitler will talk about himself to much. Is about economy, racial ideology, Jewish Communism and how he got into politics.<br />Sometimes i find the book funny, Hitler jumps from one idea to a totally another one . This clearly shows his anger and his state of mind.<br />Is a very interesting history lessons, because he writes a lot about it.<br />Reading this book will not make you understand him as a man. But somehow it will make you understand his actions. The mastermind behind WW2.
1419705849|5.0|My 10 year old read this whole book in one day!  I let that speak for itself. He loved it!
B007N8RULO|3.0|I am really used to playing spider on my computer at my desk. using the kindle fire spider is a little different, i have to get used to it. all in all still fun
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love Hachi the movie,and I cry a lot...It is a beautiful story about love and loyalty,as a dog lover I relate with this movie and the unconditional love of Hachi with his owner,because I have personaly expirence that kind of love with all  my dogs  and I pray to God that if is posible, I will love to go to dogs heaven
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|It does everything I need it to with no extra junk. I recommend it to anyone wanting to shoot video who wants good audio to go with it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wasn't thrilled with Book Number Two but this final book made up for it.  Great finale to an entertaining trilogy.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It is stupid that in order to rate a movie you have to make comments equivalent to a certain number of words.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Not only is great for kis,adults will love it the same. It will make you cry,but is worth it.Love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great! It is a fun game and the ads are only at the beginning. This app was free so have fun.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game,simple and addictive. Grab this one, worth $1 for certain.<br />I have it on iPad too. Gets more challenging with time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Way better than the movie! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone a and everyone!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I use my Kindle Fire Tablet to check my Facebook account when I'm away from my computer.  My only complaint is that the screen on my Kindle sometimes rolls and goes back to the beginning as I'm reading posts.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This playright/novel is an unexpected story of two people. It has a powerful kind of love that we strive to look for and the storyline in great. Overall a great story
1451638647|4.0|This novel suffers in comparison to Ms. Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan adventures, but it is still fun to read.  I enjoy her writing style very much.  I recommend it for those who have already read her other novels.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very nice calculator. Just wish it would rotate view. Other than that it's perfect. And it's free! You can't bet that!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|This is a great movie if you like amazing dancing, great &#34;get up and dance&#34; music, and everyone in the movie is dancing their butts off, working hard, sweating, yet making it look easy for all of us!  And you also get a relate able story line, a little romance, and of course the hot bodies doing incredible moves!!  5 stars all the way!  I love the whole Step Up series and the actors are all handsome and buffed!  And the actresses are beautiful.  I would recommend this Step Up series to everyone!  As always with Amazon.com products it arrived early!
B0086700CM|4.0|THIS GAME IS A NICE GAME AND I LOVE PLAYING IS A GAME I WOULD TELL SOME OTHERS ABOUT AND THEY WILL LOVE IS ALSO TO.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read approximately 3  -4 nonfiction books/month but only 1 or 2  fiction work a year!  This book may change my habits!
030758836X|2.0|I never comment on the books Inread, but I had to on this one. It starts out as a great book. A definite page turner that is different than others on the market. However, the ending is so bad it ruins the whole book. It doesn't even make sense with the way to characters are built up. It's like all of a sudden she decided it was enough pages so she would tie it up in 5 pages or less.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Camera works really well, camcorder not so much.  As soon as I tried to make a 1080p video the app crashed.  Normally not a big deal, but now I can't even change the resolution back because you have to select video mode to do that (which promptly crashes the app because of the 1080p setting).  There needs to be some way of changing the settings for both camera and camcorder in the options menu so this can be avoided.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved the concept. Great graphics, decently creepy. I liked that it wasn't overly complex. Zoom is available for hidden pictures and the hints will bail you out, if needed. Overall, really enjoyable game!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|This is an amazingly amusing film!<br />We have watched it with many family and friends...folks even dress the parts!<br />Highly addictive in it's own way...gotta love &#34;for the greater good!&#34;
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This is the most well-crafted LEGO set I've ever had the pleasure of putting together. There are quite a few intricate, specialized pieces and a great attention to detail. Payloads hide inside fuel tanks, the different stages of rockets are easily unattached with a simple snap, there are actual spring-loaded pistons for the landing gear. There's a lot more to this set than what you can see from the photographs. Also, just in case anyone is wondering, the shuttle does perfectly balance itself in the stand and is held in place by simple holders so it's easy to take off and on.<br /><br />Ended up taking around six hours to complete. Well worth it.
0307276902|5.0|ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER READ IT I HAVE TWO FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE READ IT A COUPLE OF TIMES EACH AND HAD FOUND IT QUITE HELPFUL, SO I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO WAS OR WHO IS GOING THROUGH AN ADDITION OR HAS A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS OR WHO IS.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Very much enjoyed the writer's style, and the plot had me guessing up until the very end. Not what I was expecting! Will be checking out more by Mr. Crouch.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Great characters and awesome settings. Stays true to the original, yet manages to blend a complimentary sense of humor. Must see if you are a Tim Burton fan!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|It is missing some key songs from the movie but over all it is pretty good. Its is not as complete as the Broadway version, still it is a great soundtrack.
B00563M11M|5.0|Discworld novels have never disappointed me. They are a joy from beginning to end. I absolutely love the clever humour, from heavy satire to subtle irony - no malice, all good fun.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|If you like Mumford and Sons you will enjoy The Lumineers.  Very similar sound and style, I enjoy both very much.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|PROBABLY THE GREATEST PRODUCTION I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE MUSIC, SETTING AND CHARACTERS WERE OUTSTANDING! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
B006O7XOOW|1.0|Seriously, who ever at Fisher Price designed this really pulled a fast one on the company.  This thing is pointless and poorly designed.  It does one thing.  Your kid is better off learning how to pull up and stand at the couch than this.
B005XT4932|5.0|The main reason to purchase this as an album is if you loved the movie &#34;Streets of Fire&#34; which is horribly dated now.  But &#34;Nowhere Fast&#34; and &#34;Tonight is What it Means to be Young&#34; are still cool songs.  It's Nostalgia Lane for me, but still music that I smile and gets my heart beating when I hear them.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Directions would have been nice.  I am not an intuitive game player and just could not figure out what the object was/is.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This Movie is so funny! My teenage girls and keep laughing every time we watch it! The music isn't bad either!
B008VBYN80|5.0|Does not require a lot o  time, but still very fun. No need to buy in-app tools. Still fun without them.
B006X08FDA|4.0|I got this as a whim hoping I'd like the sound. It's pretty good. Love the singers voice. Nice to listen to on a long drive.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Bought this for my son for his birthday.  He was thrilled and I find myself asking to borrow it o occasion as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app every day. I love the plans and that you can get different versions of the Bible. It is so organized and easy to use.
B0086700CM|2.0|My son likes this a lot.  I find it a bit dull, but I'm new to tablet games.  Just watch out for the in-app purchases.  Kids using this won't have to enter their parent's password to make purchases (hint, hint).
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. The higher levels get challenging.Put it on your Kindle. It's free to load. great game!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is a great soundtrack because it is the actual live recorded songs from the movie.  When you listen to this you feel like you are back in the theater watching it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. It is very addicting and quite the mind challenge in higher levels. My grandkids love this so too.  Thanks!!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My 6 y/o son is absolutely addicted to anything Star Wars.  This app fulfills his needs for fun & jedi fever.  LOL!  He's even beaten me a few times.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|I like the news and it is excellent for tracking your stocks! You can check your stock charts quickly and news about each company. Very user friendly.
B007XF4J70|5.0|It's very easy to write this review.  Casablanca is the greatest and the blue-ray disk displays the movie perfectly.  Watch it over and over.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Funny. like Greg. I like this book. I recommend this book to any one. It's really cool. You need to read this book.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting an action adventure movie. The actors were great and the plot was believable.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I used to play games with only a limited sense of purpose. Pop some bubbles, plant some melons, blah blah blah. But then I discovered laying pipe. I love laying pipe! I lay pipe by myself, but I have the most fun laying pipe with a partner, or even in a group ;) I wish I could get paid to lay pipe, but until then I am still going too keep it up.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Really never watched MIB 1and 2 but will see the the original.I really enjoyed this movie. Liked Josh Brolins's agent K early years.<br />Agent J was in his good character. Liked the evil Boris.Special effects were good.<br />Probably not a good movie for younger children 10 and under.<br />Worth the rent.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy to play and fun. My five year old can play it and has fun with it. It's very easy, just touch the screen it does all the work.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I liked the movie and I loved Caviezel in it! The movie was entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone wanting action adventure.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Arrived on time and is a must have for all holiday collections.  Bought the standard dvd so as it can be watched wherever i am visiting.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love evermore. It helps me wth my to dos and editing documents. I just wish I had a reminder option.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|My Goddaughter loves this cd.  It was a great Christmas gift.  She was thrilled to open it.  It is a good gift for a 11 year old.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is an excellent case that keeps it safe, clean and convenient.  I would recommend this to anyone who buys the HD
B001DE29SS|4.0|Great movie that i enjoyed. I learned a lot about Chaplins life. I loved the begining of the movie but i was a little bored towards the end. But its based on someones life so I guess Im glad they didnt add in anything just to make it more exciting.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|It's official: Lockout is a modern guilty pleasure of mine I genuinely enjoy watching over and over. I know it's cheesy, I know it's low budget, downright ridiculous and a poor man's Escape from New York, but unlike the dreadful Escape from L.A., Lockout has won me over with its charm.<br /><br />Guy Pearce plays the cliche wise cracking, too cool for school, Snow and absolutely nails the role. His performance is tongue in cheek, but he looks every bit the action hero in the scenes that calls for it and delivers his one liners with perfect comedic timing. I found the humor in this film to be genuinely funny where I laughed along with the writers and cast instead of laughing at them as I would with other campy flicks. It's a shame Pearce never had that breakout role to become a leading man because he certainly has both the acting ability and the charisma to carry a film. He's cool, he's tough, he's funny, yet he might not be as smooth with the ladies as we would think - Snow is just a great character. Not to get too political here, but I also think Snow as a character is a fierce individualist with a Libertarian streak who tries to live his life on his own terms without succumbing to statist or corporatist pressure. At one point he is criticized for being a \\"relic\\" because he chain smokes cigarettes in a time where \\"nobody smokes any more!\\" I just love this guy.<br /><br />The premise of Lockout is far fetched, but creative in my opinion. It's the future, Snow is some sort of secret agent framed for a murder, there is a high tech prison orbiting the Earth and in it are the President's daughter and an incarcerated friend of Snow's who can tell him the location of a mysterious brief case he needs. After the prison is taken over by rioting inmates, Snow agrees to infiltrate it to rescue the President's daughter and to find his friend to get the location of the brief case. Simple, stupid, but so much fun. It is not a badly written script, it works for the popcorn flick this is. Action, humor, and space in one movie? Count me in.<br /><br />Aside from Guy Pearce nailing the lead role, the supporting cast deserves credit as well and are a delight to watch on screen. There is a crazy Scotsman who has to be one of the better bad guys I've seen in a movie in a long time and a much larger, intimidating fellow who leads the prisoners while serving as a balance to the Scotsman. Lennie James, whom you may remember as Morgan Jones from the first season of The Walking Dead (a character we all would like to see return the series), plays Harry Shaw who is in regular communication with Snow throughout the film and the two have great chemistry with one another similar to McClane and Sgt. Al Powell in Die Hard (just nowhere near as deep of a connection). Maggie Grace is not as annoying as I feared and plays your standard hot damsel in distress which she admittedly does well in movies/shows like Taken and Lost.<br /><br />What are the downsides to this film? Well if you're a big John Carpenter fan then you might have heard that this was supposed to be a sequel of sorts to Carpenter's beloved classic Escape from New York starring Kurt Russel as the raspy voiced Snake Plissken. That cult classic is a much darker film with a subtle but serious underlying theme driving the narrative; it focuses on suspense and tension over one liners and charm, and it manages to suspend audience disbelief in its admittedly over the top premise of Manhattan becoming a prison colony. To many Carpenter faithful who wanted a true spiritual scuccessor, Lockout will not deliver what you're looking for. I myself am a huge Carpenter fan, but after the abortion that was Escape from L.A. I figured it's best to put that series to rest and start anew. Like it or not, for better or worse, Lockout does its own thing.<br /><br />Another downside to the film which actually prevented me from paying to see it in theaters is the PG-13 rating. I have just purchased the unrated DVD from Amazon, but from what I hear even the unrated cut doesn't go beyond PG-13 standards. Lockout does not need gratuitous sex or violence to be good, nor does it need a particularly dark tone and theme, but the movie would have benefited tremendously had there been at least a few kill shots to see. Instead we are stuck with typical PG-13 cut away shots which rob us from seeing some rather creative deaths courtesy of Snow's keen survival instincts. If a bad guy has a collar around his neck that is about to explode, then I want to see the head explode even if only for a second like in the movie Scanners; if an enemy activates a booby trap by hitting the trip wire and suddenly finds himself staring into a gun about to unload in his face, then I want so see it unload in his face as if this were a Paul Verhoeven film! The crazy Scotsman character couldn't be quite as menacing as he could of been thanks to the rating and how dangerous can a PG-13 prison really be? A lot of tension is instantly removed before even seeing the film because you know your eyes and ears are going to be protected by the rating. As charming and sarcastic as Snow is, I would have liked to have seen him in some real danger to see if it would have any effect on his nonchalant attitude. A little, just a little, Verhoeven style violence (Robocop, Total Recall) could have gone a long way in making this movie something truly special. Lockout feels like it was outright censored at times. EuropaCorp needs to make R cuts for their DVD releases, leave the PG-13 cuts for theater goers if you're worried about ticket sales.<br /><br />Well that's it, there is my review of Lockout. I really liked this movie, it won me over despite its rating and cheese ball nature. It's just a lot of fun for me to watch and definitely classifies as a guilty pleasure. It's one of those movies you recommend to your friends not because you think they will enjoy it, but because you sincerely hope they do enjoy it so you can find others to share the guilt and fun with.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It starts off easy, but gets a little harder.  It is a fun little game to pass the time with.
B00969PR18|2.0|I downloaded this app while on a trip to Alabama.  I put my home address (in Nebraska) into the the app to get a map to home.  It could not locate my address.  This is the only map program I have ever used that could not locate my address.  Removed App.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|Being a HUGE X-Men fan, owning all of the X-Men movies, I really enjoyed this movie! I saw it in theaters and really enjoyed the story and characters! The movie takes viewers back to a prequel setting, showing the story of Xavier, Magneto, and Raven (Mystique). The movie offers a great story line with a wonderful character development! A must have for any X-Men fan!
B003TY3F06|4.0|I like the convenience of this purchase its my first instant purchase but the quality could be a little better but all in all its serves the purpose nicely
B003TSEEDY|5.0|As a guy who played football in high school, had a lot of friends, was closeted gay and felt completely alone all at the same time, I loved this book. If everyone was like the main character I think there would be peace on Earth. Please read this book because I think you'll realize that everyone has unique problems regardless of how they choose to deal with them.
B000EZ7ZZE|3.0|I rate this product with 3 stars as I like it, is a good movie to see I recomen it

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|really was a nice movie I bought for my son we watch the movie together . Surprise me that how even the animal protect their territory
0307346617|5.0|I'm not a big believe in the doomsday stuff or a zombie fan - but this book is just fantastic!  The pacing, the writing - Max Brooks just brings you into this whole universe that's very believable and detailed.  It's a real page turner!  I've suggested it to several friends and everyone so far has loved it - definitely a must read, even for those not into Zombie lit!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Another great Lee Child's novel.  I think with &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; now on the big screen that Child will become even more popular than he already is. I think Cruise may be a little young for the title character in the movie.  I think Reacher should be played by someone older like Nick Nolte.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|fun difficult until that bad upgrade happened so just sayin i didnt like it so enjoy this okay game of my opinion &iexcl;!!!!!!!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Completely worth the price. Would recommend this game to anyone.  The map is extremely helpful and keeps you from having to use the hint button a lot.
0062112430|5.0|I really love this book! Although it is unlike the hunger games, they both have dystopian societies. I won't say more without you reading the book!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I did not expect to enjoy this book as much as I did.<br />I found it a bit slow at times, but was totally hooked and read the last half in one sitting.
B007SGM084|5.0|Well I finally got to see what the fuss was all about for this book. I loved every minute of it. Like every good book I hated to get to the end. Look forward to reading more books from E L James
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book, couldn't put it down.  Leaves you in suspense and wanting more. Ready for the next book to read.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Does not rely on special effects for the bulk of what you see. Film making outside the lab, still the best way.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is the best drawing app you can get. You can choose from paint brushes, markers, crayons, and colored pencils. You can also choose from many backgrounds and use stickers!!! You can also draw with many different patterns. Buy this appppp!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Using the Kindle for Android. It is so easy to switch from my IPhone to my Android. Everything from downloading, to keeping my place marked. This Kindle is as good as any you buy in a store.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I recently took my children to see the Hobbit and came home to buy the triology that followed. It has been enjoyed by all of us!!
B0094RCD5U|3.0|\\"Massive Attack\\" I'm sure was supposed to convey intensity, but honestly I see no evidence to back up this claim. I mean, that DOT placard doesn't even meet OSHA or NFPA standards - it's supposed to be white lettering on the red background! This is a disaster, people. Not to mention that it's clearly only a level 2 hazard which is maintained easily enough. Massive Attack? More like Mediocre Attack. Only three stars for lack of research.
6305558167|5.0|The classic tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is done in grand fashion.  The attention given to every detail from medieval weapons to period dress is unbelievable!!  Nigel Terry is wonderful as Arthur but the real standout for me is Nicolas Clay as Lancelot.  He would appear a few years later as Lady Chatterley's lover in the movie of the same name.  He is one of those rare actors you can't take your eyes off of when onscreen.  Although a fairly long movie, it holds your attention and the story never skips a beat.  If you love historical period pieces, then this is right up your alley.  ENJOY!!!!!!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Super addictive game. Love it. My only complaint is the requirement of peanuts for some things, they are impossible to get without buying them with real $$.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|was worth the money ......cant wait for the sequel .....I totally recommend it ..should make more games like this..good day
B00003CXBK|5.0|I adore this film, and have seen it countless times, and I finally purchased it. I love this film, and it has this amazing message. This classic film will get into your heart, and it will become one of those films that you just get a huge craving to watch, and if you own it then watching is easy!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|There are not enough words to describe what a superb series this is!!  The entire set on multiple discs is housed in a beautiful box and once you start watching the story, you almost can't stop until you have finished!!!!  If Ancient Roman culture is your thing, this box set is the ONLY one you should have!!!  It includes every major historical figure--Julius Caesar, Augustus, Marc Antony, Cleopatra, Brutus and many, many others.  Woven into the story are many other characters who, more or less, are depicted as key elements moving the entire story along.  You come to know the different characters and the entire series becomes a part of your own life long after you have finished viewing it.  It bears watching many times over.  Be forewarned--it is quite graphic in its depiction of violence and sex.  Not for the squeamish or the prudish.  ENJOY!!!!!
B004EPZ034|5.0|[[ASIN:B004EPZ034 Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked]]<br /><br />If you love Alvin and the chipmunks, you'll love this 3rd DVD Chipwrecked. Though there may be some scary parts in it for the little ones, older kids (about age 7 plus) would find it exciting.  Obviously parents use your judgement. The movie uses many similar phases as the 1st 2 movies, which will seem boring to most adults, but kids love that repetition. Hope this helps! Enjoy!
B0000AUHQT|4.0|I enjoyed the book and wanted to see the movie.  Big fan of R. Redford., the Great Gatsby.<br />Does closely follow the book.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I love this Killer's album. They always seems to slightly alter their sound from album to album. This album is reminiscent of Sam's Town, and rates higher than their last album for me. I pre-ordered this album and the first 2 weeks I got it I couldn't listen to anything else. Even now I feel myself drawn to the album. It's a great album, and if you were put off by their last c.d. you should purchase this immediately, it more than makes up for it!
B00006JDU9|5.0|can't wait to see the next one.  great cast  special effects are great.  worth watching several times.  nephew loved it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once I started reading I couldn't stop it just keeps the reader drawn into the story. I would highly recommend this book
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this is an awesome app because it has all kinds of games on it so yes I love it.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|My husband and I cracked up laughing throughout the movie. This was surprisingly very hilarious, cute, and a little disturbing at the same time (weird seeing a teddy bear do sexual innuendos in a grocery store.)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great drama.  If you like movies like Pride and Prejudice, the English, and castles in a soap style you will love this series.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was so funny and I liked the ending! Great job Kinny! Hope you have more Wimpy Kid books!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great game to play in between semesters. hidden object games are great and easy fun. and this one is a little creepy. fun!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I started out loving this game completely. However, I am now not able to get the game to load. Just as I was able to accumulate quite a bit of \\"booty\\", it stopped letting me play, so to speak. So for right now my strong 5-STAR recommendation has fallen to a weak 3-star. Maybe someone knows why it won't load for me now.<br /><br />Dec. 31, 2012 Addendum:<br />Still not sure why my original installation quit working, but I dumped everything and reloaded it and now it is fine once again. Having lost my accumulated \\"booty\\", has actually spurred me into new vigor to get back where I had been, so the end result is all good! Back to a 5-STAR rating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First, let me start by saying that this author knows how to write.  Even as hard as it was for me to get through this book at times it was so beautifully written. There were definitely times where I needed a \\"chapter break.\\"<br /><br />Second, this book was not really at all what I was expecting..not sure what I really was expecting but it definitely wasn't ALL the extremely tough subject matter that she brought to the forefront.  Now with that said, you should try to remember that and prepare yourself for the extremely difficult subject matter. However, there is no way you will be able to fully prepare for all of it. I know I didn't see quite a few things coming.<br /><br />In summary, I loved Sky and Holder so much. As their relationship plays out they take another piece of my heart. This story really is amazing and everyone should do themselves the favor of reading it...even if you end up not liking it. I think all of us that read it will always remember this story...I know I certainly will.  Thank you Colleen Hoover for yet another amazing book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very relatable story and I connected personally to Charlie's character at some parts and to other characters at other parts.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Excellent picture and sound is adequate. The story follow the movie. I definitely recommend this movie for scifi affcionados.<br />A thumbs up.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Kind of a sick concept when you think of it. Kids killing kids .. Come on people, what is the mass appeal here
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome. Fun and exiting. Reccomended to the people who love temple run. Favorite game in the history of the world!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this book, but at some parts it`s kind of cheesy, but other than that, it's really good!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Classic holiday movie me and my kids LOVE!! Must have:) love amazons prices and prime shipping is freakin awesome!! Seriously! Prime is well worth it! But anyways this movie is seriously one of my favorites!!! Every kiddo should see it:)
B0076DELIG|4.0|One of the better in the series.  Read straight through. Did not want it to end.  Love Harry.  Hope another comes soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|got this on my iPhone this is just the same great game very addictive spend far to long playing this when I should be doing other things easy to down load.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME because it is better than  the other bingo games I have on my kindle fire HD  and you get to  talk to other people in the game
0307592731|4.0|Cheryl Strayed's mom passed away, and her life subsequently fell apart, including her relationship to her step-dad, her siblings, and her husband.  She decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail for several months to center herself; the book goes back and forth between her experiences on the trail and her life before.  I was moved by the intensity of Strayed's experience.  She has gone through a lot and she goes through an honest search for solutions but with no certainty that she'll find them, just an effort to avoid the completion of a tailspin.  She also refuses to wrap up her existential journey tidily.  \\"What if I was never redeemed?  What if I already was?\\" (258).  Her experience on the trail is exhausting, inspiring, and occasionally harrowing; rarely boring. (She also talks through the books she reads on the trail, which I enjoyed.) I don't know that I learned from Strayed's experience, but I read elements that spoke true to me, and I was glad to be a trail partner for a few hundred pages.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audiobook, read by Bernadette Dunne.  Dunne read a bit too evenly given the intensity of the book, but it was all competent and clear.<br /><br />Note on content: Strayed goes through a lot - the book has extramarital affairs, heroine use, intense anger toward God and the universe.  There's some language (12 f-bombs; 8 sh-bombs), and I remember one reasonably explicit sex scene, towards the end of the book (if you just want to skip that bit, it's pretty obvious, as it's preceeded by getting out a box of condoms).
B0058YPLA2|5.0|it was a christmas gift for my sister so i do not know how the dvd are untill she play them
B00785P2QC|3.0|I think this game is ok. it keeps you busy for hours, but it also kills the battery life on my kindle, which sucks. but it is a good game to play if you are trying to kill time.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I have to say I like this comic despite it being different than the series which I came to love. If a zombie apocalypse ever did come this is I feel a portrayal of what may happen. Though there really isn't time given to get to know the ins and outs of all the characters perhaps this shows how truly deadly this world is, giving and taking within a breath.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy to read and I couldn't put my kindle down! Looking forward to the next book!<br />Highly recommended!<br />You won't be disappointed.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is one great movie and the 3D was terriffic. They did a great job of bringing all the charachters together and I loved the personality conflicts.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I would consider the goodwife series to those who are fans of the show and who continue to watch it and those have never watched the reruns.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Highly recommend this for any avid fan of the game.<br />Love the fact it gives you different play options.<br />A truly great feature allows you to go back and undo one or more plays so you still have a chance at winning. Just overall, a really awesome app!!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|It's history, adventure, harmony, science, biology, and suspense all wrapped into one unreal piece of nonfiction!!!<br />Thank you for this incredible insight!<br /><br />The only con: I felt that, by the beginning of the last third of the book, the writing became monotonous. I hate to admit it, but I skipped part the last two or three races he recants, and moved to the end.  This in did not take away from the awesomeness of this MAJORITY of the book. I could just have a short attention span and therefore an biased. This guy's story is truly inspiring and awe-striking.
B0043RSE2M|1.0|Very disappointed with this purchase as it was not sold as listed. I have a new 3d Tv and loved thius movie and wanted the 3d version.  It was only a regualr Blu Ray.<br /><br />Bright spot was the easy return of the movie with Amazons Amazing Return System.
B0081SPK0I|1.0|Installed this for the free app of the day so I'm not extremely mad since I didn't pay money for it.  I saw all the ad networks and uninstalled it right away.  Paid apps shouldn't do this crap.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|This is a surprisingly good game for my Kindle Fire HD 7\\". It's just like the mazes I played as a kid, where you had to move a metal ball through a maze to reach a hole. There was little replay value with those, however, since once you mastered it, it was the same thing over and over. With 3D Labyrinth, there are a lot of different mazes (they call them maps) with varying degrees of difficulty. The balls roll very accurately when you tilt the Kindle Fire, and the sound effects and graphics are quite good. Winning isn't just a matter of getting the ball in the hole - the game records your times, so you could compete against friends to have the lowest elapsed time.<br /><br />Some of the mazes are really clever-and tough-with moving flippers and other shapes that can hinder you or help you, depending on how you play them.<br /><br />The game uses OpenFeint to compare scores, but you're not forced to register with OpenFeint if you don't want to.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Clean, easy to read.  I'm only looking for the temp, so I haven't really explored.  I do like the hourly forecast.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Have had this app for years on my IPod and love the way it controls and tracks charging. This is a nice transfer to the Kindle and is a little more attractive in this larger format.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great graphics and music.  I can't explain how awesome this is.<br /><br />At times it can be too hard though and forget about beating the OCD challenges.  Some of these I just can't figure out either!
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Worthless. I'm not someone who is offended by vulgarity as long as it is tasteful.  Seth McFarland has converted funny voices into a career but IMO his talent as a writer is zilch. If you are 12 your parents should not let you watch this garbage. I stopped watching about 30 minutes in.
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|Oldie but goody. Classic movie for the Sci-Fi lover. Forgot how good it was. I recommend this movie for any collection.
0670451495|5.0|This is such a classic children's book.  I grew up in Massachusetts, so everyone I knew read it since the story takes place in Boston, but every child will enjoy it no matter where they're from.  This edition is beautifully presented; it's a large, hardcover edition that is well bound with excellent prints of the original illustrations.  It's a great book that my mother, myself, and my nephew all read growing up.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good, interesting plot and good action sequences. Definitely worth a watch if you like the genre.  I will watch the next one to come out.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very nice game, highly addictive!  The pause button lets me come up for air!  The game itself runs smoothly.  I highly recommend this game.
B000VD5I94|5.0|Oldie but goody. Classic movie for the Sci-Fi lover. Forgot how good it was. I recommend this movie for any collection.
B000HKW7E0|2.0|I purchased this one at the same time as Elf.  If reloaded also, and I was very disappointed.  Why can't it just play continuously?
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Cute app but was constantly asking my children to upgrade or buy other apps. This app stayed linked to my prime account so I deleted before the kids cost me money unknowingly.
0894803123|5.0|Dastardly Mash is no longer sold by B and J so I am very happy to have the recipe which I've already made. I've made three different ice-creams....it's all GOOD! I love their bio story too.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I wouldn't watch this expecting a too serious of a storyline. This movie is what it is: laughs, sexy men, sexy dance moves-mainly by Channing Tatum! If you have not seen this, grab some girlfriends, a bottle of wine & some snacks & just enjoy the scenery! :0)
B000YHG72E|2.0|I was disappointed with this purchase.  If I pay to stream a specific movie, I expect it to play all the way through without &#34;skipping&#34;.  If I want low quality, I'll get a VHS.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|an error message comes up ( marmalade v5.2.1 (300266) too many controls added to layout manager. could anyone tell me what I need to do?
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Thought I would never get through this book but kept at it expecting some answers only to discover there are 2 more books. I think I'm done.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's hard to give an honest opinion of this book without giving it away.  This story, the way the author paint this picture causes you to forget to breath.  My heart broke just after the half way point.  It continued to break and heal through to the end.<br /><br />I don't know if my mind will ever part with this story.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I found this game to be very fun and challenging, but it can also be very frustrating as well.  I have even deleted and then installed the game again and to no avail.<br /><br />I have problems with the game giving me much smaller &quot;bubbles&quot; and then saying that I<br />lost even though I have plenty of balls still left (sometimes as many as 200 +).  Hope there is a fix soon.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Bought this for my kindle fire. I have one of the worst memories and decided to get a notepad to type things up. The program is fantastic and I have no problems with it whatsoever, but I do find typing on the kindle something I still need to get used to and so have not used this app to it's fullest potential. I think others will like it though.
B008OOYALE|2.0|This is a cool game, but the pop up announcements at the beginning are just killing me. Every Single Time you open the game, you get the same announcements--such as what new dragon is available or whatever. It doesn't happen once a day, nooooooo, I wish. It's every flipping time you open it!<br />I went as far as contacting the developers to ask them to curb the pop ups but here we are today with a half-dozen &quot;announcements&quot; at every start.<br />I recently uninstalled Bakery &amp; Restaurant Story (also Team Lava) because the same stupid pop up announcements were added endlessly to my frustration.
B004KBSQOW|2.0|The rest of the songs are in Hawaiian, not really that good.  I listened to Somewhere over the Rainbow, but couldn't make it through the other songs on the CD, I don't know Hawaiian, and the harmonies weren't there.  I think the CD might have been put together in haste.  Not really worth the money.
B008602KQI|5.0|I Love this movie, have watched repeatedly and cannot wait for the next installment to be released and will be buying it also
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game. Not too difficult and is great for killing some free time in a waiting room.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|what a great album that still lives today with even more fans then when it was released some 40 years ago.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK!!! It was the most interesting page-turner that I've read in a long time!! Highly recommended to friends!!!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|very cute for the younger group.  My grandkids get a blast playing at the different scenes and levels increasing in toughness
B0081J95TE|4.0|I've been a fan of Garbage for quite a few years now and while I enjoyed this album, in my opinion it wasn't quite up to the same standard as the others. I am happy to hear, though, that they are one of the few bands that have maintained their sound over the years.
1442354747|5.0|Lincoln was of great interest to me from my grade school days. These extraordinary CD's only reinforce the image I've held these many years. Politics hasn't changed much, only the actors. I guess when you start with a good plan it continues to work whomever leads the parade.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Before getting half way through the book one can pretty much solve the \\"mystery\\". Even so, still a twisted story.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|this game is a hoot,  love the music and the game levels are very interesting.  Would recommend this for all
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This CD has many of Bob Marley's greatest hits, and is an excellent addition to a Caribbean or Reggae music fan's collection. Every tune is a memorable one, and I caught a Christmas special for I think, one or two bucks!
0316056871|3.0|Eh. I think part of my disappoint for this was there was so much buildup. There were 58 holds on this book before I recieved it at my library! This is just not a 58 hold book.<br /><br />I felt like it was all over the place. Which was fine but at times I felt like, \\"Okay, she is going to grow in traditional, chronological order and tell anecdotes from each stage of her life.\\" Which she did...to some extent. But then she would have a random essay thrown in, followed by two totally random chapters about what it was like to be really skinny and really fat and then back to chronological, typical autobiography order. I wouldn't have minded if it was JUST random funny essays about unrelated topics in no order, like a Sloane Crosley (spelling?) book or JUST a traditionally written memoir but it was like ADD. Pick one! I guess this is not a huge deal if you enjoy the book, but to the English major in me, it felt sloppy.<br /><br />I just felt a little bothered by the idea that she still thinks she is an everywoman and seems so proud of it. Yes, she has a baby and a normal family life and was awkward growing up (who wasn't?) and seems to the public eye to be for the most part down-to-earth, blah blah blah. She is probably more in touch with what the American public thinks than MANY celebrities. Clearly she has more in common with the average woman than Kim Kardashian. But I just have a pet peeve when celebrities try to downplay things like the fact they make more in a year than I make in ten years, and that because of their celebrity, they have EVERY opportunity (WRITING A BOOK WHEN YOU ARE NOT TYPICALLY A WRITER, ahem) most \\"normal\\" women will never have. At least not have so easily. It's not even just her, I feel like any celebrity interviews I have they are pandering to their audience by implying they are just like us. Let's be real here. It's not as if we have nothing in common, but we are not that much alike. And I don't just mean in material ways. End rant.<br /><br />Also, I felt like she picks and chooses when she is mean. She ranted a little in the book about women she would never make fun of, I can't even think who, and how we are all a sisterhood---I am paraphrasing. Basically the whole philosophy of Mean Girls. But there are certain people and things she has no issue being snarky about because she is a comedian and that's her job. Well, either view is fine with me, but those are two opposing extremes.<br /><br />I do think she has done a lot for women in comedy and honestly women in general. She has shown that women can be intelligent and funny and she has kept all of her body parts well covered for the last 10 years! I don't want to take that from her because for female celebrities that seems so rare! I love her as a comedian. Parts of this book were funny but parts were irritating. It also had this feeling of \\"I AM TRYING SO HARD, LIKE ME. HEY I AM AWKWARD AND CLUMSY JUST LIKE YOU!\\" Which may be a silly complaint, because that is what fame and comedy are all about, becoming more liked...so I don't know...I feel so wishy washy about this book!<br /><br />Just changed it to a 3 because I realized Lauren Conrad and Paris Hilton have \\"written\\" books which I would give a one, and Tina Fey deserves to be more than a step above the likes of authors like that!
1451688091|5.0|I liked the inside story of the Lincoln Administration and loved learning about how Lincoln political allies from former rivals!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|rebought this dvd after original copy was misplaced.  loved all the harry potter movies and this completed the set i had
0553807919|5.0|I can only recommend this beautiful rich book to all parents, teachers, care givers and friends of children. And not only the children! We, adults, can have such a deep value from this incredible publication.  Thank you, Daniel!  Halka from Prague
B003L77FYS|5.0|The stories are clever. O.k. once you know from the start who the killer/thief was, the next time, it's a surprise!<br />The characters are well done, the humor is great! And Stana is just sweet! If you like Bones, you will love Castle!
B00A77II0U|5.0|LOVE it! well done and definitely worth the money! I was so sad when it was over (p.s. thanks for the bonus play), definitely eagerly awaiting the next Alawar adventure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! It had me wanting to know more the more I read! I just started the second book and so far it has me engaged in the same way!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|If you run out of energy close the ap and wait a little bit.  when you reopen it your energy replenishes to 23....
B0053O89IS|5.0|I liked the 7th season a lot! There's a development of the characters (not all though), the interpersonal relationships take upper hand, but in an interesting way. The relationship between Booth and Bone steps up to the next level. I was not dissapointed by this season and I am looking forward to Season eight!
B005HSL626|3.0|It is a fun game and for passing the time when<br />you are bored it will help. I think it is  a fair game<br />but not that exciting.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I can only say two thumbs up for a tale of magical fantasy that keeps you enthralled from page one. Get it for the youngest reader in your family to the oldest.
B003L77GRO|2.0|Many of the DVDs could not be watched. Didn't return it because I found a way to watch the season online, but this was a disappointment.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Season 7 is very funny, the story moves on between Marshall and Lily, and Ted is still looking for the mom of his children!<br />There's great laughter, I wouldn't wanna miss one single episode! One, if not the best, sitcom on TV nowdays!
0788812408|5.0|Classic movie at an excellent price when I couldnt find it anywhere else.  VHS quality is ok - but my kid didnt seem to care that it wasnt blu-ray.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it was a very good book, but maybe in your next book Greg meets a pretty girl who is interested in the same thing Greg is interested in. OR he becomes best friends with Bryce, and all the girls all a sudden love Greg.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started I couldn't put it down . I've seen the movie and as I read the book it all played in my head ...
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Watched the whole season within a couple of days. Single episodes are well done, the \\"main\\" stories go through several episodes, which is interesting to watch!<br />One of the best mistery/crime/comedy series on air! Temperance Brennan is fun to watch when it comes to be \\"human\\"! If you liked the previous seasons, you definetely want to see this!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very good story, difficult to put down· I highly recommend this series.  Much more than I was expecting of it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great product sent very quickly.  No problems.  would do business with this person again.  Product just as advertised. Very happy.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I would recommend this book. This book wasn't as bad as I thought it would be so that was good.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Comes with everything, totally awesome collectors item. It's great to finally be able to just buy the blu rays, I heat those Blu ray/ DVD combo packs!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I was so glad that it arrived in time for Christmas.  It added a little extra.  Everything was as I expected.  I could't be any happier with the product and arrival time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Some books are hard to love.  You try for 50 or so pages and you just never feel that tingle of joy.  But, sometimes you fall head over heels with the first 6 words and even though you hate to be parted with it, you still rush headlong toward the last sentence.  I enjoyed my several dates with this book...immensely.  beautiful story about the best of human nature and the importance of words as salve and weapon.
0547884591|5.0|This book is a winner. The writer is witty and funny and I've already learned how to make scrambled eggs from him. Some of the recipes are &#34;out there&#34; and I'd never try but the scrambled eggs are worth the price of the book since I've never liked the way I made scrambled eggs. He also got me to read &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; which I thoroughly enjoyed.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|It is a good game but it keeps saying there's a update for it but there no update to be found
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|I got this as  a gift for a friend and she really liked the stickers and they hold very well to her tile wall (she put them up in the bathroom), but the stickers are folded inside a box, so some of the stickers and fold marks going right through them! And they haven't flattened out on the walls!
B000007XUQ|5.0|The talent and range of the Carpenters is part of musical history.  It's just a shame it had to end so early.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Great Story but the writing was a little off-putting. It was often hard to tell whose point of view the scene/chapter was in. All in all, however, the plot was good enough to put up with the irritation of the WAY it was written.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app my favorite combination is music box and river it put me right to sleep.  I would defenently get recemend this app. but it took a long time to download.
B0031TZASY|4.0|I would not recommend this book to younger children.  Too hard to read and it would be confusing.  The story is thought provoking and it does make you think you are out in the ocean alone.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I love Tom Clancy's attention to details. A very plausible story line. I've read all of Clancy's books and while they sometimes have a little too much Rambo in them, they are nontheless great entertainment and thought provoking
0812992784|4.0|I tried to read &#34;Satanic Verses&#34; TWICE - once because it was highly praised by those who &#34;should know&#34; . It was awful so I tossed it. I bought it a second time to be supportive of Rusdie after what happened to him, but couldn't read the book that time either. Joseph Anton, however, is excellent, well written and interesting. Makes me wonder if Rusdie is better at nonfiction than fiction.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game so much I think you guys would love it to. So if you think it is stupid it is not
B003U6BE8I|2.0|If you've read the books, you will not like this movie. Many of the characters from the book are missing and the ending of the movie was horrible. Rick Riordan should do like the Spiderman movies and create a new film that actually follows the books!! This movie was a great disappointment.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Nice music, interesting story, fun characters. a nice movie for the whole family. Great musical for anyone. Almost as memorable as sound of music or Oklahoma
014312093X|4.0|I bought the book because I saw the movie and wanted more detail. The movie was better than the book because Oldman, Firth, et al were better characters than those Le Carre created.
B005LAII08|5.0|The story line was more imaginative than most of the cartoon type films.  Very enjoyable to watch and I've already watched it twice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From the first page of the series I was captivated. I read the whole series in three days. You won't be disappointed
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another great book. Never thought I'd enjoy this series but  Can't wait to start the next book. Recommend this series.
0060873027|5.0|The late Michael Crichton was one of my favorite authors. He disappointed in a few books and soared in others. &#34;Micro&#34; was one of those Crichton books that gave the willies even as it made scientific  sense -- almost.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|this is a great show for fans of the zombie genre from all iv seen it has a great story  terrific make-up  although the cg deaths are a bit under-classed by the big screen still a great show with a lot of good talent
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting story, told from an interesting point of view. I was afraid of a predictable ending...and I was pleasantly surprised!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is just an excellent game, and a must have for any family or individual who loves to play games. You are basically accumulating resources in order to build settlements, roads, and cities. This game is great for teaching critical thinking in that players have to develop strategy, and they also must learn effective trading techniques. Great for young (probably no younger than 10) and old alike!
B0060AY6FO|5.0|How many Darcy and Elizabeth books are written that disappoint? This is one that does not. If you like mysteries and P J James &#34;Death at Pemberley&#34; won't disappoint. If you want a readable post &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; by a modern writer, this is for you, too.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|What thoughtful and entertaining read. For the first time in my life I feel I have a personal connection to the nothingness that we are mostly comprised of. At last I can bat away the why's from naive mouths and force feed them back the how's.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I HAVE USED MANY WEATHER APPS, THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE. I RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY. YOU CAN ADD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I was lucky because I started this book on a day when I had the time to read it from start to finish without (many) interruptions. I loved it! Ever since this book came out I had been wanting to read it, but I never got much further than that. Later on it was suggested to me and then given to me as a gift.<br /><br />As the title implies DO NOT START IT OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP! This book was amazingly addictive, and book lovers everywhere need to read it. The topic is deep and serious but in some way the book was not as depressing and downcast as most books on this subject would be. I don't know what it was...but it had me hooked.<br /><br />The characters were great, the story was amazing, and I give the author two thumbs up. I don't think I could have been happier with how it all flowed.
0525952926|2.0|Not as good as &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; and/or &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; or &#34;World Without End&#34; mainly because Follet seems more interested in promoting Socialism than telling a story. I didn't like most of the characters -- they were cardboard cutouts. I reviewed this on my blog which can be found by Googling &#34;Growltiger's Litter Box&#34;.
B009VLX8FS|2.0|Every song has a catchy tune to lure you in, but the lyrics... oh, the lyrics.  This album was a disappointment from the word &#34;go&#34;.  In every song, certain lines are made from a single word, either repeated over and over again, or strained out through the entire line to try to make it through that stanza.  I had so hoped for growth from this singer/songwriter, but alas, it is more of the beginnings of what could be something much better.  The writing, musically and poetically, are amateurish and petty.  Let's hope the entire writing team, including Ms. Taylor, can do a lot of growing up and express more than a tantrum over some spilled male hormones in the next gift of 16 songs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book I love it so much! The trilogy is so action packed I'm excited to read it again!
B00933JL0A|5.0|This is a very addictive game and I love it.  I have it on my phone and Kindle.  The only issue I have with the Kindle version is I haven't found the ability to use my prestige to make the ads go away or how to receive the updates.  May have to uninstall and then install the new version but I am still checking.<br /><br />The new version auto-installed on its own.  I absolutely love it.  If you can say something is more addicting...you get seasons now and the huntsman goes after the deer and so you have meat to go with your fish and bread.  I am surprised they aren't hunting the rabbit and geese yet but perhaps that is a future update.  Enjoy.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Laugh out loud, movie! I was almost not tempted to watch it as a talking bear was in it, but over all very funny.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love love love this book! I didn't think I was gonna love it this much, it has such a great story I love each & everyone of the characters especially Charlie, Sam & Bill I really recommend this book, is not super long but the content is very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it is one of the best free apps! It's just so likeable. It says that you can purchase things with real money but it is only 1 thing. I have a kindle fire and it works great! I am just going to say TEMPLE RUN DOES NOT WORK well on kindle fire.
0805086846|5.0|Bought for a friend. She lost her first copy and wanted another. No no no no more words dumb dumb
B009B0L324|5.0|Great Album of a Great Band with an excellent sound in a awesome stadium. Always recommended FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK!!!!!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Love this cd! The tracks not played on the radio are my favorites. Reminds me of old Fleetwood Mac before the chick singers, when they played more blues.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I think this book was wonderful, but the writing was amateurish. Otherwise it was a very good book! Yes I recommend it!!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Robin Trower used to remind me of Jimi Hendrix guitar- This CD is almost as good as I recall from my college days forty years ago, I have no idea why I was grooving on it more back then.  That's my story....
B00004WG2F|5.0|Legends of the Fall  (1994)  Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn, Julia Ormond.<br /><br />Rated R.<br /><br />(First lines, opening voice over)<br />\\"Some people hear their own inner voices with great clearness and they live by what they hear. Such people become crazy, or they become legends.\\"<br /><br />This is not a sappy chick flick whatsoever like the poster seems to indicate.  Its viewpoint is decidedly masculine.<br />A family saga with many dimensions and profound themes. It's all anguished passion and unleashed emotion.<br />Love, death, jealousy, revenge and redemption.<br />The cinematography is stunning to behold.<br />Filled with melodrama and tragedy, this sweeping  epic set in early 1900's Montana is<br />at it's core a soap opera for guys,  a tremendously majestic journey both beautiful and brutal.<br />Big sky country meets father/ son issues.<br />A bold and masterfully bittersweet James Horner musical score, one of his most emotionally evocative,  wrenches all of your senses throughout. Its remarkably soulful theme will never leave you. Ever.<br />There is no doubt that we are all splintered souls.<br />Herein lies the haunting echoes of Cain and Abel and a brother's broken bond.<br />And what exactly is behind a father favoring his wayward son?<br />Warning: this motion picture may be too intense for sensitive children to be exposed to so send them to bed early. Depressed individuals beware.<br />How quickly life passes us, almost unnoticed,  and how things taken for granted disappear before we even have a chance to glimpse their presence as they melt away.<br />A strong Native American theme underscores this film,  hinting at our inner mystical voice.<br />This movie is nothing less than a spellbinding feast for the soul.<br />There's something very special here.<br />Be prepared for unforgettable buttons to be pushed....and pushed...and pushed.<br />This is truly a superb motion picture, a one of a kind experience that explores the dark side of the human condition. Surrender your emotions and let yourself be transported to an other time and an other place that will take you away to visit somewhere that's almost other worldly.<br />Painful or not, happy or not, meant to be or not, destiny is rarely of our own choosing.<br /><br />Quote:<br /><br />Tristan: You know when Samuel died...

B006LSZECO|3.0|This story is initially a page turner, but once you &#34;get&#34; the zinger, it drags on. Not sure I'd recommend it.
0446571415|5.0|cant wait to start this saving for vacation this weekend otherwise i would finish it before i leave. Baldacci is incredible keeps you interested and wanting more.
B000002U82|5.0|I don't know how a &#34;Rock Band&#34; could contain classically trained musicians as Pink Floyd did- the survivors still play well.  Dark Side is my favorite CD.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I let my 6yo son play this on my Kindle and then one day I notice that I have a $1.99 and $9.99 purchase on my Amazon account. He bought something called Mighty Falcon Small Bundle and Mighty Falcon Large Bundle. I looked around on the app and found there is even a 19.99 bundle that you can buy. It just takes 2 clicks to make the purchase, no password required. I had no idea they added in app purchases on this one. This will probably be the last Rovio purchase that I make.
B000002HK4|4.0|Should have picked up some of their works much earlier. This group is awesome! I will be getting more of their stuff.
1455518999|5.0|but i LOVE Baldacci's work and i'm sure this will be another great read.even his different genre Wish you well was so well written that i hated when i had finished reading it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|only used it yesterday in car in the big storm.  easy to read and quick.  Like it a lot.  The other radar I downloaded was useless.
B00029D04M|5.0|I am having a great time assembling, painting and placing numerous decals on this beautiful airplane's model.<br />Bringing it to the final condition really is taking some time: but that's the whole fun of it!<br />All the parts in this set are fitting neatly. However, some considerations should be taken: about the order of parts attachment and the painting procedure. I am intended to complete this project with all possible accuracy, and therefore the detailed follow-up of the instructions and an additional research and analysis on the placement of decals and on painting is crucial.<br />A piece of an advice: never rush with your job - and you'll love the result!
B008S80P38|4.0|This group is very intriguing, I will definitely have to get more of their music. This selection is well worth your time.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|this book takes the pilots checklist andbrings it to medicine specifically surgery. lots of food for thought here. good read too.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The action in this movie is rare, and when it does get to the action it's not as well written as the previous Bournes. I think the biggest mistake this movie has is not keeping Matt Damon in the series. If you've seen the Bourne movies before, you know what it's about so there was no reason for the long talk and explanation in the first half of the movie. Obviously there should of been more action. And what's up with the ending, is it supposed to make you think another Bourne movie will follow? Anyways, when you have a good actor like Matt Damon doing a great job, why throw in a different main actor? I was hoping Jason Bourne was going to finish what he started...What the heck...??? Other then that some action scenes were great, some good acting.
1593082037|5.0|A nicely done volume and a real deal at this price.  A great way to meet the world's first consulting detective.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|From everything to 9/11 jokes to religious irreverence, this movie leaves no victims. But, all in all, it's pretty clever and funny.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Like it and is fun but sometimes locks up so I had to turn off tablet then turnit back on otherwise I like the challenge..

B007TK77QE|4.0|I enjoyed it I havent read the Harry Potter books so may read them some time soon.<br />Thank you for the E book version
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I seen this at the IMAX and had to have it on video. I like the extra features in this package. I like the Ultrviolet package most it allows me to take my movies with me where ever i go.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never get bored playing the old tried and true classic of solitude to pass the time.  Nothing fancy, just brain exercise :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i love this game! As a big mlp fan it is wonderful to see all the characters outside the show. couple of complaints, first they made princess luna the bad guy. but she becomes good in the second episode, and thats how twilight finds her true friends. second, it is very difficult to save money for expensive ponies. but overall a veru worthwill game.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I am sure that I have read it before and have definately seen the movie but am really enjoying it again
B0092QITO2|3.0|The graphics were very good but the story was lacking. Why do movie companies remake old movies? cant they come up with new ideas for movies
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but downloaded this on my new kindle fire and couldn't stop reading  soon as I got it!
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is from one very biased on the play - I have seen it fifteen times. This concert is not the play but very close in experience - full costume and some staging.  If you accept the fact that a movie, a play and a concert on the same story must be done differently, but all can be done well, then you should enjoy this immensely.
0307887448|5.0|Rich genius dies, and leaves all his wealth to the one person who can win a game! Has references to the 1980's, the decade the rich man was a teenager.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Although I ordered this as a gift, I have been informed it was very enjoyable and arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner
B000O179EK|5.0|Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors and this is one of his best<br /><br />My favorite Bridge's movie is True Gritt.<br /><br />Both are great.
B003QSMC18|5.0|A fun tale, and the New Orleans scenery, characters, and culture make it much better.  The music is enjoyable as well.
0316187216|5.0|Just finished it last night, loved every bit of it.  Abercrombie is becoming my new favorite author since Robin Hobb's last couple of books have just been....meh.  Love the returning characters, which I still feel is his strongest creation this side of Tyrion Lannister, and the book was great.  Definitely worth reading after reading the first law trilogy and the previous two books to get the details.
B001HQZJP2|5.0|I ordered this movie as a gift with several other movies and it was very enjoyable and in excellent condition on arrival
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Has a music box included. This was a surprise to me<br /><br />The last time I watched the Sound of Music was on a bus in Austria. We had just visited the filmimg location.<br /><br />This has a book, extras DVD, and a music box<br /><br />If you like the movie then this is a good buy.
B004SUDQE0|5.0|Wish there were more movies like it - especially - in recent years.<br />This movie tells a tale which is more than the seemingly silly<br />obsession & tremendous effort of a small towns people working<br />to make their hill into a mountain so it will be on the map.<br />It is not only beautifully funny but also very touching!<br />A witness of people working together with a sense of purpose<br />not for any personal, material gain, something which is totally<br />lacking in todays society.<br />I saw this movie when it first came out and felt the same way.<br />And I am glad to own it now, it can be watched again.....
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my young teenage son.  This is the only series of books he will read.  He loved it and read it right away.
B009Q54K6U|5.0|i heard this on youtube this was great cd  i recommend this cd very highly<br /><br />you should check out the othe 3 cds
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This CD was purchased for my grandson because he had it on his Christmas list.  The price was good and my grandson was pleased to receive it!  His reaction confirmed I made the right choice!
B003204MQS|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat...I did enjoy it... I have seen the II also..not a bad movie either.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|This is a excellent version of the knights of the round table.  This musical captures the spirit of Camalot with beautiful songs and acting.  Richaed Harris is a perfect King Aruther and Vanessa Redgrave was never most Prettier.
B003K16P3M|3.0|It will come as no surprise to anyone that this novel is Cashore's first - from page one, the author's clumsy, faltering narrative style is at many times both jarring and lamentable. Syntactically, I often found myself appalled by Cashore's linguistic choices. I spent more than one repetitious, lamentable sentence after another rolling my eyes and questioning the commendations of Cashore's editor.<br /><br />However, as a novel, \\"Graceling\\" accomplishes much more than its poor narrative structure would usually abide. Katsa, it's main protagonist, is not only a refreshingly modern, unique exploration of femininity, and a thoroughly believable badass, but provides a fascinating, candid insight into the nature of humanity and the feminine ideal. She is smart, able-bodied, and tough; but perhaps even more invaluably, she is deeply, intricately, and understandably flawed,in a way that makes her sympathetic without making her weak. Her main love interest is similarly complex and multi-dimensional, and their romance is not only fiery and titillating, but arises and is maintained through a deep personal relationship and mutual respect.<br /><br />Certain central concepts within the novel go unexplored, and overall, the story suffers from the poor construction of certain narrative elements and a bland and repetitive narrative style. But these strong lead characters - along with the well-worded, frequently brilliant dialogue - drive the story forward and make it, if not an enjoyable read, a highly tolerable one.
B008G59IKO|5.0|I purchased this CD for my grandson because it was on his Christmas list.  When he opened it, he was thrilled.  The price was very good and I was pleased at my grandson's reaction.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Pretty good, the others are better I thought. I only saw about 2/3 of movie..then forgot to watch the rest before my 24 hrs was over.... I will watch again later...
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I rented this movie. I thought the production quality was very good.  However, storyline was a bit too dark for my taste.  Not a movie I would purchase and view repeatedly.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I couldn't wait to see this.  In fact, we had it on Netflix list and since it was snowing, we decided to pay for the rental.  It maybe that there was too much hype prior to seeing it, but I didn't think it was all that great.  Yes, it had very funny  moments, but I don't think I'd be quoting the lines.  In my opinion, it is definitely NOT another Hangover.  I'll stick to watching that over and over.
B000001DQI|5.0|I purchaded this CD for my son because it was one of many on his Christmas list.  When I saw this on his list, I didn't hesitate to purchase it.  How could you possibly go wrong on an Elton John CD?  It didn't hurt that the price was very reasonable!
B002XZFCH6|3.0|Ending is not the same as the ending I saw on VHS-so I was not too thrilled. I like the 'other' ending far better.Great flick tho
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|All of these hidden object games are why I had Santa bring my family a kindle fire.  They occupy my mind so well I miss favorite Tv shows!  Well worth the money to get the full version.  Graphics are pretty good which makes finding items rather easy.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|One of my favorite TV series. Absolutely addicting and a must see. I hope there are many more seasons to come.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas. She had watched it with her uncle and like every other kid ended up falling in love with it. Great price and arrived in excellent condition!
B005LAII1C|4.0|I  got this movie for my husband for Christmas and we watched it together on Christmas Eve. Exactly the kind of movie I was expecting. Fun story with lots of trash talk...but we loved iit still.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game sooooooooo much I almost unlocked all the people I love tricky and Lucy I completed 5 missions in a day so moll and I got the super miserly box
B007J4T2G8|5.0|:) exciteding to get it! Haven't read the Wolfe thing yet! Will thought soon! He he he he he he
B004EPZ034|5.0|Bought this for my daughter to complete her collection. She says it is her favorite so far and watches it almost every day since we bought it!
B000FCK42M|5.0|Best book yet on the AFO cartel in TJ.  Truth disguised as fiction. Mr. Winslow understands the Mexican drug wars and writes like a master.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Great soundtrack! I loved the movie and having the music to listen to everyday is great!! Definitely a good buy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I so enjoyed this book that has been called teenage fan fiction, and I'm in my 40's. The first two books were so hard to put down and I can't wait to read the 3rd! I easily lose interest when reading fiction but these books have held my attention consistently throughout. Thank you for a truly enjoyable series that has given me a great respite from the humdrum of everyday life. :)
B003KUSUG8|5.0|As always Eminem has seemed to top himself again. He always knows how to speak his mind and his bears are sick!
B00622BF40|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie. I finally purchased a copy. Even though dated, it is always fresh and captures my interest. I always catch something I never noticed before. Lots of Aussie actors that you will recognize from other Australian films like Muriel's Wedding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is so funn but i have a complaint not about the game but about the people who give it 1 star or 2??<br /><br />you probs give it 1 or 2 stars cuz the shop makes it crash down. Well then helpful tip:<br /><br />DONF GO INTO THE SHOP WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT TO BUY ANY MORE GADGETS OR HOVERBOARDS OR PEOPLE THAT MAKES YOU SOUND OBSSESED AAND U HAVE NO LIFE. ITS A GAME FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WHO CARES WHAT YOUR CHARACTER LOOKS LIKE OR SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />ok thats all.<br />thank you no I'm over with my rant
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Very useful for getting a different angle from the norm. Is completely adjustable for all three of my different cameras. Would recommend this to a friend.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy returns to the John Clark story line.  This continues the Jack Ryan series into older main characters and brings along the Jack Ryan Jr. character.  Did not want to put the book down.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I watched this video because of Seth MacFarlane...I love his work...but, the movie, Ted, fell short of what I have grown to expect from Mr. MacFarlane. It was like he was holding  back (or maybe he was held back?) But, again, I do love MacFarlanes' work and will watch his next movie.
B00821OW8K|4.0|Falling Skies Season 2 is much, much better than the first season and I am looking forward to Season 3. The premise is good, the action is very good, and I have grown very attached to the characters. Good shows usually have a nice progression and this one is following that path. I am looking forward to seeing how this works out.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Rod is very clever in his choice of songs and he chose very wisely for this album, the TV of the album was first rate and particularly loved the duet with Ella, a much slimmer Ella than I remember but very cleverly done. Would definitely recommend .
B0063IH60K|5.0|Keeps the mind going. My wife and I are over 60 and need to stimulate the thought processes, and this helps in that regard.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is wonderfully executed and the use of letters to tell the story is so good when done this well.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was recommended based on prior books I've read. I'm not disappointed, on to book 2. It has a hunger games feel!
B004MPEFBE|1.0|Would love to give this a better rating but being amazon has yet to allow it to download not possible.  Hard to explain to a child why it won't download.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't wait to get started reading this book after reading the first book &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34;.  I read this book in two days.<br />Very hard to put down.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great Graphics, Surreal Movement, Fast Paced, Engaging You Must Be A Quick Thinker With Quick Reflexes . Awesome. Play It
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is as much fun, and plays just as easy as the Super Nintindo version of Mario Brothers. If you liked Mario, or games that play just as easy, this is the game for you! Great fun.
159562015X|1.0|It starts out how you will find your best strengths and such and how after taking the assessment you'll be better able to put your strengths to work for you. What they don't tell you up front is that you have to go to their website to take the test AND you have to enter a code, included in the book, to enter the assessment. Well, the code in my book will not work and the only way I can take the assessment is to pay for it. That's why I paid for the book, so I could do the assessment. I'm not going to waste anymore money in order to take their online test. Seems like a scam to me. I'm done with it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Holy Cow !!!  What a great book !!!  Characters were amazing !!  Let EL James take you on a wild ride !!
B002TWWOHE|5.0|Another amazing tv show with convincing actors and And a never ending element of surprise- love it!! Looking forward to catching up on the seasons
B0096HID5M|5.0|Tom's musical talent definitely shined. The rock star attitude was unpleasant but understood. The addition of the musical talents of Diego and Julianna introduced my family to more musical options. Russell and Alec added an unexpected twist to the music.  All the actors blended naturally to portray a movie so entertaining and powerful you can watch it repeatedly with enjoyment
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've declared this my new favorite book.  I couldn't put it down. It's dry, twisted, witty, dark, and absolutely brilliant. It played perfectly like a movie in my head. Brilliant work b
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed reading the  last &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; book.  I was an awesome read.  The Characters were real and EL James is an incedible writer !!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green does not sugar coat the horrors and reality of dying. This book was tragically beautiful and the love that Gus and Hazel share is greater than any ever written. This is a magnificent book that I would highly recommend to any reader.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Adding season 1 of the Big Bang Theory to our digital library just made family time all that much more fun. The ease of adding it to our library and immediately watching the series was a pleasure. We are counting the minutes to add season 2
B003MYYJD0|2.0|THE FACE IS NOT BLUE IT IS BLACK.  WHAT IS THE MATTER?  I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE ALL BLACK WATCH
B0018RA6DK|5.0|Who doesn't love  Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in 48 hours !!  Great DVD !! It was alot of fun to watch !!  Flash back to the 80's!!  If you love the 80's , its worth watching !!
B0081KTI0E|5.0|A good watch on a night when there was worth watching on the hundreds of tv stations available. Well done and a good story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book fed into my fascination with criminals.  Besides the fact that it was an interesting story and held my attention, I always like a happy ending which isn't often the case with such individuals.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This book reads fast and provides inspiration to reduce inefficiencies and get things done.<br />I believe that the material is useful for all size businesses - not just people that want to start a business.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|Very inspirational!  I was very much entertained and impressed.  I was surprised to see how hard she worked.  Katy Perry is the WOMAN!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great read.  The book was quick, cute and funny. Nice vacation book and great to move swiftly through. I recommend.
B00000G3I2|5.0|This to me will always be a classic with a great cast.  DVD came packed well and in perfect shape.  DVD itself played well and very enjoyable.  I have not had any problems with any vendor I've used on Amazon.  If there was any problem it got taken care of and I am a happy customer.
B008MZPVP4|4.0|This is not their strongest group of songs but it still is a good collection of songs which I will always enjoy.  Favorites are 1,2, & 6
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Long movie that wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. It worth watching if you like scfi but it's not as good as it could have been.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love the time management games. Would really like to see more of them soon. I play them to keep my mind sharp. Thanks!
B000B8QG22|2.0|Was so happy to have found this edition of Robin Williams' Good Morning Vietnam only to find out that even though it looked factory wrapped when we played it the spoken words did not match their lip movement.  There was enough through the first ten minutes that you just didn't want to watch it.  The words seemed to be more than thirty seconds to a minute behind the movement of the actors and their facial expressions.  Made a great movie impossible to watch.  I will say that when I went to return it to Amazon they did send me another one which was fine.
B009FHRRAA|3.0|Bought it for the demos which are great plus 3 unreleased songs which you  could have found on napster back in the day
B0054JZC6E|3.0|keeps me busy for hours was for the kids to play easy to get the points to open new levels
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I think that it is just awesome.it really makes you think about evreything you do in it. I just lovenit!
B006O6F932|3.0|The accessories are nice but the playset itself is kind of flimsy. It is not hard to put together. My daughter loves it.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Interesting, awesome story.... horrible ending. The build up was good to the ending but then it just ended with no resolution.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book many years ago and it was great to read it again.  Wish it was a little longer!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Howey creates a believable, strange world where deeper questions about technology and society lie just beneath the surface of a gripping mystery.  If you like good apocalyptic fiction, read \\"Wool\\".
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I was completely unaware that this type of accessory existed but the Anker USB 3.0 to ethernet connector is exactly what is needed for a fast and easy wired internet connection for the new MacBook Pro which doesn't have an ethernet port, only two Thunderbolt, two USB 3.0 and one HDMI ports.<br /><br />There is nothing tricky about using this compact adapter:  just plug it in, install the software driver, and it works.<br /><br />Software installation is easy:  a cute little mini-CD with the software drivers is included but since so many newer computers don't even have an optical drive, it is easier to just download the software directly from the product page on the iAnker website (see comments).  On Windows computers, a driver may not even be needed.<br /><br />There are three LED indicators: solid blue for active network connection, flashing green for data transfer, and flashing red for data transfer at USB 3.0 speed.  The cable is about 6\\" long and there are strain relievers on both ends.  The USB plug fits securely into the computer and the port on the adapter holds the male ethernet cable securely as well.<br /><br />The speed seems to be just as fast as my normal direct ethernet connection and faster than the wireless.<br /><br />A sample was provided for unbiased review.
1400032717|5.0|I had read reviews of this book previously, and it seemed to be the perfect Christmas gift. I bought it in part because another author took it and wrote a stage play for it. The friend I gave it to is very interested in theater, and I hope the local theater guild will put it on.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Couldn't live without it...helps me everyday find things that I do not have a clue as to where to begin to look for them
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this story.  It was such a gripping, loving, and tender story.  The characters were so real.  The twists and turns kept me guessing and also kept me glued to the story.  Great ending, a very happy one!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has been one of my favorite card games since I could count. I love the simple options, classic design, and clean lines of the setup of this game.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This one's not for the kids and probably wouldn't hold a teenager's interest; expect strong language, coarse references/innuendo, adult situations and frank glimpses of the realities of aging.  That said, you can also be prepared for a film that takes its time on character development without ever losing the mellow, measured pace of a Carolina summer, where the heart of the story unfolds.  You will be slowly enveloped in a culture at times gritty and mercenary and at other times inspiring... the culture of baseball.<br /><br />But this movie doesn't stand alone as a sports piece; you'll be in for a disappointment if that's all you're looking for, and in for a pleasant surprise if you want a movie about real people and real problems that stays within the bounds of plausibility while being charming, funny and poignant.  It is about baseball, but it's also about family, love, the value of every day and the far-reaching consequences of our choices.  It's a film that never tries to shock you, or proclaim its own brilliance.  There are no grand-standing emotional moments, gun-fights, chase scenes or bedroom romps.  The seamless, well-written screenplay is delivered artfully by a director who knows when cinematic tricks would be jarring, and is content to let the story tell itself through his characters.<br /><br />Genuine, believable performances from Timberlake and Adams support Eastwood's quietly brilliant personification of a man who has given his life to a sport to escape pain, and is finally having to come to grips with human weakness and find an identity outside of being one of baseball's most talented scouts, as a father.  It's not a complex story, but the director refrains from a culminating flash-back or intrusive narrative at the end, allowing viewers to savor the film a second time while tying up all of the loose threads that slip past the first time.  Watch it twice... fans of good stories, well-told, won't be disappointed by this unassuming gem.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Great &#34;passtime&#34; brain game. Just love it when I get to the higher levels and have to use my higher thinking skills to &#34;fling&#34; the furrballs to successfully make it to the next level. If you really get stuck along the way, it will give you a few clues to help you figure out your next move.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Was sick over the holidays and must try and reread this book again . Will rerate this book at that time .
B007PPE086|5.0|Great toy, my step daughter was thrilled to see one in black and white. This is a great addition to any girl that is into monster high dolls.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I would sooooooo recommend this to fans of a good family mystery drama!!! Grabbed me from the start and I didn't want to stop reading.  Very surprising twists and turns throughout to keep your interest!!!  ENJOYED!!!!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is quite worth the cost for it, it is just one of the apps that is just important to have, and wort the price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Beautifully written and a definite page turner. Cannot wait to get my hands on the next one. Excellent character development
B006O6F932|5.0|Great toy for the girls that are into monster high dolls. The only thing that i didnt like so much was all the little pieces that come with it. other than that I have nothing bad to say about this playset, it folds up small enough to put everything away, would be nice to have a little storage case that would come with it to put all the extra small pieces in .
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Maybe you will not be entirely convinced by Richard Dawkins' arguments, but he tries very hard and almost gets there. I will be choosing more of his books and am glad Amazon has a lot them in stock.
B00AKS656U|5.0|This game is just another one with Garfield and Odie. It's worth playing because it's pretty sweet. I think it was worth the price. I encourage anybody who likes Garfield.
B000M39HB8|4.0|This was the sharpest quality movie I have ever seen.This is a copy of the original uncut black & white version. I have been told, it is better than the newer cut version in color.  I like this movie better than &#34;White Christmas&#34;!  Crosby & Astaire are fantastic together & Marjorie Reynolds is so pretty & talented. I can never find this movie on T.V. at Christmas time. If they show it, definitely must be during the night. I decided to purchase it for my birthday.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Really like this one,Will Ferrell is excellent and the rest of the cast is as well!  We like all the &#34;traditional&#34; movies, but also like thrones that make us laugh.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Excellent. Heavy duty and worked great on my V-Strom. Secures my Garmin GPS very well and does not move at all. Great.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This is a lot like the original, which I love but it is hard to steer on the Kindle. Otherwise, a good game.
B006O3MU96|3.0|Played for about 15 minutes. For me personally, pretty boring. I might attempt some more play at a later date.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Cousin Eddie, nothing more needs to be said!  Combine him with Snot and the Griswalds and this is one we watch every year!
B000028U0Y|4.0|Being the youngest of 4 siblings I have great memories of this album being played by my older Brother. It is not only a great memory but listening to the music in my fifties is a great reminder that there is so much great music out there to be explored.I will be starting  a new section in my music library for Mr. Cash. with future purchases of his music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Although this is not my reading style, can't wait to read book 3!  Really a great read for all ages.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Growing up as an 80s kid, TRON was just one of those weird, epically Geeky moments you were ashamed of yourself a little for loving.  As an adult, I LOVE IT.  This made me happy, as did all of the special features did.  Great product!  END OF LINE!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun for all of us. My youngest does the easier levels and I do the 8 's and above.  My teenager and I race each other to see who will finish first.  It's addictive.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read a lot of the Jack Reacher novels but this one didn't hold my interest.  I was disappointed in the story, not explaining his battered face, didn't have the action of previous novels.  I thought it was just me not liking the storyline but lent it to a few others and they didn't like it either.  All said it wasn't that interesting.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Sweet, funny, feel good movie.  I watch it every year.  Always makes me feel good.  Wonderful performances from perfect ensemble cast.
1932735410|5.0|Having just passed the PMP exam on December 28, 2012, I can give you a fresh perspective based on my use of this book for passing the exam. I am the project manager for awareness campaigns, but my knowledge of PMI's thoughts on how to go through project management were not overly developed prior to studying for this exam. So I would say I was starting from the beginning for the more detailed processes like risk management. I used Rita's book and the PMBOK Guide exclusively for four months. My study habits included reading through Rita's book fully once and taking the chapter practice tests, reading highlighted portions of the book the second time around and repeating some of the exercises in each chapter, and the third time around skimming each chapter for my problem areas and retaking the practice exams. During my second go through the book I also read through the 4th edition PMBOK Guide. The PMBOK really helped me with inputs and outputs and Rita's book is great for those of us who are trying to get better in project manager and pass the exam on the first try.<br /><br />Overall, I really don't have any cons for this book because I didn't look at any other books and I passed and passed WELL. The woman printing my results at the testing site told me she was impressed. I was surprised (re: overjoyed), she administers these tests every day and didn't really seem like the cheerleading type. However, please note the following are NOT INCLUDED IN BOOK: Rita does not include quality/grade and accuracy/precision, so make sure you get that knowledge. I did a quick google search online when I realized that was missing (from my online course) and I was fine after that. I loved the content, her conversational style, and thus, I actually ENJOYED studying on the train, during lunch and home. I spent approximately 4.5 hours a day on this book from September - December (with a few skipped days to enjoy life) and left no exercise incomplete. I also took three practice exams the week of the exam (I don't recommend this, but I was rushing) not affiliated with this author and that definitely tied everything together for me. I scored 72 on the first exam, 68 on the second, and 77 on the third practice exam. It helps!<br /><br />Key Points:<br />1) Do the practice exams. The hardest one turned out to be Communications for me and that's my actual job field! I scored in the 50s the first time on that particular chapter and the 80s the second time. I scored in the 70s and 80s with a couple of high 60s on the other chapters the first time around. I was scoring in the mid- to high- 80s by my last read through the chapters and PMBOK Guide.<br />2) Memorize what she tells you to memorize<br />3) Take practice exams not affiliated with Rita's product. I didn't buy fast track - there are plenty of good free exams online. This was the tipping point I believe for helping me see how draining a four-hour test can be if you're not used to sitting that long.<br />4) Don't read everything out there. I think it's unnecessary and can be confusing. I trusted the author when she advised against that and I think it helped me focus on her book and the PMBOK without worry (I get sidetracked very easily).<br />5) Do ALL of the exercises in Rita's book and really try to understand why you got the questions wrong in her practice exams and commit those reasons to memory. It really helps you understand the PMI way of thinking for the exam.
B00125JP1C|5.0|the greatest action film ever clive is ggrrrt!! in this one has comedy drama and best of all!!! none stop action!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I liked this book not because I love the writing style of John green but because when I read what the book was about, it was on topics a lot of people don't like to talk about; cancer and death. It was written beautifully enough that we could walk in the footsteps of those who have had cancer but also give us room to imagine a greater story for them. The characters are lovable and unforgettable. Definitely going  on to being one of my fave books along with looking for Alaska!
B000YPUF9W|5.0|For this item to be used, it showed good without skips. But I enjoyed it anyway. I Enjoy Resident Evil Movies.

B008H6GHL0|5.0|The movie was good. I jumped a couple of times. I thought UltraViolet Digital Copy was going to be apart of the dvd, but I didn't receive it.
B0095R64AO|1.0|You would think that this movie would be funny or at the very least romantic, it does not meet either criteria.  Don't waste your money or time on this horrible movie.
B003UBTX72|5.0|You will find this book nearly impossible to set down.  I was slightly depressed upon finishing it, as I wanted it to go on and on, as Keith does in real life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is by far the best in the series. Such amazing characters and plot line. The ending is superb and I want to read this book forever.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I ordered this on Amazon because my Verizon Fios didn't hav the first 3 episodes on On Demand.  Amazon is the best.  I'm not sure why I even have cable right now. This show is amazing. I definitely recommend this show!

B005COO1X6|5.0|I won't wax poetic... King is the master of the short story/ novella. A great story with all the elements we come to expect from King, yet the stories remain fresh and enticing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game. It is very interesting and keeps my interest. If someone likes games I would recomend this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In the movie Katniss didn't seem to care so much for Peers as she did in the book. She was more mercenary and did what ever needed to survive.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Magnificent. I couldn't stop reading it, suspense around every corner ,cannot wait to read the next book. Recommended to everyone
B008Y1YJZY|3.0|Interesting new take on traditional Christmas stories, with good 3d and animation. Note that it is an English/American collaborative production, and the writing and humor definitely seems to lean on the dry British side, much like Wallace and Grommit. I also picked up on a couple of lines that might be a tiny bit ethinically objectionable (stereotyping) in the US market. But overall it's a good addition to your holiday film library.
B0002YLC24|5.0|My husband saw this movie once on TV and he had been wanting to see it again, so I looked this up and lo and behold I found it on Amazon!!  He watches it all the time!! And I also bought the other series of this movie.
0525953728|5.0|I'm only half way though, but I really like the book so far. The book arrived on time and was well packaged to prevent damage. Can't ask for more than that.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I choose this rating because this story tells you more than just a teens life. It tells you of a mix of classic, comedy, romance and drama, which is hard to find nowadays in the young adult section. This story will shock and entertain the classic mind.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie blew me away. It's more than a movie about autism. It's a movie about what it means to be human. Claire Danes is her usual genius.  Must watch this movie, truly inspirational.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|It's a delightful Christmas album. It really does get you in the mood for Christmas. I like everything about it. Michael has a way of making all of the original songs his own. I highly recommend it to everybody.
B00005JM02|2.0|I bought this and it said &#34;like new&#34;.  When i recieved it the case was broken. the outside of the case had holes in it and busted and the inside of the case would not hold the disk and it was just sliding around inside it.  The disk was scratched and had to have it buffed to work.  Not satisfyed with discription of product.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I have seen great reviews on this book, and it is part of our reading for my book club.  Although the reading is somewhat interesting, I could not connect with the author's story.  Some moments were introspective, but most times I was just trying to get through the pages.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried a lot of bible apps and this one is the best that I have found. I like the plans that you can use and the fact that you can use audio.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is a laugh out loud family movie and if you have enjoyed the other Ice Age movies this is a must see also!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I loved this app since my mother my sister and me started playing it. good waste of a few min.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Very good collection of stories that were hard to put down.  I hope Mr. GRISHAM will consider doing this again.
1451695195|4.0|The book was quite thought provoking and at times got a little hard to understand due to medical terms.  The bottom line is he really feels he has been threre and the story has a surprise twist on the end.
B0092G1O8A|4.0|I thought \\"the Hunger Games\\" was a pretty good flick...good enough to buy on DVD and to read the books (which I think are fantastic).<br /><br />From just watching the movie, I agree that the movie draws on a lot of different sources for plot:<br /><br />-\\"The Lord of the Flies\\" (William Golding) (children killing or trying to kill each other in a wild place)<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307281701 Lord of the Flies]]<br /><br />-\\"The Running Man\\" (Stephen King) (a game show centering around people killing each other)<br /><br />[[ASIN:0451197968 The Running Man]]<br /><br />-\\"The Truman Show\\" (a whole \\"world\\" being created for the purpose of a \\"reality\\" show)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005DNPKSQ The Truman Show]]<br /><br />-\\"The Lottery\\" (Shirley Jackson) (a drawing to determine who will be \\"sacrificed\\")<br /><br />[[ASIN:0871292645 The Lottery]]<br /><br />-\\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" (Richard Connell) (a life and death contest where people hunt each other in the forest)<br /><br />[[ASIN:1478256982 The Most Dangerous Game]]<br /><br />-\\"Battle Royale\\" (Koushun Takami) a Japanese novel which has students being forced to fight each other to the death<br /><br />[[ASIN:156931778X Battle Royale]]<br /><br />-\\"The Naked Prey\\" (a great \\"being hunted in the wilderness\\" movie starring Cornel Wilde)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008GJUOGC The Naked Prey]]<br /><br />North Korea (because the country is rather the same as Panem in that you have a rich \\"capitol\\" and impoverished outlying regions...kind of like Pyongyang)<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385523912 Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea]]<br /><br />\\"Rollerball\\" (the 1975 version...where a brutal bloodsport serves a political purpose)<br /><br />[[ASIN:0792838300 Rollerball]]<br /><br />\\"Schindler's List\\" (not so much because of the plot but more the style of scene where the \\"reaping\\" takes place...it reminded me of the scene where all the Jews arrived in the Cracow Ghetto)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0068FYZIO Schindler's List (Universal's 100th Anniversary)]]<br /><br />So it's pretty obvious that \\"the Hunger Games\\" is not exactly original.  But that doesn't mean it's plagiarism and it certainly doesn't mean it's not a good story.  Let's face it, human beings have been coming up with stories for thousands of years...I suspect there are very few truly original ones left to be discovered.<br /><br />And sometimes, a derivative work can be \\"creation\\" because it synthesizes old things in a new and satisfying way.  That's what \\"the Hunger Games\\" does.  It's just a good story with:<br /><br />-Jennifer Lawrence doing well as Katniss, the melancholy but brave heroine<br />-a good turn by Stanley Tucci as the smarmy \\"talk show host\\" in the story<br />-some excellent action sequences and special effects<br />-a very interesting rendition of \\"the Capitol\\" and its garishly attired and styled inhabitants<br />-Woody Harrelson playing an interesting winner of the games who helps Katniss (proving that while Harrelson is a lunatic, he can act)<br />-a poignant and believable conclusion<br /><br />The story does have some holes in the plot...<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />1.  I find myself wondering whether the professional tributes would form the alliances that they did in the story.  Given the fact that there can only be one winner, I think in real life people would be afraid to turn their backs on each other.<br /><br />2.  The story sort of came to an abrupt end \\"forced\\" more or less by the introduction of the CGI dogs.  I just didn't think they belonged in the story or looked too convincing.<br /><br />(Having read the books, I know now that mutant critters were a principal weapon of the Capitol but I think they need to improve these creations for the future movies).<br /><br />3.  I had a sort of similar reaction to the landmines.  Given that the tributes weren't allowed to have firearms, it was kind of odd that they had anti-personnel mines, and I thought the idea that Katniss would be able to detonate them by shooting open a bag of fruit was a bit contrived.<br /><br />4.  The way the Hunger Games ran did not make much sense as an event a lot of people would take interest in.<br /><br />-It would seem like that having kids as young as 12 competing against those 18 years old would be kind of stupid.  If you had a smaller age range, the tributes would be more evenly matched and that would make better \\"entertainment.\\"<br /><br />-I couldn't see people tuning into watching more than a \\"highlights\\" reel of the Hunger Games, given the fact that a huge amount of what took place in the forest would hardly be cinematic.  I think watching it would be akin to watching all of the OJ Simpson murder trial in terms of being excruciatingly boring.<br /><br />5.  The scene early in the games where Katniss got \\"treed\\" by the career trackers (and Peeta) showed the career trackers with the bow and arrows came awfully close to hitting her twice, and then they just gave up?  Why wouldn't they have kept on shooting at her (in the book, that problem was taken care of with making the careers hopeless with the bow).<br /><br />6.  Josh Hutcherson does a good job playing Peeta, but I think they should not have him shown in the future movies with his hair combed back because he looked so different (at least to me) that I was confused at first if this was a different character.<br /><br />&lt;spoilers end><br /><br />But all of these plot holes don't sink \\"the Hunger Games.\\"  It's a good solid piece of entertainment that has more heart and soul than most action flicks, and I figure when the next installment rolls out next November, I'll go see it.open a bag of fruit was a bit contrived.<br /><br />4.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read it three times! I recommend it to everyone my sister my friends my mom my dog everyone!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great pastime on these Pennsylvania cold winter day after the driveway has been cleared.  Cheaper than those that use real coins, and can be continued later as time permits.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading all the hunger games books I love how in the end Katniss is able with PETA to make a life for herself with children in district12
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo! E-mail account/password recovery is awful at best, with poor repetitive cookie-cutter e-mails that they send you to keep you going in circles. Thumbs down.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|The original TV series met my expectations completely.  There was a bit of damage to the first season  DVD  holder that protects the DVDs, no damage to the DVDs themselves.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the game except for the power plays. You can still have loads of them and it won't let you use them if you're out of any type. I'm stacked with one particular one and it drives me nuts!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a realistic view on what could in fact  happen.  The realism on how something like this really could happen is scary.
B008X9Z3UC|2.0|It was what I wanted; just a simple zip case, but the craftsmanship is shoddy.  Some of the seams are crooked, the fit is so tight that the tablet only fits in upside down and the zipper rubs the corners. It would have been fine at a lower price, I'd say seven bucks, but twenty is way too much.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|My grandaughter is happy grandma got his movie on the kindlr for her. Perfect movie for he whole family to enjoy

B007FJFDXS|5.0|Very entertaining, easy way to spend a couple of spare minutes, gets challenging after the first couple of levels, would buy again
B000002GWN|5.0|A long time ago, this album was broadcast on the radio and I taped it. I listened to it a lot and really enjoyed it. I eventually bought the album and a few more Joni Mitchell albums as well.  I never really had listened to Joni Mitchell before and probably wouldn't have if it hadn't been for that broadcast, being the Led Zepplin fan that I was at the time. Listening to it is like being at a intimate concert.  The sound quality is good and and the backing band is in fine form.  This deserves a place in your music collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book keeps you guessing if Katniss will get through the games. Not for young readers.<br />Have enjoyed the first two books.  Looking forward to the next one.

B001F12J0C|5.0|I have seen the Bourne Trilogy as many times as it has been shown on T.V.  What can I say, I do love it.
B008M36ER0|4.0|very good movie, good action, and somewhat good story. not worth a purchase but worth a rent. you have to see this if you have not already.
031618201X|5.0|Its pretty much how the book describes it. The drawings are good and the story stands without loosing its touch.<br />Really nice<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who loves the original books and like a little bit of fantasy
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I had so much hope for this movie.  The trailers were hilarious and I LOVE Seth McFarlane.  But, sadly, the ONLY funny parts were in the trailers.  Save your money for when it comes on cable.  I'm really glad I didn't pay to see it in the theaters.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was a great book to read . I love this series of books they are great books for kids.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I liked the book but after hearing all the hoopla about The Hunger Games, I expected more. I am disappointed about the end.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Christmas Carol is a classic that I think everyone should read. It will change the view on which many people see Christmas. It will also give even the most stingy person the Christmas spirit.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  Jaws is my favorite movie of all time and the new Blu-Ray treatment is phenomenal.  It is so crystal clear and the colors so true, you feel like you are watching an entirely new movie.  I just loved it!
B00351YEVC|5.0|I THINK THAT THIS BOOK SHOULD BE ON EVERY SCHOOL READING LIST. TRULY BRILLIANT. CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. SUPERBLY WRITTEN.  I LIVED EVERY MOMENT WITH BRUNO AND SHMUEL.  UNBELIEVABLY GOOD IN EVERY WAY.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I fully enjoyed the story and am looking forward to reading the rest of the books. I would recommend this book to anyone... but have to give credit to my daughter for recommending it to me :)

B00A7CI82I|4.0|I felt the movie started a bit slow, but once it got going, it was non-stop action.  I realize they needed time to set up how Aaron Cross fits into the Bourne mythology.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I just going to say that I hope that my 17 year old daughter, finds her a boy just like Holder; Oh! MY HEART! that would be a peace of mind.<br /><br />This was a beautiful story. Very eloquentand and executed with so much maturity and wisdom . it is a beautiful, heartbreaking, story.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love the game but it is not free it costs three dollars to buy it is fun though worth the money.I just wish I had the money.

B004FEL6GO|4.0|the toy was a little bit smaller than what I imagined, however, the material is decent and my kid was thrilled to have it,, that's what matters :)
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|If you're a fan of the stage musical, my advice is to see the movie first BEFORE listening to this highlights album.  Otherwise, you're bound to be disappointed as comparisons to the soundtrack of the stage musical will be inevitable.  The film soundtrack is a body of work that is separate from the staged production.  The orchestrations for the film mirror that of the 2010 revised orchestrations that were done for the 25th anniversary of the stage production.<br /><br />Not much additional effort has been put into this CD.  It's simply the audio track from the film in a CD format background sound effects and all.<br /><br />The score is lush in places, however you can easily tell it was recorded on a sound stage and not a recording studio.  While you get the rawness of the film performances, it comes at the price of sound quality.<br /><br />Several key songs have been edited (a verse removed here, a chorus removed there) to allow this highlights package to fit onto a single CD.<br /><br />This is still a decent effort though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was full of twists and turns. It kept me on the edge if my seat and I  never wanted to put it down! Best book in the trilogy in my opinion.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|Let's be honest, none of us were watching this expecting Citizen Kane.  It delivered on what it promised.  Good storyline, hot men, and awesome dance scenes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book that is hard to put down :)<br />You will laugh out loud and it will make you sad but most of all it will make you feel appreciative of the good life
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Love the gun, wish it came with more darts and enough clips to fill all the slots. Had to buy additional ammo and additional clips. I now have the clips that hold 18 darts and It rains darts upon my co-workers with their measly six-shooters.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|great game very fun and entertaining love playing it great way to spare some time really enjoy it. one of my very favorite games

B000HKW7E0|3.0|We had a older copy (made for television) an decided to upgrade our library with a Blu Ray version.  I was shocked at the rank language and sexual innuendos in this version. This is not appropriate for smaller children
B000EF5NAS|5.0|One of my favorite all time moves.  And Fried Green Tomatoes (to eat) are great too  (I found that in the book).  Rene
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The writing is so original and clever, the casting is so spot on, the staging is perfect......No wonder it didn't sell to the American public......Maybe if Betty White had been cast........
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Quick paced, funny yet romantic.  While the premise is a bit unrealistic, it was an enjoyable story that kept my interest.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|A very good story.  I find some of Michael Connelly books a little hard to read - this is not one of them I thoroughly enjoyed this from the first page to the end.  Thanks.
B00A135YUW|5.0|Keeps with the tone of her previous album.  Lyrics are easy to understand and enjoy the story that she is telling.  Good sound.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|This item seems very durable. I bought it for my 8-year old's Kindle Fire and she loves it. Great price.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this app to monitor my power usage and to easily see how much battery I had left. I got much more than expected...I like the time estimates and the visualizations but I especially like the historical graphing which helped me identify the most effective charger for my tablet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an easy version of Solitaire to download and learn. I am new to Kindle Fire HD and this is a good game to start with.
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|His name is Brandon and he is a sex addict.  He spends virtually his entire waking life either having sex, planning on having sex, or watching others have sex.<br /><br />How he got to be this way is never fully explained in the screenplay by Steve McQueen (who also directed the movie) and Abi Morgan, though it is darkly hinted that it might have something to do with some form of sexual abuse in the character's past.  This is particularly likely given the unhealthy proclivity he seems to have for his even more lost and dysfunctional sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who comes to live with him in his Manhattan penthouse early on in the movie.  Brandon will do it with just about anyone - though he seems to have drawn the line at Sissy, at least based on the struggling and angst he undergoes in her presence, though we`re never quite sure about what might have happened between the two of them in the past.  Of course, the fact that Brandon is sexy and handsome means he's never at a loss for willing and attractive partners.  It is also no surprise that the one woman (Nicole Beharie) who actually gets into his head and possibly even his heart - a co-worker who thinks there should be more to relationships than mere one-night stands - is the one for whom he is unable to perform in the only way he knows how.<br /><br />\\"Shame\\" is a subtle and provocative drama that explores how sex and sexuality have changed in the modern era - in some ways for the better and in many ways for the worse.  Certainly Brandon and Sissy demonstrate some of the pitfalls inherent in a world where sex is so readily available, thanks in large part to advancements in technology, the proliferation of porn, and relaxed social mores.

It presents us to them in all their physical and emotional nakedness, then lets us render our own judgment on them - or lack thereof.<br /><br />In a brave and soul-baring performance, Michael Fassbender brings a rawness and a vulnerability to the role of Brandon that allow us to feel for the character without ever begging for our pity.

B00A77II0U|5.0|Loves this game. One of the only games I have ever played through. Occasionally it may have started to seem.repetitive but almost at that exact moment a puzzle would come in to play or a cut scene ..definitely would recommend. Worth the money
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Cant look back at older posts.  I also cant repost things it always says my link cannot be found.  Please fix.  until then I wont be using this app
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is another game that I like to play. I want to play it all the time. I have a lot of fun playing it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson were amazing. I've never seen Skylar Astin perform before, but he does not disappoint. This movie had me alternating between dancing and singing and laughing.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Love this movie. If you like musicals and the bohemian life, then you should see and/or own rent. The soundtrack is amazing and I love the casting choices! Get it!
0788859544|5.0|I watched this 100's of times as a young girl and bought it this year for my 4 year old daughter who is infatuated with Ariel and anything else mermaid.  We all LOVED it and it has already been watched at least 20 times.
1451629192|4.0|A few reviews criticise the author which I don't really understand.Sure there are times where I wonder if she's still being sexually assaulted or if the girls have been assaulted and when she's talking of things I wonder how old the girls are at this point ... But she states right from the beginning that the book is like that....<br /><br />However considering her age, education and all she's been through I think the book is well written... Well written enough that I read it in the space of 24 hours.<br /><br />Jaycees story and perspective has helped me understand a little about a friend of mine whom often feels paralysed and has dealt with life long abuse in a similar way. I think it has a lot to do with her shy persona and self esteem before the abuse or abduction.<br /><br />Above all the fact Jaycee refuses to hold hate in her heart for her captors is amazing.... And inspiring.
0525423656|5.0|have read Matched, the 1st of the series. finishing another book before diving into this sequel. Arrived quickly and in great condition
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this just opens the browser. nothing special to get excited about or to find useful. I am disappointed that they wont invest time
B000HT3PPG|5.0|So many parts are so GOOD, that it's a 'classic'.  If you have other favorite 'Christmas movies', check this one out - it will joint the list in all probabiity.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I enjoyed the last installment of the Dark Knight series; but honestly, it wasn't as good as the second movie. I found Bane to be silly instead of scary. Enjoyed the caustic Catwomen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and so dose my BF so it was a good app to get on my Kindle Fire but I would not recommend this for small screens :)
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Listening to these tracks brings back the images from this wonderful musical.  Am sure other voices from the stage may be stronger in some instances, but having seen the play and the movie, I have to say that the movie colors in the details and makes the story more alive.  I feel that live-recording the songs as the actors carried out their roles, gave much more emotion and nuance to the story.  A stage production set to film would have been just that..seeing the story from afar.  It would not have been nearly as compelling.  That being said, I can see where some reviewers might be disappointed.  It helps to have these vivid images in your head as you listen--having the context of the scene explains why there are certain pauses and extraneous sounds.  Eddie Redmayne was a real stand-out in this production in both his acting and singing.  I hope that he receives the recognition for this performance.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Not hard to realize why Julia Roberts moved into the &#34;serious actress&#34; category with this true strory.  The rest of the cast is also good.  An enjoyable movie!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Got this at a great price for my dad for Christmas.  He's a big IJ fan and has been spending his time watching all the behind the scenes.  Great gift!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love doing puzzles and this app has lots of pretty puzzles plus differing degrees of difficulty. It's just like completing real puzzles.
B00A757EFW|2.0|The game itself is fun and works well on a kindle fire, but I had the free version and it only allows you to play 2 screens before it ends your game by asking you to buy the ap. It really wasn't enjoyable enough to use to make me want to pay for it.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|I really liked the mix of what I think is &#34;dub-step&#34; and r&b, with a little bit of old fashioned Michael Jackson. At least that is what I hear when I'm grooving to this album. Plus, dude is pretty harsh with his lyrics, which is a unique surprise for what I thought was a crooner.<br />Love this album.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very addicting time waster.  Be warned...minutes turn into hours with this game. Sometimes you are so close to completing level then you run out of time...and have to keep on playing until you complete it.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is a great CD. Phillip Phillips has a very unique sound and there is a truth in his lyrics and a purity in his voice,
B007FJFDXS|1.0|I couldn't figure out how to really make the cube move. Not my game apparently. Deleted it within a few minutes.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I like sci-fi thrillers a lot but this one was mediocre and very predictable at best. Kind of a waste of time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the book, I don't understand the notion that it's a teen age girl book, I'm a 40 year old dad and husband and I enjoyed it.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|This product isn't what i expected. It doesn't seem to be in a upper grade for what i'm paying for.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Really great game, even better on a tablet then Wii. Really addictive, need more games like this made available. Awesome
B007MU85D0|5.0|I heard Little Talks on the radio and was curious to hear more so I listened to this album on Spotify. I was hooked. I listened and listened and was pleased to see this on sale for such an awesome collection of music.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|We LOVE this movie.  The animation is superb and the story line is not bad.  If you're looking for something that's light, this is your movie.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|I have read the Martian Series many times. I was ten or so when I read the series for the first time. I have enjoyed the books since first reading them. Just had the displeasure of seeing this movie for the first and last time. Long story short, this movie is very poorly done. The writing, acting, story are silly. What a waste of great base material.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. It gives me something to do. On the game I feel like I have to win because if I don't  Om num gives you a sad look. Which really intimidates me to want to win!
B002UD56I6|4.0|I saw &#34;This is It&#34; at the cinema and finally decided to get it on Blu-ray. The disc had no scratches and played perfectly. Just awesome!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is a great game to play on the go.  I love it and I've just started playing it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was very impressed. This was the first hidden object game I tried on my Fire. The graphics are awesome!  I have games on my PC that are not as good. The story is pretty good. Give it a try!
1596434252|5.0|Excellent book which my niece loves, great value and top notch pop ups. Would highly recommend as a Birthday or Christmas gift
B007RX32TY|5.0|Any album which starts with one of the most sumptuous Neil Young covers you are going to hear of \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the black)\\" and finishes nearly 80 minutes later with a 14 minute plus of Brian Eno style ambience in the closing track \\"No escape\\" must have something going for it. Indeed it is mighty pleasing to report that Chromatics \\"Kill for love\\" on the \\"Italians Do It Better\\" label is undoubtedly one of the best things released in 2012 even though its gestation starts as far back as 2007 with the album a full five years in the making. The ambition police perhaps could criticize this band from Portland Oregon for the sheer audacity and scale of this album but within its grooves are shades of the Cocteau Twins, New Order, House Music, Italian Disco and any of the Heinz 57 varieties of electronica you can imagine. The band consists of the shimmering vocals of Ruth Radelet (vocals/synthesizer), Adam Miller (guitar/vocoder), Nat Walker (drums/synthesizer), and resident genius Johnny Jewel (producer, multi-instrumentalist). On one level you could argue that \\"Kill for love\\" neatly splits into two parts with the album comprising five big electronic instrumentals with more pop orientated synth music, but that would be too simple. After repeated plays the listener realizes that this smorgasbord of songs do have unifying themes and that despite the presence of a guitar on the cover it's the waves of pulsating musical landscapes and imagery that are the real core of the album.<br /><br />The Neil Young cover highlighted above shines light onto the wonder of Radelet's vocals with the superb backing of instrumentation of Jewel colouring it in with fitting backdrop. It is arguable that the first six songs on \\"Kill to love\\" including the New Order sounding beauty of the title track, the epic \\"Back from the grave\\", the icy dance music of \\"Lady\\" and especially the near nine minute electronic sweet and sour menace of \\"These streets will never look the same\\" amount to the best opening to a rock album since the year dot. It is simply dazzling stuff, truly modern sounds for modern days. These songs set the bar so high that nothing can really touch them although the band try at every possible opportunity. Thus \\"Running for the sun\\" starts out with haunting piano coda and moves into a longing vocoder infused ballad that is well worth a download for the uninitiated. The beautiful love song \\"Bird of Paradise\\" should melt the coldest of winter hearts while the ghost of Kraftwerk are evoked the excellent instrumental \\"The River\\". Listeners would also profit seeking out some of the other instrumentals recorded by this band not least the brilliant backing to Ryan Gosling's neo-noir crime drama film \\"Drive\\" namely the menacing threat of \\"Tick of the clock\\". The fantastic \\"Broken Mirrors\\" on this album reprises some of these soundscapes.<br /><br />The review site Music OMH has described \\"Kill for love\\" has having \\"a My Bloody Valentine grandeur.... but executed primarily with electronics; guitars present, but phased and treated\\". There is something in this as it is one of those records whose gravitational is magnetic to the listener and it stands as a piece of work which requires detailed exploration and forensic examination while at the same time it descends down your musical burrow and chivvy's you out like an old stoat (apologies to E. Waugh). It's pleasing at the end of 2012 reviewing season to conclude a varied musical year dominated by veteran performers with a band who have also paid their musical dues in full and delivered in spades. \\"Kill for love\\" is a handsome and stylish record full of pristine sounds and intriguing rhythms. Johnny Jewel is a full blown composer scoring movie soundtracks, with a proper understanding of tension versus release and in \\"Kill for love\\" he and his band have unleashed a huge polished diamond.opening to a rock album since the year dot.

B006ZS4U8Y|5.0|Gift for my great grandson. He put it together in 2hours. Of course he's a expert as he has so many Lego sets.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I already had the first release and wanted extra footage.  The extra discs were great for added information and the additional footage at the beginning of the movie helps explain more.

B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is all movie, no gag reel, deleted scenes, or extras.  I was looking for the same movie that I had seen as a child.  This is it, just as it was shown at the movie theater.  Great, old fashioned musical.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and can play it for hours.  The thing that I do not like is the fact that the screen freezes up on me once in a while.  Being it is a timed game that becomes frustrating and irritating to me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|THIS IS A Great and funny book and I say Jeff Kinney/ did it once more. AND I CAN WHAT FOR the next BOOK
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I personally think this is one of Christina's best albums, and I love Back to Basics. Her duet with Blake Shelton on this album should be at the top of both country and pop charts. Incredible voice. The CDs were  shipped Prime and got here on my doorstep in two days. Hard to beat that.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it so much fun to read and so cute on a little boy trying to get a date to the dance.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This is a game I loved as a child in the arcade.  It is fun to play.  Some time the ball is hard to move and control.  I don't know if it is the game or the tablet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You will cry, you will laugh, and you will cry some more. The story is a mesh of life, love, and gripping tragedy. It will tear at your heart and patch it back together better than before.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a GREAT deal because you get four versions of the movie for essentially every device you have and for a great price. PLUS, I pre-ordered this and the price dropped so Amazon refunded part of my money and gave me the lower price....that was pretty darn cool.
