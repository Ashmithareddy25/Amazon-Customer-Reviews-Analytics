B004XVMCMQ|3.0|It has been thirteen years since this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel MANSFIELD PARK was made and while it may not be the most successful of the renderings of the Austen story it continues to entertain, primarily because of the rather top-notch cast.  Patricia Rozema adapted the novel for the screen an din addition to supplying the dialogue and sequencing she also directed - and that is where the gap between true Austen sensibility and interpretation seems to meander.<br /><br />The story is well known, but a capsule synopsis may help underline the attributes of this version. Young Fanny Price (Hannah Taylor- Gordon) is a poor relative who is sent to live with Sir Thomas Bertram (the now deceased Harold Pinter), the husband of her aunt. She is a typical Austen female - wise, clever, a fine writer - and bonds with Sir Thomas' youngest son Edmund (Philip Sarson). As the children move toward adulthood Fanny (now Frances O'Connor) gains beauty and is the ideal for a neighbor Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola). Sir Thomas promotes the match only to find that Fanny is a liberated woman with a mind of her own: Fanny, not wanting to be a passive girl, makes Henry prove himself a proper suitor. The mature Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) is taken with Henry's sister (Embeth Davis).  The concept of New World slavery enters as the characters discover that Sir Thomas is financially involved with that trade and Sir Thomas's son Tom (James Purefoy) is obsessed with the concept. Of course, twists and turns abound and characters' true selves are revealed and the ending is a typical `all's well that end's well' dynamic.<br /><br />The cast is large with some of the other roles well enacted by Victoria Hamilton, Hugh Bonneville, Justine Waddell, Shelia Gish, Amelia Warner and others. A fine cast, beautifully costumed, well photographed, but somehow it just doesn't seem like pure Jane Austen. Grady Harp, January 12
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game have a good choice of games would recommend. it to others all of the games are great to play easy to earn points to unlock new games
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Love this ap, don't like clutter on my phone but devoted a whole page to the widgets for this one. Options are fantastic for customization by the menus can be a little confusing... Beautiful graphics.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I got this as a deal of the day for $4.12! Yes, FOUR DOLLARS! I am still in shock from coming back to this to review it and seeing that it is now $45! I didn't realize I got such a great deal. Anyway-I love this movie and they did a great job in transferring it to blu-ray. Very pleased!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|interesting concert for unlocking additional games. games are fun but some are difficult to control. wish you could earn more points on some
B0055SWM08|4.0|this game is fun and kinda soothing. its definetly worth 99&cent;. the music is very nice. it gets pretty tricky but is still a lot of fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is one of my favorites. you get 117 games in one. all of them are fun and addicting. download this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I've only had this for a couple of days, but its fun to have an app that doesn't get old after the first few plays! You can't beat the price either...
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Its a fun game to play when you have guests to entertain. Its great for people of all ages. You have to persuade people to help you win the game when you trade. Its make you want to really win. My cousins and I played it a lot and we got very competitive.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty good game, definitely something to waste some time with. Gets kind of dull after a while. But all in all, a pretty good deal for a free app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun and easy to play on the go.I enjoy playing yet it is easy to return to if you need to step away.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids live this game.  there are so many new games that it keeps you busy for a really long time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun to pass some time when you are bored. not real sure how the point system works though
B005HSL626|1.0|I got this app today and it is boring the adds r annoying and the game has no meaning and i would give it a zero star
B004EBT5CU|5.0|awesome!!! amazon is great to do business with.  i love this album.i will keep buying adele's music. i hope her health problems get better soon, so she can make another album.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|A page turner, definitely - I mean how can it not be when you are a famous, rich, rock star, doing tons of drugs, f'ing hot girls, and traveling all over the world.  He had some really great stories and experiences to share, but it always seemed that just when he was getting into a good story or describing some of his wisdom or insights, he would end the story/simplify the lesson or gravity of it all.  So, this bio lacked depth.  Although, overall, I do appreciate his honesty about everything he did, said - he really put down the good, bad, and ugly.  I had no idea he had suffered through so many years of all kinds of addictions - substances, love, codependency.  I think he has a lot to say - I wish he would say more.  I'm glad I didn't pay more than $7.63 for this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun beacause it is easy to get coins and there is a lot of variety in the games
0393338398|4.0|As usual Michael Lewis became part of the story he was writing. He lived with the Oakland baseball team and learned much about the personalities of those who ran the team. I was disappointed that the story took place ten years ago. I wonder if it is different now. I never realized how much trading takes place in baseball and that it can take place at any time in the season and for any reason after six years. I never really got into the book but found it interesting and well researched.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked the game but I some of the games are hard to pass. It still is a good game though, on the kindle fire!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great games with wide variety of choices to play only downfall have to pay a lot to open other games.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm not kidding this is so awesome and I also got the sesones and Rio pack for this aswell. That shows you how awesome Angry Bids are :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I don't like that you have to replay some games aa million times just to get points but most.of the games are great
B004EFYZ1C|2.0|Just installed the app. First thing I see is \\"waning gibbous\\" and \\"full moon in 15 hours\\". First statement should be \\"waxing gibbous\\". So the app is WRONG! Such a simple thing to get wrong!   There is no way (or at least no obvious way) to go back to \\"now\\" after you have touched the screen (which moves you to another time).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is lots of fun I had a great time playing it I think everyone should play this game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so cool!!!!  i cant stop playingggg want so many more games so i can unlock all of them and get so many pointsssssss
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|follow me on twirltter @leesutton1 and second of all great app works great on kindle fire just a coupple of graphicks issues
1451648537|3.0|Well written and interesting read. Purchased the Kindle version through Amazon. Excellent coverage regarding his overall personality, his career, accomplishments and failures.  However, very lacking regarding his personal relationships.  I desired to know more about this to better understand SJ.  Shocked to find nothing about how his adopted dad's death affected him since they were so close.  Shocked that his adopted sister Patti was hardly mentioned. SJ did say he was never close to Patti but it doesn't say why.  Was she even interviewed for the book? Did she refuse to be interviewed? Many questions left unanswered. He was married to Laurene for some 20 yrs. and you gain very little insight into their relationship. Still, I enjoyed the book and just hope that someone else will come out with a book that sheds more light on what it was like to live with the man, as no one really knows you like the people who live with you.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|worst application and support ever.  even after all the reviews stating they have the wrong amount for days for January they still have not updated or fixed the issue.  When developers take so little pride in their work you should look somewhere else before wasting your money on this piece of junk.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Liked the first book a lot, but felt this book was repetitive in story sequence.  No twists that had me thinking \\"well, I didn't see that coming.\\"  I believe a moment like that is what makes a sequel truly brilliant.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lot's. of fun. you get addicted to this old time card game . not sure if u can play on line against people that would. be fun! !!!!!!
B000001OAA|4.0|People always say Garbage's self-titled debut is their best. Well, I've been listening to the album for two weeks now, but I strongly believe it's not. It's a really good album but, there few songs that shines. Lyrics are still stellar but the music develops better in Version 2.0 in my opinion with the addition of more electronica. Highlights of this album are \\"Vow\\", \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\", \\"Milk\\", \\"As Heaven Is Wide\\".
B004MC8CA2|3.0|its okay. I like the fact that its free. I am also enjoying the reading plans that come with it. I don't like the fact that it cant be magnified any larger but oyer than that its cool.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|101 in 1 games is a awesome game that everyone should have on their kindles. There are a lot of games.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I enjoyed my app.  It allowed me to call my home computer on skype.  Part of my daily free app special amazon had.  still even for 5 bucks it has some great uses.
B000HKYA1I|4.0|Very good narrative AND AESTHETICS  emotional but still uplifting and funny at the right moments.  Sun flowers and tears all lead to happiness.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this game except for the fact that you need to unlock the games which I wasn't expecting. but it is fun!(:
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|You can go to a lot of web sites that do this already for free.  my complaint is why anyone would pay for this in the first place.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|I just bought a new Panasonic Viera 3D tv and the only audio output on it is a digital one. Since i have a headset that requires analog I was unable to watch TV or play games with it until I purchased this unit. It's inexpensive, small, doesn't take up much room behind the TV and has worked perfectly so far.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's not an incredible product but a great product.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|I have heard many songs that are dedicated to pets but I have seldom heard a song about an animal like ZEBRA done so well. Zebra is the kind of song you will play for several days, months and through time and never once get bored. The video does justice too. It is my favourite song on this album and based on that song alone, one should check the album out AT THE VERY LEAST. Beach House's strong points are the vocals and the delivery. Sometimes when I listen to bands like PANDA BEAR I think they are trying to say something and sing but they never quite nail it like BEACH HOUSE does.<br /><br />USED TO BE is another one of my favourites. Never before have toddler bells for little children been put to better use. There is a dreamy landscaping wall of sound BEACH HOUSE delivers very beautifully, it's contagious listening.<br /><br />SILVER SOUL has a very-stop-ok-go and will take time to grow on you.<br /><br />REAL LOVE is an absolute epic song and maybe my second favourite song of the record.<br /><br />Overall the album takes a lot away from you, it is beautiful music best heard when with company or eyes closed on your bed with the ipod plugged deep into your ears.<br /><br />If you like this band - you must also listen to Wild Nothing.
0316098329|2.0|The book started out interesting enough; the premise in a nutshell is that Jack is a five year old boy that has grown up living in an 11'x11' room with just his \\"Ma\\". He knows nothing of the outside world, except what he sees on tv, which he understands isn't reality (at least, his reality). Ma was kidnapped when she was nineteen and held in captivity for seven years.   I read this book pretty quickly; it isn't a difficult read as it is written in Jack's point of view. The thing that gets me about Room is that it is extremely inconsistent. For example, he is a pretty precocious child; his sentence structures are atrocious, but he grasps words and concepts that are not common for a five year old. His use of \\"waterfalling\\" for pouring is annoying, and I don't understand how Ma didn't correct him for that when she does with his use of \\"brung\\" instead of \\"brought\\". I understand that he is repetitive, as many children his age are, but that doesn't make it less annoying.   ****SPOILER!!!****   The story, after the first twenty or so pages (giving the reader insight into the situation), seems to plateau until they make their escape; after that, they go through the integration process, and then it plateaus once again. I find that the flow of the book is choppy; the last half seems rushed. It makes no sense to me how, after Ma tries to commit suicide, a week later, they are allowed to go into assisted living on their own. It makes no sense to me that Jack continues to breastfeed. A lot of it doesn't make sense.   Room also seems kind of gimmicky to me. I really think that it would've been more interesting from Ma's point of view as opposed to Jack's. From what I understand, Ms Donaghue was paid in advance for the story that she hadn't even written. She was inspired by the Elisabeth Fritzl case. I think that Ms Donaghue changed some slight things about the story just so it wouldn't seem as if she were ripping off things out of the headlines, ie how Ma is kidnapped or insteadof being taken to the hospital, Jack has to pretend he is dead.   I understand that the material is very sensitive, and it is difficult to write from a child's point of view, especially trying to replicate his tone. However, I don't think that this is worthy of a Booker Prize nomination.   I feel the way about this book that I felt about Brady Udall's \\"The Lonely Polygamist\\": I wouldn't personally recommend it, but I wouldn't dissuade someone from reading it if they were really interested.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Actually saw this in the theater when it was originally released.  Even as an eight-year-old, I loved it. Now that I own the DVD, I STILL laugh at the deadpan jokes. Absolutely wonderful, funny, witty, smart story.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This is a very impressive app and great for planning star gazing, telescope use, or just enjoying the night sky.  To find uses for it tho' it is helpful if you are aware of your surroundings and have the mental capacity to enjoy them.  If your universe consists of the latest electronic devise or game, this app will be meaningless to you.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I can honestly this is one of Stephen kings better works. I never wanted it to end while I was reading it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game but I don't like how you have to earn points to unlock the other games. if you like that sort of thing then this game is for you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is not a lot to say other than I absolutely love this Bible app. I would reccomend it to anyone that desires to read and listen to God's Word!!
B005KPL7WK|5.0|cannot believe this talent. ben was born 1988, he's a year younger than me, and has the voice and mind of someone who has experienced it all (and smoked a pack or two along the way) cannot wait for the bands' presence in NYC- i'm sending playlists to all of my friends
B0063IH60K|4.0|same old fashion solitaire at your fingertips just annoying advertisements in between games. otherwise a great app. have fun playing were ever you desire.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is awesome. I only wish the mouse worked a little better for videogames or I could link without being on same network.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|simply thank you for the awesome app.  And people don't listen to all the morons that leave these dumb comments...
B003L77G6K|4.0|Since this is a blu-ray disc we expect several features to make more interesting the pleasure of watching this fabulous show, right? Well...this one lacks all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its an ok game. kinds slow on kindle but some mini games are fun. would recommend to waste time yup
B001GM28HO|5.0|Not since Madonna rocked my world back in the 80's & 90's has a pop diva grabbed my attention. The Fame is a great piece of work that made a mark in pop history. A must own!
B002GHHHP6|5.0|It's a fun movie enjoyable to watch with friends and family.  It is a kind of movie that you don't get tired of watching over and over.
1400049628|1.0|I couldn't make it through this book -- it was BORING.  I had assumed from the high ratings that it would be funny.  Now I know why Saturday Night Live is failing.  I have to research if I can \\"return\\" a downloaded Kindle.
0061714402|2.0|I'm a. Casual megadeath fan so to me this was mostly new info...I was surprised how boring it was. I think it must be how the book was written because it should be fascinating but it's not.  Plus there is only so much teenage psychology I could take. I went from casual fan (own a few of their Cd) to not a fan at all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far it is fun, have not had it very long. Some games are hard.  Looking forward to seeing what we unlock.
B004J47BNM|5.0|My favorite Drum and Bass (as well as other edm genres) album of all time.  Everyone I have showed this album to (probably over 50 people) have loved it.
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is a good product and shipping was fast. This item was a gift,not for me, but i really think that it's a usefull item.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Game is great but ad's are extremely irritating. Keep getting movie previews sometimes in the middle of a game.  Makes it hard to concentrate on game.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I like this game because it has really nice graphics and pretty node gameplay, but it needs more ri its as well as more arenas suchas the, &quot;professional&quot; arenas and more robots such as Twin Towers, Zeus, or even Atom, etc.
0062082353|1.0|His interview were he said that he punched Jesse Ventrua is a lie.  Watch for the lawsuits and Fox retractions. So one might come to the conclusion that this book is a  fairy tail NOVEL.  Following claims made by US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle that he punched Jesse Ventura for badmouthing US troops during a wake for a slain soldier in Coronado, California, Ventura has denounced the story as an outrageous lie, asserting that the event never happened.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is hard to believe that a game as good as this could be free with so many games to use surely this will give some good hours of fun.<br />I would like a paid version for 99 cents or so to remove the adds unicorn not all but more games. (just to keep the fun of unlocking them for yourself) as well as a good amount of points.<br />however good job Nortcurrent Ltd!
B005OKTPKC|3.0|Maybe I should have been traveling when reading The Litigators. Then there would have been enough distractions and with my mind mostly on other things, this book would have just spiced up my journey and been forgotten.  Unfortunately, I read it snug in bed. And I found it predictable from start to finish. It was a standard formula and if it hadn't been humorous, would have made me mad. No point summarizing the story. Guy gets into big trouble along with other guys and with 20% of the book left to go, everything miraculously and not very credibly, turns around. Everyone goes home happy.   Maybe I shouldn't have taken a Grisham thriller seriously.  But I've known nicer books from him. The Client, for example, is a favorite. The Confession, more recent, was also quite interesting. This one was legal fluff. Still! If the author is having fun, whom am I to get in the way!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|just downloaded this app and I can't put it down.  This will difinitely pass the time when I need it.  I just hope it does not drain my battery too fast.
1451648537|4.0|I got this book for my stepdad for Christmas and it turns out this was exactly what he wanted! The book looks very nice on the inside and outside. The tiny bit I read was very interesting. If you are interested in knowing who Steve Jobs was, I recommend this book. It also has lots of interesting pictures of Steve, his family, and his work.
0316044938|1.0|Bought it after watching the movie, hoping the gaping plot holes of the movie would somehow be solved by the book. Unfortunately the book and movie are pretty much identical.  1. Does  Sebold have something against cops? I mean, in this book, they couldn't find a child-killer if he walked right into the police station and confessed. Here we have a murderer, a creepy comb-over dude who lives in a fairly nice house with absolutely NO means of job or support, no wife, no kids, no family, classic loner, builds attractants like doll houses used to lure children such as a late famous entertainer did. And the cops don't put even one and one together. Creep uses the age old tactic of asking questions so he \\"can help investigate the crime\\" in order to see what the cops know. Even goes so far as \\"drawing a re-enactment of Susie's crime\\" which was taken by sister Lindsey and the cops actually believe him when he says he drew the crime scene to help catch the killer. Duh!   2. Wimpy father hears killer George call his late wife \\"Sophie\\" when on the police report he said her name was \\"Leah.\\" No cops followed up on that one. Duh!  3. If Susie's father was so sure George was the killer, why did he not invade George's house, tie him up, torture him until he got a confession? Why did Lindsey, knowing George heard and saw her in the house taking evidence, give said evidence to her pickled grandmother (in the movie it took sooo long!) while meantime George is racing to pick up evidence and skip out in his car. Susie's father should have been there in a heartbeat.(In the movie Lindsey's escape from the house is in fair weather, dry lawn. By the time the stupid cops get there, there's been a major SNOW STORM! How long does it take those stupid cops to get to a murder suspect's home????)  4. Waaaaay too much teen sex!! Susie cruising around in her little Heaven balloon watches her 14 yr old sister lose her virginity and is envious. I'd be FURIOUS! My little sister an unwed teen mom??? Mother even has a hot affair. I guess that's how you deal with a nightmare tragedy. Not to mention a raped, murdered, dismembered virgin girl coming back down for another teen-aged  romp in the sack. I think the spirit of an actual rape victim would run as far away from sex as she could for starters?  If it wasn't for all the head up a$$ characters in this book, maybe the serial killer George would have been caught ages ago. the book is grossly overwritten, Sebold wanting each and every sentence to be a poetic masterpiece that mostly ends up laughable. Each victim seems to have her own heaven, but they're all together in the same place(?)Sebold isn't just playing your heart strings, she yanking the hell out of them. I won't be reading any more of her books.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|really good but really bad.saints, pats, broncos, jets.  I I I I I I I I I I o i
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i really thought this app was cool. i dont understand the negative reviews about only getting a few games at first. it clearly says when u first open the app that you have to earn coins by playing to get more games opened. people need to pay attention.
B005CGI3ZG|3.0|I was overall satisfied with the purchase.  I wish the cd's would have been individually protected, they are all together and could get easily scratched.  I am most disappointed with the fact that the main song (Sarah McLachlan) isn't on this.  The music has been taken off.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game brings entertainment to my whole family I love this game.  plus it's free so you got nothing to lose
0385344325|5.0|I am such a fan of Lee Child.  I stumbled onto his books by accident and have never looked back!  I loved this book as I loved all the others.  Thank you, Lee Child, for keeping us so marvelously entertained!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book (though the majority of my friends didn't).  It's brilliant, captivating, and heart wrenching at times.  So much beauty in such a short series <3
B0059XTTW8|2.0|First, I am a person that prefers a good, compelling plot over a movie with big explosions. I just don't bother with those type of movies anymore unless action is truly integral to a good story. I knew going in that this was not a action flick and I had an idea of the gist of the plot.....and was looking forward to a good spy story but I didn't get it.   This movie is loaded with talent but for myself it failed because 1) it was confusing/difficult to follow, and 2) there is NO character development. I got to the point where at times when I seemed to be a bit lost trying to figure out who's the good or bad guy, then after an hour or more I just didn't care one way or the other. Again, great actors, great photography, and a cerebral plot - a combo which should have produced a memorable 2 hour film. At the very end I simply could care less who was the mole, or why, and I was just happy it finally ended. During the movie I said to myself, perhaps this is the type of movie that needs to be watched twice to fully appreciate the nuances. However, when I left the theatre I simply said to myself, that that was a few hours of my life I won't be getting back. Sad, because I am a huge movie fan but in the past 10 years I have had to carefully pick and choose from the fluff that hollywood turns out. I am a huge fan of TCM which shows all the classic movies from the 20's to the 60's and I do love a good cold war flick.  I have scoured reviews for this movie and found that most seemingly intelligent reviewers fell into either the, Loved It, or Waste of Time, category with few in between. For my rating I was trying to be fair and objective but sadly I can only give it 2 stars - I was going to give it 3 but I just can't, I didn't enjoy it, and didn't care about any of the characters one way or the other. Take this with a grain of salt, you may love it, or you may be bored to tears watching all this talent go to waste. However, I do have a desire to see the original version/series of [[ASIN:B005DXCO94 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy with Alec Guiness]] which is over twice as long, reported to have deep character development, and has stood the test of time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|While I adored both the first book and the third, this one takes the cake as my favorite. I love them.
1439153663|5.0|Could not put this book down!  Great book! Started reading it one night and had to wake up early the next day to finish it.  Powerful!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely adore this series.  I've read it 8 or 9 times through.  It warms my heart, and makes me truly think about society.  Definitely a quick read, and it'll be on your mind for a long time!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|great app, makes my fire a portable computer. I can literally do anything I could do on a desktop. then again, I am using a desktop, in a way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is super! My husband and I absolutely love it and share at night with the audio reading then discussion
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I ordered this as a Christmas gift. It arrived quickly and was packed well. I purchased it on sale and got a great price.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|The crowd was whipped into a FRENZY! I went to see this with my mom on Oct 7 this year and it was a birthday present for me!  >EASILY< the best birthday present I have ever had! I was so thrilled I went to Walmart after the show and bought the \\"Atom Bot\\" action figure! The IMAX theater went BONKERS! It's charming, witty, funny, emotional and action-packed! The fight scenes were absolutely JAW-DROPPING! I noticed my mouth was wide open watching this jewel!  Better news! A SEQUEL is due in 2013! I am SO gonna be there!
0613657578|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. It was exactly what she wanted. The book arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  As most everyone states, it has good graphics and entertaining game play. I would love to see more stories from the developer - perhaps with more items and puzzles, which will take longer to solve. Phone = Droid X
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game offers a high replay value and continuous fun trying to unlock all the games. one of my favorites.
B000UR9QIK|2.0|The 2 star rating is not for this classic film itself, which is arguably the greatest zombie movie ever made. It easily warrants 5 stars as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />This is just regarding this Blu-ray release. With the 4 disc Ultimate Edition(and believe me, it lives up to that title) available, this Blu-ray release is in many ways inferior right out of the gate due to it being just the theatrical cut of the film and some of the bonus features ported over from the Ultimate Edition with absolutely nothing new thrown in the mix. Naturally the movie does look better on Blu-ray in native 1080p, but frankly the DVD version looks damn good upconverted through a Blu-ray player anyway. Not to mention there's not much else you can do to improve the picture quality on 30+ year old low budget horror movie like this. It's hardly going to be a tech demo for high definition video like a newer 200 million dollar CGI action fest will be. Frankly, this is the problem with a lot of these Blu-ray releases of catalog films. Often they look so good on a DVD upcoverted through a Blu-ray player there's little incentive to upgrade to the Blu-ray release. The \\"Beyond High Definition\\" blurb on the case is laughable.<br /><br />More effort needs to be put forth here to warrant a purchase. See the Blu-ray release of Lucio Fulci's \\"Zombie\\" to see how it's done. They went back to the original camera negative and painstakingly digitally restored the movie to create a Blu-ray release that would truly blow your mind. Oh, and they produced a crap ton of new quality bonus material to boot. That's Blu-ray catalog film done right.<br /><br />In short, if you don't already own the Ultimate Edition, get that one instead of this half-assed Blu-ray release. The slight improvement in picture quality just isn't worth it when the massive 4-disc DVD version offers soooo much more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really fun and I love it. its awesome and everyone should get it. it works great on the kindell fire.
B005KELQEU|2.0|The product looks nice but with 2 zippers I expected to be able to open it in a 180° fashion. No, you can't completely open it, thus, in order to read your Kindle you have to remove it completely from the sleeve. Again, the sleeve itself looks nice but it is NOT what you expect for US$ 30. Quite dissapointed
0446585025|3.0|I love Ellen. I think she is hilarious, she stands for so many good things, and she is so visibly kind to others, a rare quality in the vast array of egocentric celebrities. Still, still, although I enjoyed the quiet humor in this book, it is too casual and light. It reads like she is talking, and it doesn't seem enough for a whole book. Often she makes jokes where a few words make up an entire chapter. In the end, I feel kind of gypped and the book feels kind of shallow. Ellen is anything but shallow, so I feel certain that isn't what she intended. I just think she needed to devote more time and effort to this effort.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This is Lady A at their best.  A must have for any Lady A fan or any fan of music of any genre.
0316056863|4.0|I hate to sound like a snob, but this isn't easily accessible humor. It is smart humor.   As much as I loved Tina's portrayal of Sarah Palin, I didn't realize she is such a strong feminist. Her book has lots of pointed humor, and even, at times, quite cynical humor. Still, as a feminist, I appreciated the points that she made. I was unaware of the vast amount of sexism in comedy show business. Without being pedantic, Tina shows us this very clearly.  While she reveals odd bits about her personal life, such as her appreciation of her father and her struggle with the decision whether to have children and whether it is okay not to stay home and raise them, she avoids sentimentalism about her own life. This, I didn't like so well. I would have enjoyed hearing more about her background in its entirety. Instead, the book read more like half-autobiographical and half a portrait of the comedy industry from a feminine point of view.  I'm going to have to agree that it is uneven. Still, Tina's unusual wit and her smart style shine through, and make it a worthwhile and unique read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot. you never get bored with the selections. everyone of all ages can find a favorite game.
B005COO1X6|4.0|'Mile 81' puts King firmly in the territory that his fans love the most - total, skin-crawling horror wrapped around the most ordinary things in life. Creepy cars and ugly happenings at rest stops aren't new territory for King, but he gives them a different twist this time around. It's a short, so the characters aren't as full-scale as you might be used to with King, but it works for this story. Meeting these characters is a lot like the meetings you have with people in the real world - a brief glimpse, a bit of their story, and then they're gone.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Did anybody else notice this cool feature?  It allows you to have a live wallpaper showing the current phase of the moon for your location.  Pretty neat.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Got this game today for my son to play but after looking through it I have deleted it. There are far too many ads, and many link to something to buy for a fee. Only played a couple of games and they were so-so, but I primarily deleted because of the ads.
B003F1WM2K|3.0|This book was just okay but I did enjoy hearing about the people and places in New York City in the 60's.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Too many ads. Whatever you do, do not update. The system is jank. It's alright, but now I'm just trying to fill space.
B000JMKRKC|2.0|Another overly wordy book.  There is nothing that motivates me to pick this up and read.  I am about one third of the way through it and keep hoping it will get better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because it is very very very addicting. it is also a very fun game to play.
B005QMOZOO|1.0|Very boring, poorly plotted novel which must surely have JA turning in her grave. No wit, deus ex machina everywhere, Elizabeth is little more than a prop, Fitzwilliam turns out to be a dry, almost cruel bore. Not up to  PD James' usual standards?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game I have played it for 6 years and I never get bored of it it is an awesome game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game and really cool graphics = 3 (no face intended)  stars, too hard - 1 star, I like it +2 stars
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works extremely well with my Kindle Fire. Protects it from just about everything you can think of ... and give you a better grip than just the Kindle alone. Well worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Game is fun and addictive. Will suck you in and become a major time drain.  Runs well on kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun getting points and unlocking new games I play it every day and the games are funny and fun lol
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is absolutely the best Solitaire ever.  Thanks for a quick, challenging and fun diversion. Go Amazon and Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this is a great game to play any where. it is the best game any one can play
B0054JZC6E|2.0|The games with easier controls are OK, but easy. A good chunk of the games have sticky controls on my droid x, making almost impossible to beat them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'll admit, I was skeptical about starting this trilogy because I'm not usually into Sci-Fi. BUT- as soon as I started, I could not put this book down! I read the entire book in about 2 days, reading whenever I had a spare moment. I cannot wait to start the second, but I'm trying to wait a little bit because I know once I finish them all I'll miss them. I would definitely recommend the Hunger Games. It's captivating, intense, and exciting all the way through. You can't help but fall in love with Katniss, the narrator. I already feel so emotionally attached to her, and I'm so anxious to see what the next two books have to offer. If you are debating reading the Hunger Games- Just Do it!! You will not regret it! You are transported to another world, and you get to live it through Katniss' eyes. You get to experience her adrenaline as she participates in this deadly adventure, all the time trying to foresee who the victor will be! Enjoy the Hunger Games, I know you will!!
1433502410|1.0|I just dont feel good when I read this. It attacks other religions while siting inaccurate resources. It tries to make you believe a certain message. While God's real message is something different. Much like a wolf in sheeps clothing. If you read the Bible I recommend the King James. The Language is harder, but I find the translations to be more accurate *note I do not say perfect. Don't just believe what your fed. God is who reveals truth, not scholars with an agenda. If you sincerely seek him he will find you. I know this because I felt him in my own life. That's what makes me nervous about these \\"interpretations\\" because they teach people to believe what a man came up with. I'll trust the Holy Ghost.
B002ZG981E|1.0|The audio/vide sync was terrible, especially with any dicaprio monologue.  I have a samsung bd-d5500, onkyo receiver, samsung 7000 series TV. The receiver is set to pass the streams straight through. So it is not an equipment problem.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|From notes to study plans, the is the best Bible I know on a digital platform.  One can set up your Bible personally for you!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|The movie played fine despite being an import.  However my Samsung BD-D5500 had some limitations (unless other people have had these issues)  1) Noticeable loss of sync between audio and video, sync varied throughout directors cut aliens. Not as Bad as Inception.  2) Had to plug in USB drive on dvd player because the disc menu (a program) requires alot of memory-- more memory than Samsaung saw fit to put inside the BD-D5500
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|its cute and ok. just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. but it was free so I have no complaints.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Have had the free Tunein Radio app forever and updated to the Pro. The recording option does not work. Pretty disappointed since that is why I went with the Pro.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its so fun! and passes time well!(: highly recommend! I enjoy it so much! so fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the best games in the whole wide woerld.  I will be entertained for a long time to come
0385535139|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and the variety of characters (Oscar and Wally and their \\"boutique firm\\" in particular).  It was suspenseful and fun and while not in the class of some of Grisham's best work (like The Firm) it was still a fun read and I found it difficult to put down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best app ever .keeps me entertained forever ......best app ever best app ever. keeps me entertained forever ......best app ever!!!!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Not optimized for ICS yet. Can't wait to play the game without it locking up so much. Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is by far the absolute best remote desktop application. I have ever used. It is an easy install on your tablet and a quick install and configuration on your desktop. Sign into gmail with the app on your PC and tab and it finds it on your tab in a matter of seconds. Very easy to use,simple tutorial. It supports dual monitors if you have them. Display resolution configuration allows you to see your desktop in its native environment. 5/5 stars, thumbs up. I will never use another Rep app again.
B0063IH60K|2.0|hate the movie ad interruptions.  they stop/exit the game, open the web browser, and load/play.  would keep if not for that.
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|The tribal council called a midnight council last night to discuss the most alarming threat to the pack:  MPP.  I too howled my objection, &quot;in the past we bite without discrimination. It's unfair that we now have to take a bigger chunk out of the iPhone, BB, WP carriers.&quot;  The council nodded in consent.  In the end the elders decided to move forward with plan B: the Chinese.  &quot;We shall encourage the Chinese to speed up their moon mining ambition.  When they blew up the moon or disturbed its orbit, this app shall no longer work.&quot;  &quot;In the mean time, to maintain fairness to all on our victims, please limit your biting of hipsters, suits and Bill Gate.&quot;
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very easy to use. I used othe apps of this kind and  this could be the easiest one to control and connect to your computer, you can even wake up the PC and access your USSR user account.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is the old favorite game, on my new kindle fire.  it works well, but is best with screen horizontal or cards too small
B000KE5JNE|4.0|This is truly a great period piece and very well done. Beautiful costuming, scenery, and acting. A great pleasure to watch.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|This is an album that for Amy fans will leave your gut wrenching from the knowledge there will be no more new material from this phenomenally gifted artist. There is very little new material on this album, which is comprised mainly of demos and alternate takes of previously released tracks. The upside is, that this is pure Amy, her unique voice unwavering and her personality shining through in every line. It will leave a trail of sadness however as her voice trails off on the last track, leaving us with the knowledge that her potential was never fully realized.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not bad for a free time killer.  Just started playing so hoping the games get better as I go along.
B00095NX9G|3.0|So let me first tell you my dance level which definitely affects whether you buy this DVD or not.  I would describe myself as an advanced beginner.  I took one year of formal classes then moved to a smaller town that didn't offer classes but had a troupe I could join and could pick up tips from more advanced dancers.  For example, yes I know what a maya is but nope still can't control my belly undulation very well.  So if you find yourself at my level as an advanced beginner I would say just wait until you get a bit further along in your dance before you buy this DVD.  It's just a little bit beyond my level if I am perfectly honest with myself.  On the otherhand maybe if I practice it more (without getting frustrated) I will get better....hard to say as I've just had the DVD for two weeks.    Also on another note I do practice yoga and did not love her yoga instruction.  I think she is an AWESOME belly dancer and should stick to that instead of aspiring to be a yogini.  If you want a yoga dvd sara ivanhoe makes a great beginner one or if you are more advance Shiva Rea is amazing.  So there you go - that's my two cents = )
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I have the NASA website bookmarked to monitor the phases of the moon.  I can't believe a company would make an app like this. It's beautiful and made so well, I love it. I would like to see astrology data included.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|challenge &amp; variety. the games are simple, but not super easy and if u get bored there are plenty of other options th choose from.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|As everybody knows by now, SUPER 8 was kind of a homage to Spielberg film by Abrams,<br /><br />At the beginning, I was liking it much more than I expected and was really enjoying the 70's era vintage vibe and the story of young kids ................. BUT ............... as the movie went along it became clear it was TOO CLOSE to being a thinly disguised remake of E.T.<br /><br />This became less of a homage and more of a \\"by the numbers\\" plot re-work bordering on a flagrant remake with a slightly darker tone.<br /><br />Up until the 50 minute mark, I felt SUPER 8 was going to be a 4.5- 5.0 star movie, but from about 55 minutes onwards it started to fall apart and fade and lost its charm and became basically gave up trying to even disguise the fact it was remaking E.T.<br /><br />As with most critics of the film, the last 10 minutes (ENDING) was very weak and falls flat compared to the rest of the the film.<br /><br />The kid actors (and other actors) did a great job.<br />The set and wardrobe people did a great job.<br /><br />As mentioned above ...... for the first 2/3 of the movie, it was on track to be almost a 5 star rating ............. but then it became TOO FORMULAIC and predictable and seemed TOO CLOSE to E.T. and many other similar movies.<br /><br />Also the last 1/3 of the movie is where the plot holes became very obvious and the logic of the plot falls apart with inconsistencies.<br /><br />Entertaining to watch and much respect for those who worked on the film, but not one we will add to our DVD collection or ever watch again in the future.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|only downloaded this game today and it seems pretty cool and somewhat challenging... you have to beat games and gain points in order to unlock other games.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This is probably the best acted and best picture that both actors Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe have ever made.  When the public thinks of them, they mostly think of good looking, alright watchable actors.  In this film I was pleasantly surprised to find that they actually do more than act as pretty boys on a screen, they get into their roles with high calibre intensity.  They don't just act, they disappear into these characters.  I was reminded that they are in fact talented when given the right material to work with and push themselves into.  It certainly doesn't hurt to throw them in the shot with some fantastic supporting players like Marisa Tomei who is always a brilliant performer and William Macy who does an amazing job as a washed up hard working private investigator.  The movie is a crime thriller and a good one with many angles.<br /><br />Matthew plays a lawyer who more or less works in the backseat of his Lincoln car.  He's got a driver now since he's got a DUI pinned to the vehicle.  Yeah his character has a bit of a drinking problem, but he still manages to get criminals off the legal way.  His world is turned upside down when he's hired by Ryan Phillippe's character to defend him from being accused of murder.  Phillippe stomps his feet that he's innocent, but its not long before Matthew starts to suspect something fishy.  The unraveling to the final finish pulls out some great performances and entertaining storytelling.  Makes for a  fine Saturday night.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is the best game ever except for the fact it takes a long time to get enough points to unlock new games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this a good app,never boring! my son loves having little competitions with me. i think this app is definitely worth trying. highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its my fav. app so cool but some of the games are boring so yeah. that's my review. this is awsome
B0058VW36U|4.0|Good fun puzzle game. Preaty easy till the last few boxes. Some levels rely on luck. Expect lots of do-overs.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Fast delivery, product came to just the way i ordered it. no complaints here.Dexter is a awesome show! Looking forward to when season 6 comes out.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|decent game but a lack of navigational ability and high point cost of upper level games make its replay value a lot less.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the app on my kindle. I can use wherever I go where there is WiFi. I am please with the plan you can put yourself on to read daily.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this cover!!! It fits great, holds up to dropping, and it looks nice!!! I love it. I was so nervous to get it because I read mixed reviews about it. But I am happy with my purchase! I will recommend this product to my other Kindle friends!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Downloaded for my kids to have on my kindle fire, and they really seem to have a good time playing.  so far we have had no problems with this app.
0393035158|4.0|Clearly written, eye opening observations concerning the ramifications/dangers of religious dogmatism in a modern world. I think it would be great if everyone would at least familiarize themselves with the ideas expressed in this book whether they embrace them or not.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love curling up with this relaxing and challenging experience. if you need a way to -reorganize your thoughts this is agreat tool for this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was one of the best games I found on my kindle fire its fun and it plays great. I'm glad I got it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is a lot of fun but you have to replay the games to get enough points for new games. kind of annoying
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I had no problem installing the program, and the directions for each game were clear.  I haven't. cleared a couple, but I think it is my own lack of talent, not the games fault.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Finally an app that will show me the phase of the moon right on my phone's home screen.  It not only eliminates the need to look up, but you don't even have to get off the couch and look out a window.  And no rumageing around your phone for Moon Phase either, when you need to know the phase of the moon just press the on button and its there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought it would be cheap and stupid, but I loaded it any way. I'm so glad I did though because I was completely wrong about it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is perfect with so many fun and addicting mini games that you will get hours of fun challenges.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing! it has all my favorite games rout on one app! the other reviews r not true because its easy to get the new locked games!
B0059XTUMC|5.0|I was amazed at the quality of the silent acting in this film.  Acting of this calibre has rarely been seen since Chaplin, including the animal actor!  The story is touching, hunorous and beautiful by turns.  For once, the french will teach Hollywood.  A beautiful story and masterful acting can still move hearts.  I can't wait to buy the DVD and show this film to friends.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really liked this book.  I read it in 10 hours.  It was very hard to put down and at some points I had tears in my eyes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It tells about how real relationships can be--hard work and rewarding.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think the sentitivity could be improved.  And I think the required points to move to the next level could be lower.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|addicting, fun, I don't know where to start.  the only reason this app got 4 stars was because the games are too hard to unlock and there is no point in playing besides to unlock more levels.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Clear, easy to see, addicting. I'm not a huge tech person, but this is one of my favorites. Starts out easy, but I like that I can make it more challenging at my own pace.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great! Kindle fire use is easy and smooth. No lag or interruptions as of yet. Have no complaints.does exactly as it says. Simple set up.
0345373243|5.0|I absolutely loved how fast this book came, and also that it was in terrific condition like they said it was. It didn't come with the cover, which i can't remember if it said it had it or not, but it doesn't matter, only the book matters. it was in excellent condition and a good price and it came before Christmas!! it was fantastic!
0439023491|5.0|The first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy was splendid and stunningly amazing. Catching Fire is all that and fantastically gripping. In Catching Fire Katnisse and Peeta, although they survived the 74th Hunger Games, find themselves in even worse danger. Since the incident with the berries that kept Katnisse and Peeta alive, the Capitol is threatening Katnisse while rebellion stirs. This book grabbed me by the throat and did not let go!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app and think anyone in their right mind would get it and its free.I recommend this app to anyone who likes games.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|There are really no words for this CD as everyone should know that this is an awesome new and upcoming country artist.  I sure am glad The Band Perry is now completely involved within the country music business!  Love the CD and of course, \\"If I Die Young\\" will always be my favorite from this artist.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing I love it. people need to make more games like it !!!thank you for making it
B0067R0APK|2.0|AccuWeather uses the airport weather station across the Columbia River from where I live. Even though it's only about three miles away a river that size that is connected to the ocean has a great difference between the North and South side of the river, rain, whether it's actually freezing or not and many other things can be completely different. There are half a dozen other reporting stations on this side of the river, some only blocks from my house. Why is AccuWeather using weather stations in another state on the other side of a vast river. Maybe they should change the name to RandomWeather based on the really poor reporting. It's useless for any of the cool things this app could do if it had accurate reporting from actual local sources like WeatherBug has. I am sorry I got the Platinum version before I realized my mistake.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game to pass the time but the games are hard as fruit cake. . . .! ! ! ! ! ! !  !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love games to pass time. this is a great one, adds can be annoying.. but it is free! def download
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great great great game. Just played it last night and it is just what I was looking for. I call it a Risk style game as in it can take as long as Risk to play depending on strategy and the people playing it, but also wont take you 8 hours to play, unless you play with a beyond superior strategy group that can block each other and keep each other down. The basic game setup for beginners is perfect to learn the game and to learn all the aspects in the game. It took 3 player 3 hours to play it, we immediately set up a different variant all of 15 mins to setup, and another 45 mins to play. The rule book seems a little odd how they put it together, but once played it becomes second nature and boom your off to the races. Definately going to expand into the 5-6 player expansion and the added variant expansions with their coresponding 5-6 expansions. Well worth it depending on the number people you gather to play.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I started listening to her a couple of years back, before anyone had really heard about her, just like the guy from \\"Secondhand Serenade\\"!!  I guess I know good stuff when I hear it!!PEOPLE! Go out and buy these CD's or download them.  I strongly recommend it.
0671027344|5.0|This book moved me emotionally and psychologically the way that high quality fiction should move people. It is raw, honest, subtle, funny, touching and amazingly written. It speaks truth of the human milieu without being overdone or self-indulgent. It had been a very long time since I have read a novel that moved me to tears. This book did. I loved it.   I rarely read novels more than once. I think I will put this on my re-read list. I really wish Chbosky would write another.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good and interactive game like all of the challenges I will not be needing another game app for a while!
0061148512|5.0|It is an odd adverb to choose when talking about mental illness: beautifully. But one of the things that makes a fiction piece beautiful is its showing ugliness while still touching the heart. It makes you say yes, this is true. It brings both ache and a sigh. That is beauty.  This is an excellent book that captures the downward spiral of mental illness at a genius level. It is so odd that Plath initially published this book under another name because she was not proud of it. But I guess that is understandable since she suffered from mental illness herself.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I would not mind mediocrity or the flood of ads.  but to have both together is not worth the effort.
1441761268|3.0|Does Blackstone now record in basements?  Although times are tough, I still listen to books on CD, despite they are more expensive.  This cost $19 on CD, for that price I expect a quality production.  Don't buy this on Audio if you listen on personal CD or quality car player, please save you money and buy the paperback.  You can hear clicks every 3 or 4 words, the recording being turned on and off, so distracting you can't get the story.  Really, sounds like a home recording, a BAD home recording.    Thankfully, the clicks and clacks didn't show on my computer, so guess I'll be sitting in my office listening instead of on my personal player as I'd prefer.  The story so far seems good, the reader very accomplished, and I will still buy audiobooks on CD and downloads.  I'll think twice if the company is Blacktone, though, as quality seems not high on their New Years Resolution list for 2012.
B0063GORYU|2.0|video ads ruin it, as others have said. get rid of the trailers for stupid movies and ill give it 5 stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great way to get through Tv commercials and waiting in a doctors office. will get it on my new smartphone
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I don't care much for controlling my own computer with this, but it is an amazing tool to prank roommates.
B0063TX06I|5.0|A wonderfull album of the Bee Gees.The next step to the start of disco aera.Number one hits  ,like Nights on Broadway and jive talkin.The first step of Barry Gibb in valsetto singing.  A must have CD for every Bee Gees Fan.The best music group for all times.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|it is a very useful app, and since it is free I highly recommend it, especially if you are a space geek like me.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I loved this book from the first page that contained a funny numbered list. I loved Emma at all times. She was a fun character and had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion. I liked that I was predicting potential conflicts with the main characters and was wrong. This was a great read! I now need more from Sohpie Kinsella.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game!!! I bought the original Quell and after completing it, I couldn't wait to try Reflect. Very addicting and well worth the money.  There's no time limit but the puzzles are very challenging and will keep you coming back for more. Hats off to the dev for this one!!!!
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|I tried looking at the moon phase today, and it exploded. The moon exploded on my screen, causing the phone to vibrate uncontrollably. My screen cracked and my phone burst into flames. Thanks Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my opinion of this game is that it is woo addicting and I think that everyone could love this game
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I bought this album at Half Price Books for a dollar not really expecting much from Whitney because I had read some pretty average reviews about this album a few years ago and I hadn't been impressed with them. Boy was I surprised when I put this album on. It's current and it's got a great beat from start to finish with no high or low point. I can put the whole album on and clean the house from top to bottom. The ballads are fresh and the dance songs are club worthy. Sure her voice isn't what it used to be but she can still sing her heart out. I would recommend this album to all Whitney Houston fans alike and I'm glad I added this to my collection.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|It shipped quickly and made a great Christmas present!I was happy to buy a great product at a great price.  Thank you.   -Chris
0545403359|5.0|This is an excellent book.  I would give it my highest recommendation.  The story is very good; the writing is clear and concise; and the book is not so long that it cannot be read very quickly.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This product works as intended. Straight forward and simple. Definitely recommended for anyone needing to hook up a newer TV with only optical out to a device with analog / RCA in. Be sure your TV has variable audio  out if you plan to connect it directly to an amplifier.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is a must see movie for the holidays. We watch it several times during that season. When cable only ran it on ABC Family, heavily edited, I went right to Amazon and ordered it. Arrived very timely and in great condition. Saved the holiday tradition for us.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I looked at more than a few cases for our new Kindle Fire and read countless reviews.  Then I looked at Marware's video.  IMO, this case has three things going for it.  -It's well made.  -It's lightweight.  -It's fairly inexpensive.  The stand function works very well and yes, a flat surface is best but my wife has been able to use it while on the bed.  The Fire hasn't been dropped yet so I can't speak to that type of protection but I can tell you that the edges of the Fire are  extremely well protected by the case.  I like the fact that the strap built into the case can keep the cover open or closed.  Oh and the other thing I wanted in a case was complete access to the screen and all screen functions. Check.  This case delivers and am very pleased with my purchase.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I watched this one on PBS and can't wait for the DVD and the CD to be released. I have every concert on DVD that Celtic Woman has done and I have loved each and every one of them. I wish the reviewer that stated that the last DVD was an insult to the fans...well I just have to say that the reviewer doesn't speak for everyone! I didn't consider it to be an insult at all! Nothing Celtic Woman had done to date has disappointed me in either their performances or the quality of the DVD's.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app... hours of fun! I like having to beat games to move on to others... makes it more challenging
B003Y3AZSW|5.0|Really love using these cutting boards.  Compact and neat on my kitchen counter.  Easy to clean ... just put them in the dishwasher.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games inside the game are decently fun. a great way to pass the time if you are extremely bored.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really fun game with lots on lots and lots of other games with it. I would reccomend this game
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started this book 2 days after reading the first in the trilogy, and couldnt put it down. I finished it in less than a day and had started on the third. This book continues the way the first finished, with feelings that Katniss doesn't understand. Just as with the first book, you will feel as though you are in the story going through everything that the characters are. You will feel the stress, pain, happiness, and worry that Katniss feels in the book, as well as how her feelings for Peta are growing. This book covers the beginning of the war in Panem against the capitol, and while having more violence than the first book, it has just as much depth and understanding as well. Great read!
B00632HWOG|2.0|Slow. You're better off using the native email app for android. that was my experience. What more can I say? :D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read all three of these books in 4 days after seeing the movie trailer... if that doesnt tell you how great they are, I dont know what will. This book is amazing. Normally not a fan of \\"post apocolypse\\" genre books, this book brought a whole new light to how the world might be in the future. The storyline grips you and the author has a way of making you feel everything that everyone in the book is feeling at that time. The shere genius of making you feel like your starving, hunting, thirsting to death, beginning to feel love for someone, and making you feel what Katniss feels when shes fighting for her life is amazing. You will laugh, cry, and sit on your seat in anger at the capitol throughout this entire book. You will feel like you have been thrown right in the middle of the arena along with Katniss and the other contestants, and then be starving for the next book by the end. Amazing read!!!
B005UBNL0A|3.0|I got a new motherboard and replaced my  q2300 Intel 2.5ghz quad core with this and it gave me the same windows experience index after redoing the test. Benchmarks also tend to put it behind phenom 2 cards. Its not bad but don't be fooled by 3.6ghz as this is not a true quad core. Look it up for yourself. Not bad deal but don't expect a huge leap in performance. I now have the [[ASIN:B0056D5AMY AMD Phenom II X4 960T Processor, Black Edition, 3.0 4 Socket AM3 - HD96ZTWFGRBOX]] and they are equivalent in the windows experience index at stock clocks. Know what you are getting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very good verity! I liked it a lot! It was fun being able to play so many games in one app!But be careful because it's addictive!
B004EPYZT4|2.0|Okay, c'mon now....  It's CONAN THE BARBARIAN!!!!!  My husband and I hardly expected Academy Award winning material when we rented this.  We were only looking for entertainment and that's what we obtained.  For those of you who don't know the story, it is about a young barbarian (a.k.a. Conan) who wants to avenge the death of his father and entire village at the hands of an evil warlord and his sorceress daughter.  Jason Momoa (from Baywatch) intensely scowls his way through the entire movie in the title role.  The only reason I did not give this one star is that I LMAO through most of this movie and I have seen far worse movies than this one.  It also brought back fond memories of the even more absurd original with Arnold S.  It is worth watching if you have seen the original movie or are entertained by movies with absurd plots.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|To address the one oft mentioned issue. The developer is now aware that it shows waning gibbous for today (1/8/12) and it only seems to affect today. He is working on a fix for it. If you're guess that means you get a quick reply from the Dev, you'd be absolutely correct.   The app works beautifully on my Droid 2 Global and I had no issues with it freezing. However, I did use the back button to exit out and not the home button. Overall, between quick developer response and the very slick, nicely done app, can't help but give this little darling a 5 star. If you like having the phases of the moon at your fingertips, this is the app for you and with it being FAOTD? You can't lose. ;)
886293713X|5.0|Let me be clear: I'm a Moleskine fan-boy. While I know the current Moleskine company has nothing to do with the original company and that the nostalgia they market is pure bunk...the notebooks are still top-notch to me. Which some find odd, since I'm somewhat of a gadget and tech geek, too. I love my smartphone which is perfectly synced with my Google calendar as well as my wife's calendar. But on a daily basis, I just prefer to have a paper calendar with a notebook - I find it easier to think out loud.<br /><br />This planner fits perfectly with what I've come to expect from Moleskine. Each week is given one page of the pocket-sized paper with a lined notebook sheet opposite it. If you have a schedule packed with appointments, you may find little room to capture them all. But if you, like me, typically have few appointments that cover large chunks of your day, you'll be fine (just write small and legibly!).<br /><br />The paper is thin and silky, able to retain both ballpoint ink and pencil equally nicely, and stands up to repeated erasures. The red cover is a welcome break from the typical black that I usually get from Moleskine - and it makes it easy to find! The typical back pocket is present, but with a nice added touch: the back flap of a small notebook is tucked into it, creating a handy extra writing area.<br /><br />There are tons of extras, most which are nice, but I won't use. There are sheets of stickers (most of which I'm not sure what they're intended to indicate), reference guides, and even a ruler.<br /><br />I truly hope they continue making this for 2013 and beyond as this will certainly be my new calendar!
B000001ESP|4.0|Rush / Moving Pictures: I admit that I am not a fan of Rush.  However, this is the one album (at least) from Rush that deserves to be heard and owned, even by a person like me.  There is certainly more here than just \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and the whole album shows how good a band Rush can be.  They are not my style, but this album could not be ignored.  I like it, I don't love it, so I give it Four Stars.
0143035711|5.0|I read Mason's book many years ago and re-read it whenever my writing skills are in-question.  There are too many recommendations of Chickenhawk regarding its accuracy or historical  importance - as a non-expert on the Vietnam, I have no idea how to critique this aspect of the book.  But, I believe Mason - reading the book, the action of Bob's military service is detailed.  He writes that a few names were changed out of respect to his colleagues and their families - that's probably just as well because not everyone in the Vietnam War conducted themselves well.  The pacing is even, the action is definitely \\"there\\" - you'll read of combat, of relationships within the unit and interesting insight into the culture of Vietnam.  But the pleasure of reading Chickenhawk is not so much its retelling of history but of the way the guy writes.  Robert is truly a gifted writer - the kind that can tell a story, keep you on your edge without necessarily leading you to conclusions; situations and circumstances are described that fairly involve the reader as someone experiencing the moment alongside the writer.  Again, there are a load of recommendations for Chickenhawk; there are three things you should know when considering buying this book.  1. It's a historical narrative of a man's experiences as a combat helicopter pilot in Vietnam.  2. The writer's story is interesting no matter if you're interested in Vietnam, war or whatever.  3.  Robert Mason is an excellent writer and would have done as well if he wrote on the evolution of knitting needles.  Chickenhawk is a good book, period - and in so being, really transcends the need for a detailed review.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing solitaire and this one is fun. I actually win sometimes not always, that would not be fun.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|its a fun  game but it shuts down in the middle of it at times. I cannot figure out what triggers it to close.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Having found myself finished with the series only moments ago, I still find I'm in a stupor, or would it be shock. Before writing my review I took a moment to read two one star ratings, wonder what they found lacking in this book, since I am still trying to figure if I do. The items found were that the ending is unsatisfactory because as I've deduced they didn't get the happily ever after that is evident in most books, but must be remembered for exactly what it is: Fictional; another item to be found would be that Katniss's character regressed as the book continued. I suppose if you're looking for the traditional compilation of words to form fiction and the happy ending in a book then this would be a disappointment. This book is fictional. It's emotional, spiritual, mental, and moral presentation is not.  I did not write reviews for the first two books because for me, as amazing as they were they fall into the standard of the most books I've read: entertaining, new perspective, great characters and conflicts. This final book, however, I could not let pass without a review. This is my third thus far and I have lost count over how many books I've read and rated personally somewhere around 75 I believe (without a review even though many I gave 6/5 stars). They all tend to blend and overlap.  First addressed grievance: character regression. Katniss does regress in character. As much as this may shock people who read books, you forget that not all humans are noble and giving. In fact I doubt any would be able to refute the claim that we all constantly think in terms of self preservation though we strive and often fail for nobler things (maybe not constantly, for that is unforgiving, but reliably on occasion). Her regression is necessary. I would consider this book as entertainment but none the less a fail and a book that is only so-so, no loss at not having read it, if Katniss did not experience this regression. This book presents the moral, emotional, and mental issuesthat make it real and perhaps unpleasant to swallow. It presents the question of how far can the human soul stretch, in morality and in justification for unjustifiable action, before it shatters (not break, shatter. A break in a ceramic vase can be easily glued and the hairline crack hidden, but shattered, no matter how reassembled or pulled back together will forever look fragile and be on the edge of breaking, similar to a soul). It calls to mind Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  Second addressed grievance: No happy ending. Tell me truly, with all that the characters are put through in this book, is there really a possibility for a happy ending? The author could have rewritten it so, I have no doubt and be among the other few thousand others who I would never write a review for because they DIDN'T write a book worth that.  I suppose for some this book has been made too real, for after all isn't a book meant to be fictional? Every book, somewhere has some truth engrained in it because authors are humans and humans will pull from what they know as true. Truth: war changes people. You don't go through hell and back without is touching your soul. For me the ending while, perhaps not satisfactory is just - or should I say the only true outcome that is available to our characters. It is right. Unhappily so, because it touches perhaps to close to reality when it's supposed to be fiction.  I rated the book a five star. Do I like this book? No, because for me it lies a little to close to the truth. Will I read it again? I think never. So why give it a five? Because it's good enough to read once and leave that big of an impression. Would I recommend it? Mmmmhhh... I think that's the same as your buddy asking if he/she should or shouldn't join the marines. How can you say yes when you know it will change him or her forever, perhaps even kill him or her? How can you say no, when you're not willing to do it yourself, knowing full well someone has to defend your country, beliefs, way oflife? Ultimately I would say no, for both. Because once you do either there is no going back.
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|Nice but not accurate, it do not apply the Daylight Saving Time changes when look for a future dates. Please fix it. With out fix is not reliable. Otherwise, nice features.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Although this game doesn't have the graphics some others do, it does have variety. Good way to kill time and there is something for everyone...
B004LWZW4W|4.0|This was a great movie and a good value for a 2 disc edition. It held my interest, and found it a great start for Plant of the Apes movies, however I'm not sure anyone was doing the type of research they were when this was suppose to take place.  Really fast delivery, packaged so that no damage happens.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I got addicted to the Harry Potter movies pretty early and have bought copies of them all - the first three on DVD the rest on Blu-ray.  The movies are very fun to watch and this is no different.<br /><br />If you've paid close attention to the earlier movies there are no surprises and yet there was still a feeling of suspense throughout.  The details, the actual scenes, the interaction of the characters, etc. all make for a great movie.  Things, of course, come to their neat conclusions as expected giving a satisfying close to the series.<br /><br />If you've watched the other movies this is highly recommended (of course, if you watched part 1, this is a must).<br /><br />A slight editorial (and I know I am going to get slammed for writing it)- giving 1 or 2 stars because you don't like the digital distribution (the one that every movie I bought in the last year is using and I've had 0 problems with)?  This makes no sense what so ever to me.  I think I'll give a restaurant a terrible review because even though the food was cooked to perfection , the service was impeccable and the bottle of Château Margaux was beyond belief, I didn't care for the sprig of parsley on one plate....
0375826742|1.0|I read Eragon and Eldest and they were pretty good.  I bought Brisingr when it first came out, but never got around to reading it.  Now that Inheritance is out, I figured I better read it.  This book is over 700 pgs. of boring, over descriptive, crap.  I wish there was a Cliff Notes version of this book.  Nothing really happens that is crucial to the story.  I had heard that this was to be a trilogy, but the author had too much content to put in the third book, so he made a fourth.  He easily could have left 95% of this book out and only made a trilogy.    I wish I didn't already buy Inheritance, because then I wouldn't have had to finish Brinsingr.  This book is painful to read and I skipped over as much as I could just to get to the end.  I hope the last book justifies the time I spent reading this one.
0553284347|5.0|I just finished this book last night.  I also just sent my letter of confrontation -- last night.  I don't know how my story will end, but it probably will end with permanent estrangement. We've already been largely estranged for more than a year, when I broke out of my assigned \\"role\\" after my mother's death. I didn't realize that's what I'd done until I'd read the book.  I think what was so painful about this book was seeing myself and my family on virtually every single page. I almost skipped the section for alcoholics, since no one in my family drank, but I didn't, and I'm so thankful I didn't. You see, my mother was mentally ill and largely untreated. The secrecy and shame that surrounded her illness colored every aspect of our lives. It was as if she was the alcoholic. I still grieve for all we lost due to a stupid stigma that she didn't deserve, that none of us deserved.  If you have a dysfunctional family and suffered from wounds or trauma in your childhood, this book will start you on the painful path of healing. You will cry. You will open up pus-filled, infected wounds that you thought were long since scarred over. You will discover pain that you thought had long since quieted to a dull ache reawakened to a burning fire.  But you will also find a small flicker of burning hope. Reach for it. There's healing there.
078884461X|4.0|Spirited Away, while not my favorite of Miyazaki's films, is amazing. The story line is great, and the animation is absolutely beautiful.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|He rates every single app he dislikes with crazy, farout reviews. look at the little piano pro reviews- he claims he is deaf in that one. Seriously, he is a liar!
B006INDMEE|2.0|The story line was good, the acting was superb by all, but for someone who also wants a decent ending to book end the interest I had in the beginning...I was so disappointed. When it ended I said out loud, \\"Are you kidding me? What a stupid ending!\\"  The movie started out as a 10 then slid all the way to zero.
B002U6CJCE|4.0|Visceral and intense!  This is a smart approach to action with realistic fighting sequences by militarized zombies.  Van Damme is brilliant and the story arc is totally awesome.  A real surprise to this curbed franchise.  A must buy for any action fan.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Every adult should watch this movie...I thought because Matt Damon was involved it would be slanted to the left and biased but he did a completely fair job exposing all the vermin who are making America's important decisions. Watch this and then do something to elect people that will HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WHO LIE CHEAT AND STEAL. I have burned copies of this and gave them out....the more who know, the more watchdogs we'll have.
0307949435|5.0|I am in means a scientist or doctor, but could follow this book pretty well.  I like the facts presented, don't just tell me what to do tell me why it works (done).  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is perfect for those times when you only have a few mins to waste. It's great for young minds.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've used simulator apps. This one works great over 3/4g and works great with sound. Highly recommended. (Does Amazon not want us to write review? What's with this minimum word limit?)
B000UX6THK|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this, even after watching Fire Walk With Me, and to be honest the first episode bugged me out a little which is actually something that never happens to me. But past that, this show is filled with righteousness that'll keep you watching again and again for all of time. I love this show it's so funny!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|addictingly fun games that keep you playing for hours without realizing. many different games for everyone. easy enough for younger kids
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I think it's great how they made 117 games in 1 app but you should get them all at once. Some games were too hard and some were too easy. And what's up with you Gavin to buy points?  But if it was me this app would he designed. different
B003GFIWGK|5.0|It actually depresses me that I waited till after I seen BOTH! movies to read these stories. So unbelievable so enticing, at night I read until way past my average bed time, and keep telling myself one more chapter until I finish that story. I just felt that I had to post something because I know this probably deserves 10 stars. I hope this helped someone make up their mind and buy this! especially for only $9!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I originally did not buy this product because of the original price.  Once the price dropped I picked it up.  Very pleased with it.  The only concern I see happening is the cover and elastic band getting worn to quickly.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This video was purchased as a Christmas present for my 16 year old son.  We watched it this afternoon and it was better than we expected.  Having grown up w/ the old Planet of the Apes, my husband and I weren't looking forward to watching this movies.  However, we were both pleasantly surprised.  The acting was good and the apes looked so life like it was amazing.  It had a very good story line and we are hopeing that they make another one that picks up where this ones leaves off.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this is a wonderful game.I just wish the games cost so much. Download this app if you like fun then download thisngame.
B0063IH60K|1.0|the game is a good version of solitaire.  the is an ad before you start each game which is fine for a free app.  what makes this crap is that DURING a game it has been opening my browser and pulling up ads.
B001HYY35G|1.0|I'll never understand how these guys blew up so much just from a few measly songs & one half-ass album and I'll never understand why people cant see through the hype & image. Apparently as long as you look, dress, & act like a \\"rockstar\\" people are stupid enough to fall for it & will believe that you actually are one. I think I'm going to go out and buy a leather jacket & tight black pants.   Justice is mostly HYPE/IMAGE and not much musical talent. I'm not saying they have no talent at all, they obviously have some because they have produced a few really good tracks. But they dont have nearly as much as people seem to think they do. It's unfortunate that the masses of asses in this world cant see through all that & keep the wool pulled over their eyes, but oh well. That's their problem not mine.   These 2 guys should be thanking their lucky stars that they got to meet Pedro (Busy P), because if it wasnt for that man then Justice would still be nobodies & people would probably be saying \\"yeah, they're alright I guess.\\" But put a bunch of HYPE & MARKETING & BLOG LOVE behind it and suddenly everyone says \\"OMG they are the greatest thing ever, they look so cool!\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the BEST app ever!  I love it and it's so User friendly.  I'm in my 70s and recommend this highly.  How great this would have been way back when.  Thank you!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've tried a few apps to connect to home and this one is made for us technically aware but inexperienced with networking users. i was up and running with no problems whatsoever.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this is an excellent app. convenient and efficient. I had a sync issue once and lost a saved file somehow, but aside from that, it's great.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|**No Spoilers**  This was just an excellent movie.  The main character was so wonderful..  Her portrayal of someone who just gets out of prison, just by the looks on her face, was pretty amazing.  You could tell what she was thinking.  She was so amazing.  This is the story of a young woman who is involved in a tragic accident.  It happens to occur on the night the world discovered there was a duplicate Earth out there.  There is very little about the duplicate Earth part of the story, but what there was was ingenious.  Has a cool ending also!  Do see it.  I have a list of about 20 films that are my all time favorites, and this is one of them.  The movie may not get an Oscar, but the young actress might.  In fact, if you loved Melancholia, you will love this one too, though Melancholia is on a ranking all by itself.  If you see this one and like it.....do see Melancholia as it is my number one all time favorite movie now!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is awesome and I love it so much I play it till I get bored. its so addicting yipp
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game. Works great on my kindle fire. If you like mini games you should give this a try.
B004Y1USV2|1.0|I suppose we have to that Squire and his gang of Buggle Thugs for putting out this dross.  They have served at least two valuable purposes.  First, they have saved generations of music students to come from having to wonder who was the real genius behind the great work of Yes.  Sure, there was the dreadful Drama on the one hand and the scintillating work of Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe on the other.  This indicated that Yes without Anderson is awful and Yes without Squire does just fine, thank you.  But an exception does not make a rule.  Now the proof is in.  No need ever wonder who made Yes great.  And it sure wasn't Squire, not even with the help of Howe.  Listening to this album is like eating a meal made with fine ingredients and having no chef.  There is no direction.  Solos of great virtuosity wander around in circles and dwindle into nothing.  Interesting lyrical ideas spin into cliché'.  Nothing goes anywhere valid.  The second value this work has is that it finally freed Anderson from the flatulent corpse of Yes.  Now able to delve into the wonders of what Anderson rightly called the species changing event of the internet, he has already created two great works:  The Living Tree and Survival and Other Stories.    Good job Chris.  You freed Anderson and condemned yourself to immortal infamy in one blow.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The most popular remote desktop app cost $30, as far as I can tell this is the same thing for a fraction of the price.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is easy to use. It gives me the opportunity to save multiple cities (which the website doesn't as easily) and keeps me up-to-date with the weather.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love this app great little games to pass the time. This app is great for me when I babysit my cousins kids, keeps them off my laptop.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|- gives all the details an astronomy fan would want.  I don't know how much the average person will use it though.
B006SV2LWA|1.0|Slow ! No real plot! Just an all around bad movie! dont waste your money or your time!! Iam sory I did
030726999X|2.0|The story is fairly good but at the book's half when you're hooked to the story it starts to be long-winded and then you'll know the story's end. I really don't understand why a writer has to contend who'll write more pages. This book could it be fast paced if it would be written with 200 pages less. I can't say is a good work but at least I read it.
B003VS0CX8|3.0|this video arrived in a broken case and has been very difficult store away...poor design quality.  Too much crammed into bubble-wrapped envelope.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great fun for everyone. kids and adults will enjoy working to unlock all the levels it's shot sweet and fun to play
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this app has many games and the fact that its free makes it a little better however there are a ton of adds
B006MHWXMS|4.0|It manages multiple lists. It integrates very nicely with Google tasks. It doesn't run a daemon to sync as of the latest update, which is great. Four stars only because it doesn't work with the \\"nested\\" task structure of Google. I bought it when it was free, so, I might be biased.
030788743X|5.0|I decided to read this book because of its top ranking.  So my expectations were set rather high when I started reading it.  And I was not disappointed at all, the book lived up to the 5 star rating: I could not put it down, read it from cover to cover almost in one sit.  Very highly recommended to everyone with an interest in sci-fi and fantasy books, especially those who had the luck to be a teenager in the 80's!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Quick and easy. Great graphics! Recommend this to all who love Solitaire. Love being able to put it down and come back to same game any time.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|First: good app. 2nd: FAOTD reviews is now like Twitter and Facebook---everyone thinks they are a comedian. And none of you are.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is in the top in the three of my favoite games. It is a good game. I like it
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Excellent movie & book. As a white, raised in the south, the story line really tells it as it was. Excellent!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie is better than I had expected.  It appeals to truth, history, human bravery and endurance, faith in God and humor of human nature. This is a sure academy winner/top pick movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Once you figure out the objective, its a lot of fun. It's addicting. The instructions are obtained by clicking on each game's question mark. Unlocking the game is challenging. For some reason I can't. activate. the subunit button.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The Kindle Fire was an early Chistmas gift for me this year. YEAH. I LOVE it. I searched thru the Christmas hoildays while I was out for a protective cover. I found that the stores didn't have exactly what I was looking for and the majority of the products seemed like they were more multipurpose rather than a made for Kindle Fire I was looking for. If I was going to protect it I wanted something that was made to fit. This item by Amazon is the best: it was made for the Fire, securely fits the Fire and acts as if it was always there. Truley a one of a kind and well worth the wait and search till I found it. I more than highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games were fun to play, others were too hard because of the bad controls. it is addicting though because you have to play so much to get enough pts to buy more games. the amount of pts required keeps going up.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is as close to perfect as a puzzle game can get! It's responsive, fun, the graphics look amazing, and the difficulty lever progresses nicely so that you don't even realize how much more difficult it gets with each level. Plus the added bonus of having more levels appear as the developer creates promises endless fun! It's a steal at only 99 cents! Definitely worth the money!
0345350472|5.0|This is a fantastic science fiction classic from PKD.  It's an easily readable story about a bounty hunter going after renegade androids.  To me, it reads like a Raymond Chandler novel set in the future, with intriguing philosophical themes about existence and identity.  Every sci-fi fan should give this a read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played in the the whole world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! everybody should get this game it is the beast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|The.only.flaw I have with this is that it will not let me set a negative latitude.  otherwise, this is a very well done app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|There are lots of aspects introduced in different levels to keep this simple game addicting. the graphics are great and the game is very entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Some levels are annoying but for the most part I have fun earning the points to unlock more levels and earning achievements, gave it a 5 because it lasts long and is fun, definitely a top free download.
B0058VW36U|5.0|it is an amazing game I I recommend it to everyone who loves games and challenging games to beat. please buy this
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Loved the game ages ago on Windows. This game, in the brief periods it works, is awesome. It keeps locking up my devices: Captivate, Nexus One, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, and Xoom Wifi.
B0013K1ALE|1.0|No one can question the rank and prestige Led Zeppelin deserves in the pantheon of rock. The Beatles, Stones, Who, Sabbath, Zeppelin, and the like. No questions. No ifs ands or buts. Well, one but. The Song Remains the Same is the mighty Zeppelin's thorn. In Chris Welch's book on manager Peter Grant, Grant called it nothing better than an expensive home movie. The fact was, the film was a dysfunctional mess from its conception that the band originally felt nothing but indifference towards. Even hardcore Zep devotees were disappointed - but so were the band members.  In fact, the whole concert had to be recreated at Shepperton Studios after the Madison Square Garden dates in order to add material, fix mistakes, and alter poor performances. Yes, even Zeppelin had to Milli Vanilli overdub/reshoot their own production to salvage the film. And, this was an embarrassment to the band because they were among the most authentic bands of the day. Zeppelin was a band who took pride in the purity of their music. They refused to go on television shows that required them to use canned music to mimic their own music (such as Top of the Pops). In Uncut Magazine's May 2008 issue, Page admitted \\"... I'm sort of miming at Shepperton to what I'd played at Madison Square Garden, but of course, although I've got a rough approximation of what I was playing from night to night, it's not exact. So the film that came out in the '70s is a bit warts-and-all.\\"  One may think that this criticism is mostly for the uninspiring and almost laughable fantasy sequences. Rather, the movie was always deadpanned. And it still is. It was often viewed as self-indulgent. However, for this I defend Zeppelin. Is not rock by its very nature self-indulgent! And if a band deserves a bit of self-indulgence, Zeppelin is arguably just. Yet, all the hoopla about how the updated soundtrack mix, retooling, and surround sound heighten the experience of being at the actual 73 Madison Square Garden concerts is trivial atbest. You hear Shepperton reshoots again and again. As David Cavanaugh in Uncut Magazine said, its a sonic experience of a concert never really heard. Warts and all.  So, there are much better examples of filmed live Led Zeppelin out there. True Zeppelin fans can point you there quickly and honestly. The Song Remains the Same is not one of them. Though Zeppelin's prestige simply cannot be beat by most any other band other than the Beatles or the Stones (maybe The Who on a good night), many agree with Kathleen Carroll of the New York Daily News who was not fooled by the deception and described the film as \\"a hopelessly pretentious piece of trash...in what is laughably called a performance.\\"  Now, that is a bit harsh. Live early 70s Zep is among the best live rock available. This film is still watchable. But, with the caveat that one remembers it is what it is AND it isn't what it isn't. It's a bit like seeing Page's name as the credited writer for Dazed and Confused. Check that one out (hint: Holmes).
B0063IH60K|4.0|Was able to download to Google TV and it works great.  I am not a fan of the ads that pop up (ad for another app, ad for a movie) but guess that's the price for free.
0553582038|5.0|Arrived packaged with another book with no detriment to either. Was sent on time and in great condition, though I wish I could give the book as many stars in a review as I give its delivery.
B005LJJ3IU|1.0|awful, i really couldn't finish watching it, it was that bad.  although i do enjoy a good three stooges film, this is just moronic and truly a waste of ones time.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|After using this DAC for a while, it now does not function properly or convert digital audio and is useless. For some reason, it just stop working. Very unhappy.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My grandchildren recieved this movie for Christmas.  Since then they have watched it at least twice daily. I'm quite certain their parents are getting a little tired of it. But I did give it to the kids.
0307593312|2.0|I really wonder if any of the reviewers in the press actually read this book. I cannot understand the chorus of acclaim for it. The aspects of the plot that are intriguing are buried under endless exposition, silly dialogue and murky description. The goal of this book seems to be to be long, rather than to be exciting, disturbing, interesting, challenging or merely a piece of art. I truly wish that one reviewer in the press had had the courage to say that the emperor was nude before I invested time and money in reading this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Installed on my Fire and it is very fun. It's not hard to earn the points to unlock the other games. I would recommend this game to others.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I saw the movie at the theatre and just had to buy it. I have watched it countless times. Cher is awesome, as usual. Christina blows all current young singers out of the water. I listen to the music from the movie in my car to prepare for my Jazzercise and Zumba classes. Love, love it. By-the-by, I am a grandmother who believes in staying healthy and who has always loved to dance.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The ads are a bit annoying during each game, but overall a decent solitaire game. It is a free game after all.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|This is a blenderful of musical genres. Name it, it's in there but it crafts a  unique and blissful earful experience. Each song takes the listener in new and unexpected directions. The soundscape is sort of pop history through the distortion of a fevered sci-fi addled brain.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|Very enjoyable.  Not your run of the mill romance.  Terrific choice for a quiet evening relaxing on the couch.  I don't have a lot more to say, but Amazon requires 20 words or more. Just rent it, you won't be sorry.
0385738765|4.0|I have not read this book yet i havent got around to it. But i did love the first one in the series so i have high expectations for it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Even though the games are cheesy and low quality, they are still pretty fun... sadly.  I find myself playing them quite a bit.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It's really cool. My husband uses it to be lazy, however. It's great to use to view your docs when you cant get to the computer. It's easy to use and just a really cool remote basically; just for your computer instead of your Tv!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really addiction! !!!!!!!!!!! ! ! ! ! !! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very very fun app that will keep you coming back for hours and hours of fun. I play on my kindle fire and it is great looking
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a Great classic game! Same as the computer version. Good game to play to pass the time. addictive
B005K17RU0|4.0|The only thing that would make this app better is a live radar...but I love everything else about this app.
B005FITIGO|5.0|This film is clinical and gripping at the same time.  It grabbed me from the beginning.  The scene where the employees are being called in to be sacked hit me in the gut.  Seventeen years ago I was riffed at a blue-chip law firm; rumors had been spreading and I knew I was to be one of them.  It was cold and heartless.  The most experienced and higher-paid employees were let go and we immediately had to clear out our desks and lockers.  I barely had time to run around and say goodbye to friends.  You go through that once and the experience never leaves you even though I was lucky to get a job immediately and I've been retired for several years.  That scene just made me relive that agony all over again.  I now know how my father must have felt being laid off during the Great Depression even though he got a job as a printer and eventually was recalled.  (The war helped him be reinstated; war is good for business, at least it was then.)  Kevin Spacey was amazing in his depiction of a man wrestling with his conscience.  The scene where he is crying over the impending death of his dog also hit home.  I understood that perfectly but it also let you into the character of Sam, a man who feels deeply not only about his dog but about the effects on people of what is about to happen and sends him into a crisis of conscience.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand the implications of what is happening.  I can barely understand high finances but I knew right away what was happening.  This is not a film that is easy to watch; it is also a film that cannot be dismissed.  Spacey's performance is worthy of another Oscar.
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|Spolier alert!  Don't read if you don't want to know what happens to Emma!  I was disappointed that this was just another spin on the old, old, very old plot of two people falling madly in love only so that one of them can be creamed by an oncoming truck (or die of consumption, or whatever).  What a waste of time...to become emotionally involved in these two only to watch one of them die violently right in the middle of the story.  It doesn't even seem worth it...Emma dies so that...what...Dex gets to finally \\"grow up?\\" Gimme a break already!  If I had known it was one of those movies, I wouldn't have bothered!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has helped me so much in my studying. I am much more likely to read my Bible having the reminders set and my walk with God had gotten much deeper. Highly recommended for those who want to dive deeper into The Word, and those who need it for their own study purposes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the one I use week in and week out. I have tried others but this one is the best.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its so addicting!!! best app i have!! you will never get bored with this!! i liv it so muchhhhhhh its perfect
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Screw this app! It force closes and the devs haven't fixed it yet come on people! I paid good money for this game!!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I found this app on my LG Optimus T last summer and I liked it and reinstalled it to my Samsung Exhibit II. Now its on my kindle fire and still great. Easy to bookmark, you can search any part of the Bible using key words and so many versions to read from. Reading plans are AWESOME. Only setback though is not having more offline versions available. It'd be awesome to be able to read KJV or WEB underground while I'm on the train. 4 1/2 stars!
B005EXA8XC|1.0|I'm a drummer. Watching a concert where the video of the drummer is a full second behind the audio is unbearable. Regardless of what the product description says above, there IS a problem, clearly. They can claim they've tested it on their own equipment all they want. I invite their experts to enter my living room and watch the unwatchable.  It's a shame really. The concert is quite good.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an ok game . for free it is totally worth getting. might as well get it. 3 out of five
B003Y5H5AG|1.0|My hope was to enjoy campy light childish humor for an hour but Hollywood delivered adult themes & jokes masked in my little blue friends. I intended to purchase this for my friends kid but I don't think it's appropriate for children. I felt like I was watching a long advertisement for specific sets of beliefs about the environment, sorcery, communication, astronomy...   I was a bit taken aback by the way some of the smurfs spoke to one another. It seemed to me as though what was once innocent and friendly is more reflective of society today and not what we'd like our children to emulate. I don't want my friends kid to watch this movie & think that any of this drivel is edifying.
B00005RDSM|5.0|Peter Pan is one hour and sixteen minutes and was released in theaters on February 5, 1953. Peter Pan tells the story of a young boy who refuses to grow up, but at times act likes an adult. The story begins at the home of George and Mary Darling whose three children (Wendy, John, and Michael). After sending the children to bed, George and Mary Darling leave their home to attend a formal party. Peter Pan arrives at the children's nursery to find his shadow. When he does, Wendy offers to sew it on for him. Peter Pan offers to take the children to Never Land and teaches them how to fly as well with faith, hope and some pixie dust from Tinker Bell. By the way to get to Never Land takes the second star to the right and straight on till morning. As soon as they reach Never Land they are fired at by Captain Hook. Captain Hook wants revenge at Peter for cutting off his left hand and feeding it to the crocodile. Peter Pan saves the children. Later in the day Peter Pan rescues Tiger Lily from Captain Hook who wanted her to reveal the location of Peter Pan. Captain Hook eventually does find Peter Pan's hideout and plants a bomb to destroy him. Tinker Bell comes to the rescue and saves Peter Pan. Peter Pan flies over to Captain Hook ship and the two of them have their final fight. In the end Peter Pan takes the children back home.<br /><br />I know I left a lot of the story out but I wanted to add some other information to my review. First this is the first Peter Pan that a male actor played the lead; in previous plays and movies Peter Pan was played by a female. It was Margaret Kerry and not Marilyn Monroe who was the model for Tinker Bell. In keeping with the stage version tradition, Hans Conried voice both George Darling and Captain Hook. Peter Pan was the last movie the Disney's famed \\"Nine Old Men\\" worked on together. Also this was the last movie to be distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. In this film version Tinker Bell actually has a body; in the stage version she was represented by a beam of light. Finally this was Disney's 14th animated feature. Peter Pan is an excellent movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|My wife loves Adele. Hearing and seeing her live is great. She tells some great stories and seems very real on this video. I'm not sure the BlueRay version is worth the extra cost, and the director of this in concert show is more in love with camera moves than Adele. But it is what it is, and not unusual for in concert videos to have less than great directors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Seriously, the You Version app is the best Bible app for any and all platforms. Try to find another better. Thanks, Life Church.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great fun and has lots of games but it is. a little hard but still is really fun
B001N1DPDE|5.0|As I stated in the title, this knife is soooooo nice for what you are paying. Every aspect of the knife is rock solid, in terms of quality. The handle scales are made out nylon polymer. The blade is quite impressive in terms of durability and edge holding value. It is 1/4 inch thick from the end of the handle to the near tip of the blade, after all.<br /><br />Lets get into some detail.<br /><br />This knife was designed to be a utility for camping and survival. It is full tang. With the thickness of the blade and the type of edge it has, makes this knife great for chopping. The only downside to this is that it's going to be a little harder to do finer slicing jobs, like whittling. From what I can tell, that is just about the only common complaint about the knife itself. Other than that, the scales feel really nice comfort wise, everything works really well.<br /><br />There were two types of sheaths produced for this knife, I have the newer sheath, so that is the one I will talk about. Again, it's made from really high quality materials. It is made from a fiberglass reinforced nylon. This means it's solid, ridged, and will stand up to just about anything you throw at it. The knife slides into a skin tight mold, leaving room for no rattle at all. It's held together by six eyelets. It has slots cut out of it along the sides for webbing or storage of 550 cord, so you can wrap it around.<br />One thing I don't like about this sheath.<br />Attached to the body of the sheath there is a removable nylon strapping for a snap, and a belt-carry loop. The snap was intended to further engage the knife to keep it from sliding out. But the way the sheath is designed, that is not a problem, AT ALL. You can swing your arm as hard as you can, that knife is NOT coming out unless you want it to. So I find having that snap there to be quite pointless. In fact I took that part off right away. But with all those eyelets I found it quite easy to fashion my own way to allow the knife to be carried.<br /><br />Bottom line this knife is a BRUTE, it is the knife you don't have to worry about abusing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Amazing price<br />- Amazing quality<br />- Fantastic usability<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Quirky Sheathcarried.<br /><br />Bottom line this knife is a BRUTE, it is the knife you don't have to worry about abusing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Amazing price<br />- Amazing quality<br />- Fantastic usability<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Quirky Sheath
B0063IH60K|3.0|Just good solitaire fun for your kindle fire. Not the best out there but a great free app. User friendly. just get it and see.
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|On a Kindle Fire the app looks great. Lots of Info just don't now what or how it helps me follow anything in everyday life.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is good. ive had fun playing it. I will keep playing it. Not too difficult. Not too easy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games and so do my children!!! They are family oriented and fun, fun, fun!!! Would recommend this app to anyone!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|This mystery game was very fun! It really made you use your mind.  I got stuck on the globe. Hope there is a sequil to this game.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|I read this at around the same time as China Mieville's [[ASIN:B000FBFO8C Perdido Street Station (New Crobuzon)]], and found it far more successful. Mieville's book drags unbearably in its description of entirely fictional and more-or-less alien surroundings. Bacigalupi has a far lighter touch; while he precisely evokes the humidity and misery of Bangkok's summer such that they become almost palpable to the reader, the description doesn't act as a brake on the story, which retains its momentum and nervous energy throughout. It also has a sensuality that Mieville's writing lacks; Bacigalupi understands both the sexiness of the other and how much otherness the id will take.   While very much hard SF in the sense that its scientific basis appears solid and utterly plausible, The Windup Girl would be limited by inclusion in a single genre. It's science fiction in the sense that any novel written these days that has its eyes on the future is of necessity SF, but it isn't larded with genre clichés or the plodding backstory that mars Perdido Street Station. Highly recommended.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|this is a very cool simple little app. it is well worth the .99 if you missed the free app day.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the way the program finishes the game for you.Also when you don't think there's no more moves . you can check with the hit button!  That's s great tool! I play this if Im waiting in line or at the doctors office awesome distraction!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love mini games!  keep on playing until I beat each one. totally worth downloading this game. you will find yourself playing over and over
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I love this app. It does exactly what it said it would and my icons really light up against the dark background!
B004XDYJRU|3.0|This App Was Updated In The Android Market Days Ago. This Is Why I Hate Getting Apps Off Of This Market. The App Is Good, But Could Be A Bit More Simplified Like Pandora. Come On Amazon, Get With The Updates.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this app!!!! All of the games are fun yet challenging but mostly fun(: cant wait til I finish it so o can start over again
B004ECDNJU|5.0|It is a bit difficult at first and I agree with most reviews we need to have time to study the layout before the fire balls start coming. but its overall fun it makes you work for it so it keeps you engaged the entire time! wonderful game if you like a challange. Works great on my kindle fire.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like it a lot beget than the origanal version.  It's a very bright game exactly like the movie.  It deserves a 4 star.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is the best kindle fire game I have downloaded. I love how the mini games are all their own and there aren't two alike.
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|I got this as the free app of the day and thought it was great but it actually installed a spyware-esque app onto my homescreen that lead to searchmobileonline.com. If you are content with that being on your phone this is a great app and the &quot;spyware&quot; app itself is most likely not dangerous, its probably just a third party search engine in which the dev gets a small commission per search or something. But the fact that it is included in here makes it seem very low quality despite the high quality of the app.
B0063IH60K|3.0|After the first few times I played, the adds started to get too annoying to continue. I was interrupted three times every game. It's still a great, classic game if you're willing to deal with the ads. It is free, after all.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|This movie seemed as exciting as a zombie movie without the zombies, as if all the parts that would've given it impact were left out. This is not a film for those who like films with a touch violence and/or gore. I came away feeling as if I'd watched the Disney version of a horror movie. On the other hand if you've somehow missed all the media hype about H1N1 this film might be novel enough.
0307959856|2.0|First Line: It was generally agreed by the female residents of Meryton that Mr. and Mrs. Bennet of Longbourn had been fortunate in the disposal in marriage of four of their five daughters.<br /><br />In her Author's Note, P.D. James apologizes to the shade of Jane Austen who, in her final chapter of Mansfield Park stated, \\"Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery....\\" Although Austen would have no truck with murder, I had the highest of hopes that this Grandmaster of Mystery would mine one of my all-time favorite books-- Pride and Prejudice-- and strike literary gold.<br /><br />The book begins well with gossip of how everyone has fared since the end of Austen's classic, and James did provide a surprise or two. She also proved that her writing could sound like her predecessor's. However, the gossip went on too long, and I was beginning to wonder if anything was going to happen.<br /><br />Finally Lydia arrives at Pemberley in a cloud of dust, the coach rocking wildly, the horses foaming at their bits-- and Lydia screaming and babbling. Captain Denny had the coachman stop in the woods! Denny got out of the carriage! Her dearest Wickham followed! There were shots fired! Her most wonderful Wickham is killed!<br /><br />It is the eve of the ball at Pemberley. Colonel Fitzwilliam and the Bingleys are spending the night. Elizabeth and Jane gather the witless Lydia and take her into the house. Colonel Fitzwilliam gives orders, and he and Darcy have the coachman take them back into the woods. They find Denny dead and a bloodstained Wickham over the body. Wickham mumbles what could be a confession, but since he's three sheets to the wind, Darcy isn't certain. What he is certain of is that Wickham will be going on trial for his life.<br /><br />I realize now that I really didn't know what I expected from this book. Whatever it was, I didn't get it. Austen's marvelous characters are curiously lifeless in Death Comes to Pemberley. Darcy, who thought nothing of taking charge in the matter of Lydia's elopement with Wickham, is quite content to be quiet and on the sidelines here. And Elizabeth? She of the sparkling wit and pithy comments? She practically blends into the wallpaper and scarcely says a thing.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I did feel distinctly cheated, and I worked hard to deduce exactly why I did. I went down a list of \\"I wish___________.\\"  I wish Colonel Fitzwilliam hadn't turned into such a snob. I wish Darcy had shown more backbone and taken a more active part in things. I wish Elizabeth and Jane had done more than play nursemaid to Lydia. Why was everyone so blasted passive?<br /><br />Then it dawned on me. James had to be true not only to the period of time in which the book takes place but to the class of people the Darcys are. A Darcy doesn't turn sleuth and question everybody and look everywhere for clues. That's what those other classes are for. And why-- outside of preserving reputations and social standings-- would they want to help someone like Wickham anyway... a man who'd already tried to bring disgrace to their families?<br /><br />In the end, I found that James stayed true to the era, but it was like wearing a heavy, tight pair of handcuffs. Only Jane Austen, a woman of those times, could have succeeded in writing the type of book I'd anticipated-- and she was wise enough not even to try. I do give credit to James for her attempt. I just wish it had been more successful.uite content to be quiet and on the sidelines here. And Elizabeth? She of the sparkling wit and pithy comments?

B006NXIO0Q|5.0|This is a gret movie to watch when you are looking for a nice balance of action and story. I will say the story could have run a bit deeper but I found the moive very enjoyable. The action is well paced and it does not use the blood all in your face to show it. The means to her targets are well designed and not just a run and gun approach to the killing.<br /><br />You could see though out the movie how she tried to live seprate lives kepping her killing out of the what she was trying to make as a private life. And of course you see what happens when the two hit a merge.<br /><br />The lead had one mission and she held that mission as her driving force even as she battled to justify it with her family.<br /><br />I am sure some will not agree with me but you have to say this movie beats Hanna hands down this movie made Hanna look like some high school project. No this movie will not win Oscars but if it could be done a follow up would be welcomed.<br /><br />I tried not to give anything away in the story watch the movie and you will enjoy it amd many will watch it more then once yes it is that good.

B0053JJLLC|5.0|I could not have enjoyed this book more!  I have passed it on to my daughter to read and know she will enjoy it also.  Lots of action and the story never stops.  I did not want to put it down.  You always have to buy into the \\"world\\" he creates, but once you have done this--it is a great book to read.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed his earlier books.  When I take time and sit down with a book, I want to be entertained and enjoy my time spent reading it.  I did.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great app that passes the time real quick. Only thing is that it could have better hints.
B005QBKXOQ|4.0|Daughtry does it again, I just love his music. He really puts meaning to his lyrics and makes you feel the same thing he is singing about. I would definately recommend this to anyone who is a Daughtry fan
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games, lots of different games and challenges. Good for people of all ages. Good graphics. Would recommend for kids and adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must say I put off reading this book because the subject matter did not appeal to me.  Being a Prime member with a Kindle gave me the perfect opportunity to borrow this book. I was planning to return it immediately if I did not like it. I just returned it after reading it very quickly because I could not put it down.  The characters were amazing and the plot was very compelling.  Now I don't know if I can wait and borrow the next one, or break down and buy it. I broke down and ordered them and here is the rest of my review.  Well, I just finished reading the third in the series of the Hunger Games books. Wow! You cannot skip read or go through them very fast, but need to read every detail. I was going to say I enjoyed the books, but that is not really true. They are extremely well written and very thought provoking. When you start reading them they grip your imagination and you just have to keep reading. But they are not \\"beach books\\" so be warned before you even start because you won't be able to stop.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|so I shouldn't do the up date. I'm just getting the app now and wanted to make sure. most of them say don't so.......
B0063IH60K|4.0|it is a fun game to play while waiting in line or at the doctor. I play it right before bed. love it. has many options to how you can play.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app has hours of entertainment.  Some games are challenging and some are pretty easy if you have just a few minutes to pass.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok game but some of the games are redundant.  I have only unlocked a few games so far but it has been a good time waster
B004DMIIO6|4.0|it took so long to arrive, like two months but i finaly got it, and is areally cool movi, i like it a lot
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a quick read and not easy to put down. I'm not much of a reader, but my wife is trying to get me into it more by choosing items that grab my attention well. Yes, it's more of the young adult category, but this adds to the books ability to quickly get you in and not keep you for too long to make you bored. I absolutely loved this book and have the other two waiting already.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Hands down the best keyboard. I have several keyboards but I only use this one. It is well worth the price.
0062082353|5.0|Unlike many of the posters on this review board, I actually purchased and read this novel.  This is not a political rant nor am I here to assassinate the authors character.  I am going to review the book.<br /><br />Written in a simple form where honesty shines through every comment, this book takes you from the author's experience at BUD's training to his retirement from the US Navy after four tours as a Navy SEAL Sniper.  There are stories in the book that are humorous, there are stories that are sad, and the stories in which SEALs were lost are the most chilling of all.<br /><br />The author is good at his job and is unapologetic about his success.  Please do not mistake that for bragging, he repeatedly thanks the men that he served with, the sophisticated shooting systems he used and luck.  He openly admits he is not the \\"greatest\\" sniper, he gives that accolade to several other snipers who came before him.  Instead, the author reiterates that he has written the book to memorialize the buddies he lost in battle.  They were not honored with the silver star so their stories will never be told.  To honor the men and their sacrifices, he agreed to write the book.  Note that there are two other co-authors credited with this book, for all intents and purposes this story was going to be published one way or another, it seems that having the first person accounts make the book more accurate and realistic.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not point out that this book gives us a glimpse into a very private portion of anyone's life, marriage.  the author's wife speak throughout the book as well.  She gives us an honest and sometimes heart rending view of what it can be like to be married to a man committed to his career.  the ups, downs and eventual success serve as a reminder that our men and women in service are not the only ones to suffer for their commitment to defending our freedom.<br /><br />This is the only comment I will make about the political nature of the war in Iraq.  our soldiers did not ask to be sent over there, but when sent they followed orders and upheld the commitment they made to their country.<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars.  I believe that veterans of any war should be respected.  My grandfather was in the Navy and was at Pearl Harbor, my husband is ex-Navy, and I have a cousin currently serving in the Air Force.  My respect for all who sacrifice and their families knows no bounds.<br /><br />Buy the book.  I think it is interesting, moving and heartfelt.t ask to be sent over there, but when sent they followed orders and upheld the commitment they made to their country.   I gave this book 5 stars.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the apps inside the other apps. I hope whoever get the game is happy with it nice job creators.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm shocked at the sound quality these headphones are delivering. Its beyond my belief that $100 headphones can sound THIS good!! The sound quality just keeps on getting better as these headphones are burning in I can especially hear the base improving dramatically as the headphones are burning in. Over all I rate these headphones 9.6 out of 10! The best I have ever heard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome I love this my friend had it on her DS and I loved it so I bought it for my kindle fire
B003UESJH4|5.0|Movie came brand new, shipped and received very quickly.  It was a perfect transaction, made a perfect Christmas gift.  No problems at all.  Very happy customer.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|When the item arrived it was in perfect condition. It plays perfectly and includes a nice slip cover and a card about how to spot a walker. Perfect for any walking dead fan!
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I love this movie.  Sadly there were no new extras for the BluRay version. Picture is fantastic and so is sound.
B004VFYPTW|3.0|I was not happy after slide it in when Coverdale brought in Sykes who was good<br />for Thin Lizzy at the time but not their best album but the music on 87 Whitesnake<br />was great even though overproduced! I have been a Coverdale fan since Purple days<br />and early Whitesnake. I got use to it but Slip of the Tongue was the final straw.<br />I didn't buy it! Steve Vai again a talented guitartist but not for Whitesnake.<br />Whitesnake became this big hair fast speed guitar band! Now compared to what is<br />out there today I appreciate it more cause I like some of the songs but Steve Vai's<br />playing did not fit and ruin the songs. I know I'll get blasted for this review but<br />after seeing the recent Whitesnake lineup I have to stick to it cause those guys<br />show you can still play fast and be melodic and play great leads and riffs without<br />the twiddly dwiddly bee humming solos! I've had this bootlegged years ago hardly<br />watch it i don't see much improvement on this. BUT if you like the version of the<br />band you will love this especially the close up of Vai who seems to be more than Coverdale!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It totally blew me away with the graphics and the game play. crystal clear and it's just so fun with the features. two thumbs up!!!!
B006BDHAX0|1.0|You just get into a game and it closes.  You can't finish a game. I would like to finish a game.  I would not reccommend this game

B005RZ8WIA|5.0|normally you get band that sound great in the studio but not as good live personally volbeat sounds better live,yes better live!tons of energy and power not just going threw the motions they put on a excellent show with a great misfite cover and acouple guest musicians from anthrax scott and craig and a taste of slayer rain in blood to the human instrument.no they are not the heviest band but they are very original and freash sounding and definitly kick ass hard!if you like their cds you'll love this live disc it's hard hitting and very energetic.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|This film has teamed up two great actors (although some critics says that they lacked chemistry - I disagree). The film has good measures of suspense, action and some emotional depth.<br /><br />The movie (based in 1873, Arizona) starts off with an outlaw [Daniel Craig] that has a strange device around one of his wrists. However, he is unable to remove this object. Just like a typical adventure game, he has no memory of his recent past, as the movie unfolds he begins to get flashbacks.<br /><br />What makes this movie unique is its time setting, hence it does not come across like another one of those alien invasion films that have flooded cinemas over the last couple of years.
B005K17RU0|3.0|this is a good weather app with a very clean User interface the weather videos are nice too. its a little annoying that it always shows up as a notification but that's the biggest knock against it
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This film is very enjoyable to watch. But the hidden messages in this film is where the value really lies. Putting aside all the great eye candy, and it is indeed very good. The film demonstrates the following:<br /><br />- the synergy of team work<br />- not to discount something just on its face value<br />- the rewards of determination<br />- never say die<br /><br />This one is a keeper!
B006PAZMMK|1.0|Sonny just doesn't get it, and frankly, neither does anyone else it seems. I don't think it has come to enough people's attention about this man's difficulty with evolution. Sure, he might have put out a couple of pioneering scenes for the rapidly approaching explosion of dubstep, but other than that, since his first EP's and maybe his famous LP SM&NS, this man has failed to advance to any further level that he started. This album is beyond generic in structure. I got a migraine just listening to the first couple of tracks. Basically, if you've ever heard anything from his first EP, you've heard it all. I'm. Not. Buying this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was surprised to thoroughly enjoy this game!.. haven't put it down for a while now.. love it and would defenetly suggest it
B000007T1M|5.0|S.O.A.D. are undoubtedly gods of metal. This goes by with absolutely no secret considering their lust for outstanding music accompanied by their opinions, be it on war, famine, suicide, religion, or anything that should be important to people. Aside from the wise lyrics comes the band actual music. Honestly, if music was the choice on how good this album is, I could only muster up maybe a 4.5 considering the bands occasional, tendencies to lose control of themselves. You see this first as a bad thing, but ultimately, you can't help but surpass this miniscule ordeal when it comes to astounding performances like \\"Ddevil\\", or \\"Peephole\\". These are the best example of the music that Serj always tried to make himself noticeable, except unlike most musical performances, these actually exemplify pure art! Serj's voice is fantastic in this album, alongside Daron's guitar, which is also at his best considering unlike future albums, he doesn't drown out Shavo. Shavo is another careful addition to this album. Since this is really his last album till STA!, he portrays well skilled bass talents. The intro for \\"Ddevil\\" or the breakdowns in \\"Sugar\\" or \\"Mind\\" truly exemplify Shavo's overlooked talent. The drums are also superb and MAKE the chorus's and breakdowns in this masterpiece. Ultimately, this is S.O.A.D.'s best work to date. I recommend it to anyone.
B005KCZRI8|3.0|But as much as I try I can't even put this in the same category as the first album. The first album was incredible, with every song pretty much being perfect.<br /><br />So when I first heard this album and was disappointed I thought I was being a jerk. There was something I didn't like about the production. And while I wanted to appreciate the new direction the vocals take I was a little dubious.<br /><br />I spent two months playing this album every week. I'm still not really getting in to it. Vomit is good but just seems to go on and on and on. Honey Bunny is nice but doesn't jump out at me. I know I'm supposed to appreciate how they're mixing in a cool, hard rock-deep purple-esque song with Die but for all the force in the guitar the vocals seem to undercut that tension for me.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll get a few dis-agrees here and maybe I deserve it. But whereas Album was album of the year for me in 2009, this didn't even make my top 20 this year.<br /><br />Maybe I'll see them live and love it. They're touring with Real Estate and King Krule right now which would be an incredible show to catch!
B003L77G06|5.0|Product arrived a little later than expected, but it arrived in great conditions. The series itself is awesome, I can't stop laughing every time I watch it.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|love greedy spiders! its a tough logic game with plenty of levels to keep you going. sometimes the screen panning gets annoying but that's the only thing I would change.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I'll start with the seller. Great seller. Super prompt and the DVD was everything it promised to be.(reasonably priced too!) Being an avid Dexter fan, along with several friends, I purchased Season 5 for a friend for Christmas.  It came super fast and was perfect. As soon as I gave it to my friend, she had a Dexter marathon and watched the entire season in a weekend. We both agreed that watching Dexter on DVD is so much better than having to wait a whole week for one little episode. We also agreed that 12 episodes a season just isn't enough...but this seller has nothing to do with that...what he did as a seller was great! You couldn't ask for more. Thanks so much. Added sucess to you in 2012. Lets do business again, any time! Thank U!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can turn on the audio if I don't feel like reading. Can bookmark and  pick up where you left off.

B00631VJIC|5.0|Item was received as described and came much sooner than I expected.  Was super excited to get it.  Made a WONDERFUL christmas gift!
B0007939NO|5.0|I'm a fan of Lerner and Loewe musicals so it's no surprise that I love this movie.  I saw it first several decades ago when I was quite young, and I remember it as being filled with heartbreaking longing.  Sometime after that I was traveling and saw a sign pointing to a town called Brigadoon and I felt the longing again.  Now that I'm old, rewatching it did not inspire the same intense feelings, but it is a perfect, beautiful musical.  It's a story about a magical town that last for a day; the residents cannot leave without destroying the town, and anyone who decides to move there cannot leave either.  So a man hunting in the area with a friend, a man who admits he is uncertain about going through with an impending marriage, meets and falls in love with a woman there, a woman who is four years older than her sister who is getting married that singular day, a woman who has been waiting a very long time to find her true love.  He leaves her and returns to New York but is terribly unhappy so returns to Brigadoon and the romantic love of his life.  The friend Jeff is sarcastically witty, a bit of a drinker, and is pursued by another young woman while he is there.  He is not attracted to her.  To me every detail of this movie is put together perfectly.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Has a few options to deal games. Overall as far as solitaire goes, great game. Easy to play, wins are many and setup looks good
B003BWERF8|4.0|This bluetooth transmitter for iPod worked OK with my iPod Nano 4th generation. Pairing with my 2 different Bluetooth headphones were painless)  Obviously, the transmitter drains the tiny battery of iPod nano much faster but could be less of an issue for iPad or other iPod devices (w/o build-in Bluetooth) with bigger battery.  Secondly, it starts playing back your podcast or random music on your iPod while it is still searching for the Bluetooth headphones. If you leave the transmitter on the iPod (to avoid loosing the tiny device) this may drains the battery when you are not using. I think this is a design flaw.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|The product was fine what I expected from this season my gf like it I bought it for her. Just took 8 days to get to the door I suggest you Pay for quick deliver if you are not a patience person.

B004EFYZ1C|5.0|if you look you can drag the moon to the left and right to show the date, but are these tru?
0312945973|1.0|I TRIED to finish the book, truly I did! I got about halfway through, but finally decided I'd suffered enough! Here I the reasons I dislike this book:<br /><br />Taita is the most ridiculously adept character ever. He \\"reinvents\\" the wheel, designs bows and arrows that are better than any bow and arrow has ever been before, designs and oversees the building of tombs and palaces, designs and creates bas relief carvings, paintings, and pillars in said tombs and palaces, invents medical impliments, performs brain surgery, and even acts as a MIDWIFE. Oh yeah, did I mention HE'S A SLAVE?!? He is supposed to be extremely intelligent, based on the aforementioned activities. Yet, he isn't intelligent enough to accept the offer of his own freedom! He CHOOSES to remain a slave! Weird that...<br /><br />The battle scenes were ridiculously long. The hunting sequences were unpleasantly graphic and unnecessary.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book unless you are incredibly good at suspending disbelief. If you want a truly engrossing and deep story, look elsewhere!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from my friend. I'll admit, it took me awhile to actually go out and buy it, but I'm so glad I did! I was finished with it in a day. There's a strong teen herione who can take care of herself and her family. And what these kids have to go through for the pure entertainment of the citizens of The Capitol isn't too far removed from what goes on now on reality tv (hello Fear Factor) only difference is that people don't die on Fear Factor. So yes, it is a dystopian novel, but one with elements that could easily happen now and not in the far off future. There is, of course, a love story but in my opinion there are many \\"love stories\\" in Hunger Games. Trust me when I tell you, you're going to need a lot of Kleenex!
B00632HWOG|4.0|the Yahoo app worked great on my kindle fire. the only thing I did not like was the notification sound, it scared me the first time i heard it. ( to look at more that ten messages, make it go into landscape mode.)
B0032UYFA6|5.0|A great show with fine actors/actresses, a captivating story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The suspense just keeps building as season 4 ended with the death of the Chicken King drug czar. Best show on television. Can't wair for season 5.
0307120007|5.0|I love  love love this book. Stumbled upon it 26 years ago when my daughter was a baby. I carried it in my diaper bag for all three of my children. It was their favorite from the time they were 6 months old till about 2. Kept their interest for a long time. Its small and convenient to carry. I have bought it to add to several baby gifts over the years. I bought this latest one to share with my new granddaughter who just turned 5 months old. I know she will enjoy it as much as her Mommy did.[[ASIN:0307120007 Pat the Bunny (Touch and Feel Book)]]
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Not as good as the first Band of Brothers.  Way too much cussing and Hollywood influance.  Would have been a lot better if they followed along with the origional Band of Brothers.    However, did get prompt shipping from the supplier!
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|A really solid album with a lot of good music, but only a couple of really outstanding songs. Most of it is pretty much what you would expect from Foo Fighters if they had put this album out 5 years ago. I was hoping they would have evolved a little more, with a little more variation in their sound or composition. The guitar work is great as always, but overall, I am not that impressed, and was hoping for more.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|At first these games were confusing. But starting to get the hang of it. I am hoping they get easier once I learn.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Received the CD in the time estimated and in perfect condition. The CD was originally supposed to ship after Christmas but it got here the week before, excellent!
B004TI5N38|3.0|Good Baldacci read but not his best.  John Puller,superhero & main character was a little too super & over the top for me.  This created some disbelief on my part & caused disinterest in my reading pleasure.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I love Haven. The people are very interesting. I am just waiting for season 2 to come out on DVD so I can buy it.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|. Loved the book. Must read it with a Southern Accent. Makes it so much more fun to read. If you purchased the book share it with your friends and family. They will love you for it
B006SV2LWA|1.0|This movie is your typical end of the world scenario. It is very depressing to watch but not because it is scary but because it is slow and uneventful. Th eside plots are very weak. Gwyneth has a very short role that is summarized at the end of the movie. Its one of those films that you can not wait for the end and when it comes you want your money back. Save your money!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the fact that I can sync notes between my Kindle, Computer, and Android phone. It's pretty nice to be able to collect all of that information in one spot.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Great CD was packaged well and got in a very timely manner was suprised since purchased it thru the hoilday season. Thanks!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's exactly like my phone app, love it. also yes there are ads but that's what you get with a free app.
1419701533|5.0|My grandson is an avid reader, but I didn't know the half of it.  As a retired reading specialist, I couldn't believe that he wanted to read the three \\"Wimpy Kid\\" books that he had seen at school. I ordered the books for him.  I saw that there were five books in the set and immediately ordered it from Amazon.com. I looked at the fifth book in the box, and found that indeed was on the \\"Adult Best Sellers List\\", but was appropriate for middle graders. I gave him the set for Christmas, and his mom sent a picture of him reading on his stomach, and that he had been reading the fifth book for three hours.  There was a lot of laughter and chuckling as he read along, silently. He wanted to finish the fifth book because he had started it at school, but had not read any of the others yet.<br /><br />I see him about once a month, and find he has grown leaps and bounds since the last time I saw him.  Now, I have to see what he is getting from the library before I know what to get for him.  I am so glad that I did buy the books for him.  He loves them, and he knows his grandma is a certified book lover from the beginning of her life of avid reading, and who has passed that love successfully on to other kids.<br /><br />I'm glad I am able to guide my grandson through the help of his parents.<br /><br />Judith S.
6305428387|5.0|This DVD was purchased as a Christmas present.  My kids were so excited to receive this movie -- they love it. It is fun for all ages!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|entertaining for everyone. like the variety of game choices that it offers. something. for everyone. we have not had any problems with it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|We got this set as a family Christmas gift...WE LOVE IT!!! Very cool in blue-ray.  Films are crisp and clear.  A pleasure to see these favorites again.  We were told in BBs this set did not exist so I came home and searched Amazon and BINGO! Thanks Amazon.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|This is the movie that I always tell people to pop in to show their new sound systems, the sound and picture are out of this world, especially on an 110 inch projection screen in blu ray with 7.1 surround sound. Every bullet casing that hits the ground and every fist that impacts flesh, bare or otherwise, sounds perfect. For anyone who wants the ultimate HD movie to show your friends, THIS IS IT!

1612680011|5.0|These people who write bad reviews must be paid. This book is simply a tool to use to change the way you think about money. The poor get poorer and the rich get richer why is that? This book explains why. Its all a state of mind. Poor people play they game not to lose. Rich people play the game to win. Which group you wanna be in? If you are an open-minded person, this mihgt be the best book purchase you ever make.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I think this was the best movie of its kind. Amazon have a good selection of movies. I like the time it was released.
1878424939|1.0|A poorly written self-help book filled with logical fallacies and ridiculous assumptions.  Ruiz spends 138 pages drawing out a message which could be presented neatly on a post-it note.  Unless your life has completely fallen apart and you need to instill an entirely new moral compass, this book won't help you.    To anyone who has called this book \\"eye-opening\\", why were you walking around with your eyes closed in the first place?  You won't learn anything from this book that you couldn't have figured out on your own.  The biggest problem with these new-age self-help books, however, is that the pages are coated in some sort of flame-resistant material.  It's very frustrating to not be able to use this book as a fire-starter.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is by fair the one of the best apps that ive gottten on the market.  It lets me access my desktop easily, and is fairly simple to use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the game. I like the challenge of having. to unlock other games. I would reccomend this game to others
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Outstanding performance!  Reaches the house and the neighbor's with ease and clarity.  Exceeded my expectations!!!!  Works on my friend's old HP desktop with no problems!! Hooked her up so she can surf the net when needed.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app has been invaluable to me. Its ease of use and ability to download various translations have helped me in my studies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a great time waster.  the kids love it and keeps them occupied for hours. would definitely suggest.
B005AAVFDQ|5.0|Everything about this album is fantastic to get the content,4 CDs are each better than the other one more DVD. The highlight is the fourth album (LIVE AT THE PARAMOUNT) which is good from start to finish. The box with the transparent front part is a show that looks good in the room, not counting the finish that was very neat. Simply amazing, I love it.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|I got the app knowing about a few issues and hoping the developer would fix it soon. There was a fix put out the next day in response to the requests.  Pros: It looks nice and does most everything I need. Good response time by the developer. Cons: It got slow as I input all of my items. There isn't a way to do recurring items on a day of the month instead of an interval. (The third Thursday vs. every month which is always on the same day of the month.) Notes are also showing on tasks other than the ones they were saved to. I would give it 4 stars but the slow response (30 seconds to mark something done, for example) is really annoying.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have bought and used several workout DVDs and this is by far my favorite. I do a 20 minute workout right away in the morning and time flies by. Jillian's workouts are EASY to follow which was huge for me..I can never figure out those complicated aerobics steps in some videos. Second of all, she is a great motivator even as a TV personality and I find her attitude to be endearing. I recommend this video to anyone! You don't need a lot of space and five pound weights work perfectly!
1933492953|5.0|This is the first book I've read on composition and I feel I've learned a lot. it's full of beautifully illustrated, clear illustrations and explanations that really show what the author is saying. the examples really make sense, I'd definitely buy this again
B004SIP9U6|5.0|Came in nice and good condition! Thank you very much! I'll be ordering from you from now on. Good timely arrival too.
0439023521|5.0|I simply could not put it down. Great book, well written. I can't wait to read the second one.  I wish i could find more books like this...
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I got the DVD/CD combo pack for my son and what a deal.  The concert is wonderful, Adele gives you her personal stories pertaining to the songs.  The CD is divine.  Adele is a true entertainer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a very addicting app. It is hard to stop playing.Also it is challenging . I recommend. to anybody.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really enjoy having the Bible at my fingertips! The plans are very helpful also...as they provide good circumstancial encouragement for all occasions!
0470449748|4.0|This is the real Holy Grail of GMAT. Even if you are not a fan of official books, you must have this one.  Not many questions are challenging for a 700+ score and you should get a different book to help teach the concepts. Some of the Math instructions simply have example problems. I'd rather learn the \\"why\\" over learning the \\"how\\".  GMAC offers online courses (some free) which use this book as well. So it is a must-have for studying.   I've only been studying for a little over a week, but so far I am happy.  Overall a good book, but not something you can rely on solely.
1594630844|5.0|My grandmother passed away at 101 and she always had great stories to tell us about her life and hardships. The book is divided into several sections that discuss marriage, parenting, life, careers, hardships, and life. The book was full of inspiration, advice, and hardships that can help everyone live a more fulfilling life. Growing up I always thought that my parents just wanted to tell me what to do but I learned to realize what they were just guiding me in the right direction. Reading the book reinforced what they taught me. All the information presented was practical, easy to read, and should be read by a young person to give them a perspective on life. I highly recommend the book and it will give you a little insight on life and how to tackle the challenges that it may throw you.(Reviewed by Eileen- Melissa's Mom)
B004P2CQM4|2.0|I really hate writing a negative review - this product (while challenging to assemble) worked GREAT for the first week or so. Fun to play with and pretty weird seeing a giant fish \\"swimming\\" around the house. The kids (especially my daughter) LOVED this thing and named it, too.  Unfortunately, the tail section is held in place with rubber bands that are \\"anchored\\" to hooks that are literally taped to the sides. I didn't imagine how these would stay on after a while, as the bands were under some tension. They didn't - one popped off after a week and the other a day or two after that. The tape comes off quickly now. We tried using the replacement tape (all the tape comes with the unit) but you shouldn't be required to keep re-taping the hooks.  I suppose if you don't mind looking for tape that may hold better and don't mind re-applying or \\"fixing\\" this frequently it may not be that bad, but the included tape is expectedly light  I hope they improve the design because otherwise this is a winner, but I can't recommend until they do so. The product is fun and a great idea, and I'd like to see the company do well, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I think this CD is a perfect blend of She & Him doing Christmas covers.  I think they are a perfect duet.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|The simplistic gameplay shows the Indies developments at their best.  This game really takes me back to when games were fun, not wasting away your life trying to kill people you barely know on the web...... good job!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A great way to pass the time. Not too hard but still enough of a challenge to keep you trying for that next game unlock...
0385344228|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" grabbed me on the first page and I read the book straight through to the end, all in one weekend.  I might have finished it all in one day had I not been sick.<br /><br />The publisher information says that this book is reminiscent of \\"Presumed Innocent\\" and I can see that, though there are shades of Jodi Picoult as well.  The ending is all Scott Turow but the book in general reminded me of Picoult.  It's a subject matter about which she would have written and in a style that reminded me of her as well.<br /><br />Here's the basics: Andy Barber is an ADA who is investigating a murder. He's taken off the case, however, when his son, Jacob, becomes the prime suspect.  From there Andy, his wife Laurie and Jacob are swept along by how the case unfolds.  Jacob insists he's innocent and Andy believes him. To be honest, I'm not sure if he actually believes Jacob or if he simply will not allow himself any other possibility.<br /><br />What would you do if you were in this situation? It's all too easy to say \\"Well, I'll never BE in that situation.\\" But what if you are? If your child is accused of a heinous crime? How will you behave? What would you do? Andy and Laurie have very different approaches and I bet each of us would have a little of both of them, in this situation.<br /><br />Landay brings us into the story, we root for the characters and are thoroughly surprised to find out we don't know as much as we think.  Sort of like real life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|iota was aweesome lots of fun games to play a lot of different ones top pretty cool. love playing it.
B004EPZ084|4.0|This is a really funny and entertaining movie, without being completely rude and relying on drugged up people.  It is just wacky, with a lot of good lines, and unexpected characters.  Way better than the Hangover movies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun, addictive, entertaining app. Gives you many choices of games but, you can't give up because. you need enough points to unlock more games.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Fit my Verizon iphone 4s perfectly..very secure feeling, corners are a little too pointy for my liking but not a total turnoff.  I gave it to my co-worker and she liked it.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app provides a plethora of games that you can unlock by playing some of the other games or participating in some offers (both paid and free).  It works well on my lower end phone so I doing really understand the &quot;lag&quot; some others seem to be experiencing.  In the end, I removed it due to the questionable ads. You'll get everything from the faux &quot;you've got a message!&quot; pop up to some advertising for mobile porn. Not exactly my cup of tea. Installers beware.

0061122416|5.0|This is a great book! It is rare for a work of simple literary fiction to become an international bestseller. Not since \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" and to a lesser extent \\"Sophie's World\\" has a book achieved this status. If you read \\"The Tipping Point\\" by Malcolm Gladwell, \\"The Alchemist\\" is a book that became a trend and \\"tipped\\" selling more than 30 Million copies (as listed on the cover of  my UK paperback).<br /><br />Written in a simple style similar to Hemingway, this book is easy to read and enjoy. Even though this is a fable about following your dream, I found interesting little tidbits of wisdom thrown in though out the story. Those little \\"nuggets\\" of wisdom that float around in the back of your own mind until he writes one in the story and Bing! You say \\"How True!\\" It is th&iacute;s rare book that makes you think about your own life and the journey you have made sofar.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any one age 12 on up. It is a nice easy read with pearls of wisdom and a simple philosophy hidden within.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I got this on the Deal of the Day for $23. WHAT A STEAL?  You either believe in the Matrix or you don't. Don't kid yourself - if you love this movie, you must purchase this collection on Blu-Ray.

0061564893|1.0|Interesting book, perhaps parts of it are correct, but some are blantantly not. The mylodons were an Ice Age giant sloth that became extinct 10,000 years ago. The remains that Menzies says that are proof of their recent existence have been carbon dated and have been shown to be older than 10k years. Like frozen mammoths in Siberia, mylodon remains have been preserved by the cold in Patagonia. If such an animal existed in Patagonia 500 years ago, there would be numerous skeletons to prove it, but there are none.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game. You start with ten games and have to get points to unlock. You get them from playing the unlocked games, and earn more from reaching a certain goal.  You also can get them by buying them, visiting web sites, signing up for services, or writing a review, like I am doing.
0743435729|5.0|Received promptly and book's condition is as advertised. I am enjoying the Honor Harrington series quite a bit. Very good science fiction.
1577314808|5.0|I have read many books on spiritual development, meditation, and presence.  I believe that the methods outlined in this book may be the simplest and easiest approach I have ever seen for quieting the mind and being in the moment.  When I first started using the methods outlined herein, I noticed a vast sense of peace and relaxation and realized that I was getting almost instantaneous results without much effort on my part at all apart from following the instructions in the book.  This is not rocket science.  It is a very straightforward way to stop your internal chatter, quit worrying, and be fully present, which is a very great gift, indeed!

B00526ZKYS|5.0|Imagine living in a world where Love is a disease called Deliria. Imagine having a procedure that will cure before the Deliria take control of you. Imagine not being able to love, at all. That is the world that Lauren Oliver has created in her fascinating book, Delirium.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book we meet Lena, who is a very headstrong young lady. Life definitely has not been easy for Lena. She has believed all her life that love is something to be terrified of, and that it can kill you if you are not cured. I found Lena to be a very strong character, and I loved that she stuck to her beliefs for so long. Even when she starts to see things differently, she still clings to that belief. I love a character that doesn't give in just after a little persuasion. Of course, things start to change once she meet's and eventually falls in love with Alex.<br /><br />Oh Alex... I have to say, I love, love, love Alex. His character is one that I have thought about long after finishing the book. He definitely stands out to me for some reason, and I seriously cannot stop thinking about him. I adore him, and his relationship with Lena. I love how he shows Lena the truth of how things really are. They are seriously perfect together.<br /><br />Delirium is a very well paced book.  While I wanted to get through it as quickly as possible just to see what was going to happen next, I also wanted to savor every single bit of it. The plot is very creative, and it definitely makes you think. I cannot imagine living in a world where you cannot feel love. That would be just horrible.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite reads, and I can't believe I waited so long to read it!  Lauren Oliver is an amazing author, and I can't wait to read more from her!<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King's voice, and this book isn't a let down. I haven't read all of his books or even most of them. In fact I've probably read fewer than a lot of people, but his style of writing just captivates me. I don't know why because I certainly know that there are writers who are perhaps better technically or artistically, but anyway, Stephen King's great. This book is great too. I love that King doesn't go off on a whole conspiracy theory angle, because honestly when is the conspiracy theory ever correct except in movies? Anyway, read the book! It definitely had me guessing, and I never could quite figure out where the story was going to go. Every time I thought I had it figured out, the story surprised me in some way.   Ok, so sorry if this review sounds too gushy or whatever. I promise, I'm an editor and I could probably write a better review if I wasn't dead tired, but I wanted to add my five-star review. So here it is, and if I come up with something better to say I'll come back and edit it. Final note: read the book!
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is a unique, futuristic take on the classic fairytale that we all know and loved; Cinderella. However, the original fairytale does not hold a candle to this brilliant novel.<br /><br />The characters in the story were really creative, and each in their own way. The main character in the story is Cinder, who is a brilliantly gifted mechanic, who can fix just about anything. Oh, and also, she's a cyborg as well. She lives in an apartment with her two stepsisters, and her stepmother. Cinder is a very strong character that never backs down or gives in. I love Cinder!  The prince in the story is named Kai. I enjoyed his character as well, but at times, I really wanted to ring his neck!  The secondary characters were well written as well, especially the evil characters. (There were quite a few evil characters, and trust me, you will love to hate them.)<br /><br />While a lot of the story is similar to the classic fairytale, it also has its own very creative plot blended in. (I'm trying really hard not to give anything away!) Yes, there is a bit of predictability, but there's still enough added onto the story to keep readers very interested. The plot was very well paced, and I found this to be a very quick read. The ending is definitely a cliffhanger, and will leave you itching to get your hands on the next books. Luckily, this book is the first in a four book series, so we are definitely going to be in for some great reading.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book, and gobbled it up in one day. I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of the books in the series!
1575666286|3.0|I followed the Gerson Therapy for two years; my disease worsened the first six months and held stable for the next 18.  AFter two years of perfect compliance, I didn't feel good and my disease hadn't regressed so I started the Gonzalez Therapy [...] which I learned about in Suzanne Somers' book Knockout.  I learned the hard way that the Gerson Therapy is the antecedent to the Gonzalez Therapy and that the Gonzalez Therapy is much more effective.  After four months on the Gonzalez Therapy, I have more energy than I've had in years and my cancer (multiple myeloma) is melting away.  You can read my blog if you'd like to learn more [...].  Please feel free to contact me via my blog with questions.  Good luck!
B004SIP9MY|5.0|This is my favorite horror movie and has been for a few years now. Good quality and was shipped relatively fast. I am satisfied with the product and the company. I would buy from them again.
1932100660|1.0|Two years ago, in August of '09, I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, incurable cancer of the bone marrow. I passed on conventional medicine and did the Gerson Therapy for two years. It involves 12 vegetable juices a day, coffee enemas and a fruit/vegetable diet. After two years on the therapy, my disease was stable (it worsened the first few months and then held stable) and I was exhausted.    Since I didn't feel well and I hadn't improved, I switched to the Gonzalez protocol and Dr. Gonzalez told me to eat red meat 4-5 times per week plus butter, eggs and dairy; all organic, of course. He prescribes a different diet for everyone based on genetics; some patients are on plant based, raw diets and some eat red meat three times a day. I happen to be in the middle of the vegetarian/carnivore spectrum so I eat a variety of plant and animal foods. Once I moved from a plant based diet to a diet that includes a lot of red meat  and other animal products, my cancer began melting away. You can read about it at [...]. Please feel free to contact me via my blog with questions.    The point here is that a plant based diet works for some but certainly not for everyone. Red meat does not feed cancer.  Cancer is like cockroaches; it'll thrive on anything you feed it.  There are studies that show that sugar, fruit, meat and even Vitamin C feed cancer.  It's a matter of what you choose to believe.  Anyone with a blood disease such as leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma needs red meat, sometimes in very large quantities. If a plant based diet makes you feel great, then that's what you should consume.  But it doesn't work for everyone and it didn't work for me.  I wish that one diet was right for everyone because it would make my life much easier; I would know exactly how to feed my daughters to optimize their health.    The data from Dr. Campbell's China study was first published in the book \\"Diet, Lifestyle and Mortality in China\\".  In many cases, there is no significant correlation between animal protein and cancer.  There is, however, an apparent correlation between sugar and cancer.    I admire and respect Dr. Campbell for his well intentioned efforts to educate his readers about good health and the corruption of the conventional medical system.  Sadly, though, I'm afraid a book like this could do a lot of harm.  Campbell is not a practicing physician and has no real world experience to support his beliefs.    I know this is a sensitive topic.  I thought a fruit/vegetable diet was going to save my life!  The most important thing that each of us can do it tune into our bodies.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a solitaire freak.  When I got the Kindle Fire I began to download a few free apps and I found Spider Solitaire by MobilityWare and I liked it.  Then weeks later, I found Solitaire and it is just as fun as Spider.<br /><br />Both games have nice graphics, run fluently and are easy and fun to play!<br /><br />Best of all they were free games!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The cd was a bit scratched but it still worked alright. The only song that had issues playing was the first one which bummed me out a little but it was a great buy. The cover-book was missing.. (not that it mattered/ didn't buy it for the book!)
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I like this little app.  Not much to it, but looks very nice.<br /><br />When you open it, it will ask for your location (either longitude and latitude or city state) and it shows you the phase of the moon.  You will see the moon as it would look through a telescope.<br /><br />Very sharp and clear picture.  Nice little free app!
B001F6ZIXC|2.0|Just finished watching Pilot. Feel like i have wasted my valuable 1 hour on some boring crap. Also its the same thing we have watched in several movies/tv shows before. Nothing new. I wont be watching it further. not my type.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun little games. good way to burn some time. instructions for the mini games would've been nice. but over all a good app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fast to move through and some are rather addictive. The ads can get annoying but easy to click past. Good way to waste sometime on a layover.
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|Coarse location is more than accurate enough for this app, but it requests GPS location. Additionally, there is absolutely no reason this app should request permission to see my phone number.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|I got this case as a lighter alternative to the case I'm currently using for my Fire.  I used it for the Fire for a few days but found I worried more about how well my Fire was protected inside my woven bag.  I felt this case did a fine job protecting the screen from scratches; it has a snazzy, highly visible color and is lightweight. I like the gripper panel and two-way zipper.  But I carry my Fire in a woven bag that hangs from a shoulder strap and, much as I'd like to go with a lighter-weight cover, I don't think this cover works for my personal situation, although it may at some later date if my bag-style preferences change.  But if you use a backpack or briefcase, or a purse that doesn't get slung about like mine does, this cover has some features that set it apart from its other neoprene cousins.    However, all is not lost!!! When I needed something to contain various \\"card wallets\\" and coin holders, my eye fell on this snazzy pink cover.  I find it's perfect for keeping the various card-clutter solutions that have become the bane of my consumer life in one place without having to dig in six different pockets to pull out the right one.  I have no trouble spotting this container in my bag, and the gripper panel keeps it on the counter while I search for the right wallet and card I need.  Perhaps Belkin might consider customizing this product (Foil-lined perhaps?)and offering it for this use as well as a Kindle cover.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Mobilityware has put together a great game. It is challenging enough to keep you interested but quick enough to fill the periods of down time.
1597801585|5.0|Well this book includes mystery, sci-fi, steampunk and well developed characters all in a distopian future world.  The lead character seems to always have bad luck before his good luck kicks in.  Along the way he keeps running into the wind up girl who in the end, although just a highly modified pleasure machine, show what it really is to be human. Something she will never be.  HIGHLY entertaining
B0054JZC6E|3.0|...impressed with this app. disappointing point accumulation, bit the games themselves aren't so bad once you get past the fact you're going to be playing them over and over and over and over....
B004K4IZ54|1.0|After enjoying my 3-D LG TV for a while, I bought this movie and it is terrible in 3-D! There are points where you're not sure if it's 3-D or not and when you remove the glasses, it's actually a better picture!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101-in-1 Games is awesome! There are so many different games to play all free! How cool is that!!! I honestly believe this is one of the greatest games you can download.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's fun and passes the time when there's nothing else to do at home. it also helps when your baby sitting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game if you don't mind the advertisement every now and then. My kids love it and it the give you options on how you wish to play.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Every single game left me saying maybe the next one wont suck!Then they just got worse.Free is not cheap enough.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|best moon app ever it lets me see moons I could not see before and let me tell you this app is use full
0316017930|4.0|This is a very good book that presents a very intresting theory.  Just remeber it is a theory.  It does not explain everyone:).
B0063GORYU|1.0|I love this app. Would give it 5 stars.  But in addition to the regular ad at the beginning of play, it repeatedly launches a pop up video ad for a horror movie during my game. 3 to 4 times in the middle of the game.  It is making me crazy. I've never seen anything like it.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|It is hard to take this book seriously. There are suggestions of eating ones own babies, collection of foreskins, and killing people that cheat on their partners.    I am perplexed as to how this book has been on the best sellers lists for so long despite the obvious quality problems. It seems to be a direct rip-off of a Hebrew book of the same name. I recommend anything else.    Here's just an example. You've told that you'll go to heaven and meet you loved ones who have already passed. The logistics make this a near impossible feat, especially when the same company can't get things together on the planet!    SPOILER ALERT: Everybody dies in the end, you're most likely to go to hell if you have been alive for more than any period of time (Or by the time you're pre-cum if you follow Catholic dogma.)    I'd recommend ... any other book.
B000KKPN5C|2.0|My SB-400 died after less than 500 shots. Unfortunately, this was long after the warranty was up. It's completely gone--no sounds, no lights.<br /><br />It was an excellent flash. The biggest downside was that it could only bounce the flash off of ceilings in landscape shots. Put your camera vertical, and you can only bounce off of side walls. It doesn't swivel.<br /><br />Unfortunately while looking for a replacement today, I've found that the SB-400 is out of stock at large retailers, and only available at about 50% more than what I got it for in 2008 (and close to what the SB-600 used to go for).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|games are simple and fun great for long rides when you need something to keep you busy great for kids and adults
B0019M2ITY|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my 12 years old daughter. The watch came in on time. My daughter absolutely loves it in spite of the fact that she couldn't wear it until after New Year since we had to go to a local Jewelry store to re-size the band. It is prettier than it appears on the posted pictures.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I have to say this one is great if you like mysteries/horror/action films. It is a bit on the creepy side, but has amazing music. Definately one worth watching!
B0063IH60K|1.0|The ads are popping up all over the place, including after I quit the app. is this what android apps are like? this mess would be booted out of the itunes store, where not coincidentally,  there are much better card games. it would be an okay game, but for the ads taking over my kindle fire.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I bought this when it was $2.99, and for that price I am happy with it. I do not think I would have payed $9.99 for it.   Overall it was interesting, however, like some other people mentioned, I did not entirely click with Lena and Alex's relationship. I felt like it was kind of rushed in some parts...I dunno.   SPOILERS...kinda?  Lena herself kind of irritated me, she seemed a little too dependent on Alex to rescue her (near the end). I also thought it a bit odd that she actually ran at the end. Which is, I think, another reason why I didn't really connect with her relationship with Alex.   Those are just the things that irritated me, however there was more good than irritating. I think I will read the next one, but I'll probably wait for it to go on sale too.
B003UESJHE|2.0|Maybe I was hoping for too much since this movie won best picture but really did not find it that great.  Think with a few adjustments here or there it had the potential to be much better in my opinion.  Got a little bored in the middle of it.  There have been a few past winners of best picture film that I did not find very interesting.  Obviously, many people disagreed with me.  If you like history type dramas then give it a try for yourself if you have not seen it.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some r lame others are better good game all in all tho wish I you could play a sample run if the games before unlocking hate it when you unlock a bad game
B005LAJ16I|5.0|For those of you who have not sen Homeland, the best new show this year, do yourself a favor and see it.  I heard a lot about this show, but knew absolutely nothing about it except everyone said it was like 24.  While that is not quite right, it is close.  It actually is more like The Manchurian Candidate.  I equate 24 more to action while this is suspense.  I don't want to give anything away and blow such an excellent plot, but suffice to say, brainwashing and suspense are heavily in play here.  A fine cast that includes Claire Danes as the most unhinged federal agent you are likely to see, Mandy Pitinkin (Princess Bride and Dead Like Me) puts in his usual incredible performance, and all the rest.  There is not a dud in the whole cast, and unlike a lot of these spy thrillers, this comes closer to real life than most, or at least feels that way.  See it.  You won't be disappointed.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Good CD with several enjoyable songs that have not been played on the radio.  Not as good as her last one though.
B0028T6XXY|1.0|I ordered Michael Buble CDs.  The Christmas CD worked perfectly and we enjoyed it greatly over the holidays.  The other set of CDs (Michael Buble Meets Madison Square Garden) however, we have never listened to because they do not play on any of our CD players.  It's as though there's nothing on the CD.  Very disappointing.
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|More mellow than prior Kid Rock CD's and has more of a country southern rock theme to it more so than the harder core rock/hip-hop which I like.
B004SKIPXW|3.0|Full of action,plus Nick Cage is pretty good in this one(he has made some stinkers recently),all in all, a good b rated thrill ride.The 3D was good,not great and the price is right.I enjoy the good animated 3D movies(Coraline being the heavyweight champion)but I also enjoy a \\"real people\\"3D movie,and this one is pretty good.    )
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This classic mafiaoso movie is even better on blu-ray.  The enhancements are outstanding.  We own about 20 copies of this movie, in all disciplines, and outside of the chronological version, this is, by far, our favourite.  OUTSTANDING AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0045I6X90|5.0|I really liked the cd. It was an amazing price and I would use Amazon again.It came promptly after purchase.
0316056863|3.0|I love Tina Fey. I think she is funny and couldn't wait to read this book. I did not like it. In fact, I could not get all the way through it. It is a slow read. Granted there are funny parts, but overall the book was not good. If you want to read it, get it from the Library...don't buy it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset because I needed something to drown out outside noise but also be comfortable enough to stand wearing for anywhere from one hour to four.<br /><br />After I got this headset and installed the software (was a breeze on a 64bit machine) I plugged it in and started using it!  It was VERY easy to install and use and the voice changing software provides non-stop hilarity!  I also liked that there are three buttons you can bind to any three things you want really.  I use one to open my iTunes software, the other as a key bind to speak on a voice chat communications software (for those times you need to leave the computer but still want to be in on the conversation) and the third I haven't really bound to anything yet.<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic, I must say.  Especially for this price range!  I also have somewhat of a large head for most females and not a lot of headsets can be worn for very long on this melon without causing some serious discomfort.  With this headset I can wear it for several hours without it being too uncomfortable.  Nothing in life is absolute so there are times that it's not super squishy but a little readjusting on my head and we're back in comfortable business again.<br /><br />The mic has a little red dot on it that when you swing the boom up it mutes you automatically and the red light comes on, when you pull it down, it goes off and you are back in speaking business again.<br /><br />Overall I am completely happy with my purchase and can't say anything bad about them!  I mean I'm a Logitech loyalist anyways and I tried the G330 headset but with it sitting on my ears like that after about 25 minutes my head started to ache so this is the way to go if you're looking for comfort over long periods of use!
1451627289|5.0|Everyone has already said it... this is the best SK novel yet. Easily a favorite, and I can't wait to turn around and read it all over again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good clean version of the game. minor ads here and there but not bad. overall it is well done and I have fun playing this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a lot of fun. enjoy playing the games and trying to unlock more. my seven year old enjoys it too! great time waster!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game very fun and also very very very very very very very very very very very very very addicting
B004SIP8QQ|4.0|KB1 was truly bad and while this is the second segement of a \\"single\\" picture, there is no question which half QT should have left on the cutting floor. KB2 has a good story and the violence is integral and not the odd ball gore fest presented in KB1.
B001USHRCK|5.0|My daughter loves legos.  She has gone through a few steps first.  Her first set was bagged and told her to do this bag first and so on.  Her next set she had to divide them up herself, but there were about half the number of legos.  This one she has divided up the legos into baggies by herself and has built one portion.  I made sure she understood she was not to finish this quickly and to enjoy building. You must have a place to keep this set out as your child works on it.  What she loves about this one is the \\"storytelling\\" she will be able to do with it.  She is slowly outgrowing barbies, but still loves to create stories for characters.  That is why this set was good for a girl vs. a machine/star wars model. Also, I think it helped that her brother shouted, My goodness do you know how much that thing cost!!!  Worth every penny.
B0063GORYU|1.0|This game was ok until recently when it would start cutting out mid game to show a movie preview.  I am going to find another version and dump this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app,use it daily.  I like being able to download versions to read offline. I just wish more versions were available offline.  The various plans an ability to take notes are an added plus.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun to play. everyone in my family likes it. I think every one should have this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This ap is fun. Has a variety of fun easy games. You always have something to choose from. Great job.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a great game to pass time but it is sometimes a little slow so if you like mini games then I think this game is great for you
1609611543|5.0|For years I've struggled to lose weight and could never understand why despite daily exercise, lots of fruits and veggies (even going vegan at one point), and whole grainis, I just could never feel my healthiest. After buying this book on Amazon, I have found what works for me! I've been wheat free for 2 months now and feel amazing. I'm actually finding a paleo diet is what works for my body the best, but Wheat Belly was the catalyst to start this transformation. I sleep like a rock, I have energy, am able to work out harder and really have lost all cravings for junk. For so long I felt like my turkey and veggie sandwich on whole wheat was the perfect dinner, but boy was I wrong. I rarely have acide reflux anymore, my sensitive skin is no longer an issue and my clothes have never fit better. Can't say enough good things about this book and the positive effect it has had for me. I hope others who have struggled with their health and have an interest in this topic get the same results!
0060090367|5.0|Can't even imagine how some people didn't enjoy this book, but then some people hate sunshine, ice cream and the Beatles.  What can you do.  Great book, love her style!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Very well done.  My kids (4 & 7) took to it right away with minimal instruction.  I have tried three or four other drawing apps but none we as easy and fully featured as this one.  Very excellent design.  I'll have to see if there are other titles by this company.  Very impressed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love It! I enjoy the game a lot! I play it a the time! There are no mistake I can see
0374275637|3.0|The author is a Nobel Laureate and one of the foremost expert in Psychology.<br /><br />The book provides a nice overview and fine examples on how the human mind works. Great. So what about practical application of the knowledge? Too bad, you would need to figure THAT out on your own.<br /><br />One of the principle features of the human mind, the book states, is that our mind is inherently (by default) lazy. And my lazy mind also wants to know how I can apply the precious and expert knowledge presented in this book into something useful. Instead, what I did get endless pages of Psychological research and examples which easily could have condensed into less than 100 pages. If you hated Psychology in college, then you will most definitely hate this book. I loved Psychology and even I became tired of reading endless pages of theoretical and empirical psychology and examples.<br /><br />To be fair, academic Psychologists very rarely write on matters or provide suggestions that have no empirical or statistical basis. In other words, they don't provide advice, even good ones.<br /><br />But I think that is better than the NLP Psychologists (most of whom don't have PhD in Psychology) whose writing tends to be long on advice and short on research.<br /><br />Fun and entertaining this book isn't. Insightful it is. Useful? If you think very hard and use your System 2 to a great effect, maybe.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this Bible app on all my media devises; droid phone, Kindle Fire,  iPod, iPad etc...... God has absolutely allowed/created this as a gift, because it works seemlessly on all devises every time I want &amp;/or need it work. There's no other app anywhere that I can say that about or devise for that matter.I am in it several times a day, it ALWAYS works. its also very cool &amp; very helpful to have access to other versions.  Thank You for building, maintaining &amp; sharing this Bible application.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not the best of games out there but its good enough. its more of an average game. gotta unlock them all.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|So far this app is the only one I've found that lets me to stream my Windows Media files onto my Kindle Fire.  It does a pretty decent job of that...a few bugs, but pretty decent.<br /><br />So I had a minor problem/question and went to the aVia website to ask about it, maybe get an email addy, but I found that there is no way to actually contact a human being to ask a quesiton. But I could post on the \\"Forum\\".  No, I can't post on the forum.  Went through the whole forum-registration process and then...nothing.  No \\"validating\\" email, no \\"permission\\" to post on the forum.  And apparently no other way to contact anybody.<br /><br />It's a free app so I probably shouldn't complain, but geeze...no support at all?
0767847431|3.0|Ray Harryhausen's movies, though his claymation art was pretty advanced in the sixties with \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\", it doesn't ever seem to improve so it started to look pretty outdated even in the mid seventies.  If it wasn't for the interesting story that \\"Clash of The Titans\\" was in 1981, I would have laughed hysterically at the lame claymation effects of that film.<br /><br />But, what compelled me to watch this film of \\"The Golden Voyage of Sinbad\\" was that it starred the buxom beauty Caroline Munro.  That was fabulous casting and with her awesome costume for the film, I had to watch this film twice.  With her exciting low cut cleavage exposing the shiny sweat running down the valley of her curvacious gland canyons would make any post-pubescent teen hungry for more.<br /><br />Yes, there is so much outdated special effects here, but you have to watch this movie for the sake of following a story.  Caroline Munro helped it maintain my interest.
B004TI5N38|1.0|I've long been a fan of the Camel Club series, but this was horrible. \\"Zero Day\\" is by far the worst of the worst of Baldacci's works. The dialogue was pathetic, the plot was unispired and disappointing, and the characters were ill-concieved. I'm curious as to why the town and county in WV were made up when most of Baldacci's other books are so accurate. Maybe he didn't feel like leaving the comfy DC-metro bubble to travel to the hills. I'm hoping for better next time, but it will be a while before I pick up another one of his books.
B005GVF95O|3.0|my two yr old seems to like the game, but I noticed that the game doesn't seem to support multi touch on the screen so with my daughter she had trouble holding the phone and not touching the screen with her other hand which made the puzzle pieces impossible to move.
1456407872|4.0|I ordered this paperback copy of A Christmas Carol because my old hardcover copy was showing its age.  The book is a nice easy holiday read and this paperback makes it a nice affordable read.  This edition has no illustrations, so younger readers might enjoy another version.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a great game - good graphics &amp; works great on the Fire. My only complaint is that it was too short &amp; that's why I gave it 4 stars &amp; not 5.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game itself is great, plays well on Droid 2 global. Would have given 5 stars if not for the horrible ads, those between games is one thing and easy enough to ignore. However, there are also ads that pop up at random in the middle of a game.

On every other device I have tried, it is perfectly fine, including my Droid Incredible 1.  When connecting, the Kindle Fire app shows the connection as being yellow, not green like my Droid Incredible.  I don't know if this is a Fire problem or a Plex problem.

B004XJHBCE|2.0|Just got the new update for what has been an incredible app for the quite sometime, however the new update is really causing me to consider deleting it from my phone.  I understand that your trying to make this app more streamlined for novice users and technophobes, but some people already know how to make nested categories with a previous menu button.  I'm one of these people, and prohibiting me from removing or at least altering the position of the automated previous menu button is very bothersome, as the best thing about this app until now is the level of customization and control the user has.  I understand that you think having the button stay in one static position is what most users want, but some of us like previous menu buttons wherever we please.  Please address this issue promptly, because I now hate what has been the primary layout directory that I use for my phone.  Leave the power of choice to the end user always.    Fix this issue, so this feels like a 5 star App again.

1451627289|5.0|Time travel is great to think about but the care taken to examine Lee Harvey Oswald was profound.

0312641893|5.0|Being cyborg means being owned. Not quite human and not quite android, Cinder serves her family in their marketplace stall as one of the best mechanics in New Beijing. Her skill leads the prince to bring an ancient android no one on his staff has been able to repair to her stall. But what could the future emperor need with an old tutor robot?<br /><br />As plague strikes the market and Cinder's 'step-mother', Adri, and 'sisters', Pearl and Peony, prepare for the upcoming ball celebrating the end of World War IV decades ago Cinder's life takes on a new purpose. Her fate tied to the possibility of a cure for the plague and a growing friendship with the prince will put her in danger of more than just being given away as a test subject by her stepmother. Cinder's existence may threaten the only real enemy worth fearing.<br /><br />It isn't every day an author can pull off a flawlessly genre-bending, roller-coaster ride of young adult fiction. Watch out, because here comes Marissa Meyer. Taking a classic fairytale and turning it on its ear in all the right ways she manages to make a classic cool again. Melding futuristic tech with a dash of dystopian flavor, a subtle sprinkling of romance and enough fantasy to give it a twist Cinder is an adventure I almost couldn't put down.<br /><br />Just when you'll think Meyer has taken you off the path of the classic Cinderella format a clever twist brings it back on track. At the same time she manages to make each character in the story unique, interesting and just enough like their fairytale counterpart to be obvious. Prince Kai is handsome and intelligent, a stronger figure than the original Prince Charming, and Iko, the little android with a big personality, is sure to win a fan following.<br /><br />To sum it up, if you love any of the elements this story contains you are sure to love Cinder. It's smart with just the right amount of humor and sadness, in spite of being, in essence, a retelling it's as fresh and original as it can get. I am so anxious to read the next Lunar Chronicles novel, Scarlet, a Little Red Riding Hood retelling. Meyer is going on my auto-buy list.xt Lunar Chronicles novel, Scarlet, a Little Red Riding Hood retelling. Meyer is going on my auto-buy list.

B000JIHP88|3.0|I loved this mobile, but had to return it because it does not fit safely on my crib.  The locking mechanism does not seem very sturdy and is about 3-4 inches wide, so it will not work on a crib rail that is wider.  It also would not work on a curved crib railing. I wish it had a better attachment so that I could keep it, but it does present a safety hazard on some cribs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Pretty explainable.<br />Helpful musts for new players. Don't skip on the instructions for each game like I did. Tried jumping right into different games and found myself completely lost or at least distracted enough as to waste much-needed time to successfully complete each game. Excellent games nonetheless
B0062P332Y|5.0|Full of action with a great cast.  This movie has a good, interesting story to it and what I liked the most is that the action is spilled throughout the movie. If you love great action movies, this is one you don't wanna miss out on!

0810989956|5.0|I am 15 years old and bought this book, and it's so much fun, I'm occupied all the time at school, and whenever I'm bored at home. I love drawing and journaling, and I've been a fan of the series since the first book came out, but now that I'm 15, I am NOT ready to let go of this series. This book gave me such a good time!
B003L77G6K|5.0|First of all, The Big Bang Theory is one of today's best shows on TV.  Reliving the past season on a Blu Ray disc is even better than watching it the first time around.

B004ZG5F28|5.0|Finally we get the superb romantic comedy BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY on blu ray.  It has been a long time coming for all of its fans and the first question will of course be whether it is worth double dipping.  How much better is the blu ray presentation than the dvd.  I can happily say it far surpasses it.  I want to start by saying this splendid film has in no way aged and the story rings true as fresh as ever.  And this film is in no way just a chick flick.  Yes, it is a romantic comedy but it has a depth and realism that makes it something both women and men will like.  Renee Zellweger reigns supreme here as Bridget and provides slapstick comedy at its best while making you love and care for her underdog character.  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are superbly cast as the male leads and the romantic foils for Bridget.  This is indeed a truly heartwarming tale.<br /><br />Now for the blu ray.  I was very excited to see how pristine the video presentation is.  Colors pop brightly and skin tones are fresh and natural.  Black/white ratio is excellent.  The clarity and crispness is certainly what brings this film to new life.  The audio is 5.1 DTS-HD Master and works superbly.  Dialogue is always strong and present and the surround speakers get good use when need be.  But the music is a big part of this film and represents each milestone in Bridget's journey from Chaka Khan to Diana Ross and in those moments all the speakers come to life in  a glorious style that raises the emotional level of this film to an even higher caliber.  BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a superb film that gains new life with its blu ray release.  I highly recommend it.
0143038419|5.0|Brava, Liz! It takes real guts to admit one's failings, to travel into the unknown in seach of one's self who can't quite be trusted, and then to write it all up in a funny, self-deprecating, honest account of what actually happened out there, so that others who would have liked to jump ship but stayed at home can have the vicarious fire-side armchair pleasures of all the hard-earned discoveries.   An easily digested read with a lasting and satisfying aftertaste, like the best Italian meal.

B000BHHVPO|3.0|First I want to say that that this product is a solid 3 stars.  The musical performances vary in quality and entertainment. But personally I didn't care for many of the so-called 'artists.'  I bought this solely for Pink Floyd's 5 song set.  The songs that Floyd performs are Speak to Me, Breathe, Money, Wish You Were Here and Comfortably Numb and they do them all flawlessly.  Seeing roger Waters into the music, smiling, singing along and engaging the audience is fantastic.  Seeing all four members smiling to one another and standing together at the end is truly priceless.  To say the least it was and will remain very emotional to any committed fan of Pink Floyd.  However if, like me, you are only getting this to see Floyd then I suggest you simply check out David Gilmour's Youtube channel where he provides the entire performance in HD and FREE OF CHARGE.  So if you only want the five songs from Pink Floyd just skip this DVD and watch it on Youtube.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|In this book, Collins tells the story of Katniss, a young girl competing in \\"The Hunger Games,\\" a cruel, government-orchestrated fight to the death. The plot is as compelling as it is unsettling.<br /><br />This is a book you can't put down. The writing is excellent and the pacing flawless. The characters in general are nicely wrought. Collins keeps the reader fully engaged, trying to interpret and anticipate the moves of both the gamemakers and the competitors.<br /><br />Despite the wonderful experience of reading this book, I began to feel a sense of unease in the last thirty or so pages, the fear that I was about to be seriously disappointed. I hoped I was wrong. But I wasn't. I hated the ending. It resolved nothing.<br /><br />While I realize this is a series and the action resumes in \\"Catching Fire\\" and continues in \\"Mockingjay,\\" I feel authors of series works owe it to their readers to reward them at the end of each book with some overwhelming emotion, good or bad. In an epic story such as this, there needs to be some sense that the protagonist has come through some major life event that has changed him or her, prompted some sort of growth or... something. The unfeeling, jaded Katniss of Page 1 is pretty much the same girl the reader's left with on the last page. She's likable enough but still self-centered, still terribly immature and self-congratulatory. How much can the reader really care about this character and her relationships with others when, in the end, Katniss herself really doesn't much give a crap? And at the end, the story just... fizzles. I have a strong sense that this book ended at the wrong place. There needs to be some sense of closure, some feeling that the reader has completed a book. And, in the case of a series novel, there needs to be some major driving element that pushes the reader into wanting to read the next book. A bunch of unresolved loose ends, vague questions, and protagonist ambivalence, as we get here, simply is not good enough.<br /><br />The ending here was so BLAH that I was left seriously questioning whether I wanted to invest the necessary time to keep reading the series. I thought Collins and I might have different views as to what constitutes a book ending. What if the difficulty with endings was systemic and I got to the end of \\"Mockingjay\\" and was left going, \\"Whaaaaattt?\\"<br /><br />No reader wants to be left that way.<br /><br />But I cared about this series. I would love to love it.<br /><br />I decided to check out the reviews for \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\" before I went any further with this series. I needed to know whether readers were more satisfied with the endings of \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\" than I was with the ending of \\"The Hunger Games.\\" If they weren't, then I was unlikely to read those books.<br /><br />In fact, I wish I'd checked out those reviews before I started the series.<br /><br />Having completed my review of the reviews, I would suggest that strategy to anyone contemplating reading \\"The Hunger Games.\\" That way, you'll know what you're getting into before you're where I am now.<br /><br />Eventually, nostalgia may pull me back to the series and I'll pick up Book II. Right now, though, I feel too cheated and disappointed.<br /><br />With just a little more effort on the part of the author and editors, this could have been a phenomenal book.LAH that I was left seriously questioning whether I wanted to invest the necessary time to keep reading the series.

B003K16P3M|5.0|Imagine you're a 8-year-old girl and a lecherous older man reaches toward you, intending -- well, nothing good. You lash out at him and he falls dead at your feet. From that moment, you're feared and shunned for your special talent: killing.<br /><br />Thus is the life of Katsa, niece to the king of Sundoria. She is a Graceling, a child born strongly talented in at least one way. Gracelings are easily identified by their eyes, which are two different colors. Easily identified, in Katsa's case, means easily ostracized. It doesn't help that her uncle uses her to abuse and frighten those who cross him.<br /><br />With few friends to call her own, the appearance of Po, a Lienid prince and a fellow Graceling, shakes her world. He's gifted at fighting, which means he can hold his own against her. Somewhat. But Po's gift goes beyond mere fighting, and Katsa's discovery of its true nature -- and her decision to accompany him on his investigation of his grandfather's kidnapping -- changes both their lives.<br /><br />\\"Graceling\\" stuck with me. Katsa starts as a wounded, half-formed character who is so frustrated by her life that she can't even put it into words. She hates what her uncle asks her to do and the lack of control she has over her own life, but she sees no way out:<br /><br />  \\"Who are these fools who continue to resist Randa's will? Haven't they heard the stories? Don't they know he'll send me?\\"<br />  \\"Isn't it in your power to refuse?\\" Po asked. \\"How can anyone force you to do anything?\\"<br />  The fire burst into her throat and choked her. \\"He is the king. And you're a fool, too, if you think I have choice in the matter.\\"<br />  \\"But you do have choice. He's not the one who makes you savage. You make yourself savage, when you bend yourself to his will.\\"<br /><br />With the slightest nudge from her friends, she breaks away from her uncle's control and blossoms into a pretty kick-ass heroine. It takes the better part of the book, as it should. All the while, Cashore avoids the temptation of letting Katsa slip into more traditional female roles -- she doesn't come to relish pretty clothes or getting dolled up, nor does she relent on her determination to remain unmarried. It's refreshingly true to her bone-deep and oft-repeated desire to never let another person dictate her fate.<br /><br />Some stories look like they'll be a light, entertaining read and leave you considering, seriously, what it would be like to walk in their characters' shoes. \\"Graceling,\\" to my surprise, was one of those books.<br /><br />\\"Graceling\\" is listed as a young adult/children's novel, but the writing and the handling of some pretty mature themes make it an enjoyable read for adults. Teenagers/children reading this book will encounter at least one obvious, but not graphic, sex scene.traditional female roles -- she doesn't come to relish pretty clothes or getting dolled up, nor does she relent on her determination to remain unmarried.

It was thrilling, emotional, gripping, and all around the best book of 2011. Many people compare it to the next Twilight, but it is not at all. This book has an actual premise and the characters are like people you've known all your life. The plot development of this book is completely riveting and once you start I guarantee you, you will not close it until you finish the whole thing.

B005FISBTO|3.0|I've given you a full couple weeks to be ready for this. I'm going to talk about the recently ended season of Dexter. There will be spoilers. Oh yes, there will be spoilers. As a primer, you may want to look at what I've already said of this season, here.<br /><br />As far as seasons of Dexter go, this the sixth season I feel was middling. But I think even a middling season of Dexter is still a strong contender for your TV viewing time. Thinking back on this season it feels a lot happened, but not a whole lot of much importance. The big bad was interesting, and there was some intriguing development going on outside of the main arc, but a lot of the rest of what happened either hasn't come to fruition yet or is all sound and fury.<br /><br />So lets start by looking over some of the key B plots, then we can end big by looking at the big bad and the finale.<br /><br />LaGuerta, as always, is looking out for LaGuerta. She and Angel have divorced in between seasons, their marriage may have been as legitimate as a Kardashian's, once it stopped paying off for her it was time to call it quits. In typical fashion, she was able to blackmail her way into a promotion to captain. Just as things seemed to be coming up all LaGuerta her maneuverings were stymied a touch as Deborah was promoted into her vacated position rather than Angel as she had planned. The only really important things to take away from this is Deb is now LT and LaGuerta is a hardcore manipulative bitch. Both of things will continue to effect the season and onward.<br /><br />Quinn and Deb are still a thing. For about an episode anyway. Then he has to ruin it all by doing something as silly as propose. They break up and she becomes his boss. Quinn being the rational adult he is handles it quite well as step by self destructive step he fills his life with booze and whores. Being the consummate professional these habits never effect his work life, except for every time we see him, all culminating to Angel nearly getting killed.<br /><br />Masuka continues to be your comic relief. And now he's got college students. It's a surprise to no one that he offers his intern position to the class sexpot. Neither should his advances on her be much of a surprise. What may have been surprising is her reciprocation. Also that she stole a key piece of old evidence, namely the mannequin hand from the Ice Truck Killer case. Sexpot is let go, and Masuka drafts Louis to fill her shoes, and cover up her theft, a task which he conveniently proves to be very adept at.<br /><br />That's when the Louis thread slowly starts to get a little weird. He starts to date Angel's sister Jamie the uber-sitter, good on `im, we learn he's developing a Serial Killer video game, oh and he has the mannequin hand. Dexter berates him for wasting his life creating such a sick piece of software. Dexter's words have something of an effect on Louis, but I'm not sure if I've decided what exactly he's playing at. He shelves the game, devotes himself to working for the department, and anonymously mails the hand to Dexter, but not before drawing deliberate palm lines on it. This is actually one of the items I'm curious to see handled next season, as Dexter never has a chance to see the hand before the events of the finale. I don't have much of a clue as to what it's supposed to mean, and I am left to wonder if Louis' change of heart stems from him being suspicious of Dexter.<br /><br />Dexter finds religion. Well, not in the way you're thinking, but religion permeated this season in an odd way. Dexter decides he should enroll his son Harrison in a Catholic preschool. This plan hit a minor speed bump when the school finds Dexter is completely without faith, but our favorite vigilante is able to overcome such minor details. Dexter makes a new friend in reformed criminal turned man of god Brother Sam. Brother Sam was a brief source of light and hope to Dexter, who encouraged him to find the good in himself. What light he kindled was exterminated when Sam came to an untimely end. Things never end well for friends of Dexter. And of course there was the overtly old testament nature of the Doomsday Killer, our big bad, but we're not quite there yet.<br /><br />Deborah, after involvement in a shootout, seeks some mandated counseling. She does her time, but discovers herself unraveling and issues pouring out of her into her therapist. May be that after all she's been through she needs some therapy. Her big breakthrough might not be what you'd expect. Turns out she's in love with her adoptive brother. Makes a sort of sense, really, everyone she's ever been with has either been very much like Dexter or very much not Dexter. Also keep in mind he is her adopted brother. So it's okay to think this is hot.<br /><br />The Doomsday Killer. As far as big bad's go, this season's was one of the more interesting. And likely the most insane, though not at first glance, and Doomsday evolved in unexpected ways. In the beginning we had a duo of religious zealots working to bring the end of the world by reenacting biblical passages in gruesome tableaux. Honestly, the dynamic between master and pupil was different at first as we've never been shown a team of killers but seemed a little uninspired. They seemed a little wooden. I can't tell you if that was by design or not.<br /><br />Then we had the student questioning his master, and the righteousness of their cause. Things started getting a little more interesting here as you could see that Travis was losing faith in Gellar and it was only a matter of time before he defied his dark master. Dexter was more than willing to help. In Travis, Dexter saw a chance he never had in himself. If Dexter could kill Gellar while Travis was still innocent, he could rid Travis of his Dark Passenger in a way Dexter could never be rid of his.<br /><br />But, in one of this show's greatest twists, we see Travis is a one-winged angel, and is quite insane. Gellar has been dead for some time, by Travis' hand, and Travis has been single-handedly working to bring about the doomsday since day one.<br /><br />In the final moments of the season Travis ends, of course, on Dexter's table as the show delivers on a promise made several times over several seasons. Deborah walks in on him in the midst of a kill, and as they see each other the season ends with us having to wait nine months to see what unfolds.<br /><br />As Dexter seasons go, I'd rate this the 3rd best, of 6.<br />3 out of 5 justifiable homicidesly end.

B0013D8LOK|3.0|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a 2007 film adaptation of the musical, directed by Tim Burton, staring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. And I just watched it. The film follows Sweeney Todd (Depp) as he goes on a vengeance fueled murder spree through old timey London. Mrs Lovett (Carter) helps the old boy out by making meat pies out of his victims. I thought it was OK but not great.<br /><br />I found maybe the thing I appreciated the least in this film was Tim Burton. Tim Burton has a signature look and style which bleeds into everything he touches. It's a little bit like Midas' golden touch, except when he touches things everything good and alive kind of melts away and falls off. Like the extremities of a leper. Tim Burton would probably love that analogy. He's probably the only professional goth. And I don't mean the only goth who has a career. He's probably the only person who has made a career out of wearing black and hanging out in dark rooms whining about things. I may be coming down on Tim Burton pretty hard, unfairly even, but I get really tired of him sometimes. This is one of those times.<br /><br />Sometimes it seems maybe Tim Burton is in a good mood when he makes a movie. You can tell because it has a color palate. Those films often come across as fantastical, and beautiful. He can convey moodiness without the need to suck the light out of scenes. Sweeney Todd is not one of those movies. With the exception of a couple notable scenes the movie is dark and dreary. I know this is what he was aiming for, but I feel he could have accomplished it with more than just the occasional splash of red. Schindler's List feels more colorful and full of life.<br /><br />If you can get past that, the movie starts to become a bit more enjoyable. If a movie like this can really be called \\"enjoyable\\". I like the musical numbers in this, in fact the music might be this movies strong suit. Which is really probably what you want from a musical. Depp apparently took singing lessons for this role, and while I wouldn't say he's any kind of virtuoso, his oft harsh delivery of song seems appropriate for the dark character.<br /><br />Dark is a pretty pervasive theme. This is a dark movie. Very dark. Todd starts on a mission of bloody vengeance, but it's not long before he's just killing people because he's plain crazy. Lovett's no saint either. She's really more akin to the devil on his shoulder. And also the angel. Every moral compass is crooked, except for maybe Toby Ragg the urchin boy, who ends the piece as our hero. Anyhow, Todd starts killing people just cause it's what he's into nowadays. This was really when the movie lost me. I was on board for a revenge story. Less so for people getting their throats cut just because Todd is mad at the world for the injustices he's faced and then baked into meat pies.<br /><br />About those meat pies. This is a small issue, but it still kind of stuck out for me. When we first meet Mrs Lovett there is literally a song and dance about how her meat pies are absolutely revolting. That's probably a lyric. Lot's of things rhyme with revoltin', especially in a cute brit accent. But once she starts stuffing flaky crusts with man meat, they are amazing and start flying off the shelves. I get that there is literally a secret ingredient, I just don't get how she knows how to make soylent green taste great when she couldn't make a passable product before taking a page from To Serve Man.<br /><br />I felt that the parts were well acted all around. Depp was expectantly good, even though I do tire of seeing him being pale and moody in Tim Burton movies. I really enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen in his small, but memorable, role. Every time I see him I think he's going to find a role that he really explodes in someday, as he always seems to disappear in whatever character he plays. Helena Bonham Carter fit perfectly into her role, as well. Oddly enough her reappearance in Burton movies doesn't irkme. Alan Rickman was of course great, but it is really Rickman doing Rickman. Nothing wrong with it, but he's not stretching. Hans Gruber is the Sheriff is the Metatron is Snape.<br /><br />One small aspect I found interesting is the blood. Oh yes, there is copious amounts of blood. The color of it intrigued me. It's so very red. It's theater blood. I have to assume this was a decision to give a nod to it's theater roots. Little things like that do a lot for me. Like how I suspect Todd knew Toby was behind him and made his throat an easy target. It's subtle, but it's there.<br /><br />I know it seems I've been pretty negative about the movie. I don't really mean to be. The movie is enjoyable, just not phenomenal.

Hans Gruber is the Sheriff is the Metatron is Snape.  One small aspect I found interesting is the blood. Oh yes, there is copious amounts of blood. The color of it intrigued me. It's so very red. It's theater blood. I have to assume this was a decision to give a nod to it's theater roots. Little things like that do a lot for me. Like how I suspect Todd knew Toby was behind him and made his throat an easy target. It's subtle, but it's there.  I know it seems I've been pretty negative about the movie. I don't really mean to be. The movie is enjoyable, just not phenomenal. There were some changes that I would have liked to see have been made which I would have preferred, but that's just me.

B005LAJ16I|4.0|Fear not, this review of the first season of Homeland is largely spoiler free.<br /><br />I'm always weary of new programs on TV. Not that I'm afraid I won't like it, stuff I think I won't like I hardly spare a thought for, usually it's the opposite. I watch a fair amount of TV, I generally don't want to add more to that list as I sometimes find myself hard pressed to keep up with the shows I've already put a considerable time commitment into. Recently I've allowed two new shows into that stonemasonesque inner circle, and Homeland was the standout of the two.<br /><br />I never saw AMC's Rubicon. It looked like it may have been interesting, but I heard bad things about it before I ever got into it, so I just let it go. Seems like it may have been one of AMC's rare misses. That said, the spy thriller genre seems rarely represented in television. Could be that in order to write a compelling espionage story is hard to do. Seems that way anyhow. Especially in a weekly serial format.<br /><br />Homeland pulled it off admirably. It was well written and well acted. I was continually left guessing as to what would happen next, trying to sort through clues and red herrings. I always had suspicions but never knew for sure what the truth of Brody was. I was always oscillating between thoughts of if he was innocent or a bomb waiting to go off. Literally.<br /><br />In some ways I have to say the show was hurt by it's marketing campaign building anticipation for the premier. If you never saw any of the promos they essentially boiled down to showing Claire Danes as the CIA agent and Damian Lewis as the soldier and told you that one of these people are a terrorist. That idea really intrigued me and I signed up for that theory, expecting to watch a show where we were presented with deliberately limited information as the viewer tries to determine who's the hero and who's the threat. Sounds interesting right?<br /><br />It would have been. Problem is that theory is only half true. It seemed pretty clear to me early on that Carrie [Danes] has some definite issues which may make her unstable and possibly delusional, but was no threat. That promise did hold fairly true to the Brody [Lewis] side of the equation however. You never really knew what to make of him. You knew something was up, you knew he was lying about some things, but you never really knew why. You were constantly being given clues and glimpses which would either hint to innocence or guilt. The inconsistencies of his actions could have been the actions of a terrorist covering his tracks, or just as easily a POW going through some serious stuff as he tries to assimilate back into a country and family which have grown strange and foreign to him after 8 years of imprisonment and torture.<br /><br />One other aspect that sat a little odd with me is the continuing nature of the show. Through the entire season it seemed to me that things were building to an explosive finale, one that would make it very difficult, if not outright impossible, to continue the show into further seasons. That concept intrigued and excited me. That this may have been more of a mini-series than a continuing show is something that you don't see often. In my water cooler talks of the show I consistently said that with the show progressing as it is, I can't see it being able to have a second season. Well, minor spoiler, I was wrong.<br /><br />Things didn't end quite as I'd expected. That's not to say at all it ended poorly. There were moments in the season finale that were some of the most tense moments I've seen in a long time. The suspense was incredible. Suspense may be the hardest thing to cultivate in a television show. Homeland provided it in spades.<br /><br />4 out of 5 surveillance vans.hat Carrie [Danes] has some definite issues which may make her unstable and possibly delusional, but was no threat.

B000WGZGNS|5.0|Beyonce!!!What else need to be said? Nothing else, She is phenomenal! Her performances are unbelievable. I already have this DVD, but want to watch it again. Instead of looking for it, i would rather just buy it again. The enjoyment is well worth the price of the DVD. Beyonce is now 30 and I am 40 and she is just Great! I want to be Beyonce!!!!! Not really, but if I was younger, she would give me something to aspire to be. The performances on this DVD displays her true raw talent! How did GOD bless one person with so much of everything!
B006JTS5OO|5.0|There is a wide spread misunderstanding on what a family film is. Most people don't know, and unfortunately it seems most movie studios don't know. A family film is not a kid movie. A kid movie is almost literally a poor man's family film.<br /><br />A kid movie only sets out to entertain children, and that doesn't take much. Bright colors and upbeat music is enough to make kids happy most times. As movies go, kid movies are a pretty safe bet. They're usually cheap, quick and easy to make and usually make money. Someone may be able to prove me wrong, but I don't think there is a such things as a good kid movie. Throw a rock at a movie marquee and you'll hit about three kid movies.<br /><br />A family film is a completely different animal. They are meant for the entire family, and not just trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. They supply things that the intelligent movie goer expect to find. Characters with depth and progression. A story with a beginning, middle and end. A mediocre family film will have moments come and go which are recognizable as peddling to certain demographics. A good family film will feel as if every moment is for everyone. The Muppets is such a movie.<br /><br />I expected to enjoy this movie. I did not expect to love it. Oh man, was this movie good. I don't really know how to start. Well, I guess the beginning is a good a place as any. There's a few things you could say The Muppets is about. It's a little bit of a coming of age story, a little bit of a movie about the relationship between brothers and a little bit about the relationship between a man and a woman. Or occasionally a frog and a pig.<br /><br />In the first case the movie is about Walter [Peter Linz (puppeteer and voice)], a newly introduced... well... Muppet, but that's not entirely correct in the mythology of this film, as Muppet refers solely to the performers of The Muppet Show, kind of like despite popular belief every Englishman is not in Monty Python. Here's what we'll do: muppet (small `m') will refer to the Henson created puppet, while Muppet (big `M') will refer to a member of The Muppets.<br /><br />Starting over. In the first case the movie is about Walter [Peter Linz (puppeteer and voice)], a newly introduced muppet who grew up watching The Muppet Show. Being the only muppet in his idyllic Real America small town, The Muppet Show gave him something to relate to. In that regard I suppose The Muppet Show is kind of like muppexploitation. As such Walter leaps at the chance to join his brother Gary [Jason Segel] and his girlfriend Mary [Amy Adams] on their big trip to LA. For Walter it is very much a pilgrimage to... Mupecca.<br /><br />The relationship between Walter and Gary (not a muppet, by the way) is charming. Also a little cutesy as the two seem to live in a bit of a state of arrested development. This is for three reasons, I'd say. Gary's devotion to his muppet brother, their existence in this town plucked straight from Leave it to Beaver and lastly because I think they're both kind of man-boys. Or occasionally muppet-boy. In that regard the movie is as much of a coming of age story for Gary as it is for Walter.<br /><br />Interestingly the relationship between Gary and Mary feels flatter than the one between Kermit and Miss Piggy. But that's more praise for the ability of the muppets to come across as real characters with real emotion than it is an indictment of the human performance. The human romance is given a sense of reality by the difficulty it's faced to overcome, but the muppet equivalent has very parallel themes while also being performed by hands in felt.<br /><br />The Muppets does just about everything right. The cameos are just good fun. The musical numbers are generally great, one or two of them struck me as falling just below the mark, but not enough to really take me out of it. The level of nostalgia felt just about right. It plucked the right heart strings without seeming like it was excludingthe younger crowd for who wouldn't understand the history. I really enjoyed Jack Black in this movie. That's the first time I've been able to say that for years. I was constantly impressed with how much character and emotion could be delivered from a puppet which so often you just don't get from computer animated characters. Hear that Lucas?<br /><br />There are very many places in this movie where it could have gone horribly wrong. I think the movie is protected by that it knows what it is and knows what it isn't. It has no problem poking a little fun at itself or light heartedly breaking the fourth wall. For example, the antagonist is a very stereotypical evil rich guy. But instead of playing it straight and being a glaring fault the film has fun with it. The dude's name is Mr Richman. He doesn't maniacally laugh. He says \\"Maniacal laugh.\\"<br /><br />The movie is also very aware, and in some cases about, that The Muppets have largely been out of the public eye for a long time and that people might not care about them. I don't know how much of that was an actual concern in the making of the movie, but it seems that people have responded by saying \\"Yes we do.\\"<br /><br />5 out of 5 hands in felt.Jack Black in this movie.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is my first ever review and is an attempt to counter some of the more negative reviews listed. This book is not in the league of Phillip Caputo's A Rumour of War nor is it as interesting as Carlos Hancock's exploits however, having said that, it was difficult to put down. If you really want to get a feel of how dangerous it was and the contribution snipers made in Iraq then you won't find a better account.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is the absolute best game that I have ever played in my entire life!! I love this game!!! thank you so much for creating this game!!!

B002ZG98FU|5.0|If there were ever a time to love Harrison Ford, it is through his performance in this movie. He's the HARD BOILED EGG of an anchorman with a soft golden yolk heart that he has kept under wraps for years; and it takes the frisky energy and boundless belief of McAdams to finally crack his hard shell and set this Lovable Curmudgeon free. Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton are the reasons that I purchased this DVD. I could watch this movie once a week, and still laugh out loud at their pairing and their exchange of barbed insults. Yes, McAdams is puppy-dog cute & frisky, her love interest is hunky; but it's the repartee, those mild insults both on and off camera that Ford and Keaton sweetly hurl at each other [\\"It's hard to get between you and a sausage...], that spice up this script. Accolades,as well, to superb Jeff Goldblum as the Big Man Upstairs, who carries himself with aplomb; in fact accolades to the Casting Director for each and every character placed in his or her role. The cast is empathetic, believable and lovable. It's Ford and Keaton who make this script fly! Note Ford's catharsis at the end of the film; his sudden realization that, \\"Yes,\\"  he can be a hard-core Anchor Man AND an approachable human at the same time. A great story line; great performances by the entire cast!

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I received the Fire as a gift and wasn't sure how I would take to these newfangled e-readers.  I thought a distinguised cover might soften the blow.  Indeed, it has.  Upon placing the Kindle Fire in the cover, I experienced the complaint I have seen in other reviews; that the top cover did not close entirely.  I simply placed the Kindle upside down so the weight of the Kindle itself 'trained' the cover.  After a few weeks of resting like this - problem solved.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there is so many games and you can play games to get games and the are like a full version game
B004VDL826|5.0|There already are plenty of reviews for the DVD of this title, but I shall just mention a few reactions to the film, then talk about the blu ray release.<br /><br />Solid State Society is a Ghost in the Shell motion picture.  Do not be fooled by the \\"Stand Alone Complex\\" subheading and think it is a few TV episodes or something.  This means top quality animation, a great music soundtrack, a complete story from start to finish and not much in the way of needing to see previous content to enjoy.  I should know, I've only seen the SAC first series and not 2nd GIG yet.  It also has a bit darker feel than the TV series, as to be expected from the films.  What is so impressive about the animation is (keep in mind I'm comparing this to previous GITS movies) the use of camera shaking, lens flares, and best of all tasteful use of 3D/CGI-type treatments.  Personally I think GITS 2.0 completely ruined the original first film, as the added 3D elements painfully stood out in comparison to the 2D shots, but that's another story.<br /><br />As for the blu ray, you get some extras but as I always watch with Japanese audio & English subs, I don't bother watching the English 'behind-the-scenes' extras.  I will say, however, that the Japanese TRAILER that is included is incredible.  So much better than the Bandai English trailer... I only wish there was a subtitle option for the Japanese trailer, but oh well.  There are no inserts of any kind, just the disc in the case.  The picture quality is brilliant; super-sharp, beautiful colors and of course looks great when colors are muted with the lovely washed-out tone that GITS commonly has.  Sorry I can't say much about the audio quality as I just use headphones and play it on a computer, but it sure sounded great to me.  Currently this movie is at a very affordable price, especially for anime on blu-ray so don't hesitate - Ghost in the Shell SAC - Solid State Society is worth it!

Splashtop makes it easy to connect to your computers from almost any mobile device via any WiFi or 3G connection. Setup is easy, and access is password-protected. Highly recommended. I use it to view my webcams remotely and the refresh rate over Wi-Fi is excellent.
0393320928|5.0|Those who read and enjoyed Feynman's other book, \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman,\\" will also enjoy this follow-up. The first half resembles the first book with funny, thoughtful and poignant essays about Feynman's relationship with his first wife and his further adventures as a noted physicist.  The second half is a significant change in tone as Feynman takes a sobering look at the Challenger space shuttle disaster and his role as a member of the special panel appointed by the government to investigate the causes. Overall a fantastic and fascinating read from the original World's Most Interesting Man.

B002WMIFY2|5.0|This was another great episode! It had such a meaningful message about caring for the feelings of those who are handi-\\"capable\\". It was especially sweet to see such a softer side of Sue for once, but for most of the episode her antics are there and as funny as usual. Mr. Shue had all of the Glee members use a wheel chair for 3 hours a day to see what Artie must go through 24/7. Also, I think Finn will be discovering about Puck fathering the baby within the next few episodes, I guess we will see what happens. Mrs. Shue wasn't on this episode, but Im waiting for her trifling butt to get caught up too!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun and keeps me busy. I would definately reccomend it. the only thing I don't like is having to unlock the games.
B002TUO2K8|5.0|So, I watched the pilot episode on Saturday, it is now Sunday evening and I am already on episode 9 just a day later. WOW, I feel like such a Gleek! LOL. I think I might even get my \\"too cool\\" boyfriend into this series. We LOVE Jane Lynch, and I am going to use her as bait to get him hooked! Each episode has made me laugh, and each one has shown talent! I have yet to be disappointed in Glee!
0553801473|3.0|To keep it short, if you're a fan of the Fire and Ice series you have to read this one just like you had to read Crows.<br /><br />GRRM hits all the familiar notes...unexpected betrayals, tar covered heads not being who they're supposed to be, etc.  He moves his characters around the gameboard, and kills off another main character or two that you'd been following since the early books.  By now you've learned not to make an emotional connection to any character, good guy or bad guy, because GRRM will kill them on a whim, and it holds true here as well.  Everything is building momentum toward the next book, but gives us neither any short-term resolutions nor the high drama of a cliffhanger to ponder while we wait for the next book. It's all perfectly fine, beautifully written, and clearly the same quality GRRM craftsmanship.  It's just all journey and no arrival.<br /><br />A lot more spoiler material can be found in earlier reviews, but all you need to know is that if you've read the earlier books of the series, you get all of what they offered and less.  If you're a fan, you're going to buy it and read it because you've invested 5000 pages worth of your life to get this far, but that's about it.  Again, the style and quality is the same as before.  I think the super negative reviews are pretty much a gauge of how deeply the fans of this series feel about \\"their\\" books and the sense of broken faith that comes with either main characters dying or being left hanging in the lurch at the end of this one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this honest story about death and the love that can grow from the pain. It was touching, believable, had a great plot and interesting twists. I really enjoyed the use of music and poetry, it helped tell the story in a way that regular dialogue wouldn't bring to the table. Don't hesitate to pick up this book if you're looking for a beautiful story about emotions and situations that are universal. Well done!

1451648537|4.0|Almost finished reading it, but my review will not change.  I have read several 1 star and 5 star ratings and have come to the conclusion that people wish that there was more insight into all of the technical aspects of how Jobs developed his techology and the brief chapters into the deals Job entered into.  I am not an Apple supporter now nor have I ever been.  But one thing I do understand and wanted to read about is Jobs was/is able to create a demand for a product that the consumer had no idea they wanted it.  That takes special talent.  Actually I believe Job's talent was around locating good, quality employees and not letting them go until they could not any longer provide a service for Apple.  Once their idea ran dry, he had no use for them.  I am not sure Steve could develop talent, but he could locate it.  Perhaps he could, the book just didn't describe it.    I am baffled at the number of people who wanted more information about the products and how he came up with the design and the mechanism for how they worked. I am glad this information wasn't in the book, actually it was.  But you had to read between the lines.  Jobs said several times he wanted to control all aspects of the consumers choice and what they could and couldn't do with Apple's products.  What control would he have if he let the cat out of the bag?  Running a company like he did isn't supposed to be easy and he shouldn't give away any details.  It is to his advantage to not allow this information out in the public light.  The book also indicated he patented tons of the various aspects of Apple designs.  He is clever and doesn't want anyone else to mimic Apple's products.  Good for him.    I had no idea though, as the book portrayed, Steve as an a** hole.  I imagine this is partly true, but you never get anywhere being the nice guy.  I am sure Gates is the same way.  This was the biggest surprise to me, just how open the book was about Job's being a douche as I am sure Steve read the book prior to its release.

0307719774|5.0|I loved the idea of this journal.  It gave me a place to get started, and to see how I've grown over the course of 5 years.  I started out with my own, and my husband liked the idea so much, he bought his own.  Now this is my go to gift!<br /><br />The book itself is attractive. It's smallish in size (about the length of your hand), the pages are beautifully done, and the paper is of good quality.  Unless you use permanent marker, you don't have to worry about \\"bleeding through\\".  It is the perfect size to keep on a nightstand or in your purse.  It's to pretty to toss around though.<br /><br />There is just enough space that you can write but aren't overwhelmed.  I say there is enough room to write about 2-3 sentences, if you write small.  The topic starters are a great blend of fun, day-to-day, serious, or thought-provoking. Some examples are: What was the last restaurant you ate at?  What is your mission?  Can people change?  What can you smell right now? etc.<br /><br />It's hard for me to remember to write every day, so if I get behind, I can go back and fill in what I've missed.  It's a lot of fun.  I recommend this for anyone who enjoys keeping a journal, but may not have much time or much motivation to do so.

B005EXA8LY|5.0|I first discovered Steven Wilson while reading Neil Peart's book \\"Ghostrider\\", where he mentions putting on some 'Porcupine Tree' on several of his motorcycle rides.  From the way Neil described the music I figured it had to be good so I just went out and bought PT's Fear of a Blank Planet, sounds unheard.    Luckily, not only was it good but it led to the discovery of perhaps my favorite artist of the past 10 years. Steven Wilson is simply a master of painting a picture with sound.  I loved Fear of a Blank Planet right away based on the sounds alone (and Gavin's drums didn't hurt), and admittedly although I found the vocals a bit 'eh', the music and sounds kept me in the game.   Since, I have come to enjoy Wilson's vocals very much.  They are subdued and subtle and fit the overall tapestry of sound to perfection. His voice is simply another of the instruments, as opposed to being the main focus screaming to 'look at me!'.   Grace for Drowning is the first SW solo album I own, so I can't compare it to his other solo work. I'm not dying to rush out and get his other stuff because there is no way he has released anything better than this. (although I eventually will get all of it)  Here's why it's so good:  1) First listen is mellow and easily digestible for such an ambitious work. You just know it isn't going to take 'work' to get into this disc, like most prog  (sorry Steve!) or lengthy projects such as this. The sounds are so pleasing right away, it's easy.   2) Subsequent listens, you start to really appreciate the depth of what this album has to offer.  There are just layers on top of layers of well placed sounds and and interesting instrumentation.  As you start to 'know' the music, you just want to listen to the whole thing non-stop. You can't really just listen to one song.   3) When you finally know both discs top to bottom, you realize how great this is. There is simply not one second of 'can't wait to get to that next part', like on most albums like this, or like in many forms of music for that matter. You just enjoy every moment.  In fact I just listened to the first disc and absolutely have to stop writing to go pop in disc 2, right now!  4) Ahhhh....all better, disc 2 is now playing.  Bliss.......what else do you need to know?  just buy it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|accurate and helpful. if only I had wifi at work so I could use it there too! I like the hourly forecast option.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app works great! The brights LED light is amazing when you use it, and the colored lights work just as well! It worked great for me.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It works really nicely on lg esteem, virtually no lag. I am impressed since I figured it would be. 5 stars.
B003FNLZ62|3.0|Well I gave it 3 stars out of 5 because it was a boring bookI could barely pay attention at all. The only reason I did give it 3 stars instead of 1 was because the main character is easy to relate to for many people including myself. I would'nt advise reading it however if you have a report and just want to read something short. This book is very hard to read unless you like depressing things that make you want to go kill youself.
0788859544|5.0|Received the dvd in good condition, just as it was advertised. Received it in Alaska rather quickly. Overall, very satisfied.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|program works great. no problems at all. occasionally when im connected to my pc it will disconnect but i can just reconnect right away. not sure if it was a problem with my home network or the program. either way A+.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|The box this set comes in is great.  All disk there and nothing broken.  This is a great series.  I would recommend this show to all ages.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great time waster a lot of fun I could spend tons.of.time playing this if you like simple short games you should try this game out
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. It is a great time passer, the best part is unlocking the minigames. great for road trips or even trips to your friends house.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great way to access my computer without actually being there. Very useful if you work at home. I can watch videos and movies from my computer while.in bed.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good. tons of.fun. I think the creators did a wonderful job at making this game fun for the whole family
B005K17RU0|5.0|This works great on my Kindle Fire. The map feature is awesome - showing all the storms around us. Had no trouble installing or using it.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Not Natalie Portman's best role, but not her worst, either. Best super hero movie in the world? Maybe not, but it's a witty, action-packed movie the whole family can enjoy. Unlike a lot of movies rated PG-13, after viewing it, I felt it was safe enough to let my 7 year old watch with the family. Not a lot of harsh language, fighting but no spurting blood, etc. No sex other than a 15 seconds of a shirtless Thor and a kiss towards the end. Nothing risque in terms of sexual innuendo, drugs, etc. Not even grown up jokes found in some children's movies which go over the kiddies' heads.   Although I've described this movie as mild in terms of adult content, it's not a bore. I'm reviewing this as someone unfamiliar with the series, etc. So, with no back ground other than who Thor was in mythology, I didn't find the movie too predictable. Some movies are great, but you're not likely to want to see them again anytime soon. This is one of those rare instances in which a movie is actually worth having on DVD or Blu-ray.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I loved this app because it kept my notes updated everywhere... my kindle fire, Pc, and my cellphone. but recently it kept deleting all my notes! I had to continuosly recreate all I could remember until I just gave up and uninstalled it, happened about 5 times.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun game to play because you can play it any were any time. I love playing it somuch because it is so much fun.

B003Y5H5EW|5.0|cant wait to see it and ill own it as well .It will be a plus to the collection seeing i have the rest all ready.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I love this CD.  Scotty has an amazing voice, and I listen to it all the time in the car.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a great basic solitaire game. Easy interface. Very configurable. I highly recommend this app to anyone that likes to play cards.
B005D0RDKW|4.0|This is a really solid title and I would highly recommend it for any Rush fan's library.  These guys are just so musically talented it is pure pleasure watching them perfom.  I missed a chance to actually catch this show live, so it was a no brainer for me to at least buy the disc.  I will agree, however, with some of the other reviews that the sound quality does not blow me away - hence the reason I only gave it 4 stars.  The band and the overall concert is a 5 star performance all the way.    I'm no audio expert, but in my opinion the Snakes & Arrows blu-ray has a much better mix and overall sound quality.  That being said, the content is great and well worth the purchase.
0887307280|5.0|E-myth by Michael Gerber is one of the best business books I have ever read.  He not only guides you through the processes and procedures that every business owner should implement; he allows the women-preneur to stretch her mind to see the big picture of her business.  I believe his reasoning why most small businesses don't make it in today's economy is because they don't see the BIG PICTURE! It's important to surround yourself as a leader working ON the business not IN it.  Wonderful read, I tell all of my coaching clients to purchase this book if they have employees.[[ASIN:0061733822 The E-Myth Enterprise: How to Turn a Great Idea into a Thriving Business]]
B003UESJH4|5.0|Few of us have memories long enough to extend back to the time just prior to WWII.  This was certainly one of the \\"defining moments\\" for the British, as they moved toward the great confrontation with German Nazism.  How does one capture a bit of that time?  This movie does it by framing a simple historical relic, a short segment of a German propaganda film featuring Hitler.<br />There are beautiful metaphors in this film that establish the framework, centered around a person, soon to be king, who must find his voice, just as all the British must do soon, to face a monstrous horror that has grown and like a malignancy is about to intrude on their lives.  The acting is splendid.  I especially liked the portrayal of Winston Churchill.  This is really a \\"must see\\" film for anyone interested in how humans can find courage before the monsters of history.
1451627289|5.0|I love Stephen King; he has been amongst my all-time favourite authors since I was ten. What I most love about him are his chilling horror stories that make me crouch and watch behind my back. However, I still admire 11/22/63, which is rather a suspense novel(like Dolores Claiborne, Misery, or Carrie). King has never let down a reader - if I could, I would rate this book six stars. I loved George by the way. Most of King's protagonists are fun. King, again, proved that he was not only a brilliant horror writer (in my opinion, the best one; he was probably better than H. P. Lovecraft), but he was great when it comes to character drawing, creating a gloomy, touching, or suspenseful atmosphere, or writing a hell of a plot. Six stars rate here. I highly recommend 11/22/63 for every book lover. For King fans, it is a must-read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good interface and lots of playing options.  I enjoy playing a few games of solitaire to pass the time and this app certainly fits the bill.  If you like solitaire, I recommend this free app.  You get a little ad between games, but one click and you're off and running.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|The best of the NL series  An annual holiday must !  Chevy Chase is much under rated   One of my top ten comedies of all time
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I have an Asus Transformer tablet and this works perfectly with it.  All kinds of great, accurate information.  I use it as my Live wallpaper and the moon rotates with the screen. I love it!  I am so glad I gave it a try.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|crashes a lot! really irritating! fun game except when it crashes! fix it please! almost worth it being free but...
1417709049|5.0|If you're looking for an atypical mystery thriller, look no further! This book is a wonderful read. It jumps back and forth and all around. I would suggest springing for the full color version, though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First post apocalyptic book I've ever read and I am extremely surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book to anyoneno matter what genre you prefer, it's sure to accomidate everyone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids love playing these games they are 8 and 3.  The only thing I don't like, some games are a little slow to react.  Overall good app!
B005HSL626|5.0|this is the greatest game ever... i love it i play it every day and I'm a master at it(: its amazing
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is basically a time-travel, science fiction novel that does remind me of Replay (Grimwood). There are some \\"hints of horror\\" and one can imagine various darker threads at times, though that's all they are: hints.  But the novel works as a thriller as well, an exciting race against time. It brought back many memories of that date to me (I was 21) and I still remember the pompous smirks on the police as they led Oswald to slaughter at the hands of Jack Ruby. Was it one man or a conspiracy? Was Oswald the fall guy? The book doesn't answer those questions; after all it IS fiction, but a recent mob expose said La Cosa Nostra was involved. Who knows?  Several typos: Killeen, Texas, is repeatedly misspelled Kileen.  An excellent, quick read and a wonderful love story as well. I hope you're back, Mr. King, but without the \\"pharmaceutical aids\\" you used to use!
B005J4TLN4|5.0|This movie is very british, heavy accents and south London slang. They use the F-word an aweful lot in the usual British way. Fun movie, lots of intense action, drama, humor and space alien violence. Needs to be watched many times to understand all the dialoge but I don't mind.
B0055SWM08|5.0|only problem with this game is that it is a bit addictive!  give it a try and see for yourself its only 99 cents.
B0063IH60K|5.0|colorful quick and fun. what else do you need in a game? this is easy to use and it's free
B004HO6I2E|3.0|Yet another body-swap Freaky Friday rip-off. I'm never a big fan of R-rated comedies because of the gross-out humor that is way too trendy today. That's great for 11-year olds but this is supposed to be for adults. And this movie starts out with gross humor right out of the gate and flirts with during the first 3/4 of the movie. But the whole movie is redeemed by the last half-hour or so. There is a good message delivered and the actors pull it off very well. I almost shut the movie off several times but toughed it out and enjoyed the last half.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this program.  Have it on my phone, computer &amp; new Kindle.  It is amazing for lists,  clipping websites, and tons of other things I need to remember . And my spouse can view my lists too!
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|OK, I admit, I was a huge Captain American fan as a kid, read the comic book, and was a fan. So when I heard this movie was coming out I was really looking forward to it. And I was not disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although seeing Elrond as a bad guy was kind of hard to take. Glad he pulled out the red make-up so I would quit thinking about Elrond. But seriously, the movie is definitely worth watching if you like the super-hero genre. Because Cap is not really a super-hero with special powers except for exceptional strength and endurance as a result of a \\"super soldier\\" experiment. The costume is toned down so that it looks like a cross between a super-hero costume and regular soldier's uniform. I was just a bit disappointed in the ending which I will not reveal, but it sets up a sequel, I suppose.
0439023513|3.0|How much did I enjoy Hunger Games? I just finished reading all three for the second time recently. That doesn't change how much I disliked this final book. I give it 3 stars as the series earned it. The violence is bad, the games are bad, message I got in the first book and it was rinse and repeat in the second. I didn't mind. In this one, it's too much. I wish it could have been just the next story of Katniss and Peeta. I would have preferred a love story ending to this and don't even like romance books. Katniss will never be the same. We knew it and didn't need the epilogue.
031603441X|5.0|Very happy with this book and the transaction fast shipment! Happy to purchase from you, I received it in pleanty of time for Christmas.
0439023491|5.0|Just finished Stanek's Magic Lands post-apocalypse novels and dived back into The Hunger Games books for another read. I've always thought Collins first book was pretty good but it was the sequel, this book, that made me love it. It's even better as we already know Peeta and Katniss. The book starts with Katniss as the face of a rebellion against the capital. Katniss gets caught up in the President's revenge plots against her. One picky thing is the ending. I liked it but it only made me want to read the third one even more.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This game has the best of both worlds combinding investigation with find the hidden objects games. With a good story line and great graphics I recommend this fun inventive game!
0439023521|4.0|Couldn't resist reading this again recently after finishing Stanek's Complete Magic Lands post-apocalypse dystopia novels. Who can resist books about the fight for survival in a grim world. Hunger Games starts with Katniss in her district and slowly the idea of the games are introduced. A twist comes when little Prim is picked. Katniss expected she would be picked since she has so many more lottery tickets. There's an episode of Sliders called \\"The Lottery\\" that this remind me of.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|the games are hard to play... and they don't have instructions. :( not cool!... I just spent 20 minutes on.this stupid game
0060936223|5.0|for anyone who has ever been an artist or had artistic aspirations, this history of a friendship is inspiring. Also, the history of this particular time in the NYC arts scene is illuminating.
B000X107GI|5.0|Super Fast delivery, great prices and batteries are great for my application. Would highly reccommend. Will be using again real soon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|like the challenge to see what task and game comes next. no problem with the challenge of having to finish 10 games first.
0802130208|1.0|This book is the humor and intellectual equivalent of Jersey Shore. It's nothing but horrible people doing horrible things. Being somewhat OCD, I have difficulty not finishing a book once started. However, the only reaction this book created was hatred for the main character. I couldn't continue to slog through; try as I might.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is my favorite office app, it isn't perfect and still has room for improvement but in my opinion the best. I've tried quick office and documents to go.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great for passing the time. get thiss app and you will have lots of fun. the games are fun, and you will have fun getting more games!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its def not what I was looking for .the games aren't that good . some of them are just stupid and too difficult to figure out.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The book is really good. I agree with some of the reviewers on here who think it took awhile to get to the point sometimes, but it didn't stop me from enjoying what is overall a very good story. This probably wouldn't have been the final draft if Larsson hadn't died...my thought is the editor and publisher would have had him do a re-write to refine it a little. Even so it was a great read and I look forward to the next two books in the series. Lisbeth's character is very intriguing and made me want to learn more. Definitely read before you see the movie. It will greatly aid your understanding of the plot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app because its fun and funny.  its like a arcade to me.101 games is loveaboul to me
B003H9M1QM|5.0|This product came fast and in great condition. It comes with the dvd and blu-ray on two different discs, so it is good for visiting people that only have dvd players or giving one away. The kids love the movie, so no complaints here.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for mindless boredom :p<br />you have to play some games to open or unlock other games, as well.<br /><br />Some of the games aren't quiet right but do work for the kindle fire.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|This could have been a great piece of work if the production company would have spent the extra money to use film instead of video tape.  The quality is slightly above  that on YouTube.  The performance is outstanding.  David Gilmore's guitar work is outstanding and you can tell they really loved performing.  God bless Rick Wright. RIP
B000000OQF|5.0|I got this for Christmas this year after losing my original copy years ago.  I was thrilled.  Man I miss the REAL GNR!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|A fun and engaging game. You shouldn't get bored. Has enough variety for hours of fun for all ages. I am very satisfied with this game and would recommend it.

B00004Z4SD|4.0|Simple, sweet and elegant, this wise movie is made all the more poignant by the fact that it is true. \\"The Straight Story\\" is a celebration of family and the bonds that endure.

B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Mr.Clapton, If you ever read any of this junk, which I doubt that you do, don't pay any attention to the yay-hoos that want to keep you locked into the style of music they think you should be playing. Just sing a few bars of Ricky Nelson's old song and you and the cats keep doing your thing. I can dig where you were comming from on this one.
B004E547D8|5.0|Very happy with this movie I have not yet opened it but I love the movie so I am sure that this one will be great!
1594202842|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed the book! I am in my early twenties of Hispanic decent (Mexican-American) and right away found so many similarities between how Chua describes how Chinese parents raise their children and how I was raised. My parents found it amusing how Amy's daughters weren't allowed certain things that Western parents seem to encourage their own children to do, such as sleepovers and playdates (my mother laughed at this and was in agreement that this is really unheard of outside of the U.S. and what benefit does this provide to children? None, whatsoever.)  My parents were not however as strict as the author describes herself through different episodes in her book, they did value high grades and allowed myself to make quite many of my decisions (such as allowing me to quite taking saxophone lessons after about a year, for which I still regret to now and have told them that at age 11 I was not in any position to make a decision of my own and now wish they would have forced me to continue with the instrument).  Much criticism is out in the media about how this book focuses on a type of parenting that should definitely not be used for today's children, and that is exactly not what the book is trying to convey. The book is about a mother understanding her own demanding values for her daughters and of them trying to find themselves throughout to where it works out in the end. I do believe that for those that criticize the book are the ones that have not read it entirely or seem to read incomplete excerpts.   There are quite many gripping descriptions in the book about confrontation between using a parenting system that has been used for so long and trying to implement this in a lax environment, where straying away from the norm is seen as an attack on good ol' American values which are definitely not what they used to be. There were also comical moments in the book about typical everyday battles between parents and children that for me brought back many happy memories.   Overall a great read!
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I bought the DVD at Wal Mart without really having any expectations. To be honest, I only bought it because it was cheap ha ha ha and I love watching concert DVD's. I watched the DVD and I was blown away! Her All Girl band is off the chain, Beyonce's voice is out of this world and her dancing is straight up outrageous and unreal. Oh, but what's even more impressive is that she was 5 months PREGNANT!! I have a new found love for Beyonce! My only complaint would be the super cheesey script she had at the beginning of the DVD but other than that it was excellent.   Best Performances in my opinion:  1. Love On Top  2. End Of time  3. Who run the world  4. I care  5. Crazy in love
B00006FMAW|4.0|Wow wth was this? lol I just finished watching this on Youtube and I was beyond disgusted but at the same time very intrigued and really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.   There weren't many good guys in the movie but the ones who turned out to be good guys shocked me in all honesty.Disgusting gross hilarious and freaky.This movie is what you would call... an EXPERIENCE yeahhh Ill just put it like that.This is one of those movies thats very hard to describe but if you are interested in an insane society groteseque gory and disgusting imagery then this movie is right up your alley.

B004O3YGMC|3.0|people the app is awesome. it was easy to setup even for me, a person that was forced into the world of electronics by my son. I have it on my phone and my kindle. my only complaint is the audio. it is horrible. I hope when the updates come this little glitches will be fixed. so until then I will watch movies that I pretty much know what is being said

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Overall, this app was great. Then one morning, I go to disable it and my password stops letting me in to my Fire, and the music is still playing! Ultimately, I had to do numerous shutdowns until I could access my appsand delete it(sniff, sniff). But this was only my expirence. Read the other reviews and get this cool app.
B003ES61EE|1.0|I own the Nikon Lens Pen and I tried to save a few bucks and buy the Amazon one for my camera bag.  One day, I reached in my camera bag and all this black powder was all over the inside of my bag.  The amazon lens pen is a cheap generic.  The cap did not stay on and the tip part came off the pen also.  Both tips with the black powder'ed tips was bouncing around.  I'll stick with Nikon sport optics next time.
B005GVF95O|5.0|I have been looking for a fun app for my 16 month old daugther and THIS...IS...IT!!!  She LOVES that she can move the peices on the screen, what a great mommy and daugther game.  She feels involved in what I am doing on my cool toy (kindle fire) and I enjoy watching her laugh and learn new shapes and colors.  At the end of each puzzle there is applause which she finds hilarious.  Great find!
0240815807|4.0|This book covers nearly all of what one needs to know about mixing in the small studio. It presents clear and in-depth explanations of the entire process. The author even suggests free plug-ins for most of the tasks he describes. Just by understanding and following the techniques in the book, my mixes have already improved dramatically - all without spending a single cent on new equipment or software.<br /><br />It was quite easy to read, but yet didn't skimp on the technical information.<br /><br />You also get the added enjoyment of reading a smattering British slang, if that tickles your fancy, as it does mine.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|My Mom and I always watched this show when it came on tv, the show reminded us of US! I thought it would be a perfect Christmas gift and it was. We have already re-started our Gilmore Girls watching times. I would recommend the show to everyone but especially to Moms and Daughters for that special...eat chocolate, ice cream, cookies and watch \\"OUR SHOW\\" times.  You will want to get all the seasons!
B005KJZDXK|4.0|A Very She & Him Christmas succeeds as both a new She & Him album and as a holiday music album. I like to build a solid Christmas playlist with classics as well as non-traditional material and this fits in well.

B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Lots of data, not just moon phases, included in this program.  Nice looking graphics and the cheese option is amusing.  It's a handy app, but I'm not sure it's worth 99¢.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you can play lots of games it is ok should add some more arcade games good for wasting time in waiting areas
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son for Christmas. He thought is was the greatest gift ever!Everything worked good, easy to program.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like how tu gain the other games almost like achievements. However the ads do get a little annoying, but the app is free so I can ignore that for now. works great on kindle fire, no problems there. All around a good pack of mini games.
B00000DHRX|4.0|I enjoy his singing voice,it has a nice quality. My era was Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis, Nat King Cole,etc. George has that sexy sultry sound when he sings certain songs. Other songs are romantic or poignant sentiment. His songs can put you in a certain mood if you like. The value of the two cd set was very good. I am pleased with the purchase.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I think I'm missing something, but if I am, then that's okay with me. I did not see the flaws in the blu ray transfer that so many are mentioning. Perfectly happy and satisfied with the quality of this blu ray. Crisp and clear on my 42\\" Panny plasma. If you love a wonderful musical, and want to see it on blu ray, then don't hesitate to buy this version. If an improved version comes along, then I'll go for it as well. But for now, I've seen a most enjoyable, and satisfying movie. Happy for my purchase. :)

1846144841|5.0|I'm not a big reader of newspapers or watcher of the news, mostly as the news these days is reported as quickly as possible with the barest of facts and for larger issues like the economic troubles of recent years, almost no understanding of the circumstances for context. That's not to say I'm not interested, but I would only be interested in reading about the financial woes of late through a writer who could write, not as an economic or academic, but a true writer, and could make the subject come alive and seem comprehensible - enter Michael Lewis.<br /><br />Lewis is a writer I've never heard of before and was surprised to see the recent films \\"The Blind Side\\" and \\"Moneyball\\" were based on books he'd written. Amazon recommended him, I gave him a shot and I am very glad I did - \\"Boomerang\\" is a tremendously interesting read.<br /><br />It collects five essays Lewis wrote focusing on five specific areas of the world: Iceland, Greece, Ireland, Germany, and California. Iceland is a fascinating case as Lewis explains how a country with a population of 300,000 went from fishing to banking within a generation thanks to fishing quotas and over-education. He also goes on to describe the society and something of the country's history, going back decades, to explain how they came to their current situation.<br /><br />Greece's case is incredible. A nation of tax cheats, overpaying themselves and mortgaging their futures through avoidance of fiscal and public responsibility - the essay is startling and shocking, I was shaking my head in disbelief as I read it. The Vespaidi Monastery is the aspect that ties it together into a compelling narrative: a couple of monks with an old land deed went on to build a real estate empire - but remained monks. And yet despite the way that it seems nearly everyone in Greece is responsible for their own mess, they took to the streets to riot.<br /><br />Ireland and Germany are both interesting essays too, but Lewis' California essay where he describes the way that the public services pensions are bringing the state to its knees is also mind-bending. The case of Vallejo is both tragic and seemingly a real-life John Steinbeck novel. Lewis also includes an interview with Arnold Schwartznegger where the Governator comes across as a fairly intelligent, well-meaning guy who did his best to fix the faulty system but failed due to the inability of the public to think beyond the short-term.<br /><br />\\"Boomerang\\" contains far more than I've mentioned and these brief summaries don't do justice to the masterful way Lewis writes and is able to explain complex situations both clearly, concisely, memorably, and compellingly. Halfway through the book I ordered his last book \\"The Big Short\\" and all I can say is that anyone curious about the aftermath of the financial crisis and is looking for someone to explain it well, would do well to pick up this book. And it isn't all doom and gloom, Lewis ends the book on an optimistic note citing the case of the current Fire Chief of Vallejo, Paige Meyer - want to know his story? Pick up this book, it's an amazing read.vices pensions are bringing the state to its knees is also mind-bending. The case of Vallejo is both tragic and seemingly a real-life John Steinbeck novel.

0307891402|5.0|After buying this guide and spending a week with it I feel compelled to write my first ever review for a product. I have never before seen a video game guide so beautiful and comprehensive. When I saw it at the store I was skeptical about shelling out even more money for a book when the internet is such a reliable source when you're stuck or looking for the minutia that completionists (like myself) adore. I could not be happier that I gave in and purchased it.<br />  To start with, I have to describe the peerless physical quality of this tome. I tear through guides when I do decide to get them and they often fall apart at the binding, lose pages, and become dog-eared from constant referencing. This book will never fall into that rut. Staggering at nearly 700 pages, it is hard-bound in an exquisitely beautiful cover that can stand with pride on any bookshelf, next to any hardcover book, or as the centerpiece of any coffee table. The artwork and quality draw the eye and entice gamers and non-gamers alike to pick it up and start flipping through it. When I brought it home, my non-gamer wife and three oldest children all wanted to take turns looking through it before they even knew what it was. My wife read it for over fifteen minutes and she has no interest in the game whatsoever! The book is as impressive and sturdy as any college textbook I've ever owned (if not more so) and is also made with a light-weight paper that makes it deceptively light to carry (although with such a high page count, it's still not something you'll read much with one hand). The icing on this already delicious cake is something I have absolutely never encountered or expected in a strategy guide - not one, but two ribbon bookmarks attached into the binding (similar to those in large Bibles). I have made extensive use of these and the convenience and life they add to the book is hard to appropriately measure. I cannot heap enough praise on this guide for quality alone and I guaranty you have never seen a video game book of its like.<br />  Within, the guide maintains the high level quality throughout. The layout is user-friendly and nearly all-inclusive of the massive amount of variety this game offers. The sections are clear and concise and, far from having glaring omissions, are as complete as could be hoped for. One fears that certain items of low importance (the statistics on buckets or dinnerware, for instance) will be overlooked in order to focus on \\"more important\\" areas - but for naught! Even these details are meticulously charted in sections all their own. The tables, quest walkthroughs, maps, strategies, lore - it is all here and more. The only complaint I can manage to direct goes to Prima's editing staff - the book is riddled with typos. This is an extremely small issue as they absolutely never interfere with page references, never ruin or make unusable any information, and in light of the millions of words and figures herein, are so easy to overlook that I doubt most readers will even notice. I have also NEVER read a strategy guide that did not have this flaw, and as such is more a criticism of the process of bringing these guides to press than a criticism of this particular guide. (I am also particularly attentive to this sort of detail as an English Major with an OCD-like compulsion to comb every chart and table I read.)<br />  I recommend this guide with more confidence than I have ever recommended a product before. If you are serious about the game, this guide (and the included access to the online map site) is a near essential purchase. If you are serious about strategy guides or consider yourself a connoisseur of video game books in general, I would recommend this to you even if you don't own the game - it is very seriously that impressive! You will not be disappointed.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This season arrived in very good condition. My mother loved recieving it as a gift very much. I would buy from this person again.

0545091020|5.0|This review is of the audio CD edition of the book.  There are thousands of reviews of the book itself so I will focus this review only on the audiobook and narration.<br /><br />The narrator of this book is Carolyn McCormick.  She reads at an easy pace that is neither too fast nor too slow.  Her diction is precise, almost crisp, and her voice is pitched a tiny bit lower than many female narrators. Altogether, it is an enjoyable narration.<br /><br />At first I thought her voice was too \\"old\\" for Katniss; the lower pitch of her voice sounds more adult than teenager.  But I soon got past worrying about whether she sounded like Katniss, especially with all the other characters in the book.  She doesn't do a lot of different voices for the various characters, except when the characters themselves are themselves distinctive in the way they speak, such as Haymitch, Effie & Templeton.<br /><br />The CDs don't have a verbal notification that the CD has ended, so you only notice it is done when there is a long pause that you realize isn't going on to the next chapter.  The track lengths are pretty good -- generally in the 4-5 minute range -- so if you get distracted and have to repeat a track, you don't have to go back too far.<br /><br />I've also read the book and although I prefer visually reading to audiobooks, this is a very enjoyable way to \\"read\\" this book.  Because of the narrator's pace, teachers could use this narration in conjunction with the physical book to help a struggling reader follow along with the text.<br /><br />I will look for more audiobooks narrated by Ms. McCormick; her narration is very easy on the ears.
0385535139|1.0|I've read every book he's written so far except the children's book. The first book is still the best and the Litigator has hit the bottom of the trough. Boring. I'll wait for the $0.99 version from now on. Guess the dude got rich and doesn't care anymore.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fair play integrity.. plays consistent and provides a challenge. To the average person. it can be very challenging and is well.worth the time.
B0063IH60K|2.0|good game but keeps taking me to online video with pop ups very annoying, every other move. between games ads were fine but taking me online is not
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|after years of embarrassing party fouls finally an app that's perfect for letting me know when to stay out of the public eye.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I am very pleased with this game it is super fun and easy enough yet challenging enough for everyone from my 5 yr old to the genius that I am (that's a joke).  After being disappointed by lame games such as Sorry Sliders, Trapdoor Checkers and Mousetrap, it is easy to be wary of lame games where it seems that the makers sat around drunk and made up the rules.  Even I Spy Eagle Eye was sort of a let down, it could've been SO much better if they just hadn't cheaped out on the number of cards included in the game.  Blokus is a sure fire win, it's sort of like Tetris and Dominoes combined, pretty cool.
0691152640|5.0|Right now when the world is in the midst of a great recession and the combined U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have diverted what would probably have been a depression, their can be no better education than what this book offers us.  A history, time-line and handbook of past crisis.  It puts in perspective what financial crisis are, how frequent they occur, whether banking, currency or just simply a market bubble (1987 Black Monday and Internet Bubble were not and did not lead to financial crisis).  Knowing that they occur in developed and emerging (make that emerged) makes us all feel somewhat normal and it informs us that they're really not \\"Black Swans\\" which is so overused these days.  They're normal financial dislocations.  The really use of this book however is to teach us what worked in terms of allocating resources to remedy the problem.  What history teaches us and this book's records document is that government spending deficits and government debt-to-GDP do matter.  You cannot spend your way nor devalue your currency into prosperity. They produce (only sometimes) short term gains but the long term price for those gains is much more painful and destructive in the long term.  Bernanke in particular is essentially continuing the policies of Greenspan, keeping rates way too low for too long and priting money, both encouraging currency devaluation, asset bubbles and false confidence.  It would be a big help if he would read this book and gain a longer perspective about the historical ramifications of his and Obama's policies.  This book is a must-read for any beginning economist and also for anyone who someday might find themselves in charge of govt spending.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love Bible App I read my favotite scriptures and when I go to church I take notes from the sermon.I love how the have all the scriptures easy to find.I would recommend this app to anyone who's into the Bible:)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|don't have anything to compare it to. But it. has been a good tool for taking notes in preparation of evangelism.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|The special features on the disk are nice, but it is the extended cut version that makes this version stand out from its genre peers, and a far superior work than what was released in theaters. For purists, the Theatrical Release is also embedded in the disk, along with online connection stuff and other gee-whiz content. Now, as for the story itself... OK- so it's not 'Batman Begins' or 'The Dark Knight'. It is, in my opinion, on a par with 'Iron Man', 'Spider-Man' and literally light years ahead of the vast majority of the other superhero flicks, or any year's Grand Action Summer Blockbuster, for that matter.  While it lacks the respectful humor, epic grandeur and sheer joy of 'Superman- the Movie', or the delightful heart of 'Harry Potter', for an origin film (almost always problematic) introducing an implausible character to translate to live action (let alone suspend disbelief), I think it's a \\"heroic\\" good start. I give Ryan Reynolds kudos for taking on the project. He certainly looks like the spitting image of Neal Adams' early 70s renderings of Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, and he's a faaaaaaaaaaaar better performer than (insert lead male actor, action film, here:__________). The production values are phenomenal, and the imagery gorgeous, ESPECIALLY in the Blu-ray format. Still, the movie lacks... feeling? The restored footage greatly adds a sense of human weight to the storyline, however, and helped this viewer's cohorts to connect with what has always been an emotionally difficult character to connect with. The rushed, anti-climactic ending (although exceedingly magnificent visually) seemed like a misstep, but I can't imagine how I would have written it differently, so I can't quibble too much about this point. At any rate, the source material is there for this motion picture to grow into a long-lived franchise IF the producers can find that elusive combination of soul, action and drama. I wonder if J.K. Rowling and Richard Donner would be interested in teamingup for the third installment? ;~J
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I have had a couple misfires over the years ordering movies online because you just never know, as the saying goes, but my DVD arrived early and in great condition - I would buy from these guys again:)
0684857219|5.0|This book, despite it's age, still has gems of wisdom and knowledge pertaining to building muscle.
0439813786|5.0|My book arrived early and in pristine condition - the early part is especially impressive as it was during teh peak of the holiday shopping season!
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I played this one probably 12 hours a day every day for the first two weeks I had it. That \\"The King Is Dead\\" made #1 on the Billboard charts really makes me feel good about America.  The Decemberists' music has to be taken for what it is, in my opinion. It's not to everyone's taste, and those of us who love the band probably still favor some songs and albums over others, but I think anybody who wanted to could find something of beauty here. Like the vocal harmonies on \\"June Hymn\\" -- on a bad day, listening that track, even just the 28 seconds from about 2:12 to 2:40, is enough for me to feel that things can never be entirely awful in a world where those voices exist.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|You'll understand why the series ends the way it did, but that won't make you feel any better. I won't put any spoilers in my review, however, I'll say this was the only book in the series I had to FORCE myself to finish. I didn't find myself quickly flipping through the pages because I was entangled in the plot. No. This time I flipped through at such a fast rate to get the miserable story to it's conclusion.   The ending. While, I did somewhat get the outcome I'd hoped for, the circumstances of how the characters got to said point are so over-the-top, matter-of-fact, but almost unexplained that you can't help but feel a bit swindled + empty afterwards. It's like the author knew she cheated her readers so she threw together a weak last chapter + epilogue to soothe our expected disapproval. Like she got tired of her own series, realized she killed off too many great characters for questionable reasons + needed to make it up to us + herself, somehow.  I do, however, understand why it ended this way. Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, etc. all went through such terrible things + war really DOES change people. And great people (or characters) are often times casualties of war at the expense of others' \\"master plans.\\" I get that. Still, this is a book, + I feel like we + the characters were entitled to a better, more fulfilling ending after this long, destructive journey we've been on together.   But, maybe the author did get the ending SHE wanted since we all feel so strongly about how things turned out. Not everything ends like the movies + Panem was no fairy tale land. However, I hope the film version of this particular book is different + feels like a more appropriate end to the story. I hope.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun and free games all in one app. I might not get it if it wasn't free though.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|wow!  this Moon Phase Pro is AWESOME!!  it's great Education to my 3 kids.. it's must have it on your phone!!   if kids want to see real moon... then this is for you!    t mobile G2
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of games to choose from. Easy to earn coins to buy more games.  I would recommend this app for all ages.
B004FOA84A|5.0|it was a great game and I even had to look on the computer for hints!  But at the end of the game I was puzzled and a little scared and it would make any sense if they don't make a secend game continuing his travels through time will his granddaughter.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game isn't very sophisticated, but its great for some mindless stress relief. there is a great variety of games.
B0063IH60K|1.0|in the middle of your game or several times during your game ads appear. In fact the screen leaves your game and a movie ad will appear..andthe trailer starts playing.....totally ruins the game
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Arrived on time, decent recording. Ordered as a gift for my dad and I honestly haven't watched it, but I haven't heard him complain about it so it must be alright.
B003Y5H5FG|3.0|I wouldn't normally take time to talk about this movie but I'd like to make a point about something that saddens me within Hollywood and that is: the darn endings.   You have a story that is not original but is still fun and enticing. You have characters that are functioning as archetypes but are still engaging and charismatic. You have the  technical aspect of the film that is, as far as I can see, first rate. The creators obviously had fun and seemed to be honest about the simple pleasure they wanted to share with us. Everybody, it's plain to see, has given their best and a bit more in order to entertain us. The actors, in particular, are way better than what would normally be expected for that kind of product. Even the score is better than average. Plus, the writers are dealing right away with some plot twists in order to move forward instead of stretching them endlessly until the end. And as far as being a remake, the movie was even surprising at some point with some changes here and there, especially in the point of view about who believes what.   But there you have it. All of this is wasted on the fact that a darn product from Hollywood has to last about two hours and needs to have a big ending with lots of special effects. In this case, what the creators had set up was very promising. But it was too much for 120 minutes. At some point, they needed to conclude and wrap up everything in a big fiery conclusion. What had taken a long time to install now needed to be rush to the end. As soon as Jerry the vampire arrives in Vegas, the rest of the movie is sadly lost in a whirlwind of special effects and over the top story devices all made to conclude the story with a bang! Therefore, a character well drawn like Jerry Dandridge, who says: \\"What were you thinking, Charley? That you would just going to walk in here with your little crossbow, and put to bed four hundred years of survival?\\" is left to die like a debutant almost right after saying that great line!  And because everything needs to be rushed, characters are starting to make no sense. For example, Charley is trying to tell his mom about vampires but he has no time to explain... cause the story needs to move along. And he gets upset that she does not believe him! Furthermore, he's scared that his neighbor (Jerry the vampire) might kill her but he tells his mom to trust him and that she simply should not talk to jerry... and he gets out! Without further explanations!   So what do you have? A great pop corn movie, promising and better than average, but that is sadly botched away by an over the top ending and a need to wrap up everything real fast. The well drawn characters are therefore becoming stupid and the great setting up of the story is wasted. A common trend in Hollywood.   They should take example on how the rest of the world, especially the Europeans, are finishing their movies in general. I'm not talking about the rest of their cinematography, their philosophy and how they construct their narratives. Just the end. There's nothing wrong with a little influence.
B0007TKNII|5.0|then you'll love this movie. Personally, I can't stand the music and dialogue, but my sisters are both in choir so of course they love it. The story line isn't bad at all, but be warned there is absolutely a lot of singing in this movie.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|This Christmas Album is one of my all-time favorites. Christina gives you Christmas classics with all sorts of twists. R&B, Pop, Jazz, Blues and Gospel. It's all there.
0765365278|5.0|I'm not gonna lie, this first time I tried to read this book I got a few chapters in and stopped because it was so boring. But a few weeks later I picked it up and started again from the beginning and read it all the way through, no problem. I'm anxious to read it again. There are a few chapters that follow characters that you never see again, and never really gets explained why they are important, but I'm guessing it will all be explained later. Honestly, most of the chapters narrated by the girl get tedious, too, but I still feel like it's a worthy investment. I'm convinced the next one is going to be even better. The overall storyline is actually really enjoyable once you get used to the weird social system (people with lighteyes are better than people with dark, never really addresses what they do with people with so-so eyes). I like Kaladin, and I really think the storylines they introduce will bear fruit later.
0062101897|5.0|I'll cut to the chase. This book is not for the fans of the books. It's more for fans of the movie. If you don't care much about the movies, don't bother with this one. It doesn't add any personal background to the characters or any additional info.  However, if you loved the movies, this will give you a lot of insight, from how the actors were chosen to how the characters were meticulously dressed differently by each director. All the info provided here is about how the movie was made (duh) so if you dig that stuff, you will not be able to put this book down. Though you can hardly lift it up, either; the thing is heavy!  The print quality is excellent. There's nothing I could find fault with, except maybe if they had used thicker paper to imitate an ancient book, I would have loved that.
0439023513|3.0|I have read the first two books in this trilogy.  I likes the first, really liked the second but am having trouble getting through the third.  I am hopeful that it gets better farther along.  I am about 100 pages in but not keeping my interest.
B000002A46|3.0|She has a beautiful voice but do not need the high screamy notes in the songs, so my husband and I were very disappointed.
0439023491|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book, but have to say I enjoyed this one better.  I read through it in a week or two.  My son is reading the first book in school and I have already told him that he needs to reach the second.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app.  This app gives you a 10 day outlook plus live radar in motion along with current conditions.  The live radar is a plus, something other weather apps did not have.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun stuff to escape with! mindless games to destress the day..definitely worth the download. give it a shot, its free!
B005K17RU0|5.0|works as described. useful background notifications when waking up or checking app updates. worth the price easily. even better that its free. no need.  to use the pay version.

B0054JZC6E|2.0|the games are lame. and all the ads and pop-ups are very annoying. not worth it. so dumb and lame
B00000AFWW|5.0|One thing I think thats really cool is Hole transition from hardcore grunge in 1991's Pretty On the Inside to eventually this 1998 pop and kinda girly sounding album Celeb Skin, and it was excellent. Not only are the songs super catchy, but there kinda weird too, like Heaven Tonight sounds really strange at first, but it grows on you, strongly and quickly. I think thats pretty cool.  Also even though its def a pop sound, the lyrics are really provacative and controversial, and its an album made by a band that has something important to say. I like that 'walking contradiction' thing, for lack of a better phrase.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I love the original series, watched it as a kid and it is truly the anime that got me into anime's. They do a bunch of changes but its for the better, it moves the story along more rapidly. I do miss the character development of the original but wow is this one beautiful to look at it. If you are a fan of Evangelion then buy it, its amazing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game I mean games its awesome so awsome awesome awesome. awesome awsome awesome awesome. awesome awesome awsome awesome

0439813786|5.0|Wow!  What a book!<br /><br />Almost like watching a film, almost like reading a comic book, this novel unspools across the pages and fires up the imagination.  It was interesting for me, and I'm an adult.  The main character, Hugo, is 9 years old, and this book is just right for 3rd-4th-5th graders and up.<br /><br />Lots of foreshadowing, lots of character development, lots of the history of cinema, and lots of chase scenes.<br /><br />Excellent, excellent illustrations.  This won a well-deserved Caldecott award.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the game alot. I like the game where you had to get all of the butter flys. overall this is a great game for the ipod touch and the kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok for a free game but the graphics r not that good or the games so I give it a 3
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an ok game the grafics could be better. but being a free game I guess its not all that bad.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A great opportunity to play different games that are challenging and entertaining. required thought and dexterity.  will br playing gor hours and hour
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app! Has great games. They are all different types and its easy to gain points to unlock more games! This will keep you entertained for hours. Only downside is all the ads that periodically pop up.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Graphics are horrible. Games are simple and not fun. I understand its free, but it is absolutely riddled with ads, including ads after every game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is okay. some are hard to control but overall a good time waster that is fun to play
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is okay. some of them are kind of hard but, like i said, it's okay. some of the games are fun, but they have bad graphics.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games may be cheesey but its a good way to pass time. I really enjoy all the games I have unlocked so far.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Lots of fun, simple and quick games. Hits you up with a lot of nag, but at least there is a payout for responding to offers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|plenty of fun games. a lil hard to earn new games without using the offers.. over all surprisingly good app
B003EYVXVY|5.0|The 3D version is amazing, a must see if you have the equipment. Flawless picture and superior sound. I'm using a Panasonic 1080p 3D projector (PT-AE7000U) to project to a 92\\" screen. The experience is on par with 3D theaters, or even better because you always have the best seat and no dirty 3D glasses.  I got the Blu-ray 3D disk for free with the purchase of a Panasonic 3D Blu-ray player.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great but some boards a pretty tricky. Anyway it is a good game and you her a lot of points in a really easy way!!!!!! &lt;3 this game
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I love this game but hate how it freezes after awhile of playing. It keeps me wanting more and makes time fly out the window!
B005HSL626|4.0|I don't see what everyone doesn't like about this game. I find it fun and a good way to kill time, unlike some other games. I did it with a few friends and we had a blast. Maybe they could of added some different stages, but it is worth the download!
B00005JL96|3.0|I love this movie and I had purchased it for our daughter. The dvd itself was in excellant condition but the case was a mess hence the 3 stars. Used-very good was the discription I count the overall appearenece as a whole to include the casing in which it came in. Other then that excellant movie shows how kids really are and that everybody has a need to feel wanted. Have loved this movie since it came out and its very child appropriate unlike other disney movies this one applies to actual kids and kid behavior. Not to mention it shows that not all children are raised or have parents.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja is great, fun, and time consuming. It's fun for all ages my mom, brother, and I can't seem to get enough of it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|does the job. I like solitaire and this is a good, free app. the in between game ads for solitaire games that cost$$ are a little irritating, but it's free and still well worth the download.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game Is very challenging and mind twisting. some games are easy and some are hard. love this game.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I am a die hard Nicholas Sparks fan and this book was okay.  I still think Sparks is one of the best but just not his best novel.  I have read all of them and this one falls a little short on the plot.  The ending of course was a tear jerker but most of his novels are.  I liked the characters but it seemed a little to much with Dawson's rowdy family.  The book would've been better without them.  I thought maybe the husband was going to get the heart and not the son, but either way it would have been the same type of ending.  I will read his future books...and I will always look forward to them..but just slightly disappointed in this one.
1419702238|5.0|This book did not disappoint.  As with all of The Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, there were non-stop laughs.  Excellent read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazingly fun and easy to use! Even a small child could play games with ease. It's fun for everyone!
1451627289|4.0|Although the book was long, it was an easy and  fun read (I read it over a weekend... just couldn't quite put it down).  Truthfully, it's been awhile since I've read a Stephen King novel (to me, they began to have too many \\"unrealistic monster-like developments\\"... starting to become somewhat predictable). I found, however, 11/22/63 to be refreshingly different.  Once I got beyond the \\"time travel\\" premise, the book became more realistic than prior SK books I've read.  I don't know exactly why I didn't give it 5 stars .  I guess I reserve a 5 star rating for books I consider truly \\"great\\" (like the better James Michener type books).  Although this book was a wonderful distraction and lot of fun to read, I don't know that I'd put it in the category of being \\"truly great\\".  If you want to kick back, relax, have some fun and get lost in \\"another time & place\\"... you'll enjoy this book!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great because it not only helps me want read the Bible, but it can also read aloud for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty good games, lots of variety. the more you play, you can earn points to open more games.  it keeps you coming back for more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome. I really like it.it is really fun and I play it a lot great games are on there to
B0052CK5PQ|3.0|Hm, so this is the 21st century book on feminism? I don't think so...  When Moran talks about women, she uses the word \\"we\\" all too frequently and seems to be completely oblivious to cultural and educational differences amongst women. According to her, \\"we\\" women are all modelled after a very stereotypical british middle class girl who reads OK! magazine on a regular basis.  Frankly, I don't feel like part of that \\"we\\" and I don't want to be. There are actually women out there who have more important things to do than obsessing about looks, fashion, celebrities and relationships.   The book makes me want to scream: \\"Wake up Caitlin, this is the 21st century and women do exist who have contributed a lot more to human culture and development than Lady Gaga (and pssst, this has actually started a long time before the 80ties)!\\"  A lot of the stuff she writes is very badly researched or not researched at all and only mildly funny.  This book would benefit immensely from interchanging \\"we\\" with \\"I\\" and \\"women\\" with \\"some women with a british middle class cultural background\\" as it also has very charming sections where Moran gives us an account of her personal life.  But overall Morans attempt to be a self-proclaimed speaker of womenhood comes along in disappointingly inappropriate and presumptous tones. In short, an entertaining, intellectual featherweight with a misleading title.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I just finished watching this movie a few minutes ago. I had been putting off watching it for quite sometime, fearing it would not be good. But, Marisa Tomei is in the film, (in a supporting role).. I like her a lot.. I have since the '80's when she was on the tv show \\"A Different World.\\" Also, in previous films, Emma Stone has been charming, and Steve Carell is funny at least some of the time.. so finally I gave in and watched this movie.<br /><br />Yes, there have been other films before with a suave younger guy helping a hapless older guy.. or something like that. I was concerned this would be entirely formulaic and so forth, but it was better than I'd hoped.<br /><br />The casting and acting were rather good, and the story had enough little turns in it and fun moments to stay interesting. The cast worked well together, and there were many likeable people in this film. Julianne Moore is one of my least favorite actresses, but even she did fairly well.<br /><br />The kids were great, especially Analeigh Tipton as Jessica, the babysitter, and Jonah Bobo, who played Robbie Weaver, son of Cal Weaver (Carell's character). They both played their roles with a lot of heart, and Bobo was quite funny.<br /><br />I liked how the film showed that young people, even though they are young, can have very strong emotions and deep thoughts about life, and that they should be taken seriously. I remember how things felt when I was 13 (which was a looong time ago), and I am glad this film delved into the emotional lives of teens in an honest way.<br /><br />The movie was also good about showing what an utter mess and ruin infidelity and divorce can cause. And that the hook-up culture and lifestyle can leave people feeling empty. This movie came out with a strong message about the importance of family, and genuine love.<br /><br />Even the music was good. I'm going to try to purchase several songs from the soundtrack. Right now, at the time I am writing this review, here on Amazon, all the mp3's are listed as \\"album only,\\" so what I am going to do is try to track down some of these songs on other legitimate pay-per-song download sites (if a song is worth listening to, it is worth paying for).. some of the songs may have been previously released on earlier albums by the various artists. Some of these songs might already be found in the Amazon mp3 store, as part of other albums. This happens sometimes. Also, as is usually the case with most movies, some of the songs in this film are not on the soundtrack. But, if you do some looking online, you'll be able to find a complete list. I typed in \\"all the songs from crazy stupid love\\" into google, and found a list.<br /><br />Anyway.. Not a family film.. some of the parts were pretty strong for a PG-13 movie, so I suggest not watching this with the kids..<br /><br />But.. overall a good movie, worth watching, and I am glad I rented it.going to do is try to track down some of these songs on other legitimate pay-per-song download sites (if a song is worth listening to, it is worth paying for).. some of the songs may have been previously released on earlier albums by the various artists.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|See title. If the developer had released any one of the games that I've seen so far on its own, it would have been terrible. But with them all together and with the unlock system, Great.
0061719544|5.0|Funny, Craig just hits every button... Great for expats, new citizens and those of us born here... Bought as a gift, rave reviews :)
0307279189|5.0|I picked this book up not expecting to learn a great deal about running, shoes and my feet but I did.  I also didn't expect to learn as much about the remote village and it's Indians in Mexico.  Last, I didn't expect such a good story that was true.  Great book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app, I've been using it for almost a year and really like the improvements that have been put into it. Keep up the good work!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Over the years I've read one thriller after another.  Legal thrillers, medical thrillers, natural disaster thrillers, you name it and they have filled a lot of space on my bookshelves and now my Kindle, too.  But along came The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and this took the form of a thriller unlike any of the others.  It is a post-apocalyptic novel where the new America, divided into twelve districts, holds The Hunger Games each year like a pathological throwback to the gladiator days.  These modern-day gladiators are children, pre-teens and teenagers whose names are drawn and who must go into an arena that is acres and acres of land and hunt each other down until there is only one survivor. They must find their own food and water to stay alive while cameras are everywhere and the entire population must watch the games on television.  The Hunger Games is like a futuristic reality show that has gone awry, and although the games are quite serious business, it shows the superficiality of image on television by the exaggerated hair, makeup and fashion that these kids must be subjected to in the opening ceremony.  I couldn't put this one down.  I say that about a lot of books I read, but the main character, Katniss Evergreen, is so brave, bold and strong in the face of fear and adversity that staying on her side isn't even questionable.  There is wonderful character development in the book, and following through to the end to find out who wins the Hunger Games keeps the reader glued to the book. Although written for young adults, the book has captured many an adult reader like myself.  First in a trilogy, at the end of this one the only thing I wanted to do was to go on to the next book, which is Catching Fire, which is exactly what I did.  The Hunger Games has been on my Kindle for a while, and if I remember correctly, it was a free book for the Kindle.  I didn't pay that much attention to it until the other day while at a mall, I saw The Hunger Games calendar and figured there is something more to the book than I realized.   It's a great read with some violence, but no offensive language, and it's going to be a movie.  Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) will play Katniss.  Highly recommended.
B006UAWH2S|4.0|This was a well made, well-acted movie about how people respond to losing their senses. It explores different aspects of human nature - both the positive and negative sides. There are some nice cinematic moments as well.

B002ZG98VE|2.0|I was anticipating watching this film because since childhood I've always been a fan of Robin Hood movies, from Errol Flynn to Kevin Costner and Sean Connery.  This $20 million rendition has a phenomenal cast wasted on a flaccid script.  I am stunned director Ridley Scott has lost his touch for compelling filmaking. \\"Gladiator\\" is about 12 years old, and I've seen it a zillion times and it still holds up with every viewing - a true classic.<br /><br />  Unfortunately Ridley Scott's rendition of Robin Hood falls flat as a pancake.  The film opens with a textbook version of a paint-by-the numbers battle scene - then moves to the mother of the King of England grumpy because her son has not produced an heir with his wife but is sleeping with what she calls \\"A French Piece of Pastry\\" - the niece of the French king.  From that scene it is downhill, and when I realized this is a cartoon-ish rendition of the classic Robin Hood tale.  Most of the film is just violent, violent, violent.  If you are into endless battle scenes and like violence - you might enjoy this film.  There are battle scenes with no explanation what circumstances lead up to the cause of the battle.<br /><br />  Cate Blanchette is given little to do except act \\"feisty\\" when improbably she dressed up in knights armour at the close of the film and does her duty in battle to defend the realm.  There is no chemistry between Cate Blanchette and Russel Crowe - they are both excellent actors and the problem in this film must be the director, Ridley Scott never embodies any part of the film with compelling interest to hold the viewer.  I never felt a pulse beat in the scenes between Cate Blanchette and Robin Hood - they don't really seem to have any romantic heat - the sort of feeling bewteen arranged marriages is what I felt from them, nothing resembling true lovers.<br /><br />  What a waste of an absolutely terrific cast - if a director can't make an interesting film with the likes of Max Von Sydown, Mark Strong, Mark Addy, Cate Blanchette and Russel Crowe then he needs to retire from film making.<br /><br />  It's OK if you've got some spare time on a rainy afternoon and it's on cable TV, but I wouldn't buy the DVD or waste a space in my Netflix queue for this stale re-hash of a classic tale.  If you want to see a rollicking romp of the Robin Hood tale - even the 1940's old chestnut with Errol Flynn is more gripping.  For a comical lighter version of Robin Hood, the Kevin Costner version \\"Robin Hood Prince of Thieves\\" is wonderful - Alan Rickman absolutely steals the film as Sherrif of Notthingham - a memorable rendition of comic villianary as the \\"Man You Love to Hate.\\"  \\"Robin and Marion\\" with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn as a middle aged version of the hero and heroine is also a better version than this Ridley Scott mish-mash.tte and Russel Crowe then he needs to retire from film making.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|It works really well on Galaxy 1.  It's freaking amazing app, and I can't believe Amazon was giving it away for free.  I don't have a lot of use for it, but it's just so cool!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app and my family loves it. my daughter loves all the games and my son loves the tank game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good and fun, lots of games to play. never get bored with this, always another game to play. no better price than free!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its free..and the mini games are cool. and they keep adding games. but don't expect infinity blade. some are better than others and you shouldn't have to do any in app purchases
B0063IH60K|5.0|I Love the options on this game! So many ways to play. You can customize to fit your preferences too.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Much more comprehensive than I expected from a free app.  The reading plans are a little more difficult to navigate than I would like,but that may be my learning curve.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Purchased this item as a gift for a family member. The case came in excellent condition with no scratches or dents, completely wrapped in plastic as to be expected with a new product.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I just love this series and the book, even though they are both different. I love how differen this is  and how they kept they correctness for verbaine (if you read about the herbs mythological history).  Its funny to see the differences between the book and the show, but I will contuine to read and watch both, I like the chance in pace from the mundane vampire stuff thats out.
0740748475|5.0|This is a totally awesome collection. It's very heavy and the outside box had a little crunch in it. But never mind...because this is a great collection for the real fans.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|after they made an update it does not work anymore. update should be in improvement products not make them bad.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Some of the games are fun, but I don't think they should cost as much as they do to unlock a new game. Seems like they should tell you that only five games are available with purchase. You shouldnt have a surprise afterwords.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I purchased 3 soundtracks for christmas gifts this year and all my recipients were not disappointed..Everybody loved the music from the show. One of the best music cd's you'll ever listen to.  It was worth the money.

B005QPGHQU|3.0|Evanescence's latest album is good and has a few excellent songs on it. Amy Lee's vocals are awesome but the music is missing something.  Unfortunately it is a further decline from Fallen and The Open Door.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Mmmmm.  The cover is light weight as I expect it to be. But now I have some concerns about dropping my Kindle with such limited protection. I hope someone come out with a protection cover like the one I have for my iPhone.  Until then, I will use this one and will be extremely careful not to drop it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app. Can even play games like civilization from the connected computer! Easy to use and has almost no learning curve.

0316017930|3.0|Gladwell's newest book describes what it takes to become successful. His conversational tone is engaging and his research insightful. The reason I gave it only three stars is that the narrative borders on frenetic; the pace is too fast, too repetitive and the book is over before it even began.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Moon Phase Pro is the best it is educational and is great for young astronamers and older I strongly reccomend it. It is great for teachers and students.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very entertaining series. Simple, clear passages with interesting character sketches. Took about a day to read each book, but had a great bang for the buck.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Good game. But the recent demonic ad was not appropriate. It was pure evil.  I have DELETED it from my computer. John 3:16.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I'm not convinced that this isn't some kind of malware, but this app does work sporadically on my kindle fire. I've downloaded several videos with this app, but lately it's been crashing a lot and pop ups keep trying to get me to download some update but not through the app store. kinda sketchy
B0001HAISG|5.0|I love this movie.  It is well acted and directed, the sets are beautiful and its absolutely a charming telling of Peter Pan.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|This is a christmas gift for my grandaughter.  She is  enjoying it very much and it made a easy gift for  me.  It was also half the price than other stores I  checked in.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very fun and amusing. You play a variety of games all in one! fun for the whole family.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers is my personal favorite film of the trilogy, because of the Battle of Helm's Deep. So I watched the extended version. It seems to include quite a bit of extra footage, maybe 40 minutes. You can't really tell what's all that new because it is seamlessly edited. However, it does make a great, taut film drag a bit. It's obvious why the extra footage was cut from the theatrical release. It's for true fanatics only.
B005974CNA|2.0|Upon listening to this album, I can tell my opinion right now that Dream Theater is not a Prog Rock oriented band anymore (Although they claim to be Prog Metal, they are defined in the past as basically a prog rock band mixed w/ hard rock elements). They basically morphed into a More Heavy Metal band that most prog rock afficandos despise, appealing to the taste of the youth and the mass producing music industry critics that upon no question damaged their Image that they built strongly in the past.   I've been a fan since the day my brother let me hear Images and Words. Through out the 90's till 2000, DT has been by far a staple musical group to my taste like the other genres I listen to. However, since the last 5-6 albums: from Six Degrees to ADTOE, this group has gone by far too extreme and too mundane in composition that their ideas are just too redundant and the riff structures are just recycled parts of previous albums from 2001 till the present.    I agree, Mike Portnoy is right after all! Regardless of the selfish notion that he wants to hold the group on a leash, I believe he was trying to steer the DT boat to a right direction by asking them to have a hiatus and regroup after a few years. Rather than looking at that perspective, JP and the gang went to the more route of glamour, success and more self destructing ways of composing music.   In General, Dream Theater will be remembered as a band who did brought Prog Rock music to its popularity (The Spirit \\"DID NOT\\" Carry On after the Metropolis pt2 world tour and the Live Scenes from NY concert was finished). Sadly, It has too end this way. If there is anything else for this group to salvage its true artistic reputation that they captured during the first 10 years (from WDADU to SFAM), the best recourse is to remove Labrie, Rudess, and Mangini. Myung and Petrucci should be able to make amends w/ Portnoy and reform DT to a more robust and Prog rock oriented group that was known in the past.   To finalize, my take on this album is just one sentence: Total CRAP!!!   EDIT: if you want my take on the songs in this album, The album is trying to capture what was reminiscent of Images and Words (best example is On the backs of Angels. The song is more like Pull me Under dressed in sheep's clothing). Songs like Lost Not Forgotten, Outcry, Breaking all Illusions are very much going into that angle. These plus most of the songs are like I said, recycled riffs from some of their previous albums. Mangini's overuse of Double bass drumming is also too hyped up and I find his style too square and too structed compared to Portnoy's. Overall, I could've given the album a 1 star. But since most dismayed critics gave it 2 stars, I might as well give it just not to insult the band.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app offers more than I thought possible. I love the different versions and the different plans to help you in you're studies. It's great!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have both of the Quell puzzle games, and I love them both.  This game is actually relaxing to play!  I had never played a puzzle challenge game (except solitaire games) and I had no idea how much fun they can be!  Definately worth the small investment for the hours of fun.. and there are so many levels that by the time you have solved it, you can start all over again and it is still challenging!
B005WKKI96|3.0|I heard excerpts from this album during an interview with Lila Downs on public radio, and thought it sounded wonderful, so I ordered a copy of the \\"burned to order\\" CD.  The content of the CD is of a high quality, and I was not disappointed in that regard.  Two aspects of the purchase were, however, disappointing.  The \\"set list\\" as it appears on a monitor, when one is playing the CD, is not that of \\"Pecados y Milagros,\\" but that of \\"Una Sangre/One Blood,\\" a different album by Downs.  This makes it difficult to select a favorite track, as the title shown will be something completely different.  In addition, although Downs is a Spanish language artist, she is billed as \\"Mexican-American\\" and it would make sense in this increasingly polyglot world to provide at least minimal liner notes in English, but the entire printed insert is monolingual Spanish.  Since so much of Downs's chosen repertory has socially relevant context, I should think she would be anxious to involve Anglophones in her causes, of which they might be ignorant, but this does not appear to be one of her priorities.  It's really rather surprising, after hearing the interview which originally drew my attention to the artist to uncover this bar to cross-border understanding.  In short, while Downs is a consummate artist, talented songwriter, and elegant, smoky-voiced singer, and while the album is comprised of sensitive, emotive, and thought-provoking material, my pleasure in it was dampened by the erroneous on-disc set list and the absence of any English text at all to clarify the liner notes.
B005GVF95O|5.0|What a fantastic app for little ones!  This is a clean, concise puzzle game that will help kids with thier hand/eye co-ordination, teach them the excitement of solving things on their own and give a rral boost to their egos!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I've not read the book, but the movie is a very good one. If anyone needs a primer on what the world was like just a few decades ago, this should be watched. It's one thing to read about segregation, another to simply see it, and see it just as it was, a way of life.  There's characters you cheer for, characters you loathe and ones you just want to slap.  Definitely a movie that's worth watching, and very probably one that, if I were a teacher teaching social studies, it could be worth showing to the students because it shows a way of life and a mindset that many don't even remember existed.
B0063GORYU|4.0|awesome game!  better than the computer programs.  moves are very helpful.  I love the game and would recommend it to anyone!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The app is alright. It does have a lot of games, but you need points to unlock the majority of them. That just means a lot of playing the same games.

B0024HH32A|2.0|The film is easily five stars, but this Blu-Ray transfer only gets two. Despite so many reviewers complaining about film grain and shoddy picture quality/clarity, the main problem is that the image has been tampered with in regard to size. The picture quality is perfectly fine, considering that this film was not shot in hi-def and not even with a very big budget (this is as clear as M*A*S*H will get...and the image clarity is better than ever).   The only problem I have, is that the film's title did NOT fit on the screen (the left leg of the letter \\"M\\" and half of the right leg of the letter \\"H\\" are off screen when the title is shown during the film's opening). I immediately threw on my old standard DVD for a comparison, and that one fit perfectly. In fact, on the standard DVD, there is a comfortable margin of space on screen to the left and right of the title. This sizing error continues throughout the entire Blu-Ray version of the film. At one point, Altman holds a shot which is intended to be a take on \\"The Last Supper\\", and the character sitting on the far right end of the table is only half in the frame (this compromises the artistic intent of the director). I checked my television settings, and they were all in proper order.  This is one of my favorite films, and I hope this problem is remedied. I hope Criterion will eventually put out a release, as this is also a very important film.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|It is extremely easy to achieve incredible results with this extraordinary app!  Works flawlessly on my HTC EVO and the results never fail to impress.  Highly recommended!

B004LP3AYI|1.0|I own these books in paperback, and have read them several times.  Now that I have my Kindle, I'm purchasing them and re-reading them again.... But whooo-eeeee, does the Kindle version need to be edited!  I can't believe the number of mistakes!  The first book wasn't too bad, the second book was horrendous, and just starting the third book, it looks about the same.  Seriously, if someone wants to hire me, I'd be happy to fix these!  This series is too good to let these bad editions be out in Kindle edition.....shame, shame!  Love the series, but the mistakes in the Kindle version really take away from the enjoyment when reading it.    I honestly have no idea what rating to give this!  Giving it a one because of bad editing (would give it a zero because of that if I could), but the books themselves are all four or five stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are challenging and i like that.  I could play for hours. only thing is how many points the games cost.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|decent games. not the hippest games around but its fun to play on. I.like that u have to keep playing to get more games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great way to make a long road trip finish sooner. download took a while, though I blame the connection I had at the time.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I was amazed that this app was the free app of the day. Its really handy if you have spotify and movies that are on your hard drive at home. This puts cloud.to.the next level.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|think unlocking games shouldnt be so rediculously difficult. makes it a bit less enjoyable. but a fun time consumer. so.I guess its.okay.in.the long run.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I have to admit, when i first seen this cover i had to have it but hesitated because of the reviews. I went with it anyways and im glad i did because i love it and it actually does fit the fire, i have no problem with it. It's a beautiful cover.

B005POK858|1.0|I regret buying this app :l the graphics are not what I expected, should have looked at the pictures better
B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an amazing book. Stieg Larsson is a genius with endings to make us want to grab and read the next one. Although the beginning is slow you soon can't put it down. It's a thriller that has enough twists and turns will leave you wondering and craving at what comes next.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I just as able to have a video call(my other party could not see me) control the music in my house, print some documents... all flawlessly! This is a great app you can use to even check if your dog is ok if you leave it visible from your computer camera. Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Has any version you can think of, easy navigation, and more features than you'll ever need. from dailey reading,  to in-depth study, to casual browsing; this app works best.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|We have a very small living room and we became very use to standing right up against the couch to get the Kinect to work.  Our 5 year old was having a real hard time with the Kinect games recognizing him, so much that he actually did not like playing the system.  So for $20 despite all the bad reviews, I gave it a try.  It works as advertised.  We have it below our TV and it makes a world of difference.  I find myself backing up out of habbit and I go out of range.  So, I'm sure I'll get use to having actual space behind me to enjoy the kinect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are so many fun games with this app. and, its free! you cant beat that! I recommend downloading these games. there are lots of fun time wasting games. my daughter loves to play it in the car and when we are away from home for long periods of time.
B000KXUIGI|5.0|Such a good price for such a lovely book.  It was packaged really well and my friend freaked out when she opened it.  I had been looking for a copy for years in used bookstores and I'm so glad I resorted tho the internet.  Yay!
1439130833|4.0|This is a daily Secret devotional, from which you may tear the pages away, but it is NOT a calendar.  Dates are not printed on the sheets.  The description is very vague and until I purchased it, I was not really sure what it was.  The messages are very good, but I wanted a page a day calendar comprised of The Secret messages. I will still use the product, but not as a calendar
B004VMVTNU|2.0|I can't change the title of the alarm now. Is very aggravating because it worked before update. I should always read reviews before I update a application again. I hope you fix it and then I can trust it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! Fun, rewarding, and challenging! Highly recommended! I love the different games and the fact that you have to earn them. Get this game today! All in one games really surprised me.
B006IO045S|5.0|Another fabulous episode of Castle! Very strange case... I didn't see it coming at all! I love the mystery, but what I love most about Castle is the humor and light heartedness that aren't in other cop shows. It's actually fun to watch, and this episode was right in line with that! Highly recommend it along with the rest of season 4!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|This was a 5 star app until it stopped recording shows even tho it says it is recording. Two emails to cust. service unanswered.

B000W91RUG|5.0|As the parent of a son with autism, I find Sheldon hilarious. If you can't laugh at your life, it can be unbearable. Sheldon has many traits of Aspberger's (high functioning autism), and whether the writers have that intent or not, seeing the humorous side of this disorders symptoms is refreshing in a world where autism is often portrayed so negatively.

B004HZ76FQ|1.0|I loved this game when I first downloaded it, but I had to move the phone so hard for reaction that I have now been diagnosed with severe tennis elbow and this was the only thing that could have caused it. I no longer play due to this.

B003RRY60S|4.0|I recently became a huge Doctor Who fan and after finishing the last season was a bit disappointed to be finished. I was rather excited when I came across the Doctor Who books, of which there appears to be hundreds. What interested me most was the 'Doctor Who New Adventures' novels as they follow the Ninth Doctor onward.<br /><br />I decided to start with 'The Stone Rose' because it is the first story with the Tenth Doctor, as played by David Tennant because he was my favorite. I was very disappointed when he regenerated so I was glad to see I could get more of him from the books. Rayner does a pretty decent job keeping true to the series and to the character of the Doctor himself as well as the other characters such as Rose (Billie Piper). I found reading the books to be a lot like watching the shows because in my mind I could really picture Rose and the Doctor as Raynor portrayed them. I'm really excited to start the next one, however I have decided to go back to the beginning of the new series with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is awesome. The reason I like this game is it is fun,and addicting.I recommend this game to anyone who likes having fun.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  My son, who is about the same age as the boy in the film, really enjoyed it.  Real Steel is about a washed up loser named Wolverine who decides to fight robots after getting kicked out of the X-Men.  Well... maybe that's not entirely accurate, but the dude is a washed up loser nonetheless.  The guy fights robots for a living, but hits a bit of a hurdle when a girl that he knocked up dies and he gets temporary custody of the kid.  One thing the guy has going for him is his pseudo girlfriend - I think she was lost on some island or something before making it back to civilization to date losers who fight robots.  Well... regardless of her origins, she likes filthy dudes who gamble and make poor life decisions.    Sooo... to make a long story short, the kid finds an old sparing robot named \\"Atom\\" (get it, Adam?) buried in a junk heap, fixes it up, and takes to the robot fighting circuit.  Etc, etc, etc.  Hey - is it just me or do some of the fight scenes - especially in the last fight with Zeus, mimic Rocky fights?  I swear I was watching Rocky with robots.  I'm not saying it was just close either... I'm talking nearly identical.  I bet you could do a side-by-side comparison and track some of the same moves.    Oh - and did anyone else get the impression that perhaps the sparing robot was actually designed by that crazy Asian engineer who designed Zeus?  Recall that he gets asked if Zeus was his best creation and he avoids the question.  Also recall that the owner of Zeus wants to buy Atom - for no reason really.  Also recall that the Asian engineer is always casting worried looks around when he see Atom.  Why?  The movie never actually explains this.  Seems to me like there was a sub-plot that got left out.  In terms of special effects, the robots look pretty good.  Frankly, the Transformer movies should have done something a little more like Real Steel.  The fighting robots look \\"feasible\\" whereas the Transformers look like a bunch of CGI nonsense.    The end result is a movie in which basically everything is predictable - including the end if you have seen Rocky.  However, I don't think that detracted from the film.  My son really liked it and he is in the demographic this film is shooting for.    You, of course, know that my taste is impeccable and you live your life based on my reviews.  If you don't, then you better start!  Therefore, you can feel safe watching this film.  4 stars.  Never throw around 5 stars lightly.  I'd probably give it 3 stars based on just my unquestionable taste, but I'm bumping it to 4 because of my son's fondness for the film
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun with the variety of games you can play, but the games start costing way too Mich so you have to replay previous games a LOT. Other than that, I would recommend this game to anyone.
B0002DXEPI|3.0|I love this movie and have since childhood. This review is not concerning the film, but the actual DVD that I received.  I did not realize that this would not play in my USA-purchased DVD player (Went back and looked; it does state this in the description, but wish it had been more prominent. Even still, I accept fault for overlooking it.) I WAS able to play it on my laptop, though, so the purchase is not a total loss.  One quirk: (In the English version) there are subtitles during the Jewish wedding scene, something I had never seen before and I actually enjoyed very much. Growing up, I never knew what they were saying. Much of it is clear from the tone/expressions but it was still kind of nice to see the actual words. Then.... the subtitles strangely continued halfway through the next scene and then stop again. It seems like a poor editing oversight. I can't say that it took away from the film itself, but might be a useful tip to future purchasers.  Even with these problems, I'm still glad that I have a copy of this fun little film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game. fun game.play it.it is free. you will enjoy.try it. BTW I am just doing this for points. so have fun
0545259088|5.0|This one just about killed me.  As the ending approached my feet were beating like crazy.  My husband kept watching me, afraid to say a word.  I think he got it just by my body language.  That said, Maggie out did herself.  She brought us to a very realistic conclusion to Sam and Grace's wolf / human problem.  I was pleased with how Cole's and Isabel's characters developed.  Again she had our emotions going wild as more and more gripping scenes unfolded.  It begins with Shelby killing Oliva who has just transformed back into human when Shelby spots her.  Grace is still a wolf.  Sam is kind of lost w/o her and is going through the motions of life waiting for her to return.  Cole is working on a real cure to becoming a wolf.  Oliva's body is found and Isabel's father goes all out to get the solves taken off state protection so they can kill them all.  He is still hurting from the death of Jack.    What unfolds is dramatic and very realistic.  Fantastic read.    A few questions I'm left with revolve around the red coffee pot and Sam's wolf eyes :).
B005HSL626|5.0|my favorite game ever. I could play it 7days a week 365 days a year. if you are looking for fun FREE games this would be the one to pick.it is the BESTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!words can not describe how great it is.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|*spoiler   I absolutely hate the ending of the series. Prim dies? Are you kidding me? What was the whole point of Katniss volunteering to take her place as tribute for the Games if you're just going to kill her off? And the way she dies is horrible. She blows up? What? If you were going to have her die, have her die like Rue died. This way Katniss could honor her sister properly and get a chance to say goodbye. Katniss hadnt seen Prim for weeks because she was deployed to the Capitol. And her goodbye is a short half seconded before she gets blow to bits. And what was the whole point of writing about Katniss traveling through the capitol to get Snow, just to find out it was completely irrelevant because the Rebels got him anyways. That was a waste of 7 chapter and all those characters lives.   And it doesnt even end on a happy note. Katniss still has nightmares and Peeta still has sudden urges to kill her. Horrible.

B003Y5H53S|5.0|I bought this after waiting a very long time to have it come out on DVD. I had seen the trailers and laughed out loud at them. I'd watched them all several times as a matter of fact. I was ready to laugh,  but I was overjoyed to discover a great western film based on all those cowboy stories I loved as a kid.   This isn't for children. It is animation for adults. The plot is simple and action might be okay for older kids, but small children will be bored because the inside joke type humor will be over their heads.   With more twists and turns than a mountain road, this tale is funny, shocking and has a message. It also has a collection of very interesting desert critters that  will have you coming back again and again.  One of the special features is very entertaining as it shows the actual animals that ispired this strange cast of charcters and accents. In watching the how-it-was-done trailers, the actors were twice as fun as they got to play out the action and ad lib as they acted their lines instead of merely reading them.  One to watch when you want to laugh out loud and be reminded of artistic genius.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Of course my family loves the last 2 tracks/hits on the show, but after watching the concert, WOW, she is good.  Warning though, she does use quite a bit of foul language, so keep that in mind if your watching with the kids.  Her album is about basically hating her ex-boyfriend, so that is where the language originates.
B005N1E8A4|5.0|Just watched this 3D concert from Kylie Minogue and words cannot describe the AWESOME and REAL experience on 3D this concert has. You can feel like you can touch her. So real visual 3D effect, the details, the sharpness and depth on the screen makes you feel like you are there by the stage watching this concert live. This concert was recorded on 3D and it definitely shows the incredible quality on 3D. I can say that after Avatar, this is the BEST 3D experience I had on a 3D TV, cause I had the same feel like \\"being there\\" or transported via the 3D experience. This 3D Blu Ray is a MUST HAVE to any person who likes 3D TV regardless if you are a Kylie fan or not. This concert has a lot of visual effects, great dancers, choreography and the stage is incredibly beautiful with greek columns and light effects that come out of your screen like you are there live. 10 stars to this 3D Blu Ray. Buy it !!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not very impressed. some games are very easy, a little too easy, while others are super hard. directions are vague at best and the graphics are mediocre.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. its a bunch of games in one and it never gets boring. But some games are harder then others which is kind of upsetting
B000EXDS5M|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a teenager. It was the first movie I saw that starred Paul Newman or Robert Redford, not necessarily both in the same movie. I've always been a fan of movies from the 60's and before, especially the 50's. This has been one of my favourite movies since. I've since become a huge fan of Paul Newman. But this movie is amazing in so many ways.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Give it a try!! It's fun to open the other door's to new games-- it would b nice if there were some casino games :)

B004FOA84A|4.0|Runs great on Android Galaxy. Only takes few hours to solve it. It is a fun game, but I want more for the money.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Its a great throw back to the earlier final fantasy games  The voice over is a nice tuch and I hope they add an english one to the whole game instead of just the battle sequences  The character skill developement is pure geniouse however the merit point system would be better if the results were more immediate or if you gained more than one merit point per level

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used Bible apps before but non have had this much flexability and options. I love using this app for my Bible study because I can change versions without losing my place. At church, it is great because my pastor sometimes uses different versions and it allows me to keep up with him.
B004EPZ0BG|1.0|This movie is fair at best.  I do believe that just because these two are in it it people think it deserves to be watched.  I certainly wouldn't waste my time watching it again and wish I hadn't  rented it this time.  I don't believe either one of the \\"stars\\" can act and the so-called plot has been done over and over again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome! so many cool games to choose from! there are a lot of games too! awesome game.
B00318COS4|5.0|As a previous reviewer stated, this is art -- a true masterpiece of adventure gaming. A little indie jewel made by a rather small team with a big talent. The gusto that went into it is felt throughout the experience. Creative and bold, Machinarium offers stylish, whimsical visuals, memorable characters, simple and intuitive gameplay, engaging puzzles (give your brain a jog!) and (last but not least) a soundtrack that stands out on its own. Takes a while to arrive from overseas, but it's definitely worth the wait.  If you do buy it, there's one thing to keep in mind: Machinarium uses Flash technology, so savegames are stored in a folder in your disk where Flash leaves its browser cookies go. What this means is that your browser and maintenance utilities like CCleaner and Advanced SystemCare are very likely to wipe your savegames out unless you tell them otherwise. Visit the forums for details on how to do this.

0385344228|5.0|William Landay's latest novel, Defending Jacob, has left me thinking long after I have turned the last page. This novel was so interesting to me that I began it late one night and couldn't put it down until it was finished.   Andrew Barber has spent his life building a reputation as a competent County DA, a good husband, and good father. When a fourteen year old classmate of his son Jacob's is murdered in a nearby park along a walking path, Barber does what he always does - begins looking for clues as to what happened.  However, before long he is removed from the case and his son is arrested for killing Ben Rifkin. While there is some evidence that Jacob was at the crime scene, Jacob is able to reasonably explain this. Yet other disturbing things pop up, too. Jacob lacks the ability to empathize with others. He owned a knife much like the one used to kill Ben. And he also possesses a gene that makes him prone to violence. A gene Andrew has just discovered he has as well, as does his father who is serving a life sentence in prison.   I debated over the course of this book whether I thought Jacob was guilty or not. Landay does a great job of presenting both sides and letting readers do some of their own interpreting. And in a way reminiscent of Jodi Picoult, throws in a twist at the end that will leave you with your mouth open.   I am so excited for this one to be published because I can't wait to talk about it with someone who has read it. My reading in 2012 has certainly started on a high note. I can't wait to see what other fabulous books are out there.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it really looks like very cool! i like it verymuch. it runs well on my kindle fire.and you like  it?

What a great surprise, and a great holiday for me this year!
B005ZUR724|1.0|Great game but you cant play it on your kindle fire.  I played heavily and bought the extras, now I cant play because of a non-existent update.  It's basically a waste of time and money for Kindle users.  I wonder if Nook customers are having the same issue?
B0063GORYU|5.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and was surprised to enjoy it so much. I love Solitaire and this is a wonderful alternative.

B000002AGN|5.0|This album brought jazz from the smoke-filled gin joints to living rooms and Carnegie Hall.  It demonstrated that jazz (has been and) can be a thinking person's milieu.  It features four virtuosos, master music makers.  It showed that the drums are more than timekeeping devices -- that they can stand next to any other instrument for musicality. And that there's nothing \\"odd\\" about odd time meters.  That's all.  For those reasons, and many more, this album deserves and needs to be on the \\"shelf\\" of anyone who considers themselves a lover of music, especially jazz.  Joe and Paul are gone.  Dave is 90+.  This music, however, will NEVER die.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are worth a lot. and I meen A LOT. some are frustrating. but you know its my type of games. hard yet satisfying.
B002LC2DQ4|1.0|I made a mistake.  The chip sounded good, but it did not work.  The problem, according to Olympus tech support, is that my camera does not support such a large capacity memory card.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|For being a free app, this app has a lot of different games that could spark a liking for anyone.
0684853523|5.0|I've read a lot of books about the craft of writing, and this is one of the few I ever return to. (The other one is \\"The Art of Dramatic Writing\\" by Lajos Egri.) Whether or not you're a Stephen King fan, I think you'll find this book worthwhile. It's an easy read, but full of real-world good advise.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Just rented WARRIOR from AMZN Instant Video. Love the movie! Going to purchase the DVD and soundtrack to show my support.   ***Message to movie producers:*** Please keep making movies like WARRIOR. MMA fans will reward you. Thanks.
140131046X|3.0|I haven't read any of the author's other (all well regarded) books.  I was up for a life lesson and bought the book with kind of high hopes.  I rated it \\"three stars\\" which puts me in the very low percentile of reviews.  It was a good book and a nice read.  Up front the author dutifully assembles exhibits (anecdotes) to support the ending.  To me it just didn't hit me as a \\"life changer\\" as so many other people have expressed.  I'm sure I'll pass the book along to a friend and encourage them to read it.  But, if you are looking for more than a springboard to more than \\"a little\\" faith, this might not be your book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|the book has changed my life in ways no one can imagine. simply mind blowing. it changed my views on everything in my life.
B004FOA84A|5.0|The puzzles in this are nowhere near as difficult as the ones in 7th Guest or Myst, but they are the same kind of puzzles and my 6-year-old and I had a blast plating this game! It's short, but ABSOLUTELY a value for $1. Right now I am going to go looking for more games in this genre and by this publisher.<br /><br />If I were an adult looking for a challenging game to play on my own, I would want something more than this. But...<br /><br />* As a game to play with your kid, this is great!<br />* For a $1 diversion, this is great!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great app.  I couldn't stop playing it all day.  Some of the games are hard, but that's okay.
0385534639|5.0|I don't even know how to begin to describe my experience in reading The Night Circus, because that's what it was, an experience. The book had been in the periphery of my life since before publication, I'd heard several of my book industry colleagues discuss it. I filed those conversations away.   When it came time to leave for Taos for my Christmas holiday, I knew I needed a book to take along. Circumstances dictated I was unable to get the book before I left town, what a fortuitous turn of events. I procured my copy at Moby Dickens the day I arrived. Moby Dickens is a very special shop in the middle of Old Taos. Much to my delight, it was brimming over with customers. (Who says Independent Bookstores are passe?)   As soon as I got back to the hotel I opened up the book, and fell right in to the story. I don't want to give too much away, because I want everyone to experience the book on their own, without the lens of my perspective.   This was the first book I had read since leaving my post as a bookstore manager for the field of librarian that made me regret my decision, even for a moment. I wanted to have read an Advanced Reader's Copy so I could have planned a huge release party in my store. I wanted to walk up to every single customer, regardless of what they were buying and tell them about Night Circus. I wanted to wear black and white everyday, with a different red accent, just to see who would notice. I could have sold the crap out of that book, and I knew whoever it was who was in my old post now would not have given the book a second thought. I felt bad for all my old customers, and hoped that the book would find itself into their life another way.   I know some people will read this book on an e-reader, but this magical book demands to be read on paper. The dust jacket, the interior art, the striped inlay, heck, even the font are all part of the enchantment of the story. An e-reader would just lessen the experience. There are literary elements to the storythat conjure up musty old libraries and bookshops.   I have been a voracious reader and bibliophile for such a long time, that my imagination runs rampant with the details of a story. When I read, I see everything: faces, furniture, places, objects. I can construct the entire story in my mind, using only the author's words, and my imagination. With The Night Circus, t didn't work that way. I could see the general outline of things, get an impression, but the details were always hazy. I have an idea of what Celia Bowen looks like, but I could never attempt to describe her to anyone. I can just feel how she looks. The same goes for the Circus itself, it is more of a general feeling and atmosphere than it is a description. The other funny thing about that was that as soon as I left a character or a place, I would totally forget how they looked. I would have to reconstruct the circus in my mind every time I went back there. It was as if I was viewing everything through a mist or haze.   That is why it is so hard to write about this book. I can only tell you how I felt while reading it. As I was reading it, I felt magical, and I was so happy to be away from home, it helped me feel transported. The other thing that I abandoned in the reading was my discipline. I usually force myself to read slowly, so that I can savor each chapter, and live with each character for a long time. I like to walk around, thinking about what would happen next, and what the characters might be thinking. I wanted to do that with The Night Circus too, but each time I put the book down, an incredible melancholy crept over me. I felt listless and alone. I had to get back to the circus. I did most of the reading at night (happy coincidence, or fate?) in the old library of the hotel.   Too soon (actually, on time, the night before we left) I finished the book. I was beyond sad. I was not ready for the story to end. I was not ready to leave the circus. I wanted to email Bailey and tell him how marvelous his circus was. I didn't want to let go, it hurt too much. I was sad that I would bot be selling the book. I was sad that I had no one to talk to about the book. I was sad because I knew there should be no sequels or other journeys with the circus. It was the perfect story and did not need an adaptation for the screen. It does not need a sequel. It just needs to exist and find it's way into the hands of other readers.   I started looking on the web and found the author's website, facebook page, and pages for the book itself. There is a community out there, reveurs, like in the book itself. That both comforted me and irritated me. On one hand, having a community to discuss the book with would be lovely. On the other hand, I still feel like this is MY book, and I wanted to keep it that way for a little while longer. I wasn't ready to share this experience. I knew I would be writing a review of this book, how could I not? But even that frightened me. What if, in the process or writing it, I deconstructed it to the point it was no longer magical? Unlike Celia in her quest to control the circus, I did not wan to know how Marco's magic worked. It was better left a mystery.   That night, I dreamt of trains, passenger trains, everything was in shades of grey, save for a pair of bright red boots worn by a woman whose face I could not see. When I woke, I realized that, although I was done with the book for now, the book was not done with me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this games was really fun (: I like how you can play a ton of different games on one app that's free
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is really helpful, when I'm onthe go i can just look at this and know whet outfit to wear :) perfect
B003XKNWVI|1.0|I downloaded the sample chapter of this e-book, and immediately noticed two things. First, it's not properly using the Kindle \\"table of contents\\" feature. While there is a page near the front of the book that says \\"Table of Contents\\" on top and has links to the contents of the book, if you load up the Kindle's \\"Go to...\\" feature the \\"table of contents\\" button is grayed out, so they must not have tagged their table of contents page correctly.<br /><br />Secondly, and much more importantly, there are no line breaks after the individual lines of dialogue in the play. Shakespeare's plays are mostly composed in iambic pentameter, and these iambic pentameter sections are almost always printed like poetry, with a line break after each \\"line\\" of five iambic feet, so that you can discern the meter more easily. In the sample chapter of this book, there are no such line breaks, and all the dialogue runs together into paragraphs. Having the line breaks in the right place is one of the baseline requirements for an edition of Shakespeare, so I give this one star.<br /><br />If the publisher revises the book to correct these two features, then it'll be worth taking a second look at this edition. Otherwise, avoid it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome and very addicting!! They should add more games it would be more fun. Most games arr very entertaining and good to play to waste time.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Now I don't have to worry when I forget to send documents to work.  One click and my home desktop is right there.  Great!!

B004V5QWU2|5.0|Works fantastic in my Kindle FIRE! Everything downloaded perfectly. So much better than a high priced unit that takes up space on the dresser. I can take this anywhere...even WORK!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app and for free :D Now I don't have to transfer videos to my kindle, I can stream them.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book wasn't as good as the first but still better than the last. Recommended read, quick read.  It becomes a little repetitive but still better than 80% of my reads
B0054JZC6E|5.0|l really just love it because it is so fun 'cause I can look for new games every day .it is so awesome!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was very excited to begin this book and it seemed to drag on too long.  It became completely unrealistic however I am probably being too harsh.  I had high expectations based upon the first two in the series but would still recommend
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games had been recommended quite anew times and my only frustration was that I didn't read it sooner.  Highly recommend it and the series. Then go see the movie.  I think it's the best movie from book that I have seen, besides the notebook.
B005HIEFC4|4.0|This was a funny feel-good Romantic Comedy.  No surprises, but it kept me entertained.  Great chemistry between JT and Mila Kunis.  I really like both of them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app that has so many reading plans and helps keep you on track.  I love my quiet time with God and reading His word with my one year reading plan each day!

B002I0J5FG|5.0|It's so good to play Shadow of the Colossus again. The game looks amazing and plays just like I remember. I was also excited to play ICO since I never got the chance to back in the day. So far I am really impressed with the game. I don't really have any complaints about it so far. This is definitely worth buying.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have found this app to work well with the Kindle Fire, smart phone and Pc.  Loading docs and pics on one device is quick and then having access on all is so convenient.
B005E7AOHI|2.0|diehard primus fan. thought this was eh.   ...eight. nine. ten. eleven. twelve. thirteen. fourteen. fifteen. sixteen.  seventeen. eighteen. there. twenty.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Keeps my kids quiet when I am driving.  Keeps me entertained while waiting for soccer practice, etc., to finally be over.
B000GL1BHO|2.0|this item is way to small- a kid could very easily damage it. If it had been larger, I would reccomended it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is by far the most effective, powerful, intuitive, and fast remote PC solution I have used for Android devices. 5 stars.
B000H6H81Q|5.0|My little boy loves prehistoric animals. When I saw this wooly I knew he would be so happy to have it as an addition to his collection. I am happy to report the item is of great quality and very detailed. Happy buyer.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Nothing too exciting or fun, a bunch of thrown together games that will keep you busy for a few minutss
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good game in all, but they all kinds have the same movements and you have to unlock the games.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|This review is for the EXTENDED VERSION of the movie BIG, starring of course, Tom Hanks.  The original movie was very good to great, with some incredible lead acting. But the original always had some notable flaws related to character or story development.   Problems such as, why didn't the parents put forth significant effort for law enforcement to search for the missing child?  How is the neighbor best friend (only \\"six months older\\") have such extensive survival skills for maneuvering in the big city while the lead character has none?  How do the two youths know to go to Consumer Affairs to search for parks that might have a Zoltar machine in its possession?  Why doesn't the character Josh Baskins make a greater effort to contact his family?  Why does Billy get so mad at Josh after one solitary, insignificant snub?   How does Josh come to be adorned with such a garish tuxedo?  I will stop there to save some surprises for those who have never watched the Extended Version.  Suffice it to say, that the Extended Version should have been the THEATRICAL VERSION from the start... it is perfectly paced and answers all of the questions which modestly impede the original version.  I will never be able to watch the regular theatrical release again... the extended version is vastly superior. Now if only all of my favorite movies could be released in such a format.
B006C45MRE|3.0|The movie is entertaining even though its not believable, but what in hollyweird is? The main character is a manly man, looking all good in his western wear. Not too pretty and fights like a badass. The perfect man really. Anyway, the good guys, the bad guys, the indians, and the good alien all band together in the end to fight the aliens that are kidnapping ppl and stealing all the gold. There are no naked people or sex scenes and I dont think I even heard a curse word. Kinda refreshing. I wont buy it but Ill prolly watch it again sometime. I hope there is a sequel with cowboys and zombies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Overall its ok, but its not the most fun. I dont like how you have to beat a game to get points. Its ok but not the best
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app. There's a ghost on my PC lol. But on a serious note it makes .me even lazier
B000JQTWPO|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy reading a book written in the late 1800's.  I thought for sure the language would be difficult, etc.  But I was totally wrong.  I so completely enjoyed the read.  Social commentary doesn't ever really change....
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun and is perfect for kindle fire. I encourage you to download it. It is also free.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|This was a replacement for my daughter's previous HSM2 that had been worn out.  The new DVD works great and is exactly what we wanted.
