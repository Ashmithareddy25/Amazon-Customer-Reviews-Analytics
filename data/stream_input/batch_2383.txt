B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Very slow and I should have rented. Not worth the release price. Don't know what all the hype about this movie is for. Would have made a better documentary.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is a great mix of fun and serious. Really meaningful lyrics mixed with absolute craziness. One of my favorites right now. Seems to have a song for a lot of occasions. Really talented artists.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The book was a good read. Although few of the stuff were predictable it was interesting. It will be great to see this on screen.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I really am a &#34;Hobbit&#34; fan and as long as they produce one I'll be buying! BUT why do you put Blue Ray in with DVD? I can afford the DVD but to play the Blue Ray I'd have to upgrade to a $2,000.00 machine! Not on!
1400049628|5.0|I suggest that any body who likes zombies, buy this book it's good reading nothing to serious, a good book to read when you need you're zombie fix

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this series.  It is beautifully done. And you can't wait to see what happens next. I will be sorry to see this series end.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is the most colorful, sincere, heart-warming story I've read in a long time.  Thought-provoking but never heavy, it drew me in from the first page through the last.  I recommend it highly and now will see the movie.
B009PHRIKE|5.0|I just love these Original Album Series (although the early releases had a much sturdier housing for the CD's).  The only negative about these releases is there is no booklet or liner notes.  It's a no-frills release.  But having said that, you can get really great albums for cheap.  I'm a big fan of JLP's music from this era and I listened to all 5 of these CD's in two days.  Hopefully another release of later CD's will be released too.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The author wants to tell a good story, but this is clunky and wooden.  I finished it but will not read the next books in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the best game i have...........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />  from anine year old.............2013<br />p.s. it is the best game in the world...... it is AWESOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never imagined I'd like let alone be addicted to a show about zombies.....but I am.  i guess that goes to show how good it is.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I'm not a huge Bond fan but enjoy most of them.  I think Daniel Craig is vying for the best Bond of all time (verses Sean Connery of course).  I think Skyfall put new blood in the series.  Still like Casino Royal a little more.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|This review applies solely to the radio edit.<br /><br />Alright, so I think I've given this song enough tries where I believe I can give a fairly honest review. It's indeed a new move for Daft Punk, using much more vocals and natural instrumentation than before. For some, this works; for others, it may not.<br /><br />I've been hearing a lot of praise about this song, but also a lot lashing, and this review's primarily directed at those people. I feel that this album, not to mention the song, has been getting much overhype, especially in the weeks and days leading up to the announced single. There's been much more advertisement for this, much more than I recall seeing for their previous albums (though, if I can remember correctly, Discovery had a lot of news too), and that may be because of the proliferation from the Internet and the fact that the musicians are now signed with a much bigger label. Indeed, DP didn't have to worry too much about the scrutiny that comes from the Internet from earlier days.<br /><br />From leaks to edits to remixes, we've heard it all. And now, finally, we're given the first single from their upcoming album, first as a radio edit. This is a substantial departure from their earlier sound. And I have to say: I like it. I like it a lot.<br /><br />It seems that they're trying to revive disco, and it seems to work, all the while incorporating their signature sound as well. And, for the first time, the vocals seem to be more \\"natural\\" this time around; that is, less \\"digitized,\\" if you will. I admit, I was not enjoying the sound I first heard from Pharrell (despite the extremely catchy SNL ad), though the final version did sound better than the earlier leaks. I thought his voice didn't really add to the DP aesthetic, and the lyrics were very plain.<br />But DP isn't known for their arousing lyrics. They are masters at making the repetitive listenable, and when they do use actual lyrics it's not the worst. But after a few more listens of \\"Get Lucky,\\" I couldn't help but tap my feet in sync after a while. My co-worker, a big fan of Pharrell, instructed me that Pharrell is first and foremost a producer, a singer secondly.<br />Okay, that makes more sense.<br />But still--the lyrics? Surely he could've done better. And that's why I give this review 4 stars. The chorus is fantastic, and DP blows the rest of the song away when they approach the 2:20-ish mark. It is pure DP to the core. But the lyrics could've benefited from some fine-tuning.<br /><br />It is, in the end, a great hit, and I can't wait for the whole album.<br /><br />Now, I won't say I'm a \\"true\\" Daft Punk fan, because by saying so it makes me sound snobbish, not to mention exclusive in saying DP can't be enjoyed thoroughly by the younger and newer listeners. But I am a longtime fan. I was a wee lad when I first heard \\"Da Funk\\" as a single on Chicago's B96, and, when I had enough cash saved up, Homework was the first CD I ever bought.<br />And every new album that came out after I always compared it to Homework, and always was initially disappointed. But today I can tell you with confidence that Discovery is their best album to date, and Homework is a close second. I still have to get Human After All more tries, though I admit it's probably their \\"worst,\\" even though it's still pretty darn good. (For the record, Alive 2007 is my favorite, purely for the ecstasy of their mixes.)<br /><br />So let's all enjoy Daft Punk's brave move into the mesh of disco and electronica, the extreme talent of Nile Rodgers et al., and the album that is to come.t Lucky,\\" I couldn't help but tap my feet in sync after a while.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Just finished and my heart is beating 100 miles an hour.  Need to check the library for the third book right away so this will be short.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|at first I thought this game was awesome. The problem is that when you are in the 3rd puzzle in order to get the prizes to complete it you have to pay a dozed dollar. I have no dollars at all and I ain't buying any. Now I'm stuck with thousands of coins and hundreds of regular prizes without been able to advance. I wish you could trade coins for dollars or sell prizes for dollars too. Either way would make the game better.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Wouldn't it be great to live in a world like this. Awell thought out storyline and cast of characters, can't wait for the next movie in this saga.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I thought this game was a little large for a tablet.  It did hold my interest and became somewhat addictive about midway through.  It did have to be rebooted several times during play, but always restarted at exact point of shutdown.  Also, getting stuck a couple of times, I had to resort to a walkthrough to get me past a very tedious and precise input puzzle.  These were quickly overcome with a reference to the walkthrough.  I don't like to have to go to a resource to play, but this did require more thinking power and precision on the input.  I did also need to use the hink button a little more than usual to keep from getting run back and forth to find clues.  Overall, I liked this for the challenge which is what I want in this type of game play.  Thanks ! !
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story is interesting and engaging, but you really have to fight that the character aren't given time to develop and you have a feeling that they are behaving in nearly random outbursts.  There is also a feeling that the book didn't cross an editors desk: I saw the same phrase repeated in successive paragraphs in ways that made no sense.  Overall it feels very clumsy.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Best Batman animation I have seen.  I love the mature theme taken by Frank Miller.  He has given this story a realistic feel, by showing character vulnerabilities as well as genuine character portrayal.  Can't wait to watch the second half of the story.  A definite must see for if you enjoyed the Dark Knight trilogy.
1582701709|2.0|I read this book a couple years ago when I was about 19 or 20. Maybe JUST MAYBE, if you can actually find it in yourself to believe whats written in this book it could actually change your life. But I found this book to be SO ridiculous there is just noooo way I could believe it whole-heartedly which is necessary for it to \\"work.\\" This book is all about thinking positive things which in turn attracts positive things (via the universe) and I am all for that. Thinking positively undoubtedly will, if not anything else, at least make you feel better. Actually, come to think of it I did not finish this book now that I remember correctly. When I read the part where the author claims you can eat absolutely whatever you want and never exercise and still have the perfect body you want just by thinking about it, I couldn't go on wasting my time with this nonsense.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Nice movie, well written and executed in the same fashion as part 1.  Loved the raw character portrayals that continued the Dark Knight trilogy.  Highly recommend this movie,
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Overall it's a great show. There is a little cheesy dialogue that you would expect from the CW but that can be overlooked with the great overarching story, the flashbacks to the island, and the normally good action involving the weekly villain.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Briefly, it's the story of an ex-CIA agent who has resigned to fill the role of mom when her husband's career causes them to relocate to Europe. The touches of everyday life interspersed with investigative details held my interest to the end.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Vikings is an interesting show that depicts Viking life during the dark ages.  You will be raping and pillaging with Vikings from the comfort of your own home.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The product is a replacement cable for my wife's kindle. It is as advertised and works fine. My only question was, why did it take 3 weeks to get this item, then when it arrived yesterday I see that it is postmarked from China. Now I know! I had no idea it would take this long as most item I have ordered from Amazon arrive in less than a week. Anyway, aside from me having to be patient, this transaction was fine.  James E. Peace
B000FC12SM|5.0|An awesome and informative read that explains so much you never knew!! If you want to have a better understanding of the other side this if THE book, no joke!
B004742Y68|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite supernatural movies. The movie was made during a time when it was okay to put weed-smoking parents in movies.  I so love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I highly recommend this series, it just envelops you in the time and life of everyone involved.  Can't wait for the next one
0345525558|4.0|First I liked this book which tells the tale of Victoria who survives the foster care system and makes a life for herself. Of course, there are many lurches, mistakes, and failures on the part of several parties involved.  The story is told using the technique of varying the time period with alternating chapters.  There is a present day chapter and then a back story chapter about Victoria's childhood.  I prefer stories told in a linear fashion and I'm not a fan of this literary technique.  Therefore, I downgraded the book because it used this format.  Additionally, events occur which seem incredulous and unreasonable.  I don't think they are necessarily realistic.  Firstly, when a  blond blue eyed caucasion girl is abandoned at three weeks, there are 10 qualified couples waiting to adopt such a child.  Typically, the courts terminate the parental rights of the parents of an abandoned newborn after a reasonable attempt is made to identify the parents.  Usually, the court will appoint a lawyer who will protect the parent's rights, and a termination of the  parental rights hearing will proceed forthwith. So an abandoned white baby in foster care since birth under these conditions is not realistic.  Next, (spoiler alert) Elizabeth's last minute refusal to go through with the long awaited adoption proceeding struck  me as odd.  She knew how destructive such a disappointment would be to her foster child.  She is portrayed as a sensitive loving foster mother, and this was completely out of character.  Her reason for delaying or for refusing to through with the adoption did not make sense.  Victoria's desperation and sense of betrayal following this terrible disappointment is realistic and understandable.  I am not sure I understand what she hoped to accomplish (spoiler alert) by setting the grape vines on fire.  Further, I do not understand why Victoria (spoiler alert) would tell her case worker that the bruises she sustained during and after the fire were an unjustified beating.  In part I understand that she wanted to hurt Elizabeth as Elizabeth hurt her.  Further, she did not feel she could return to live with Elizabeth after she destroyed her property even tho her conscious reason for setting the fire was not to hurt Elizabeth. Therefore, she accused Elizabeth of dislocating her shoulder and beating her without reason. In fact, the dislocation and bruises occurred because Elizabeth was trying to save Victoria from the fire, and Victoria would not cooperate.  She had to pull her and fight with her to remove her from harm's way.  Even so she was on the burn unit at the hospital for a month.  The free fall foster children feel when they age out of care is realistic.  I am sure many are homeless and jobless.  We need a system in our society to better transition these children.  We should also assure them that if they are college material, college and their living expenses will be paid for by the state.  The same should be true for vocational training and job placement.  Still, once Victoria found a job for which she had a special talent and which she loved, she should have stayed with the job.  However, (spoiler alert) she becomes pregnant by a man whom she loves and who loves her and instead of making a home with him she chooses homelessness while she is pregnant.  Alternatively, she could have continued working and living as she was.  Becoming homeless so the father could not find her seemed extreme.  She had a good reputation and experience in the floral business.  There was no reason she could not have found another job and a place to live.  Living in the park and her car seemed unrealistic.  Further, that she chose to have no medical care and give birth at home in her apartment alone also didn't make sense.  There are numerous free services including WIC which would have given her free care and nutritional support while she was pregnant.  She could have delivered her baby in the hospital.  Her boss at the flower shop, Renata, had a mother who was a midwife.  Victoria knew and liked Mother Ruby, the midwife.  At the last minute she uses the midwife.  There is no birth certificate and she never chooses a name for her infant daughter.  I will not tell you how this story ends.  Needless to say there is a great deal of drama here.  It could make a good movie.  Some of it however, is incredulous.  I did enjoy this book and recommend it. It has spurred me to look at a floral dictionary with the Victorian meanings assigned to each flower.
B003GXJ072|5.0|It's a classic sci fi masterpiece. It spawned sequels and spin offs what more can I say. The funny thing about older movies showing the future is their tech predictions my laptop is more advanced looking than the mother computer
B004MPEVWC|5.0|I Love these kind of movies and watch them when I have time and very happy to find them at Amazon
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The actors did so well of bringing the mystery and strangeness to the screen that I think fits Doctor Who so well.  After watching my first two-part episode I was hooked and started watching all the seasons in order.  Great season with many great episodes! RUN!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is so lucky to have her dreams come true. She was in the right place at the right time.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Was a good second book in this series. I liked the story, the characters, and the overall vibe of the book. Read this book in 2 days and now I am not so patiently waiting for the third book to come out.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I don't usually like &#34;real life books&#34;, but this one is written so well.  It reads like a wonderfully crafted story.  Then you remember it's real.  I have lots of respect for the author and you really grow to love her and will her on.  I printed a copy of a map of the PCT to refer to as I was reading. I had the kindle version.<br />Highly recommend.
B00846REIS|5.0|When I fist got this book I wasn't sure what I would think. It sounded like it would be another 50 shades copy cat. Don't get me wrong the stories are very similar to one another ( virgin girl, corrupted guy, etc). Surprisingly, this book held its own. Right away I was drawn into the story, and found myself unable to put the book down.<br /><br />If you liked 50 Shades you will like this!
B0081336FO|5.0|while American television can produce quality shows, the Brits are consistently able to show us how it should be done-masterfully!<br />This series is another of the caliber of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; .The actors, writers, directors,and it would seem everyone involved in these productions are perfect in their roles. The combined efforts of this talent give the audience a gift of wit,and taste, while reminding one quality is not dependent on advertising content every 5 minutes
B0002C4JE4|5.0|I loved this cd so much that this is the second one I bought. My old cd was scratched and I missed listening to all those marvelous songs. I was so happy to get another and have listened to it nearly every day since getting it in the mail. The cd was in new condition and arrived in. timely fashion.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|It takes a good writer to weave together six separate stories spanning many centuries and keep the reader interested in all of them. David Mitchell does this and more. Each story is connected, but that connection is never overt and interpretation of that connection is very much up to the reader. As each story wrapped up, I found myself asking questions, wanting to know more, intrigued by each tale. The characters are richly drawn, and portrayed warts and all. Above all, I found Cloud Atlas to be an intriguing exploration of humanity. It questions values, past, present and future, and proposes paths that the human race might well take, given our current trajectory. Yet, he interjects hope and bravery amongst brutality and callousness. I highly recommend Cloud Atlas for its beautiful prose, engaging characters, vividly imaginative stories and its unique questioning of humanity and morality.
0802473156|5.0|I read this for the first time as a teenager and it changed my life.  If you want to read one book other than the Bible that will transform your outlook on relationships, this is the book.  I have given it to friends, and will ask anyone who is serious about understanding love to read it.
B000FA675C|4.0|I read this book because I was told it was good. I found it slow to start.<br />But once you get into it, it was worth  it. Yes very good
B00B3MN65K|5.0|This is one of those albums you can play over and over and over again. This is great music!!I cannot wait for the next album...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Calculator Plus Free is good because it is LARGE PRINT! Finally, a calculator I can see. It does the basic functions - nothing fancy, but I don't need extras of this to figure grades & balance the check book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolute loved this book! It had action, mystery's, adventures, romance, and a long list of more. Before I started reading this series I didn't like to read at all. But if I can find more books like this one, I think I would be reading all day. I would recommend this book to anyone, but best if over the age of ten.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond Dash could be addicting, but that would cost money. It's challenging, but the levels are attainable - even without the &#34;extras.&#34;  If you run out of lives, you can wait and more will come. It's a game to just relax. The music intensifies the action of getting those 3 diamonds at a time!.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You was a great second book in the series.  I CANNOT wait for the third.<br />Great character development.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I pair this with my ATH-m50s, Klipsch Image S4s, and my Bose Companion IIs. I'm not by any means an audiophile and not all my songs are in 320kbps mp3 (at the least), or even FLAC, however these do provide a noticeable boost to audio quality. I'm not sure how apparent it will be on devices such as the Nexus 4, Galaxy S3 as the sound seems to be quite good already in output (via headphones) but when paired with my laptop and comparing to the quality before and after the sound is bounds apart.<br /><br />If you're wondering my Laptop is an HP Pavilion dv6 variety. I find that this DAC is especially necessary for larger headsets like the m50s helping to give it that &#34;oomph&#34; they need, that is some are quite a bit too quite without them and not to mention help to flourish the true nature of excellent earphones, audio playback devices, and the high-quality songs.<br /><br />These especially help the sharpness and clarity of the bass when they may usually sound muddier and the highs are quite clear too. Helping to distinguish great range of guitar and some of the drums.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I had read these books prior to viewing movie so I knew the storyline. I felt this was a good depiction of the first of the books. It was well acted and I can see why Jennifer Lawrence is now getting so much attention.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|i never listened to either one of these guys before but this is an excellent collaberation.  this is a very good blues album that sounds like it came straight out of the hey day of the blues.

B00B69UQJY|5.0|This album is one of their best. I have loved Depeche from the very beginning and I am so glad they keep making such great music. Martin is a lyrical genius, and David's experiences and tone translate into soul rushing music. <3

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is seriously one of my idols.  I am by no means as funny, but I have the occasional off the cuff remark...  It was really cool to read her insight about starting out and getting to where she was today.  I am planning on a career int eh film/tv industry and it was great to see such a candid view of it.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|It is always great to see a movie that portrays someone overcoming adversity.  It is also great to see a film about someone who dedicates their time and effort to help others accomplish great things. This film definitely gets two thumbs up.

B009ICQ6KO|3.0|this should have been a lot better but CM is getting old and probably was more motivated by the check than the creative challenge
B00005R62N|5.0|I remember when I purchased the album for the first time. It was only available on cassette at the time, mid 80's. I was blown away again when I heard it on CD. The \\"Metal God\\" sounds great way back then and even better on the newer stuff. With that said this CD really takes me back to a much more carefree time of my life.

B009LMTDL0|2.0|Sandberg writes in a breezy style, but leaves one feeling that the research, stats, proofs are well below the surface.  Her own feelings of insecurity about success and failure do not provide enough gravitas to address the subject of women and the leadership gap.  She fails to acknowledge that true leadership comes in many forms.  Tell us some stories about how women have led over the years that are inspirational.  Talk about companies that women have started that reflect their broader leadership style. For goodness sake stop it with the classes you took in college where you were afraid of not getting an A.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is written for young adults.  I am a pretty old adult, and I thought it was wonderful.  It is a story about a very sad situation without being the least bit sappy.  There is a reason there are 1 million copies in print.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|This was my first Taylor Swift CD that I have purchased.  I love the entire CD.  I can relate to so many of the songs...  great way to let out feelings.  Great for being happy, sad, in love, broken hearted...  it covers everything... but mainly everything I can relate to as a single female looking for a great guy to reciprocate my love.  Well done, Taylor.
B0072M9PM8|3.0|I love the Cult but this is not my favorite album. In fact I put it 2nd to last. But hey at least they are still making music so I hope the next album is better
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is the best of Kelly Clarkson... no need to purchase all of the CDs to get your favorites...  Great music, self-empowering....Also, I love that a Christmas Song is at the end of the CD!  Perfect!
B00328G4Y8|5.0|500 years from now people will still be listening to Beethoven and Hendrix. I hope Im still here. Damn I'll be ooooold then.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|uhhh have you ever used a knife and thought how much better would it perform if it were sharp? Problem solved. How about those great looking knives that perform below perceived levels of getting it done...sharpen that bad boy up and get to cuttin!
B003MVJG8Q|5.0|I downloaded the drivers with power based on previous comments from their website, it works as expected.  It seems the bottleneck is external hard disk now.
0061733199|5.0|So this book is one of those books that when the power goes out and the wireless no longer works and you need to figure out how to get that really important stuff done...yeah this is it. Buy it, keep it, refer to it, browse it, you will always come across something that may win a random trivia quiz one day, or save your life. Great resource book and random knowledge reading you can apply if needed.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|We have all of Madeleine's earlier recordings which are superb.  This is a pleasant diversion but I look forward to more of her original style.  If you want her at her best, purchase &#34;Careless Love&#34; and &#34;Half the Perfect World&#34;.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Only show I watch. Although I hope season 4 goes back to zombies and not so much human drama. Still better than anything else on tv.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I came to know the White Stripes just before their breakup.  I just can't get enough of this genius.  This is a fantastic album and you don't need to be afraid of playing it in front of your kids.
B0085Z3AMW|4.0|of course you have to purchase one of the halloween classics on blu ray to get the best sound quality and video. meets my expectations.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I kept on thinking the entire time &#34;man our country is messed up right now&#34;  I country had a lot of problems back then as well.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This is winning a Grammy, hands down. One of the best songs of the year.  If the rest of the album compares, then they truly have ascended time and space like Pharrell said.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|You just got to listen to this album, u can see they have evolved as a band plus if u have part 1 and 2 cds you can make a house with the cases
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is one of the BEST cd's I have heard in many years...I can't stop listening to it !!!  It has such great energy, it is addictive.  Hauntingly, I can't get it out of my mind...I want to share it with everyone, but I don't... I feel like it's too personal to explain, so I just turn it up LOUD & let my soul soak up all the energy...over and over !!<br />I loved their first cd, but this one is even better...a rare jewel in the clutter of the music industry of today!!!
B0044KBQLE|5.0|Season 4 & 5 were my favorites... but though this season started slow (how do you beat stopping the apocalypse?) The emotional journey that Dean and Cas go through...and eventially Sam was a great addition to the Winchester Brothers' saga. Mixing in Crowley and more fatherly help from Bobby just enhanced things. The new monsters and mystery problems made for lots of surprises.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Wasn't  too  sure about this movie when it first started , didn't get what was going on but as it progressed it just got better , very good movie and enjoyed watching on my Kindle Fire , clear viewing and good sound , get it and watch you'll like this movie
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a super fun game and challenging.<br />The colors are great and the pace is perfect to keep playing.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I only order movies that are worth showing to others! This rates as a thriller, teaching film, and one heavy on blood and guts!! It will definely NOT bore you!!! Not for young children. But great for teens and up. I have a list of films I consider, &#34;above&#34; the usual,this is one!!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Bought this based on TheVerge.com's review. Excellent material and feel. Good control for writing or doodling. I love the thickness of the stylus. I feel it helps with control and how you would use a stylus on a tablet. (Kind of like using a dry erase marker on a white board)
B003B96AOW|4.0|This is the definition of badass. Loading with accessories including a rifle, 2 handguns, 2 katanas and 2 sais. It is also huge I wouldn't recommend putting this guy in a display with other marvel figure he's more pf a solo display kinda figure. The base this guy comes with is amazing the brick wall is highly detailed with bullet holes and the floor has bullets and even if you don't use it as a stand it makes a nice display. The articulation isn't the best but it makes up for it in size accessories and the base. The sculpt is nice but not overly detailed. Overall this figure is badass the weapons and the base but lacks articulation. But that fact is forgotten in the awesomeness.<br /><br />For a more in depth review here is my video review: [...]
B006WWTKQ0|5.0|First Class movie in 3d for all ages, definitely one to check out for the family, I am 64 and enjoyed it, so now starting to build a 3D movie collection.
1439199388|5.0|Moises knows his stuff. Very interesting information. I think everyone should read this book. We have created our own illness.
B00475BUVM|5.0|Really good 3D movie, special effects are really great and make it a very worthwhile movie to watch, think I will get the follow up Wrath of the Titans and add it to my new collection of 3D movies.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Fantastic dvds.  Owning these dvds is so much better than renting them.  If you are going to follow the series, I strongly recommend purchasing each season as it becomes available.  That way, you can go back an refresh  your memory.  Can't  wait to get Season 2.
B006H5120E|4.0|3d is great, enjoyed the movie very much, it is on 2 discs which I don't really care for, but over all enjoyed it.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|I watched the original Horizon programme on BBC and this pretty much covers all of that.  There are some useful little bits in it though.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|One you've got to see to appreciate the 3D of this movie, original 2D was brilliant this takes it up a couple of gears.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I was not expecting much from an i3 processor, but I was surprised by how well this little box performs.  I used 8GB of ram and 256GB mSSD.  Using Windows 7, I can boot in about 15 seconds.  The windows experience score is 5.4, the on board video is what is bringing it down(otherwise everything else was 6.4 or above).  I used it with a 40&#34; Samsung LCD and it worked great.  I did hardwired it to my network, so I cannot speak about wireless and heat.  For a fast little home theater streaming box, it really fit the bill.
B000VDDDVO|1.0|It's a Wonderful Life was a wonderful movie, watched this movie with a good friend whom had never seen the movie and she thoroughly loved it too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good read.  Saw the movie also.  Sparks kept up with the story line and kept the reader interested.  I enjoyed this book.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|as card games go, this is a great game so far... nice Gui, learning curve isn't bad.  just wish the items didn't cost so much.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is more than just a hidden puzzle game. It requires strategies and cunning to excel at it. This game is worth the time to download and okay.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|A must read for the thinking person or one who thinks they are. A very enjoyable exposure of the \\"science\\" of science.
B0042GNDT8|5.0|When you look into Strauss, Fritz Reiner was a name to be reckoned with. Experts and enthusiasts alike have always agreed on this.<br />These recordings are very old, late 1950s vintage. I'm not going to fool you by saying they sound fantastic. If you come to them from one of the Strauss albums from more recent technology, they sound old. But if you listen to them first on any day, before any more recent recordings, they will sound excellent. It is the comparisons with better technology that shows up their limitations. In their own day, people thought them remarkable - by comparison with mono recordings!<br />As performances, they have never been bettered. Sure, there is massive competition. But Strauss can take many kinds of treatment, and these are dead pan. None of the subtleties of Beecham or Karajan or Kempe. But this straightforward approach has virtues. Strauss the orchestrator wrote all his own \\"sound effects\\". You just have to play them the right way! And by golly, Reiner knew how to do it.<br />The bloodcurdling shreaks and sheer viciousness of orchestral playing in the Salome and Elektra excerpts is quite hair-raising - something to top Solti's recording! - and Borkh is in glorious voice. The Don Juan is, in my assessment, the finest (inter pares) ever put on disk. Janigro and Reiner co-operate on a Quixote that has real character. Heldenleben is of course a different story: mock-nobility, pastoso grandeur, but what a feast of orchestral colours! Ditto for Zara. The Chicago Symphony have a field day, and so can you.<br />Not all of the contents of this box are of the highest quality. That would be too much to ask. But Reiner never gave a mediocre performance. That's his redeeming merit in such trifles as the Burleske and the Burger as Edelmann pastiche. The Domestica is not my favourite anyway, but it as well played here as most of the top-billed recordings since.<br />I guess the point to bear in mind foremostly is this: That Reiner heeded Strauss' injunction never to exaggerate. Strauss said once: Don't even look at the brass, you'll only encourage them to play too loud! But they are a magnificent presence throughout - without ever sounding exaggerated. I suppose the word \\"honesty\\" applies here. How Reiner achieved maximum excitement from a basically \\"normal\\" and \\"sane\\" pulse, will forever remain his secret.<br />So: Not a lot of glitz and glamour, but plenty of meat. Lasting values, as they used to say when people still strove for lasting values!<br />This box would be worth having at almost any price! With the price tag as it stands, you would be fool to pass up the chance to acquire one of the truly great legacies from the classic era of recording.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this show, some of the best television I have ever watched. Can't wait to watch season 3 which I do own but just haven't had the time it deserves to watch it yet.<br /><br />Carol F.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|TAYLOR SWIFT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES SINGERS AND ALSO LOVE THAT SHE LOVES THE COLOR RED.....WHICH IS ALSO ONE OF MY FAVORITE COLORS....I BOUGHT HER KEDS SNEAKERS WITH THE RED ON THEM
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game to keep me busy while I have to wait for somebody, something, airport, train station, doctor's office, or at home during TV commercials!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I read this story before - enjoyed it a second time!  Love anything written by Ken Follett - he has a way of keeping you glued to the story!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game gets a little old after so long with no sceen changes the further you go there is just more trains and sometime no way to pass a sertain point but its fun. Love the fact that they have missions to complete makes you keep playing so you can complete them.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I've been using this little tool to transfer my old cassettes to digital format and it is running like a dream.  Had to get the wheels turning manually at first but it has been going great ever since.  So far have transferred around a hundred hours of audio and no signs of problems at all.  I do recommend using the free software from the Audacity website instead of the copy received with the tape player because the online version is more up to date and works better with newer computers.  Packaging and delivery were great as well.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this game for my littlest one who loves ponys although it takes for ever for us to get the caracters she likes because she always spend the jewel on things she dose not mean to. wish it had a way to look the jewels so you could save them. Its fun to have the interaction of gameloft and with out conection no on can talk to any one with makes it safer.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|...because it didn't keep me glued to the pages like Kathy Reichs typical Temperance Brennan books.  It was good, but not the expected &#34;Great!&#34; I'm used to.  Something very surprising needs to happen to bring back whatever chemistry that seems to be &#34;slipping away&#34; in this series.  A new character?  A different love interest? A trainee or intern?... something!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great solitaire app.  Along with the settings you can change and the card backs, it also has an online type of competition to see who can get the draw settled the quickest ans with the fewest moves.  Not only do I play the game, I always try to beat my time. (The Times logged as the top seem impossible)  I also try to see if I can do it in under 100 moves.  I am not sure it is possible, but I have come pretty damned close.  A must have for those solitaire fans.
B00BJS7104|1.0|The plot was weak and the movie itself was a praise and worship session for nothing but violence and vengance.  Slavery was an abhorrent institution and how slaves were treated were an abomination.  This movie is an abomination.  I am sorry I bought it and watched.  More hollywood trash!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Game is easy to play, quick response time, clear display, and offers different levels of play. I would recommend this game.
B00000IOSU|4.0|I bought this CD for the live version of '' i will remember you'' which i had wanted to get for a long time. i love that song and i am a fan of sarah Mclachlan and if you are looking for a live version of her songs or maybe what is is like to watch or hear her in person this will give you an idea. i also became a fan of a few songs that i didnt know about before this CD. the final Song ''Angel'' is a perfect way to end the album and it is a heartbreaking song and one that a lot of us can relate to. i love songs and music that i can relate to and ''feel'' as i listen to it. it gave me goosebumps when i first heard it. if your a fan of sarah Mclachlan you should buy this.
B009S33I68|4.0|General Moore is a wonderful Army General and combat commander.  His written description is honest and should be read by every American.  Every citizen needs to be aware of the price paid by our military personnel in the Viet Nam War.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not since Master and Commander have I encountered such a wonderful world of characters and situations. Master and Commander lasted thousands of pages. I hope this series eventually is the same.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love hidden object games and this one is no different! This game is super fun and some people are incorrectly saying that you have to pay to continue with the game. This is only if you are too lazy to work to earn coins and such. I am on level 57 and I cannot get enough of this game!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Makes you realize that things are not always what they seem on the surface.  We should be more aware of what's going on around us.  Ask &#34;why&#34; more often.  Get to the real root cause of a problem or situation.  Good lessons can be learned in an interesting way.  Good reading for teenagers in preparation for life.
B008M7JODC|5.0|It is like the new and more exciting X-Files very good show, keeps you wondering every episode. Strong back story but does not come to light until.you watch the season
B00C6TUXN2|4.0|This is a pretty smoothe, easy going album from Willie. He went way back to the 30s to enlist some of the songs on this album. He took the songs and put his own spin on them to create an album that is nice to just sit around and enjoy. It doesn't have any fast paced, honky tonk songs but it does contain some fine guitar work , piano solos, and harmonica playing. Who else but Willie could take an Irving Berlin song and make it country. It's a nice listen for any true Willie Nelson Fan.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great trilogy. Very well written.  I found myself wanting so badly to keep reading.  Feeling Katnisses emotions.  All in all, these books are pretty dark and gory, but I think one thing that carries on as a theme through all of them is hope!
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Very interesting and delightful story especially for someone who lived in Devon and could visualize the areas he was walking through!
B005N1OUSE|4.0|The title caught my eye and intrigued me. However, I was not prepared for what I found inside the covers. Dan has opened up a whole new way of communicating ideas for me. Even though I work with conveying ideas visually every day, this book gave me an entirely different way of thinking about communicating with pictures.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is a awesome movie. it is action packed from start to finish. i just love this movie. i think karl urban is a great dredd if they do another movie i hope they keep him. i thought that the actress who played ma-ma was good. i just thought that ma-ma was going to be a better villian than she was. is this the sequel to the original or a remake/rebot if it is a remake/rebot. i'm not going to lie i do like the original alot better. but this one is awesome too. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|Ok so I was almost the great white shark and I needed 2000 more coins to unlock it and then the last time I got on it the totally reset the whole thing:( it made me so frusterated because I was so excited to get the great white and then it restarted the game.  this was a really fun game until that though and I ended up just deleting it from my kindle fire. If hungry shark didn't do whatever it just did I would've rated it 5 stars.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The twists in this story made it so exciting that I didn't want to put it down.  I was very impressed.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|I really enjoy this CD--very fine musician. Hope he will have more classical music CDs!  Does he have concert tours in the U.S.?
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This movie made me want to go visit Paris and where it all took place.  It was sad and very touching.  I enjoyed the movie and the book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game doesn't only just have great photography but it also spices things up a bit so you never get old of this game... u get New scenes and even some actor do nd to the season. Or holiday! Subway surfers is decimate YES!!!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|DVDs arrived promptly, in good condition and I only had a little issue with the intro of an episode in the 3rd season; it skips a little but, besides that, the items are good. It was a good purchase.
B00AEBBADG|4.0|It is a classic movie that everyone must see.  It is about a dystopian society in which gangs fight for their \\"innocence\\"
B001FVV2X2|4.0|This is not the best season of this show, but by the end it gets really interesting.  Some of the episodes seem like filler, but you really get to know the characters & they are my favorite part of the show.  It's weird, spooky, & funny.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Marian Keyes always offers a funny and relaxed read.  This was one.  sometimes after reading a heavy detailed book a book like this is great to refresh the brain ready to tackle harder reads.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Gives me more Percy Jackson and I love it. The series follows the heroes on my many journeys which are exciting to read
B0050KEVO6|4.0|Alchemy makes you think about chemistry class, but without the grades! Gets your brain going trying to figure out what will mix with something else.  There are a few funny surprises throughout!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Anybody who has loved Depeche Mode throughout the years is not going to be let down by this new album. The perfect adjustment to the old Mode with a newer, edgier hints of dub and industrialized sounds. A must have for any collection of music.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|There is no denying the simple charm of this game.  I've had it for about an hour, and I have squealed and giggled with delight more times than I would care to admit.  It has absolutely captured the simple innocence of Ponyville and the bright, colorful world of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.<br /><br />The aspects of building shops and assigning ponies to work in them for bits (and to skip building times and waiting times for ponies to be ready to play games by spending gems, which can be purchased with real-world money) is very reminiscent of Zynga's popular Farmville game, but is that necessarily a bad thing?  This particular briny doesn't think so.<br /><br />Another huge bonus this game gets is the voice acting, done in-house by DHX in Vancouver, which means that every pony encountered sounds exactly the way they do on the show.  The art style is at the same time adorable and quite pretty, and instrumental versions of songs heard in the show play while you do and are a nice touch.<br /><br />The only reason this doesn't get full marks is the fact that some items and ponies can be quite expensive, practically forcing you to pay to play a \\"free-to-play\\" game.  Very un-Rariy-like - not very Generous, Gameloft!
B001VM0LAK|2.0|This movie is loosely based on the interestingly sprightly thriller Day of the Jackal from 1973; I say interestingly, because, not having read the book by Frederick Forsyth on which it was based, I understand nevertheless that it very faithfully followed the book; but it was not plodding. The faithful enumeration of the facts as laid out in the book seemed to build its own momentum and excitement; plus, you had Edward Fox as the title character, who was a winner.<br /><br />I think the producers of the newer &#34;version,&#34; if you might call it that, realized they just couldn't remake the original, which is a classic, so they didn't try ... exactly. Some moments from the original are replayed here with pretty much the same words, but, taken out of context,  they may fall pretty flat; I couldn't really tell because once the newer movie brought in the hero, everything seemed to fall pretty flat for me, largely because of his turn at doing an accent. I will give the producers points for trying to build in their own tension by turning the hunt for the Jackal into a personal duel with a former adversary, someone released from prison for the purpose, who has an Irish accent. Richard Gere and Brad Pitt have tried admirably in the past to master foreign accents, and Gere doesn't have that difficult of dialogue to make his attempt unbelievable; but for my money, if you want to have someone do a foreign accent, get DiCaprio, who is even better at it than Streep, imho.<br /><br />Essentially, if you are a shoot-'em-up fan who likes gore, you might like this one. Trying to best a theme from the original movie, the Jackal here goes through more hair color changes than if he had one of those revolving projectors that makes your Christmas tree change colors pointed at him; but less is more, in my opinion. In fact, the producers/director/writers were so conscious of not remaking the book that they didn't even mention Forsyth in the credits, simply saying they had based their new incarnation on the screenplay of the first movie. I found the political conflicts old hat and irrelevant; and when you find out who the target is, you're just going to hang your head in ho-hum-ness, at least I did. Not only is the target not someone of huge import ... well, maybe sometimes, especially today, 2013, but that person's popularity plays a big role and, I dunno, I'd have to re-see the newer movie, but I don't think getting all worked up about that person was justified in the plot. So, again, some people liked this version better, probably the ones who didn't like the old version. But when I saw the old version the other day, hence I had to see this newer one to see how it compared, I was blown away by how 1973 seemed almost as fresh today as it did then. That says to me that straightforward movie making sometimes just can't be beat.incarnation on the screenplay of the first movie.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|One of the most boring and badly written books I have ever read.<br />Wouldnt recommend this to anyone<br />The author of this should be taken out and flogged in public
B0041OT9W6|5.0|As a teenager, I loved reading this true story of a girl in hiding with her family and family friends during World War 2.What a wonderful and heartbreaking story.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|Wonderfully written first hand account of the end of the Pacific ground battles in World War II.  I got this book once I got placed out on Okinawa by the Navy in order to get some perspective on what this island has gone through.  This story blew my mind and absolutely gave me a deeper appreciation of the violence that took place just 70 years ago.  Highly recommended.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|What a great set.  I have been looking for the JP movies on Blu ray in a set and jumped on this the minute is went on the huge discount amazon had on it about a week ago.  The movies are beautiful on Bluray and the sound is as good if not better than I can remember from the theater.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Recommended by a friend and I loved it!  It was a great book.  Looking forward to Ernest Clines next book Armanda.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I cant fairly review this movie, it failed to keep me awake and entertained.  couldnt really tell you what the movie was about.

0307270807|4.0|An unusual, powerful and important book: part memoir, part revisionist history.  Herr himself calls it a novel (1992 interview with Eric Schroeder).  There is some stunningly good writing here.  The war reporter experienced the war, either directly or vicariously, in the same way as did the soldiers who fought it, and he ended by suffering the same madness as many of the soldiers who survived the fighting.  Herr managed to recover from PTSS only years later, through \\"an absolute commitment\\" to Tibetan Buddist discipline and practice (2000 interview with Ed Vulliamy published in The Guardian.uk)<br /><br />In 'Dispatches', Herr writes on two themes:  he writes about the war fully and honestly, and he writes about the wartime press corps in Vietnam, fully and honestly.  Herr was not really \\"a war correspondent\\", not in the way that phrase is usually understood.  He did have a press credential from Esquire, the men's fashion magazine, and that gave him a passport into the war zone.  Esquire printed a few of his stories but didn't complain when they stopped coming regularly.  Herr did not have the constraints, the editorial demands, the control by the news bureau, the deadlines, the obligatory reporting on the perceived 'important stories' as projected by the military high command.  Herr didn't need to show up at the official briefings in Saigon, and he usually didn't.  He had his own ideas about how to cover the war.  Herr was a free agent, in the best and the worst sense of that phrase.  The worst of it was that he paid the price for getting in too close to the war:  \\" I did go crazy,\\" he said to Ed Vulliamy.  \\"Within 18 months of coming back I was on the edge of a major breakdown.  It hit in 1971 and it was very serious.  Real despair for three or four years.\\"<br /><br />But the best part of being a free agent was that he learned the truth about the war in a way that was close to impossible for hamstrung news service reporters.  Example (p. 219): \\"On an afternoon shortly before the New Year, a special briefing was held in Saigon to announce the latest revisions in the hamlet-rating system of the Pacification program.  A lot of correspondents went, many because they had to, and I spent the time with a couple of photographers in one of the bars on Tu Do, talking to some soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division who had come down from their headquarters at Lai Khe for the day.  One of them was saying the Americans treated the Vietnamese like animals: '.. kill 'em and hurt 'em and beat on 'em so's we can train 'em.'  We knew he was telling the truth.  You only had to look at his face to see he really knew what he was talking about.  He wasn't judging it, I don't think he was even particularly upset about it, it was just something he'd observed.\\"<br /><br />\\"We mentioned it later to some people who'd been at the Pacification briefing, someone from The Times and someone from AP, and they both agreed that the kid from Big Red One had said more about the Hearts-and-Minds program than they'd heard in over an hour of statistics, but their bureaus couldn't use his story, they wanted Ambassador Komer's.  And they got it, and you got it.\\"<br /><br />That was us who got it, that was what we all got back in the US.  Anyone watching the nightly television news or reading the daily papers, that was the war news.  It never made much sense as I remember, and now I know why.  As I was reading Dispatches, realizing that Herr was in Vietnam only for 1967-68, I had a profound wish that he could be around to tell the story of the war all the way through, what he'd told already was more enlightening to me than anything I'd learned by studying press reports at the time.  I'd never heard it told like Herr told it  --  so simple and making so much sense.<br /><br />How Herr covered the war was by talking to the people doing the heavy lifting, the grunts, and by being where they were.  Talking to grunts wasn't like turning on a faucet, it took time, they hadto feel comfortable before they would talk in a meaningful way to an outsider, and fortunately Herr had the time.  He wasn't being harried by the home office as were the mainstream news media correspondents. Writing about the news bureau reporters: \\"There were a lot of correspondents who did their work, met their deadlines, filled the most preposterous assignments the best they could (but) conventional journalism could no more reveal this war than conventional firepower could win it, all it could do was take the most profound event of the American decade and turn it into a communications pudding, taking its most obvious, undeniable history and making it into a secret history.\\"<br /><br />As much as I admire this book, I gave it only 4 stars.  Wished I could have given 5. I agree with the professional critics, the book is the American equivalent of \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\".  But there is a serious weakness, I think, towards the end when Herr writes about his press corps buddies  --  some of that would have made a great ending to the book, but it gets out of hand.  More than 10 pages are devoted to Tim Page, a less than compelling character.  Although the question does arise, just how would one end a book like this?  Maybe it was simply a way of sparing the reader, as well as the writer  --  Herr says in the 1992 interview: \\"There are errors of fact in the book. I'm not happy about this. When the Khe Sahn piece was published [as an essay before the book], I had a really beautiful letter from a colonel who had been stationed there; he corrected me on various points of fact. I lost the letter, and it didn't turn up again until after the book was in print. I couldn't bear to go in and make the revisions myself. I was tapped out. I was exhausted from the project. I just couldn't do any more.\\"  Of course this is understandable, and forgiveable, but for the reader the irritating ending of Dispatches has the effect of blotting out, of rendering forgettable what hasgone before.  Hopefully it can be better edited in a future edition, something like what Antony Beevor did for Vasily Grossman's heroic war reporting on the  Eastern Front WW2.  Michael Herr's Dispatches is a book for the ages, and still ahead of its time.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It was slow moving at first.  But then it starts to pick up towards the end.  i didnt expect the ending.  Not one of the best horror films, but stil good.
0807014273|5.0|I read this for a course, and could not put it down. Gave me a better understanding of Jews living through World Was II.
B00BESLT6G|3.0|the first one was better. Very disappointing. Predictable and boring.  Should have rented something else.  Nothing like the first one.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|George was so underrated,  it hurts.  When you hear his songs sung, one after another, you realize how talented he was.  The finale makes you cry.  A great group of friends made this happen. A great tribute to a great man
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Cant get enough pf the Walking Dead.  Wished that it showed all year round.  It is very entertaining and captivating,
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Loved this book and would recommend it to many. Can't wait to see how well the movie was done and will definitely pick up another book by Nicholas Sparks!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a awesome game I had on my iphone and now I can get it on my new kindle! the only problem is the download. it takes for ever and I had to get rid of apps!but it is still worth it! every one should buy it now even if I costs money get it now you'll be up all night playing it!!! no lie I did it yesterday! fail
B004DLPXAO|5.0|good for all tablets.<br /> this app is for the people that have the tablet and no kindle.<br />Great books and able to download
B00B22IJXK|1.0|I uninstalled almost immediately after opening it... this is the most unimaginative editor I've come across. Very basic tools, definately not what is portrayed in the description. Not worth your time to download.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|its a good app not to tricky or complicate. if your not to into tech but like looking good in pic., this is your app.!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|\\"Great book! One of his best.  I think I am drinking more coffee now thanks to Reacher. Famous last words, should've had more ammo, or 'reloaded down stairs. Could not put it down, great read.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie is the best! Even if you weren't a fan of Lord of the Rings you will still love this movie!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|this is a great app. I did not use it yet but my friend has it it is the best calculator app out there
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this I am constantly playing it. I love how it always has things you can do you beverage bored with it
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Have seen several versions of Les Mes. Saw this in the theatre. Another classic-arrived with a bunch of other dvds and Bonhoeffer's book. Another smooth transaction. Thanks Amazon.
B009IF82SK|5.0|A co-worker asked me one day if I watched the Big Bang Theory. I said \\" Big Bang what?\\"<br /><br />So I tuned in a couple of episodes and found them to be spot on hilarious. After recording all I could find, exhausting every episode on Netflix and becoming frustrated as the episodes were random and out of order, I came to Amazon and bought the first 4 Seasons.<br /><br />I've subscribed ever since and highly recommend you do the same as these episodes are just as funny re-watched as they were the first time.<br /><br />You won't regret it.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|If you love Floyd, and you love spectacular quitar work, get this set.<br />First, the concert itself. The concert is incredible, with various Floyd hits, as well as the entirety of Gilmour's new album. Nobody misses a beat. The sound quality is incredible, as well as video. The one thing I did not like about it was during Echoes, the middle section where the squealing type-sounds occur is less audible. You can hear it, but not to the expectation I had. Besides that, this concert has nothing to hold against.<br />The second disc is special features, documentaries, extra live tracks, and a few music videos. This compililation of videos is incredible itself if you enjoy documentaries and such. It's very good, as well as funny at points. The extra live tracks sound incredible as well, same as the concert.<br />All in all, if you love Floyd, and you love quitar work, and one hell of a show, get this. The price is incredible for the content as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is the best show....A+++++ This is a must - love te british accents too.  There is still another season to go, just love it!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I never paid attention to Pink Floyd back in the day. I downed-loaded The Dark Side of The Moon because it was on sale for a great price and I have heard about it being good.  Some of my friends used to love Pink Floyd when I was a teenager, but I never really listened then.  One day recently I burned my down-loaded album onto a CD and listened to it on my Vincent Hybrid CD player, with Cardas Clear Light RCA interconnects, directly plugged into a Bryston headphone amplifier, with Grado PS-1000 headphones. I thought it sounded very good, but something was wrong. Then I burned another CD with no space between the numbered songs. Then it was perfect. I loved it. It comes across as one long wonderful composition; an act of love and creativity, with very talented musicians. I'm glad they remastered it and I took the time to really listen to it. I was using pretty good equipment. I really thought it sounded great. I recently heard Pink Floyd made a lot of money from that album. I think they deserved it. They made that album 40 years ago and it sounds like a classic to me. It is not your average rock album. It certainly stands out as a unique, creative piece. Albums this good don't happen very often. Thank you Pink Floyd.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained is one of the best movies EVER - Quentin is at his best and we really really have a lot of respect for him for approaching a difficult topic in a totally unconventional manner. He does not get lost in any of the usual \\"Uncle Tom\\" drama but displays biased individuals at their best and worst. Quentin is a genius and the actors - all of them - should get Oscar's not only for best performance but also for their bravery and determination to portray those characters. For the more technical aspects of the movie: great pictures, great sound, great choice of music and locations - this is a must buy!!!
0783230079|4.0|As I said I saw the movie on cable and enjoyed it so much I wanted to own my own copy. Thanks to Amazon for having the on line opportunity to purchase itl Everything I've purchased through Amazon and have received a used copy from dealers has been a great experience and everything has arrived as promised and in good condition.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|this can be used for many things including youtube pictures, pictures, and many more<br />I highly reccomend this app to people who like to create cool pics
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Beautiful album.  Great mix of songs just wish more were in English.  He has such a beautiful voice.  It is a pleasure to listen to.  I look forward to more.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Like this a lot. Easy to use.<br />Best free bible app out there. Great for following along in church. Great.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My 10 year old and I love Dr. Who.  We got the screwdrivers to send secret messages to each other but have been so busy checking to make sure that the dogs are not aliens we haven't even tried to write with it! Lots of fun! I think the price is a little high but we have had so much fun its worth it. I would definitely say this is a toy not high end collectors item but something fun to play with.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Just amazing!!!! This book have insightful information that really helps to understand and learn hoy to read the non verbal communications. It's a really useful guide
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Enjoyable book, but not a classic by any stretch.  Best if you love  video games and 80s trivia.  Strong first effort.
B004SIP9U6|3.0|This product was a good one. However, the case that the dvd came in does not shut properly or have a click when you close it. The case was in good condition and so was the dvd, but if there are going to be stresses in my life I don't want closing a dvd case to be one of them.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This is  a very great book for our times.  Many people have felt this. I recommend it to everyone ! My son told me about it. He is reading itself in prison.  I titled my review this way because about half way through it I got envious of the author because she's obviously got money.  But the journey is taken by all whether in exotic places, or inside the walls of prison. Basically the book is so universally human and spiritual, that I forgave her for having money, and myself for being jealous, and just enjoyed it
B009GED3HS|5.0|This season is as good as all the rest. I just wish the per show price wasn't $2.00. If you're watching the entire season, buy the pass
B00011D1OA|5.0|Love this movie. So glad I was able to get this in time for my mom to visit :) we both enjoyed it immensely...
B009VA1FN6|4.0|This is the first time I have read one of Kates books. I thought it was very well done. The story grabs you from the first page and keeps you turning them.I look forward to reading some of her other books.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I would really recommend  this book, if you like something different. I think you will like it. I surprisingly did.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the book and enjoyed watching the book come alive.  It was a novel story and the movie revealed it.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Harry Bosch has long been one of my favourites.  This book was good but didn't delve into Harry's complicated life like the other books.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Seeing the movie got me to pick up this saga and I'm loving it and hanging on every word..everyone in the book has a story and they all seem to cross in magical ways..could sit here all day telling u how much I love this so far but I'm off to read the 3  BOOK now.. :)
B008602KQI|5.0|So good. Can not wait to see the second installment I just hope it can keep up with how good the first movie was. I watched this with my daughter and we both gave it two thumbs up. Jennifer Lawrence was awsome as Katniss. It made me laugh and cry and finding myself cheering her on to Victory! All the cast played there parts so well. Woody Harrelson was terrific as her mentor you could feel the emotion in all the cast and portrayed there parts so well. I can't say enough about this movie except to watch it you won't be dissapointed.
0887081770|5.0|Beautiful book about the moon and what a father will do to make his daughter happy. The main problem of the book: I got a small size! I thought I bought the bigger version of it. But the story is still great and you can read it perfectly well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game! But there are a few thing it is missing like u can ride your horse/horses or breed. still it is a good game.
0062086529|5.0|My son is in love with this book since the first time I read it to him. It is a great book for three year olds!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a great modern take on Sherlock Holmes.  The modern take on his recovery from drug addiction was great (though I hope they can let it go now instead of letting the show go a la House) and so far the show does a pretty good job keeping things entertaining and not condescending to its audience.  I'm hooked!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|A light book and a very quickly finished, this we a different sort of book that my group usually reads. The plot is revealed in an engaging way, and the characters are quirky; the upbeat tone will make this popular with many people. Because it is told from the point of view of a man who experienced a mental breakdown, it has a child-like simplicity and uncomplicated tone. While not a  great work of literature, its diverting, pleasant and perhaps might even make people feel compassion for victims of depression or trauma.
0307887448|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I thought that it was mostly a nod to big-time gamer's of the 80's.  While I did grow up in the 80's and played some video games, I didn't consider myself a gamer.  My expectations were wrong.  Anyone can find this story engaging and exciting as long as they can except the premise that people of the future spend a great deal of time in a virtual world.  Everything else is simply an adventure of good against evil and David vs Goliath.  I highly recommend this book!
B0065GC0PG|5.0|But I read a review from someone with similar reading tastes as mine so I read the free chapters and was hooked.  I'm not a huge sci fi fan but I do enjoy dystopian fiction and this book fell somewhere in between with a splash of fairy tale tossed in for good measure.  Loved it!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|good movie, subject matter is sad though, glad it ended on a good note, probably will have a second one
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey's music is amazing and her violin skills are inspiring.  Beautiful blend of beats and just all around beautiful music.
B00633W614|5.0|They are set in historical times. The characters are interesting and the story moves quickly. Waiting for the next one that comes out in two weeks.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Hard to do but, they did it.  They made a very good movie from a very good book.  The acting, production values, directing are all top notch.  Looking forward to the second installment.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I find this game to be very fun and addicting...I like that it keeps collecting even when you are no longer playing the game..overall I'd say it's a very good use of your money.
B000VPPMXO|1.0|I ordered this virtual wall because I thought I needed a third one to make it easier to control where our Roomba was going while it cleaned the floor.  It was delivered on time but, when batteries were put in it didn't work.  I changed the batteries several times to be sure it wasn't the batteries but that didn't work.  It was a defective virtual wall.  I wanted to send it back and get a replacement but, the rules for this purchase were I had to send it back, get a refund, then reorder.<br />I have nothing agains't Roomba.  I am rating this product based on it's performance.  It didn't perform so, it gets one star.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is the Gen X woman's anthem. I burst into tears laughing! I love Tina Fey even more after reading this book. What took me so long? Oh, I know now, the husband, the girl, the gig, and the little voice in my head that says, &#34;stop tricking off!&#34;<br /><br />Great book for escapism. I loved every second of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update made this game sooo much better. I think it was released to soon because it wasnt near close enough to have a good steady gameplay but its still fun and I just love it so much.  People beware if you are looking for it to be the same as X-box and regular Minecraft its not but its fine because if you cant get those all this needs is more updates.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I do know for a fact that this would have been a fun game, so if you have anything but a kindle ,buy it. I tried twice to download it but it still wouldn't  work. I have been waiting over an hour and its only at ten percent. So if you are just looking for cool games like me. I pray that you don't buy it, Unless you have anything but a kindle.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The graphics are sweet and the story line rocks. It could be a little longer but this game was so good I cant wait for 5. The controls are a little hard to get used to but other wise it rocks.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was well written, kept reader engaged, and gives one much to think and talk about after finishing. All that you can want from a good book!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|You can beat a couple of worlds, but then you have to pay for extra worlds to beat the game.
B008220DGE|5.0|I am astonished at the deeply negative, shortsighted reviews for this movie.  This is Anderson's best work, a deep, ambiguous, elliptical, deeply mysterious movie that will be called a masterpiece in about 5-10 years, and will be considered one of the best (if not the best) film of 2012.  It has 2 amazing lead performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and has an excellent supporting performance by Amy Adams.  It has some of the most stunning cinematography I've seen recently (I was lucky enough to see this movie in a 70mm print).  The 70mm makes digital video look like crappy cell phone video.  Johnny Greenwood's music score compliments the film well, and the script is very good.  The whole film is given a dreamlike quality, which I really appreciated.  The Master leaves a lot of unanswered questions, which is why it is so deeply intriguing.<br /><br />Anyone who dislikes this movie needs to watch it again.  It gets better upon repeated viewings.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am not to sure in the day and time that one can do with Twitter.  Keep in touch with everyone/ or what is important in your life.  Keep it on an stay in-touch
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|So, I watched one show on TNT and I was hooked. I got caught up on all of the shows with Netflix and found the remaining ones on Amazon video and it's a great thing this Amazon video. Great picture and sound. The show is great, has a lot of humor in it that you have to pay attention to if you want to catch it.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I don't care for the elastic strap, it seems cheap.  In the world of all the snazzy ipad accessories surely we can come up with something a little more creative than an elastic strap.  Never-the-less, it does the job.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This captured me from beginning to end.  I love the whole series.  I hope this series continues.<br />I can imagine all kinds of situations and I'm sure the author can, also.
B008602KQI|5.0|It is a story of power and control from the state.  It is clear that resistance comes from solidarity among the people.  I am looking forward to the movie portrayals of the rest of the trilogy.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I read \\"A Team Of Rivals\\", the book which this was loosely based on, in the course of a week's vacation. I didn't know much about Lincoln, but I couldn't put the book down; I read it for about 6 hours a day. The book had so much more cinema in it than this film did.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis nailed Lincoln and deserves all the accolades, but in focusing solely on the passage of the amendment freeing the slaves, Spielberg missed an awful lot of great stuff which would have made this movie a lot more riveting. And by incorrectly including Connecticut legislators in the \\"nay\\" column, he also managed to insult an awful lot of people from Connecticut.<br /><br />I know that people always say the book was better and that no movie can capture a book's depth, but he left out scenes of Mr. and Ms. Lincoln traveling through Washington DC at night surrounded by wounded soldiers and the horror of war; a scene of Seward recovering from his wounds from the triple assassination attempt and noticing that flags were at half-mast - that's when he realized the President had been killed (no one would tell him); scenes of Lincoln's new cabinet deriding him behind his back, though they later loved him like a brother; and even scenes of Lincoln going out to hang with his cabinet just to get away from his wife.<br /><br />I am in the minority about this, but I think Spielberg movies lack depth, and that's certainly true with this film. He picks easy subjects and then comes up with a shallow film every time.
B005HWUBZ0|4.0|I gotta say that I love Mayer's previous album more, but this one is just as enjoyable. He hasn't lost his touch. The classic vibe is still there but Mayer Hawthorne offers music which is more friendly to general audience.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a fun game in which you can strive to constantly best your own prior scores with each of the &#34;hands&#34; dealt within the four dragons. It doesn't jade, since you do strive to do better each time. Definitely makes the gray cells come alive.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|It's kinda hard to find good music nowadays. Mayer Hawthorne provides just that, especially to those who miss good old traditional R&B music. He did a good job in this album, definitely. I love almost all the tracks and overall, this is a record well-done.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I have this for viewing power points during class. I have edited research papers on it in word format but its a little slow as typing on a tablet screen is slower than a keyboard.
B00A757EFW|3.0|it is okay to play not really a pac man fan got it for my daughter to play just to keep busy
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|This app is on my sons tablet and he likes it. His main complaint is that is tedious to collect enough coins to get additional sharks.
B0015XHQTY|5.0|I like this episode very much 'cause it's emblematic for eastwood style. He's my favourite american actor, and I follow his carreer since the western films.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game for all ages. My five year old can do the easier ones and the harder ones are fun for adults.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|I find older movies better than the newer ones. Hollywood tries to copy them sometimes and they fail. I have to add two more words to submit so here are thirteen.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|One of the world's best stage shows! Have seen it in Atlanta,GA,Greenville,SC, Madison,WI and Paris,France!<br />Yes, we're Le Miz freaks! And the movie is beyond expectations. When's the last time you saw a movie and got chills and goose bumps! Or were moved to tears- not often I bet! But Le Liz was captured in all its glory, music and emotion!<br />GREAT JOB!!!!! We put it on just to watch the specials, and just seen the movie twice since Christmas, well Surprise, we were sucked in again and stayed up late to watch it again!!!!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Nice changes from the first game. Just wish you could level up more without glu credits since I do not want to pay cash for them.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is all about the message the story tells. Very inspiring film with a powerful message. I highly recommend this movie!
B00B935SUY|4.0|I enjoyed the historical focus surrounding Sound City from obscurity to the hieghts of the 70's-80's.  How a lesson could be observed when advancement of a new digital systems technology wraps around an analog standard of music recording.  Creativity, process and evolution of the recording process was well done for Grohl's debut film.
0345535421|5.0|Reading the book really helps clarify all that you may miss whilst watching this epic show. There is so much happening, but Martin writes in such a superb way that it is easy to keep track of. Treat yourself, especially due to the low price Amazon offers.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very worthwhile read from excellent writer---what you need to know about yourself and your loved ones<br />take test in back of book before reading
B001XUPGLY|5.0|From the first time I  ever saw this movie, it has always been my most favorite Star Trek.  The  crew show their impish, tongue-in-cheek characters.  They save the planet.  They save the whales.  They save San Francisco.  It has all the banter between McCoy and Spock, the &#34;Scottyisms&#34; and other Star Trek classic dialogue.  My goal is to introduce my grandsons to a movie series that is timeless and this movie is at the top of the list.
B005R4255C|1.0|Wow, what a disappointment.  These folks butchered Michael's songs. Mixes are never usually good, but this mixing is quite worse. Many of the mixes use a static noise to cut right to the next song and it actually songs pretty amateurish. Maybe the live show is good, but just listening to these songs is gutwrentching. They've really destroyed them. I can say the only thing worth burning was Planet Earth/Earth Song, but even the sound is messed up on Earth Song. The 1:25 solo version of I'll be there is kind of nice too, but that's really it. The medleys are just terrible and I don't believe Michael would have approved of this nonsense. Stick with the extras on the albums he put out, like the Bad 25 version. Those extras and some of the songs to be released in the future were recorded by Michael and then shelved for various reasons, but when you're dealing with already released songs and remixes forget it. Live cds will be genuine to the Jackson sound too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Each episode carries the family and servants of Downton Abbey further along in the course of their lives. In season 2, they are caught up in the urgency of World War I. Scenes of trench warfare in France, changes to life in the village and in the great house are the background for the personal changes in each character. There's love, hate, jealousy... the full range of human experience.<br />The series is addictive.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This was a well packaged 25th anniversary tribute and a real treat for fans. The original album is Michael's prime in my opinion. This was the height of his world wide popularity and the songs are uplifting and still fun yet innovative. This deluxe package gives you the original album plus a second disc of additional tracks and remixes.  \\"I'm so blue,\\" \\"Price of fame\\" and \\"Al Capone\\" are great tunes. \\"Al Capone\\" is actually the origin of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" but holds its own as a  song. The remix of \\"Speed Demon\\" is probably the best Jackson remix I have ever heard and actually makes the song better, Most other remixes are too busy and lose the original Michael feel, including the ones on this album. The best part is still to come though: a fantastic DVD and CD of his live show in Wembley. This show is yet another reason why I think he was at his prime during this era. His live show was superb. His steps are at their prime and he sings all the songs unlike some later years where some were lip synched. The concert shows why he as the king of pop and a superb performer, but also an outstanding vocalist.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun game. Easy to play without spending real money.  Very much a &quot;do what you are told&quot; for the 1st few levels but becomes slightly more &quot;free play&quot; later.  I would like more autonomy, oh well.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Great movie. Depp captures the spirit of Ed Wood like no one else ever could. Martin Landau's Bela is perfect
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Watch it on Bluray and it was like I remember it in the theather but not on 3D :(. Will be getting my 3D on this weekend can't wait.
0385751532|4.0|Very educational for my daughter about the horrific events that occurred during the holocaust.  She has a new appreciation for it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great family movie with teenagers. Saw it with my daughter and it is three times and counting. Worth seeing again and agai
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Very appropriate for children 5-8. My grandchildren caught on quickly and have enjoyed playing this game when they are at my home.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I usually listen to these but decided the price was right. Finished the book while taking a bath (TMI). I was a bit wrinkly when done. It was interesting but seemed shorter.
B003B02O7I|2.0|I didn't like the writing or the plot. It didn't hold my interest. I have always enjoyed Grisham's writings and this was a disappointment.
B001G50SLE|4.0|My son watched this series devoutly and it seemed rather strange until I gave it a chance. The banter may reference events some of  the boomers understand. The music certainly brings back some moldy oldies.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|The transition over from Google Reader was so incredibly easy, and so far I love Feedly. Clean, simple, and exactly how I want my RSS experience to be.
1400052173|5.0|I read this and it made me angry. I have heard a few stories about how the medical community will use you for research and you will be none the wiser. This woman made a tremendous contribution to science. It would have been nice if she understood what was being done with her cells.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|A couple of keystrokes gets you into any of the zillion secure sites you need to access on a daily basis -- a must-have for anyone who sits in front of a computer all day, or who is constantly switching between devices. This app declutters and simplifies your digital life.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I am very satisfied with this new album studio release because it has one of the best songs ever written and produced in years too bad I did not receive this CD at its official relase date which was on March 26 for the US in spite of the fact that it was released on Europe on March 22 of this year. But it feels good to have 4 extra songs included on this Deluxe Edition.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I like the calculator because it was very useful for my class! The numbers is very big and clear! Check it out!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|When my daughter visited for Easter, I suggested we look at this series in the evenings.  I had already viewed Season 3 so I was eager for her to catch up so that we could discuss it.  Needless to say, she loved it!<br /><br />We both have become very involved in the character's lives and their story lines.  The acting is superb, the costuming in spot-on, and the filming is excellent.  We can't wait until Season 4 begins next fall.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I bought the game because it was a good distraction for my boyfriend's nieces and nephew.....Then eventually once they left the game became very interesting to myself and I play it every once in a while!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|I did not feel I would like this novel, but found myself wanting to know the result of Reacher's investigation. I will read his first book now.  Vee jay
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Before reviewing the Downtown Abbey Season 3 DVD, I first have to say that the Amazon on-line video of cast members describing their favorite scenes was excellent.  You see them as the actors, not their characters, but it is obvious they love their roles because their characters do shine through in these brief but fun interviews.  I bet they miss being at Highclere when the filming is done.  If you are a Downton fan and haven't seen the Amazon video, be sure to click on it.<br /><br />  We just started watching Downton on PBS, during reruns, starting with the second from the last episode of Season 3, couldn't imagine how we'd never seen it, became immediately hooked and ordered the season 1 and 2 boxed set, UK edition (in the gold-colored box).  We watched both seasons within a month's time, which was great because you could see where the characters came from and gauge how they developed into their Season 3 personnas.  We then ordered Season 3, UK version, from Amazon on a Monday and it was in the mailbox on Friday (using the free delivery), and after finishing Season 2 with the magnificent Christmas show, jumped into the Season 3 opening episode the next evening. You can't savor these and watch just one episode at a sitting.  While we will be done before too long, the beauty of owning all 3 seasons on dvd is that before Season 4 starts, we will just start over with Season 1 and watch all three again.  Season 3 (so far) has moments of joy, but also seems to have a darker, sadder, side to it.  Maybe that makes the characters (the ones who survive) more real in their vulnerability.  But, I really do hope the actors continue to love it as much as the viewers, when Season 4 comes, because I would hate to see any more characters killed off.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I liked the book. If you wish to start cooking provides you with good start and excellent structure to do so.<br />However, I found it a bit overmarketed. I read the previous two books of Tim and found them also a bit too overmarketed. It is interesting read, but somehow out of the cooking there is no much value. You won't learn how to learn everything. The concept is very vague and empty. This book won't teach you how to learn languages faster for example. It is written but it is like empty concept which you won't find practical way to use it.
B009K916ZK|4.0|Had an issue one time to connect to a projector in the middle of a meeting but started working later as if the connection was lose.<br />Great product, and great quality
B005IQZB14|5.0|I'm a guy and found her story so well written that I couldn't put it down.  Many of her issues in life would overlap with anyone, male or female. Bravo for getting beyond it all. A very brave trek and a great read...
1439199388|4.0|This  book  presents  a  startling  way  of  understanding  some  of  the very  baffling  diseases. ( I  practiced  medicine  for  years.)  An  elegant  dissertation.  A  must  read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|GREAT TRILOGY, READ ALL THREE IN ABOUT 10 DAYS, ONLY BECAUSE I HAD TO GO TO WORK!  COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF THIS NOVEL!  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT, IT PROBABLY CAN'T TOUCH THE BOOK BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT ANYWAY!  THIS BOOK IS KIND OF A CINDERELLA MEETS KINKY STORYLINE.  BE PREPARED!
159420411X|5.0|Author  does  a  magnificent  job  of  explaining  statistics/predictions.  He  shows  how  we  should  not  unquestioningly  trust  statistical  &#34;results&#34;.  It  has  armed  my  discussions  with  my  stockbroker.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|MY STEP-SON GOT ME STARTED ON THIS AND I WENT ON NETFLIX AND WATCHED THE FIRST TWO SEASONS.  I PURCHASED SEASON 3 ON AMAZON SO THAT I WILL BE CAUGHT UP BY THE TIME THE NEXT SEASON STARTS!  GLAD I DID BUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 4!!!  IM DEFINITELY HOOKED!  NOT REALLY INTO THE BLOOD AND GUTS BUT THE STORY LINE IS WONDERFUL AND EASY TO FOLLOW.  MAKES ME WONDER HOW LONG I WOULD LAST IF THIS HAPPENED TO US????
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved playing this game and can not wait for the next one! Hope it will be out soon. I will play this a second time...the maker of this did a phenomenal job!!! Hurry hurry hurry with the next one!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|READ ALL THREE IN ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF.  (I HAD TO WORK OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKER)  GREAT STORY LINE, KIND OF A CINDERELLA WITH A KINKY SIDE.  NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FIND A MAN LIKE CHRISTIAN GRAY!  IMPOSSIBLE!!!!  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE, IM SURE IT CAN'T COME CLOSE TO THE BOOK BUT I WILL GLADLY WATCH IT ANYWAY!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Excellent replacement for your feed reader. All functionality are there and is way easy to migrate. It connects to you current google reader and import everything you have there.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I READ ALL THREE BOOKS IN ABOUT 5 DAYS.  I WAS GLUED TO THE PAGES, WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT.  STORY LINE WAS GREAT, EXCITING AND UNBELIEVABLE AT TIMES.  HIGH RECOMMEND TO ANY AGE GROUP.  MY HUSBAND EVEN WENT WITH ME TO SEE THE HUNGER GAMES...THE MOVIE BASED ON THE FIRST BOOK.  HE LOVED IT, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIES TO COME OUT.  I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO COMPARING IT TO THE BOOK.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read about young people killing each other but the story sucks you in and held my interest throughout the whole book.<br />Thanks Amazon for &#34;loaning the book&#34; !
B001KZVQJI|5.0|It's the movie i wanted brand new in the package an adds more scenes to the movie, and amazing on blu ray.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|love home iron, the first 2 films were exelente and waiting for the May 3 for the third film, thanks for the good service and recommend it to everyone, thank you very much
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the BEST GAME EVER according to me and my friends!!!!! I would still buy it if it was<br /><br />15$! REALLY worth it. EVERYONE should buy it. It is the opposite of a rip off.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Its nice use when your really bored. I like that fact you can change the cover of the cards play the easy to hard levels. But it gets old fast.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|My brush with bad pharma was at the dentist. Got pushed into an expensive and pointless treatment of Arestin. Since then I've decided I will ask these 3 questions of any medical professional who wants to prescribe me a drug:<br /><br />1. Can you show me the data the convinces you this drug will help my condition?<br />2. Have you received any financial incentives to prescribe this drug?<br />3. Would you prescribe this to your daughter/husband/best friend/self?
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Use it all the time, makes ordering from the phone as easy as sitting at my desk machine. If you've got a Droid, you need this app...
B000SEIBB8|5.0|Some books really don't need ratings, this is one such book. Any experienced software developer should own a copy of this book and should have studied this book. Beginners are recommended to maybe also buy Alan Shalloway's book titled Design Patterns Explained as companion read or as a primer.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Fast paced and excellently written.  The second book starts off right after the first book and takes you farther into the underworld of Lisbeth.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Spellbinding with a fascinating story line, another winner in this<br /> series.  Could not put it down, hard to believe its a teen book, but that is apparent as there are no sex scenes.
B000H6H81Q|5.0|Very well made and authentic. A great hit with the recipient. Those who mhave been to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science will appreciate it.
1451695195|2.0|As a preface, I taught the book 'A Wrinkle in Time' for 9 years and so I am extremely familiar with every little nuance of the story. I am only part way through the book but what he describes as NDE sounds like it was lifted directly from the pages of Madeleine L'Engle's book. So I suppose my irk comes from feeling like I'm reading fiction. Those who aren't familiar with 'A Wrinkle in Time' will likely not care, but I find it grating and like the whole experience was an exercise in hyperbole.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|One of the most beautifully written but poignant works I have ever read. In fact I read it twice to try to soak up some of her amazing prose.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I love the characters, I love the plot, I love the writing. Why don't more people love this show too? It's better than most of the other post-apocalyptic stories out there.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Recently purchased a new ultrabook convertable for my personal use.  I bring it to work with me so that I don't have to feel like I am using company resources to check on my personal items like emails, on-line banking, eBay, etc.  Was using my phone as mobile hotspot but not real convient.  This Anker USB 3.0 Ethernet adapter is great and giving me excellent performance.  Highly recommend this adapter.
B000002KHF|4.0|I recieve the product in time and in perfect conditions. My expectations were high because I like Van Morrison music and prove it one more time that I was rigth.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. My favorite of all her books was &#34;Can You Keep a Secret&#34;. Looking forward to the next one.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is WAY too addictive. If you like these kind of match games, then this game is perfect for you.<br />It's a great way to kill time while waiting in line, for an appointment, whatever.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Just took a trip and was able to use this along the way. Easy to use, especially for a beginner like me.
B005LAIGLE|3.0|The movie was alright , But not what I thought it would be but in all I can deal with it!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I honestly did not want to pick up yet another new show, when the Fall season hadn't even ended yet, but I'm glad I forced myself to watch this. If you like personal character stories with scifi elements and humor, you'll probably love it.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I love this app. I have already done so many pictures on it and cant wait to do more. i suggest this like crazy!!! I love it! I dont think.I have anything bad about it!
0061928356|5.0|Exciting book... sort of hope there's a sequel.  Can't wait to read the author's second novel, whenever that comes out!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I saw Dr. Alexander on Katie Couric's show.  After listening to him, I had to read his book.  He did a marvelous job of telling his NDE.  I couldn't put the book down.  I would recommend this book to everyone because everyone needs to hear his story for so many reasons.
0765325950|5.0|All the loose ends carefully tended with treachery on every side so those who were true could not even trust themselves....extremely well done
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|This episode was yet another shocking one but then again they all are. This show certainly pushes the envelope.  HD looks good on my Mac too.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I really like this game.  It has a good story along with some challenging hidden object scenes.  I've played other HO games and the scenes were way too easy.  That's why I appreciate Twisted Lands.  It's also a relatively long game to play which is nice.  Really love this game!
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Michael doesn't disappoint me again. I have read a number of the Harry Bosh Novels and I have enjoyed everyone of them. Angels Flight kept you guessing the entire book. There was a number of twist and turns. WAY TO MICHAEL another awesome book.
B005LAII8A|3.0|I was really expecting this movie to be a little better, but i'm happy to have it in my collection.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Quick, flexible, and reliable.  Has leapfrogged ahead of accuweather's app, which used to be my favorite weather app.  The new standard!
B000FS9FC6|5.0|I have never watched the movie. Bought it as a gift, so now he and I can watch it together! Arrived very timely and seems perfect.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Absolutely love this movie!  Dory stole the movie, of course.  If you aren't holding your sides from laughter when she does her whale immitation, you cannot have a sense of humor.  The movie is adorable from start to finish.
B00005NRO3|5.0|I bought this for me when I bought two others for his birthday. Love the Scream movies. It arrived very timely and seems perfect. Price was very good.
B004G606K8|5.0|Fantastic. withing the 1st 2 chapters you will be consumed with this book. before you finish i can promise you will will have already purchased the 2nd book dragons of winter night!
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I'm already on my second read, as I couldn't stop the first time and do all the activities.  Amazingly, I don't usually read books a 2nd time, but this one I can't wait!  I had a colleague recommend it to me, and I am so glad she did.  I've read about 50 books on positive thinking, the secret, etc., and this is one of my absolute favorites.  Worth every dime!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|this was a great movie.  It had great scenery, great casting great story, and great acting. I recomend it to every one.
B00BU18U82|5.0|I is the best game ever so get it you will like it I play it all the time.I have fun play it to past time
B003FOFJAY|5.0|This is one of my favorite episodes. Luke and Lorelai finally get to enjoy a date night between two people who have cared about each other for many years.  So lovely.  Such a romantic and enjoyable episode.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is kind of a British Little House on the Prairie.  It's a coming of age story of a young girl in a rural setting. Young Laura leaves her home in the tiny hamlet of Lark Rise to begin a job at the post office in Candleford. The acting is first rate, with any number of memorable characters.<br /><br />I confess that I bought it because Laura's father is played by the amazing Brendan Coyle of Downton Abbey fame, and he's just as wonderful in this. In fact, the relationship between Robert and Emma Timmins is a joy to watch.  They don't always agree about everything but they always love each other.<br /><br />If you're looking for something wholesome, give this series a try.
B00886XQO0|4.0|Like i said they sound great and they are the most comfortable headset ive ever worn but there kinda price
B005LAII80|5.0|In this era of slick but ultimately soulless PG-13 blockbusters, DREDD is a welcome reminder that a concisely told, small-scale action movie can be just as entertaining as watching hundreds of CGI cities explode. Unapologetically gritty and honest in its ambitions, DREDD is like a refreshing blast of punk rock in a scene grown used to showy, interminable guitar solos. Looking at it this way, it's easy to see why this movie has enthused many to the point of obsession while simply confusing others.<br /><br />The creative team gets pretty much everything right. Alex Garland sensibly keeps the word count down in his taut screenplay, for the most part leaving the characters' actions to do the talking. The artistic cinematography really comes alive in the colorful slow-mo scenes, creating the most enjoyable movie rendering of the comic book form I've seen since SIN CITY. The 3D is also masterfully done. It makes me wonder why many Hollywood films with far bigger budgets have been unable to come up with something as visually stunning as this. The directing by Pete Travis is solid and functional, and while there are a few rough edges, for me that's all part of the film's punky appeal.<br /><br />The excellent cast really throw themselves into their roles. Karl Urban plays Dredd as a nigh-unstoppable force of nature with no time for anguished reflection, which is just as it should be. Olivia Thirlby is a revelation as Judge Anderson, striking the perfect balance between vulnerability and toughness. Lena Headey oozes dead-eyed menace as Ma-Ma, the villain of the piece. Her understated, even tragic performance makes a refreshing change from the ludicrous super-villains that usually appear in action movies.<br /><br />DREDD is one of the most immersive movies I've seen for a long time. Its visual style, its evocative electronic score and the performances of its leads all work together to create a fascinating world that lingers in the memory long after the credits roll. While early John Carpenter movies are the obvious reference point, it could also be said that DREDD is comparable to BLADE RUNNER in that both films focus on building their own distinctive atmospheres instead of following the trends of the day. And like its more illustrious predecessor, although DREDD flopped on its cinematic release, its reputation has been growing and growing ever since. A great achievement for all involved.

B008YI91HS|5.0|This has been out for many years and it's still a great movie to watch.  The dinosaurs that come to life are great and give a somewhat accurate picture of what they were like back then.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|THIS IS A VERY  INTERESTING MOVIE.  INFORMATIVE AND WELL MADE. RECOMMEND THIS AS IT WAS A TRUE STORY WITH A PEACEFUL ENDING.
1426308469|5.0|This book contains a lot of facts and great pictures.  My son uses it to compare his dino facts with another book and to learn more about them.  Great book and I do recommend it to anyone
B00028HBKC|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie at the movies.  I had to purchase this item for my movie collection.  Very passionate and inspiring movie.
B001XUPD94|3.0|Not the best. I prefer Star Treks II IV VI or first contact. This one is probably the worst of the series.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|J-Law is a babe galore, she looked hot as hell (pun intended). Curves to no end, better in HD. All and all it was entertaining.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I liked the bok thou there is this one thing I didn't like the ending  it's only if Gwendolyn and Thor where together and  he was just training in the legion it could be much better.
B000H1RFKU|5.0|This has to be one of the best that Washington ever made. You can watch this over & over. Never seems to get old. Love the music!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Wanted some spare batteries for a red dot sight on a firearm, and this pack provided a good value. They work as expected.<br />*Update 8/2013*<br />Since I posted the previous review, I've also discovered that my garage door openers use these batteries. They work fine and having spares on hand is great. Upgrading from 4 to 5 stars because I can't find any fault with the product, the seller, or the price.
B00006LWSF|4.0|I actually only like about 3 songs on this. I also have the movie which is a classic and watch this over & over!
B001IFZL50|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone that is a big military movie fan. Enjoyed the series when it oringally ran on HBO.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is great.  I have gotten addicted to this entire series.<br /><br />If you have prime, you can get season 1 and 2 for free.
0451530829|2.0|I like all Jane Austin novels and was hoping to add to my collection but I did not care for this format.  the book is standard paperback size but had commentary from 2 others and notes at the end.  I do not want a bunch of unasked for notations in my novels.  I will order Emma again but a different version.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Every song on this CD is a hit, JT did an excellent job!!  It has been well worth the wait!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is a talented bunch of actors and great writing for yet another season. Always light and feel good entertainment.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Sky fall brought the James Bond series full circle to the original. The head of the 00 branch is replaced by 'M', 'Q' is brought into the r&d section, moneypenny becomes the executive assistant and bond is of course 007 at the end. Too bad they destroyed the original car complete with guns in front grill and ejector seat.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Even though the subject matter is dark and disturbing, it tells the real story behind all the news fluff and repetitive facts. You are truly involved in these heros lives, hoping all of them will return home safely and not make the ultimate sacrifice.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Wow!!! Great twists, great plot changes, I wanted the house until ... Not spoiling it for you all with this review
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I really enjoyed Bill O'Reilly's narration of his book. He is factual and concise but never boring! Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly for a story my entire family enjoyed very much.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Amazing from start to finish, and it gets better with each listen.  I feel lucky to have stumbled onto this album.
B001KWTBQQ|4.0|It's visually entertaining (though maybe a bit video-gamey) and if you're a Star Wars junkie, you'll get your needed fix, but I feel like the narrative was sacrificed for the sake of cramming in mega-battle scenes.  More emphasis on the story would have made it better.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love this show.  Very excited to see the next episode. I love the relationship between Ragnar and his wife.  I love the strength of the female characters
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Very cute and funny!  Recommend it.  My husband and I both liked it and would watch it again.  Maybe not a &#34;must see&#34; but it's cute!
B00ALCBU4M|1.0|It could have been a nice movie. Story line started OK but after awhile it was getting bad. Real bad! They kept saying the uniforms were authentic. But then one wonders, how can a Wehrmacht officer (collar emblems) wear a SS uniform? Very big mistake in the uniform department. Apparently they did not do their research well. A very big let down. This is just for the uniforms! The storyline is pathetic. Do not bother buying nor renting. A big let down. I really wanted to enjoy this movie.
B000001EHS|5.0|I couldn't find these original songs on iTunes, only current remakes by the band, so had to purchase a CD.  This particular CD has ALL of their hit songs and the price was great.  Very happy I have this now.
1878424319|5.0|This book was easy to read with some simple concepts to get your mind thinking. I wish I would have read this in the beginning of my spiritual journey because it gives a nice guide and basis for you to build on. Read through to the end because it is all tied together very nicely with step number 4.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|This may not be Hitchen's greatest work but it is certainly one of his most valuable.  A hallmark of Hitchen's work is it's relentless honesty.  He carries that honesty with him as he embarks on life's final journey, capturing for the reader his struggle with cancer and his own mortality.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I downloaded this just to give it a quick try. It is a matching game. The cube turns, and twists and moves easily so you can play off all sides.  It is like potato chips, bet you can't play just one
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Started reading this after the first one, got through the first chapter and have never picked it up again.  I think I'm done with 50 Shades.
B00BESJYAY|2.0|Gerard Butler is a fine actor, I adore Elizabeth Shue, this is why I watched this film. Gerard helped produce it, not sure why. It may have seemed better in the script form. It's a qaint movie about a southern Cali life , some life lessons in here, but after it's all said and done, it's about a wave....ho-hum
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Pretty fun game, love the efffects on these games.  Hours of fun and enjoyment. I suggest this game, you will like it.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|This is a unusual film, Alot of folks liked the book, I didn't read it, nor will I after seeing this movie, I am not sure why it's so popular. It must be a Jennifer Lawrence thing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game.  They got me hooked, then yanked it from me.  You have to pay after you play for awhile.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Couldn't put book down. Glad I chose to read this one. Highly recomend it. A great read , a real page turner.
B00821OX98|4.0|I love people reaction the tone of the show. The people were real or everyday real. When fear set in the true traits are revealed.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|For every 5 times or so when i open the app my progress gets resetted. Please fix this bug. Good game btw. Hungry for more shark games? Well your looking at one of the best.
1455518999|5.0|This is good novel written by one of my continuing favor authors, David Baldacci.  It reads well, I'm not sure what will come next, he isn't a formula writer, He tells the story in the length that it needs to be, the story is well developed and he wraps it up nicely.  Some authors rush the ending, Mr. Baldacci does not do this.  I have read him for over 10 years and as long he continues to put out this kind of quality I will continue to do so.<br /><br />Overall good novel where I couldn't predict the ending; I read a lot and that makes it a good read.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|The bad stuff:<br />The game gave you a trial period. Sadly it was only about five minutes. Well I don't blame it, it was a demo. Any way you also couldn't sleep. So you make your house then it says that the trial period is over.<br />The good stuff:<br />The game was awesome beside the part that you had only about five minutes. I would prefer the real game. I understand it is a demo. And because of that you shouldn't have THAT much freedom. After I bought the real game it was so alike to the  demo I knew that the demo was a good demo for the real game. It is very clean my friends and I play it when we come over.<br />Over all:<br />I recommend this game before you buy the real game.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I love dexter! This season is really great! Its a must buy if you purchased and loved the first season.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These were recommended by a friend. I was surprised at how easily they integrated into my computer (Windows 7) and the sound and effects are great for the price.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Yeah I read the books and the books were better. But the story is cool and I can't wait for the other movies come out!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We can watch the Harry Potty collection over and over again... it's one of our favorites and we don't have kids in the house anymore!
B0013DCC72|5.0|I'm very happy with this album. I feel like I'm the last person on Earth to discover Incubus but this album is just what I was looking for in Rock.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|We loved the film, and every time I listen to the soundtrack it takes me back there. It is an incredible blend of original music by Ludovico Einaudi, classic and funk. If that sounds weird, just take a listen, or better yet, see the film. It just works.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Had to force myself to watch most of it, hope the next ones are better. Needs more Aidan Turner. Too much action and not enough plot or character warmth. Needs a better balance of both, what's the use of putting the characters in peril if you don't care what happens to them.
0670451495|5.0|Love this book. It's a treasured memento of our trip to Boston. We saw the statues of the ducks in Boston Public Garden and heard the stories of what this book means to the people of Boston. The book was in good shape and at a very good price.
0307740919|3.0|Had to read. Not a fan. Interesting class discussions. Glad it is over.  Difficult to get through, needed more structure.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Ruth Ozeki never fails to write an engaging novel. She manages to weave environmental concerns into her stories and her characters are developed so that you feel you know them and care about them. In this novel she zigzags between Japan and America; a teenager, whose diary from the past is found by a writer, an unknown number of years later: and the writer's current life. The idea of time is dealt with philosophically as well as in the reality of when the diary was written and how current it feels to the writer who found it.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Very well done. Being originally from Missouri felt pulled in by the landscape and familiarty of the people. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing to watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|Really great movie, such great actors... Can't wait to watch it again! Hope the next movie is just as good.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The first USB cord for my Kindle frayed so I had to get this.  So far so good. It came quickly and was packaged well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this on my phone and Kindle fire.  My grandchilden love it and play it every chance they get.  I haven't mastered it yet though, I keep running into trains!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This can be addicting!  I love playing it although time runs out too quick!  I still have to find out if I can get more B's to buy cards.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Excellent, Lee Childs does it again. The crescendo plot build up to the very end is superb. Reacher again is able to exact his justice in the most appropriate manner.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|works good with the free version but limited to very few copies then told to buy pro version to continue printing
B0044IABFS|5.0|I found the show overall to be interesting with lots of thought put into the production.  The cast did a wonderful job playing there parts.  The final season seemed kind of rushed for a plausible ending but overall I would highly recommend this series.
B0085W09ME|2.0|did not like it was very confusing and did not understand  a lot of areas in the program and just got the APP deleted
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such a wonderful show, its addicting and you will want all seasons of this series. Highly recommend it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great and fills the whole screen great APP using it all the time and it is free which makes it great
B001FFBI82|4.0|A great movie for marine veteran or anyone who are interesting about the Marine Corps.  A 90% reality about the US Marines’ life or experience from boot camp to their fleet unit and deployment.  That’s why they said the Marines are the few, because it wasn’t really meant for everyone.
0764197843|5.0|Purchased to use during my teachings in Egypt! This has been an excellent resource for students! Thank you! I recommend this to all of my students for self study!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have enjoyed this entire series. It presents an era long gone. The acting is great- both upstairs and downstairs. Gives an overall picture of that time.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Have watched this classic many times and the bonus features are also very interesting. Good quality that holds up well.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I'm a 30-something professional woman whose entertainment tastes lean more torwards the Criterion collection than Gossip Girl and yet I am absolutely addicted to Pretty Little Liars.  This is a show that is run by people who know what they're doing.  They know how to play up camp sensibilities and soap opera melodrama while actually crafting an twisty-turny murder/stalker mystery.  Yes, it's a cheesy soap opera at times, but it includes some of the best background literary allusions I've seen on a teen show.  They hit you over the head with To Kill a Mockingbird in the first season, but The Great Gatsby, Emily Dickinson, Nabokov and Hedda Gabbler all come into play by the third season.<br /><br />If you watched the first few episodes of the first season and didn't like the show, I seriously urge you to continue watching.  Somewhere around the homecoming dance episode in the first season the show takes off like a gunshot and keeps getting better and better.  The actors improve greatly and the writing gets a lot tighter.  The first Halloween special (season 2)is definitely something to see.
B008Y73940|5.0|I really like Matthew McConaughey. His parts aren't all that different, but he brings a great style to the roles he plays. The supporting cast is also good in this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After seeign the movie to the first one I wanted to know what happened and I was so amazed. The final book is such a great ending and I love this story and all of its ups and downs. Such an easy read and very entertaining.
030758836X|1.0|I liked the first half very much, then some editor must have got ahold of it and had to make the ending just too perfect....and too much.  Less is sometimes more.  I won't ruin it by saying any more, but the ending was just bad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|They are such great reads. I literally read the entire series in two days. I couldn't put it down and they are such easy reads. They remind me of Harry Potter because they are large books but the reading is so easy that times goes by fast.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Let's face it, folks:  Charlize Theron has some serious acting chops.  And the special effects in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN are second to none.  Yet even Charlize seemed to realize she was making a film of Epic Fail Proportions, because her portrayal as the evil, immortality-seeking stepmother is as wooden and as lifeless as a used clarinet in an antique store.  And portraying Snow White, pray tell?  The enigmatic (not) Kristen Stewart, treating me to my first experience watching her \\"act\\", as I've avoided the countless Twilight films like the cholera morbus.  You can put Stewart's Snow White in a dungeon, or in a haunted forest where trees are chasing her (yeah, it's all nonsense), or in armour storming a castle, and she looks as bored and as impassive as if she's waiting for her nails to dry.  So she's in the clutches of her evil stepmother, on the cusp of having her soul sucked out of her?  Feh.  Let her know when it's time to go to Starbucks.<br /><br />Playing the huntsman, the down-on-his-luck lad who is dispatched by the queen stepmother to go after Snow White in the haunted forest, Chris Hemsworth yacks an accent so thick you're not sure if he's mimicking Elvish Sindarin or Finnish Happy Hour; I still haven't understood a single word he's said.  And the dwarves. . .if I go there, I'll have to start drinking, and it's still morning.  In any event, if you want to see a nonsensical fantasy with a vacuous story, laughable acting, all wrapped in quality special effects in an effort to sugarcoat its shortcomings (an effort that fails), then by all means give SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN a gander.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
0316182060|4.0|The wonderful book was adapted for a manga version, and I greatly enjoyed the delicious illustrations. However, that being said, since some supporting characters were not named, new readers will be a bit confused. I never really liked Maccon myself, what with his loud and his tendency to get naked a little too many times. That and the fact that he isn't the sensitive kind of husband. (Ah well. Werewolves...) Still, he looked exactly as I had pictured him to be, and Alexia was gorgeous. Genevieve Lefoux was smartly buttoned up always, and she looked amazing. Especially with that cute eye thing when she went to Lord Akeldama's house. The little post-script, a page of adorable illustrations, was hilarious and summed up the less-than-saccharine-sweet ending. I am eager for more. :D
034580404X|2.0|Finally read the trilogy.  Lots of sex of course; however, little real substance,and lots of repetition, with the third in the trilogy being the least interesting and satisfactory to me.  My daughter was cute.  She reminded me that people weren't reading 50 Shades for the author's literary skills.  I recently read \\"Play With Me\\" by Kristen Proby because the reviews were very complimentary.  I thought it was awful, and full of similarities to 50 Shades, such as characters live in Seattle, rich boyfriend, lots of sex, though less interesting than 50 Shades, and so on and so on.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I might be old (52) but I still like my rock and Avenged gets it done.  I have my favorites on hte CD of course, but the whole thing is good.
1426308469|5.0|Beautiful ideal for children, bright and easy reading informative... Loved them, gave them out to a child that has nut allergies, for Easter. Loving them, will purchase another time for baby shower gifts.
B008J34466|3.0|I love Pink but this is not her best CD.  Of course there are a couple of good ones but the rest is just ok for me.  I still love you Pink and you keep doing what you are doing but make your next one more rock n roll please.
B000002VSN|5.0|I abosultely love this CD.  This is probably one of her last CDs that she still has most of her famous vocal range.  The additional song from her mother is also incredible.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I absolutely love Kid nRock.  It's like he writes his wongs just for me.  i love the diversity of his music and I believe he is my all time favorite artist!  Luv Ya Kid!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|great book.  John grisham did it again.  A lot of twists in the book.  I really enjoyed reading it. Can't wait to read is next one.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I like Bruno and this CD is pretty good.  It is pretty mellow but has it's moments and of course it should be heard with the one you love.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com<br /><br />One of the ten best motion pictures of all time. It is number 4 on my list. It has many delightful, humorous moments. The love between a father and a son portrayed in the film is equal to the love between a father and son as seen in the motion picture \\"The Champ.\\" Although it is fiction, the film vividly portrays the horror and tragedy of the Holocaust and the ultimate victory of good over the most monumental evil in history. You will laugh. You will cry, You will be almost overcome by man's inhumanity to man, but you will become a better and more grateful person from seeing the film. When we witness human tragedies in art, there is a spiritual renewal (catharsis) and our souls are purified. Then we can truly say, LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, and add the words of Ann Frank, \\"I think not of all the evil but of the beauty that remains.\\"<br /><br />4-18-13 Related to this, and coming from the bombing at the 2013 Boston Marathon  are the words of the little nine year old boy who was killed: \\"No more hurting - PEACE\\"<br /><br />See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures of enduring significance that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.<br /><br />Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute healpain.net and saveusa.biz
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I have always liked Aerosmith and this CD is just awesome!  The beginning of each song on this new CD reminds me of one of their old songs and I'm guessing that was intentional.  It is great because you think it might be an older song but it turns out to be a new song.  Thanks guys and I love the new CD and I love you!!!
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|What can I say, I am hugh Ellen Degeneres fan, and is not because I am her fan, but her book makes me laugh and brings peace to my life for a moment, I am not 100% good with the english language since my native language is spanish and I use her book to improve my reading and understanding in english... very funny book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An excellent book, couldn't put it down.  I do believe nearly all Americans wanted to now step by step what happened to that terrorest.
B00005JLEU|5.0|For that matter, one of my favorite movies ever. You've surely heard about how good Spirited Away is, so you don't need me to tell you how beautifully animated it is. Or how brilliantly crafted the story is. Or just how original it is. Spirited Away is light years ahead of the comparatively bland stuff that we've been getting from Disney and Dreamworks for all of these reasons. So my advice to you is to buy it, watch it (in Japanese, of course), and watch it again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|get it. its so much fun. I couldn't wait to play it. Awesome. if u r a horse lover I would recommend this 4 u.:)
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|A must read if you're serious about changing your life.<br />Easy to read and to the point, especially the Q&A
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Historical???  Lincoln slaps his son in public and swears at him?  He is shown losing his temper and cussing a few times.  Mary chews out Thaddeus Stevens in a reception line. Lincoln has his aids running around with money in folders for bribes.  An African-american soldier is shown jawing at Lincoln about promotions, then recites the Gettysburg Address to Lincoln.  Really? I read the book this was based on, A Team of Rivals, and never recall any of this happening.  I've read John Nicolay's (Lincoln's secretary) book on Lincoln and he states Lincoln never swore or cussed.  He did on occasion use some colorful language in his stories.<br /><br />You can nit-pick this movie apart. But what it comes down to is that it a beautiful too look at, Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic, and the and movie is boring and full of fiction.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|I bought it when was first released on VHS, then on DVD and now on Bluray.  Man ... I'm old. Hope next techonolgye breakthrough takes some time.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch has been a cop in our L A for a good little while now. He. Is always in trouble, always  working hard to speak for the dead of this city that he is assigned to ,might I say avenge. This outing gives us an outstanding performance as Harry's policy speaks for a murdered journalist from 20 years in his own past.<br />  Somehow I feel Raymond Chandler and Harry Bosch walk the same beat, and we are the better for it.<br /> Michael Connelly continues to give his readers the absolute best.

B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved the author's understanding of the deep connection someone can have with nature. Since I was a child playing in the woods, I've always loved the filtered light, dark shade, and woodsy odors. I liked that Grace loved Sam even before she met him in human form.

B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Each IRON AND WINE album has been a slow progression from the privious, often reminding me of Dylan's evolution from folk, to folk rock, to country rock, each album moving into someplace new, utterly creative and yet honest to the core belief of the artist. Sam Bean's core music has never changed. His lyrics have always been, and are, about Love and Sex, Sin and Christian spirituality, and rural southern pastorial imagery. Sean Beam's harmonic sophistication has grown, and now resides definately in the extended chords, and key modulation, that screams JAZZ! However, the melodic movements remain folk like, almost simplistic, yet open to vocal harmonies. (another key element to the IRON AND WINE sound.) If GHOST ON GHOST had stayed where KISS EACH OTHER CLEAN was, I'd have been really disappointed, something I've never experienced with this music.<br /><br />GHOST ON GHOST has brought it all together, piece by piece, which you've seen in each privious outing. The country/folk elements still show up in \\"Baby Backstage\\". The electronica he explored on songs like \\"Carried Home\\" still pop up on the songs. The tight rock song, perfected on his masterpiece THE SHEPHERDS DOG still exists on songs like \\"Grace for Saints and Ramblers\\"(the hit video is on Utoob). The heavy use of horns which first surfaced on IN THE REINS with Calexico, appears on almost all the songs. However, the privious album, KISS EACH OTHER CLEAN, showed the jazz chops that Sam Bean loves, like the insane sax solo on \\"Your Fake Name\\". Now, everything has come together, all invention has risen, and GHOST ON GHOST gives the fans the ultimate IRON AND WINE album. (At least until the next album.) Songs at times remains sparce, lots of negative space, only to slide into sonic textures, using the orchestral colors judiously, like brass chops, vocal harmonizing, strings, keyboards, stand up bass, percussion, back up singing, and Sam's acoustic guitar riffs, and pedal steel. This album especially explores vocal experimentations hitherto unheard on IRON AND WINE albums. AT times the voice has deep reverb, other times the instrumentation includes layered vocal parts, as the primary instrument of the song. Even the string charts, often the bane of production, flicker thru the soundscape subtley. \\"Sundown\\", for example, only has a small violin lead during the final 4 measures of the song. Overall, mid and slow tempo songs tend to predominate. However \\"Lover's Revolution\\" (My favorite song), starts out largo, SLOWLY increases tempo, until the song becomes a hard bop jazz tune, with sax solo ripping it up, until the last verse hits at PRESTO speed, all jazz chords circling your head. Only to RETARD back to the first tempo to finish. Amazing. GHOST ON GHOST presents as a relaxing, deep, introspective, jazzy, kaledoscopic, cinematic album. If you're a fan of the IRON AND WINE sound, or rather, SOUNDS, then get it. It will amaze.xperimentations hitherto unheard on IRON AND WINE albums.

If you're a fan of the IRON AND WINE sound, or rather, SOUNDS, then get it. It will amaze.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|As expected, Delta Machine continues the great line  of music that have been delivered by Depeche Mode throughout the years.  I have been a fan since their beginning and I have enjoyed  each of their productions.  Delta Machine is a high quality music experience.
B004QSQML8|5.0|To think this movie was made in the mid 80s is almost mind-boggling.  The effects could hold their own against any of the CGI-based movies of today.  Classic story of good versus evil.  Transports you to a fantasy world with ease.  Cruise's acting was not so good here - but we have to cut him some slack as this was one of his first roles.  All of the other acting, however, was good to superb (Tim Curry).  As far as the DVD pack, it came with everything as described - including both versions of the movie.
B0058BXG98|5.0|Although Oxygene is the album that made him, Equinoxe surpasses it in many ways. It's more consistent and feels like a more complete entity. The themes developed in Oxygene are pushed to another level, with the instrumentation even more lush and analog. I can't recommend the vinyl enough, hypnotic!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think the game was well created and welly thought through but there should be more levels for free I would say 150 levels for free.
B007P7UF0G|2.0|Love the show but we can't enjoy it, because the words cannot heard.  Only the orchestra music can be heard.
B005PK57IK|2.0|Unrealistic court drama. Unreal people. Stupid plots. Would be nice if real court cases went to trial with such alacrity.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I LOVE this HBO TV series, having it in my collection to watch whenever I want is truly an awesome thing.
B000N2HBSO|2.0|This was a tomb! too long, too many players. Very hard read. never finished after 200+ pages I read. I hate not finishing a book
B003G4W49C|3.0|There were definitely some interesting ideas in Ender's Game, and I wouldn't say it was bad in any way. But for me personally I never felt particularly attached to the story itself. There didn't seem to be much of a rise to a climax at the climactic moments, or if there was it didn't leave me particularly excited or nervous, as really good books always do. The writing made it obvious this was a book for young adults, which, again, isn't a bad thing, but just left me wanting a little more out of it. When I first bought this book I had heard great things about it being a classic.  I can see why it's a classic in scifi literature, through the views it expounds, but in general I don't see myself being motivated to read any more of the series or to read this book again.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great triology of books. You wont want to put it down.<br />Grab a seat and enjoy. Worth the time and money
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a very handy app. Easy to use has all the features you need for quick and easy problems to more complicated ones.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|candidly I did not finish this, however not because it was not enjoyable. It actually is and I plan to go back and read it cover to cover.<br />It provides a clearer understanding of how habits are created and what it takes to change them
B0083Z614S|5.0|This Classic Was Very Inspiring. So descriptive, positive and imaginative. Every character and every chapter came alive and made me feel like I was right there. I could almost taste the food and smell the flowers.<br />I recommend this book to everyone!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great trilogy. Grab a chair and read. Worth the money, worth the time.<br />Plan your summer read and then see the movies
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it it is so much better than temple run 2. You can find it on amazon or the app store. You need to type in Subway Surfers. RIGHT NOW! Your not getting any younger.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great trilogy of books. Worth the money and worth the time.<br />get all three and grab a seat. You won't want to put it down
B00CATSONE|5.0|I learned so much from this book and loved it! Everyone should read it and be surprised at the truth!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I purchased this cd expecting the usual Paramore sound which I greatly enjoy but what I got was an incredibly beautiful and mature album.  From start to finish the lyrics and music just speak to my soul.  Hayley is bringing it and showing us that she isn't just a pretty girl fronting a band.  She has a versatile soulful sound that is evident all over the compilation and the band is playing their asses off.  The breakdown in the end of Future is a truly beautiful piece of music. Definitely a start to finish play and one I can listen to multiple times.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this app is free and it has a great user interface and it actually works great i thought it would be sluggish and just work a lil bit and drag ass but im glad i got it. im impressed
B004G6009K|5.0|I bought this for my Granddaughter for Easter.  She is not quite 2 year old and absolutely loves it!  Very pleased and they love having the many different copies to keep one in the house, one in the car, one for the I-pad, etc.  Great Purchase!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|As I read this I was laughing out loud at various points which annoyed the hell out of people around me. So I encourage you to read this on buses or trains or airplanes, places where other people have no choice but to be in your proximity. Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so cool. when I first played it I was amazed even my mom loved it.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|It is not a bad runner game with jumping, sliding, and dashing but the controls are fairly poor. Whenever there are situations where you need to jump then immediately slide it will miss the slide gesture about 75% of the time which is very frustrating.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A while ago I was looking up the scribblenauts series after unlimited came out and I discovered this, I was saddened to find this was not on the amazon app store and was saddened. Now that it is its amazing
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The movie just doesn't grab you in the beginning. It gets better but not enough for me to want to watch it again.
B00C32REYI|5.0|I love the sounds on this album. James Blake is literally a singing poet. If you enjoyed his first effort, you'll love that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have loved this site for so long and the app is easy to use and gives you just what you are hoping for from the website.  Lurve!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Awesome film, visually stunning. I have encouraged so many of my friends to watch them telling me &#34; it wasn't their type of film&#34; only to tell me they really like it as well.<br /><br />Blu-Ray and 3D really complement the visual elements of this film.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I downloaded this for a fun distraction on our recent two hour flight and it was SUCH a hit!  I don't usually allow my toddlers to play with my kindle, so that may have been part of the allure, but it kept them so entertained.  They were sharing and giggling and encouraging each other to try new styles.  It's not educational, but it IS a lot of fun.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|What a great show.... just when you think the show couldn't get more mysterious they throw in another dimension.  Just when you think you've grasped two dimensions they throw in time travel, humans from the future (mysterious bald men), and a whole lot of stuff that... make for a great show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun and interactive game that is really fun to play.If you don't know what it will be like, it  is similar to temple run, except you have to swipe to go to the side instead of tilting your device. The only thing for me is that they are targeting this game at young kids, so why would they put a connection to face book on it? Otherwise, great game. I reccomend that you download it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Not generally into sci-fi, but after just a few shows, I'm hooked on Doctor Who. The main characters are just fun and very likable, and the bad guys......well, just let's say, the writer is very creative.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I didn't think a game could get better than Temple Run but the Run 2 has some great added features. Loved it.  Love them both.  Great new game.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought the movie was quite good. I had read the book previously, and while the plot was very interesting, the writing style detracted from my enjoyment. I found the author to be a poor writer, leaving unfinished thoughts or sentences from the main character's narrative. The movie surpassed the book. Was the movie stunning? No, but it was a very decent movie that did not have poor grammar to detract from my enjoyment.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Though the plot was a bit predicable, it was still a good watch!  I enjoyed it completely!  Would watch it again!
0307387178|3.0|I read this book because of John's book on Everest.  It wasn't as compelling as the Everest book and main character wasn't likable.  He was ignorant.  He went into the Alaskan wilderness, unprepared, and got into trouble.  The movie wan'st much better.
B008602KQI|5.0|I didn't read the novels but when I saw this listed on Amazon Prime for free I decided to give it a try.  I was thoroughly impressed!  It was an excellent movie and can't wait to read the books!
0553805460|5.0|Great book.  Its sexually graphic and I'm not sure If I believe everything in this book.  It was a nice escape and peek into the world of Wall street.
B007HO392S|5.0|I have this cd in my boombox and listen to it about once a week while I'm using my treadmill.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Wonderful show. Love all the characters and the plot lines. I know know why everyone that watches it is hooked.
B003WTE886|4.0|Taylor should keep on writing songs, but she shouldn't sing them... her voice is too monotone, and a little bit unclear.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I was reluctant at first to rent this movie since I'm 19 years-old and not really into kids' movies but, it was the movie my younger sisters, ages 9 and 12, really wanted to watch so I rented it. It turned out to be a pretty fun movie to watch and we were all kept entertained throughout the entire length of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a great game for girls and boys so you should get the game I give it a 1000000000 of 1000000000
074356619X|5.0|Rhonda Byrne produced a great combination of powerful knowledge, inspirations and motivational suggestions!  I love it and recommend it to everyone looking for direction in their lives.
0375703764|4.0|I'm not a very wide reader but I do read now and then but I was truly in love with this book. I like every sense of it and I couldn't stop reading it to the point I finished it in one week. It's Avery good story with some cool twists and it get you thinking but the only thing I didn't like was the end which seemed too empty for me and was way less than I expected from this awesome book. Beside this everything was perfect and. ReLly recommend the hardcover because the soft on has a lip where the book can get damaged.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Another great Cut the Rope game. This puzzle type game is well worth the ninety nine cents.  Get ready to continue the addiction.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I remember reading this to my cousin. He would just giggle when he would turn the pages & Grover would get upset. He would get so excited that he could hardly wait for the end. Great book to read, especially if you do Grover's voice.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I had high hopes for the movie at the start based upon the actors of the movie, but it was quickly diminished. If i could give the movie 1/4 star it would be too high of a rating. The dialogue was uneventful and I have seen better acting in my kids school play. Even if the movie is free to watch, it will cost you 2 hrs of your life that you wasted.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle app works just as well as my kindle device did. The books are actually easier to read on the tablet due to having a back light.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Although this set looks AMAZING on the surface, buyers beware.  I have had problems on about 40-50% of the episodes in terms of reading errors.  The faulty DVDs appear in perfect condition but will skip, jerk, and frequently NOT play.  I tried switching players (DVD, BlueRay, PS3, etc) and none worked.  I can't express how frustrating it is to be right in the middle of a GREAT episode...and it stops!!!  I was fortunate enough to get them exchanged...but the next set was the same, although the affected discs seemed to vary.  Main point...these DVDs were initially burned with obviously poor quality and the end result is some discs have fully functional episodes, some skip once, some skip entire scenes, some skip 10-15 second gaps every minute or so (really sucks in dialogue or action)...So just purchase another set because these are obviously of poor quality.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved how fun it was in the beginning, I had no idea how serious it would become! The thing I loved the most was how you really couldn't have guessed how things were going to turn out!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I'm old enough to have been a fan of the original Dark Shadows. I wouldn't have minded a little humor at appropriate times but this was nothing like the original. May have enjoyed it more under a different name. expectations would have been different
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a basic calculator..which is all I need or want for my Kindle Fire HD.  It loads immediately and the buttons are large and the calculations display large & clear.  I can't ask for anything more in this wonderful free app.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|i don't remember it now and did not order the dvd so I'd have to say it didn't make much of an impression
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I am really enjoying this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  What I like most is that once I select the app on my Kindle it turns right on and I select the musical genre and the music begins immediately.  So far no delays in the music starting.  A very generous selection of genres and styles of music to listen to.  I believe that this app will help me to explore different music as I intend to listen to new music as well as old favorites.  I recommend this to everyone who loves music.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|I did not watch this one before I ordered it. Loved the first one, this one not so much. Delivered on time in perfect condition
B0046B6X1E|5.0|Stephan King wrote a good book about&#34;Carrie&#34; and the movie did a good representation. Well, Stefan king is Stephan King
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|Has about 6 songs that she could have left out, but the rest are Great!  My favorites are NUMB, LOVEEEEE SONG, LOVE WITHOUT TRAGEDY, STAY, and POUR IT UP!!!!
B005544V6A|5.0|it was great show no killing just hard work good values lear a lot from it wish my lawyer were like that. lol
B00899ES5C|5.0|I'm obsessed with this show! Even though it's about a bunch of teenage girls (and I'm in my late 20's), it's very addictive!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This one of the easiest and fastest games I've played in a while.  It's played out beautifully.  Simple and easy.  Really good game.  The levels are challenging at times and exciting too.in
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie and we thought it was very intense.<br />I would recommend this movie to family and friends.
0811874192|5.0|I collect Pop-Up books of all genres and this book is one of my favorites. This intricate and beautiful page upon page of flower pop-ups is a wonderful addition to my collection
B00821OX98|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone into drama, action-adventure and sci-fi all wrapped up in one. The acting is 1st rate. The CG is 1st rate. By the end of the season I wanted more!<br /><br />Once in a while a story line goes somewhere and you're thinking that is so NOT what a rational person would do in this situation - or that is so NOT what the aliens would do based on what you've seen of them. Later, in season 2, you will learn more about the aliens that makes these actions make sense. Just keep watching!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never intended to read these books but my daughter talked me into it and I am so glad she did! I was Hooked almost right away and have now read all 3! The book was captivating and held me spellbound thru the whole thing! I was torn in who Katniss should choose to love! You have to read these books, young or old!!!
B003TTKB5I|5.0|This series is so enjoyable, with the perfect mix of serious and comedic interaction based on the foundation of people caring for people...So glad I can get this on Amazon and watch it whenever I want...Thanks Amazon!!!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book was difficult for me in the beginning. When I figured out the book was written from the point of view of Death, it finally made sense. After that, I would call it excellent. Although it is set in Germany during WWII, it is not a Holocaust book. It's a story of as young German girl, who through her stories and actions, comforts her family and neighbors during the war. It's her story and Death tells it well!
1475143389|5.0|This book is my new Bible of how to get the body that I want. The author is experienced in fitness and, with this book, you will get all of his essential knowledge about the topic, and that would prevent you from losing the time working out and eating in the wrong way.<br /><br />I think this formula to get in shape deserves my try, it's not the first book about the topic that I've read and it makes a lot of sense what it says.<br /><br />Plus, the author is willing to help with your doubts and difficulties for free. He replied my emails and gave me personal advise. What else could you ask for?
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|What you need to know:  effectively, Konami had Christopherson build a supergroup of assorted metal musicians, to construct a soundtrack.  That soundtrack is pure, condensed win.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Terrible singing by people who should not be paid to sing.  Singing all thru the movie ruined the movie experience.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|What a great story!  Heartwarming and so very funny!  This book had me hooked from the first page! A great read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can watch the stream when ever I want.<br />Good show. Funny and witty.<br />Looking forward to next season.<br /><br />Grama. Is my favorite person in the show.
1936594234|5.0|This book has changed my life.<br />it makes you think about how you view your life things and other people.<br />Please read this book if you want to change your circumstances around you.<br />I can tell you that since reading this book I stop worrying so much, I have more control of my life even dumped so called friends.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a really good story but I just didn't like how it was written.  Maybe I just didn't like the way the author worded a good amount of it.  But overall it was a good story... slightly predictable.  I just feel the book would have been better if this story was written by a different author.  I intend to read another one of Mira Lyn Kelly's books to see if it's just something about the writers style I didn't like.  Overall good story.  If you like this author then you'll like this book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great fun game but for some reason i can never get the updates for it but its a fun game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game is very very fun fun fun and motion is really smooth. i am really glad the physics looks so great.
B008COII1Y|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this movie.  I love a good zombie flick, and was sure I would hate this one; but it surprised me greatly.  When you make a movie with such mindless objects like zombies, you really have to feel invested in the living heros, and this movie does that.  The film-maker really makes you feel involved with the main character and builds on that investment throughout the film.  Yes, there are some little things that are annoying throughout the film.  The audio in some scenes was much too overpowering, they over-killed the music a bit much.  But, really that's nothing in comparison to the great story line and characters in this film.  If you're looking for big budget gore and scares, this probably isn't the movie for you.  But if you enjoy a good horror story, with a plot, then definitely check it out.
0738735027|5.0|I really like these cards.  Not only are they convenient to carry with me everywhere in my purse (just in case I need to do a reading for a friend, family member, client, or myself) because they are small cards....but they are also very unique yet very universal in illustrating the meanings of the each card in the deck without confusing anyone (if they are new to tarot cards, I'm not new to Tarot cards).  I have been learning and using Tarot since 2008.  I started out with the one of the most basic universal decks by Sharmin-Caselli and Rider-Waite.  So I recognize how similar the illustrations remained generally pretty similar in symbolism and examples (for some, not all the cards) to the universal meanings that I learned from basic decks that I started with, only instead illustrated meanings with beautiful cats.  Everybody I have done readings for with these cards love the cats on the cards :-)
0385523912|5.0|I'm an avid reader and particularly like nonfiction stories that pull the reader in. I read about this book while reading another one about North Korea, \\"Escape From Camp 14\\", which is also quite good.<br /><br />There are books that are fascinating in the way they enlighten us about things in the world, and there are books that are pretty well-written but aren't ones that demand a second reading. This is one that encompasses the best of both those qualities. Mrs. Demick's style of writing is simple but excellent, in that she doesn't go into unnecessary detail unless called for; at the same time, she writes with compassion and empathy without being overly sentimental.<br /><br />Read this book. It will open your eyes to things going on in a small country on the other side of the world that you never thought possible. It made me so very grateful for all that I have - the freedoms and the many things which we take for granted that make life enjoyable.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it! Couldn't stop once I started reading!  I can not wait for the next one to come out in June!
B0000033IR|5.0|\\"Good To Me As I Am To You,\\" \\"People Get Ready,\\" and \\"Ain't No Way\\" are some of Aretha Franklin's greatest tunes that are rarely or almost never played on radio.  Buy this CD and listen to what Soul Music sounds like when it is sang by Lady Soul...
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Yes, this is the real deal! It's finally out! It's everything you know and love about Daft Punk. It's a pleasure that even though it has a modern sound, it's not plagued with autotune or huge bass drops. It sounds fantastic and I don't know why anyone wouldn't want this track
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I expected this movie to be ALOT better than it actually was. All the funny stuff in the movie appears in the trailers.
1400069807|5.0|Hands down has got to be the most important book I've read all year. Every page has yellow markers and each new idea is a game changer. Now I know what I'm up against in the store.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|As always, enjoy this type of movie and look forward to more of this type. Pricing was fine for this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book a couldn't even put down  if 1 was bad and 10 amazing then this book is a 11! I loved it . I recommend it for all people ages 10-15
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Hubby never saw this before was curious about it. Since watching it, it is a one of his collection keepers. I do not mind since the music is one of my favorite to listen to! Hubby must have watched this a good dozen times so far.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|There were a number of typos not in the original books, which are a bit distracting while reading. Perhaps if it is possible, to have someone go back and fix them?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The movie is worth the purchase. It have great special effects and follows the Ring triology  fantastically. My only issue is it ends before I really wanted it to....lol...........
B000W965QW|5.0|I felt like I got inside the brain of a nice and regular guy.<br />The book talks about love, aging, not knowing what to do with you life, learning to live with yourself, friendship and music.<br />It's funny all the time and at the same time, very moving.<br />I loved it.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|As a history buff, hubby really enjoyed this. He also has watched numerous other movies about Lincoln and found this most entertaining.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is one of my comfort books.<br />Yes, there is a predictable love story, this is classic chicklit.<br />But the book is really funny and the protagonist is so full of personality and so like a real girl, I can't help but laugh when I read this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|a great sequel to the first game which I loved. worth the download. I cant wait for the third version to be made
B008FC4WA4|5.0|This is just an entertaining story.<br />A nice man gets dragged by his pride to seek vengance of his wife.<br />I love that Nick Hornby lets you feel like you could get inside the brain of a regular guy. His books always feel honest, even when the characters are acting in ridiculous ways.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I think the horse has been beat enough...the movie was a consistant monotone of forever dialog.  I'm sorry thumbs down.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is one game my preschooler demanded I play when I turn on the Kindle Fire. The cube attack mode looks easy at first, then it gets harder and more frustrating for me as I try to keep a step ahead of the cubes. The 60 seconds mode is great too when I just want a fast game.  Very simple.  No instructions really needed.  Great game and approved by my 3 years old.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|WATCH the prequels get insight into each episode or just more viewing pleasure for the Whovian's out there that can't get enough.

0345803485|1.0|I started reading this book to find out what all the fuss was about...I still dont know! I dove into the book and after about 20 chapters (I'm a fast reader), I had to put it down and resign to pick it up again. I can see where the author \\"wanted\\" to go with the backstory of Grey's twisted upbringing and Steele's innocence but them being together just doesn't make sense. I have no idea how there's a trilogy of these books seeing as how the passion had already worn off for me by chapter 26. How much sex can you have before it becomes mundane?! I felt like pulling my hair out after reading the words \\"murmured\\", \\"dryly\\", \\"scolds\\", \\"impassively\\" for the umpteenth time!! Seriously, does this author not own a thesaurus?! anywho, this is my opinion on my short-lived ride on the \\"50 shades of *#&$@ed up\\" train...
B008Q0D9DG|4.0|I love the movie. But why are there no closed captions available on any of your downloads? My husband is deaf. Really, cannot hear. No captions are like no handicapped ramp. Very thoughtless to fail to include something so basic to accessibility. Shame on you Amazon.
0440246008|4.0|This was not the best Lee Child book.  All authors have winners and ho, hum books.  This was good.  I enjoyed it.  Jack Reacher needs to get a job.  Wash his clothes, Learn about computers.  He is beginning to come off as an old bitter curmudgeon.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a great movie! I loved every bit of it. The music was wonderful, and memorable. Anne Hathaway was awesome!
B009APMNB0|4.0|4 stars, it isn't perfect, however, for under a hundred bucks it fixed me up as I was having all sorts of difficulty with one of my monitors, the main one. Didn't do much for the 2nd monitor, though, so it doesn't get a perfect score.<br /><br />Another reviewer suggested buying a better monitor but: \\"I wish that I could, but I can't so I won't\\", is my reply to that.<br /><br />Delivery was quick, setup was easy, and I've used it on two Samsung monitors, one 23\\" and the 2nd a smaller and older model. My pc is running Win7 pro and I'm connected to 2 Canon printers (the 9500 Mkii & pro 100). Before monitor calibration with the \\"X-Rite ColorMunki Smile\\" I experienced problems with brightness between monitor and printer. I'd have to do a test print and make adjustments, after calibration the problem disappeared.
B000MNOX7Q|5.0|Lots of twists and turns in a very well written and thought out script.  I've got to watch this one a few more times.
B009NLC1D6|4.0|When you can look at your biological existence as just a small component of who you are...you are free to make the hard decisions toward your values
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This has been used almost daily by our 7 year old for about 4 months now.<br />It has help up well!<br />I would recommend!
B005EHQGTS|4.0|At last I can play Farmville 2 remotely from my Kindle HD Fire... and access my Quicken and other major software components from my desk top. I think it is great... as soon as I figure out how to get the screen to move the way I want for my Second Life app it will be definitely 5 stars!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't think Suzanne would need to fix any thing because I finish this book in one day! I was so into it I only stopped to get food and drinks! If you know that the movie is good than this book is to die for!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I will say it again. I can only say the same thing over and over.  This Brennan is so different from the TV show.  I love the show and its characters' personalities.  The personalities in the books are boring and this Brennan has emotional difficulties of which I tire.  I like the TV bones and her comrades at the Jeffersonian.  They remind me of the geniuses I worked with in the computer industry.  In the books, you have none of those characters.  The best comparable character is the Canadian detective Ryan and the TV Special Agent Booth.  There is no Angela, Hodges, Cameron, etc.  I wish I could read a book like the TV show.
B004OZZ624|3.0|not that great. it wasn't hard to follow or figure out. it's an average thriller with an average, unoriginal ending.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Just another game.  I did not play it enough to tell you was good and what wa bad. abc - xyz
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I like the game it is very fun. I used to have all of the games for the nintendo DS and they where really fun to. The problem is I cant get the stuff I type in to pop up. So if you get the game and figure it out plesase submit a review telling me how please I will be checking.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Suspensful, original, best drama TV I've seen in years. First time someone has told me I \\"HAVE to watch this show\\" and they were right. I will be buying this series on DVD.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The book was hard to put down!  I liked the ending. I have liked all the Grisham books I have read , but The Painted House.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|After seeing this disc, I'm reminded again of why I went to see this group multiple times in the 70s.  They are so professional and yet have so much fun on stage; every single track is played to the best of their abilities and with intent to entertain.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is very good; video and sound are fully up to expectations.  Highly recommended for any old and new Supertramp fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty cool game...nice graphics and sound affects.  I like the games on here you can do and special tasks...i like it.
1594487154|3.0|I have yet to find a book that has practical insight on this. The search continues for advice and books on this subject.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I recommend reading other books by Ian McEwan before reading &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; to experience the rich full flavor of Ian's writing  in this book.<br />I was left with the question:  why do I read?  I 'do' read for pleasure and comfort.  However--a book which does not have me just dying to discuss it with others does not have the same quality of value to me.  Ian makes me think and grow!<br /><br />The ending of this book was masterful!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Having targeted categories for searches on a non pc device speeds up searches and provides a clean interface. Intuitive layout for easy use.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a great item to get if you have a Voyager Legend.  Sturdy, compact and a big convenience to be able to store and charge your headset.  Wish I thought of the idea! Extremely satisfied.  Once again, Amazon fulfilled and shipped my order quickly.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Could not put it down. As usual feeling a bit of remorse that I did not make the read last longer.  Great mix of intrigue and action.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Anthrax, there were a few records that I had here and there (spreading the disease, state of euphoria, sound of white noise)and I would usually like a few songs and that was it, but I have to admit that this record is good: all around; Belladonna is singing better than ever I kind of like him better than Bush, the songs were crafted really good and there are some nice guitar riffs. The songs sound new which is really hard given all the years that these guys have been making records, they almost sound as it was a new band from Sweeden at times. I do recommend this record.
B000FA675C|5.0|I absolutely love Dan Brown. He does a lot of research to make sure his books have both actual facts and fiction all in one. I will continue to read the Robert Manson series as long as it's written. Haven't been disappointed yet.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so fun I love it more than Mario.So I recommend this game to all those  who are looking for an active game better than mario.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I finally watched this movie, I know I am behind. I look forward to the sequel--new movie coming out next season.<br />.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I had heard so much about the popularity of this series, that, when I saw it bargain priced, I purchased it. It was an enjoyable, if predictable, read with lots of pages. I would have been disappointed had I paid full price for each of these.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Does not work as well as the description leads you to believe. It reduces the space you need a little. It's nit a 40% reduction though. A little disappointed but it does help.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I bought the whole season as a christmas present for my daughter. She had no complaints and liked them very much..
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Always wanted to read this story. What a tear jerker.<br />It was so good. Loved it. I would recommend it to anyone.
0465068367|5.0|This is a little taught aspect of WWII. When I taught this to my high school students they were blown away. None of them had heard about this. It is unfortunate that Iris Chang was so affected by what she wrote about that she took her own life. The Japanese have never even apologized for what happened as far as I know. If you study WWII you need to know about this and Iris Chang's book is the best.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|This second edition of this game us not as good as the first. The challenges are really easy and the challenges are not timed which makes this game really boring
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Just like all children's movies, this one doesn't dissappoint. My daughter really likes this movie and has seen it a few times.
B005ZUR724|5.0|great game and there always seems to be updates every couple months. the staff is excellent at helping with any problems. although some quests will glitch up.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Overall, I think that Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is a great movie. I love the fact that they introduce Obi Wan's master, Qui Gon Jinn, although I wish they would have gone into detail about their relationship ( Read Terry Brook's novel version of The Phantom Menace, this book really establishes how strong of a bond these two men have). I also liked learning about Anakin's childhood, and the difficulties of being born a slave along with his mother Shmi. Not to mention, the Boonta Eve Classic podrace scene, and Darth Maul were awesome! Now, of course I will admit that Jar Jar Binks being an up front character kind of ruined the film, but if you overlook that then I think you will be able to enjoy the movie a lot more. Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is an overall good movie, it begins to tell the tale of the decaying Galactic Republic, and it begins Anakin's journey to become a Jedi, and it should be watched more than once!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I'm a middle aged mom and LOVED this movie!  The characters are great, the plot is original and it's just a cute cute family movie.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie most of us never see the other side of handicapped life.  I though both Helen Hunt and the guy you played Mark were really good in this story.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show. It is refreshing and has just enough drama that the whole family can watch with some limitations for younger children. It is fun and a nice take on all the fairy tales and their characters.
B0091QS88K|3.0|son plays this once in a while. more for younger then 5 to play and keep happy on your trips
0547848412|5.0|I did not see the movie, but I wanted to read the story which won so much praise in itself and later for the rendition as a cinematic masterpiece.  Once i realized the introduction was actually part of the story, I was better able to understand the relationship of the characters.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It keeps my mind busy without pieces missing at the end. You can leave it and come back later. No boxes piling up in game closet..
B000SGSU58|5.0|While I'm fairly new to the Michael Bosch series, this one keeps you guessing all the way to the end. Many twists as just when you think you have it figured out a new fact comes to the fore front and we change direction.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Started out slow, but by the end couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B004EPZ08O|3.0|I was in high hopes for this movie but it left me wondering why they continue to make these movies. The previous four was amazing and I still love watching them but this one left me wanting more from it. It is worth a watch atleast once.
B008IBPMZG|4.0|Great series. The streaming was slow from time to time, but the show is great! It really takes you back in time.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|This is by far Avril's best album yet I listen to this one more so then previous ones and love listening to the songs from the ablum that gets a listen daily. The album is full of heart, soul, and emotions that make you feel the music.
B0064QNS62|3.0|I thought the game was boring and could use a  little bit more polish. This is just my opinion though
B00005JKNC|3.0|This movie is good to see atleast once but I feel that it could of been better. Jim Carrey was good in his role but overall the movie did not leave a lasting impression.
B00BR476TG|3.0|Interesting but I will wait to find the dvd at a discount.<br />Costs more then I am willing to spend!!!
B003WTE886|5.0|This is the ablum that introduced me to Taylor Swift and it has my favorite song of hers &#34;Haunted&#34;. This was a great way to introduce me to this amazing singer and it a great addition to any music collection.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I haven't watched it in 3D yet. I have a friend with a 3D set up but had to take it down for a while so I can't say for sure if the 3D is any good.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|My new favorite game...A perfect copy of the original, and then some! The only issue I had is if you press the back button when it's asking what you meant to type, it locks the yellow box on the screen and can only be removed by restarting the game. Also, after typing your selection, if you press the provided Enter button, it merely drops away the keyboard, doesn't actually enter the word...you must return to the keyboard for that, which is confusing. Otherwise, perfect.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great film in Blue ray! Haven't watched it in 3D yet.<br />I also loaded up the digital download and it works great on my Ipad.
B00BU8QOII|4.0|This movie was caught the viewer's interest from the beginning. It was written well  took the viewer on a journey. It was inspirational an the point was clearly pointed out.
B0054SMIH6|1.0|dont waste your time...matthew mc conaughey just over acts so much it takes away from the rest of the movie,,,,very boring I couldnt even finish watching.
B0011E9LBI|3.0|I do not recommend to be watch with kids.  I didn't realize how many annoying little curse words they use, I guess now that my values have changed I am not a huge fan of this movie anymore; however; I will stand behind number 3.  That is by far the best MIB movie.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This classic sci-fi drama is about as near to perfection as you can get.  Some episodes are more campy and even verging on silly, but most  have you hanging on to your seat!  I have never been a fan of sci-fi, but I am hooked on Who!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Maybe I need to spend more time with it but I've found it a bit difficult to navigate. Some times I want to go straight to a particular verse and I've had difficulties. I would like to type in certain words that are partof a verse and have the one or options come up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely loved catching up with Downton Abbey.  Its sad so many characters have not stuck with the show--in some cases I wish they'd pulled the &#34;Hey Samantha--theres a new Darren living in your house&#34; trick and kept the character alive!--but alas such is life.  Love the upstairs/downstairs story lines and how the two worlds are so intertwined.
B000002IOY|5.0|YEARS OF DECAY comes in the golden years of the classic THRASH band OVERKILL....All the songs are great like the gems TIME TO KILL, ELIMINATION and NOTHING TO DIE FOR...Unfortunately, it´s the last album with the phenomenal guitar player Bobby Gustafsson....if you like the old traditional THRASH METAL played by the old METALLICA you will love this one!!!!! WELL DONE, OVERKILL!!!!!!!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My grandson loves the show and wanted this cd for Christmas also, but I could not find it. Amazon was sold out! We bought this for him for Easter! I love hearing him sing! Wonderful cd for his age group! :0)
B000001DTM|5.0|While i really like THE JOUSHUA TREE, i think ACHTUNG BABY is BY FAR the best U2 album!!!! This one is a complete masterpiece!!!!! The lyrics are UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Bono was at his peak here....The more rock tracks like THE FLY, UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD and EVEN BETTER THAN THE REAL THING are contagious!!!! The ballads like ACROBAT, ONE and WHO´s GONNA RIDE YOUR WILD HORSES are so beautiful that make me cry!!!!!man, this is great stuff!!!!! U2 NEVER created something as inspired as this pearl again!!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Enjoyed it immensely. Extremely long tho, may be worth watching in a couple of sittings. Must for LOTR fans. Get this movie!
B000003TA4|5.0|WOW!!!! This is really a cool, great, inspired, unique, magic music piece.....I remember when this come in the early 90´s, become a cult classic and now, after so many years i hear really a UNIQUE moment for NIRVANA and the music history.....ALL the songs are AMAZING with great raw instrumental and the perfect POP feeling....yes, NEVERMIND is UNBELIEVABLE!!!! THIS IS WITHOUT ANY DOUBT A MASTERPIECE!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Such a courageous boy with physical deformities who steals your heart and the other characters who develop the story.  You ache for Auggie in the beginning and beam with pride for the love of his friends at the end.
B00008WT5C|5.0|I love AC DC, and this classic LET THERE BE ROCK may be my favorite album from this fantastic HEAVY ROCK band!!!!! it´s like a greatest hits album....ALL the songs are among AC DC´s best!!!! man, the cool riffs of the title track, the gem WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE, the fantastic rhythm of OVERDOSE, DOG EAT DOG or BAD BOY BOOGIE.......THIS IS PURE HEAVY ROCK MAGIC!!!!! i enjoy most EVERYTHING this band recorded, but this one is PHENOMENAL!!!! i´m not able to say which AC DC album is their best, but this one may be my favorite!!!!!!!!!YEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It was very entertaining for the entire famly<br />The story was good and the graphics were grate!<br />I could watch it agan and agan
B0029LHW4U|5.0|first of all, i gotta say that i totally love previous AIC albums like the masterpieces DIRT, JAR OF FLIES and FACELIFT.....ALICE IN CHAINS is one of the BEST HEAVY METAL ROCK bands ever!!!! BLACK GIVES WAY TO BLUE is a great great album in par with past albums....Jerry Cantrell is a great lead singer and the new one William Duvall is very good and do some Layne style vocals.....Some songs are among ALICE's best like A LOOKING IN VIEW, LAST OF MY KIND, LESSON LEARNED, CHECK MY BRAIN and TAKE HER OUT.....If you like ALICE IN CHAINS, check this.....A NEW MASTERPIECE!!!!WELL DONE!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome. It's just like owning your own horses. You care for your horse. But it's not only horses there are unicorns and zebras too. I love this game it feels so real.
B00008WT5E|5.0|AC DC is the best HEAVY ROCK band of their kind( please, don´t compare AC DC to LED ZEPPELIN or BLACK SABBATH), and POWERAGE comes from the BON SCOTT period, which i think it´s their best!!!! With Bon on the vocals, in my opinion, they recorded their most inspired tunes....POWERAGE...Well, POWERAGE is a ROCK petard with amazing classics like SIN CITY, GIMME A BULLET, ROCK N ROLL DAMNATION and RIFF RAFF!!!! man, if you never listen to this, do yourself i favour and DO IT!!!! It´s RAW in HIGH VOLTAGE HEAVY ROCK perfection!!!! i can´t skip any song here, they´re ALL amazing!!!! well, it´s AC DC!!!!!it got to be AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Love it so much cant believe they made this a game I was thinking about a month ago that they need to make this a game now that they did I'm so exited
B000001FFR|5.0|ANTHRAX is one of the best THRASH METAL bands ever, and SPREADING THE DISEASE is one of their best albums...It´s also the debut of the great Joey Belladona on the vocals, and he did a amazing job on his first ANTHRAX album....Joey´s voice reminds a lot Bruce Dickinson with a Punk feeling, and that change the band´s sound a lot!!!! All the songs are great like the classic MADHOUSE, LONE JUSTICE, MEDUSA and STAND OR FALL!!!!! if you like the old THRASH style, you will love this one....in fact, almost ALL ANTHRAX albums are great!!!!! GREAT ALBUM!!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book it was funny I loved it!!!!!!!! thank you JEFF KINNEY  FOR THE BOOK  from Amal  Salah
B000WS4PCO|5.0|U2 is a really cool Rock band, and Joshua Tree is their masterpiece!!! While i think Achtung Baby is even better, Joshua Tree is beautiful filled with U2´s finest stuff.....All the songs are great!!!Highly Recommended for every person in the world!!!Masterpiece!!!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Good music especially for Steely Dan fans. It seems like the lyrics have more meaning than previous music Donald Fagen has written with/without Steely Dan.
B00701QVVY|5.0|yes, this is a modern THRASH METAL masterpiece by the great OVERKILL....The last 3 OVERKILL albums are AMAZING!!!!! THE ELECTRIC AGE shows a mature band with unbelievable skills creating THRASH METAL for the new millennium!!!! While the first 5 OVERKILL albums are their best, this new phase is phenomenal!!!!! BLITZ vocals are better than ever, he can scream like a fusion between Rob Halford and Brian Johnson!!!! All the band shines here with instant classics like DROP THE HAMMER DOWN, SAVE YOURSELF, ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTING and the frantic ELECTRIC RATTLESNAKE!!!! TOTALLY GREAT!!!! try IMMORTALIS and IRONBOUND too.....OVERKILL RULES!!!!!!!!!
B00B23O96A|4.0|This CD has some new and some old songs on it. Overall, I would rate it Good to Very good.
B00122V360|5.0|I absolutely love the movie and it has a great soundtrack it's amazing that high grant can sing so good and drew hereunder
B00932A66Y|5.0|Whatever I expected from this movie, I was constantly surprised by twists of plot and character that mostly made sense and worked within the context of the story.  Really enjoyable, funny and thrilling.  Well worth your time to watch.
0486282112|4.0|I have always loved the story of Frankenstein and had seen movies but never read the book. This was very enjoyable to read.
B000025SUE|5.0|This came so fast and in super mint condition! Thank you so much. I had this and lost it and have been bereft ever since--next to Charlie Parker with Strings it is the greatest album of all time!
B007SGM084|5.0|Had heard mixed reviews about this trilogy. Gave it a try and loved the story line. Romance, mystery, sex it had it all.
B000HF702E|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old and she loves watching it.  She's into Home Alone and other movies in that genre and this is entertaining enough for adults if you sit and watch with your kids. Foul language is at a minimum and the kids will laugh most of the way through.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|Butch and Sundance was a compelling western about to highly recognized outlaw figures from our Wild West history.<br />There was a good deal of humor injected into the film which really made the duo a very likeable pair.  I know there was probably a good deal of Hollywood padding in the film but they did a good job in making the guys likeable.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Once you start playing it seems you do not want to start, especially when the is another person in the household playing the same game.
B001P829VY|5.0|Bogart had to be one of the all time great gangsters and tough guys.  Bogart was a really great actor who could play most any part or character but I think the tough guy was the best.  Treasure of the Sierra Madre wasn't so much a gangster film as his others but he did play a pretty good tough guy.
B004SN783M|5.0|Merrell's line of barefoot running shoes has been my entry into the minimalist footwear world. These particular shoes fit my feet like a glove - just as the name implies. I typically buy size 11 (D) shoes, or thereabout, when wide varieties are not available... which is usually the case. Yet with the Merrell Sonic Glove Trail Running Shoe, I wear a size 10. It turns out that 10 is the right size for me. I was blown away by that. I have never had a shoe fit so perfectly in my life, and it is hard to describe how much of a positive difference that makes. Walking, running and playing sports are much more enjoyable. The body of the shoe stretches ever so subtly to accommodate my wide (E to EE) feet, and there is plenty of room on the sole to prevent that part of my foot from &#34;hanging over&#34; the sides (a problem with Reebok minimalist shoes that I have tried on in the past). Bottom line: if you have wide feet, or want to try minimalist footwear (or a different type of minimalist footwear than, say, toeshoes), these Merrell shoes are the best I have encountered. Because these shoes truly fit like a glove, you may want to get a size smaller than you normally wear... or better yet, try them on in a store first. I own several pairs (different colors) because they are so nice.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Absolutely LOVE Lark Rise to Candleford!  I started watching this series on Amazon Prime and have watched it numerous times.<br />It is charming, simple and just makes you feel good.  Neighbors and friends helping one another, people with values and principles.<br />The changes that they see and the lessons they learn can be applied to our lives today (believe it or not).  Just a great, all around, wholesome show!
B0015AARJI|4.0|I bought this for my newly acquired PS3 slim 160GB model, and right away noticed a lesser quality feel plastic right out of the package compared with my controller that came in the box. Since it's an official SONY product, I figured it wouldn't feel like official 3rd party crap. Yes, it could be worse. No, I'm not sure how else to explain besides from saying the pack-in controller plastic is very smooth and jet black, while this product (bought black to match) just feels like a worse build quality with a cheaper plastic.<br /><br />So far everything functions 100%, but it is peculiar and a bit annoying. Oh well, I'll just make someone else use that one hahaha
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It moves right along and keeps you guessing what will happen next.  Some surprising twists and turns and a few really stand-out actors; Maggie Smith of course has the best one-liners and delivers them to perfection. Thomas seems to have the most depth with his ever-changing face (evil, good, cowardly, brave) and the actor does a great job communicating all of the character's flaws and emotions.  Not a fan of Shirley Maclaine's character - just too outrageous to be believable. Don't know if it's her or the writers but she could definitely tone it down.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is awesome even if one doesn't have trouble sleeping.  It is so much fun to mix the different sound possibilities and hear the blends of the different sounds.  And one can save their favorite 'creations'.
1405853115|2.0|There are too many sections that refer to things like cassettes. While many sections of this book are great it needs a serious update. It was first published in 1988, and updated recently, but clearly it was a superficial update.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great app.  Lots of fun.  I quite like being able to change the background colors so that it works well in all kinds of light.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Can't wait for the next segment. The movie is stunning, the graphics are incredible and follows the story line.  Hopefully they will continue the story line.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is by far the best alien show I have seen. Highly recommend it, i can't wait for season 3.
0739378333|4.0|Book was good predictable but the book is an easy read although it is rather large.  I enjoyed it though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like how you have to keep playing to unlock more games. It's pretty addictive. There are some games I enjoy more than others but there are10 that you start with and you can pick and choose when you get enough points.
030726999X|5.0|Great series i'm a dude and I enjoyed it when I didn't think I was these books got me back into reading at 27 years old!
B00BF11UM0|4.0|love the director and her movies. await further movies by catherine bigelow. i await further movies by this  director and her team.
031603441X|4.0|Good book it kind of feels like it drags on at some points with stories that aren't really taht interesting but overall I enjoyed it was just a tad longer than needed.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This movie is well made.  A good one for any Lord of the Rings fan.  I noticed a lot of additions in the movie that were not in the book, but the main story line is correct.  I will be buying the other Hobbit movies as they come out.
1400049628|5.0|Zombies are everywhere highly recomend this book as well as WWZ and 6lbs of flesh.  Great zombie reads this one is in an instruction manual format though so be prepared for that.... Good toilet reading.
B006O5YI7G|5.0|If you are looking for an old time Western see this.  My Dad really liked it @ 87 years old!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great movie for a great price was on a crazy cheap sale and it's the entire collection looks great.  .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can not stop playing this game weather its on my phone or my kindle. I am very addicted to playing this game.Good job.
B001HHDW1O|5.0|No kitchen is complete without it! Definitely a cook book to work up to though! I dove right in with Boeuf Bourgignon, and it was amazing, but difficult, and I should have started simple!

B001NXDSLQ|5.0|This DVD is a must in any music lover's collection. I had to buy this item ever since I saw the movie on TV as a kid. I felt like I needed to show it to friends and family when they visit especially if they've never seen the video footage before!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Seth McFarland you nut!! typical Seth humor, dirty and nasty and just plain F'n funny. Ted does sound like Peter Griffin, dbut that's even funnier! Nutty F'n bear!!

0143112724|5.0|If you love language and the art of writing, and have a sense of humor, this edition is wonderful. Get to know something about the authors and people who worked with them. Illustrations are heartwarming. One of my favorite books in the whole world of books.
B008602KQI|5.0|On Apr. 13th, 2013, I received an unsolicited invitation to Amazon Prime. After reviewing the conditions and protocols, I accepted. My experiences with the service have lasted for a week. I have not reviewed Prime in the past because many  of the erstwhile video sites on the net are not consistent.  Prime is a first-rate provider. The videos are sharp. The care and dedication of professional programmers and conversion artists must be commended. I am a WiFi user.  Prime is able to sustain a reliable connection under fair conditions when it is used on public Wifi.  It peerlessly maintains connections in 5 bar situations.  If you are a viewer of movies, Dr. Who or the new/original programs, you will not be disappointed by breaks, snags or glitches.  Remember: Rule #33---Keep Hope Alive, ZombieLand.
B0047T86G0|1.0|While this is a wonderful dictionary -- or I wouldn't have spent $47 for the Kindle version of it -- I could not access it on my android phone.  What I mean is, I could go page by page, but there was no mechanism by which I could look up a word!  If I put a word in the search field, what I would get is every time that word appeared in the entire dictionary.<br /><br />Someone really goofed on this one.  And when I emailed customer service, they just refunded my money.  I guess there is no fix.  I was told flat out that the dictionary wasn't compatible with my 2011 Kindle Fire, also.  Somebody really goofed on this one.

B004LROUNG|5.0|Great characters, humor, and story.  Kept my interest throughout.  One of those books that you are sorry to reach the last page.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|The story is well written and I was satisfied with the mystery and its solution.  However the real focus of the book is the culture of that surrounds the town.  I've read better mysteries but I really felt like I was knew the culture and people of the village before the book was done.  Had I read this expecting a lot of action I would have been disappointed.  Instead I was treated to a passible story but a wonderful travelog.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I did not see this movie in the theater, but loved all the other Lord of the Rings.  Just need lots of time to watch.  Did not break out the 3D yet, but like I said watched on Vudu Ultraviolet.  One for the collection.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|I'm not a gamer but I played Halo in the beginning. This movie was enjoyable to the point that it was s segway into the games mission and it was interesting to see the academy life of the cadets. There is plenty that could have been in this production but it served it's purpose.
B003MYYJD0|1.0|The band is a joke- the metal clasp sticks straight up-snags everything- ruined a sweater- this is a disaster watch!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Chances are if you were in, or recently out of, high school in the mid to late 1990s you watched one or both of the series aimed at your demographic.  This and Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  The series shared many of the same supporting actors, and even touched on similar themes just in very different ways.<br /><br />By now most people know the overall story.  It is set around a group of teens in New England.  It was very much a teen soap opera that revolved around will Dawson and Joey ever get together, then will Joey choose Dawson or Pacy.  That part of it got tired, and frankly a little old because it was literally dragged out to the very end.  But where the series shined was when it dealt with issues like mental illness, coming out, drug use, adultery and the effects of it, etc.  It was a show that for its time pushed a lot of boundaries, and dealt with subjects that you did not see on prime time TV a lot before that.<br /><br />The discs were just what you got in the individual seasons all in one box.  Apparently the early packaging was really bad.  When I bought this, it basically was packaged so it opened like a book and you had 10 disks stacked together on one side, and 9 on the other.  Not the greatest, but there were no scratches or discs that would not play.  The extra features were pretty sparse.  Some behind the scenes stuff in the first couple seasons, but not much from the later ones. You do get the complete extended edition of the series finale, the best part of which was Jen's storyline.  Apparently some of the music from the series what changed from what was on TV originally.  This happens a lot, especially with older series where there is a lag time between the show airing and the DVDs being put out.  It is due to licensing and there is nothing that can be done of the entity holding the rights does not let the song(s) to be put on the DVD.  I personally did not remember all the songs from when it aired on TV, but I will admit I only watched it casually back then.  But the choice was either replace songs or not put the show out on DVD at all.<br /><br />It is a show that by today's standards is pretty tame and a little cheesy. But if you were a fan of the show then it is definitely worth getting.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Incredible cinemotography, and interesting spiritual dimension, however, it's long and drawn out, not something I would view again.<br />I have explained to others my comment above.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I think that I gave it five stars, a) because it deserves it and b) the writing is so memorial and excellent. It's bittersweet.<br />The things that I dislike, was that it was really sad. But I'm not going to say any spoilers. And, there was a bit of intimacy, but I think the brilliance of the book altogether outdid these small little dislikeable qualities. I love this book, the romance, the humor, and even the bittersweet moments. I recommend it to probably teens and up.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I was very excited to see the new Jimi Hendrix CD being promoted and as soon as it was available I ordered it.  I have not been disappointed at all.  As with many albums, there are the songs that stand out above the rest and others that are just there.  This CD has the same; however the songs that are just there are still great and keep the CD flowing.  I am pleased to be able to hear vintage Hendrix in a new era.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had to read this book to see what all the talk was about.  I enjoyed it because it was different.  However, I'm not sure I will read the books that follow.  One may be enough, but then I may change my mind, who knows??

This one missed the mark for me, but I look forward to seeing what Pink does next.

B00486070K|5.0|I use this with my Late 2010 MacBook Air. (I remember reading mixed reviews of what adapters worked with what models.) With this thing, I removed it from the container, plugged a network cable into the port, connected the USB port, and I was on the wired LAN at work. Do bear in mind that the top speed on this thing is 100 Mbps, not Gigabit, but that's unavoidable over USB 2.0 anyway. Compared to the flaky 54 Mbps (tops) wireless at work, this thing is faster and way more reliable. If you need to use your Air with a wired LAN, I'd highly recommend this.
1449305172|5.0|If you are thinking about creating a tech startup, are currently involved in an early stage tech startup, or advising one, this is a FANTASTIC resource. Read it. Use it. Ask your friends read it.<br /><br />Why? It has actionable information for early stage startups. For example, it includes goals, outlines, and example questions for interviews at each stage of customer development.<br /><br />I will be recommending this book to all the startups I advise, and all pitching companies and the larger startup community at our local New Tech (startup pitch night) events.
B0030MTQNW|4.0|This is a good film that tends to lapse into fits of cheesiness every ten minutes or so. The history is accurate and some of the battle scenes are awe-inspiring and involve thousands of extras. The film is stuffed with great actors and unfortunately a few weak ones (Redford and Ryan O'Neil). The movie has a very structured cadence and unfolds in a direct linear way but it works well. Some of the death scenes are laughably bad (involving muttered 'last words' followed by the infamous 'head slump'). Anyway, it's worth watching if you dig the history.

0679804021|1.0|It needs to be made abundantly clear on this listing that this &#34;Treasure Island&#34; is NOT the novel in its original form.  It is abridged and watered down almost beyond recognition.  I was extremely disappointed upon receiving this book in the mail.  Upon inspection in person, I realized this is a &#34;children's&#34; version.  As a mom, I still want my child to read this book in its original form.
B009S33I68|4.0|\\"We Were Soldiers Once...And Young\\" is the account of how close Hal Moore as well as his soldiers came to being massacred. The numbers are spine-chilling: In four days of battle --- with hostile forces at times as near as 75 feet to the American line --- 234 Americans passed in battle. In this extraordinary minute-by-minute record, you get to know these soldiers. And sadly: You see every man die in battle.<br /><br />Keep In Mind the state of one's affairs. Americans originally were advisers in Vietnam; they had never battled the hostile forces. Moore was a career Army: West Point, Korea, advanced studies in fast-moving, guerrilla combat. In June of l965, he began instructing his unit for conflict in Vietnam. In August, the Army removed each and every one of his newly-acquired second lieutenants. In August, all enlisted men that had 60 days or fewer of service were taken out of the 7th Cavalry. the result was that when Moore and his men get under way to Vietnam, they had by that time been deprived of 100 of their most experienced soldiers.<br /><br />The distinguishing characteristic between an under-trained company, that withstands brutal combat, and one that turns out to become legendary in its loss, is leadership. Take Into Consideration a few of the methods Moore managed his soldiers. He told his unit:<br /><br />--- \\"Only first-place trophies will be displayed, accepted or presented in this battalion. Second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield, and death for the individual in combat.\\"<br /><br />--- \\"Decision-making will be decentralized: Push the power down. It pays off in wartime.\\"<br /><br />--- \\"Loyalty flows down as well.\\"<br /><br />--- \\"I check up on everything. I am available day or night to talk to any officer of this battalion.\\"<br /><br />Before the fight began, James Galloway was paying attention to Moore's men shaving as he heated water for coffee one day before the battle. Moore passed by. \\"We all shave in my outfit--- reporters included,\\" he barked. Galloway right away repurposed his coffee water for shaving.<br /><br />Moore arrived in to Ia Drang on the front helicopter. He led his unit into battle from the line of battle. When he would catch sight of soldiers from a separate company beginning to pull one of his deceased men out of a foxhole with a harness, he would bark, \\"No you won't do that. He's one of my troopers, and you will show some respect. Get two more men and carry him to the landing zone.\\" When it was over, and it was time for Moore to turn over command, he requested a full battalion formation. One soldier recalls, \\"We stood in formation, with some units hardly having enough men to form up. Colonel Moore spoke to us and he cried. At that moment, he could have led us back into the Ia Drang.\\"<br /><br />Moreover managed to lead by example back home while he and his men wee on the battlefield. His wife went to as many funerals as she was able to attend. And when he got back to the U.S. in April 1966, he visited the families of his deceased soldiers. One family believed his call would last a few minutes. He visited five hours. He also went with the family to pay a visit to the burial place, and there he asked to spend some time in solitude, bending in prayer and remembrance.<br /><br />This account --- the story of the connection of an officer to the soldiers he watched over and the families that sent those young soldiers to be in his charge --- is why you need to read this book. If you are a manager responsible for employees or if you are a parent fighting the good fight of raising your children, you above any other readers will be capable of reading through the darkness and death and know why Moore's soldiers fought and died for him.<br /><br />If you are ever be in Washington, D.C., the names of the men who died in battle at Ia Drang can be seen on the third panel to the right of the summit, Panel-3 East, of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. When lived in Baltimorefor seven years I once took my boys to that wall and we stood in silence and awe. I encourage you to do the same and to read this book.
1455869910|5.0|Terminal cancer when you're 16, it sounds awful but somehow with John Green at the helm, it isn't. I loved, no, that isn't enough. I LOVVVVVVVED this book. Green is a master at emotionally connecting the reader with the characters.  The main characters, Hazel Grace & Augustus Waters' wit, dark sense of humor and obvious love for one another makes it hard to put this book down. Fault is a touching love story about two people who meet unexpectedly at a *cancervania* (clever!) self help meeting and quickly find they do not want to live a life without one another, no matter the unavoidable outcome. It's a modern day Romeo and Juliet and I'm intrigued by this author and can't wait to read more from him. He's a fellow Hoosier to boot! Thank you for writing such a beautiful and touching novel. It's been quite some time since I read a book with a great ending and dude, you nailed it. Job well done.

B00B2YH7BS|4.0|I saw a trailer for this movie about a year or so ago. I never heard anything else about it. Then, I see it on Amazon and bought it. Good price. I watched it and was blown away by the music history and behind-the-scenes look in this film. The walk down memory lane seen though the eyes of this living breathing studio... before Pro Tools® and the digital era. Whether  you are a amateur recording enthusiast or a professional OR if you just have a real passion for the older music and the time and passion it took to create them-- this film is for you!

B0064W65SO|5.0|Frank Miller writing Batman, what more can a person ask for. Miller truly taps into the inner workings of Batman's mind. The obsession and drive for justice is depicted as a desire and a means for survival. The need for a Batman is felt on both ends, Bruce's and Gotham's.

B000OZ0NXA|1.0|I liked the Tom Cruise movie and decided to give the Jack Reacher series a try.  I was surprised at how bad this book was.  Perhaps the series gets better as it goes on, but I won't risk reading another of these books.  I thought it failed on numerous levels.<br /><br />Most importantly the fundamental premise of the book was just ridiculous.  The huge secret plot at the heart of the book is just laughably stupid - incredibly expensive, sure to attract attention and ultimately not even technologically possible.<br /><br />Also, as you might expect from a book like this there's a lot of talk about guns, but the author obviously knows nothing about firearms other than what he's seen in movies.  He has a .22, a very weak small-caliber round, completely blowing a man's face off.  In another scene a man is literally blown through the air and out of his shoes by a .44 magnum.  He also subscribes to the \\"room clearing\\" myth of the shotgun, i.e. that pellets spread out in a wide cone destroying anything in front of the gun (in reality a typical shotgun pattern is about 5\\" wide at 5 yards and still only 18\\" at 30 yards).  The weapon his hero chooses is a Desert Eagle .44 magnum pistol - a comic book gun almost 12\\" long and weighing 5 lbs. (loaded) that has no real world application beyond (perhaps) the eccentric sport of big-game pistol hunting.<br /><br />The author's description of action scenes is confused and hard to believe.  There's a scene where he has Jack Reacher killing bad guys armed with guns using only a sap and an knife, but there's no clear explanation of how he's able to close with them without getting shot.  In the same scene the author seems to have Jack carrying a knife in one hand and a sap in the other, but somehow he's also able to carry a shotgun.<br /><br />The characters appear unrealistic in their actions.  There's insufficient reason to explain Jack Reacher's bizarre vagrant lifestyle or how he supports himself financially.  The romantic relationship is totally unbelievable - why would a beautiful female police officer instantly throw herself at Jack Reacher, a complete stranger who is homeless, under arrest for murder and wearing thrift shop clothing?<br /><br />Ultimately I was never excited by the action scenes, never made to care about the characters and didn't feel like the plot was remotely plausible.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Very interesting game. It is what I call the complete spelling adventure for kids. My daughter cannot get enough of it .
1609611543|5.0|Wow this book was an eye opener. I tried to avoid reading it since I am European and love my bread. At least two of my meals consisted of bread. Working out and watching calorie intake did not get rid of my belly that slowly got bigger. That is the only fat I carry and it is dangerous. After reading this book I felt shocked and angry. Now we are ready to make changes, I gave all my wheat containing food away and one week into this life style change I am not missing the wheat. The cookbook for greater variety is recommended.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Victor Hugo would be proud to see how his lengthy and detailed story was depicted in this movie.<br />After reading Les Miz and knowing all the gritty details, it made the movie make more sense. Still,<br />the movies stands alone quite well.<br />I thought the acting and singing were quite remarkable. It is so hard to sing through intense emotion,<br />but Hugh, Russell, and Anne offered wonderful, heartfelt performances.<br />This is a movie I will watch time and time again and love it every time!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is truly the greatest story I have heard in such a long time, maybe ever.  The guy goes 40 years before anyone finds him!  He is virtually unknown in one country yet larger than Elvis in another; simply amazing.  I recently saw Rodriguez in concert and it was truly a moving experience.  He is one of the humblest people you will ever experience.  This is an incredible story which everyone should see.

It's a classic but I won't read it again.

B00B99KJR0|3.0|The app worked.  It's an episodic game with based on the &#34;Bejeweled&#34; style of match 3 or more things in a row. to advance levels.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|I can't imagine why this book has had so much hype.  It is simplistic and sounds like a grade school Sunday school lesson
B00B22IJXK|2.0|There are several better photo editing apps out there.  Keep on looking. The image used in their logo/thumbnail isn't readily doable with the app.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very fun game. Need more unites and add sea base unites to that would be pretty cool to please add it
B004SIIBGU|2.0|It has lots of trouble logging me into my Facebook account.  I find it much easier to just connect to FB through the browser app.
1439102813|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me. Our mother died of Alzheimer's and not too long after that, I saw signs in my husband. So now I'm in this adventure again, and the book really helped me get my priorities straight and gives me courage to go forward. I recommend it to anyone and everyone! The title is perfect!
B0037LXTUW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for a group.  The graphics on the cards are very imaginative.  Guessing which card you should play depends heavily on the personality of the player giving the leading clue.  Highly recommended.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My five year old great niece likes it and has figured out more games<br />that she can do on it
B008458O3S|5.0|This game keeps me coming back to work on the next level.  The solutions to each round get harder as you progress.  It reminds me of logic diagrams and flow charting from my computer days.  Definitely recommend getting this app.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I love this app and use it every day. I think the upgrade is more complicated then it needs to be.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Since this is so &#34;popular&#34; i had to have it!  ordered for a friend for her birthday after she lost her original.
B008I3RARW|4.0|Easy to play, even for a novice like me. A fun way to pass the time. could use better sound effects
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I really liked the book.  That said I accept that a movie can never have as much information in it as a book (unless it is a very short book), and that movies are visual representations of what goes on around a character, and most books tend to look inside the character - thus the translation from books to film has an inherent flaw that will always be there.  That didn't stop me from wanting to see this film, because, c'mon: you just want to SEE the boy on the lifeboat with the tiger from the moment you start to read that section of the book.  In that this movie succeeded very well.  Special effects are getting better and better, and where-as in Jumanji, the CGI animals pulled you out of the movie - these succeed in being believable.  All in all a pretty faithful adaptation, with some very beautiful visuals.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I try to play this game and go to &#34;room 6&#34;, looking for the candles, however the clue screen covers up one candle, so NO One can win this game and move on to another room!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|.... this movie is hands down better than the older one with Sylvester Stallone.  Better story, better acting, better effects, no comic relief characters (sorry Rob Schneider), better villan (sorry Armand Assante .... well, really what were you thinking taking that role?).<br /><br />Karl Urban does a satisfactory job in the title role - but there is not much to work with there.  Olivia Thirlby's character, however is what the movie is all about, and where the interest was for me.  Cool development.<br /><br />Liked it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I needed. Keys are large and easy to read. The calulator was also easy to use. Had no problems downloading.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Ok, I am an adult and I don't have kids ... but I like these movies :P<br /><br />This one was pretty good, with a fair bit of nostalgia for me with cameo's by the arcade games I used to play after school.<br /><br />Well worth seeing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a great show.  There so many plots going on at the same time.  It was great to watch on my Kindle fire,
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I didn't understand at first why everyone was talking about this series.  Until I started the first book, I couldn't put it down.  I'd hurry home from work so I could read somemore.  This series is CRAZY with descriptions, should give husbands lots of ideas.......
B005LAIIKI|5.0|awesome movie! great story line . I rented it and watched it several times. I think this is the best movie. I liked kill bill but this was way better. A lot of action and kept me on the edge of my seat!
0385349947|5.0|It is funny, irritating, amusing and motivating!<br />After many years of whispering discussions , leading women and women who wish to lead may speak about it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a GREAT game, a real time killer and something that you can play anywhere. The game is relaxing and really something that I think anyone will love!
0385535147|5.0|Some of his last books I found a bit less thrilling than his older books. The Racketeer is a MUST read if you like this genre.<br />Informative, thrilling, and highly entertaining, I just kept reading it.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|What I use on my phone, on my pc and on my tablet now! Great security system! Having it linked with email address seems nice!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|First off, I bought this book for my kindle after watching the first 2 books play out as a TV series. So, naturally there were some continuity issues, but they were so minor that you could easily read on without any difficulty whatsoever. Also, I was extremely pleased about how this author isn't afraid to kill off some main character that everyone loves (as mentioned by a previous reviewer). This is in such a STARK contrast (haha, play on words) to other series I have read where the heroes face their demise countless times without so much as a scratch on them. With this series, Martin isn't afraid to do what every other author I've ever read does, all the while keeping you on the edge of your seat trying to guess what's coming next. This is an absolute masterpiece in terms of the complexity of all the characters and events, and I can't help but marvel at how well everything/everyone is interwoven in a perfectly meshed masterpiece. It's definitely not a book for some light reading, but for a reader like me, who thinks that all good books are too short, this book was pleasing in that it actually took me some time to get through it.<br />  All in all, this is an amazing series that I will definitely be continuing as soon as I can buy the next book. Get this book. You will not be displeased in any way. You can thank me later.
B005HSL626|5.0|LOL IT gets me giggling every time! Gotta get those fruit, and miss the bombs.. I look like a crazy woman going after them! :D Lots of fun!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This is one of the most watchable shows I've ever seen.  The dialogue and the plots always draw me in. And great chemistry between the characters, especially Harvey and Mike. The show focuses more on the office scenes than on the courtroom, which is fine by me.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|should have bought the full version.. Oh well, fun to play and I think my nephew is kicking my butt..he is playing on his kindle and he's totally better than me LOL
B00992CF6W|5.0|In my opinion, minecraft is the best game ever. My cuz and I made a lot of awesome stuff. I recommend minecraft to everyone.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I have no clue wth I am doing with it..but my little 10 year old nephew loves this game so I am happy!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|What better than I expected, we renteded it for the kids and everyone loved it<br />I would recommend this to any family
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Excellent!  I was so engaged that I did not want to put it down.<br /><br />If you love the Irish you will love this book.
B001L51RQE|5.0|Saw this concert when it was in the States.  Love the sound and Video.  I would see them again if possible.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I bought it for my wife not expecting her to much the songs that are in Hawain. To my surprise she likes them as well as the ones in English.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Ahh...Baldacci...usually it's very cat 'n mouse chase, however, in this book Baldacci ties in a different angle: a teenager.  It's yet another good, fast paced book where you keep on reading just so you can find out &#34;who dunnit&#34;.
B00BVVA138|5.0|I usually don't take the time to review anything on Amazon, but I feel compelled after giving this album a few listens. To put it simply, this album is downright incredible. I personally think it even surpasses Alive or Just Breathing and I don't say that lightly considering Alive or Just Breathing is/was my favorite album of all time. I will admit that I'm a sucker for most everything Jesse Leach does. The man has such passion and sincerity in his voice and I love the positive message within his lyrics. Didn't love Seemless as much as his harder stuff, but in my opinion, nearly everything he has applied his vocals to has been nothing short of amazing. It feels as if he's breathed new life into a band that was slipping into mediocrity.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Howard was an amazing singer. Hell, he was the one that got me into \\"heavier\\" metal when I listened to The End of Heartache, which started my progression toward listening to death, black and all other flavors of metal, but when I got Alive or Just Breathing and heard Jesse's growls, screams and especially his melodic singing, I fell in love. Something about what he says and how he says it really spoke and still speaks to me. His obviously deep passion towards the words he speaks and the authenticity with which he conveys those words are a big part of what makes him so marvelous. I've been hoping for his return to heavier music for a while. The Empire Shall Fall was the first gleam of hope in that respect and while that band is extremely awesome, it just wasn't the same as his past with KSE in my opinion. Same went with Times of Grace (and yes I know that Adam D produced and plays in band). I love both of those bands a ton, but they just didn't seem as great as the original KSE to me.<br /><br />So if you have any reservations about buying this album because of how soft and sort of bland KSE had been sounding lately (I know I did) or maybe even because you liked Howard better, know that this is definitelyworth every penny. It's like Alive or Just Breathing with better and faster drums and better vocals since Jesse's range seems to have broadened over the years. Some songs he sounds just like Howard. Other times he sounds like Phil from All That Remains. He can sometimes sound like other great singers while still keeping true to his own style. I was also blown away at the fact that there was a lot of quick double bass and even blast beats. Didn't think KSE would produce a heavier album like this after their last album. They seemed to be moving to the softer side like most heavy bands seem to do as they age and become famous (Cough, Mastodon). So it's nice to hear a band move away from the more commercial, soft stuff and back to being a bit harder and faster. I honestly figured that this would just end up being another Times of Grace album (which wouldn't necessarily have been a bad thing), but I was ecstatic to find that I was completely wrong in my assumption. This collection of songs is their return to their time of grace (sorry, had to be done) while still producing something seemingly fresh with faster and heavier tracks.<br /><br />So whatever reason you may have for not purchasing this latest album from Killswitch Engage, stop thinking and just get it. You won't regret it a bit. I know I haven't.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I wish I could give this 5 stars , but I can't access the extra content. The movie itself is excellent - one of my favorite films ever. However, I can't play any of the extras (deleted scenes, short films, etc.); it just won't work. I have no idea why. I'm using Cyberlink PowerDVD on my PC. If anyone knows a fix or has this same problem, can they help me with this? THanks.<br /><br />Edit - I realize this is probably a problem with my software. Contacted support to see if they can fix it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|so awesome to have all the Indy movies in one box set. Watch one almost every day. Great sound and video.
0920668372|5.0|When my girls were young they brought this book home from the school library. They told me the librarian had read this to them and they should take it home to let me read it to them and it would probably make me cry. Yep, she was right!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|AWESOME REALLY SCARY TO I POOPED MY PANTS SO WORTH 99¢ REALLY BUY ILUV IT I HOPE THEY COME OUT WITH PART 2
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am an avid fan of Michael Connelly's books and have read just about all of them.  The Black Box, his latest in the Bosch series is a great read.
030758836X|5.0|Amy and Nick's 5the wedding anniversary is now, and all seems happy and well that morning, until Nick comes back home after a neighbor's phone call claiming the front door is open and their cat is setting on the front steps. Nick finds the house in shambles, and signs of a struggle. He calls the police and his nightmare begins. Amy is the \\"Amazing Amy\\" from the books her parents have written, and Nick is the \\"boy-next-door\\" perfect husband. How could anyone accuse Nick of even hurting his wife? The book goes back and forth with each characters perspective. Two psychotic people in a controlled and manipulated marriage brings a creepy, bizarre, terrifying and page turner book. This is the most brilliant piece of work I have read yet this year. It will no doubt be my favorite 2013 read. I can't wait to read more of her work. Adult situations and language. What an amazing book to read. I just couldn't put it down and get it out of my head for days. 100 stars for me.
B000000OSE|5.0|The USE YOUR ILLUSION albums, both 1 and 2, are COMPLETE MASTERPIECES!!!! Both are filled with inspired furious AMAZING ROCK songs, going from Punk to Metal to Blues.....IT`s AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!WELL DONE, GUNS N ROSES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!
B00A8LYYI0|1.0|As the headline says, this blu-ray-disc is NOT &#34;all region&#34; as advertised!<br />I feel cheated... and as amazon.com seems not to care (I gave them feedback twice before this review), I can't trust them for item details anymore, means I won't buy from them any longer...
B000000OQY|5.0|Well, the half part recorded alive is really fun with cool rock songs like MOVE TO THE CITY, RECKLESS LIFE and the great AEROSMITH cover MAMA KIN....the second acoustic half got the HUGE HIT PATIENCE, the great USE TO LOVE HER and ONE IN A MILLION!!!!! if you like ROCK N ROLL, you may like EVERYTHING from the GREAT GUNS N ROSES!!!!!!!!!!!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|This was a great movie-funny, clean, cute. It was in my opinion, the best ice age movie yet. More Sprat, more humor, and a quirky and engagingly creative storyline.
B000000P17|5.0|This album ROCKS!!!! i think is a great collection of Punk Rock songs recorded by the GREAT GUNS N ROSES, on a period in time when GUNS was the king of the HEAVY ROCK WORLD!!!!!(the early 90´s)All the songs are AMAZING, like NEW ROSE, AIN´t it FUN, BLACK LEATHER and DOWN IN THE FARM!!!!!! GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!!!
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|Beautiful setting; beautiful people; great story.  Truly a classic and one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.  Grace Kelly was a gorgeous woman.  I was told that the roads she races around in the movie are the very ones she had the accident on that killed her.
B000000OSG|5.0|If you ask me which USE YOUR ILLUSION is better, i really can´t answer....Both are AMAZING inspired moments from one of the coolest HEAVY ROCK bands EVER!!!!!!!!!BOTH USE YOUR ILLUSION RULES!!!! like APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, those ROCK pearls are TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!WELL DONE, GUNS!!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This was a very good read.  It was creative and unique and kept my attention.  Enjoyed it, and no typos!!
B005T87QCI|4.0|Easy download as always, Fun to play and keeps one's attention to keep playing more. Was reasonably priced and so were the combo packages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find this particular game most enjoyable.the graphics are good and the options are excellent. I would reccomend this he TO everyone
B005LAIIS0|5.0|Great survivalist film of men against nature.  True to form though, nature usually wins.  Liam Neeson plays a good part and really keeps the suspense alive at a brisk pace. Recommended movie for those who would like to take camping trips in the wilderness
B00AHSF4AQ|3.0|Amazon has this listed under 3D if you view the list on your smart TV.  This is not the 3D version!  So... I now own a few copies of this HD movie.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great movie showing the intricate and secret goings on behind the scenes that most Americans have no idea are really happening.  I would bet that the majority of people have no idea of what really goes on in our background government operations and the things that occur to keep our country strong.  I am not a big flag waving military advocate but I do appreciate the efforts and dedication of our fighting forces and their contribution to keeping our country safe. This movie is a great example of stealth operations and an edge of your seat thriller. (However, the end outcome is no secret, just watch the news)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is super good but I started crying, it's so sad.  :(  otherwise it was great.....worth the money, totally.........  love it, especially the end. So cute.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|This was a very exciting film mixing our old west with a taste of our possible future. Though a bit far fetched it is fun fare for for old and new. Pretty good story line and seeing Olivia Wilde is a definite added bonus.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Downloaded to my Kindle. Really fun. Can make a lot of cool things. Lot of fun levels. Makes you think
B0084IG7KC|5.0|A great fantasy delving into a bleak future.  Good action yarn with a few twists to keep you interested.  Casting is quite good compared to trying to inject some Hollywood superstar in the role.  A really enjoyable film.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I like that you do not have to buy anything to keep playing. You get a new heart every 8 minutes which allows you to play. A lot of free games now require you to spend money to be able to keep playing.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|best alaram ever since I lost my phone its worked pretty well for me and probably will work for others
B005LW5J9O|2.0|i found it not very interesting and not well written for my taste. there are some useful historical elements, but not enough. the style of writing was not engaging for me.
159335648X|4.0|This is my introduction to the Reacher series and it didn't disappoint. I'll be ordering more in the series soon.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|This carrier protects the kindle with protective padding. Fits Kindle Fire and the E6 fits well also. You could drop the kindle and the protective cover would protect the kindle.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I can't believe they're making a movie over this sad excuse for a story. It's dry & has a painfully uncreative ending. Pretty sure I wasted a perfectly good day of my life.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Wasn't a big Timberlake fan until this CD.  Every cut  is brilliant.  It will be a critically acclaimed piece of work.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Worst first:  I have to find a new case or carrying situation because I don't want to leave this stylus at home.  This is a good problem to have.  If a device, or accessory, is good enough to make you start new habits, then it has succeeded.  The stylus is responsive and easy to hold for long use.  It can be used at many angles, and is precise enough for art on procreate as long as you don't mind zooming in and out frequently on your work.  It is good for writing, and also good for navigating and gaming.  I had a Kuel pocket stylus before this, and it was great, but from day one it was obviously wearing out.  This stylus is holding up much better and after many hours of use, the tip is as good as new.<br />No regrets, great buy!
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Mars is uber-talented and generates high energy.  This is a terrific CD.  Run Away Baby is an all-time great and my favorite cut on the CD.
0316069434|5.0|Another Harry Bosch novel that keeps you guessing right up till the end.  Michael Connelly always manages to keep it fresh.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I laughed, cried, and smiled.  I was in Ireland with Jamie and Lily.  Great story and well written.  Anxious to read more from this author.
1457514508|3.0|The author sent me a note saying the book was \\"written hopefully to be developed into a movie or TV show.\\"  Ok that makes sense because I found THE GORDONSTON LADIES DOG WALKING CLUB by Duncan Whitehead to be choppy like for a commercial over and over. I thought this was some kind of new detective story, but it isn't real, just some friends that get really luck to find out anything. Random luck.  It was hard to care for these folks.  At first we received pretty good back ground, then it stopped, the human side that is. Interesting premise that falls short. Nice French Bulldog on the cover art.<br /><br /> NOTE: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
1780721676|5.0|great book, tells you everything you need to know about the 5-2 fast diet. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good diet...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for any age and it should be downloaded on any device and played everyday by everone
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wonderful game, even though it isn't as updated as the other versions. I'm glad to see it IS being updated. Overall, good job!
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is perfect on a kindle fire because it is almost the only free texting app kik is amazingly awesome
B005J7K950|5.0|Giorgio Moroder's music is amazing, and combined with the black & white artistry of the film, it all comes together for a great movie.  Not for everyone, that's for sure, but if you like 'quirky' and full of music, this is it.
B007SGM084|4.0|The first one was slow in the beginning but eventually got better. The second was really good with some suspense and I'm currently on the last and so far it's been just as good as the second. I can't seem to put it down.
B0001XAS2G|5.0|Without a doubt. Al Stewart was one of the most talented song writers of the 1970's. His songs remain as timeless and as relivant then as they do today. His haunting melodies such as ;Song On The Radio,;Year of the cat.....<br />On the Border.  Timeless Skies Arcadian Skies&, Time Passages....<br /> That stay in your mind.  Like  \\"Song on the Radio\\". Flying Socerry<br /><br />His lyrics and melodies will paint images in your Minds Eye. Through his Music he can take you to places unkown.  Yet in some way.

075669812X|5.0|According to my 5 yo... this is the best book ever!  He carries it around and mainly looks at the pictures.  It did come with a Lego figurine.  I would buy on Amazon vs. at a retail store... much cheaper and the figurine will be in the book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi my name is Nana an  the game Subway Surfers is the best game I ever played than just sit there and take pictures with  the camera. Well I still do that, but I just don  take as many as I use to. But Subway Surfers is the best especially the Sydney one.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was really, really great. I would definitely watch it more than once. Highly recommended to anyone that is a fan of Indie movies.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Loved it. I plan on keeping it by my side so I can practice Gratitude every day.<br />I loved The Secret and The Power too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cute and entertaining. graphics are great. the games progression feels a little slow at times but still fun. highly recommend it to any horse lover.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is a matter-of-fact account of Sledge's experiences while fighting in the Pacific in WWII.  Poignant and compelling.  Definitely worth the read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story was a good HEA tale. Two wounded souls find each other and love after thinking they could live without it.
B0068THAGY|4.0|I missed this when released in theatres and had been waiting to catch it and glad I finally did. I thought it was a very good movie and enjoyed watching it.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|With a new baby on the way, who is the first child, its time to get the Disney library going. What child doesnt grow up with Disney movies.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I purchased a Microsoft Surface Pro a few days ago, and wanted something more secure and reliable than the built-in WiFi for network connections at times. The reviews of this product were favorable, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The sole port on the Surface Pro was USB 3, so having an Ethernet dongle compatible with that seemed like a good idea. My home's network backbone is gigabit, so there would be a chance that I'd see improved performance on USB 3 over USB 2 dongles.<br /><br />Oh, my - did I. Just for the purposes of testing the speed of the interface, I copied some 1 GB media files from my Win 7 desktop to the Surface Pro's SSD. I consistently saw speeds (and corresponding copy times) of greater than 110 MB per second for the entire transfer. Doing the math, I realized that's near the theoretical maximum of gigabit connection speeds. Truly and consistently awesome speeds. That's precisely what I wanted in a hard-wired Ethernet device.<br /><br />It was also trivial to install on my Win 8 Surface Pro. I plugged it in and it immediately worked. No driver CD, no \\"checking Windows Update\\", nothing.<br /><br />If only all PC products were this easy to use and were as powerful! I highly recommend for those of you who get a new Win 8 Ultrabook (meaning no Ethernet port in most cases) and want a hard-wired network option in your bags of tricks. I'm actually considering getting another \\"just in case\\" - the product is that good in my opinion.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|At times the author went off on very long tangents!<br />I kept reading despite sometimes not understanding everything<br />I read.  I cried at the end<br />I give a 5 star rating
030758836X|2.0|So many bad cliches and tricking the reader made me cringe through most of the book. Also, the characters were completely unbelievable. Admittedly, it started as a page turner, but then when she pulled the ole and-then-I-woke-up, I lost interest.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was very disappointed by this book. It seemed to get great reviews and I was looking forward to a great read but it was more or less a series of climaxes without a whole lot of direction.  85% of the story was about the trial and then the last 15% was 3 more stories in one as if the author didn't know how to end it? Bizarre. The characters didn't have much dimension to them either.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love that Mitch Albom's books are written in such a way that they're easy reads with deep meaning. The more he writes, the better his books get. If you enjoy any of his works, you will enjoy this book as well.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I was unsure what to expect from \\"Mr. Penumbra's\\", and quite pleasantly surprised by an engaging plot, quirky characters and interesting locations. If I have a criticism, it would be that perhaps the whole could have been a bit more developed, s slightly richer tale. That being said, I'm certainly not disappointed, and would recommend \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" to most of my friends.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed this book, good read.  Kept me reading and interested, good development of the characters.  Would read more in the series.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|What a story I enjoyed it a lot. Some slang was hard to read but once I got to know the characters it all just flowed.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Seriously this is a great way to waste good times with your little boy or girl or just your self improving your ability's to show others just how freaking cool it is! EJOY THIS much
B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun little puzzler game; easy to pick up, hard to put down at first.  I've logged an hour or two crowning each challenge.  Pick it up, it's a dollar well spent.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I love this now! at least i have 75GB for now for the next 1 in a half years, when they try to collect the monthly i hope i still find the service useful! Maybe by then there will be a massive improvement with Google drive and i won't need one or the other! But until then drop box is the sheez!
B000063JZQ|5.0|I am getting back into the theater after an eighteen year hiatus, and needed a couple of monologues for auditions.  I thought, what better than Macbeth and Shakespeare?  I settled on the infamous dagger speech, and got No Fear's Macbeth so I could understand it, because, frankly - it goes over my head.  Also rented Polanski's movie from the library and popped that baby in with the subtitles on, yes, because it goes over my head, and watched that for maybe my third time in 20 years.  And it was terrific.  But then a funny thing happened.  As I started to research the piece, I began to crave the film.  I started watching it again and again, and the more I researched Macbeth, the more I fell in love with the film!!  I have become obsessed with it.  And it is because of the QUALITY of the filmmaking.  The locations, all of that - mood, ambiance, tone...sure.  All said, all great...but boy, do I love the actors!!  Lady Macbeth and Banquo are just as perfectly cast as Macbeth himself, and all of the other minor characters peppering the film.  The faces in this film are terrific, and again, the more familiar one becomes with the movie, the more one notices all of the fine intricacies that detail the film.  I love a good movie where it actually gets better with repeated viewings, and man-oh-man is this one of them.  You just can't get any better than Polanski's Macbeth - you really can't.  When they say \\"They don't make them like this anymore,\\" they mean films of this caliber.  I've gone over the Shakespeare movies since this film, and frankly they stink.  Too much lighting, too much editing, no mood or tone or even realism or real passion.  I can't stand them.  Give me Polanski's version, any day.  This is so much better than any Shakespeare film adaptation that it is ridiculous.  Folks, honestly, there's the Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth from the late Sixties era, man, and then it all just sucks.  I love this film, and I fell IN love with the film over a course of repeated viewings.  Now I'm obsessed for it, and the quality of the picture.  So much so that I threw my hands up and stopped renting it and decided to go out of my budget to actually purchase the DVD.  And I only buy DVDs that I know I'm going to watch - and trust me, you will be grateful to have this in your catalog.  It is borderline perfection.  Again, one must state the obvious: They just don't make 'em like this anymore.  This is what film is for.  Timeless and beautiful, this is one for the ages!!  10 Stars.  A+++viewings.

B005I6EU7U|4.0|I really like this cover. Its attractive - reminding me of novels from long ago.It does what its supposed to do -protects your screen.It feels good in my hands when i read. Now I dont have daydreams of my kindle falling. I travel with it to and from work, so far its durability is not in question. I am not disappointed.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really did not know exactly what this book was about. I did not see the movie but it got such rave revues I wanted to read the book. So glad I did!  I couldn't put it down and am really anxious to see the movie when it comes out on DVD.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie and I ended up really liking it. The graphics are great. The story is good. There are some really silly lines here and there. Rawr.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've been hooked on this show since a coworker of mine told me about it.  If you're into early 1900s, then this is definitely a series you should look into.  Can't wait for season 4!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It's a captivating story, well written. The best spent money on a SiFi book!<br />I am looking forward for the FOX movie.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|For me, this was a very predictable and overly long movie.  It may play better for children as the animation is good and they are already familiar with some of the characters.  It is basically a good versus evil story with all of the good guys coming together to battle evil.  It's an okay movie.  One question, why does Santa Claus have a Russian accent?
B004SIPA4G|5.0|This is a awsome series of short films all intertwining into eachother. Maiking this a movie experience for that person who isnt afraod of violence. The obvious thing about movie that is unique is the \\"comic booky\\" feel of the movie it is beautifuly redendered. For a fan of 300 or the watchman you will not.feep ripped off by this purchuse.
B005FVA3LK|4.0|Product is excellent.  Get one of these sets before they are no longer avail. if a U2 fan.  Some great versions of classic U2 songs.<br />Box set was a little dinged up upon arrival....not sure this was the result of shipping either.

B001RTSPVY|4.0|Love the show, but it doesn't play on my dvd player. It does play on my portable device. So, what's wonky about the programming that it doesn't play on a name-brand player (all my other dvds play just fine.)
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I am challenged with this nutty game.  Believe it or not, my 5 year old granddaughter taught me how to play it.  Before I watched her, I had NO idea how to play it, and still would like some real help here~ ha.
0394873742|4.0|My 2-year-old granddaughter loved it, but it's really too big to be practical for a lot of homes. Still, it was her favorite for a long time.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|Very entertaining and a spectacle to watch. A great way to forget where you are and what happened that day....an experience.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|It plays on my portable device. Is it pirated? The show, of course, is wonderful, so it's worth the Rube Goldberg setup to get it to play on our TV.

B005S9EKCW|1.0|Terrible movie. Who in the world sings an entire movie about a piece of bread.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY! Terrible premise and everything about this movie is pathetic.<br /><br />ONLY WOMAN WILL WATCH AND CRY OVER BREAD!

B00190OHD6|5.0|Saw the last few minutes of this on tv, and had to see it all.  So I ordered it and what a wonderul love story.  The scenery is beautiful and the acting first rate.  Keep you tissues handy - this husband truly loved his wife.

B008602KQI|1.0|Teenagers killing each other for the gratification of some futuristic society of color-haired wacko police state. Acting is quite good. No plot, mindless, kept me watching assuming it has to have a purpose...  I kept checking how much time is left. Something has to happen... There had to be a point to everything that happened.... Our hero and heroine needed to put an end to the hunger games, surely they would stick it to the establishment. No, that didn't happen. Surely love that was hinted at would be revealed, no that didn't happen. No story, no plot, no closure, no lesson, no morale, nothing. Just kids killing kids for no reason.  Do yourself a favor and don't watch. You will thank me.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|First of all I don't mind reading a movie if it is good. Besides the French accent is pleasant to listen to.  That being said, this is a great movie! You laugh, you cry, you get mad, you empathize, sympathize, and want to just be around these guys.  I loved the progression from employee/employer to closest friends, almost like family. I love the humor involved and how the attendant who came from a poor background just cannot relate to the &#34;niceties&#34; of the ultra rich. My only complaint is that I was left a bit confused when the attendant's nephew/cousin came for him. That was not really clear enough because I kept expecting him to return to work. Anyway, this is a beautiful expression of human behavior and how love and friendship go deeper than anything superficial or physical.  Love this movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Actually, imho, \\"great\\" is inadequate to describe how good this omnibus is. A friend gave it to me for my birthday. I figured it would be a decent read, because she is an ebook editor. But I was hooked by the end of the first page. It is an incredible, yet totally believable story of life in some future where the outside world is deadly and people live in great silos for their entire lives. I was fascinated by the details of HOW they live, which are well and logically presented through the story. No boring expositions here! The book is well written and the plot had me reading late into the night. The characters are so believable I grieved when they suffered. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B009CPE424|4.0|I don't even like Chihuahuas but this was really cute.  I enjoyed it and I'm an adult.  I'm sure kids would love it.  And I could somehow totally related to &#34;Poppy&#34; the dad.  Very good innocent movie.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Frank Darabont is the guy responsible for bringing THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE GREEN MILE to the screen. He's one of the best directors in the business and he has created another gem with the delightful film, THE MAJESTIC.<br /><br />The film takes place in the late 1950's. A cynical screenwriter, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) discovers that he is being investigated by Congress for &#34;un-American activities.&#34; Peter is blacklisted, gets drunk, goes for a drive, and ends up falling off a bridge into a river. He is awakened on a beach by a dog and discovers he has amnesia. Peter &#34;looks familiar&#34; to everyone he meets and is eventually mistaken for someone else, a guy named Luke.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is wonderful. He's a great actor with a Jimmy Stewart/Tom Hanks everyman persona. His portrayal of Peter/Luke has all the charm of Stewart's George Bailey.<br /><br />Darabont has said he has always wanted to make a Frank Capra-type film. He has succeeded with THE MAJESTIC. It contains the classic Capra formula: lovable everyman rises to defend all that is good and wholesome about America, becomes a hero, and wins the girl. Darabont tweeks the formula a little, but remains true to the Capra system.<br /><br />Several scenes are taken directly from Capra pictures. When Peter falls off the bridge and awakens in a new life, it reminded me of George Bailey in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. When Peter testifies before a Congressional hearing, images of Jimmy Stewart as Mr. Smith in MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON kept coming to mind.<br /><br />THE MAJESTIC is Capraesque in another significant way. Capra elevated the ordinary man in his films to illustrate the nobility in all and uphold all that is good in America. THE MAJESTIC does this, but it upholds one particular aspect of American life: it reveres the movies. It illuminates them and speaks of them as they were meant to be. People have always love movies, but movies have lost much of the luster that once made them grand. THE MAJESTIC seeks to reclaim the glory of times past by instilling the lesson of why movies are good.<br /><br />Several critics have panned THE MAJESTIC for being too sentimental. Critics said the same thing about Capra and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. In the end the good guys win.nd.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Suspense.  I wanted to find out the truth. Twists and turns.  Not the best writing but compelling to the last.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had heard of the trilogy and the sex. But it is jus so Much more!! I was pleasantly surprised and Han many sleepless nights, Could not put my Kindle down.
0143116738|5.0|Very inspiring book. If you haven't found your path yet,  this book will be a great eye opener! If you have found your talents and your path, this will be a great reassuring guidance. Great book for parents also! It will help you guide your kids through very important decision making moments in their life!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Enjoyed reading the book while reflecting it to my habits and challenges in life. Reading the science and logic behind habits was a new area for me and hence made this book more intriguing.
B005G02RIC|1.0|There are two reasons why you shouldn't waste your money on this dvd: first, the sound is not nearly as good as that of indoor productions; second, Cedolins portrayal of Tosca is mediocre both vocally and dramatically. There are so many good recordings of Tosca around. In my opinion, the best vocal and dramatic characterisation of Floria Tosca is to be found in the 2012 Covent Garden production with Terfel, Kaufmann, and the insuperable Angela Gheorghiu (available as blu-ray).
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I appreciate  that you are limited in the number of rounds you can play, nice for those of us with no self control.  A few more lives would be nice though.  I refuse to spend real money on the game, and I agree with others who do not want to sync with a fb page. I think very carefully when the app says that I need a fb  acct.  i use it on my kindle, no glitches.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I love this series.  It is a combination of war, soft porn and vengeance.  One word of caution, women will hate this.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|cool game love it still needs a little more characters but it is an awesome game no doubt.so. I would recommend this game to anybody who loves racing games
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Excellent product. The mic pre-amps are crystal clear and full. The audio playback is simply fantastic. I love it when you don't need to install drivers (though it is recommended). I just plugged it into my MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion (10.8) and was ready to go. The LED halos over the gain knobs is pure class. Absolutely love the scarlet red aluminum unibody chassis. If I had anything to complain about it would have to be that the \\"Line/Inst\\" & \\"Direct Monitoring\\" switches are a little on the fragile-feeling side but other than that I can't complain. This is an excellent device overall and perfect for the on-the-go recording musician/engineer.
B009NX2XA0|5.0|I watched it, told my husband, he watched it and with me. Excellent western. But I love westerns.<br />One of the rare westerns I hadn't seen. Can check it off my &#34;top 100 westerns&#34; list.<br /> I'm a westerner. I know and recognize where this was filmed and most other western films. Some western movies just capture the feeling of the west. The story was ok, but Wayne and Mitchum make up for it.<br />Check out IMB for trivia while watching. These two actors went off script a lot. Enjoy.
B0099114WO|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, who doesn't love Meryl Streep & Tommie Lee Jones!  Romantic and Funny, pulls you right into their lives.
B005PK57NU|4.0|Always look forward to watching. Just good story line, acting, characters, directing. Such a rarity to find that combination.  I even watch the reruns...that I rarely do on anything else.
B004LWZWC4|5.0|I love this movie. What a hilarious, unlikely trio of actors. My husband and I are birders and love it, but others get a kick out of it too. Clean, but brilliant humor. And a unique story, which is rare these days.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Includes not just a timer but offers seven choices of Tibetan singing bowls which can be set up before, during or after your session.  Personalizable and simple to use.  Reasonable price and is worth what is asked for it.  There is also capility to connect with the global meditation community to see who is meditating with you...I really liked that feature.  There are presets and interval bells.  It is personalizable and includes a meditation journal to track your progress.  It does exactly what it promises to.<br /><br />This is a wonderful compliment to your meditation, yoga or Reiki sessions.  Highly recommended.
B00AYM6JFO|3.0|This was an item bought for someone so I really do not know how they like it or if they have received it yet.
B001KWZ796|5.0|If you are a fan of medieval love stories or fairy tales I highly recommend this movie. Drew Barrymore's performance as the cinder girl and her rise up to princess is enchanting. Innocent and kind yet sharp-witted, she embodies the role of Cinderella. You'll fall in love every time you see this movie again-not one to miss!!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|For symmetry with the black gore of the sequels,  the sparkling and overwhelming world of he Hobbit was euthanized.  Replaced by Stepford Hobbit.<br /><br />Stupid characters like the brown wizard are invented rather than tackle the chilling spider woods scenes of the Book.  How amazing that would have been.  Instead of the brown wizzard nursing a possum back to life while spider shadows crawl over the windows.  And now that you've got the danged brown wizard, they used him to run back and forth in a sled drawn by rabbits, meanwhile keeping the next plot link improbably in view.<br /><br />Yeesh.  Grade C-minus.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|A brilliant analysis of the many puzzling aspects of the capitalistic failures in South America, Russia, China and other countries. Like many partially informed Americans, I too assumed that democracy and free market principles were meant to be together.  Klein compellingly explains why some basic controls over unfettered markets are essential to a healthy society and that there are some basic needs in any country that are best provided by the public sector: infrastructure, utilities, a medical safety net, military security, etc.  the healthiest economies are indeed free, but they are also a mix of private capitalism and social assistance.  The growing autonomy and economic recovery of the South American countries is a model for all countries to consider.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|At every level, wonderful.<br />This is a non-sentimentalized real story of a family caught in the Boxing Day Tsunami.,<br />How it tests them, how it strengthens them, and as we watch the story unfold, it skillfully conveys the impossible odds against which not only they--but all who were there--were up against.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|The book is riveting.  Anyone who wants to understand Alzheimer's from a human as well as moderate medical perspective will find this book invaluable.

B004X75RK4|4.0|This is an enjoyable comedy. Sandra Bullock shows her usual excellent comedic presentation. By no means a great movie that inspires philosophical debate...just entertaining and has a good feel ending, no matter how implausible it is that a &#34;witch who rides her broom&#34; can completely change over a weekend. But, no matter...it's a fun escape, and that's not nothing!

B000JCSPG0|5.0|This is a great film.  I enjoyed it immensely in the movie theater, and watching it again, I must say it is not as realistic as I remembered it being, but it was still really entertaining.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We sent it as a gift because we liked the original as shown on TV, Showtime.  The recipients thoroughly enjoyed being able to capture the season's presentation.  They did not have access to Showtime and enjoyed the presentation without weekly interruptions.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This is a well produced picture that I found very entertaining and mildly thought-provoking.<br /><br />HOWEVER, If you have seen any of the films in the &#34;Alien&#34; series, you should go into this knowing it is intended as a prequel to that series.  If you haven't seen any of them, the film stands well on its own.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Best Book I've read.  Never a dull moment. High action great characters and the near the end gave me chills at one point.  Really look foward to the next book.
0140177191|5.0|This vastly ambitious work has to be one of the best re-telling of the Arthurian saga I have ever read. Marion Zimmer Bradley brings the past vibrantly to life with such clarity and energy, as to draw you into a magical world filled with intense passion and rivalry. Completely compelling and simply stunning, I was blown away by how beautifully written this exceptional novel is for the author's fluidity and use of language is just delightful. For those seeking assured narrative, illuminating and insightful text then I highly urge you to seek out one of the greatest writers of her craft, and a splendidly masterful work of epic proportions.<br /><br />`In my time I have been called many things: sister, lover, priestess, wise-woman, queen'<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />This is the story of the magical land of Avalon wherein all those inhabitants worship the Goddess and live by spiritualistic rituals and archaic traditions of old. In Avalon lies the great Warlock Merlin and Morgaine, who watch over the land beyond the veil of Glastonbury and Camelot. The young man Arthur is crowned King, with the enchanting Guinevere as Queen by his side and the Knights of the Round Table to protect the kingdom; including Sir Gwain and Sir Lancelot. It is a turbulent time in which Saxon invasion is imminent and Avalon itself is threatened to become nothing more than a myth, lost within the murky mists forever. Excalibur, the famous sword aids Arthur in his journey to becoming King, but it is also a sign of the uniting of Camelot and the Druids - the past and the present connected within time.<br /><br />Within a crucible of change Morgaine is tricked into sleeping with her own brother due to the Priestess of Avalon (the lady of the lake) and her tutor Viviane, who wishes for Camelot and Avalon to unite. The two are connected when Arthur is crowned King and his sister Morgaine has his child, Mordred, who ultimately will decide the fate of both worlds. Meanwhile Sir Lancelot's affections for Arthur's chosen wife Guinevere threatens to cause a great rift, if it was not for her strength of character and Guinevere's eagerness to produce an heir for her husband. Sadly the King is without a Son and so as Vivienne's treachery is later on revealed, it is Mordred and the Saxon invasion which will destroy magic for good. It seems in the end that the ways of the Goddess are all-but forgotten and that new religious practices, like Christianity and Roman ways, drive the ancient worship of the mother forever into the mists...Avalon is still out there somewhere, hidden from view. The Goddess is not forgotten, as Morgaine discovers, when in the nunnery at Glastonbury she encounters those praying to Mary Madeline - the Goddess in another form.<br /><br />Characters such as Morgaine, Vivienne, Merlin and Arthur are so memorable and their story is captured perfectly in this unforgettable tale that is mystical and magical.<br /><br />\\"...Morgan le fay was not married, but put to school in a nunnery, where she became a great mistress of magic.\\"<br />- Malory, Morte d'Arthurs for Arthur's chosen wife Guinevere threatens to cause a great rift, if it was not for her strength of character and Guinevere's eagerness to produce an heir for her husband.

0756407915|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss' `the Kingkiller chronicles' began spectacularly in The name of the wind hence leaving me in anticipation as to its continuation. This substantial read at 994 pages is no `light read' and yet the compelling saga draws you in, so as to make it seem a smaller volume than it actually is as you race through the pages. I dream of tales to get lost in and other worlds that enchant and dazzle, similarly to the likes of JRR Tolkien and George RR Martin. This supremely singular story is darkly magnetic and so beautifully captured, as to send chills running down your spine with astonishment. Not in many years have I been so truly gripped and blown-away by such an extraordinarily rich fantasy saga, which embodies everything I love within a timeless read. Such as; great characters who are memorable and distinctive together with delicate ambience, and a wonderfully imaginative world by a true visionary writer.<br /><br />Highly original and unique, Patrick Rothfuss puts his own distinct flair and recognizable style into his writing thus standing-out noticeably within a highly competitive genre. Blending magic, love and adventure in one remarkably epic tale herein lies a sweeping journey which will literally take your breath away and make dreaming reality!<br /><br />Day 2: continues the story of one man, Kvothe and the myth that remained. The Dragon-slayer and skilled swordsman is a feared Wizard with such immense power, and this is his personal journey and story. He vanished suddenly as if into thin air, with no trace of his whereabouts nor any knowing his story is still told...as darkness rises from the corners of the world. Answers about the Chandrian are disclosed as he grapples with even more deadly dangers than before. Full of surprises and astonishing delights this truly is a special tale, exquisitely written with such deftness and fluidity. Rothfuss' characters are `real' and are not without flaws or emotions, hence one is really able to connect and relate to them.<br /><br />I am very excited about this fantasy work and so can't wait to read the final installment within this vast trilogy.te to them.<br /><br />I am very excited about this fantasy work and so can't wait to read the final installment within this vast trilogy.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book. Almost do not want to see the movie. Highly recommend!!!!  Going to have my husband read it next.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Liked it. Inspired me to get a trail running backpack and attempt something profound and arduous and wild. Impressive introspection, syntax, and literary art
B000PY6BBI|4.0|Matthew Broderick does a good job in his role.  The best part about the movie is the character development and heroism of Broderick's character.  Well worth watching!
B003XMXZCW|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The blu-ray versions are nice. the quality is also great. thanks for the order.
B0045XICB2|5.0|This part of the series kept the view drawn in and stayed close to the book. I will watch again.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The characters in this book were skillfully described.  This book was a good read, humorous in places, poignantly sad  in others.  It is a pleasant book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to start the next book, and then the last. It kept me mesmorized!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I had trouble getting past the very beginning.  The opening scene was so bucolic that it made me sleepy!  But then the action picked up, and I just couldn't stop reading it.  And like any good book, just when I thought I had it figured out, I didn't!  The characters of Jimmy, Dolly, and Vivien come alive along with the sights and sounds of WWII in England.  I just read it a second time to see if I should have seen the ending coming, and I liked it even more the second time.  Don't rush with this book, just curl up in a very comofortable spot (AFTER you get by the first few pages) and enjoy!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Hooked!  Can't wait for season 4. Seasons 1 and 2 were introduced by a friend and had to order season 3 since it had already completed on PBS.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I choose this book to read on vacation. My curiosity of mental illness is what helped me read almost the entire book during the flight. This was a good read!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very exciting and keeps you turning pages to see what happens next. I would recommend reading this book if you want suspense, excitement and lots of action
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Great movie! Portrays much art development. Frida goes through hell and back but makes her dream of becoming an artist true.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Setup and install on windows 8 64-bit was cumbersome.  When I first inserted the CD (could not download drivers from the website) it actually hung the windows explorer process.  So bad that I had to turn off the computer as it would not restart.  After the reboot I was able to install the drivers however I kept getting a pop up to unplug and plug the wireless dongle, until I turned on the headset.  After that I found that my Logitech G13 game pad had lost the settings I had made for World of Warcraft.<br />Getting past the install issues, the mic is very sensitive to key clicks and easily picks them up at about the same volume as you speak, so its hard to use sensitivity in applications like ventrillo as it will pick up all the key clicks and make everyone else hear them.<br />The quality of the voice recording was not as good as it sounded in the review videos.  It sounds more robotic and tinny.<br />Finally when playing World of Warcraft there is a very noticeable background white noise.  It seems to go away when the game exists, however it was not there on my last headset (Creative Labs World of Warcraft wireless headset).<br />Overall very disappointing.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great light. very bright. Love it. I like knowing I have it with me since I carry my kindle everywhere I go.[[ASIN:B0066WJLU6 Flashlight HD LED]]
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a nice change from just reading on your Kindle, and a great late night activity just before lights out.<br /><br />I play almost every night !!!
B00005OWIU|5.0|Wonderful music to a wonderful movie and it was composed by one of my favorite movie composors John Williams!  Great for anyone that likes instumental music or is a fan of Harry Potter and a fan of music by John Williams.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have several friends who rave about this show, so I decided to take a look.  I was hooked and watched an entire season in a week.  My husband is not a fan and could careless about the show.  He says it is one of those show women love and wish their husbands would watch with them.  The character development is excellent, but please don't kill off any more main characters!!  The British accents are heavy, so if English is not your first language - it will be hard for you to understand.
B004H4XI5O|3.0|It starts quite well but then, as others have commented before, becomes a recapitulation of interesting facts just loosely related to memory. It's not bad but there is no general plot or a real story line that will make you keep reading.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Truly an American Hero.  An amazing story of Duty, Honor and Country.  Protecting the lives of so many American soldiers.  Truly inspirational.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. It was so sweet, charming and of course sad.  The author had excellent character and plot development.  The one word I keep thinking of when I think about this book is \\"charming.\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|First of all who ever doesn't like this game is an idiot. He/she has something wrong with them. I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br />this game!!!!!! do u? I made New York. it was addicting but fun.<br />my brother is a talented minecraft drawer. so rate this game with five stars!!!!!!!!!!!  thanks:  Frankie:-)
1612680011|5.0|Robert really nailed it! This book has changed my life fundamentally... Couldnt put it down. Everything makes so much sense now
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this app is awesome! my friend showed it to me and I said I had it but he made me get it again and it was so much fun!
B002H5HJ9G|4.0|The movie is pretty good, especially if you are a fan of The Silence of the Lambs. The only downside to the movie is, unfortunately, Edward Norton. He is an incredible actor but not in this role. His portrayal of Will Graham is just kind of boring. I much prefer the Will Graham in the new Hannibal TV show. All of the parts with Anthony Hopkins and Ralph Fiennes are great, though. Overall good movie that you should at least watch if you are a fan of The Silence of the Lambs or Thrillers/Mysteries in general.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put the book down. I felt so bad for the mother from the beginning and did not expect the dreadful ending. I have told all my friends about this book and highly recommend it.
0385742886|5.0|I would recommend reading this book after the other three. You will understand the beginning and ending if you do. I liked this book the most out of the series. Even though there are different characters in this book that the other three it's not hard to get into the story.
076790592X|5.0|This is definitely the beer inspirational book I have ever read! Morris truly lectured the real meaning of life. We can always find the peace from this book.
0385737947|3.0|I feel this book starts off really slow due to the lack of information you get when he first arrives in the maze. Nobody will even talk to him. Even if the author would have given false information or used the other characters to tell ghost stories of the place, I would have enjoyed it more. I stuck with it though, and was intrigued by the end of the book. I kept with it and read the other 3 books, and would have to say that this is a really good series overall, just a bit slow in this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|do you have a I phone if you do get subway surfers on your I phone you can get it on any phone really gi e it a five star rate it is awsome
0385738773|5.0|While reading these books, you really see James writing style really improve over the series. I would have to say that this book and the prequel, The Kill Order, are by far the best books in this series.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|The card was everything I expected it to be. I received it much faster than I anticipated, but that was great as I needed it as soon as I could get it. Price was the best I could find anywhere.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|So much fun that I for get to sleep I just keep playing it. Its a fun why to wast time
0061124958|5.0|E.B. White's best, and a heart-wrenching account of a child's coming to grips with life and death, plus an entertaining talking animal story.  My five yr old, who doesn't like spiders, wept at Charlotte's death.
B008D30K7E|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The character Allan was so likeable. We learned about his past and present adventures. There were so many twists and turns. You never knew how Allan was going to get out of the most peculiar situations, but somehow he always did with plenty of laughs along the way. So many different characters, somehow all interconnected and good or bad you managed to like them all in the end. This was a light-hearted book that kept may attention and had me smiling to the last page. A very enjoyable read.<br /><br />O.Murray
B00B769XB8|5.0|Cheap movie and know it before you watch it but it was GREAT, I loved it soooo much! Easily can go down as a classic in my playlist!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|i could never get this to work on my kindle fire. it was also very hard to download, so useless
0345803485|5.0|This is the best book IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!! I killed my mother and let her bleed onto the pages. Then I fed them to my cat, Marvelous Mr. Mistophilees. Then I KILLED HIM TOO!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS GREAT THE PROSE IS AWESOME AND SO IS THE CHARACTERIZATION AND IMAGERY IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THE AUTHOR DESERVES A PULITZER!!!!
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Interesting format giving me the ability to view what I want and the many areas covered is extensive.<br /> making it an enjoyable experlience.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|A very funny movie I'm sure your kids and family will enjoy, I can't do nothing more but to recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|This program really doesn't have much to offer, even my 6 year old friend didn't care for it.  How can I delete it from my Kindle?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very fun game. Sometimes hard to get the 3 stars, but makes it more fun, frustrating and challenging. I recommend it.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|I thought this was a  full-blown version. It is not. I don't mind it, but I wish they had explained this before I downloaded it.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|This happens to be one of my favorite movies! I watch it when I can. Can't wait to share it with my boys!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I thought I was somewhat in shape because I frequented my treadmill regiment followed by using my perfect sit-ups and push-ups.  Please let me stress to you, I really found out that I was not as in shape as I thought.  Like many reviewers stated, &#34;This workout kick, NO, Whipped My Ass! Yes the exercises are basic yet they are very affective.  Will I give up NO!  (Jillian, you Won the first round) thank you for a well plan workout!  After this I realized that just lifting weights and cardio is not where it is as I now have very great respect for this style of workout. This was my first day and I am confident that by my 10 th day I will be on point.  Wow!  I do recommend this DVD.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is one of our favorites. We now have completed the phase one of the Avengers! Now excited to get more movies!
B001AT4Y84|5.0|pure fantasy fun. grab the popcorn and get ready for a fast ride from start to finish. T3 is great.
B008I74JLS|3.0|I personally think the US version is better written & produced from the few episodes I have seen in commparison. Athough the UK version is the original in this series, I find the script//dialogue too peppered with 4 letter expletives as well as English idioms to be enjoyable.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I just love these tile games! Been having such a great time, and so far the app has been working very well
B00280LYIC|5.0|Very thrilling. Lots of excitement. One of the best books I have read. Their was even some slight humor. Loved this book!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This tutorial is too basic to really put out a finished product, and it should not be your only guide if you're jumping in to the self-publishing world for the first time.  Self-publishing takes time, so you'll need to purchase a few books (or read a lot of blogs) to really get started.  This book is not up to the task because it fails to address many technical issues that the conversion from Word will entail.  For instance, Word has many quirks that do not translate well to the digital Mobi version on the Kindle format (HTML code basically with a few modifications).  When you convert from Word, you'll have the chapters of your book start off indented as Word does that, but many readers expect the drop words or small blocks, which I have no idea how you would do on Word. Also, Word has a number of quirks that may cause your book to look unprofessional when you get the finished form.<br /><br />Guides that I suggest that address the above-mentioned problems as well as others include: [[ASIN:B009G2JMRK The eBook Design and Development Guide]] and  [[ASIN:B005DC68NI Let's Get Digital: How To Self-Publish, And Why You Should (Let's Get Publishing)]] by David Gaughran (recommended to me by best-selling author Deborah Geary).  These books will really give you the details and examples you need to flesh out your e-book into a more polished product.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.<br /><br />Rian Davis, author of [[ASIN:B00C3KD5OI Mi-hyun]] and [[ASIN:B00BLPYPJU Credit Check]]
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think it is worth getting its fun its relaxing and helps relive stress my 2 year old son loves to play it two
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|It's cool to watch your shark grow but all it does it get a little bigger and a little faster.  The world you swim in is fairly small so it can get boring pretty fast.  It's a good time killer.  No need to be connected to wifi, the game is stand alone.  Probably not something for very young children to play as there is blood and you can eat people.  If you wouldn't let your kid see Jaws you may want to steer clear.  Not a complaint, just an observation.
1400156653|5.0|For a week while driving to and from work, I listened to the unabridged audio book version in the car CD system. It was mesmerising. Listening to the narrator John Lee has a different effect from passively reading the printed pages. Worth every minute. When listening to the last CD, I sat in the car in the carpark for more than 15 minutes to listen to the dramatic account of the murder.<br /><br />I disagree with one reviewer who said the narrator doesn't sound Indian. In Singapore we have a large Indian community and I have many India friends since childhood, so I know how Indian speech sounds like. Like all skilled narrators, John Lee is able to convey the tone of voice of the different characters in a highly realistic manner. Throughout the audio, I felt I was eavesdropping on a conversation of an exceptional shrewd and observant Indian telling his story.<br /><br />Coincidentally, a fortnight before, I was listening to the audio book version of Saul Bellow's Herzog. The White Tiger follows a similar introspective monologue format. In literary quality, The White Tiger is as good as Herzog!<br /><br />If you've read the print, go get the audio book -- you will feel that you're in India, with the narrator, and not stuck inside your car in a traffic jam on the road. You might even hope the jam lasts longer so you could listen more!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got burned out after about a week.  It was nice to kill some time with for a while.  Don't expect to make the top players lists without a hack/mod.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|What more to say than wow? Wow! Nick is nothing less than amazing, and this CD is nothing less than perfect. Enjoy!
B004MC0FO8|3.0|Unfortunatly if you're out of wi-fi range this app won't do you much good. (Kindle Fire HD)  It seems okay at picking up mainstream music but when my wife played one of her ballet songs (classical music) it couldn't identify it.  I have noticed a few commercials running will have the shazam symbol appear on the screen which will let you interact with a virtual version of the item (test driving a lawnmower for instance) but it takes longer than the 30 sec commercial for me to get the kindle out of sleep mode and get the app started.  Really this is just nitpicking though, if there is a song on the radio you like this app will more often then not give you the right information and, hey, it's free.
B005LAIIKI|1.0|The reason Quentin Tarantino has had the time to watch so many bad movies is because he doesn't like the written word. Most people of Tarantino's intelligence discover that reading is a higher bandwidth way of finding out about the world than watching straight-to-video dreck. But the auteur's learning disability has left him defensively proud that he's ill-informed about everything other than movies.<br /><br />Tarantino is always infuriating. If he could get away from his adolescent revenge violent fantasies he clearly has a knowledge of film history and has the money to hire fine movie technicians. But this film is a complete waste of time and money. Films I enjoyed tend to have violent scenes in them but they do not glorify violence. I felt dirty watching this film and am embarrassed I stayed until the end. There is a weak story here with cruelty and violence beyond the pale. For those who can separate fiction from reality, yet have a peculiar bent towards violence, this movie may be manageable. For those without good filters, this is fodder for another Newtown. Sorry I gave Tarantino my money - that I wasted any of it is incidental, that I encouraged him to make more trash is deplorable. I think there is a place for violence, where it adds to the story, in this case the movie was solely about violence. Is there a plot? Yes, but it is secondary; this is about blood and guts - and I don't mean bravery. There is no redeeming aspect to the movie, don' waste your time.<br /><br />If anyone else had done this movie, it would be savaged for its low quality. I don't know what this movie was supposed to be. The apparent possibilities are: 1. spaghetti western, 2. black exploitation film, 3. overblown gore fest, 4. knockoff of heaven only knows how many other movies. In the end it was some of all. But the acting, except for the good Dr. Schultz, is miserable. Everyone is a caricature.<br /><br />The settings are all wrong....I mean snow-capped peaks in the South? The firearms are not period correct. You can even see the Italian proof marks on them. No effort was made to put together anything other than a 3 hour endurance test for your bladder. Oscars? What, are you on crack? The best way to watch this film is as part of a Mystery Science Theater 3000. In that way you can at least enjoy the humor.<br /><br />If you have to watch it wait until it becomes available Netflix or it ends up in the $5 bins at Walmart.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I can't believe this game had so few people playing it.  There are several different vehicles to play with and unlock and all of them have varying levels of attributes but not of the break/ruin the game.  I stayed with the little dunebuggy that is the default car because it fits my playstyle but it's easy to see how the other cars in the game could be better suited to someone else.  Lots of upgrades to buy with coins earned in the game, all the vehicles can be customized with different paint and graphics and there are different drivers to unlock and pick from.  The drivers are just an aesthetic but it's a lot of fun to see a skeleton drive a corvette.  There is a lot of game here for being a free download.  I liked it so much that I even sprang for the $1 double coins upgrade. (it's permanent)  Bonus: This one is kid friendly but they may have trouble prying it out of mom and dad's hands.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|The Schrade SCHF9 is very well built. The handle is grippy and fits my fairly large hand well. The balance is great. The sheath is terrific too, I prefer leather but this one is well designed, love the detachable pouch. This thing is thick and is heavy, great for chopping. The design is good, there is a finger rest on the base of the blade and ridges on the back for better control if skinning, etc. I would prefer a saw-back blade and partial serration, I believe one would have to pay upward of $150 to get a better knife.
1402793375|5.0|This book should be required reading in all American schools.  This important chapter in our history puts the growth of our concepts of &#34;liberty and justice for all&#34; into question.  It puts civil rights of native people in the context of the contemporary Civil War and world events, and invites everyone to explore the true meaning of forgiveness.  The atrocities committed against native peoples are an eye-opener, and are comparable to the horrors of Hitler and Stalin.  My concept of American  politics and democracy have been permanently affected.  These stories of shame and courage are truly enlightening.  The illustrated edition is definitely helpful and brings the book to life, showing the locations of the tribes and giving us a frank portrait of both the heinous villains and the noble victims.
B00BYKIKJS|2.0|Premise: married male teacher comes home to find his wife in teh shower having sex with another teacher. (They are all teachers by the way.) Married guy \\"Snaps\\" and beats the adulterer so badly he almost dies and has to be hopsitalized. Married guy cops a plea withe courts, not for anger management therapy, but to be put in a mental hospital. Married guy gets out after 8 months and wants to get his wife back. Instead he meets a widow whose husband dies in a car accident on the way back to her with some lingerie to get her to have sex with him as she has been \\"depressed\\" and \\"distant\\". She therefore \\"snaps\\" at his beloved husband's death and her guilt over being sex and not giving him sex and goes and has sex with everyone and anyone. She lives close to the ex mental patient married guy. They meet and fall in love.<br /><br />Message: Crazy is normal is what this movie was trying sell. The characters even say so. They tell their families as the families didn't \\"snap\\" and do crazy stuff and get locked up for it or get fired for it or lose everything they have because of it that they are the real psychotic one and psychotic characters are really the sane, normal ones who are \\"living\\". For example, the married guy's dad we learn beat up people at a football game and therefore is barred from the stadium for life. So naturally because he now lives with his wife in their house and comfortably and likes family an d football he is not being \\"real\\" as he has not been discovered as psychotic like his son was. The sexaholic's brother-in-law lives in misery as he is henpecked by the sexaholic's sister. So of course since they don't talk and just grumble behind each other's backs they are the real psychotic ones, not the sexaholic or the angry out of control guy. They even take this theme one step further. The angry crazy guy really isn't crazy. It is just learned behavior from the father and because the older brother is favored and because the crazy guy has low self-esteem. Movie moral: if you have a feeling run with it to the extreme otherwise you are repressing yourself and cause yourself harm. Don't bother with maturity and learning to deal with your emotions. Just let'er fly.<br /><br />Also as with all Bradley Cooper movies I have seen you have the liberal moralizing. You have Asian Indians being made fun of be those \\"evil white people\\" (those \\"other\\" white people) at the ball game. Some Philadelphia rednecks sees the bus of Asian Indians tailgating and cooking curry and says somethingn about how stinky it is. So naturally it is OK to go into a rage and beat up the guy because \\"we all know all non-white Americans are just victims waiting to happen and by the victimizer evil white man\\".<br /><br />The two characters are just self-centered and foul mouthed. I wouldn't even want to know them let alone cheer for them to get together in the end . . . but we are supposed to. We are supposed to be their advocates much in the same way we were told to support the weird \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" family. Because again \\"normal is crazy. Crazy is normal.\\" \\"We are never to blame for our behavior . . . it is always someone else's or something's fault . . . infidelity. . . a death . . . etc.\\"<br /><br />The movie was very sloppy even in delivering its message. Which is it? The guy is not crazy and the pills make him numb. Or in reality he is really crazy after beating up his mother and get somewhat normal after being forced to take the pills? We get it both ways . . . kinda just thrown at us.  The dance . . . . Uh . . . nothing really to say there but we are supposed to be impressed by their \\"hard work\\" preparing for a dance competition. But in reality it looks sloppy and stupid, even for the role it plays in the movie. He isn't going to keep his promise to go rehearse but instead go to the game. No wait he is. No wait he didn't. But she is OK with it. What??? Again just sloppy delivery.<br /><br />But outside of liberal hotbeds most of us know that these characters are just losers. No tears are shed except for the $14.99 you have to pay to see this now before the paying the newly increased price of a VOD rental on Amazon of $3.99/4.99. (I guess we all have to pay for Amazon's pro-gay marriage campaigns).
