1400032717|5.0|First of all, I'd like to address an earlier reviewer and say that there is not a lot of cursing in the book besides what would happen under any normal circumstances. For instance, when Christopher's father gets mad and says \\"for f***'s sake\\" or something along those lines. People cuss when they get mad, it happens. What was Mr. Haddon supposed to do, change it to sound pretty? \\"O MUFFIN CUPS!\\" now does that sound realistic? Don't think so.<br /><br />On to more important matters - this book was amazing. It really got you inside of Christopher's (the 15 year old boy with autism) head. You could really see how he reasoned things out and it led me to an understanding of autism that I never had before. It was an intriguing book - I could hardly put it down!<br /><br />This book is very different than anything else I have ever read - mostly because you're seeing the world through the mind of an autistic teenager.<br /><br />This book is highly original - and a must read!

0553274503|4.0|The success of Flowers for Algernon is really due to three things: the beginning of the story, the middle and the end. To start with the beginning: \\"progris riport 1: martch 5, 1965. Dr. Strauss says I shud rite down what I think and evrey thing that happins to me from now on.\\" There are not a lot of sf stories written in diary format, but immediately one wants to find out what happins, er, happens. And the first paragraph established our narrator, 37 years old, with considerable learning difficulties, and keen to \\"be smart\\". The details of the scientific procedure are not at all clear but don't need to be; the experiment, the bakery, and the adult literacy classes, are all simply and clearly laid out.  <br /> <br />The middle of the story includes two crucial scenes. The first of these is the moment when Charlie realizes that his colleagues from the bakery have been mocking him rather than being friendly; a fact that we the readers have known for some time. It's the crucial (and cruel) demonstration that Charlie's new intelligence puts him completely out of phase with his previous life. The second is the point when Charlie realizes that his new intelligence puts him far ahead of the scientists who have created it as well. In both short story and novel this is crystallized in the moment when he is astonished to learn that Professor Nemur doesn't understand Hindi. It's well done, because we the readers are unaware until then that Charlie has learnt the language in a matter of weeks, but it's perfectly credible that he has forgotten to mention this in his diary. The novel version of the story embeds this incident in the middle of the conference in Chicago episode.  <br /> <br />But it's the end of the story that really sticks in your mind. Charlie's realization that his new intelligence is only temporary, Algernon's death, and Charlie's subsequent regression back to the point where we first met him, all add up to perhaps the most poignant climax of any story, ending with one of the most memorable final sentences, \\"Please if you get a chance put some flowrs on Algernons grave in the bak yard.\\"  Mr. Keyes does a skillful job of showing us Charlie's meteoric rise from retardation to universal genius, and his tragic return to his original state. What we see along the way is that intelligence without compassion is fruitless. We also get what feels like a very realistic portrayal of the psychological growth of someone who gets a kind of accelerated childhood, in which a grown man discovers through psychotherapy and his own dawning intelligence that he is filled with repressed impulses and half-understood memories of major import to his own mental well-being.  <br /> <br />Charlie must struggle with feelings of love for his former teacher, with his sense of abandonment at the hands of his mother, and with his anger towards a sister who committed seemingly senseless acts of cruelty against Charlie in their childhood.  <br /> <br />At the end, the reader will have to decide if Charlie is better off than he was at the beginning of the book, and if being a genius was ultimately worth something of permanent value to him.  This book is a classic tear-jerker, as well as a quick and simple book for reluctant readers, which makes it suitable for just about anyone who can enjoy a good novel.  If you have the chance, read this book!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00081U7HC|5.0|Pretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition) has to be considered one of the most classical,romantic comedies made throughout the years. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are excellent actors together and without them I don't believe the movie would have been the same. This classic \\"fairy tale\\" movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest. This is not your typical romantic movie and I believe that is why so many people love this movie. Pretty Woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there. <br /> <br />      The 15th Anniversary Special Edition also brought some never-before-seen scenes, deleted scenes, and commentary. The deleted scenes are also a must watch, they are just simply hilarious, and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies, but who also likes added comedy as well. Pretty Woman is definitely one of the greatest films ever made. <br />

B000002KOY|5.0|This has got to be one of the most underrated albums of all time. it is an excellent debut from what could of been one of biggest bands of the 70's. I think they could of been as big as the eagles. they had danny whitten, (a gifted songwriter), nils lofgren(a excellent guitarist and good songwriter), jack nitzsche (who could write and was a good producer), billy talbot and ralph molina( a good rock rhythm section). as well as guests like ry cooder. The album was recorded in late 1970 and released in early 1971. by then danny whitten was deep into heroin, and it all fell apart as the band could not tour without whitten.  the album is full of excellent songs, especially whittens I don't want to talk about it and downtown. (a live version later appeared on neil youngs tonights the night.  but it was recorded at a april 1970 concert of neil young & crazy horses at the fillmore east, and features danny whitten on lead vocals). nils lofgrens beggars day is also very good, as well as nitzsches gone dead train. As good a debut as you'll find. should be in everyones collection
6301640659|4.0|This film is an amazing combination of over-the-top twists/turns, '70's-gloom, and 80's excessiveness.  It's about a heterosexual cop who, under the authority of the homophobic N.Y.P.D., goes undercover in the \\"underground\\" world of homosexuals and finds a handful of more than he perhaps thought he would.  It quite possibly doesn't portray gays accurately, but I didn't notice when I saw the film 'cause I don't really know any gay people...and I'm not gay.  I don't think it was trying to portray them accurately and I don't think it was trying to market itself to the \\"gay crowd\\" like Will&Grace does.  I think it was simply an idea that was well executed (considering how fantastical the plot is, really, it makes sense that gay people wouldn't be realistically portrayed, just like Moms aren't realistically portrayed on television, 'CAUSE IT'S FANTASY!!!. anyway).  I liked it, but it's really kinda naggin' me that people think it's \\"homophobic\\".  It's actually quite the opposite as the main character seems the only member of the NYPD that ISN'T homophobic...it's also urkin me that this film isn't on DVD.  I went to this site to specifically look FOR THIS FILM; and couldn't find it except for a raggedy old VHS copy...thanx Hollywood!
B00008OLYN|5.0|This disc has everything a discerning music listener of this genre could ask for: solid production, remarkable musicianship, and depth. It's not heavy like their other albums but that's what makes this even better, that Opeth isn't just another typical death metal act. All the songs work seamlessly and beautifully together. It's simply good music.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Loving the look of the Rolex Daytona, I spotted this watch on Amazon and just had to have one (at the price). <br />Arrived in a well padded display box, with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic - so no scratches. <br />Taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes. <br />The watch looks great - better than the images on the Web - and it works as described. <br />Other posters that have had issues should read the manual! It does all of the chrono functions, and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc. - Fantastic!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|My son is a big fan of the Gene Wilder \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" but I wasn't.  When the critics disliked this movie, I thought I could escape seeing it.  But, my son really wanted to see it so I took him.  To my surprise, I loved this one.  I saw it another time at the theater with my son and this time my husband, too.  We all enjoyed it.  The humor is great but what I liked best was the sweetness of the main character and the fact that Charlie had both parents, loved them, and wasn't whiny in his poverty.  It is hard to be poor but you can still be happy.  Family values in 2005?  You bet!  We signed up for this one before it was released.
0156027321|5.0|I do a lot of reading and try to throw something with literary merit into the mix every third book or so. It makes me feel better about the mass market junk food I usually consume and I generally retain something of value from the experience. The downside is that the reading is often dry and a little more work than I'd prefer on my train commute to and from work. I picked up this novel because it won several literary awards and because I couldn't find anything better at Target. What I got was one of the best books I have ever read. <br /> <br />The Life of Pi is one of those rare books that is as enjoyable to read as it is enriching. The style is simple but captivating and after a few chapters you will be pulled into Pi's world. The story follows the life of a teenaged boy from India and is written in three parts. The first part deals with his life in India and his family and mentors. The boy is fascinated by religion and practices not only his native Hindu but Christianity and Islam as well. He is also fascinated by animals and has plenty of opportunity to study them since his father owns and operates a zoo. Political turmoil in India causes his father to move his family and his zoo to Canada but the ship they are traveling on sinks halfway across the Pacific Ocean. This starts the second part of the book, which is Pi's riveting tale of survival aboard a lifeboat with a 450-pound Bengal tiger. The last part of the book wraps up the story and poses an important question about the whole story and about the nature of religion. The novel can be read on the surface and enjoyed as a fine survival tale or it can be delved into to examine the religious metaphors that reside within. Either way, there should be more than enough here to satisfy even the most discriminating palate. <br /> <br />I usually don't talk about the ending of a story in a review but the ending of this novel was so moving I couldn't resist. If you haven't read the book then I urge you to stop here andgo buy it. You will be glad you did. For those of you who have read the book and, like me, can't get the ending out of your heads then maybe this will help. My own take on the ending is that every religion, no matter how many adherents it has, is really a religion of one person. Everyone ultimately has to make their own leap of faith to find God. The existence of God can't be proven through scientific means, just like Pi's tale can't be factually proven. You either believe him when he tells you that he made the trip with the tiger or you don't believe him. Personally, I believe him because I don't think he would have had the will to live through the ordeal he lived through without the motivation of keeping the tiger appeased. I'll take the tiger any day, it feels better and makes more sense to me. <br /> <br />
B0007PALZ2|4.0|12 Monkeys is a convoluted tale of time travel, insanity, apocalypse, and who-done-it, with some romance thrown in.  What I enjoyed most about it was the twisting and ambiguous path it followed, which was fresh and well thought out, to a point.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays Cole, a prisoner in a post-apocalyptic future recruited to do some dangerous time-travel work in the past for a group of very odd scientists.  The goal of the work only becomes apparent later, and by then there is confusion about whether Cole is really on the mission he thinks he is or is just deluded.  Brad Pitt has a major supporting role hamming it up as another who may or may not be insane.<br /><br />Ultimately, while I don't think the film does full justice to its premises and possibilities, it does well enough to be entertaining and thought provoking.  Director Terry Gilliam's surrealism adds much.  The acting is very good on the whole, itself rather surreal in some of the supporting roles.  There is some violence showing how disturbed Willis's character is, not bad for an R-rated movie.  It's definitely worth seeing to judge for yourself what it's really about.<br /><br />I want to comment on the things you think about after the film is over, to see how well it holds up.  I'll have to go into details you may not want to know about if you haven't seen the film yet, thus the spoiler alert.  If you'd like to know what my general conclusions are, without any spoilers, just skip to the last couple paragraphs headed \\"In Sum.\\"<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />Madness<br /><br />There are many points designed to suggest that parts of the film are delusions, but they're balanced by points seeming to show the opposite.  There is the over-the-top strangeness of the future (the video ball, serenading scientists, etc.), the obvious parallels between the psych ward and the future prison (similar panels of doctors/scientists, the two guards, etc), the voice that calls Cole \\"Bob\\" (moving around as if in his head, though it seems to belong to the wino too), the music in the ruined department store (apparently a premonition (or something) of the time Cole is there in 1996), the lion and bear (again paralleled in 1996, unlikely denizens of a wintry abandoned Philadelphia).<br /><br />But then Cole's disappearances, the French that Cole himself doesn't understand in WWI (yes, it's real French), the photo of Cole from WWI (though nearly impossibly convenient), the WWI bullet, Cole's knowledge of the boy in the well prank, all seem to settle things conclusively against delusion.  That is, unless we're to imagine that not only the future but the whole film is delusions, of Cole (or Bob) and/or Railly, in line with her own fears and the comment by the virus culprit (Morse) that Railly might be succumbing to her Cassandra syndrome.  Confusing?  That's what Gilliam was aiming for.<br /><br />In a way, the view that the whole film is largely delusion seems the most coherent overall interpretation, in that it can explain away all failures of logic.  But it has trouble explaining how good the logic is.  The film, strange and muddled as it is, really does seem far too lucid and coherent to be primarily be a string of delusions.<br /><br />The End, Time Travel<br /><br />The ending has stirred much debate.  The woman sitting next to the culprit on the plane is one of the scientists from the future.  She is presumably there to do exactly what Cole said the scientists planned to do, gather a sample of the virus from before it mutated.  According to Cole, the scientists didn't send him to change the past, which he says is impossible.  He was sent to gather information, which he did.  We must assume that the sample is gathered and that this enables humanity in the future to return to the surface of the planet.  It doesn't help the 5 billion killed.<br /><br />That appears to be the basic sense of the ending, but it has its own loose ends.  Why was Cole given the gun, if not to try to change the past?  (Jose's line that it's too bad they didn't get the information sooner makes no sense to me in the context of time travel.)  The scientist introduces herself on the plane saying, \\"I'm in insurance,\\" which is a great line if she's a backup for Cole, in case he fails to stop the spread of the virus.  But that too implies he could have changed the past.  Even getting a sample of the virus seems to change the past.  Trying to figure out the point of all of this is further complicated by the the fact that we are shown the virus being released by the culprit when it was being inspected at the airport.  By the time Cole tried to shoot him it was already too late.  This adds to the pathos, and the confusion.<br /><br />Some views of time travel allow the past (and future) to change.  It could work this way.  Young Cole goes to the airport, there is no shooting, he survives the virus, and is eventually sent back, where he is shot, witnessed by young Cole, who survives the virus and is eventually sent back, where he remembers the shooting and gets shot (the scene we see near the end of the film).  This would allow one more twist in the film, one suspected by some optimistic viewers.  Railly, recognizing the boy Cole, would tell the boy to remember that the culprit wasn't the 12 monkeys gang but Dr. Goine's assistant.  Then Cole could conceivably grow up and loop back one more time, this time preventing the virus from ever being released, and getting the girl.  There is no hint of this, however.  Had the filmmakers wanted to hint at the possibility, they easily could have (by having Railly whisper something in the boy Cole's ear, for example).<br /><br />In Sum<br /><br />All in all, the film is stimulating and fun but ultimately more frustrating than it might have been.  I like a film that provokes thought, but I tend to prefer one that rewards it with additional insights and clarity.  That only goes so far here, and then things seem impossible, muddled or otherwise unsatisfying.  There is a certain postmodern sensibility that prefers just this kind of lack of clarity and incomplete logic.  I don't know if that was intended here or just came about accidentally (I suspect some of each), but if that sensibility is your thing, you should love this film.<br /><br />The DVD anamorphic video and 5.1 audio quality are fine.  There is commentary track with director Gilliam and producer Charles Roven, and a full-length making-of documentary.  Both are interesting and worth the time, but don't expect answers to the puzzles the film leaves, other than a hint or two expressed as personal opinion.ooner makes no sense to me in the context of time travel.)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The worst part of this series, is that it's no more.  I will never understand why this show didn't last.  By far, one of the best sci-fi shows, or any show for that matter, ever made.  The characters are complex, deep, and entertaining.  The humor is original and intelligent.  The plots and adventures refreshing.  I can't rave about it enough.  Joss, I need more, please make more Firefly!!!

B000BRBA8S|5.0|2046 is one of my favorite films of all time. I don't think I can add more to the praises heaped on Kar Wai's masterpiece (TIME magazine deems it the film gem of 2004). All I know is that when I first saw it in the cinema, I felt pressed to my seat and thought that I didn't deserve to see so much beauty. It is that overwhelming. If you're a cineast, do yourself a huge favor and see this film. If you can wait, I suggest that you see it in a cineplex first before getting the dvd. This ravishing film is not made for the small screen.
6305313687|5.0|This movie is so powerful and great. After I saw it for the first time I immediately decided it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world and is very underrated but I sort of like it that way. He's one of my personal favourites. Edward Furlong is awesome too. Just an extremely well done movie and anyone who hasn't seen it should.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a must have dvd for bodybuilders and also who interested in other sports. This is a classic movie for golden age of bodybuilding. When you watch, you understand bodybuilding as a sport also as a passion. I love it. Arnold is always number one.
0515123447|4.0|The first half of this book is a five star read all of the way. The writing is supurb, the story is crisp, and the mystery unfolding on these pages is unique. Sadly, Child starts to evolve the mystery one small step after another and the story goes way over the top. The story moves from the intense intimate to the world shaking goofiness that so many of today's authors mistakenly tread in. Another thing is the string of coincidences that fall one after another until you start groaning under their weight. At the end I was scratching my head and wondering how Child could have so terribly mangled what started out as what I thought would be one of the very best mystery/thrillers I have yet come across.<br /><br />All of those complaints aside, this is still a very good book. Far-fetched yes, but Child still stands tall as an author here. His prose and his charachters are first class all of the way. Even the silly story is engaging though if you think of the protagonist here prevailing over what is transpiring, it is more than mildly laughable.<br /><br />If you are a thriller junkie like myself, I think that you will very much enjoy this book. Its pretty darn good. And the first half, as I started this review saying, is indeed some of the best genre work that you will come across.
B000683VI4|4.0|Call me crazy, but I have never been one for romantic, sad movies. Sappy, cliched, love stories have never had a place in my heart...which is why I didn't see the raved-over Notebook in theaters. However I heard such amazing reviews by the time it came out in stores that when I saw it on sale at Target I tossed a copy in my red basket.  <br /> <br />That night I watched it and soon was engrossed by the story line. Trying to figure out if the confused old lady with Alzehiemer's was really Allie and if she had really decided to be with Noah was an interesting way to cover up some of the cliches that still prevailed in the love story plot. Also, the fact that the other boy striving for her heart was actually a good person and not some evil golddigger added interest and banished even more of those stubburn cliches.  <br /> <br />Rachel McAdams (Young Allie)stars along with Ryan Gosling (Noah) and McAdams had already proved her acting crediblity to me in my favorite movie, Mean Girls, and others like Red Eye. Both did not disappoint in the Notebook. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie for all,however,guys may not appreciate this smart romance, as I know for a fact that my boyfriend refuses to watch it again and my dad fell asleep while viewing it for the first time.  <br /> <br />Although the movie is sad, and I usually completely shy away from such movies, I put past my chick flick inhibitions and actually really do love the movie.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I must have been one of the very few Depeche Mode fans who liked the low key approach of \\"Exciter.\\" Because \\"Playing The Angel\\" beats such a complete retreat that you would wonder if the band had a creative panic that lasted four years till they had the material together that became \\"Playing The Angel.\\" It sounds like they egg-shell walked through every synth-rock goth cliche that they all but invented and made a - neon capitol letters blinding flashing through a gothic fog here - DEPECHE MODE ALBUM!<br /><br />From the screaming siren call that opens the disc on \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" (to remind us all of those clarions on the cover of \\"Music For The Masses\\"), to the corny subtitle of \\"pain and suffering in various tempos,\\" \\"Playing The Angel\\" feels overtly calculated and obvious sounding. A better title might have been \\"Playing All The Angles.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, it certainly does NOT deserve the one-star slagging some of the more vitriolic reviews have been regurgitating here. Martin Gore still has a knack with a dreary hook, as the fantastic \\"Precious\\" proves. And in a first for DM, David Gahan writes three songs for the CD. Guess what? They sound like Gore's. (\\"Nothing's Impossible\\" is pretty lame, though.) I guess if you're in a band with the same writer for a few decades, it's bound to rub off in a postive way someplace, right?<br /><br />Still, the clunkers here are really smelly, especially the excruciating \\"John The Revelator.\\" And the 'atmospheric' instrumentals sound less like artiness and more like filler. \\"Playing The Angel\\" is not a band going down with the ship. But it is the sound of competent vets doing their best not to rock the boat.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|An excellent CD with excellent tracks.  I relive the movie when I listen to it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I know everyone keeps harping on \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" as the \\"gay cowboy\\" movie, but even as a gay man, there was so much more there that I was watching. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a rare movie that portrays gay men realistically, perhaps one of the very few American Movies to do so. (\\"Philadelphia\\" and \\"Longtime Companion\\" being the other two on a very short list.) Meet any committed couple that lives outside a metro area, and they will relate alot of the same experiences; the false marriages, the children they were terrified of abandoning, the constant fear of being discovered and the sad reconciling to yourself that your life is going to remain a tormented hetro-lie.<br /><br />To that extent, Heath Ledger completely captures the fear and self-terror that so many gay men who don't fit the cliche feel. After having his first explosion of desire in the mountains of Wyoming, he immediately stammers \\"I ain't queer.\\" Ask any gay man over 40 about that incident, and I'd bet you over half could tell you of a similar situation that occurred in their own lives.<br /><br />But \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is, again, of much greater substance than that. The script is an incredible, almost flawless economy of words and nuance. There is barely a wasted sentence or phrase in this movie. In fact, part of the drama is that there are so many long stretches of silence. (The initial meeting between Jack and Ennis, for instance.) The Annie Proulx short story to script adaptation by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana is only deviated from in a couple short segments (Jack Twist's interaction with his in-laws, most notably), with many of the key passages are lifted verbatim. And that is a good thing.<br /><br />Perhaps more than the terrific script is that all the principle actors execute their parts so perfectly. Both Anne Hathaway, who shatters her teeny-pop image as the (at first, anyway) clueless deb that marries Jack, and Michelle Williams, as the long suffering soul that marries Ennis (who does one of the film's many heartbreaking moments as she - without a word - conveys shock, confusion and sudden sadness when she first sees Ennis encounter Jack) stand above their roles. Even the brief appearances (Jack's parents near the movie's end, Randy Quaid as the bloated, bigoted herd-owner) stay completely on target.<br /><br />To that end, it is interesting to note how many of the film's detractors hide their homophobia behind statements like \\"this movie is just about an affair and how it ruins lives.\\" Yes, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is about an affair. But saying that it's just a cheater's movie is like saying that \\"Hamlet\\" is just a ghost story. There is a lot more going on here, the underscore of the forbidden and the tragedy of the unrealized life. When Anne Hathaway describes to Ennis the \\"official\\" story behind the returned letters from Jack while the true circumstances play out in a breif flashback (and thus complete an earlier foreshadowing in the film), you really feel the loss for everyone involved.<br /><br />Again, the triumph of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is its great story about the tragedy of an unrealized life. Funny how something this honest yet true gets hypocritically slammed and ranked from certain theaters, when gratuitous violent swill like \\"Hostel\\" enters moviehouses with an R. Everyone involved with \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" from Director Ang Lee to even the cinematrographers (who do a great job of making Canada look like the American Mid-West) deserve all the kudos being lavished upon them.heartbreaking moments as she - without a word - conveys shock, confusion and sudden sadness when she first sees Ennis encounter Jack) stand above their roles.

Again, the triumph of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is its great story about the tragedy of an unrealized life. Funny how something this honest yet true gets hypocritically slammed and ranked from certain theaters, when gratuitous violent swill like \\"Hostel\\" enters moviehouses with an R. Everyone involved with \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" from Director Ang Lee to even the cinematrographers (who do a great job of making Canada look like the American Mid-West) deserve all the kudos being lavished upon them.
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|Okay, I was VERY skeptical of this remaking of P&P. First off, feature films rarely do a good job of interpreting a book into a 2 hour film (I thought Zefferelli's Jane Eyre was just dreadful!). I also questioned the casting of Keira Knightley as one of literature's most beloved heroines, Elizabeth Bennett. I really didn't think she could pull it off. But she really did.  <br /> <br />I'm one of those fans that hold up the BBC/A&E mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as the gold standard as adaptations go. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best I'd seen to-date and I treasure my DVD copy. And so, it was with fairly low expectations that I went to see this film. But I must say that I was pretty impressed. The setting, as others have pointed out, was of a much more rural world where people got dirty and farm animals wander about in the front yard. I thought the depictions of the Bennett sisters were well done particularly Jena Malone's silly Lydia, Rosamund Pike just luminescent as Jane and Ms Knightly's fine job as Elizabeth. Brenda Blethyn was a much less flighty Mrs Bennett from the BBC version which was welcome. But I was not that wild about Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Mr Bennett. He seemed more willfully neglectful of his daughters than the more benign neglect depicted in the BBC version.  <br /> <br />As for the men, I know that for many Colin Firth IS Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's played him twice after all) but I found Matthew MacFadyen's portrayal more nuanced and sensitive, almost vulnerable than the more cool and haughty Firth version. I loved him! MacFadyen interprets Darcy's reserve not as superior hauteur so much as a sort of shyness. MacFadyen's Darcy seems to be a shy man who is uncomfortable with strangers and, perhaps, in his own skin. He's attracted to Elizabeth because she is everything he's not. She's totally comfortable with who she is and her place in the world even if she is often stifled by the social strictures of her day. Charles Bingley was portrayed as a boyish innocent and one could see why Darcy felt he had to look out for him. I really felt that the Caroline Bingley character was pretty inconsequential seemingly only there to give Jane the excuse to visit. But one never got the impression that Caroline even liked Jane in this version so that part was not very well done. I must confess that the portrayal of Mr Collins had me smiling with serious bemusement! He wasn't the buffoonish comic relief so much as a bit of an oddity! But the biggest surprise was what a small part George Wickham played in this story.  <br /> <br />And that is my biggest issue with the film. Other than Mr MacFadyen, Ms Knightly is the star around which everyone else orbits and as a result, everyone else comes off as fairly minor secondary characters. As expected, some events are missing or time periods compressed to fit the time requirements of the film. I suppose it's as faithful as a feature film could be, but it does sort of boil the book down to just the romance between Lizzie and Darcy. Other issues I had were some of the costuming which would have been inappropriate at the time. The almost slip dress that Caroline Bingley wears to the Netherfield ball would have been positively scandalous in the day (a night gown would have shown less skin!). And gloves would have been worn by both ladies and gentlemen at any social occasion. And there was also a scene where Lizzie and her sister are shopping in the village and her hair is down around her shoulders. A young lady of the day would never appear in public without her hair being put up! And I was very disappointed in the lackluster Lady Catherine DeBurgh this version offered. Judi Dench is fine, but she lacks the amusingly pompous condescension Lady Catherine had in the book and in the BBC version. She plays her too regally as my sister pointed out!  <br /> <br />Ah well, nothing in life is perfect, but bottom line, I enjoyed this adaptation and have added the DVD to my shopping card.  Highly recommended!  <br />
B000B0WODA|4.0|While Franz Ferdinand made one of 1983's best albums with their 2004 debut, they obviously had to be aware that you can only ride the goodwill train of hype for so long. Which means that they had to pull on all the creative resources they could muster to guarantee a successful follow-up. \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" delivers in spades.<br /><br />From the oddly political opener of \\"The Fallen\\" to the Blur/Beatles trip of \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On,\\" this CD finds the Ferds skipping the sophomore slump and delivering an album that puts the world on notice that there may be enough to the band that they'll have a full-on career. \\"YCHISMB\\" is also a darker album than the debut, with the ballads showing serious growth past the novelty of their post-punk roots. Both cocky (\\"Evil and a Heathen\\") and self-doubting (especially \\"Fade Together\\"), this is the kind of rock that would be all over MTV in its golden age. FF drops chewy hooks like on the inescapable \\"Do You Want To,\\" and \\"This Boy\\" with snappy choruses and chunky guitar hooks that just cream with perfect pop-confectionaries.<br /><br />And the fact that the \\"YCHISMB\\" delves into the sardonic side of pop that made FF's debut such a delight without sounding like a complete retread (entered into evidence: \\"Room On Fire\\") makes me love them even more. The kiss-off of \\"Walk Away\\" - and \\"no buildings will fall down, no quake will split the ground\\" - or the glib religious sneer of \\"I break this bottle and think of you fondly\\" are indications of potential brilliance to come.
B00005JOIF|5.0|\\"Munich\\" may sound like either a depressing and violent drama to some people, and to others it may sound like a stupid revenge thriller. When I first heard about the movie, I scoffed at the very idea. I thought it would be distastefull to market a movie off the unfortunate people that lost their lives in the Munich Massacre. As it turns out, the movie is alot better that anyone could have anticipated. It has scenes of almost funny innocence between the five assassins, and then sequences of violent assassinations almost a second later. <br /> <br />One of the good things about \\"Munich\\" is that is doesn't ever try to be something it's not. It never tries to be an action movie, and rightfully it shouldn't be one. However, it rather naturally forms into one on the later half with three extended shootout sequences. As soon as the word \\"raid\\" was mentioned, I rolled my eyes and thought \\"Great, another great movie that takes a nose dive in the last half!\\" But that's not what happened. Instead they felt important to the plot, as did everything else in the movie. Except the nudity. <br /> <br /> <br />Now, I'm not sure whether this was some symbolism (all violence, in the end, is stripped down to nothing, therefore worth nothing?) or maybe Speilberg, after a long string of PG-13 movies, may have gotten a little...I don't want to say perverted...crazy? I'm not really sure, but the movie incorporates nudity into three, count them three, violent scenes. In one a man is shot and they show it all. In another a woman is shot and when a man tries to cover her with a robe, another man  tells him not to, revealing everything. In another scene, a bomb goes off in a hotel, blowing out the walls to adjacent hotel rooms. A woman in one of the rooms is topless as she runs out of the hotel. As hard as I tried I found nothing that related to the lot with these scenes. But anywho. <br /> <br />\\"Munich\\" seems to have a mordant sense of humor, which fits well here. In one scene, a fellow assassin congratulates the team leader, Avner (Eric Bana), on the birth of his child. \\"Mozeltov\\", says the man, continuing on. \\"Oh, and by the way. The doctor succumbed to his wounds. Once again. Mozeltov.\\" In a scene towards the end, Avner and his wife are in bed and he flahes back to the Munich Massacre, incorporating his face onto one of the assassins and one of the victims. This wan't so much funny as creepy, but I felt it was worth a mention. <br /> <br />The plot of \\"Munich\\" follows five Mossad agents sent to dispatch all eleven people responsible for the 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre. The five men are Avner, the leader of the group, Steve (Daniel Craig), the getaway driver, Carl (Ciaran Hines), Robert (Matheiu Kassovitz), the bomb maker, and Hans (Hanns Zischler). The movie takes it's time getting to the main plot, because when the movie enters the third hour there are still two people to get rid of. The group travels throughout Europe, killing the planners of the tragedy. Most of this is done with guns, although they have been urged by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) to use bombs. But that idea seems to be dropped after Avner is almost blown to bits early in the movie. <br /> <br />Speilberg spends the first twenty minutes of the movie on the kidnapping of the athletes, their hostage taking, and the subsequent trip to the airport. These twenty minutes are stark and feel very real. There is an eery image of a man in a ski mask walking out onto the balcony of one of the dormatories that is now infamous. Speilberg makes this all the eerier as we see it from inside the dormatory. Throughout the scene we hear several news commentators giving their perspective on what is going on, which is at some times sadly off the mark, but ironically funny at the same time. As the camera focuses on the bullet ridden body of an athlete we hear a newscaster say \\"We are told all of the athletes are alright, and will be until an attempt is made to rescue them.\\" <br /> <br />Later in the opening, the athletes are taken to the Munich airport, where they were killed later that morning. What we see (at first-later in the movie, towards the end, we see the killings) is an explosian and a newscaster saying that all the terrorists have been killed. Seconds later, we see a grainy news clip of Jim McKay broadcasting, announcing \\"They're all gone.\\" This is by far one of the best sequences in the movie, totally surpassing the second best one in the movie, the great sequence at the airport at the end. In the scene, which is done with no dialogue, the terrorists try to get away with the hostages but fail, resulting in the deaths of all the hostages and many of the kidnappers. Mayhem breaks out, and it shows how what should have gone smoothly was screwed by a shoddy attempt at a rescue. For a much better, but one sided, view of the situation itself, not the aftermath, the documentry \\"21 Hours In Munich\\" will probably give you what you want and a little more. I enjoyed it, but I liked this more. <br /> <br />This is the best movie of the year and here's why. The acting is flawless, right down to a great scene where Avner speaks to his daughter over the phone for the first time (\\"You never forget daddy's voice. Never. You may never know daddy, but you'll know his voice.\\") The direction is great, with no overly dizzying camera movements, and the lighting is first class, dark when it needs to be but still very easy to see. The assassination planning scenes do get a bit old after, like, the fifth time, but there are only I think six so it doesn't have time to wear to bad. I think that if you give the movie a chance, and go in with an open mind, you will love it, <br /> <br />Running Time: 2 Hours And 46 Minutes <br /> <br />Rated: R (Extremely graphic and bloody, as well as realistic, violence includes headshots, a stabbing, bombings, a severed limb, shootouts with bloody shootings, beatings, a suicide, Strong profanity, Sexual scenes (one mixes sex with violent flashbacks), Nudity, and Drug use.
B0007P3582|1.0|This is just awful. Words can not express how much I hate this man and his \\"music\\". Not worth your time or money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why they cut this is still beyond me, and why they don't bring it back an even greater tragedy. This DVD is fantastic including the bonus footage.  I recommend this to anyone who knows Joss Whedon is a genius.
B000000H7I|5.0|This record is extremely hard to find, but when you get it, it will be worth the trouble. As long as death metal exists (hopefully forever), this gem will always be as brutal and relevant as it was the day it was released.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the best series you never saw.  Full of heart and humor, character-centric and clever-dialogue-rich. A science fiction series without aliens, and still the most entertaining sci fi to come down the pike in decades.  I'm a die hard Stargate fan, and I love this one as much, if not more. There are 13 &lt;?> episodes in all, all included in this set, and not a stinker in the bunch.  They are well worth watching again and again.  You'll come to know and love the gang as much as I have and you too may be buying more sets to give away.  The extras included are priceless for those who have seen the series and just want to delve more into it.  If you think you saw it on TV, this is so much better.  Crystal clear, wide screen and the commentaries are to die for.  I'd buy it again at twice the price.
B000000OSG|5.0|After thoroughly listening to this record and Appetite for Destruction for some time now, I've come to the conclusion that this album is superior. Don't get me wrong, I love AFD as much as the next guy, but if I had to choose one GN'R album to take with me on a deserted island (cliche, I know), it would be UYI 2.         On Appetite for Destruction, you had twelve cutting-edge, in-your-face rockers and ballads that gave the \\"hair metal\\" scene a facelift. The musicianship was tight, production was stellar (considering it was the 80's), Slash was-and is-God, and the album recieved massive radio airplay and drew in legions of die-hard fans. But even with all the aforementioned to their credit, Guns N' Roses was missing something...        That is until, the Use Your Illusion albums were released simultaneously in September 1991. Upon purchasing these records, many fans noticed that some of the songs were much longer and more complex (some of them overblown i.e. \\"Estranged\\", still by FAR the best song on the record, oddly) than on AFD, this mainly due to Axl's increasing superiorty complex, the band hiring keyboardist/pianist Dizzy Reed (Axl also plays piano on these records, and he is quite good) and firing drummer Steven Adler (replaced with the superior Matt Sorum). Fans were also surprised (or at least I was) to hear rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin  sing lead vocals on UYI 1's \\"Dust and Bones\\", and it's evil twin, \\"14 Years\\", on UYI 2. Bassist Duff McKagan also sings on \\"So Fine\\".         The reason I am submitting a review for only UYI 2 and not UYI 1 is that frankly, the ladder album blows the former out of the water. Sure, \\"November Rain\\" is a beautiful ballad and \\"Live And Let Die\\" is a decent cover, but when you have songs like \\"Estranged, \\"Civil War\\", \\"You Could Be Mine\\", \\"Locomotive\\", \\"14 Years\\" and \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" on the same record, that's pretty tough to top. AFD may have the attitude and image, but UYI 2  has the depth to explore beyond that image.
B000005Z0E|5.0|This is his most political album and a pretty good album. He raps made up stories about racism in a store while trying to buy a bag of chips and racism from the police. Coinsidently he was later beaten by the police. He raps about teenage pregnancies, poverty, violence in the ghetto and by the police, drugs, betrayel and how we need to better ourselves and the state of living. This isn't his first recording tho.

0156027321|3.0|I just reread this adventure story - just to make sure that I had not missed any of the supposedly clever writing and profound innterpretations that contributed to the Booker Price. Well, I don't think I did - I just don't see what it is that is so clever about it. Yes, I think I see what is supposed to be clever; yet, I felt it somewhat contrived and artificial.<br /><br />The story is worth the read, mostly because it IS different.  I did not particularly enjoy it -not because of the somewhat tedious castaway adventure, but more because the very writing deterioated and lost most of its initial nerve and color. The first part of the book is the best, and I genuinely enjoyed the story, the descriptions, the existential ponderings of the protagonist as well as the unique peek into the backyards of zoos. Pi Patel in his native India is delightful (the story about how he aquired his name is quite touching and humorous); however, the castaway story with Pi and the Bengal Tiger, Richard Parker, in the life boat gradually became not just dreary, but artificial. In addition, the image of Tom Hank in the Castaway movie constantly came to mind...and I did not care for that movie either...<br /><br />The final part of the book that deals with the Japanese investigators (who neatly sum up most of the symbolism that you might have missed) seems too forced. The reader quite predictably is asked to ponder the credibility of the story - just like religion it requires a \\"leap of faith\\" - but the whole premise of the story does not quite match up to its supposed significance...<br /><br />I left the story wishing to read more about Pi in India!

B000002HRE|3.0|Well here you go the new Metallica. The era where Metallica went more slower and cut their hair. The whole hair thing never really botherd me it was Metallica's new sound. Load was an okay album so when Reload came out I wasn't expecting much. No amazing solos, or heavy druming on this album yet again. But however there are some songs that stand out and make this album better than Load. Fuel, and the Memory Remains are some pretty heavy tracks from Metallica. Another good song is The Unforgiven II. The album has more of an alternative sound to it and somewhat of a metal sound. With Metallica being still one of my favorite bands I give them credit. And hey it's way better than St. Anger. In fact all of their albums are probably better than that album. Lets hope Metallica brings back thrash metal.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|This movie is arguably better than the first.  It doesn't change any facts from the previous movie.  Where the first movie focused on character development for Buzz, this one gives us a little more of Woody.<br /><br />The DVD extras are well worth it.  I highly suggest the Outtakes.  Those are always a laugh.  Also check out the intro about the new character Wheezy.
0131103628|5.0|This is probably the best programming book around now. I started programming in 'C' with this book. I had little experience with C++ and figured why not go ahead and learn c and then move on to the more complicated things in c++. I loved the way this book was written. It has (seriously) to the point examples, nothing more, nada. In the introduction it states that this book mainly focuses on the language and tries not to be an introduction to algorithms and data structures. This is true but to they fill you in with some useful algorithms (such as the famous 'quicksort') through the examples which is one of the best things (for me) about this book.  <br /> <br />I believe that you can learn c as your first programming language from this book (with preferably a little background in programming such as knowing the compiling process). Just work through the examples and use some internet sources as needed. <br />The only one true thing that I had trouble understanding only using the content of this book was bitwise operators. After citing cprogramming.com, (and having a little background in assembly) I found that the numbers are broken down int binary numbers and then bitwise operations were performed. (I had to translate 077 into binary to figure out what it meant by setting the lower order 7 bits). <br /> <br />Though the price is a little steep, this is a great book and I highly recommend it.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|David Bowie makes another masterpiece! It has some of his best-known songs like Ashes To Ashes And Fashion! My personal favorites are Teenage Wildlife, Kingdom Come, Fashion, Ashes To Ashes, Scary Monsters, and It's No Game pt2(Pt1 is...interesting). But the whole album is great! It may not match up to Diamond Dogs or Low, but I still consider it to be a materpiece! My most listened to song on Scary Monsters would have to be Teenage Wildlife. I just think it's the catchiest little thing I've ever heard! Go out and buy Scary Monsters!
B0002XDODU|5.0|After a very long wait of more than 2 years finally they have come up with an album mind blowing.....This is for all the hard rock, metal, heavy thrash music listeners, if you fall in any of these music categories believe me you don't wanna miss this album, although all the lyrics are in german language, the music itself speaks the global language of hard rock!!.... <br /> <br />if you already like rammstein then this album is worth spending money i would rate it better than previous two.. <br /> <br />Thier last few albums like mutter and sensucht had pretty great reviews too....almost 9 out of 10 songs on those albums were great...so i was really worried about them comin out with a new one would probably have 1 or 2 good numbers and rest just experiments....but eventually i was wrong....i found almost all of the songs mind blowing new kinf of music....even if they are experiments they'r pretty well concieved...for any metal music lover i would recommend this album... <br /> <br />even though i dont know german language that much but i could understand the lyrics a lil bit as ive been listening to german music for a while.... <br /> <br />i love the song reise reise which is also the title song for the album.....some other ones like mein teil, keine lust, Los, moskau, stein um stein are pretty cool!!....

0316168815|3.0|The one thing that many of the negative reviews have in common is that The Lovely Bones fails to live up to its potential.  The first half is engaging and entertaining.  But the second half is a huge disappointment.  It's a common enough weakness.  The Historian, The Time Traveler's Wife and Forever are just three quick examples that come to mind in terms of a very promising beginning that ultimately leads to a big let down.  Not terrible, but, in my opinion, certainly not worthy of the glowing reviews.
B000002B5L|5.0|Here it is Feb 1, 2006, and I'm still bumping this album, like it's the first day it came out.  The Fugees made me believe in Hip Hop again, in being black proud and conscious, in revolution.  There is absolutely NOTHING in Hip Hop today that even comes close to the essence of this album, lol, except Lauryn's MISEDUCATION and Wyclef's CARNIVAL.  Now look at Hip Hop (my bad), whatever you call this mess now, definitely not Hip Hop.  Come on Fugees, bring on that next album.  Please SAVE Hip Hop, PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
B00027JZ3E|4.0|Lost Boys...  being one of my favorite movies of all time, I love the cast, the plot and even the bad clich's.  With this dvd's features you can go behind the scenes it actually has footage of the cast then and now (as if you didn't know what happened to the \\"Coreys\\")  Deleted scenes, a music video, etc.  It's almost everything a fan could want.  I would've loved a commentary by the cast but I guess you can't have everything.  Definitely something for an 80's child or movie buff.

B000BTDMDC|4.0|From: &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\"> [music]^2 - Music Reviews&lt;/a> <br /> <br />I'll be taking a look at Arctic Monkeys' debut album - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not . In case you know nothing about the band, here is a little synopsis. The band's first single topped the U.K. singles charts and their U.K. debut album outsold the rest of their fellow bands including the U.K. Top 20 combined; as in, take ranks 2 - 20 and add their sales together...Arctic Monkeys win hands down. That's an impressive stat to boast no matter who you are but in the end it is exactly just that: a statistic. <br /> <br /> <br />I will be frank with everyone who reads this vignette; I imagined, before having listened to the album, that I would begin this review with blurbs like, \\"Does anyone want to buy a 1999 Ford Mustang? I am selling mine to move to Sheffield and erect an Arctic Monkeys temple, a la the Who's \\"Tommy\\", to help spread the word of the Arctic Ones.\\" I have to say it is a shame I don't feel that way, because that is top-notch, quality journalism; as you can see, a good journalist will find a way to include whatever he needs to include. Now, don't get me wrong, I am by no means saying that the Arctic Monkeys CD is a bad one. Are they the next Oasis, as some people are saying? No, they are not. Are they the next Strokes? Maybe, and that is a questionable maybe. <br /> <br /> <br />The album suffers from what I will now refer to as \\"Hit Single Syndrome\\" or H.S.S for short. H.S.S is the phenomenon that occurs when a song does really well, so well that the entire rest of the album must follow that exact format in hopes of maintaining appeal with those who liked the single and it worked. The album sounds a lot like the single, which is a good song to its merit, and those who liked it, went out and bought the crap out of their album. Everyone made a lot of money, except probably the Arctic Monkeys, and everyone is happy, right? Not always the case. The songs are hardly distinguishable from each other if you tune out the lyrics they are singing. <br /> <br /> <br />The album does though contain 13 good songs which are arranged excellently and are just great songs to listen to; the album though, lacks that handful of exceptional songs to escalate it to a truly substantial status. It also severely limits it replay ability. The album is a general synopsis of \\"Good Music\\" but it isn't anything genre-shaking, and nothing on the album makes me want to play it repeatedly. I had hopes of this album being the, \\"Antics\\" by Interpol, which I have been looking for and still am looking for; when I find that album it will receive 5 stars and you will know about it. Whereas \\"The Subways\\" received four stars for a debut album filled with a majority of good songs, a few mediocre ones, and a few exceptional ones, this album receives the same rating for a consistent album of good songs; the album contained no songs which I did not like but it also contained none that I loved. <br /> <br /> <br />If you liked the single and are looking for more variations of the single then buy this album and you will not be disappointed. If you were looking for something more from the band, then you might have to wait for a sophomore release. Either way, we will hear more from this group as well and I hope for growth or at least a regaining of the musical-control-reigns from whomever has them in their grasp right now. With this album, I recommend if you have any interest at all, just buy the album and see for yourself. You'll either love it, or be content at the worst. <br /> <br />
006441034X|5.0|I read this book for the first time years ago. I loved it then and I love it now. I was super excited when I heard that someone made a movie of it, but was a little sad to see how much the characters I know and love have been changed. The movie is good as a separate entity but the book is amazing. Someone said in one of the reviews that Howl is a playboy, but he's under a spell for the majority of the book. Also the characters DO get angry, how can someone even say that after reading Howl's reaction to his unfortunate hair disaster (well it was for him). The emotions are very real, the characters believable, and this is quite possibly one of my favorite books. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it, and the movie too. But do yourself a favor and read the book first.

I would recmmend this one for sure!
0143034901|3.0|On the on hand, Shadow of the Wind is an incredibly exciting read. The storyline flows with enough suspense to keep the reader engaged throughout. My disappointment came toward the end. Most of the story was untangled in one single revelation that was just way too convenient. Unfortunately, Zafon did not take enough time and effort to properly untangle the web he so masterfully woven. Oh, and I also had a slight problem with an all-too-happy end.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This was awesome, the director's cut, and the original, all on one dvd. The whole concept people who judge this film because it's not a concert, they were there to create an atmosphere of sound in the whole arena, and it worked. That's why I liked it so much the songs fit the mood like 'Echoes' to start off with, because it did echoed all over that place. Next was 'Careful With That Axe Eugene', you can feel Waters really stretching the vocals to the point a volcano would erupt violently. Next we got 'Saucerful Of Secrets', the name itself explains it all, and when you mix Pink Floyd, and a place of ruins, it works there too. One Of These Days, well it's better on 'Meddle', but Mason really lays into those pig skins now don't he. Mademoiselle Nobs is probally my least favorite, but good effort with the greyhound. I like how they do a flip back and forth with pictures of distruction from Pompeii with the song 'Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun', they show figures on which almost human like from the ashes of that city that fell victim so many years ago from a violent volcano. Last but not least an Echoes reprise, and sending you back into space again, only to long for the next Pink Floyd appearance.
0823023494|5.0|I ordered this book before it was released and it is worth far more than the cover price.  As an illustrator I have always struggled a little with character design, and this book filled the void.  It has a good combination of pictures and text so both learning style are met.  After you read this book, you will understand many of the principles and techniques to design characters.  You won't work for Capcom tomorrow, but your art will look a lot better.
B000002GBD|5.0|I can remember a time in my life when I thought AC/DC did this, pathetic huh?%#@$ Well it makes somewhat sense I was young and 'Hair Of The Dog' came on the radio and that's who I thought it was, well anyways 15 years go by and I picked this up on vinyl, boy I wore a groove thru this album, so to CD I went, I got, superb, encore, bravo. The whole album jams, if you like Sabbath, AC/DC, or even Motorhead this might be a good album to grasp, which includes 'Miss Misery' 'Love Hurts' Changin' Times' Beggars Day, hell even Whisky Drinkin' Woman, which doesn't sound like anything else really on this track but still sounds good. And of course 'Don't Judas Me', like I said everything on this album registers. This is a good album to hang out and drink with, I recommend it.
B00005JNRE|4.0|Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson, who also wrote the screenplay) arrives at Casa Brown: wide of hip, warted of face, thick of hips, full of bosom, uni of brow and snaggle of tooth...not a second too late as widower Cedric Brown (a hapless but cheery Colin Firth) has just lost his 17th. Nanny and the Nanny Placement Center have closed its doors to him and his rowdy 7 children.<br />McPhee seemingly sent from Nanny Heaven uses a combination of magic and common sense to teach and coach all of the Brown children plus Mr. Brown himself into being the best people they can be.<br />\\"Nanny McPhee\\" owes a lot both psychologically and physically to movies as varied as \\"Willie Wonka\\" and, dare I say this: \\"Mary Poppins.\\" And in a performance that I would have to call bizarrely yet subtly understated, Emma Thompson chews up the scenery with a damask napkin on her lap and a bone china teacup in her hand.<br />\\"Nanny McPhee\\" is fun and the production is almost psychedelic in its use of big bold colors: the Brown entryway is a burst of red, white and blue and Mr. Brown's home office is chartreuse and fuchsia....a feast for the eyes.
B00005JOFO|5.0|What some guys don't understand about this movie, considering it flat and a big \\"let down\\", is that Brokeback Mountain doesn't follow the rule of traditional storytelling in cinema, praised and analyzed by experts like Bob Mckee, I mean a story with twist and turns, poin of no return, acts, a final and clear message, etc.  <br />This is a movie, a story in the tradition of the great literature of the nineteenth century, especially russian, Chekhov or Tolstoy to be more specifically. It's the complete opposite of the storyline from Crash, for example(a movie that might win the Oscar, against the odds, exactly because is against the odds and it will be a huge campaign for not voting Brokeback Mountain but voting Crash from now on). <br /> I mean, here, in Brokeback, if someone tells you some words about the story, there are no surprises. You know from the beginning that this guys are going to meet there, make sex, fall in love, and keep their relantionship for 20 years. A down ending and period. No twists, no turns, no surprises. But this is the point here, that is why Brokeback Mountain is a great movie.Brokeback Mountain is  how life it is, how real life is. No coincidences here(there are so many and disturbing in Crash), no deus ex machina solutions.  <br />The only coincidence is thet these two guys meet there, these particular guys, but this is the amount of coincidence that we have regulary in our life. Remember how we met our loved ones, for all of us it was more or less a coincidence, a thing that IT WAS MEANT TO BE. So that is great about Proulx, but especially for the screenwriters and for Ang Lee, they don't fall for a cheap twist, for a Hollywood like surprise ending, for a gratuitous revelation,kept secret late into the movie.  <br />They just show, like Tolstoy in his short stories, like Chekhov, that life is like that. You have a chance to free yourself, to make love a force of nature, you don't take it, you have to take the consequences. That's what Ennis does. Life is a down ending, everybody dies, love comes to you, time passes, you have to give love, to receive it, to get close to a meaning, if there is a meaning at all for life.  <br />The philosophy of the movie is just great, first class, at the level of the great literature.  <br />The endlees talking about how to define this movie (is it gay, is it more than that, is a love story,etc.) is less important. The important thing about this movie the substance within, the consistence, the groundbreaking attitude of the filmmakers, the great, great attitude of the actors.  <br />
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Opon first listen to this CD it was very quick in its delivery, so it took a few listens to really get a bit more hooked on it. Not many of the songs clock at over 5 minutes, perhaps none, so intially it will seem that way at first However this is a very good way to get the listener to go back and play it again and again, clever clever they are. So basically its a bit heavier and darker than Mesmerize, much more actually. Mes, is more upbeat old happy school SOS, and this one is the more Toxicity(ish) cover the world in demented gloom type albums. So you get the best of both worlds with both albums. I myself listen more to bands like Nevermore, Into Eternity, Overkill, The Haunted etc., more obscure bands, however SOS are a breath of fresh air when it comes to the more Commercialized side of Rock/Metal. As with Godsmack, Disturbed, Unearthed, and some of the newer metal acts SOS deliver a uniqueness that some or no bands can mimic, which in this day of the dismal Music Industry is hard to come by. So THUMBS UP! for Hyp.
B00003W8NM|5.0|After Watching Fight Club I realized that I could relate to the movie. Now I don't mean I am able to relate to blowing up my own apartment or starting a seceret fight club in the basement of a bar or causing havoc all around the nation, no, I mean alot of the thinking that Narrator does in the movie I have thought the same to some extent as well. Fight Club is a wonderful movie when you see it the first time. However it is a thinking movie, meaning don't watch it with a bunch of your friends because youre bound to miss many important little details in the movie. Tyler Durden is by far my favorite when it comes to movie characters; His views on modern day society, specifically pertaining to the U.S. are views I can relate to and also find myself as a part of those views. To quote Tyler Durden \\"We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.\\" The movie takes you on a wonderful roller coaster of feelings and emotions, towards both Narrator and Tyler Durden. i believe this is one of Brad Pitt's best roles ever and I think a lot of people, when they think of Brad Pitt they also think Tyler Durden. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone and they should probably go out and buy the movie because It will more than likely make their top 10.  <br />

Amazing vocals and great energy. My favourite yet!
B0002GTWYW|5.0|One of the best rap albums of all time (in my humble opinion).  Tupac def. deserves respect for thought-provoking lyrics, but Biggie will always be number one in my book because he has charisma in his raps and I think that counts for alot in the public eye. <br /> <br />If you like these, I would check out the new Duets album that provide more Biggie covers.. but naturally there is nothing like the real thing!
0393327655|5.0|When someone claims something preposterous, unsupported by fact, out of wishful thinking and/or ignorance, we don't have to respect those claims. There is no reason religious faith should be an exception, argues the author. Faith is not worthy of respect in a conversation.<br /><br />More importantly, Sam Harris makes the point that if we bend over backwards not to offend religious moderates, and the latter do the same not to offend religious fundamentalists (as you've noticed they inevitably do!), we're just freeing the way for the cancerous growth of fundamentalism, with the associated<br /><br />suicide-bombings and other fun stuff.<br /><br />This is an excellent book making the point that faith is positively harmful and could well spell the end of our world (think a bit about nuclear weapons in the hands of religious fanatics).<br /><br />The only part that left me quizzed is the chapter about mysticism and meditation: Sam Harris may be onto something, but I really am at a loss figuring out what he's talking about.<br /><br />Apart from that, the style of the author is crystal clear, brief, concise, admirably articulate.<br /><br />Make sure you check out [...] it has very interesting print, audio, and video material.<br /><br />And buy the book; and promote the cause!
B00005JMXX|1.0|I can't really justify spending much time criticizing this movie. Life is simply too short. I can, however, envision how the picture's script was written: The writers sat around watching bad disaster movies, a la MST3K, while drinking vast quantities of beer. They copied every bit of corny dialog from every low-brow hollywood disaster opera, and then ground out their own script in this fermentatious atmosphere. The only line missing is \\"We'll attack at noon, Earth Time.\\" Wait, I think that one's in there!
0895260131|1.0|Let me first start off by giving a few quotes about Islam from famous people like the author did in his book. As a side note, the quote by Winston Churchill in the book was removed from his book by Churchill himself.<br /><br />Mahatma Gandhi in 'Young India,'1924<br />....\\" I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle.\\"<br /><br />Thomas Carlyle in 'Heroes and Hero Worship and the Heroic in History,' 1840<br />\\"The lies (Western slander) which well-meaning zeal has heaped round this man (Muhammad) are disgraceful to ourselves only.\\"<br /><br />Washington Irving 'Mahomet and His Successors'<br /> \\"In his private dealings he was just. He treated friends and strangers, the rich and poor, the powerful and weak, with equity, and was beloved by the common people for the affability with which he received them, and listened to their complaints.\\"<br /><br />To call the Prophet Muhammad a terrorist for leading a war (just war) is like calling Jesus gay for not marrying. It is not fair. No muslim has ever made a book or even a deragatory comment about Jesus, but there are hundereds of books that throw dirt on Islam's holy Prophet and the religion of Islam. This book is one of them.<br /><br />Islam does not oppress women. Pakistan may oppress women. Iran may oppress women. Afhganistan may oppress women. But Islam as religion does not oppress women. The number of women a man could marry before Islam was unlimited, Islam limited the # to 4 and said \\"If you cant be fair to all of them, then marry only 1.\\" Islam gives the women the right to accept or reject a marriage. Bukhari V 7, Book 62/67 Islam gave women the right to own property. Islam also stopped the burying of female babies.<br />Although people from Muslim countries abuse women, they are following their own culture and not Islam. For more on women in islam go to<br />[...]<br /><br />About violence in the Quran: There are a handfull of verses that seem to advocate violence. One of them is 9:5  \\"Kill the non-believers where ever you find them.\\" At face value, it sounds like a terror slogan, but the verse before it says to not harm those idolators whom you have a treaty with and the end of 9:5 says \\"But if they repent, then leave them alone.\\"<br /><br />If the US army in Iraq had British soldiers turn against them and start killing US soldiers and Congress passed a law that said: \\"Kill the British wherever you find them\\" and if they lay down their weapons, then leave them alone. Would any American disagree with this law and allow Americans to continue dying?<br /><br /> About the Crusades being defensive: The first Crusade by Christians killed nearly 1/3 of the entire Jewish population in Germany and France. There were a total of 8 Crusades that killed more than 1 million people. The Western and Eastern Church made an official apology 900 years later for the Crusades. Go to this site for more<br />[...]<br /><br />To further put the nail in the coffin, let me show how the author decieves people in the first chapter of his book. He obviously distorts  sayings of the Prophet and uses them when they are not accepted as authentic by all Muslims. He even uses one that is nowhere to be found on page 12, \\"Kill any Jew that falls into your power\\". Notice there is no reference after the quote, which is the case with many other quotes. But the main lie of this chapter comes on pg 17, where the Author says the Prophet broke a treaty when he accepted a woman who fled from Mecca.This woman came to Madinah and Her relatives came to take her back and they told the Prophet to stick to the treaty. However, the Prophet replied back saying that the treaty only said that escaping MEN should be returned and the treaty mentions nothing about women who escape. The blessed prophet was known to the people, before he ever became a prophet, as the \\"Honest One\\". The only liar is Robert Spencer.<br /><br />If you have any question or doubt about Islam, I advise you to go these sites:<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]returned and the treaty mentions nothing about women who escape.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|Ok, so it's not the typical music you're used to from John, get over it! This is what John Mayer should have been doing all along. This effort shows where the artist's true passion is and the inspiration that made him the excellent and talented guitar player he is today. It's certainly not a rip off of the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan as one other reviewer seems to think. While SRV's music certainly shares some of the same influences, and John is certainly influenced by Stevie (as he freely admits), this is nothing like the vast majority of SRV material. SRV was in a league of his own and if John wants to take take some of that influence and use it as a catalyst to produce the kind of music that he loves then I am all for it. I sincerely hope John continues down this path he has embarked upon.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|When I first heard one of their songs I really thought it was Fall Out Boy but then I was told otherwise. It didn't take me long, however, to simply fall in love with this cd. They are very straight foward with their lyrics and I absolutly love that I can dance to the songs. I have found myself singing number seven over and over again. Everything about the cd is so good regardless of the fact that it's kinda of creepy how much the lead singer sounds like  fall out boy. I completely recommend this Panic! at the disco to anyone who loves to dance and is ready for some in your face lyrics.

B000A7Q2DM|1.0|30 seconds to mars had a great thing going. They had a unique lyrics with analogies to myths and space. They had extremely powerful guitars, great vocals, and a totally different sound. It was a deep and heavy debut that combined melody, heavy echoeing guitars, with a spacey electronic component for a unmistable sound. I expected greatness on a \\"a beautiful lie\\". It was possibly my biggest waste of 20$ on a cd to date. I know a band is supposed to evolve and grow, but killing all the intensity and power to make this weak cd was not a great idea. After listening to the cd, with my mouth wide open in dissapointment and horrible surprise, i realized that i could not remember one guitar line, one bellowing scream, or one hynotizing atmospheric moment that i came to expect after the debut. The music just seems to be there, it does not stand out and grab your attention in any way. It merely just plays and plays while your mind wanders off desperately trying to find something interesting to immerse itself in.  I even gave this band another listen thinking, maybe it will grow me, but the cd does not pick up at any point and the only highlight i can put is the cool sounding electronic element for the first 10 seconds of ATTACK, after that i suggest you take this cd out and either put in their debut, or something cool from maynard james keenan.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This is an excellent movie with good casting, story, special effects, camera work, music, and sets. If you enjoy movies like Gladiator, The 13th Warrior, Troy, Robin Hood, et cetera you will probably enjoy this movie. Our main character played by Bloom finds himself in a ackward predicament in protecting the crown and being infatuated with a beautiful young lady. A great deal of epic battle scenes, knightly honor, and court intrigue make this well worth a look. It may not have been a big hit at the box office, but it certainly merits at least a rental. I didn't catch it at the theater, but after renting it I ended up buying it.
B0000033P2|5.0|After _Brain Salad Surgery_, ELP gets real spotty, but _Trilogy_ is before _Brain Salad_ so it is certainly not spotty.  In my mind, though, it just doesn't have the same level of panache as the other early ones.  Mind you, it has absolutely brilliant moments, one of them being what is probably Greg Lake's best straightforward ballad, \\"From the Beginning.\\"  It also has the band's best un-straightforward ballad suite, the mind-boggling \\"Trilogy,\\" which starts out as a lament for a love that he has to leave and turns into the sort of full-tilt psychedelic rocker which the band is famed for.  \\"Endless Enigma,\\" which starts the album, is the kind of piece that put the band on the map before _Trilogy_, starting the album off on solid, spooky, instrumentally-stunning ground.  \\"The Sheriff\\" is one of the band's quintessential Wild West songs, none of which ever let the listener down, on this album or any other.  Also in an Americana vein like this, the other famous song here is their rousing rendition of Aaron Copland's \\"Hoedown,\\" a song which they routinely open their live set with, one that generates considerable excitement, indeed (The time I got to see them live, my girlfriend and I walked in late, right as they ripped into this song.  I though I would bust out of my skin if I didn't see them play it, which I didn't.  Well, I didn't bust out of my skin, they put on an excellent set, and the anticipation created by my missing this song actually marks the occasion.)<br /><br />So we have five unconditionally excellent compositions here which comprise far more than half the disc.  Underneath the level of these songs are two songs that one could characterize as \\"just fine,\\" unfortunately left for the end of the disc.  \\"Living Sin\\" is a somewhat turgid continuation of the fuzzed-out stompers they did on their debut (like \\"The Barbarian\\") and to which they didn't return a lot after this disc.  It seems there's only so far a band can go with the classically-influenced troglodytic rock number.  Equally so-so is the disc's closer, \\"Abaddon's Bolero,\\" which seems to attempt for an ambient feel in the style of the contemporaneous Mike Oldfield, but merely ends up as a vehicle for Emerson's often aimless keyboard meanderings (a fault which slightly mars the end of the otherwise sublime \\"From the Beginning\\").<br /><br />If you truly love ELP, then there is no excuse not to own and study this album in great depth.  If you only know them for \\"Lucky Man\\" and the excerpt from \\"Karn Evil 9\\" they play on the radio and want to keep your acquaintance with them relatively superficial, just buy _Brain Salad Surgery_.  If that seminal disc grows on you, it surely won't be long that you meander the way of _Trilogy_ any way.  But for a first in-depth listen to the band, I don't believe that this one is the one to inspire the absolute mania from a fan that ELP warrants.odytic rock number.

B00001U0DP|5.0|To me, this movie is one of the most perfectly made movies I have ever seen. The timing and cinematography is excellent. I prefer the version I bought with subtitles as I have seen a dubbed version and something DOES get lost in translation. The italian language is beautiful and only adds to the quality of the movie.
B0000033OZ|5.0|I listened to this when I got up this morning and, like always, I walked away with highlights fresh in my mind.  The highlights are different every time I listen to it.  Today it was \\"Take a Pebble\\"; the first time I listened to this as an adolescent boy it was my least favorite song on the record because it is the mellowest.  The more you listen to it, though, the more it is engrained in your psyche.  I love it when it goes from the neo-classical verse to the folky acoustic guitar stomp-along complete with yells and whistles in the middle and then back out again into cascading arpeggios on the piano.  This is sensitive, cosmic stuff: \\"Just take a pebble/ and cast it in the sea./ Then watch the ripples/ that unfold into me,\\" serves like a mantra throughout the song taking you into a very meditative space that interanimates wonderfully with the many moods of the music.  A tour de force to start the career of one of the best bands in the history of rock.<br /><br />On other days, I take away other highlights.  The album starts out in maximum \\"bombast\\" mode with the fuzzed-out Bartok of \\"The Barbarian.\\"  About as hairy as rock got back then.  Other days will see me most excited when I play \\"Knife-Edge,\\" another adaptation of a classical modernist, this time Janacek's \\"Sinfonieta.\\"  Things get  wildest at the meeting place between classical and rock on \\"Three Fates,\\" going from pipe organ to drum solo to ensemble rockin'.  About the only thing that doesn't get me to spazz out with electric joy is \\"Lucky Man,\\" which I've heard too many times on the radio to find much in any more, especially in comparison to the rest of the eclectic and electric set on what certainly must be considered one of the best debuts ever.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I'm probably less familiar with the Phantom of the Opera than most people here, but I have to contend that this version just isn't that great. Sure the set decorations and cousums are great, and Emmy Rossum is a surprise charmer as Christine, but the film comes apart with the male leads of The Phantom and Raoul, with musical numbers that are too long, and with a story that really was never that great.  <br /> <br />What I do know about The Phantom of the Opera is the classic silent 1925 version, with such an actual scary Phantom, and that has much more of an effect on me as a long time movie fan than this kind of cheesy insanity that the Phantom of this film. Here Gerald Butler as the Phantom is miniacle, jealous, and lusts after Christine, and will do anything to keep the opera house running as he thinks it should. He's more an annoyance than anything scary and conveniently he can pop out of anywhere at at time the story wants him, and hold people in their tracks as they try to put together what they were doing the last time they saw him. Patrick Wilson is a paticular weak point as Raoul, the human who loves Christine in the film's love triangle. He's really kind of a bore, and we have two really mediocre men fighting over this great girl, and the love chemistry is really limited at both fronts as she falls back and fourth from one to the other.  <br /> <br />I understand many people like this film much more than I do. The idea that a stranger with a mask could wisk a great girl from and opera house, to his dungon that no one knows about, without her putting up the least resistance, is to me flawed from the begining. It's not really that interesting or compelling of a love story, and in my opinion the musical numbers are pretty forgetable, while the dialog in the tone of song is unnecessary for a movie musical. I really wish that, like the recent great broadway to movie musical Chicago, this film could have made itself a standout among it own, instead of somethingpretty, at times decent, but at others sluggish. The ending of this film, on the plus side, is quite well done, and makes up somewhat for some of the earlier flaws.
B0000033P0|5.0|From the vocal opening that sounds like monks chanting in discord, all the way throughout the various and frenzied Tarkus suite, to the weird letdown of \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" at the end of the LP, this album never fails to shock and awe with its startling range of contours and textures.  The highlight is clearly the first side: the \\"Tarkus\\" suite is a quintessential prog opus at the level of VDGG's \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers,\\" \\"Yes's \\"Close to the Edge,\\" and King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid Man.\\"  I've probably listened to this suite more than one hundred times in the twenty years since I heard it first and it never begins to wear off on me.  To get an idea of the infinite possibilities this suite offers in performance, catch the vamped-up performance on their live triple LP _Welcome Back My Friends . . ._ (pray that this comes out on CD soon!!!).<br /><br />Critics still malign ELP as the worst of an excessive genre.  In actuality, it is the best of bringing all the most radical tendencies of sixties music across the spectrum into a rock power-trio setting.  You have the frantic syncopation of the best jazz artists, the experimentation with sound that characterized the most adventurous of the classical composers, and of course the sheer volume of the best of rock.  Jimi Hendrix wanted to jump on board ELP's craft around this time.  I trust his opinion far more than any so-called rock purist!<br /><br />The \\"Tarkus\\" suite tends to overshadow the rest of the album, but  there are certainly other gems here besides.  The next song, \\"Jeremy Bender\\" never fails to bring a smile, much like their other classic Wild West songs such as \\"The Sheriff\\" and \\"Benny the Bouncer.\\"  This contains classic prog-rock lyrical toss-offs: \\"Jeremy Bender was a man of leisure,/ Biggest pleasure in the evening sun./  Laid him down in a bed of roses,/ Finally decided to become a nun.\\"  The way that the lyrical passages go from silliness to honky-tonk piano and hand-clapping always just brings joy into my life.  One could make a study of ELP's cowboy songs alone.<br /><br />\\"Bitches' Crystal\\" is a quick study in tearing the listener's head off that tends to get buried in the ELP catalog.  I saw them play it live when they opened for Tull about ten years ago.  It was their first time playing it live in two decades, but they definitely rocked the crowd with it.  It distills all the manic energy and noise of the \\"Tarkus\\" suite into a few minutes.<br /><br />Tracks 4-6 have the perhaps dubious distinction of being the most memorable paean to atheism in the history of rock.  I remember being 13 years old, listening to this, and thinking how nonsensical my religious upbringing was: \\"Can you believe/ God makes you breathe?/ How did he lose/ six million Jews?\\"  Add the fact that this suite ends up rocking hard and a teenage listener is ready to convert to the religion of rock with proselytizing fervor for good on the first listen.  How much more potent does it get?<br /><br />ELP then simply f**k around to end the record.  They do a lame imitation of Jerry Lee Lewis on \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\"  It leaves you scratching your head, because after an unparalleled rock experience up until that point, you know that they know that they are being lazy and derivative.  Maybe it's to show us how far rock had evolved in the fifteen years since \\"Great Balls of Fire.\\"  If that's the case, one can only wish that rock would have evolved as much in the thirty years since _Tarkus_, which it certainly hasn't.ys just brings joy into my life.

How much more potent does it get? <br /> <br />ELP then simply f**k around to end the record.  They do a lame imitation of Jerry Lee Lewis on \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\"  It leaves you scratching your head, because after an unparalleled rock experience up until that point, you know that they know that they are being lazy and derivative.  Maybe it's to show us how far rock had evolved in the fifteen years since \\"Great Balls of Fire.\\"  If that's the case, one can only wish that rock would have evolved as much in the thirty years since _Tarkus_, which it certainly hasn't.
B000002HH9|5.0|Wild Mood Swings is probably my favorite Cure album. I love Want, Jupiter Crash, Mint Car, Strange Attraction and Round and Round. The people who trash this album are probably just stuck on the &#34;dark side&#34; of The Cure and think that they should only make albums like Pornography or Disintegration. I bought this album in 1997 and I still think it's incredible today.
B0000033TE|5.0|This was my second album I bought by ELP.  First was _Tarkus_, I heard it on midnight radio records when I was 13.  It seemed a light year away from the Duran Duran that my friends listened to at the time.  Then I got this one, separating me even more irrevocably from my friends' listening tastes.  My mom wondered whether she and my dad should make me listen to \\"normal\\" music.  It wouldn't have done any good.  Get hooked on this, classic Floyd, classic Yes, classic Rush, classic Tull, etc. and you will be spoiled on pop for good.<br /><br />And what could be better?  Pop was 95% rotten then and it is 99.9% rotten now.  Out with it!  \\"Man of steel, pray and kneel, with fever's blazing torch, thrust into the face of the night.\\"  Won't hear that in the same old baby baby I love you number one smash hit!  \\"Karn Evil 9\\" will always remain a thing of wonder.  ELP constitutes my younger classical music education.  They introduced me to Bartok and Janacek on their debut, Mussourgsky on _Pictures_, Ginastera and even the style of Stockhausen on this one.  The Stockhausen inspiration comes at the end of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" with the synths arpeggiating out of control.  I don't care what any self-righteous music critic says, the more that rock music brings into its folds the better and this album is absolute proof.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I was drawn to this album after i heard the song 'Helena'. I hadn't heard of MCR or anything, but i just took an interest because my name is Helena, and i found the song and thought it was cool that they wrote a song with my name on it! So i bought the album, fell in love with a couple more tracks ('I'm not ok' and 'To the end') and listened to those three songs obsessively for a while. Then i forgot about the album for a long time, and came back to it a few weeks ago. Now i can't put it down! Each song grabs your attention with it's own special technique that just sucks you in. I particulary love 'Thank you for the venom'(killer guitar riff! A lot heavier than the other songs) and 'you know what they do to guys like us in prison' (grabs your attention the moment the song starts, plus the giggle at the end is so cute!) This album has an amazing energy that i have only ever found in the very heavy artists such as Slipknot etc. and is so very rare in this style of music. Not that MCR can really be put into a catagory as there is no other band like them. YOU HAVE TO BUT THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!
B000068UXF|5.0|I have both a laser disk version of this release and the audio CD<br /><br />Sir Georg made witrh Placido Domingo singing the role of the Emperor.  In my view the cast is better in the video version, the<br /><br />orchestral playing about the same, but enjoyment is greatly enhanced by the video component.  Generally, the cost favors the video version.  The only negative for the video version is that one cannot follow the German and English versions of the libretto side by side.  One the screen it's either one or the other.  Solti considers this to be Strauss's masterpeice.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Finally, after ten years (skipping past 'A Day Without Rain' and 'Memory of Trees'), another beautifully crafted recording from Irish chantreuss Enya.<br />There's not a bad track on this CD and well worth the wait,<br />certainly better IMO then her previous-'A Day Without Rain', which had a samey-sound to most of the tracks due to overusage of synth-electronic plucking strings, and better than 'Memory of Trees' five years prior to that. Both of these recordings had several good tracks on them, however Amarantine is near perfect in it's song selection. This recording completes the trilogy of her finest works- 'Watermark', 'Shepherd Moons' and now 'Amarantine'.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Midnight Rambler:  Play it loud, late at night, turn out the lights.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This film was an exceptional experience. It gave us a view into a deeply emotionaly love that was difficult for it participants to express or at points to even recognize and yet it held them together for nearly 2o years. Ang Lee showed us how love could be a \\"Force of Nature\\" almost having a life of it's own. I was deeply moved and will long be haunted by the characters in this film whom have become dear to me.
0783231202|5.0|Needed & necessary.  God bless Spielberg for rescuing a footnote moment of our history, unknown or forgotten by most of us, and for illuminating the present with a piece of our past.  The weaknesses of Amistad (Morgan Freeman, in every Freeman film I've seen, is forever playing a cameo of Morgan Freeman) hardly detract or distract from the Middle Passage.  The Horse Latitudes scene in which the slavers' load is lightened is astonishing and almost beyond imagining.  The magic of Amistad is that Spielberg lets us imagine and almost experience that moment.
B000641ZA4|4.0|Iinitially I was excited about adding Genesis' music videos to my DVD collection.  However, most of the videos are simply footage of the band playing each song.  I was expecting more videos along the lines of \\"Land of Confusion\\" and \\"I Can't Dance.\\"  Still, the quality of the sound and video made it worth the price.
0553588486|3.0|From the reviews I read, I expected more. At the end of 800+ pages, I found myself not particularly caring about most of the characters. But I did care that the end of the book didn't bring much of an end to the storylines. It's fine for a book to be the first in a series, but it should also be somewhat self-contained; I didn't feel this one was. And since I don't really care what happens next, I won't be moving on to the second.
B000BB1MHS|4.0|From the opening scenes of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" I expected to see Michael Keaton in the batsuit pop out at any moment. For, make no mistake, Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic novel, is very \\"Burton-esque.\\" The crazy visuals and wacky characters abound. Depp's performance is kinda rediculous, though there are moments where he's funny. The kids, however, are very good. They are the star of the film, in my opinion. Freddie Highmore gives the best performance of the film as Charlie, and his portrayal of the character is the only thing that is better than \\"Willie Wonka,\\" as he doesn't whine and complain like Peter Ostrum.<br /><br />The funniest scene in the movie is the TV-Room. If you, like me, are a fan of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" then you'll be dying lauging at this part.<br /><br />Despite Burton's freaky visual style and Depp's ludicrous performance, kids and parents will find much to appreciate in this film. But I still recommend \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" over this one.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I watch this film and everytime I feel like I'm watching art moving across the screen.  The direction here is brilliant and breathtaking...brutal and stunning and just infectious all at the same time.  The film, an adaptation of Hubert Selbeys novel of the same name, Requiem for a Dream follows the lives of four people, interlocked by blood, friendship and addiction.  Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn in an oscar caliber performance) has resorted to couch-potato status as she wastes her life away in front of the television with massive amounts of diet pills and coffee to make it through the day, her favorite gameshow always on to take her mind off her addiction.  Her son, lowlife Harry (Leto) has resorted to pawning his mothers things just to support his heroin habit, a habit he shares with best friend Tyrone (Waynes in a performance I never knew he had in him) and girlfriend Marion (Connelly).  The film helps to show the massive effect that addiction has on a person, one of the best scenes involving Sara imagining a carniverous fridge, and it also shows the self deterioration a person undergoes when giving themselves over to feeding their addiction.  With their whole world spinning out of control the four addicts, the four losers as it were, fall to pieces and theres nothing there to put them together.  One of the most heartbreaking scenes involves Marion giving herself away sort-of-speak in order to feed her habit.  You can feel her inner morality sink and her pride get pushed aside all for a high she can't find anywhere else.  Aronofsky is a brilliant director with an eye for imagery and a passion for the brutality it takes to tell a story of this magnitude.  Major props to everyone involved, especially the director and cast for creating a brilliant adaptation of one of the best novels around.
1402532903|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is the story of Susie Salmon, who (we are told in the first line) was murdered at age 14. The book details her adjustment to her own death, the rapidly-cooling investigation into her murder and the detached existence of her killer. But more importantly, Susie speaks from \\"my heaven\\" of the effect that her death had on her family--the unquenchable sadness, the guilt and horror--and the effect it had on her friends. Siebold plumbs every nook of the human heart to show how the darkness of murder seeps into every corner, robbing victims and families of their peace and even their sanity.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is also a book about how the dead remain with us--watching us, desiring us, wishing to continue a life that is beyond their grasp.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is almost perfect. I do trifle with its vision of a Godless heaven - a pleasant enough place that is much like Earth. And we are teased along fruitlessly throughout the book by the promise of bringing complete closure to the murder. But the \\"lovely bones\\" of the title are less about ulnas and mandibles and more about another kind of structure. But you'll have to read the book to learn what that is.<br /><br />The audio CD version is excellent. Narrator Alyssa Bresnahan does a fine job of giving Susie just the right blend of heavenly omniscience and juvenile longing.
0780020685|5.0|It's been a long time since I seen this movie for the first time.  Since that time I have seen it at least twenty times, each and every time it feels as good as the first time.  It is a truly a great movie made by one of the greatest directors of all time, Akira Kurosawa.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is spectacular.  Each and every scene leaves you amazed at its beauty.  Even the cutscenes will leave you breathless, and all this is in black and white with a little grain!  To tell the truth, it couldn't have been done better.<br /><br />The music is a very fun part of the movie.  There are many themes that run through the movie for each character.  It helps to blend the whole movie together.<br /><br />And what can I say about the acting.  First of all it starred two of the most famous Japanese actors of the time.  Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura. I can't say any more about them that hasn't been said already somewhere else.  At any rate, I recommend them in all their movies, especially Toshiro Mifune.  He has so much energy it comes through the screen to you.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that keeps giving, with its beautiful imagery and moving story, all the way down to the action.  It gives in everything top notch.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anybody.
B00005UKE0|5.0|All Things Must Pass is the best post-Beatles album. There are several high points, such as \\"What is Life,\\" \\"Apple Scruffs,\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord.\\" The sound is bright, bold, and gorgeous from beginning to end. To me the high point of this collection is the vastly underrated love song, \\"If Not For You.\\" To me it's as moving as \\"Something,\\" his #1 smash he released with the Beatles in 1969, and might be the most overlooked love song in rock and roll history. The only post Beatles album that comes close to this in quality is the latest from Paul McCartney (Chaos and Creation in the Backyeard). Paul and John's solo careers might have been more successful than George's, but All Things Must Pass was the high point of any of the post-Beatles solo releases.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The series continues to improve and I think that the best is yet to come.
B000088E6D|5.0|This CD is excellent!  If you like jazz and even some modern songs made over, then you will like this CD.  \\"Crazy little thing called love\\" is a great version of the Freddie Mercury song.  Great music to sing to and dance to.  You will adore it.
0316168815|1.0|I am amazed that this book got excellent reviews. The plot is inane and disturbing, the characters are totally unrealistic (e.g., the randy, drunken Grandmother Lynn; the totally forgiving husband), and the writing is so laughably bad that the entire book should win a special award in the Bulwer-Lytton contest! Here are a few of my \\"favorite\\" passages (I'm NOT making these up): <br />1) Page 223- \\"She asked for coffee and toast in a restaurant and buttered it with tears\\".  <br />2) Page 225- \\"Despite how he could dissect it- the vessels of the globe of my eye, the surgical anatomy of my nasal fossae, the light tincture of my epidermis- he could not avoid them, the lips he had once kissed.\\" <br />3) Page 253- \\"The penguins tottered and clucked and dived, slipping off the habitat rocks like amiable hams but living under water like tuxedoed muscles.\\" <br /> <br />Unfortunately, these are only three passages and the entire book is littered with this type of florid prose. I've read reviews remarking on this book's painful theme, but the most painful thing about this book is the book itself! <br /> <br />If you want to read a good book about coming of age and loss, skip this unmitigated disaster and try Barbara Kingsolver's \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\". It's definitely worth the effort.
B000002GFT|5.0|For this one,  Fairport did traditional folk pieces using both modern and traditional instruments. Regardless of what instruments they were using, they had the beauty of Sandy Denny's voice to carry the day along with Richard Thompson's guitarwork. Denny dominates this disc and why not- she's very good here. After this record, fairport would start their endless game of musical chairs with the personnel of the band but this is the most popular version of the band at their best. All songs here are very good with the epic TammLinn the standout. It's a shame they couldn't milk this formula further- it worked great for them.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Even a couple years after first buying it, this is one of my favourite scores, and certainly one of the most fun times I've had listening to action music.  After The Time Machine, another personal favourite of mine, I eagerly anticipated Badelt's next album.  This one actually exceeded my expectations. <br />Firstly, lets address some harsh critiques of this score.  Many have called it over-indulgent and over-produced and too much like a loud Zimmer score.  Well, yeah, it is.  That's part of the fun.  It's rambunctous, exuberant, joyously and unabashedly alive and action packed.  It's not ashamed to go full throttle with the heroism in almost every track.  That this becomes too much for some people is part of the gamble - Raiders of the Lost Ark was deemed to silly for some critics back upon first release, and now look where it's at.  The other critisicm is that the album is too short, at only 45 minutes.  While I agree it would've been cool to have more music, I can't say that at the end of listening, I feel short-changed.  This might be a case where a little goes a long way.   <br />The score switches from explosive action to all-out heroism to some quieter romantic music for the listener to catch a breath - but the first two styles are certainly in more abundance than the last.  The heroic theme is hummable and as catchy as the Raiders theme, and the action music is definately in prime Zimmer style. <br />This is a score every collecter and even casual listener should have in his collection.  It's not serious, dramatic music like Requiem for a Dream.  That wasn't it's intention, so one shouldn't view it as such.  It's supposed to be a rollicking good time, and at that, it succeeds admirably.   <br />cheers <br />KZ
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'm not a huge Madonna fan, or even really a huge fan of dance music for that matter.  However, I was hooked on this cd right away.  It's lots of fun to dance around your house (or in public), and the songs are actually all unique unlike some dance cds where every track sounds the same.  Her \\"Music\\" cd only had about 2 or 3 tracks that I really enjoyed.  I enjoy every single song on this cd and don't skip over any of them.  Highly recommended to people that enjoy fun music without needing a lot of depth to their lyrics all of the time!
B0009IW88A|4.0|Batman Begins is one of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's best work.  I absolutely love the score.  Unfortunately, the people who recorded it and released it on CD deserve a thwack on the head.  For some reason, they thought that people who buy a Zimmer score to an action movie only want to hear about, oh, 9 minutes of action music.  Huh???  Zimmer wrote some incredible action music to the film, some of his very best.  And all we get of it on this CD release are 3 minutes in the third track, 2 in the 5th, 2 in the 8th, and the big 4 minutes on track 10.  This is about 50 minute album.  That leaves around 40 minutes of other music that isn't action packed.  So what's left? <br />Well, we got a beautiful romance theme obviously headed by Howard.  That is used in two tracks.  Then we got the main Batman theme, a thunderous motif that sounds like giant wings flapping, and it's very effective.  That leaves a couple other pieces of music that are good, and then, inexplicably, about 6-8 minutes of absolute nothing.  I'm talking, nothing.  Not even quiet background music - I mean, there's spaces on this album where absolutely nothing is happening musically.  Couple that with sequences that are just sound effects, like the Scarecrow's sound effects, and you have a lot of wasted space on this CD that should've been used for more action music.  Among other great action selections, where is the final confrontation music?  The biggest action scene of the film, the climax on the train, had some of the best action music I've ever heard and was completely left off this album.  WHY?????? <br />I should focus this review more on what's here instead of what's not, but it irritates me because the music in the film is so great.  Still, what's on the album is on the album, and no amount of complaining can change that.  It's still worth your money, and has some parts of extreme power, emotion, and, yes, action.  So go out and buy it, and enjoy it as I have many times....just don't beexpecting a complete release. <br />cheers <br />KZ
0778321606|1.0|If a poorly written soap opera theme is to your liking, this may be a book to read...In my opinion it is just plain awful,immature,fairy tale..nothing rings true...except one's desire for a child..How on earth did a publisher ever accept it..
B000002LIM|5.0|What more is there to say about Danny Elfman's Batman score?  It's one of the most popular and well-known scores of all time.  Thousands of people have written their opinions of it.  What more can I say?  I can say how it affected me personally.  It was the first movie score I ever bought, and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said \\"listen to this music in the opening credits Riley\\".  Since then, my score collection has expanded 400 times, and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it.   <br />What can I say, really?  I can't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes.  I can say that this music is incredible and still in my top 5 of all time.  It's Elfman's best work.  It's heroic, it's dark, it's thematic (I dare you not to whistle the Batman theme when this CD is over), it's operatic, it's over-the-top, it's action packed, it's brilliant from start to finish.  There isn't any wasted space on this album.  Elfman has a job to do, and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success.  He practically created this idea of a \\"dark superhero theme\\", and while the movie was a slight dissappointment, this CD continues to thrill people of any generation. <br />What can I say?  This score is a masterpiece.  End of discussion. <br />cheers <br />KZ
B000AMUU94|1.0|If I had known going in that there were so many single edit versions on this set I would have just downloaded from iPod.<br /><br />Don't buy this if you want the real Bowie songs.<br /><br />Only for fans of cheesey edits.
B000002AT6|5.0|So James Horner repeats himself.  Get over it.  The more I hear this complaint, the more I get sick of it.  Does Legends of the Fall sound similar to other Horner works?  Yeah, sometimes.  Does that matter?  Hell no.  This is one of the most moving and powerful works of music that I've ever heard.  It's a tremendous achievement and one of my favourite Horner soundtracks. <br />The music ranges from quietly beautiful, usually accompanied with an achingly moving piano, to the melodramatic-and-proud-of-it string movements to some exciting and incredibly powerful music such as in Samuel's Death.  The thing is, this CD offers so much musically.  It doesn't linger on one set theme and repeat it forever, like a Clint Eastwood score, for instance.  Horner here gives us a wealth of beautiful and heart breaking material that sounds better every time you listen to it.  Just try to listen to the last track and not feel moved.  Just try to listen to the aforementioned Samuel's Death track and not feel chills run up your spine. <br />This is a great score from a great composer.  If it sounds in parts like Titanic or Braveheart or what have you, so be it.  The point is that it works wonderfully in the film, and even better as a stand alone album, and that's the main goal all composers strive for. <br />cheers <br />KZ <br />

B0000DZEA1|4.0|Music is a collection of notes and rhythms that present an emotion or the lack there of one. The Lord of The Rings, Return of the King CD is no exception and is an excellent source of Music. The cd presents you the listener with a series of emotions like determination, peace, energy, and happiness.  <br />    The cd of this movie helps illustrate the Emotions that run continuously through out the movie. For those that have not seen the movies they are good and this music is only a taste of the excitement one could get from listening to the cd of this excellent movie. <br />    This is the cd of a multi Award winning movie. The movie it is based off of actually received 11 Oscars one of them being Best music, original song Into the West. With being able to buy individual songs on line I stopped buying cds a while back because I usually only found one or two songs I enjoyed listening to. However this was one of the last cds I bought and one of the very few that I enjoy listening to the entire cd. So I highly recommend you to buy this cd. <br />
B00004LN16|4.0|To make it short and sweet this is a great effort from AC/DC.  This album brought the fire back inside the true fans of the band. If you can spare a few extra bucks get the import the bonus disc is killer.

B0001MDP3G|1.0|This movie is, without question, the absolute worst movie ever made. This movie is, essentially a remake of \\"Gone With The Wind\\", which, when considering the amount of killing, is extremely boring. Cold mountain is equally boring, no one I have met was able to stay awake through the whole thing. After viewing this movie, I am sure you will wish it was gone with the wind. However this, unfortunately will never happen, considering, as I have heard from unreliable sources, that both the house and Senate have passed an amendment illegalising the destruction of this movie. I have also heard that it is the favorite movie of both Hillery Clinton and John Kerry. The box claims that it is in English, but most of the characters seem to be speaking an obscure dialect of ancient Sino-Tibetan Xiang Chinese. I am told that this is only due to their \\"southern accents\\", but I am very skeptical of that. The characters also cry too much, and win academy awards for their poor acting in doing so. This movie does invoke a strong emotional reaction from the audience, but I am not entirely sure that it is the one intended.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This dvd is pure magic. The band played marvelously (as always) and the crowd energy is roaring. Freddie did an amazing show, yet he obviously had a hard time to deliver it because of the terrible AIDS virus inside him. An excellent list of songs is played. The extras are just as good, with peeks of behind the scenes of the tour and interviews with Roger and Brian. A must-have for all Queen collections!
0783226845|5.0|\\"Scent of a Woman\\" is inspiring and real. With so many movies that lack any type of depth, this is an example of the opposite. The message isn't flawed, because integrity and courage are underrated and this film celebrates them. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
0156528207|5.0|There are few books that should be read by all.  Antoine de Saint-Exup?ry's The Little Prince is one of them.  It is a sweet and endearing, yet deceptively relevant story of the bond formed between a pilot marooned in the Sahara Desert and a young boy from another planet on a journey through the cosmos.  While most often classified as children's fiction- and it is certainly accessible to younger readers- The Little Prince  may serve better as a long-form fable for those of us who have become mired within the 'grown-up' world.  Saint-Exup?ry shows remarkable insight into human character, beauty and the nature of attachment while making strong moral statements upon the nature of the adult world.  Yet, the story remains generally light-hearted and playful.  The Little Prince is a classic that will delight and inspire readers of all ages and deserves a prominent place upon the shelf among history's great works of literature.    Cautionary note:  While the new Richard Howard translation (Blue Cover) may be more technically sound, it fails to capture the poetry and playful nature of the original Katherine Woods translation  (White Cover).
B00062IVKS|5.0|How this movie lost to \\"Ordinary People\\" at the Oscars is beyond me.  Comparatively speaking, \\"Ordinary People\\" sucked.  And Bobby Deniro should have won the award for \\"Best Actor\\"...not to mention most of the supporting cast winning awards also.<br /><br />Nonetheless, being heralded as the best movie of the 80's is a well-deserved accolade.  Movie aficianodos who don't have this film in their library....need to find a new hobby.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|The sceneries were beautiful, breathtaking, but the romance was a marathon. One day they didn't like each other well, the next they were in love without all the shenaningas. But the fact that the hero and heroin were so young, in their teens, made this love in a hurry seems believable. It is a good version but the masterpiece in my opinion is still the BBC one with Colin Firth. In that old version Darcy and Lizzie had their slow cooking romance and their chemistry was so palpable that really made me believe them to be in love for real off-screen, the way Collin Firth's eyes shone whenever he was looking at Lizzie, it was so real (especially when she was helping Georgiana at the piano) and the sweet face of Lizzie when staring him back. That scene is unforgettable. Oh my, if I could exchange places with Lizzie, be her... <br />The actors in this version made the most in 2 hours and the wonderful settings made this movie a 2nd best, in my opinion. I love it, though I still prefer the emotional and romantic details of the BBC version.    <br />In this version they kept only the basics, even mr. Wickham and Miss Bingley didn't have enough time to show all their conniving dark sides in total splendor. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Shot in the foot by a studio who just didn't get it.  This series was aired out of order and on friday nights when thier target audience was all out \\"socializing\\".  It's no wonder that the ratings were bad.  It's also no wonder that those few people who saw this show fell in love with it.  If you like well written plots with irony, snappy comebacks, well developed characters, actors and actresess worth drooling over and caring about, buy this series.   <br />    Mankind has expanded to the stars (actually just one star with about 200 planets and moons) and have brought all of their humanity with them.  The inner worlds are ordered, technologically advanced and DULL.  Big Brother watches averybody just enough that most people feel safe and not controlled.  The worlds farther out have to acknowledge \\"Allaiance directives\\" but have a litle more independence.  This is usually in direct relation to how developed they are themselves.   <br />    Malcom Reynolds fought for the loosing side in a war of independace from the \\"Alliance\\".  He now captains a small transport ship \\"firefly class\\" and stays on the fringes of the territory where the alliance aint.  Smuggler, Thief, Legitimate buisnessman, he wears any hat that gets money in his pocket and keeps \\"Serenity\\" flying. <br />    This series is wonderful.  I highly reccomend buying it for gifts to friends.  It's not too expensive and almost no one saw it.  Everyone I have shown it to have all said the same thing, \\"Why did they cancell this show?\\"  This was the best sci/fi show to come along in decades.  One of the best things about giving this as a gift is that you can follow it up later with gift #2...The movie \\"SERENITY\\".  This movie is just as good as the series and answers most of the questions left dangleing when the series was cancelled.
0767812387|4.0|This is a nice movie.  Not an Oscar winner, but very pleasant and no sex (a virtue/shortcoming depending on your point of view).  I purchased the movie for the salsa dancing, but all of the dancing and music in the movie are great.  From the opening scenes staged in Cuba to the last dance scene the the movie is big time fun.  It also is beautifully filmed.  Chaynne and Vanessa are both easy on the eyes so each gender will enjoy it.  The movie is defintely worth a viewing.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This never happens in hollywood.  Major motion pictures do not get made out of cancelled tv shows.  They especially don't make millions in profits.  Unless the fans wont let the show go away.  Unless the cast and crew don't universally know they are working on something special; Something with more potential than anything they have worked on before or since. <br />     Buy Firefly the complete series then buy this movie!  You wont be dissapointed.  This entire series is just plain FUN.  The writng is fun.  The action is tense but realistic.  Even the setting is more believable if you think about it.   The actors/actressess are all gorgeous and sexy.   <br /> <br />    A top notch scifi series that is so popular with everyone who's seen it that it stands an extremely good chance of being picked up in the near future for another run.  Bonus:  When was the last time you heard someone use the word \\"palaver\\" in a scince fiction movie?
0385338082|5.0|I had to read this book two times, it was so funny!  I enjoy Sophie Kinsella's work so that wasn't surprising but the way this story came together was just HILARIOUS!
B000002UZ1|5.0|Wow this 2 cd set is just packed with classic songs. 36 years since the beatles first enterd a recording studio and the world still can't get enough of them! This package covers the final three years of the bands recording carrer, before they all went solo. Yes, all these classics were made in just 3 years.  <br /> <br />This album is great, but one must also get the red album (1962-1966) to enjoy the beatles in full glory. Unless you are just looking for the odd track, get both. If you are on a budget and can't afford both, don't settle for just one, you'd be better off getting the Number Ones CD if that has the song(s) you want.  <br /> <br />The Beatles were the most successful band of the 20th century, and with hit's like \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"Let It Be\\", \\"Get Back\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Something\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields\\" it's no wonder why!
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great movie. The kids enjoyed it so much at my brothers I had to buy it for them at home. Recommended for the kids.
0385338082|5.0|I bought this book for light reading on the plane, and I'm sure the other passengers thought I was a nut because I couldn't help but laugh out loud!  This isn't classic literature, but it's fun, has a clever plot with some interesting twists, all making it the perfect guilty pleasure.  I found Can You Keep a Secret better than Shopaholic.  It's so good that I passed it around to several friends--all of who enjoyed it, too.
B000BP86OG|5.0|In the modern age where stupidity, \\"thug life\\", and playing the same song over and over again just with a different title seem to be the norm, we are given The Darkness.  They are perhaps the greatest musical enema since Nirvana in the early nineties.  To be brutally honest modern music sucks by definition.  And to those who will critique this review and probably draw the conclusion that I am some old \\"dude\\" who has been to one too many Grateful Dead concerts, then you would be wrong.  I am a testosterone filled 16-year-old male who has been forced to listen to more Eminem \\"records\\" than what can be considered humane.  I'll give it to you straight, this album rocks.  No seriously, it RRRRRRAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!!.  Every song kicks some major ass.  It is perhaps one of the finest albums released this decade.  As an album it flows perfectly and seems neither too long nor too short, but just right.  The actual idea of musical light and shade is very much present here, much to even my own shock.  It is incredible that one band can play something like \\"Is it Just Me\\", \\"One Way Ticket\\", and \\"Blind Man\\", all on the same album.  It shows a level of musical maturity that has almost disappeared all together.  Are they Led Zeppelin?  No, but the same energy is there.  The same desire to grab you by the throat and give you a kick ass rock experience is still there.  No filler tracks ladies and gents, not one.  And with a new bassist and Justin's cocaine addiction I was definitely concerned that this would be a terrible follow up, but no that stuff just makes for better lyrics. Speaking of lyrics, I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard listening to a rock record.  The jokes are there people, and yes, its okay to laugh.  I know that I make these guys out to be demi-gods, which of course they're not.  But in a world where if you asked the question \\"Who is the best rock band ever\\" and people say Green Day, we need The Darkness very, very badly.  If you've heard any of the following bands and liked them: AC/DC, Aerosmith, Queen, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin... then please at least give this album a chance.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|This film was stupid. What a let down. Looked very good in the trailers. Saw sucked!!!!!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This CD just has a great sound throughout.  They have taken their music to another level.  It's as deep as Room on Fire.  To me, \\"Is This It\\" had more fillers than any other release from the Strokes, despite its rave reviews.  \\"First Impressions of the Earth\\" is solid and well worth purchasing the entire CD. <br /> <br />Highlights include You Only Live Once, Juicebox, Heart in a Cage, Razorblade, Electricityscape, and Ize of the World.  Really most of the songs are good though.  Enjoy. <br />
B000BNI90O|5.0|The original release  of the soundtrack for the Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best soundtracks ever released.  However at just over 70 minutes in length, fans of the movie were missing about 2/3's of Howard Shore's Oscar winning score.  NOw Shore receives his due as the complete recording of the Fellowship of the Ring has now been released.  Not simply from the theatrical release but from the extended release featuring every bit of HOward Shore's music as well as the songs that helped make the movie so popular.  This set, all 3 cd's worth is the complete score to the movie.  There is no music left unheard after listening to this fantastic collection.  It was awesome and completely enjoyable for fans of Lord of the Rings, fans of movie scores, or fans of HOward Shore.  I'm hoping that The Two Towers gets the same treatment.  Excellent, superb and overwhelming in its' greatness.
B00005JNX0|4.0|I have a son who has reached the age where he is interested in certain things, like animals and animated movies and such. <br />He then enjoys watching them...over and over and over again...as I'm sure many more experienced parents are certainly aware of. <br />So, the big question is: can an adult watch this 30 times in the space of a month, and not go bonkers? <br /> <br />The succinct answer would be: yes. <br /> <br />No, it doesn't approach the zippy genius of Pixar's best efforts, but there's a lot to like, a lot to see, and a lot to appreciate. <br /> <br />The vocal cast is fine...and the angular design of the animals is necessary to distinguish this from the typical Disney figures.  <br />The backdrop of Manhattan is lushly depicted, as is the African jungle. Repetitive viewings will allow you to note artistic details that zip by the first dozen times. <br /> <br />While the plot is no great shakes, the dialogue is actually pretty good. It's fast enough that you'll find new lines every other viewing or so. It took me about twelve screenings to decode the zebra's exclamation \\"Sugar! Honey! Iced tea!\\" <br /> <br />The penguins are a deluded delight. as is the King Lemur. <br /> <br />The DVD is crisp and the sound impeccable.
B000BEZQ18|2.0|Good soundtrack CD for what will probably go down in history as one of the most overrated, overhyped movies of all time...
0679720200|5.0|Often those works of literature that are labelled as classics by the cultural and academic establishment are simply not accessible to the lay public. \\"The Outsider\\" (or \\"The Stranger\\") by Albert Camus is an exception. This is a very easy to read book and yet it is not so easy to read. Camus lays his themes bare in a simple plot about a very ordinary man. Yet beneath the surface of ordinariness lies an extraordinary story. I believe that its impact as a philosophical and moral tale owes much to the raw and unpretentious presentation of the author in this case. <br /> <br />I shan't reveal the plot yet I will say that other reviewers' appraisals of the protagonist Meursault are interesting to say the least. To claim that he is unlikeable or evil is short-sighted and ultimately untrue in my opinion. In fact I felt compassion for Meursault and could identify with some of his psychology, which was brilliantly portrayed by Camus. One of the things that struck me most profoundly about Meursault is his rather dry penchant for calling a spade a spade and telling life like he sees it. He agrees to help his neighbour Raymond, for example, because he sees no reason not to. He is a loner but fundamentally a decent person. He is an outsider to social conventions and in many respects I applaud him for being so. I for one do not consider him guilty of anything other than being true to himself. Ultimately this is one reason why this book is so thoroughly thought-provoking. It will keep you thinking about it long after you have put it down.
B00005JNTX|2.0|This was one movie I couldn't wait to have, so I pre-ordered.  Movie is perfectly acted, violent, and graphically beautiful.<br /><br />This DVD, however, comes with almost NO extras.  Spend the extra US$5 and get the \\"Uncut, super-duper, extended\\" version.
0307276902|1.0|What a disappointment and true waste of valuable reading time...
B000063DI8|4.0|My fifth Maiden album. When I first bought this item I was going to expect such a thing as Fear Of The Dark, which I would not appreciate. But I still wanted this album because of the cool cover and curiosity. I really was praised when hearing this album for the first time. Not bad at all, but when I heard Fear Of The Dark for the first time it was worse. This album really has a more Maiden sound, which the next album doesn't. You hear that Dickinson is still willing to sing normally. But he doesn't always. This is the first of the two albums where he destroyed his once so good voice.<br /><br />I believe this album is underrated because there are songs that are just as good as (for example) Heaven Can Wait, The Clairvoyant and The Trooper. The opening song Tailgunner is rated very good by most people. I disagree, it's a good opener, that's for sure, but definitely not one of the best songs of the album, which Holy Smoke is. The single released song is really a cool song, ignoring Dickinsons voice, cause that kind of singing really fits on this song. No Prayer For The Dying is a beautiful composed ballad which is emotional sung and it containes a good guitar solo. Public Enema Number One is comparable to Tailgunner, it's good but not great. The chorus is weak in my opinion. Fates Warning is really one of the best of the album, with good lyrics, music and vocals. The Assassin is a song which needs more filling, and the chorus reminds me to the Fear Of The Dark album, it's weak and doesn't fit in a Maiden album. But fortunately we have Run Silent Run Deep on the album which is the best of the album. To understand that, you need to hear it. Hooks In You is good too, but if Dickinson had sung it on Somewhere In Time or Powerslave it would have been a lot better. Bring Your Daughter... ...To The Slaughter is a nice song, but it's better on Live At Donington. I think it is the weakest song of the album. The can do better then that. It's totally not the Maiden style they were used to make. But I can enjoy the song anyway. And last but not least we have Mother Russia, the final song on the album. It's a very good song written because Russia was out of communism. It sounds like a Russian march or something like that.<br /><br />You see what I think about this album, it is good, but it also could have been better. Why did Smith leave the band? It was a shame, you know? Well this album is scamped too, I think they wanted to make an album as quickly as possible. It's still enjoyable.<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!!y were used to make. But I can enjoy the song anyway. And last but not least we have Mother Russia, the final song on the album. It's a very good song written because Russia was out of communism. It sounds like a Russian march or something like that.  <br /> <br />You see what I think about this album, it is good, but it also could have been better. Why did Smith leave the band?

0786915749|3.0|This book is definitely worth a read, as are some of Weis and Hickman's later books. The beginning is not very original, and will have you wondering where you've heard this before. It's a bit like Lord of the Rings at first, but once you get further into the book, you'll see it branch off into its own story. <br /> <br />It lags a bit at certain times in the book, but I was never bored with it. The characters all have very interesting personalities, with Raistlin, the mage, being my favorite. Most of the book is from Tanis's point of view, which is fine with me because he has a complex personality and background, and you'll enjoy reading about him. Plus, not seeing the story from everyone's point of view (most of the time) keeps the story focused, as you could get confused easily with all the different companions. Then, when you get a glimpse into another character's point of view, it's exciting to see a different perspective, and always leaves you questioning. <br /> <br />While I think there are a few weak points in the writing where I felt detached from the characters, for the most part, the reader plunges into the action right beside everyone else. I've enjoyed some of the authors' later books (The Darksword Trilogy, The Death Gate Chronicles), and it was interesting to see how they wrote years before those books came out. This is more of your typical heroes go on a quest against evil kind of book, but the classic storyline is a good one. Anyone who likes these authors or wants to read a classic fantasy should read this ;).
B0000CC5CS|5.0|I just found this at Walmart for $3.88 can not believe it !!!!!
B000001TVD|5.0|I remember being surprised when I first got this CD ten years ago. I was familiar with Funkadelic's later albums and this was the first of their early albums I ever purchased. The first thing that struck me was that this was not a slick studio recording; it was gritty, loud, and impossible to ignore. I don't think that Funkadelic's debt to Jimi Hendrix was ever as evident as on this album. \\"Super Stupid\\" not only has a guitar riff reminiscent of Hendrix but a vocal part also. Eddie Hazel was an amazing guitarist and one that I don't think gets enough credit for his playing on songs like \\"Maggot Brain\\". I doubt that there are many guitarists that can play a solo for ten minutes and keep it as lyrical, spiritual, and interesting as Hazel did on this track. His work throughout the album is electrifying. \\"Can You Get To That\\" is a catchy song with some great lyrics and is one of my favorites off this disc. \\"Wars Of Armageddon\\" has to be heard to be believed. This nine and a half minute track that closes the album is a mix of screams, babies crying, sirens, and other sound effects cranked out over a deep groove by the band. I remember being taken aback the first time I heard it, but it has become one of the standout tracks for me over the past few years of listening. Overall, this album captures Funkadelic in their early stages of development and should be considered essential listening for fans of the group. As a fan of funk music I found this album to be particularly interesting because of the blend of late 60's psychedelia, heavy guitar, and the quirkiness that would characterize Funkadelic's later albums all combined into one sound. Knowing how the band would evolve as time went on makes this CD that much more interesting to hear.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film is right on point.  No wonder it has won so many accolades and foreign and national film awards.  The film chronicles how Mr. Rove and company seized power in the United States in 2000 with their figurehead president: George Bush.  Mr. Bush, a failure at all he touches, not to mention his cowardice shown while hiding out in the National Guard during Vietnam.  Of course clear and convincing evidence has shown that Mr. Bush did not complete his required service in the Air National Guard, even though he was in a safe stateside slot. <br /> <br />The film also shows the heartfelt sadness of a mother who lost her son in Iraq.  Complete with a scene of a foolish Bush apologist in Washington, DC trying to persuade the woman who had lost a son that another woman protesting the war was not for real. <br /> <br />The film, of course, portends the change in American values set forth by the Bush administration, and their legions of self-serving cronies, apologists, and dupes.  The film also shows how the groundwork was laid for the United Sates to cast off the honorable goals of its framers to become a government of dishonor, torturers, liars, dupes for cash, dupes for free, and arrogant popinjays that thumb their noses at the Constitution, Congress, the courts, and of course the people of the United States.  Further, the film shows how the Bush administration has used 9/11 for constant political gain, and the justification for all manner of questionable and illegal activities by the Bush cabal. <br /> <br />We now know that the Bush administration has condoned and committed torture on human beings, unlawful renditions, illegal wiretapping on American citizens, and an ongoing list of desecrations to the Constitution. <br /> <br />They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security, deserve neither liberty or security.  -- Benjamin Franklin
B000002MP2|1.0|Why oh why are people saying that this is the best album in the universe? I'm sorry, but Green Day really annoys me. Kidz Bop has covered their songs and has done better on them than Green Day themselves. And excuse me, but someone on her--the user name was \\"punk sucks like pop,\\" or something like that--was saying that this was \\"kid stuff.\\" WHAT?! There is at least one explicitive in every song, and they're all very dark, lonely, depressing songs. One is even about suicide bombing! <br /> <br />I got this CD for Christmas one year, and when I saw the title I laughed like a hyena for twenty minutes. Dookie? Why Dookie? Is this some weird trend of the '90s? I put the album on and immediately found out what the reason for its name. It was a big pile of dookie, which is a synonym for \\"dung.\\"  <br /> <br />Seriously, I really think these guys are freaky. Good Charlotte's songs are hopeful. Their attitude is, \\"Hey, everything might be totally rotten now, but I know it'll get better.\\" Green Day's attitude is, \\"Everything's totally rotten, so I'll wear so much eye makeup no one can tell what my eye color is and I'll go write thirty songs promoting suicide, and maybe it'll get better.\\" <br /> <br />Then there's Billie Joe's \\"indecent exposure.\\" How can anyone say that this is \\"kid stuff\\" after hearing about THAT? <br /> <br />This is not \\"cool,\\" \\"rockin',\\" or \\"excellent.\\" It is scary and overdone. Good Charlotte is music. Joss Stone is music. The Black-Eyed Peas are music. John Hiatt is music. Drake Bell is music. The Beatles are music. The Click Five is music. Avril Lavigne is music. 3 Doors Down is music--and great music at that. These guys might be able to play instruments, but aside from that, they're not music. They're a trendy boy band that freaks me out.  <br /> <br />And to anyone who thinks that, judging by my eyeliner cut, that I only dislike them because of their looks--please. The lead singer of 3 Doors Down looks slightly like Frankenstein. The members of Good Charlotte have enough tattoos to join a carnival show. So it's not the looks, although they do look freaky, it's mostly the attitude and the lyrics.

B000301YY8|5.0|Webster's Dictionary defines bedlam as a place, scene or state of uproar and confusion. Every song on this debut album musically illustrates different states of emotional uproar and confusion. Each track on this CD has beautiful lyrics and wonderful melodies that penetrate your thoughts and spirit.<br /><br />The CD opens with a song to a euphoric dawn while ending with a song that illustrates the uproar of war and confusion. In between dawn and war there is homage to love at first sight, lost love, death, destroyed spirit, and personal reflection. I was touched by several of the songs. The entire CD is a journey of sorts beautiful and spiritually dark yet you're compelled to listen and enjoy the melodies and music.<br /><br />I did buy the CD for the track: You're Beautiful but upon listening to the entire CD I'd say that's the weakest track. My favorite tracks at this point are Goodbye My Lover, Cry, and Billy. How can you go wrong with lyrics so wonderful:<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soulmate. The damage is done.

It is unbelievable how much print Girsham dedicated to Italian language lessons, eating out and visiting historical sights. It cured me of ever wanting to read him again.
B000002LK1|5.0|<br />Synthpop has never been well seen. Rock purists always criticize it of cold and \\"pre-made\\". But it was until this album appeared. <br />This album is the perfect mixture of electronic athmospheres with guitar riffs. And -I am sure most of you are going to agree- without it, rockers would continue listening only to rock. <br />This wonderful modern gem kicks off with the amazing \\"World in my eyes\\", showing why Martin Gore is one of the best songwriters of our times. Deep and persuasive lyrics with the most fascinating sounds of electronica. <br />The album continues with \\"The Sweetest perfection\\", preparing us for the stunning \\"Personal Jesus\\", the anthem of an entire generation. <br />Depeche Mode surprises us with Halo, a semi-gothic seed from the redest rose. <br />Now that we are in completly darkness, we can enjoy \\"Waiting for the Night\\", a lullaby for those who live in the shadows. <br />Can anybody forget \\"Enjoy the Silence\\"? As well as Personal, this song is the favourite of thousands and is DM's most distinctive work. <br />Wasn't it enough, we find as next track \\"Policy of Truth\\", another chart topper. <br />The albums finishes with \\"Blue Dress\\" and \\"Clean\\", two clear examples of the Basildon's quartet's strenght. <br />Millions of units sold, sold out venues among other achievements that this album obtained, it stills sounds fresh, as if it was recorded yesterday. <br />Whether you like electronic music or not, you must get this album, for is one of the best albums ever made. It is without any doubt, one of the contenders for the best album of all times.
0307276902|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I read it because my 16 year old wanted to read it. I had heard about some of the controversy so I decided I should read it first. It was indeed heart wrenching. It did make me cry. There was foul language. People did suffer immense pain. It is about a dark side of life and how that side can, and often does, kill. I will allow my 16 year old to read it. Hopefully, it will help her recognize other aspects of life. What I was most intrigued by was all the hoopla this book received. Wether or not it was entirely true was not that important to the story. I find it fascinating that an alcoholic, crackhead addicted criminal can write such a poignant but basically bland book and make a million little dollars. It is the american way, Way to go James Frey.
B00003CWL6|4.0|\\"Look Closer\\", the tagline of Sam Mendes's film, \\"American Beauty\\" is exactly what you must do in order to enjoy this film. What many people miss is that hidden underneath a series of abstract events and symbols is an entertaining plot. Once you get past the sometimes grotesque situations, it is impossible to stop watching.  <br /> <br /> The exciting plot filled with countless twists and turns in the course of events may be what draws an audience on the surface, but it's the intriguing, thought provoking theme that leaves an audience thinking. The less than star-studded cast including Peter Gallagher and Kevin Spacey takes nothing away from the intellectual nature of the film; it even enforces the generic, nameless image Mendes aims for.  <br /> <br /> \\"American Beauty\\" earned well-deserved recognition by winning five of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for including best picture. Gallagher also brought home a best actor award and Mendes earned best director honors. <br /> <br /> The most intriguing aspect of \\"American Beauty\\" is its courage to tackle such controversial topics as homosexuality, child abuse, divorce, and the monotony of everyday suburbia. Mendes takes a bold approach to many issues that are usually off limits in Hollywood. He pushes the envelope in every area; therefore, he sets new limits for future movies.  <br /> <br /> Like \\"A Thin Red Line\\" and many other deep, hard-hitting films, voice-over narration provides much needed details and observations. For example, the very first scene includes voice-over where Mr. Burnham foreshadows the ending, but it takes even a careful watcher a few viewings to notice it. \\"American Beauty\\" is full of hidden things like this and it makes it even more fascinating.  <br /> <br /> Despite all of these brilliant features, the movie does tend to be a bit overly cynical and sometimes pushes reality too far. For instance, it's hardly believable that someone's life could really be as bad as Lester Burnham's.  <br /> <br /> Because it pushes the previous limits in the movies industry, is hard to turn off, and is deep yet understandable, \\"American Beauty\\" is one of Hollywood's greatest accomplishments in years. It sets the foundation for even more risky films in the future and starts the bar sky high.
B000002LCE|5.0|together with Holy Diver. Yes people, this album is as good as Holy Diver. It is a lot better then Sacred Heart which disapointed me a bit. Graig Goldy's guitarplay has something the same with Ritchie Blackmore's guitarplay. Very melodical and great solos. Ronnie James is in great vocal conditions, he sings very beautiful. Dream Evil is the best title track he has ever written. All The Fools Sailed Away is one of the best powerballads ever! My favorites here are: Dream Evil, All The Fools Sailed Away and Faces In the Window! The rest is also very very very very good! If you are a metal fan or a hardrock fan then you must own this album! So, if you don't own it yet, BUY IT!
1400032717|4.0|I'd totally recommend this book.  It may not be the most extraordinary story ever written, but it's pretty darn good.  It's so different from anything that I've ever read.  At first the style seems a but strange, but the you get into it.  Before I read this, I didn't really know that much about how an autistic person could bahve.  After reading it I have a little glimpse into what their lives are like.  It's informative without being all boring. <br />   Basically, the story revolves around a boy trying to solve a neighborhood mystery.  In the process of \\"detective\\" work he uncovers things you never would have expected.  You see the effect an autistic child can have on family. <br />   Certain things in this book seem unecessary, but it gets good again before you have time to get bored.  You'll read through this book in no time.

B00005JOMY|5.0|Once you realize this movie isn't a porno, it's actually pretty good. Yeah, I was disappointed at first, but instead of hunting down the red light district I actually decided to stay. Besides, porn is accessible 24/7, but a movie this funny only comes around once in a while. <br /> <br />The plot revolves around Harry Lockhart played by Robert Downey Jr., a petty thief turned aspiring actor who soon finds himself in the midst of an old fashioned film noir plot. Val Kilmer plays Gay Perry, a private detective who is hired to show Harry the ropes for his potential new role. When someone from Harry's past shows...actually, the plot is really just a MacGuffin for the two actors to spout off clever lines at one another, and the movie itself seems keenly aware of this. In fact, Robert Downey's character narrates the film complete with fourth wall shattering comments (such as referencing the audiences in Times Square). His narration could have come off as annoying, but thanks to the strong script and funny delivery it works perfectly. <br /> <br />The entire film is really just an excuse for these two actors to play off of each other, and they do a fantastic job. Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. can be two of the most frustrating actors. Sometimes they can seem so self-conscious that it's painful, and other times they can turn in a role that singlehandedly makes the movie (Val Kilmer in Tombstone for example). Here they're at the top of their game. They play off of each other perfectly. If you like smart sardonic humour, then you'll like this movie. <br /> <br />It's so difficult these days to find a good comedy that this movie felt refreshing. It feels like it has been over a decade since I've actually laughed out loud in a movie theatre. Most comedies are run by the Will Ferrell rule of comedy: if you yell it's automatically funnier. It's nice to know that someone out there thinks that a clever script can be funny too.  (This is not a complete knock to Will Ferrell--he can be funny in the right role). <br /> <br />The qualities of this film don't stop at the humor. There's also some great send-up of film noir. For a noir fan like myself, this was merely icing on the cake. Not only does the film pay tribute to old fashion noir, but takes an opportunity to subvert it whenever it gets the chance. Film noir cliches are raised so they can be turned on their head. <br /> <br />Hopefully this film will get the audience it deserves when it comes out on DVD.  It's easily one of the years funniest movies, and it's not even a straight up comedy.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|From the first moment Michael Buble graces the stage I found myself in awe of his impressive skill set - he can sing, he can dance, he can make you laugh and he has that 'it' quality that just makes you want to take him home! <br />My husband enjoyed the dvd as much as I did, no small feat considering he is usually asleep ten minutes after any movie comes on! He's now a fan and really enjoyed the showmanship and Michael's great voice and song choices. <br />His appearance on Ellen DeGeneres yesterday morning was like icing on my entertainment cake and I highly recommend this package. The music cd contains songs from the live show as well as others that were not caught on film.  <br />Consider us happily Caught by Caught in the Act!
0385507755|5.0|Despite all the controversy, the essense of this book rings true with readers.  James Frey is an incredibly talented writer, and could not have written this book without the hell he went through.  The things that were exaggerated and fabricated don't take away from the true meaning of the book and what I took away from it.  I am reading \\"My Friend Leonard\\" now and it is just as enthralling.  I cannot wait to read anything else he writes.  Everyone has to remember that he is a human being - he has faults just like the rest of us.  Nothing that has come out in the controversy takes away from his talent... I highly recommend this book.
0071410945|5.0|I have a small collection of books that I consider \\"private stock\\". These are books that I never lend and I read over and over. This book is a private stock favorite. James Young has created one of the best books I have ever read on the process of creative thinking. The technique is simple and it works. I have applied this technique to a variety of situations when I needed \\"outside the box\\" solutions and it has never failed me.  \\"A Technique for Producing Ideas\\" is an extraordinary book. It is a book that will make you wonder about the power of the mind and the nature of consciousness itself.
B0007PAMR4|2.0|Previous to this review, I posted a review having made the mistake of watching the extended edition first...    I am actually glad I bought the dvd reissue of this messed up genius of a film. But I do believe if Lynch had been given a longer leash and more of a free hand it would of been quite wondrous. Imagine cramming 2 LOTR films into 2 and a half hours.    Model work and miniature photography: The spaceships were quite nicely designed except for the ornithopter, but the model work and photography looked a bit rushed.    Script: Overbearing voice overs and introspective expositionary self speeches ad nauseum. Cheesy dialogue, especially from the Fremen. The close up of Yuehs moustache when he repeats \\"the tooth\\", is unintentionally hilarious. The first half of the films pacing felt natural, the last half, extremely rushed.    Editing: rushed    Soundtrack: Orchestral segment, just fine...Eno even better. Toto segment was fine in parts, cheesy guitar head banging in others.    Stunt work: One scene had a stunt man bounce over the back of another from what was obviously a trampoline. Can't believe editing didn't catch it.    Acting: Not too bad, especially from \\"Yueh\\" Anywhere Sting or \\"Rabban\\" is in frame, go get some popcorn.    Location photography: What location photography? Where are the giant, breathtaking desert vistas that this kind of \\"epic\\" demands?...oh, that's what sound stages are for.    Extended version: I dig the extra scenes, but the completely uninterested editing and lazy cut and paste continuity blunders make the glaring mistakes catapult you out of the story. The extended version also takes out all those Lynch touches that added some real visual surreality to the theatrical cut and made it worth watching despite the flaws! In short, sometimes less is more, especially when you flush the poetry for the prose.    The good news: Costume design and make up were beautiful, the stillsuits were quite amazing (Thank you Bob Ringwood). the interior set design was delicious as well. The set design and direction on the Harkonen homeworld are especially tasty.    My dream would be to cross Lynch's direction and movie design with the script from the mini-series. As the costume and backdrops of the TV series was laughter inducing it was so stagey.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Dear God is this movie bad.  Unwatchable doesn't begin to describe it.  As far as I can tell, 'Starship Troopers' is a parody that isn't actually trying to be amusing.  People like to tell you this movie is actually smart.  Not true.  The satiric elements are scattered and slipshod and don't add up to anything.  Ya see, it's a modern sci-fi but it's kinda like an old war film too and it's playing up the reputedly fascistic aspects of those movies and the mentality that bred them. Uh huh.  I do believe that that was the point of the movie, but merely trying to say *something* doesn't qualify a film as smart.  I also find it decidedly offensive that the film is essentially making a mockery of the source material.  I have no great love for the novel, though it's fine for what it is, but this is just a matter of principle I guess.  You can attack Heinlein's values and world view if you like, but come up with your own damn story to do it in.  EDIT: A later reviewer tried to say the fact that it specifically uses 'Starship Troopers' is what makes it 'work'.  You miss the point, which I suppose I didn't make clearly enough: Parody is fine, this is parody masquerading as adaptation which is highly misleading and inappropriate.  That and it's just stupid, as 95% of the people who are gonna see this film never read the novel, or even heard of it, most likely.  All this is just a sidenote, and isn't really relevant to enjoying the film: It's unwatchable either way.<br /><br />But all this is senseless prating, no more meaningful than the silly wordgames played by those who are trying to intellectualize this film.  The film is simply unwatchable.  It's literally painful to watch it.  Verhoven just went way, way too far.  The action utterly sucks despite the great looking bugs, and the over the top performances are sheer torture.  Normally I try and go into details but it's just beyond my ability here.  How anyone can watch this and not long for death is beyond me. (Well, I can understand bearing it the first time thru, as I did.  It was mind-bogglingly terrible yes, but I had to see it thru.  It was only after coming across it repeatedly that I fully realized the depth of its depravity.)<br /><br />Verhoven does have some talent. 'Robocop' is quite amusing, and it is, at it's heart, much the same thing.  But the stylizing and intentional stupidity in this movie just got way, way out of hand and there isn't any real movie left.  Or, maybe it was meant to get completely out of hand, and the movie was intended to be unbearable.  If so, I congratulate Paul on his success, though I question the widom of his decision.<br /><br />Grade: Funderstand bearing it the first time thru, as I did.

B0000524E5|2.0|This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.<br /><br />This is one of the basic plots.  THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk.  Why do we keep watching this junk?  A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.<br /><br />OK, here goes:  beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows.  Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.<br /><br />Not recommended.  Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist.
0440238609|3.0|The story kept me intrigued, as many do, but the overall effect didn't wow me. Oh, the whole series is worth the reading, if you've already gone through some of the better ones out there. <br /> <br />I even liked newcomer Brian S. Pratt's The Unsuspecting Mage better. It has wars, magic, secret passages all the while a solid story line keeps it flowing smoothly and logically. If you like epic fantasy try this one. It's a bit rough it being his frist ever novel, but well worth the read.
B00005JL78|5.0|This film satisfies on all levels:  acting is great, the story complex yet believable, deliciously quirky details on life in the future from personalized advertising via retina recognition to scurryng intelligent police robots, and even philosophical issues about fate and choice and service to the state.  While the plot is that of a murder mystery, the themes are the choices that new technologies and a re-made society offer us.<br /><br />Cruise is really a wonderful actor, in spite of all the weird stuff written about him that may even be true - just look at this performance.  He is super competent, athletic, and a natural leader, but also a tormented soul, completely convincingly.  This is one of his best performances, which made me a genuine fan.  Colin Ferrel and van Sydow are also excellent, as are many of the other characters.  About the only weakness that strained credibility for me were the pre-cogs - their parts were too weird and their powers unexplained, essentially magical.  Nonetheless, there is an extremely well developed vision of a future society here, right down to every detail.  It makes for an intricate plot and many many ideas, so that it can be viewed many times, which is the key to a great film experience.<br /><br />Though I had already seen it several times, upon reviewing I was once again enthralled by the vision - you can view it on many levels.  It is a masterpiece and indeed one of the best scifi films I have even seen, destined to become a classic on the level of Forbidden Planet.<br /><br />Warmly recommended, if hard scifi is your bag.

0385507755|5.0|Well first of all I thought A Million Little Pieces by James Frey, was a great book.  This story is about him overcoming drug addiction and the road he took to overcome it. Frey wrote this book as a memoir about himself and his drug addiction but now we are finding out that some things he said in there weren't true. Personally, I think he is a strong man to overcome all of that.  I mean he did embellish about eighteen pages, but who doesn't embellish things or over exaggerate?   This world would be boring if people didn't exaggerate things. I think people are just bored and James Frey came in the spotlight at the wrong time and people were waiting on something little to pick on.  Oprah, ok I am just going to get right into it. She was really cruel.  People say she nice and all of that yea right she was just doggin him on national television to get better reviews.  I mean who cares how many days he was in prison or in the holding cell, also about changing the names he was just trying to protect people's identity.  I know I would do the same thing.  He was in there and that's all that matters also about the girl who committed suicide, I mean we don't have to have exact details he is just trying to get a point across that she did, he was just trying to protect peoples identity.  One thing that I don't understand is how people could be so bored that they actually do research on someone's life when its not even a paper to write for school or work or etc.  Really people shouldn't accuse someone if they don't know them, because they don't know they're past and don't have any room to accuse someone.  Also I think he changed a lot of stuff around because first of all this book was written with his memory and me personally knowing drug addicts and recovering addicts they don't really have a memory and so this book was based on his memory of rehab and of the 6 weeks in rehab.  Also I think people need to be careful what they say and do to James because I am afraid he will go back to drugs because of everything that has been going on.  Well really what it all comes down to is just let people alone and let them do what they do.

0385510454|4.0|I don't know what some of the reviewers here are talking about. This book was a true page turner. I extremely enjoyed this book, in fact I read it in 3 days, barely put it down. The reason I gave this a 4 is because the last page, the ending, it seems to be missing something. The ending left a lot of questions and maybe this is for a reason. Grisham may have left this open for another book about Joel, I mean Marco, I mean... Well you get the point. Anyways I highly suggest reading this. Good job Mr. Grisham!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This CD is excellent !!  Cold Play has really put together a great group of songs for this CD. I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.
B000063JZQ|5.0|I found that the movie was really fun. Considering that the movie was done in the 70s its fairly impressive, and amazingly entertaining. Aside from the subtle plot tinkerings the movie summed the story up very well. Though this movie is no Lord of the Rings, the movie was directed well enough that I was interested to see what would happen next, which is something no ShakesSpeare story has ever done so succesfully. <br />Though I wouldn't suggest this movie for people who are new to the story, I believe that after reading the actual play that watching this movie is a real treat.  <br />If you have some spare time on your hands next weekened you may want to check this movie out, its worth watching.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently discovered Firefly through a friend, and I have to say how sorry I am that I missed it when it was on TV!  This show is great!  I started off by renting them, but then found that it wasn't good enough.  I had to have them.  I'm still praying for a miracle that more of Firefly will come out someday...but in the meantime I can rewatch the DVDs.  All fans have to own them.  And if you aren't a fan yet, you haven't watched enough!!!
0452282152|3.0|I picked this up as I have become interested in historical fiction; it is my first Chevalier novel.  I thought the writing was pretty; it pulled me into the time period.  However, the story was simple and seemed a little overplayed.  The book was full of the maid's daily chores and understated infatuation with her master. <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with book it just will not be a challenging read.
B000007T1M|5.0|This is definitely SOAD's best especially compared to their newer Hypnotize material where Serj gets less vocal time. If you're new to getting into System of a Down, I suggest not starting with this CD immediately because it might turn you off and perhaps starting with Mezmerize or Toxicity, but this CD is amazing and true to the creativeness and craziness of SOAD. All of this album's songs are outstanding, but I am not as crazy about Suggestions and Peephole as I am the rest.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|The classical Christmas tale gets a reworking here by Sesame Street's Muppet characters, more or less, becoming a highly entertaining new modern day classic.  Not only does it feature trademark enjoyable songs, but the storytelling is amazing and the cinematic splendor created by the film is breathtaking.  The third ghost is a little scary for kids (since I remember in the mid-90s being freaked of it), but the film is still a great piece of movie extraordinaire none the less.  Truly amazing.
0062502182|4.0|This was a really nice story.  It was simplistic in its message/theme, and is only about 120 pages (about a 2 hour read).  Mr. Coelho combines the art of destined elements contributing to Santiago's (main character) own ultimate descision and realization. <br />   <br />I confess that reading it did change my view on life.  It really resonated with me on a personal level.  I now am in search of my true \\"personal legend\\" and respect the author for envoking this.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I remember seeing this film back in the early 70s and was mesmerized by the 1930s visual and aural feel of the film and the emotional dynamic of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal. Thirty years later, this film has not lost any of these qualities, and given that I am 30 years older, I appreciate this film far more than I ever did. A delightful story that takes place in the middle of the Depression in middle America, Paper Moon is the story of a father/daughter con artist team (Moses Pray/Addie Loggins) who go from town to town swindling people in an outlandish yet believable manner, and in the process both develop a need for one another that goes beyond the financial. Tatum O'Neal's ability to emote her feelings through her simple yet powerful facial expressions and her intelligent dialogue is so convincing that you see her subtlely transform from a seemingly innocent child to a worldly adult who understands human nature just as much as the grown-ups around her. Tatum's portrayal of Addie is truly uncanny and what makes it so poignant is the fact that she had no formal training as an actress prior to the movie's production.  <br /> <br />This movie is also the high-water mark of Ryan O'Neal's career despite the fact his career was just starting in the 1970s. I cannot recall any other film he did where his acting was crisp and so in the moment with his character's effort to improvise and take advantage of unsuspecting patsies. However, Moses Pray's equal as a scoundrel is truly Addie Loggins (if not, his superior), and their many scenes together (the unforgettable diner scene and the ones when they're driving in the open country) capture verbally and non-verbally their uneasy yet developing father/daughter relationship. The black and white cinematography which uses in-depth focus, wideangle shots (i.e., all objects in the background and foreground are in clear focus) faithfully draws the viewer right into the Depression era and the emotional settings of not just one character butall characters depicted in every frame. Bogdonovich's directorial efforts provide seamless continuity, and the film retains its simple yet evocative feel. This is truly one of the best low-key comedy/drama classics ever and am surprised it has not received the recognition of artistry it truly deserves.  <br /> <br />The DVD (excellent quality image, sound, and special features) and the praise above makes this product Five Stars all the way !!! <br />
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Evidently fear of a long movie was the mindkiller for Universal and Dino De Laurentiis when it came to releasing David Lynch's \\"Dune\\" to theaters. Lynch managed to trim down his epic film to 2 hours and 17 minutes compressing Frank Herbert's marvelous, complex convoulted and massive novel into a single movie experience. There was lots of footage that ended up on the cutting room floor some of it deservedly so some not. Just be cautious if you purchase this at retail. Every copy save the one I purchased was loose in the tin packaging. Shake it and if you hear something bounding around don't buy it.<br /><br />What we get here is the \\"Ultimate\\" edition of the film so far. Lynch's original vision and on the flipside of this DVD18 the \\"Extended Version\\" that played on the Sci-Fi Channel. Both are presented in anamorphic widescreen (the extended edition for the first time). Both look good although there's lots of dirt and debris that could easily have been cleaned up by Universal. Instead they essentially used the same transfer as before for the theatrical version of the film. Colors are solid throughout for both versions. Sound is extremely good with a 5.1 mix for the first time on the extended version of the film. At three hours there is a certain amout of repetition of plot points (which is why some scenes were cut). It's a pity Lynch wasn't involved in the editing as he would have, no doubt, had a plan for reediting this material into a cohesive superior film.<br /><br />We get the following extras: deleted scenes with an introduction by producer Raffaella De Laurentiis. She disspells the myth that Lynch had a four hour version of the film ready to go and that it's floating around there somewhere. Certainly there was a rough cut but it wasn't anywhere near the finished condition necessary for release. No doubt it would have cost a lot to remix, redub (bringing back the actors) finish the effects (this was before CGI)and rescore. So what we have here is a compromise with both versions. We also have four excellent featurettes with plenty of clips, behind-the-scenes footage of Lynch shooting the movie. Lynch doesn't appear in any of the new featurettes nor does he provided a commentary as he clearly wasn't happy with the release of the extended version on DVD. The featurettes contain interviews with the visual effects supervisors discussing their work on the models, miniatures and the designers discussing the challenge of creating the costumes and the different \\"worlds\\" some of which Lynch had strong concepts about.<br /><br />The extended version for those who haven't seen it also includes a narrative that gives too much information although it duplicates part of the narration that Virginia Madsen does for the theatrical cut as Princess Irulan. The collectable tin case looks extemely good but if you buy this at retail shake them; I discovered a whole bunch where the discs were floating around loose inside. There's also a one sheet which gives the chapters, definitions (similar to the definition sheet given out in some theaters for the premiere)of the phrases and words used throughout the film and also a list of the extras.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Lynch's vision flaws and all because the \\"Extended Edition\\" (put together by the studio without Lynch's involvement which is why the direction is credited to the ubiquitous \\"Alan Smithee\\" and the screenplay (also written by Lynch) to \\"Judas Booth\\".

0385507755|4.0|The book is an interesting look at addiction and the bottomless pit one finds themselves when facing such demons.  The controversy over this book is much about nothing and the slime out there filing lawsuits over \\"lost time\\" in reading this book represents more of a social commentary that anything in this book or Frey's alleged embellishments.  Regardless whether this book is completely factual misses the point.  How accurate was Hunter S. Thompson's descriptions of his hallucinations in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas?  No, no the evil giant bats where blue, not black.....  The biggest scoundrel in all of this has to be Oprah and her shattered ten-story ego, to bad she can't raise that back up in humility.  She elevated this man, James Frey from obscurity to prominence and then fed him to the snakes that comprise much of the literary world.  My only question to James Frey is not why did you embellish your story, but perhaps, just maybe were you treated better passed out in a back alley, stained with vomit than you have been in the last several weeks?
B00005JMJG|3.0|As it often happens, a great concept is being ruined by horrible acting and awkward dialogue.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Over past few years we have been treated to a number of fantasy films that did their best to look like moving Tolkien's calendars. Well, the thing is that I don't look for \\"real goblins\\" or \\"real talking beavers\\" in a fantasy movie, I'd rather have something - something not quite real, maybe even fantastic for the lack of the better word. That's where Mirrormask leaves all of them, all of these new CGI-generated balrogs with CGI-generated pimples, in the dust. Cinematically it's akin to Brazil, Time Bandits, and Kin-dza-dza with their totally original worlds with new histories, geographies, even physics and metaphysics. That's cinematically. Storywise it goes back to Gaiman's classics - Neverwhere, Stardust, and American Gods - where the protagonist moves along from the banal to mandane, when - wham! - fan hits the poop back, and ya'll find yourselves on the wrong side of the mirror. In these difficult times, when Terry Gilliam sealed his abdication with the release of the heinous Brothers Grimm, I find a glimmer of hope - reflected off the Mirrormask. And now to the 4th beer...
1932100385|5.0|The China Study is written by an author with an extremely scientific way of thinking and also, his son. With all I've learned about nutrition so far, it's really hard to disagree with someone who says you should eat a bunch of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables as opposed to meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and processed plant foods. The human body has a lot more in common with herbivores than carnivores from the jaw to the end of the digestive tract. The final section about the corruption in the food industries and the government agencies that come up with nutritional guidelines was just as enjoyable as the three previous sections. This was quite simply the best book on diet and nutrition I've ever read.

B000001DTM|5.0|What a great record!!! It might not be the best of the decade, but it was my favorite.  And hey, that's all the matters. <br /> <br />This is by far my favorite u2 album.  I do enjoy them as a band, and I put them in my top 10 groups of all time, but I haven't really enjoyed them as much since this release.  They still rock, but \\"Achtung Baby\\" is when these guys were untouchable.   <br /> <br />\\"Zoo Station\\" is a great lead off track, it's such a funky tune and still has some great lyrics.  \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" are both hits that you can dance to, which was unheard of for a u2 song before this album came out.  They both rock, especially \\"Mysterious Ways\\".  It made me start paying attention to Adam Clayton, their bassist, who I thought before this record was a good player, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br />\\"One\\" is probably my favorite u2 song ever.  It's just perfectly written, it's been 15 years since I heard it and I still get chills sometimes listening to it....now THAT'S music!!! <br /> <br />I was shocked when I heard \\"Until the End of the World\\" because it was so un-U2 like.  It is a great rocker, but nothing compares to the \\"FLY\\"....WOW!!!! Edge's best guitar work, that man is a guitar genius.  It's just one of the coolest songs I've ever heard. <br /> <br />There are some others that I really like on here that weren't hits.  \\"Acrobat\\" is incredible, as is \\"Ultraviolet\\".  All the songs on here are good, just get the CD!! <br /> <br />u2 are not the greatest musicians in the world, and definetly not the best improvisors in the game.  But they are based and run on emotion, and when their good, they own a uniqueness in rock music that is so original.  Rock legends.

This album is painfully dull when listening in its entirety. \\"Enter Sandman\\" is a good move into the pop metal world but they do not have another song that compares throughout the rest of the album. \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" are absolutely terrible song compositions and I say this with a heartfelt honesty.  They are too long and become stale after the first couple of minutes. \\"Sad But True\\" isnt the worst song on the album but it doesn't compare to other bands from the genre who've been ignored. \\"Where Ever I May Roam\\" is another average metal song that has a big bombastic crunch but is thin and weak. Bands like Testament and Megadeth when commericalized released more diverse and interesting albums.  I've always found Metallica to be overrated and a bit overblown. I know millions will disagree and millions of sold albums blah blah blah... Captain & Tennelle & Mariah Carey have also sold millions so your not making a very good point...

B0006399FS|3.0|Or maybe George W. Bush and the B-Man wrote them together.  It's kind of sad because the guitarists of the band are really doing great.  Edge is the guitar wizard as always.  And Adam Clayton has become an incredible bass player over the years, I feel like this might be his best album.  And Larry, well he's Larry...never that great of a drummer but solid.  But despite some highlights, Bono just doesn't step up the game.   <br /> <br />I grew up on u2 and love them.  But after \\"Zooropa\\", I started to listen to them less but still picked up all the records.  I just feel Bono could write these songs in his sleep.  It's like he's happy being this huge band, and the band doesn't challenge themselves anymore because they know they can write songs like \\"Vertigo\\" which will sell millions. <br /> <br />-I enjoyed \\"Vertigo\\" until the I-Pod Ad.  The guitar riff and the bass playing is top notch. <br />-\\"Miracle Drug\\" is good and has a beautiful solo by Edge, but terribly cliched lyrics ruin the song and keep it from being truly great. <br />-\\"Sometimes...\\" is a decent ballad but the lyrics are too straightforward.  \\"You're the reason I sing?\\" Come on...\\"Stuck in a Moment\\" off the last record kills it. <br />-\\"Love and Peace or Else\\" has it's moments but is nothing special.  Bono's lyrics are so horrible.  \\"Where is the love?\\" repeated over and over.  How cliche and unoriginal is that? <br />-\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is awesome, kind of has that 80's feel to it.  If it wasn't for some horrible production, would be up there with the great u2 songs in their catalogue. <br />-\\"All Because of You\\" is a really good rocker, but the chorus is lacking.  But it's an in-your-face tune, and it works. <br />-\\"A Man and a Woman\\"....OK, what were you guys thinking? The only thing that keeps this from being the worst u2 song ever is the bassline by Clayton. <br />-\\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is the Africa song that we knew we would hear from Bono. Give it a rest...we all admire you for your work but keep it separate from the music.  Love the way the song kicks off though. <br />-\\"One Step Closer\\" is an atmoshperic kind of tune.  Nothing great, but fits well with the album.  Lyrics are weak. <br />-\\"Original of the Species\\" is another strong song which is a lot like \\"Blinding Lights\\" because the production isn't good at all.  Still, it's a good Beatles rip off and is one of the best tunes on the record. <br />-\\"Yahweh\\" is maybe the worst closer on any u2 album.  I don't even want to talk about it. <br /> <br />I'm hard on these guys because they are legends.  Bono needs to stop prancing around the white house and meeting with politicians.  Get in the studio and come up with something fresh, start hanging out with Jagger and Springstein again instead of Bush and Blair.   <br /> <br />U2 have to go in a new direction.  This record has it's moments, but it seems to lacking that magic.  I think that magic existed when U2 were experimenting.  Bono definetly still has the voice and the charisma, he's still all got all the tools.  He just needs to spend more time in the tool shed.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I've seen this movie four times in the theater and twice on DVD and I still love every second of it. Excellent performances from great actors and a noble and uplifting story make this an exceptional movie. Of course, it can be a little anachronistic,but it makes for a higher type of entertainment nevertheless.
B0006L16N8|2.0|\\"Parachutes\\" was a very impressive debut.  \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" was amazing, one of the best of 2002.   <br /> <br />But come on, now with this third release, all three records sound the exact same.  Martin moaning on the piano, and background music that was ripped off from a bunch of different bands. <br /> <br />\\"Speed of Sound\\" is terrible, what an awful song.  \\"Fix You\\" is way better, that's a great tune.  The CD has it's moments.   <br /> <br />I do enjoy Coldplay, their first two albums are played regularly on my CD player.  But by the next album, the media that's loving everything they do will say \\"Are you guys ever going to change it up?\\"  Then the fans will follow.  They have one or two albums left before they get the backlash.  Enjoy it while you can, because I can't see Coldplay changing their sound.
B000286S8S|3.0|I used to own this a couple of years ago,but I became immediately dissatisfied with the fact that the band never kept its promise of releasing \\"Best of Van Halen vol.2\\". There are 36 songs here and the worst songs are the embarassing three new songs that the band recorded with Sammy.Another complaint is the essay included which has very poor photographs and uninspired writing.I believe that a band with such a loyal following owes its many fans over the years a lot more than this... What adds insult to injury is the fact that the three awful songs that introduce this compilation force the listener to press \\"skip\\" all the time. So,I guess, let's wait for the next Van Halen reunion of some sorts and the complimentary compilation with three new songs:\\"Best of the Best volume 3\\". Next time, just make them the last three tracks...
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I'm still not sure where to put this album in the heirarchy of depeche mode albums, but initial impressions are favorable.  I'm not a big fan of the loud jarring bit at the beginning of the second track, but other than that blemish (and the fact I think my cd is a badly pressed copy so there are 'skips' in two songs) I think this was a worthwhile purchsase.
0897500482|5.0|Let's face it. This book was put together after Bruce lee died. The editor collected \\"notes\\" many of them copied word for word from previously published books. The \\"Tao\\" is hard to understand and hard tyo read. So why give it 5 stars? Because it represents an important part of JKD history. It has already sold hundreds of thousands of copies. You should buy one too.
0307276902|5.0|Amazing. That is the only word that I find suitable while describing this book. Whether or not every incident, every detail, every fact is true or not, this book is amazing!  <br /> <br />I jumped on the \\"Pieces\\" bandwagon after seeing this book everywhere I turned for months and I never looked back. James Frey is a brilliant writer and held my attention from the minute I picked the book up to the last page. I found myself staying up late at night, reading at stop lights in my car, and reading every spare moment I had in hopes to find out what would happen next. I fell in love with the characters, whether they were addicts or counselors. I cried sad tears for him when he was angry, in pain, or scared and I cried proud tears when he was victorious. You cannot help but be drawn into the story by his unique style.  <br /> <br />Although I understand that some of the facts were embellished and that some readers feel as though they have been lied too, I think if that is what you walk away from this book with, you missed the boat. If everyone could step down from their high horses for 5 minutes and appreciate this book for what it is, they may cheer his victory instead of cheering his defeat. James Frey is a recovering addict who has turned his life around and for that I applaud him! He has taken a life that most of us would have left to die or given up on and he has recovered and succeeded and made something of himself. He has also taken addiction, something most of us will never know that closely, and made it forefront in our minds. He gave America a chance to speak openly about addiction in our offices, breakrooms, and book clubs.  <br /> <br />As a relative of a Crack addict, I am forever thankful for Frey's thoughts and experience. I'm thankful for the chance to get inside the mind of an addict and learn how my family member must feel most of the time. I know now that addiction is often bigger then the person it controls instead of my preconceived notion that you caneasily control the addiction.   <br /> <br />If you are considering reading this book, please do! Do not let embellished details tarnish this amazing tale. Applaud Frey for his recovery, his fight to \\"hold on\\", and especially for his talent. This book has truly changed my heart and mind and I for one cannot wait to read another Frey book!

0440178002|5.0|\\"Popular\\" is a dirty word in literary criticism. (Read Tom Wolfe's essay \\"My Three Stooges\\" in \\"Hooking Up.\\" for all the background you'll ever need to support that statement. \\"Shogun\\" is a great read and it is a great novel. It belongs with Dickens and \\"Lonesome Dove\\" in the canon of literary art that has achieved popular immortality. What sets it apart, especially from Dickens, though not so much from McMurtry, is that Clavell was pretty much a hack, aside from this transcendant achievement. \\"King Rat\\", his first novel, is the only other book he wrote that rises above the mire of his almost unbearably melodramatic oriental dramas. Not that they don't tell a good story, but the writing in \\"Tai-Pan\\" and especially \\"Noble House\\" is just embarassingly bad (and \\"Whirlwind\\" is unreadable). The man is dead and we'll never know the answer to how he could have produced this jewel amid his other rubbish, but it doesn't really matter. Forget the mini-series and the disgrace of having Richard Chamberlain (!!??)in the lead role. Forget everything you ever heard or thought about this book and popular fiction as art. Read the first 50 pages and try to stop.The book will stay with you forever. You will take scenes out and replay them in your mind and treasure them. Thank you, Mr. Clavell, wherever you are. <br />
B00004Y6O9|5.0|The evolution of Rock Guitar playing:<br />1. Chuck Berry<br />2. Jimi Hendrix<br />3. Jeff Beck/Jimmy Page<br />4. Edward Van Halen.<br />5. C'mon there's hasn't been anyone since then...<br /><br />When Eddie erupted (pretty punny) on the music scene way back in the day (I was a senior in \\"High\\" School), his outrageously phenomenal extravagonzo guitar playing basically blew away all the reigning guitar gods who thought they were cool (a few were pretty decent, though) and had them all scrambling to learn and re-create the supersonic sounds that came so easy to Sensei Eddie Van Halen.  Every song on this album is basically an advanced lesson in futuristic guitar playing.  Nowadays, anyone and their grandmother's grandmother can do hyperdrive hammer ons and pull offs sprinkled with some telepathic psycho harmonic doorbells concluding with a kamikaze dive bomb whammy bar...but way back then, it was Eddie.  Just like Jimmy with a violin bow, it was Eddie and his tapping.  He introduced these techniques and more to us mere mortal guitar wankers weaned on Marino, Montrose, Nuge, Travers, Trower, and Derringer.  Another thing, Eddie's practiced in the art of D&D; Denial and Deception.  He claims he's influenced by Clapton when really it's Jeff Beck.  Sure he knows a few Clapton licks but he did this to throw all guitar pretenders off his trail.  Listen to Beck and you'll see.  At that time only a young Randy Rhodes matched Eddie for sheer extreme virtuosity.  He's another favorite of mine and I will soon comment.  Van Halen's debut album has to be ranked as one of the top 10 best rock albums of all time.  It is truly pioneering and hey, I haven't even mentioned Diamond Dave yet.  Okay, in a nutshell: bar none, he's the best rock frontman ever.  But that's another story.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|First and foremost, Radiohead sucks so much ass it's rediculous. Second of all, Muse sounds in no way like Radiohead does. Muse actually rocks, while Radiohead makes me want to abuse heroin. <br />This album is flawless. <br />Also, I don't really care what anyone has to say, especially if you want to attack me about the Radiohead comments. They suck. Muse rocks. End of Story.
0440238609|5.0|If you read one book in your life, make it this one!  This book is one of the most amazing texts that I have ever read in my life.  Phillip Pullman paints the characters so well that I felt like I knew his characters better than I know my closest friends.  This book changed the way I look at my world.  I read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife when I was in high school, and I was hooked.  I have read tons of amazing fantasy and adventure books but this tops all of them.  Just a few weeks ago I went back and started reading the series over again, but this time The Amber Spyglass was out so I didn't have to suffer like I did in high school by not knowing the ending.  These books are amazing!  Lyra is a character that I fell in love with in the first book in a way that I thought I'd never fall in love with another character.  Then, in the second book Pullman introduces his readers to Will who is just as loveable a character.  I sat on the edge of my seat as I experienced the impossible challenges these two children face, and the amazing creatures they met along the way.  I always thought that The Lord of the Rings would be my favorite series of all time, but it pales in comparison to Pullman's series.  These characters and the ideas in these books will stay in my heart forever, and I'll always wonder what my own dameon looks life (a being you'll learn about in the book).

B000AMJDHY|4.0|Alright, there is just one problem with this band, and its the song title  \\"The Only Difference Between Suicide and Martrydom is Press Coverage\\". Now regularily, I would love this title, its catchy and is an amazing comment on society/media/our perceptions as such. But the problem is, I first ran into this phrase in Survivor, Chuck Palahniuk's book released Jan 4th 2000, clearly much ahead of this band's time in the spotlight(also an amazing book for anyone interested). This really is a nitpick, but I just have a big problem with people possibly going on and using this as a point for the cleverness of the band, when really its straight from Palahniuk, not even a subtle one liner, its the catch phrase for the entire book. So, thats my 2 cents, not a comment on the music, just their blatant disregard for original material etc. I'm sure it could have been a huge coincidence, or I'm sure someone could scrounge up another instance of this line, but thats how I see it, and I'm stickin with Chuck on this one.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|It's a great movie, which clearly sends a message against the dark side of (illegal) arms trade. Movie brings out a number of facts that would never have been imagined by an ordinary person.
0307276902|1.0|So I bought this book through Amazon as it had been recommended to me by a co-worker.  And the first 40 pages were so addicting that I went online to the publisher's site, [...] and there are some notes there.  Fairly innocent embellishments from what I read.  OK that's fine and I can understand that.   <br /> <br />But now I have to see just what kind of embellishments were made.  I go to the site that broke the news, [...] and after reading the 6 pages there of what was uncovered I was shocked.  These are not embellishments these are flat out lies.  This rich frat boy duped me.   <br /> <br />So now armed with the truth I'm reading page 94 which talks about his rap sheet, which is covered in detail by the smoking gun.  And all a person can do is shake your head, lies, falsehoods, fabrications is all I see, and on page 95 he sums it up with \\"It tells the truth, and as awful as it can be, the truth is what matters.\\"?? <br /> <br />I really just want to vomit on this book of hypocrisy, that I can barley read it at this point.  The truth is what matters, and I wonder if reading another 300 pages of false attitudes, people, and events is worth it.  I'm certainly finding it an easy addiction to drop. <br />

B0002S947K|5.0|I didn't hear this CD until late 2005, and it's a shame! I wish I had heard it sooner. Ray LaMontagne is an incredible singer/songwriter. I have since turned all of my friends onto him. After letting them hear this CD, they were all begging me for copies. I definitely recommend this CD. My favorite tracks are \\"Forever My Friend\\" and \\"Hold You in my Arms\\". If you like this guy, try Amos Lee.
B000BB1MIC|3.0|I was disappointed when I discovered that within my box set I have 2 disk 5 for season 5 and no disk 6.  I returned it to Amazon, received a replacement and still the same problem.  I need to figure out how to fix this without running around in circles
0307276902|5.0|As such an avid reader, I have to say I'm quite impressed by the uproar that this little book about some random guy's drug addiction has caused. As a teenager, I am all too aware of the affect computers, video games, and television are having on my generation and the fact that no one reads anymore! So, if James Frey didn't accomplish anything besides making one of my non-reader friends pick up A Million Little Pieces and realize that it might be kind of cool to read then I am satisfied. I think an author's main goal is to evoke some emotion in their reader. This emotion does not necessarily have to be a happy one, or even one of anger, but I think anything is better than apathy.  <br />For those of you that haven't read the book (maybe you are reading this now to try and decide whether you should order it?) I think you should indeed go buy it, or check it out from the library if you choose, and figure out for yourself what the hype is all about. In a nutshell, James Frey, for one reason or another, became a drug addict. After a horrible accident, he was sent to a detoxification center and given the choice to either get sober, or die. Along his journey, he meets many people that changed his life, including his friends Leonard and Lilly. But when one of these friends (Miles in the book, a judge from Louisiana) happened to call Anderson Cooper 360 to back up his friend's story, he was promptly cut off. Although hard to believe that an account of drug addiction could be beautifully written, it is. The recent developments as to the validity of the story do not change my opinion in this aspect. A Million Little Pieces chronicles Frey's struggle with \\"the Fury\\" inside himself and with the everyday hardships of recovering from addiction. Overall the message is one of hope, and I still believe this a book everyone needs to read.  <br />I can understand Oprah's anger and her feelings that she was \\"duped.\\" But I also lost a little respect for her because at first she said shefully supported James Frey (in her call to Larry King Live) but then later changed her opinion saying that she was betrayed, in an apparent attempt to save her own behind. Also, I didn't like the way she asked intensely personal questions on national television and interrogated Frey like he was a criminal in court, ironically about whether he really went to jail or not.  <br />How many authors can get a class of high school students to have a heated debate about their book? Not many in my opinion. But in English class after all of this was brought to the nation's attention, I witnessed it for myself. I do admit, that after hearing James Frey fabricated parts of his book; I was less impressed by what he apparently went through in his journey to recovery. But at the same time while I am disappointed, I don't feel cheated in any way, and know I read a book that successfully portrayed the difficulty of overcoming an addiction. Most importantly (I'm sure my mom will be glad to hear this) it made me NEVER WANT TO DO DRUGS. I MEAN NEVER.  <br />Whether you think James Frey is a lying you-know-what or the victim of this unfortunate situation, I think that as a story of overcoming addiction it is thoroughly moving and well written. As the book that sparked a million little debates, I think this is ONE memoir (can I still call it that?) that you don't want to miss.  <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a huge SOAD fan, I love every CD of theirs and all of them are 99.9 percent flawless, but this album have many flaws that could've been fixed, so here we go... <br /> <br />1) Attack: A normal SOAD song. Not bad, but not awesome. Like Needles in \\"Toxicity\\". 7/10. Best Part: Well, the chorus is the best part in the whole song. <br /> <br />2) Dreaming: Not a great song, but nevertheless is quite good. 6/10. Best Part: The part where all hell breaks loose, Serj, Daron, and another guy (not sure who) are singing like mad people. <br /> <br />3) Kill Rock'n Roll: One of the good tracks in the album, Daron's vocal parts are awesome here. 9/10.  Best Part: \\"Eat all the grass that you want. Accidents happen in the dark.\\" Just listen to the song. <br /> <br />4) Hypnotize: Excellent solo, great lyrics, and brilliant Daron vocals makes Hypnotize a classic that shouldn't be forgotten. 10/10. Best Part: The solo part.  <br /> <br />5) Stealing Society: Average song that is saved by awesome Daron vocals at the end. 7/10. Best Part: I just said it, the Daron vocals. <br /> <br />6) Tentative: The second best song in the whole album. Sounds like Prison Song in \\"Toxicity\\" with a less darker tone. 10/10. Best Part: Serj's opening lyrics. <br /> <br />7) U-Fig: Awesome and crazy is the only way to describe this song. Serj is a real psychopath here. 10/10. Best Part: The part where Serj is going psycho and screaming, and screaming, and screaming... <br /> <br />8) Holy Mountains: Excellent gem, wonderful solo, good lyrics, kinda reminds me of Iron Man from Black Sabbath. 10/10. Best Part: The guitar part in the beginning.  <br /> <br />9) Vicinity of Obscenety: Craziest song in any SOAD album. Makes you think if Serj was high on drugs when singing this. 10/10. Best Part: The (funny) chorus, \\"BANANNA BANANNA BANANNA BANANNA TERECOTTA BANANNA TERECOTTA TERECOTTA PIE!\\" <br /> <br />10) She's Like Heroin: Totally underrated. It has good guitar use and weird lyrics which makes this a perfect gem. 8/10. Best Part: Some very weird lyrics, \\"Chinese tricks in rooms. With ghosts and hookers, girly dudes.\\" <br /> <br />11) Lonely Day: DAMN! When this album was nearly getting a five! 3/10. Best Part: This song just doesn't work here to have a best part. I can say that the music video of Lonely Day is the best part of the whole song. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />12) Soldier Side: Best track in the whole album, if you hated it, then why don't you try listening to it? 10/10. Best Part: Everything, really. <br />
0316921173|5.0|A friend of mine nixed the hardcopy of this book by shoving it down the front of her shirt. How she ever got it out of there I'll never know--she is quite a big girl up front though, maybe that hepled. She didn't really want to read it but I said that I'd take it for a spin. It is quite long, I'll give the other reviewers that, but for petes sake its not like its a 1200 page behemoth--its only 1088 pages! Come on people, stop whining already--its only got about 389 pages of footnotes as well...in teenyweeny print. It only took me two days to read (I read fast) and it was amazing.<br /><br />It seems like Ms Wallace is warning us of a world that we seem to be fast approaching--especially with all the current (and rampant I might add) mediacal influences on our culture. If we keep going at this rate we will end up with a country very much potrayed in the book. I did like how the years are subsidized and people drive around in cars with advertising on the side and that people are watching a movie that is name of the title of the book. How very Post Modern of You Miss Foster! Haha.<br /><br />The prose is a little speedy, lengthy, scintillating, cascading, back withdrawing and widthdrawing back, and crashing, smashing, dashing, looping and flowing--much like Faulkner, and if you dont like him or William Vollmans work, I don't think that you are going to get very far in this book. Be Warned! If you can stand lengthy and looping prose and love to see someone torture and abuse the english language(not to mention your patience), why then, this book is for you my friend! Don't miss out!<br /><br />I don't want to give away the pot or the ending but by the finish you shouldn't be confused at all. Just think back to his father(referred to as Himself) and it should all fall in place. People say this book is confusing, but it isn't! Just use a little of that brain power you were born with.

B000089770|5.0|\\"Smoke\\" simply is one of the best films I have ever seen! The acting is magnificent, the characters are so incredibly real. But most of all, what I like about this movie is the warmth of the characters. These persons are humans, warm, loving human beings with their hearts at the right place. They are not so sympathetic at first, but as in real life sometimes, as one gets to know them better, they all  of a sudden become one's closest friends. I really was a bit sad when the film was over (and unfortunately the sequel is nowhere as good as this film, although it's a good movie too).<br /><br />So, if you want to know what life is all about, watch this film...
0307276902|1.0|Aside from being a blatant liar, James Frey has done an enormous diservice to himself and the millions of us who are in recovery.  His mockery of the humility and soul searching taught at places like Hazelton doom him to reside in the bardo of dry drunkeness and its consequent misery.  It is not the sellers of this misleading book who should reimburse us readers but rather James Frey himself. And then, if he's serious about being a sane and healthy person on this planet, he should consider checking himself in again.
B00005YXZH|1.0|This seems to get compared to Brian Eno or Pink Floyd an awful lot; the difference between these bands is that there was something new and revelatory in Eno's and Floyd's voyages into abstract sonic territory, whereas Wilco just sounds like five guys making alot of noise.  They aren't talented nor visionary enough to make the trip worthwhile, and by the fifth out-of-key toy piano solo played by producer extrordinaire Jim O'Rourke, or the umpteenth verse of lyrical inanity (\\"I am an American aquarium drinker/I assasin down the avenue\\") you get the sense this is just all some great vanity project undertaken by guys who are just \\"too smart\\" to play the songs straight.  It's a real shame because the YHF demos (available online) and the soundtrack to \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" have shown that the band isn't playing nonsense over nonsense - they're ruining perfectly good songs that might make this one of Wilco's best releases had some less self-indulgent minds been guiding the proceedings.  If you're new to Wilco, check out Being There or Summerteeth first and pretend this never happened.
B00003CX5P|3.0|After Star Wars opened, George Lucas knew he had a hit and started planning two sequels.  After Empire Strikes Back, he started thinking about three prequels and possibly three additional sequels. <br /> <br />The Phantom Menace is the first prequel.  This film is like The Empire Strikes back.  It is here to set up the story.  We meet all the characters talked about in the original trilogy. <br /> <br />Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is a Jedi master whose apprentice is Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  They are escorting Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) when their ship crash lands in on Tatooine.  There they come across a young boy Anakin Skywalker.  Anakin has great skills. Obi Wan sees it and frees the boy as his apprentice. <br /> <br />The rest of the film is used to set up the two films to follow. <br /> <br />The problem with prequels is they are limited in what can happen.  The ending must support the original film.  Therefore, we know what must happen to many of the lead characters.  The plus is that some important scenes that are only referred to can be fully fleshed out. <br /> <br />The failure of this film is that the special effects are more important the story. <br /> <br />This is a beautifully made film but it is like an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.  At the end you are whistling the sets. <br /> <br />Ewan McGregor proves why he is one of the most sought after actors.  He shows many facets to Obi Wan.  The rest of the cast is fine in what they are given. <br /> <br />This is a must own for a Star Wars fanatic, a must see for a Star Wars fan and a must miss for those who prefer films by Kubrick, Kurosawa or Truffaut.  I fit in the second but want the first three because I love the second three. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS -  <br />Disc One: Commentary by George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Ben Burtt, Rob Coleman, John Knoll, Dennis Muren and Scott Squires <br /> <br />Disc Two: <br />Deleted Scenes and Documentaries -  <br />Deleted Scene Documentary: 8 minute documentary on deleted scenes. <br />The Beginning Making Episode I: 1 hour making of documentary. <br />Deleted Scenes Only: 17 minutes of deleted scenes - 7 scenes. <br /> <br />Featurettes, Wed Documentaries and StarWars.com -  <br />Web Documentaries: 12 documentaries that were originally released on StarWars.com.

B00005JNX0|4.0|Marty the Zebra is restless. He feels his age of ten years and wonders what life in the wild would be like. His buddy, Alex the Lion is happy with the status quo. He's the star of Central Park's Zoo, merchandising and all.<br /><br />When Marty gets the bright idea to escape to the wild--in CT--his pals run out to find him. The plan backfires when they get caught and shipped out to Africa.<br /><br />What ensues is a series of part madcap and part philosophical adventure, giving fresh meaning to \\"the grass is greener on the other side.\\" Kids will enjoy the film while learning that the things you wish you had aren't always what you want.<br /><br />The computer animated graphics are nicely done, including a fun, whimsical piece when Alex gets tranquilized at one point.<br /><br />It's not the greatest film ever made, but it certainly is worth getting for kids of kindergarten age and up. Younger children may enjoy it, too, for the animal escapades.<br /><br />-C.W.
B000BTJDGC|2.0|I tried to watch this movie with an open mind. I feel that the origional Exorcist was the most terrifying movie I have ever seen and knew that I shouldn't try to compare the two. This movie not only doesn't live up to William Peter Blattys first movie it doesn't live up to the third one Legion Exorcist III with George C. Scott. Not sure it was even as good as the horrible Heretic or the last two bombs that they did twice cause they stunk.<br /><br />Now to get to Emily Rose. I found this movie to be one thing that a movie based on an exorcism should at least try to be and that is scarey. It wasn't scarey in the least. Not one time. As a court room drama I thought it was boring and blah. If they were going to present this as a court room drama they could have just done that and not passed judgement or had all the hocus pocus mumbo jumbo and let you decide. But they try to make it realistic by having and showing a trial (which I guess did happen in Germany in the real story of a girl with Grand Maul Epileptic Siezures that a bunch of morons convinced themselves was demonic possession and pumped her full of drugs and her haulucinations along with the epilepsy convinced them that she didn't need medical care but a witch doctor priest and they let her starve to death and die of neglect).<br /><br />I thought Laura Linney was boring and Campbell Scott was so ineffective and boring that I didn't even record or recognize him simply cause I didn't care. The movie is just bad and ineffective at what it should be.
0596007124|5.0|I've been programming professionally for a few years now and wanted to get out of bad habits.  I had purchased other design books, but got weighed down by \\"when will I ever use that?\\".  I really wish I had read this book 6 years ago.  Though I have read other programming books cover-to-cover, I really enjoyed this one and learned a lot as well.  Funny, creative, and very educational.  I'll have to buy more head first books in the future.

B0001WTVUW|3.0|In 1983 two films about a nuclear holocaust came out.  The first was Testament.  This was a film about a small town coming to terms with the aftermath of a nuclear attack.  There is no finger pointing, just a human story about loss and survival. <br /> <br />The second was The Day After.  This was a much more graphic movie.  The film was more about blame and special effects.  It was meant to scare the masses.  But a simple truths are more effective than flashy special effects. <br /> <br />This is still a great movie but more as a special effects film with some great performances (Especially, Jason Robards).
B000AXSN5G|4.0|I find it laughable that listeners would be carping that \\"only\\" a half dozen songs out of 10 on Neil Young's new album are great, or that this Neil guy sure has a \\"nasal\\" voice.<br /><br />Well, the only other folks who regularly batted over 500 on their albums were the Holy Musical Trinity of Beatles-Stones-Dylan. (And as to vocals, Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and Van Morrison were never exactly considered to be Placido Domingo, either.)<br /><br />Point is that the newbies have to look beyond the American Idolitry gloss they've been brainwashed by in recent years, and just appreciate Neil's genius at writing songs, and his awesome skill at putting them across.<br /><br />As to the spoiled oldsters, no - there will never be another album the same as Harvest - so get over it.
B000BNX3B4|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. I like John Cusak and usually everything he is in. Diane Lane is also usually reliable. I can't really say that they did a bad job or that Dermot Mulroney was bad either. I liked his character though I thought pretty much right off that he was the \\"too good to be true\\" guy and was going to end up being a cad. Christopher Plummer was excellent and has been in just about everything he is in lately. He is like a fine wine or an untapped treasure that is we are getting the pleasure of seeing in some fine work. But this movie was just your typical 'You've got mail' 'Sleepless in Seattle' stuff. That is not bad cause I liked those movies but this was just nothing special and completely predictable.<br /><br />The best part was the dog. A beautiful big old black furry Newfoundland. His performance was at least a 4 star.
B000BM3ZUE|4.0|Well, according to Gentle Giant's official website ([...]) it's a limited edition remaster of the album done by Repertoire records (Germany). There's also limited editions of this album and \\"Three Friends\\" done in Japan by Vertigo, I think. This is the same kind of remastering job that was done for \\"Octopus\\" in Japan a few years ago (now out of print). GG's official site ranked it as the best remaster for that album.  <br /> <br />By the way you'll find that info on the site, in the news section (on December 15th, if I remember correctly). Hope that helps...
B0007PAMR4|3.0|The above 3-Star rating is for the Alan Smithee extended version due to the weaknesses I will explain.  The also-included David Lynch theatrical release I rate at 5 of 5, one of my favorite movies of all time.    I waited a long time for this release..and I can say I enjoyed it. Certainly not the end-all version and it has it's flaws but it brings some new items to the table to enjoy.    Why is it directed by Alan Smithee? That name is an alias for a Director or group of people who wanted their real name removed.  After the studio re-edited his film, Lynch walked off in a rage refusing to have anything to do with the extended cut, hence the alias.    First off, the Extended Cut has some wonderfully restored footage. The cleaned up footage really allows a lot of detail from the sets, miniatures, and costumes to come forward. This cleared color restoration also improves the view of some of the effects shots. However, this is a double edged sword, as some of the dark Lynchian feel is lost with the brighter colors and detail.    The original score was altered out of necessity due to the lengths of certain scenes changing from the theatrical version. Fans of the Toto score, such as myself, might notice the changes. Though the score is generally intact, there are some moments that the music cresendo does not match the visual cue you might remember. Due to this some of the more powerful moments lost a little of it's emotional impact.    Gone is the Princess Irulan prologue. My feelings on the Extended edition prologue are mixed. The frame zooms in on a cover of a copy of Herberts Dune, which I felt was entirely unecessary. The teacher-like deep voiced narrator explains much of the history behind the story while you see a series of paintings and drawings of both familiar Lynch version sights and known history of the Dune universe. Though I feel this prologue takes away some of the dark and mysterious feelings of the theatrical version, it will add a lot of detail to help those who are not familiar with the books.    I felt there was too much narration.  It was distracting and took away from the mystery.    The narrators voice is used to an interesting effect. Paul uses a film-book to research Arrakis. The voice of the narrator in his film-book is the same as the film narrator. It's as if you are watching a future documentary film-book as the narrator describes key points.    One of the scenes with the most alterations is the opening scene in which the Guild Navigator confronts the Emperor about the plan against House Atreides. This scene was handled poorly by the re-editors. In an attempt to make the dicussion and involved factions easier to understand, they slipped in altered dialogue. When the Emperor refers to 'The Atreides' the world 'The' is replaces by 'Duke' TV-edited bad world style. This happened only a few times in this scene, but was really annoying.    Furthermore, in an attempt to convey travel between a scene transitions, they use footage from other parts of the movie. The original shot of the Baarons ship clearing from a cloud as it approaches Arrakeen is used several times for multiple characters travel transitions. You even see the shot of the Baarons ship approaching the desert city spliced into the Reverend Mother arriving on Caladan the Ocean world. This was really uneeded and distacting...but fortunately it is only used a few times in the 1st act and not again after that.    These are minor gripes compared to something that bothered me more. Two scenes with the Baaron were edited. First the violent and disturbing scene in which he murders a servant after plotting against the Duke is removed. And the shot in which he spits in Jessicas face is also gone. Though not in the book, I really liked how these scenes made the Baaron more of a menacing off-the-hinge mad man.  Also the scene when Paul takes the water-of-life is also changed.  The Lynch only vision of all Bene-Gesserit across the universe bleeding during the event is also gone.    Despite these annoyances that may or may not bother Dune fans, there are lots of scenes to make up for it. Many of these scense add more depth and characterization to Feyd, Dr. Kynes, Thufir, Gurney, and more. Furthermore there are more scenes dealing with the Fremen way of life. One particular scene, in which the Duke seals an aliance with the Fremen by pouring water on the stone floor and the moon is reflected in it, really add to the story.     Here are some of the scenes that have been re-edited or extended in the film:    -The conception of Pauls sister  -Discussions about the Fremen  -The messages between the Baaron and the Duke  -Dr. Kynes meeting the House of Atreides (in which Gurney plays his Balliset)  -The alliance between the Fremen and Atreides  -Pauls duel with the Fremen Jonas, and Jonas' funeral  -The creation of the water of life    Unfortunately one anticipated scene is still absent, the Death of Thufir Hawat.    Because of it's better timing with the soundtrack and darker Lynchian feel of violence, I still prefer the original Lynch Theatrical version of Dune. However this extended cut has a lot to offer to the table for fans of the movie and books.    Extended cuts are there to add detail and information for fans...and hardly ever replace the original version.  This Alan Smithee version is not an exception.
0316096199|5.0|I could not put this novel down from the minute I picked it up. I happened to be in a bookstore, and had read the lovely bones and decided to give this novel a try. One thing I'm curious about is where people got the idea that this novel was fiction (mentioned in reviews). It is a MEMOIR of the author detailing her true life tale. Anyone who has the stomach to read about a detailed rape will be sure to enjoy this book.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|Now, before hearing this album, I would have had no clue who 'The Offspring' were let alone that they were a band. So begins my initiation into 'Americana' the band's 4th album release. And you know what? I like the band. Listening to this band and their songs I had a big grin plastered on my face especially during 'She's Got Issues' - every man can definitely say that in their times they have been with 'women with issues'. Oh boy, I know I have!<br /><br />'Americana' is a really entertaining album with a stunted opening 9 second piece of 'huh?'. They could have begun the album much better and that's why I haven't given this great CD five stars. 'Have You Ever' is a great song and it could be said that this song is a two in one. Another great song is the much well known 'Pretty Fly (For A White Guy), with its anthem tune and make fun of lyrics. Another fine song is 'The End of The Line', another anthem rock beat with a tongue in cheek lyrics that anyone can sing along to.<br /><br />This album is great and entertaining. I look forward to getting more of The Offspring's albums as I am really enjoying this grunge rock band.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I have watched this documentarty several times. I never get tired of it and find it incredibly interesting. Hearing MaNamara tell the story of his life  mixed in with news footage and home movies is just engrossing. From his time in college as a wiz kid and one of the \\"best and the brightest\\" to his time at Ford Motor Company, to his military service in WWII to the Kennedy White House, the Cuban Missle Crisis, Kennedy's assassination and Viet Nam MacNamara pulls no punches and neither does the guy interviewing him. This is not a guy trying to justify his actions or his life. He examines the trials and tribulations, mistakes and accomplishments with the same microscope that he did his job(s). He also is not immune to history and how it has unfolded and how he is perceived.<br /><br />This is an interesting movie and I have and will watch it again and again. It is that compelling.
0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond's 'Collapse' is a whirlwind tour through space and time in an effort to determine what factors have caused the collapse of multiple civilizations and cultures. He looks at modern-day Montana, Easter Island, Norse Greenland and Iceland, the Mayans, Tokugawa Japan and many, many more.<br /><br />Diamond has a small list of factors but basically he determines that in most cases it all comes down to poor resource management (he does acknowledge exceptions such as foreign invasion, but even that may have poor resource management as its basis.)<br /><br />While I did not agree with all of his conclusions, I found this work to be fascinating, well-written and thought-provoking. Well worth my time and the cost of the book.
0446343129|5.0|This interesting and quick read makes a compelling case against sugar, the industrial food establishment and various agencies which support and are supported by it. It may be somewhat one sided but with as much sugar pervasiveness in our food supply and pro-sugar and pro-industrial food propaganda in the media as there is out there I think it's called for. The historical perspective is thought provoking, even if some of it is anecdotal or speculative,  sugar is rarely discussed in terms of history (i.e. in the motives for the colonization, and installation of slave sugar cane plantations in the new world). Overall, if you are trying to give up sugar in its entirety, this book is the one to instill the impetus in you. I do wish William Dufty had studied a bit more of what Dr. Weston Price published in \\"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration\\" which he makes reference to. Dr. Price made important nutritional discoveries in his research in the 1930's of indigenous cultures and their health, which Dufty refers to but does not incorporate into his diet recommendations. One book which I can recommend wholeheartedly which takes a contemporary look at the issues which both Dufty and Price raise is \\"Nourishing Traditions: The cookbook that challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats\\" by Sally Fallon and Mary Enig M.D.. It is a comprehensive cookbook, primer on traditional nutrition and amazing culinary practice. I guarantee it will cut through the haze of diet fads and confirm what your great grandmother knew to be true with good science. But read Dufty's book, and kick your sugar habit!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|After we watched it the first time, we had to watch it again.
B000AP04FG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had some good entertaining action sequences, gun fights and martial arts. Vince Vaughn was his usual motormouth funny self as Brad Pitts sidekick. I liked the concept too. Two spys/assassins from different companies who are living a cover of happily married people with neither knowing the other is what he/she is. I also loved the fact that they were boring, bored repressed married people who when they found out the truth found out they had a lot in common. One of those things being that they got a rush and sexual thrill out of taking out their frustrations on each other while beating the *ell out of each other. And while this is all going on they find that they are more attracted and turned on than they have ever been to one another and that they are secretly soulmates and they didn't even know it.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does his usual good job and adds that little goofey funny stuff that is just hilarious along with his maniacle strange laugh that is just great. Jolie is perfect for the role in that she can play the button up frustrated tight *ss house wife who has the evil, wicked, sex kitten underneath. I heard when this movie came out that Pitt and Jolie had no chemistry. I think that may have been from the overhype by the paparazzi cause I thought they were great together and they seemed to be having a great time making this movie.
6305265488|4.0|For every female who dreamed over the story Cinderella as a girl, this one is for you. Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore) is our heroine. She is a child of eight years when her father tragically dies, leaving her with her stepmother the Baroness, (Anjelica Huston) and two stepsisters, Marguerite and Jacqueline. Danielle becomes a servant, although unlike in most of these tales, she has other servants to help her, and has a close bond with them. Danielle craves her stepmother's love, but is no lilly-hearted maiden. This gal is more like a rose. Soft and beautiful, but watch out boys, she knows how to use those thorns. After her father dies, it's ten years before a new man enters her life. The prince, of course. <br /> <br />Another difference in the story is one of the stepsisters, Jacqueline. Instead of being part of the problem, she offers kindness and basic courtesy to Danielle, and although she's not in any real position to help her step-sister, you can tell it helps. It's a refreshing change, and one get's the feeling that they'll grow to be great friends. <br /> <br />Long story short, in the midst of Danielle's daily life, she meets and falls in love with the prince, Henry, and he returns the sentiment, but one little hitch. He thinks she's a woman of nobility, and she falls further and further into the hole of deception as the relationship evolves.(Dougray Scott is our hero.) This lie later causes problems, and makes a temporary mess of everything. <br /> <br />If you want to know more, see the movie. Everyone delievers a worthy performance but Drew Berrymore and Ms. Huston really knock it out of the ballpark. The Baroness is no one-domensial character. She's cruel occassionally, cold often, but there is one scene where Danielle is brushing her hair where you catch a glimpse of vulneribility from Danielle's stepmother, and how circumstances might have shaped her into what she has become. Danielle's character is just extradionary. She is fiery and passionate, but idealistic and kind at the same time. She's all you could ever want in a heroine. Also, she doesn't try to be the most beautiful woman. Her bratty stepsister is more physically beautiful, but is hallow inside, and it shows. <br /> <br />As for the romance between Danielle and the prince, the chemisty wasn't the best in the world, but the actors do the best they can, and in the end, satisfy. The script is a little modern at times, but not enough to be actually annoying. There isn't enough to actually complain about, and I reccomend this for anybody. Guys might not be crazy about the story, but will probably be happy to gawk at Drew Berrymore, and might enjoy the swordfight. The scenery is just georgeous, so that might help as well.

0425166805|2.0|This is an interesting work,  from a highly discredited author.   While he is a very good storyteller,  once you leave the web of his writing he theories dissolve quickly.  According to his key rational,  all 'primitive' people were stupid - so how else could they have built great wonders but with the help of aliens.   But if our ancestors were so unintelligent,  how did we every progress to where technology is today?   Did the aliens make many repeat visits?  Read this for an interesting look into one man's theories following the boom of space travel,  but then look at the theories for what they are - incredible unsubstantiated.
0684857219|1.0|I am naturally someone who studies my hobbies.  So, when starting out lifting weights, I read the reviews of the Encylcopedia, wrote off the negative reviews as being from losers, and ponied up my cash.    Now, further into my lifting career, I am the proud owner of both the finest source of bodybuilding myth available and a neat tool for killing spiders.    The book looks good, and Arnold's attitude is awesome.  The 'go hard or go home' thing is really great, and appeals to the way I do things in life.    However, the information is junk.  The exercises are not described in nearly enough detail to avoid injury (example, deadlifts), and the exercise programs seem to be designed to overtrain you to the point of failure.    Whilst Arnold was a legend, there are two things to bear in mind:  1) He was a genetic freak.  His body recovers an awful lot faster, and builds muscle better, than your average guy on the street.    2) He was on steroids.  Steroids enable the user to recover a lot faster and build muscle whilst doing practically anything.     As I'm genetically normal and don't plan on risking my health to gain further mass, this means his advice isn't that useful to me.    If you want better sources of information, I recommend the following:    * The books by Stuart McRobert ([...]) are excellent and oriented to years of successful, hard, productive training.  * The web forum [...] is frequented by a lot of highly knowledgeable lifters.  There is far more information and advice available there than available through any book.    I've kept lifting and have been making steady gains.  The Encyclopedia, however, will hinder your progress and waste your money.
1573223026|5.0|Suicide is not a group endeavor. But this it will become if you choose to kill yourself by jumping off the roof of London's most popular suicide spot - Topper's house, on the most popular night for committing suicide - New Year's Eve. This is the predicament of Martin, Maureen, Jess and JJ in Nick Hornby's latest bestseller, A Long Way Down. It is a bold setup, but Hornby pulls it off with understated ease and wit.  <br />Maureen, a naive single mother has no life beyond caring for her severely disabled son. Martin, a television host finds life unlivable after public disgrace and imprisonment for having sex with a 15-year-old girl. Jess, a snotty, uninhibited 18-year-old girl with a politician father and missing sister, is depressed because she cannot track down the boy she likes. JJ, a failed American rocker, is forced to deliver pizza and entertains the delusion that if he leaps with a copy of Richard Yates's ''Revolutionary Road'' in his arms, his death might bring it a wider readership. Bonded by their shared misery, the motley crew of misfits spend the night together, telling their stories and eating cold pizza. As Jess reflects: \\"When you're sad - like, really sad, Toppers' House sad - you only want to be with other people who are sad.\\"  <br />At its core, A Long Way Down isn't really about suicide itself, rather it's about what happens when you realise that you don't have the guts to push yourself off the edge. The tale that subsequently unfolds is an unusual and unpredictable one. The odd quartet coalesces into a kind of surrogate family; each individual takes a halting first step toward creating a tolerable future, while constantly getting on each other's nerves. Hornby alternates adroitly executed comic episodes - a brush with tabloid fame, a group vacation to the Canary Islands, a book group focused on writers who have committed suicide, a disastrous attempt to save Martin's marriage - with interludes of insightful reflections. <br /> Despite his sardonichumour, Hornby is never superficial enough to suggest that these lives that have fallen apart can easily be patched up and renewed. There is no melodrama, no heroism, no magical cures, and no glorious moments of redemption. If, as a result, there's a sort of aimlessness as the book dwindles toward its end, perhaps it is the price Hornby pays in his refusal to offer either cheap, grand or sentimental reasons to choose life. He seems to flounder in the pointlessness of it all. It is almost as though he is fairly certain that life is worth living but can't quite find the ways to prove it.
0812550706|5.0|The story of an enslaved genius, Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, deals with Andrew Wiggin, Ender, and the journey he and his comrades make to save the earth from the alien Buggers.  Set on Earth and a training base satellite, Ender's Game deals with the huge trials of some very small children. <br /> As the story begins, Ender is being monitored to test if he has what it takes to defend the Earth from the attacking buggers.  After Ender proves his merit he is whisked away to begin training at an IF base, battle school, much to the dismay and envy of his older brother, Peter.  Upon his arrival, Ender is outcaste because of his size and his obvious intelligence, but soon they will all bend under his will as their supreme leader.  Ender quickly travels through the ranks of battle school, which is designed to train the hyper intelligent youth to kill and protect Earth.  Along the way, Ender gains the respect and admiration of many, but the hate and envy of many more.  As Ender transcends far above his fellow classmates he becomes even more lonely and isolated than ever before.  Pushed to his limits, Ender surpasses anything that the world has seen and becomes a machine of strategy and command.  The buggers are defeated, but how?  And at what price? <br /> Throughout his novel, Card does an excellent job of making the children in his novel seem so much more than mere children.  Their teachers push them far beyond what any person today could expect and their language, actions, and thoughts reflect that.  But Card also portrays this training as the jail that it really is, as seen in this quote from Valentine, Ender's sister, \\"Welcome to the human race.  Nobody controls his own life, Ender.  The best you can do is to be controlled by good people, by people who love you.\\"  Card obviously wants to convey the feeling of isolation and control that the truly gifted feel.  The children in battle school are told what to do with their amazing gifts, and often times feel that they are the prisoners of society.  Colonel Graft portrays this mentality that the gifted are only there to be used with this quote, \\"Individual human beings are all tools, that the others use to help us all survive.\\"  The general language in the book is easy to read and understand and is not verbose at all.  No word is wasted in Card's novel, which helps to further push the idea that the children in the book have become machines, nothing wasted or unneeded.  As a writer and intelligent person himself, I think that card uses the story of Ender to not only tell a wonderful story, but to express how he has occasionally felt; trapper inside the own workings of his mind. <br /> The appeal of Ender's Game is hard to explain. One of my personal thoughts is that people who love the book can really identify with Ender. I feel that anyone can pick up Ender's Game and thoroughly enjoy it for what it is, an excellently told story with wonderful character development.  But the reader that can identify with some of the feelings that Ender and the other battle school children face will become engrossed in the development and success of each and every child.  We all have dreamt of becoming an astronaut and fighting aliens at one point, and Card takes it to that level, but with children as the warriors.  As a teenager it is much easier to relate to another child than a war hardened space traveler in his mid thirties. <br /> Card writes an excellent book with a superb storyline.  The character development will leave your grasping for not only breath, but the next page, and the look into the mind of a genius is amazingly intriguing.  I would definitely recommend Ender's Game to science fiction fans, and any other reader that is looking for an absolutely engrossing adventure.  <br />

Never again will you want to take your child/children to a circus. <br /> <br />Although i must confess, i did enjoy the book far better than the film, but how many of u could actually picture Tim Curry in your heads as Pennywise?

1573225517|5.0|Nick Hornby's writings (About a boy, High fidelity, How to be good, A long way down etc) are classic takes on modern-day relationships that we often label as love, thereby casting useful insights into the minds of characters that any reader can instantly relate to. Well, not any reader. But if you - <br />1. Are living a life that's chaotic, boring and confusing all at once <br />2. Are facing dilemmas about love, sex, compatibility, fidelity etc. <br />3. Love your parents but can't live with them <br />4. Love your partner but can't live with him/her <br />5. Are tired of being single, but afraid to let go of the supposed joys of singledom <br />- then, High Fidelity is a tale that'll have you go, \\"Hey, I've been there!\\"  <br />Why am I making a list, you might ask. I'm making a list, a top five list actually, because High Fidelity is a novel that's full of lists, albeit more interesting than this one - top five most memorable split-ups, top five Cheers episodes, top five Elvis Costello songs, etc), so I figured, why not set the mood?  <br />This witty and emotionally story is narrated by Rob, an early-thirty-something English guy who runs a record store in a far-out London suburb. He sells albums recorded the old-fashioned way - on vinyl - and is having a tough time making other transitions as well, specifically to adulthood. After his live-in girlfriend, Laura, leaves him for another man, he realizes that he pines not for sexual ecstasy but for the monogamy he's cynically has come to think of as a crime. He takes comfort in the company of the clerks at his store and of a touring singer, Marie La Salle, who is \\"unpretentious and pretty in that nearly cross-eyed American way.\\" But Rob's life becomes more complicated when he encounters Laura again, and hence unfolds a tale of the trials of fidelity, both mental and actual. <br />Music is a continuous sub-plot in the narrative, like an Air record playing in a background - serene but impossible to ignore. Is it a love story? It can be; if Rob ever realizes what \\"love\\" actually embodies. But at the very least, it is a story about the clash between seeking companionship and fearing the loss of individual identity.
068987474X|5.0|When I was 13, I had my first boyfriend. Well, sort of. What I really had was a boy sitting in the desk behind mine in math class, whispering fairly perverted things to me rather than 'sweet nothings'. I interpreted this as the beginning of my desirability to men and proceeded to do all kinds of stupid things to keep this boy's attention... all of which I later regretted. It was the first of what would be roughly 25 years of bad relationships choices with emotionally unavailable men.<br /><br />In other words, men who \\"just weren't into me\\". When I read Greg and Liz's book, not only did I laugh (a LOT) but I instantly recognized how valuable it would have been to have had these insights much earlier in my life. Had I had someone like the authors around to set me straight and make me realize that when a man isn't giving me what I need in the relationship, I would have known that it's NOT a negative reflection on me at all when a man isn't \\"into me\\" enough to be emotionally on the same page I am. It doesn't mean I'M not worth the effort, it means HE's not MAKING the effort whether I'm worth it or not.<br /><br />I could have spared myself years of beating myself up and the \\"why, oh, why\\" syndrome. Now I'm in my 40's and yes, still single*, but totally OK with it. And now when I meet a man and it's not going the way I would like, it's a lot easier to step back or step away, and focus on doing what I need to do to make myself happy in life.<br /><br />And in the meantime I am giving my 13-year-old niece this book. Although parts of it might be a bit too \\"mature\\" for a teen, I think she can handle it and the general message is too important for me not to share it with her. If you are in the dating scene yourself or if you have a young lady in your life who is just beginning to date, GET THIS BOOK! You'll thank me later.<br /><br />*(Update October 2009: Not long after I reviewed this book, I moved to France to pursue my own interests, not to find a man. Eleven months later, I found one anyway, and I knew he was 100% into me from the moment we made eye contact. That was two years ago; we got married a year ago July and now I live with him and his 3 great kids here in Paris, France! Thus proving that when you stop wasting your time with losers who don't appreciate you -- I met a few of those in Paris, too, and made short work of them -- you'll eventually be found by the ONE person who can treat you the way you deserve to be treated.

0517053616|4.0|Many reviews below fault this edition for its complete lack of footnotes, indications of what text was used, or any other background material of any kind.  They have a point, but I still disagree with their criticism.  The edition's lack of these materials does not render it useless.  On the contrary.  I own several Shakespeare editions (among them Bevington, Riverside, and most of the Ardens), and I have used them to study the works in depth.  For me, this edition fills a real need: direct, unmediated access to the text analogous to hearing it read out loud.  Having the Bard's complete output in one physically manageable volume (the Riverside is much too big - try putting it in your briefcase to read on the train!) unencumbered by any extraneous writing such as footnotes allows me to focus completely on the text and avoid getting distracted by the footnotes.  Reading Shakespeare from this book has really changed my perspective on many of the plays because I can enjoy the uninterrupted flow of the narrative, similar to a reading out loud.  One might object that I could simply skip the footnotes of the other editions.  But it's not that simple.  By their very presence, footnotes have, in my view at least, something disempowering.  It's not me encountering the text; rather, it's me respectfully approaching something of which I'm not quite worthy.  That's a fine attitude, and I'm all for it when you get to know the plays.  But having dug through them, I find it a wonderful experience to encounter the \\"pure\\" text (I know that's ultimately an illusion) and enjoy it without someone trying to teach at the same time.  If there's a textual crux or a term I can't understand or some historical background I want to brush up on, I can always look it up in one of my annotated editions.  This edition, by its very simplicity, has really rekindled my enthusiasm for Shakespeare.  Last but not least, having all of Shakespeare's texts in one small volume allows me to flip quickly to another play to look something up or spot cross-connections.  That can be very interesting.  In short, this admittedly simple and perhaps not completely reliable edition has truly enriched my reading of Shakespeare.other play to look something up or spot cross-connections.  That can be very interesting.  In short, this admittedly simple and perhaps not completely reliable edition has truly enriched my reading of Shakespeare.
B0001VWP8I|4.0|I found this new CD to be quite a reversal of her previous 2 cd's.  Not the pumping dance beat I'd come to expect from her (and prefer) but it's got more heart, and I love \\"Welcome to my Truth\\", \\"Sick and Tired\\", and \\"Left Outside Alone\\".

B00008IAMD|5.0|This album is an absolute treasure. It is the most moving album I have ever heard. I lost my own father in March of 2005 and Johnny Cash has always reminded me of my Dad in his outlook and philosophy of life, as well as many of his \\"hurts.\\" Listening to Johnny Cash, many of his albums, and especially this one, has really comforted me in my tremendous grief over my father's passing. I can't really explain why, but I suppose the oh-so poignant messages that he gives to my mind and heart about life and mortality, help me to cope with my deep heartache. I suppose he sings of heartache is such a beautiful incredibly human way that it speaks to my heart in such a way as to help to heal me. Thank you so much Johnny Cash for sharing your heart, helping to heal my broken heart, and my very deepest sympathies to your family for their loss.
1400032717|2.0|While in college, I also worked with children with Autistism.  This review is by no means intended to offend the Autistic community.  I understand what the author is trying to accomplish with this book (to obviously be unique in a competative world of thousands of writers), but this is not what I define art and literature to be.  The story on its own could definitely be beautiful, but why fill it with rubbish (i.e., pages and pages of drawings, maps, math equations, etc.)  to try to be different?  In my opinion, it's easier to write like Haddon does- it's more difficult to write with a subtle beauty.  Most importantly, great art can withstand time.  Do you honestly think this pop-novel will be read a hundred years from now?

B000BKJ78U|1.0|I love Star Wars. Not \\"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\\", but just Star Wars. And the Empire Strikes Back is even better. This is an awesome movie trilogy, as we all know. It is great to have it on DVD.  <br /> <br />But I, like most other fans it would seem, do not like the intrusive nature of some of the digitally rendered add-ons in these movies. The most infamous of which is the insertion of a young Hayden Christensen to take the place of Anakin's ghost. (You know - from back when Anakin Skywalker was a member of N'Sync?) It's more than a little disconcerting. <br /> <br />George Lucas has definitely gone off the deep end. He keeps blabbering on and on about how now that he has the technology, he is just remaking these movies into what he wanted them to be before the technology existed. Yadda yadda yadda... whatever. Personally, I think he is full of crap myself. (But maybe that's just me.) <br /> <br />I seriously doubt that when George Lucas was making Star Wars, he was thinking, \\"Geez you know this Han Solo guy is really too much of a bad-a__. I think I would rather have Greedo shoot first, but I just don't have the technology to make that look realistic.\\" or \\"Much as I would like to show Anakin's ghost being a hot young hunk, I don't have the technology to do that. So I think I'll use this old geezer instead.\\" GET REAL! <br /> <br />The simple truth is that Old Georgie just can't stop messing with his movies. He's like a person addicted to plastic surgery. He keeps seeing flaws where there are none. He doesn't know when to leave well-enough alone, and the result is something that really tees off at least 50% (probably more) of his fans. <br /> <br />And that's something else that really rankles: Lucas' Hypocrisy. I have heard him repeatedly state that he just makes movies \\"for the fans.\\" That he \\"just wants to make fun movies that people like.\\" But simply put, that's a lie. He doesn't listen to his fans. He doesn't give us what we want. He simply does not care.  <br /> <br />And why should he? After all, they're his movies and he is making them the way he wants them to be, right? Well that's fine. I don't have a problem with that. But if he is serious about pleasing the fans, why doesn't he give the fans what he wants? He's a hypocrite. <br /> <br />\\"But we wouldn't even have Star Wars without George Lucas!\\", the fanboys say. Sure. That's true. But that doesn't mean that I don't have the right to still feel irked when he jerks the movies I REMEMBER out from under me. <br /> <br />\\"But they're his movies and he has the right to make them however he wants!\\", the fanboys say repeatedly. Again, I have no problem with that. But what people REALLY mean when they tell you that is \\"You just need to shut up.\\" I'm sorry, but I won't shut up. I won't shut up until George Lucas gives his real fans what they want.  <br /> <br />Maybe they'll release the real movies on DVD someday 100 years from now after Lucas has been dead for a while. That might be the only way we will ever get it. But knowing him, he'll probably stick it in his will that \\"No One Will Ever Mess With My Movies.\\" Sure. I'm hanging on to my old VHS tapes, myself. At least he can't take those away from me (yet!).
B00009V7P8|5.0|I positively love Damien Rice's \\"O.\\" The album is every-bit as beautiful and haunting as their live performance - which, I might add, took my breath away. Lisa Hannigan's voice is lilting and clear - I could listen to her sing all day long. (I keep waiting for the day when she releases a solo album.) The entire playlist is great, but tracks such as \\"Volcano,\\" \\"Cannonball,\\" and particularly \\"Cold Water\\" are original, raw and overflowing with emotion. I've had the album for more than two years now and it remains one of my all-time favorites.

B00003CXCT|4.0|Talk about Special Features! The Bonus Disc here is awesome. At long last, we finally have the Star Wars Holiday Special on DVD! I have been waiting for this moment all my life.    The only reason that I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the Special Edition features that Lucas included in the Holiday Special. I know it is his Holiday Special and everything, but it was still a little bit disconcerting. Here is a list of all the special features that were digitally added. As you can see, some of them work okay and some of them don't quite work so well:    1. Lucas changed the original 1978 format from full-screen to widescreen by digitally adding in content on the edges of the screen. This works okay for the most part, but I found it kind of distracting to see so many computer-generated ships shooting at each other in the background. It was kind of like watching a video game in that regard.    2. As you know, Boba Fett appears for the first time in the quadrilogy during the SW Holiday Special as a cartoon character. (Yes, it IS a quadrilogy. I include the Star Wars Holiday Special. Empire Strikes Back is actually the 3rd movie.) So it felt kind of strange to me when Lucas went back and changed the original voice in the cartoon to have that rather outlandish New Zealand accent. But what the hey, that's no big deal.    3. We all remember Chewie's relatives Itchy and Lumpy. You know, the two Wookies who he goes to visit on Life Day? But the strange thing was on this new Special Edition how George Lucas chose to digitally add in Itchy's friend Scratchy. I mean, I can't really see the Wookies having a cat in their house, let alone a cartoon one. I mean, that just stretches the limits of credibility, even for the space fantasy genre.    4. Probably the oddest thing was how George Lucas chose to change the hugging scene. Instead of Han Solo hugging the Wookies first, the scene has been changed so that the Wookies hug Han first, and he just hugs back. I thought that this change was totally unnecessary. It substantially changed Han's character in my opinion. I wish Lucas had just left well-enough alone on this one.    5. Still, I enjoyed seeing Leia sing. That is a high point in the show. It still stays with the 70's variety-hour theme. (Which is what good TV is all about, as everybody knows.) So that is a good thing. But it was somewhat \\"jarring\\" (no pun intended) to see Jar-Jar Binks digitally imposed next to Leia, with the music changed so that the two of them are now singing a duet. Personally, I preferred the show just having Carrie Fisher singing on her own.    In conclusion, I would rather have not had all the \\"Special\\" add-ons in the Holiday Special, but the bottom line is that it is George Lucas' movie and he has the right to change it however he wants. I am just thankful to him for allowing us to share in his dream (particularly his Life-Day Dream). What vision the man has!    --------------    P.S. This article was intended for amusement only. No one was hurt in the making of this review and no one should be hurt in the reading of it. In truth, there is no Holiday Special on the bonus disc of this DVD. But alas... we can all still hope, can't we? Maybe someday...
0618001905|5.0|This is the final line from Mr. Kurtz in the book \\"Heart of Darkness\\".  Taking place in the African Congo pre-WWII, this book only touches upon the evil that actually transpired in this region of the world.  A better, and more comprehensive account is given here in King Leopold's Ghost; one of the more heart-wrenching books about the effects of colonialism.       Starting in the late 1800s, the book gives a background of the Scramble for Africa, and how various European nations staked out regions of the continent for their own abuse.  Belgium was late to the game, but they joined with a vengeance under the secret leadership of King Leopold.  Working with others like Dr. Robert Livingstone, Leopold's agents came to carve out an area in Central Africa around the Congo River.  Within this territory, Leopold's agents would enslave and annihilate millions of locals from 1880 to 1940 in the pursuit of ivory and rubber; two globally treasured items that were in abundance here.      The book describes how Leopold established control over this region of the world, the tactics his soldiers used to establish and retain control over the locals, and the effects it had on the various African tribes living in the Congo.  Statistical data kept by the Belgians are used as source material, and the picture they portray is of mass genocide.  Several thousand Belgian soldiers and mercenaries used modern firepower to kill and maim ten million plus local Africans over a period of 50 years.  This book lays it all out in gruesome detail, with pictures to boot.  The latter include pictures of Africans with their hands cut of as punishment for not collecting enough ivory per week.      The book does not end with the Belgians though.  After WWII, the wave of nationalism that swept thru the Third World reached the Congo also.  In the 1950s, the new Republic of Congo declared independence and elected its very own president, Patrice Lumumba.  Mr. Lumumba was not too appreciative of the treatmenthis country had received from the Belgians over the past century, and made it clear in his inaugaral address.  The remaining Belgians took offense and refused to leave.  Mr. Lumumba asked the UN for help.  When this was not forthcoming, he asked the USSR, who agreed to help.  To pre-empt any Soviet intrusion into the Congo region, the US CIA had Mr. Lumumba assassinated and installed their own puppet over the region.  One brisk day for democracy quickly turned into decades of an American-backed dictatorship that kept the people poor and oppressed.     Overall, the story told in this book is well-referenced throughout, and casts a dark shadow over the history of human rights, the Cold War, and America's actions toward the world.  I highly recommend this book.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Many films try to be the next Oscar contender. It's almost as if a director who wants one decides \\"I'm gonna do a period piece with a love story and stuff\\". That was the feeling I got from Cold Mountain, a would-be Oscar contender if it wasn't for the basic idea of the film and also it plays out like \\"and the next cameo is...\\". While it's not a bad film, it's definately something that could've been something better. <br /> <br />The film centers around 2 main stories, 2nd of which comes later. Inman is a soldier in the Civil War who had an incredibly brief romantic encounter with Ada. Getting wounded, he breaks from the hospital and tries to get back to her, meanwhile being hunted for deserting the war since you're supposed to fight in it. Ada strikes a friendship with Ruby who turns Ada's failing farm around. And there you have it: a journey movie with new people on one hand, and a girl buddy movie on the other. <br /> <br />It's quite a credibility stretch even with powers of love. At one point, Inman runs into a single mother and there is that option to stay with her yet he goes off to Ada. Why? They really only shared one kiss. We have to basically agree that these 2 were meant for each other and that's the end of it. I wouldn't go that far. At least films like Titanic and other romantic movies have the person gradually falling for them, not in a split second. <br /> <br />I wasn't kidding when I said \\"name that cameo\\". We have Donald Sutherland, Jena Malone, resident Paul Thomas Anderson repeats Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Waters, Giovanni Ribisi, Brendan Gleeson, even Jack White of the White Stripes is here and surprisingly he's not that bad. Of course the standout is the single mom played by Natalie Portman. Great at playing that willing to support herself and protect her baby but also just needing someone. Just too bad she drops out just like everyone else. <br /> <br />Unlike the overlong English Patient, Cold Mountain in a way deserves its lengths.Lot of bases to cover and the extra time allows the characters to develop. It's just too bad characters drop out as fast as they introduce them, one of which literally doesn't last 2-3 minutes. Most of the time we don't even know their names it's just \\"hey can I walk with you? Blargh, I'm dead\\" and on to the next one. So it's just like the film itself: we're supposed to care about the epic war and love story setting yet it feels kind of hollow.  It's like \\"oh we were supposed to cry and be moved? I didn't know that\\". <br /> <br />Where the film shines is the main leads. Each actor is more than capable in their part with Renee Zellweger ending up winning the Oscar which I can understand although her accent can grate at times. But for some reason casting really attractive people and having them all scarred and muddy seems out of their range oddly. As if they don't belong in that dirty war savaged world which isn't their fault really. Natalie is an attractive actress but seeing her in dirty rags or in a red carpet dress isn't distracting. <br /> <br />A football jock tries to win the college dean's daughter so he pretends to be debonair and \\"James Bond\\"-esque but we know the truth. Similar is Cold Mountain, a good film but no Oscar winner here. <br />
0307276902|4.0|I believe that it is beside the fact that this author made up some parts of this story. The overall theme does not change, and in no way has it changed my mind about this book. A great story, that should be shared with everyone.
B00006D295|5.0|If one were to ask a film critic what they consider to be the greatest movie ever made, \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" would most likely not be a popular answer. If you look at this madcap rock 'n' roll musical from a purely cinematic point of view, it's easy to understand why: an amateurish attempt at a story, less than stellar performances, virtually nonexistent production values, and some of the cheapest special effects ever captured on film (even for the year 1975). When caught up in technicalities and a longing for mainstream purity, then one would have a perfectly good argument for \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" being one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br />But if one were to ask a fan of the film why they love it so much, I guarantee you that their reason has nothing to do with production values or mainstream desirability. Quite the opposite--it's a film that's shunned by most audiences. This hasn't stopped it from becoming one of the most successful cult films ever made, grossing to date over $100 million (this is over a thirty year period, mind you; it's initial release was a disaster). This is because \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" is not just a motion picture. It's a pure social and cultural experience, one that has liberated numerous people labeled by society as \\"misfits\\" or \\"outcasts\\" with its message of, \\"Don't dream it, be it.\\"  <br /> <br />It's also a ritual that warrants midnight gatherings on Fridays and Saturdays dressed as one of the film's characters. The fun is enhanced through the use of props (such as rice, water pistols, and toilet paper, all of which are used on cue) as well as by the act of shouting vulgar lines back to the screen. This trend of audience participation has remained a staple in \\"Rocky Horror\\"'s successful history and only adds to its appeal. Can you imagine how uninteresting it would be to view this film in the privacy of your own home?    <br /> <br />Above all else, it's an opportunity to have fun, allowing for(and often encouraging) the release of the party animal within us all. Only at a \\"Rocky Horror\\" showing would no one blink when seeing an audience decked out in fishnet stockings, glittering corsets, and pasty makeup plastered on their faces. Everyone is uninhibited and no one cares what others may think. What a great excuse for a year round Halloween party. <br /> <br />\\"Rocky Horror\\" is also about the music, with some of the most classic songs ever recorded, including the show stopping \\"Sweet Transvestite,\\" the delightfully sappy \\"Dammit Janet,\\" and \\"The Time Warp,\\" the film's signature song (which prompts the audience to get up and dance along with it). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the very fabric of the film's greatness depends on the music. And why not? The oddball mix of science fiction, horror, sex, and comedy just aren't enough; all that can be seen in plenty of other cult films. Give us something more, something that would leave a lasting impression on the ones who took the time to see what this movie was all about. Through music, \\"Rocky Horror\\" does that, and does that well. <br /> <br />Of all the performances in this film, Tim Curry as the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter is the most memorable. His decadence and sexual overdrive hits us like a ton of bricks and never lets up. (And who really wants it to?) In the tradition of Frankenstein's Monster (who has just come out of the closet), Frank actually creates a muscle man named Rocky for the sole purpose of \\"relieving his tension.\\" The Middle American, wholesome young couple Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) couldn't be more out of place in the world Frank lives in, which makes the situation they're in all the more entertaining. Things only get weirder when you throw in a houseful of servants with quirks of their own, such as hunchbacked butler, a voyeuristic maid, and a tap dancing groupie. Top that off with the film's sinfully twisted story about the night that Brad and Janet spend in Frank's castle, and you have all the ingredients for a cult classic.  <br /> <br />Like such offbeat films as \\"Forbidden Zone\\" and \\"Pink Flamingos,\\" \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" is a film that is experienced, not seen. From its humble beginnings as a London stage play to the creation (and initial failure) of the movie we all know today, \\"Rocky Horror\\" has given story creator and Riff Raff portrayer Richard O'Brien a godlike status among fans. The film is pure camp from start to finish: fun, cheesy, and entertaining. Whether you've seen it 1,000 times (some have actually seen it more than that) or are seeing it for the first time (which would label you as a \\"virgin\\"), it remains to this day a very unique piece of celluloid history.  <br /> <br />Well, what are you waiting for? Pop in the DVD. Don your garter belt, spiked heels, and party hat. Get your water pistols, newspapers, and lighters. And above all else, let's do the Time Warp again!
0440180295|1.0|Slaughterhouse-Five is one of those rare sorts of books whose total lack of any merit whatsoever is inexplicable in the face of its generally agreed upon status as a world classic.    Had this fatalistic, dewy-eyed tripe not been written during the escalation of 'Nam and the sudden moral ambiguity pervading American letters at the time, it would, honestly, never have made it close.    This is sad. The literati have doubtless showered numerous accolades at its feet, though what, for instance, is there to celebrate in this pure dreck?    Vonnegut's cheap cynicism? The novel itself, when not drowning in a sea of depression and cathartic murkiness, hardly makes a joke worth mentioning that doesn't revile the establishment, turn the hardship of soldiers into a complete and utter disgrace, revile all war, and then have the sheer scholastic arrogance to proclaim once and for all, as though this distorted face were really truth. Yes, as a 'satire', it fails completely.    So we come down to technique. The structure of the novel is mildly interesting, and the minimalism flows well. The writing is fairly clear and potentially charged; if only the subject matter had been improved upon, than perhaps the author could have gotten away with the awards. As such, this is hardly the case.    In short, it's nothing groundbreaking. And moreover it is dangerous. Not to mention very worthless. Had it been a great absurdist parable like Catch 22 (which, though also wrong, has strong artistic license, and will likely stand the ages) than I would have rather different sentiments.    1 star.
0143036556|3.0|Jared Diamond is too good a scientist to write a bad book, but this book is disappointing. It is not just that it fails to meet the high standards set by Diamond in Guns, Germs and Steel (indeed, that book is such a masterpiece, it would not be fair to compare them). Rather, what 'dooms' this book to some extent is the often self-important/self-satisfied tone set by the UCLA professor and his groupie students. Diamond is resting on his laurels, rather than on the hard research and stone-cold analysis that marked his previous books. Collapse does have its moments, particularly the chapter on Easter Island, which is probably worth the cost of the book (particularly the paperback edition). But Diamond's set of variables for why societies collapse reads more like a laundry list than a piece of scholarship. Finally, and sadly, the writing is often dull and overly self-referential. One gets the feeling that it was completed in order to reach a publisher's deadline, rather than when the work had been fully completed. Nonetheless, this book makes much better reading than the post-modern garbage and self-serving political activism that characterizes much of social science work today. In particular, the book challenges the notion that indigenous, non-capitalist societies were always in harmony with nature.
0743454537|1.0|I have read books before that I would term \\"bad\\", but I have never read a book that I honestly regreted reading, until this book. The first 400 pages were amazing- wonderfully writen and so adictive I didn't want to stop reading. Then I got to the end. To say it was a let down would be far too mild a description. It wasn't that the ending was upsetting, it was that it made the rest of the book pointless. I won't go into details, (to avoid ruining it for anyone still compelled to read it) but the ending was just so horrible that it is difficult to even fathom. Tragic endings are fine, but this ending really made me wonder how the author could waste her time with the first 400 pages if she was planning to end it how she did. I simply cannot express how much I dislike this book because of how it ended. I have never read one of Jodi Picoult's books before, and my Sister's Keeper has convinced me that I never should have picked up one of her books in the first place.
B00007G1ZC|4.0|Akira Kurosawa's dream sequence of eight short vignettes (most don't feel very dream-like), just about all of them concerned with man's destructive tendencies regarding nature and war: two of them have to do with nuclear accidents, one with the absurdity of war, another with the destruction of a peach orchard, another with a rural Shangri-La. It's a message movie that comes across as a tongue-lashing of our evil ways. The photography is stunning, but the stories themselves are lacking in narrative force. Like all sermons the movie is based on a text, but in this case the text is a bit mundane and cliche-ridden. A rare misfire by the great director.
B0008ISM40|5.0|First of all, I should say that I loved every NIN album until The Fragile showed up, and then I was disappointed.  So know that this review comes from someone who didn't like the thrash sound that Trent was moving into on the previous album.  I first fell in love with NIN for Trent's way of combining melody with electronic and industrial sound; most bands who try to do so veer to far to one extreme or the other, and I felt that The Fragile was more interested in making noise than music. <br /> <br />That said, With Teeth was a very pleasant surprise. Much of the sound on this album makes me think of tracks on Pretty Hate Machine (and that being my favorite NIN album, that made me happy).  In particular, Only, Every Day is Exactly the Same, and Beside You in Time.  Right Where It Belongs is tailor-made for those of us who absolutely loved the simple beauty of A Warm Place on The Downward Spiral; this is a different song, but right in the same vein, and with words now.  Two or three tracks didn't do much for me on this album, but I figure if that's my only complaint there's not much to complain about. <br /> <br />Trent is not going backward with this album, but, fortunately for fans like me, neither is he going forward into the mindless, amelodic thrash all-guiter-and-drums nightmare that has become most hard rock these days.  He retains the things that make NIN NIN; beautiful melody underlying a very hard sound, and great lyrics for those of us who like hearing all the ugliness of the world exposed in song.  (For that moron on here who compared Trent's lyrics to high school poetry...why don't you go back to listening to Nickelback or some similarly useless band, as NIN is way beyond you).   <br /> <br />I highly recommend to all NIN fans, but particularly those who liked the first three albums.  Best.
B000CNDIZE|4.0|Everyone is comapring her to Dido and Jem, but I don't hear it.  She actually sounds more like Mazzy Star and Tori Amos.  The best songs on this album are Sunday, Breath Me, and Don't Bring Me Down. The one that no one is talking about that is the best song on the album is Moon. Her songs are great to make out to or just mellow out.
0307276902|4.0|James Frey's memoir is an insightful look at the long treacherous path of addiction.  Although this book's authenticity has been questioned recently, I still believe it is a great story of the triumph from the path of destruction.  Frey first presents himself when he is at rock bottom; the journey begins on a plane going to Chicago.  He wakes up and has no idea where he is or how he got there.  The first vivid description of his physical appearance is, \\"My front four teeth are gone, I have a hole in my cheek, my nose is broken and my eyes are swollen nearly shut.\\" Although Frey does not ask for pity, the reader cannot help but feel sorry for him.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that is ruthless and encouraging at the same time.  Personally, I find it makes Frey's story so much more meaningful to read about all of the trauma he so vividly describes knowing that he went through some sort of the same events.   <br /> One thing that I found very moving throughout this book is the self destructive nature of James Frey and the other patients at the drug rehab facility.  Frey illustrates self destructive behavior such as physically harming himself and refusing love from the rehab staff and family.  He refuses love because he does not think he deserves it; the emotional reunion with his parents when he finally realized he needed them brought tears to my eyes.  One particular quote I found that shows his physical destructive behavior is \\"I claw at my skin, tear at my hair, start biting myself.\\" Frey wants to hurt himself because he feels so bad about the turn his life has taken.  One other side effect of  low self confidence is Frey not being able to look himself in the eye.  Some of the other characters, such as Lilly, the girl Frey is in love with, and Leonard, his best friend, also exhibit this kind of behavior.  It is mentioned in the book that Lilly slits her wrists at one point and eventually commits suicide.  Frey cannot catch a break; when he finally finds a meaningful relationship it gets taken away from him. What I drew from this aspect of the story is that drugs lead a person to have really low self esteem and may eventually destroy them.   <br /> Although the path of addiction is a dead end, all hope is not lost.  That is what I love about this novel; it shows people who have given up hope they can overcome anything.  Frey has done a wonderful job telling his story.  His writing style is a major factor on the overall tone of the book.  His stream of conscience dialogue flows throughout the book to show his surreal state.  I think this book is also a vital read for teenagers, because it will prevent them from making dangerous decisions and messing around with drugs.  It provides just enough of a taste of the horrible reality of addiction to leave a lasting impression.  <br />
B000005HLV|5.0|This is the best black metal album, period. Superb, brutal and dark.  <br />Hellhammer is the best drummer in the world, The guitar of Euronymous is perfect in \\"life eternal\\", the bass of Grishnack is very cold and have an incredible rythm, Attila's voice is great in special in \\"funeral fog\\" . <br />This CD is just amazing, a must have for any black metal fan !!!
B000003C5C|5.0|I've just revisited this album for the first time in 16 years since I got it on cd format now. It still holds up. I can't say that for most of my death metal collection of yore.  It's common after an artist passes to review their work with an extra benefit of the doubt. However, Chuck Shuldiner's genius is undeniable.  His riffs are tasty and catchy. No filler on this album.  I've always appreciated a vocalist who doesn't sacrifice articulation for brutality. You can have both.  The hooks on this album are almost danceable yet never cheesy or tacky.  This is a credit to the drummer, Bill Andrews. He uses almost a disco technique with the hi hat on Open Casket that's very effective and inventive for its time. Otherwise his strength is knowing when to get out of the way and service the song.  Death didn't try to cram as many notes as they could into every song.  They were masters at setting up riffs with contrasting picking speeds on the build up. The title track exhibits this point and is probably the best death metal song I've ever heard.
B00008YJH5|5.0|This is not a review of this great album, but rather a note to K. Smoot \\"music afficionado\\" about how to speak proper English. When referring to certain bands with nouns as names, especially when the noun is plural and proper, it is necessary to use the word \\"the\\" before them. When I say the sentence \\"I saw the Eagles play against the Jets last month,\\" I use \\"the\\" because it's necessary with the team name. Since \\"Eagles\\" is a team name and \\"I saw Eagles play a football game\\" wouldn't fit the message you're trying to get across, the \\"the\\" is necessary to avoid making a mistake with what the actual subject of the sentence is. If you want to criticize people for their use of the English language, learn how to use it yourself first. <br /> <br />If you still don't believe me, this text was taken from the Pixies' very own website: \\"The Pixies earned themselves a following and by the fall were asked to open for the Boston band, Throwing Muses. The tour got them noticed by producer Gary Smith, who agreed to record the band. The Pixies created an 18-song demo, titled The Purple Tape, which was released to key players within the Boston and international music scene. Shortly after, the band was signed to England's 4AD Records and released the EP Come On Pilgrim in 1987.\\"
B000000OQY|5.0|God, there's so much good about this album. First of all, the previously unattainable \\"Live ?!*@ Like A Suicide\\" is on here, which really shows longtime fans how GNR was back in the day.  You can really understand what these guys were going through as they talk about life in the city. \\"One In A Million\\", while controversial, is one of the best lyrical musical composures Axl has ever written.  Axl truly is a genius.  But to really get into it, \\"Patience\\" is an awesome song as well.  The tune and  characteristic whistling is just pure GNR.  I got this album today, and i listened over it once. It is one of my favorite GNR albums now. Second only to Appetite For Destruction, with the Illusion ALbums coming in next. The Aerosmith cover is notable, but \\"One In A Million\\" is the highpoint of this album.  If you're new to GNR or a hardcore fan, just buy it.  It's definitely worth it.
B000C3H4MC|5.0|I just got the dualdisc 5.1 version of this great LP and have to say that I'm very impressed. This is one of my favorite records, so getting a surround version of it is almost like watching The Wizard of Oz in color for the first time. Great job in the remix!! Oh, note to Adrian Belew: Were you channeling Jimi Henrix? <br /> <br />Those of you whose DVD players are not reading the dualdisc, buy a new player. It's worth it!
B0000029DD|5.0|Are you currently in love? This album will make you obssessed. This is Jeff Buckley's first and sadly last fully recorded album. On many lists you may see this album as one of the greatest. It is mature, that is not what you'll hear on eMpTyV. <br /> <br />Devoid of dullness, yet heavily influenced by gospel and Da Man Leonard Cohen this album has stood the test of time. Take a look at these lyrics to \\"Last Goodbye\\" <br /> <br /> <br />This is our last goodbye <br />I hate to feel the love between us die <br />But it's over <br />Just hear this and then i'll go <br />You gave me more to live for <br />More than you'll ever know <br /> <br />and  <br /> <br />Kiss me, please kiss me <br />But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation <br />You know it makes me so angry 'cause i know that in time <br />I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye <br /> <br />The record producer Andy Wallace is still the greatest yet still underappreciated and overlooked geniuses of this time. If you desire music lush in instrumentation, this is for you. Yearning for lyrics that can only come from a love letter, this album is for you. Need to hear a unique, extraordinary, tightly controlled voice cull words that mesmerize. This is for you.  <br /> <br />You may never again hear music as sweet as this, you may have to do what I did on first hearing this, kick yourself for not having heard this sooner. He drowned in Memphis in 1997. But he has left us his legacy. <br /> <br />This is truly a musician who has brough tears to people's eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006GAOBI|5.0|When I watched Donnie Darko I was blown away! I bought this movie because a friend told me I needed to see it. I think that everyone should own a copy of this film. It is the greatest movie that I have ever seen!! I highly reccommend this film to everyone!!...................................................................Do you believe in time travel?
B000AMJDHY|1.0|First off, to anyone who thinks that this band sounds like the Killers, or dance-synth-pop in general, BE WARNED. They are emo in disguise. I did not hear one second of a dance beat, it was mostly whiny and heavy, not upbeat and fun like the Killers or anyone similar to them.  <br />Watch out, because even their looks are deceiving. They are wearing suits and vests like the Killers and Louis XIV, but they do not sound anything like them. If you don't believe me go listen to them at PureVolume, they are emo.
B00000634J|5.0|A great CD, showing what john Lennon is really made of. All songs on this greatest hits album are perfect. The only problem is that it does not include the best of Lennon's work. Yet it is a must buy for all lennon fans.
B000B894AI|2.0|... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.    To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another \\"blockbuster\\" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending.
0385513755|4.0|The Good: Dan Brown has written a real page-turner. I am not usually one to read until I pass out, but this book was difficult to put down from page 1 on. It was quickly paced and had many unexpected twists. Also, although I am not an expert on the theories of the Mary Magdelene / Jesus relationship, it appeared that Mr. Brown did his research.<br /><br />The Bad: the characters in this novel are not well developed and quite shallow. Brown hints at a romantic connection between the two central characters, but fails miserable. There is no chemistry between the two and he should have removed the \\"love connection\\" and focused more on creating richer, fuller people. Others may also find Mr. Brown's writing style a bit juvenile. The book may not have been written for the doctorate crowd, but I thought the language was at least adequate.<br /><br />The Ugly: Honestly, I also felt a bit dirty reading the novel. It was difficult for me to read what I might consider to be blasphemous, and then easily fall asleep. I continually needed to remind myself that this is only a work of fiction. Readers must also remember a essential quote from the book: \\"In the end, which side of the story you believe becomes a matter of faith and personal exploration, ....\\" Approached from this point of view, the book is a very entertaining read.
0440237688|5.0|My cousin borrowed this book from the library. I picked it up out of idleness about an hour ago, and have just finished reading it. <br /> <br />This is a great book. The theme of conformity at a great cost is a very deep one, and the author makes it clear that we cannot deny the very things that make our lives worth living, even if by denying them we have the chance to get rid of the things that make life so painful. I blazed through the book as is my wont, but the basic story has made a strong impact on me and I will not easily forget what images were presented. <br /> <br />What is sad is that the society does not even know that it is missing out...
B00000JNNY|5.0|Etta James has mastered the perfect blend of sophistication and soul. Her ear for the 'just right' arrangements and production, (which might normally be credited to her producers and arrangers), has been consistent throughout all of her various producers and arrangers, and so, must be credited to her.  Nowadays, a lot of amateurish backing tracks are  accepted under the 'down-home'  banner, so here's a tip: Listen to all that other stuff first, because after Etta,  it just sounds like  underachieving.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This is one of my new favorite movies!!  Great cast, great tunes, great everything!!! Everyone see it ,rent it, buy it!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I do not get critics sometimes i really dont, i look at reviews by critics and they say this movie was decent but not good enuff, i look on my cable box and they give it 2 out 4 stars, wtf this movie deserves way much more well anyway the peaple here with better taste in movies love it. <br /> <br />I am so proud of Ashton Kutcher, after watching this movie he proves he can do a drama and a suspense, I really think he didnt have to do that at the end by telling kayleigh he hates her i mean theres some stuff he coulda done before better than what he did and on the director's cut, omg i coudnt belive it, he killed himself, damn, well anyway this is masterpiece in my opnion, and i lock it my vault for fav movies. <br /> <br />Overall:5/5.......Smart and a Masterpiece
B00009MGR6|2.0|Yes,that's right.It was 1988 and MTV had succeeded in sucking the life out of rock 'n' roll: Awful hair-bands and wanna-be's flooded the airwaves.(remember Warrant's Cherry Pie?) AC/DC's new album at that time said it all: 'Blow up your Video!' This album and tour had alot of monumental events. The first being the return of Harry Vanda and George Young (Older bro to Malcom and Angus) as producers. The second being the last album with drummer Simon Wright (Dio). <br /> <br />Wright is a very talented drummer( I caught one of his drumsticks at the Long Beach show in '88!) Phil Rudd was taking time away to fly helicopters. The third event was Malcom leaving the band right before the US leg of the tour. (He was replaced by his nephew,Stevie. Malcom went into re-hab for booze.)  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this was their weakest album.Only the first two  <br />tracks rock real good. The energy and lyrics dry up right after that. Phil had been missing since'83and the balance of the band <br />had been thrown off a bit. On paper, this album should have been one of their great ones. It was a hit on the US charts. It got lots of radio airplay. It just isn't remembered as great, like Back in Black or Highway to Hell. It falls short. Still, AC/DC never sold out or changed their image to conform to the plastic late 80's trends in music. Angus said it best: \\"We didn't want to be part of that mainstream rock out there. We never wanted to be packaged and sold. We never went out there to sell our souls.\\"  <br />Let that be a lesson for Poison and Motley Crue!
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|Back To Bedlam is a great CD that is a mixture of alternative rock, jazz and northern soul. James Blunt sings with a lot of energy and soul. His music stays with you long after you have turned off the CD player. If you enjoy jazz or alternative rock then you will like Back To Bedlam.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Mr. and Mrs. Smith had a lot of great action scenes.  They aren't the typical driving through a busy street car chase kind of action scenes, which makes them interesting.  Plus you have two very attractive actors, who are very good at playing the role of super-spies.  The story was a little cheesy - two secret agents are married but they don't know their spouse is also a secret agent until they are pitted against each other in their missions - but you can forgive the cheesiness because it was a great movie. <br /> <br />But the movie is funny, too!  To add a bit of humor, most action movies have really buff men making terrible plays on words, and it would have just been better to leave it out.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a bit more personality.  There is a plotline (though not exactly fleshed out) about their domestic relationship that adds a ton of humor that is actually funny!  I definitely laughed out loud multiple times during this movie.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are very funny people, and they carried the jokes off really well.  They could have been overdone (like in most action movies), but they were subtle enough to make them really funny.
0553579908|4.0|This series can easily become the new LOTR books.  Where's the director of those movies to translate the Ice and Fire books to the big screen and do for GRRM what he did for Tolkien?  Anyone who has read and/or liked the LOTR movies will be just as big a fan of this series too.  My only complaint is that GRRM devotes entirely too many chapters to the do gooder Starks, particularly Catelyn, who is my least favorite character.  The way she gushes on about her son Robb the King makes me gag.  OTOH, if you're looking for a character with excessive hand wringing/soul searching qualities, then Catelyn is the drama queen for you.<br /><br />Her daughter Sansa is the runner up and they both deserve a swift kick in the rump, IMO.  I take a certain degree of satisfaction when they're getting slapped around because Sansa is especially deserving of it. And while GRRM has made Tyrion the token bad guy in which to give a POV, he is hardly representative of the truly evil Lannister clan.  I'd love to see chapters devoted to the POV of Cersei, Joffrey or even Tywin Lannister himself.  It would be a welcome change from seeing the world of the 7 Kingdoms through the eyes of the increasingly tiresome Starks.
3937406328|5.0|Wich popmusician would have the idiot idea to bring out 11 albums and a dvd, with brand new music on them? Why would anybody bother to listen to that much music of one artist? A lot of cd's are boring within 60 minutes, and there's so much more good music being made on this planet.    Chris Rea obviously had that idiot idea, and he had some thoughts about the blues too. A fatal and selfoverating combination, I would expect. Chris Rea has made some albums in the past that were a bit boring. But the high level of his music on The Blue Jukebox, made me think that this man was doing something right. Could this album be any good?    I knew Rea is a pretty good guitar player, who plays a mean slide. I already liked his voice. I liked the good popmusic on for instance Shamrock Diaries. But is anybody capable of filling that many cd's with blues, with his own personal style and voice without falling into an irritating form of narcism?    I also had my doubts about the originality of an album with all these different styles of blues, done so many times before.      For the reasons that no one in pophistory had pulled this off  before, my strong believe in the power of the blues and pure fascination for someone's intension to do such an outrageous project, I decided to buy the box.    And, by the allmighty Thor, towering high above us, this music is allright. This band is tight. This man can play.   Each album has a period or region in the blues as a starting point. What Rea does not do is take the blues in a riged way, but he does things with it. Sometimes he very much sticks to the original blues of that period, but you can also hear a popblues-variation very similar to older music of Chris Rea. Always played with the instruments of the period or region of the cd.    The music sounds pretty relaxed, but is also very tight. Altough most of the work may have been done by Rea himself, the reason why the album sounds good has everything to do with the band. Essence of the bluesnaturally is the rhythm. A lot of blues done by popmusicians don't really sound like blues, tough the right chords etc. are used. But a real bluesband always has something more to offer. His band is a real bluesband and Chris Rea has become what every older musician should become: a bluesman. He proves it with 11 cd's full of blues! This kind of arrogance has to be rewarded.

B00082IJ08|5.0|That is among the first of the words that pop into my head when I think of this album. This album is pure musical genius. Very original and interesting. The tracks are unique in their own way, each offering something to look forward to. \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" is definitely what attracted me to the album and hence has served its purpose well on the album. It will draw you to the album and the \\"Intro\\" will rightly introduce you to the mood of the album, dark but original and haunting.\\"Fire Coming out of the monkey's head\\" is awesome storytelling with apt music. I could actually imagine every word uttered in that song and saw it all happening in my head.  \\"El Manana\\" is very refreshing. Overall I give this album 5 stars for sure. I wasnt even a Gorillaz fan before this album. I sure am gonna catch up with their album \\"Gorillaz\\" and any other musical pieces they come up with.
1117066037|5.0|I object to the previous review of this book.  I do not believe that the book glorifies anything about war.  One needs to take the time to research the names presented in the book and then the book will make more sense.  Hemingway had no idea the Internet would ever be invented.  He named \\"names\\" that no one would have really had access to in his time.  We do now.  And I am no one to second guess Hemingway.   <br />      Would anyone say that Robert Jordan was having a good time?  I think not.  Let us also remember that one cannot write, with such vivid detail, that which Hemingway wrote about in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS without actually having been there himself.  He knew then and if we would only know now.  Hemingway is not for everyone...besides OLD MAN AND THE SEA.
0312995423|5.0|Digital Fortress, a novel by Dan Brown, is perhaps one of the most on edge books I have read. In Digital Fortress, former NSA hacker Ensei Tankado gets mad at NSA because of the massive supercomputer, TRANSLTR. TRANSLTR is a 1.9 billion dollar computer, loaded with three million processors, that is used to crack encryptions alone, but the reason that Tankado gets mad at the NSA is because they do not just use TRANSLTR to monitor terrorist activity like originally planned, they monitor ALL MAIL. Therefore, there is no privacy through e-mail or computer data transfer. Dan Brown is a mastermind author, making the book miraculously hard to put down, even for necessities like eating and sleeping. This is Brown's first novel, and it is wonderfully written, It seems like the action never stops and you are always being surprised. Digital Fortress is one of my top three favorite books, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially someone who is computer or electronics oriented. Dan Brown was interested in code-breaking and covert government agencies, which helped contribute to this novel. Dan Brown also has researched the topics of his novels, for instance, the power or TRANSLTR and the cooling required for the computer would be necessary. Also, the knowledge of ASCII codes is accurate. Brown is definitely not an author who will write about a topic without good knowledge of the subject. Also, Brown can make the book seem so real, after reading the novel I have wondered several times if there really is such a computer that exists. Also used in Dan Brown's novels is a bit of the language used in the country the story is currently taking place in. The descriptions Dan Brown uses, may not be the same as Charles Dickens, but is still enough to feel like you are there. One example is, \\"A blast of hot air hit him in the face. It carried with is the sharp bite of Freon gas. Billows of steam swirled out of the opening, illuminated by the red utility lighting below\\" (p. 194), whichhappens Chartrukian is going below to the internals of TRANSLTR.  Dan Brown is also good at creating seemingly real relationships between the characters. Susan Fletcher and David Becker seem like they would be a real couple that have jobs that interfere with the relationship, but still manage to stay together.
0684803356|5.0|I have read many reviews of this piece of literature.  Many are so well written and observant.  I did not read all 212 so maybe I'm going to repeat what someone else has said before me.  I apologize if that is the case.       I took the novel in small pieces.  I stopped and thought about what was being presented to me.  I actually researched the names of the individuals named in the novel.  I would suggest that anyone who reads the novel do the same.  It is historically accurate which adds to the quality of writing.       I will not over elaborate on the story told in the book as that has been done already.  I can say, however, that the novel will have many different meanings for each who read it.(sorry for that)  I find that chapter 35 is really effective in mitigating my anger when I think I am really ticked off.  I simply read that chapter and then I realize that there is no good reason to actually be mad about whatever trivial issue that may be on my mind.  How dare I even consider a rant when there is chapter 35...       [...] everybody but the people and then be damned careful what they turn into when they have power.\\"       That is some serious medicine.  If only more people would read this book before they come to power.       This is no book for a casual reader however.  Damn.      Good Luck
0671027344|5.0|To try to convey to an adult what we as high-schoolers go through is like trying to teach an old dog new tricks. They just don't seem to comprehend the struggles that we face each and every day. But, hand The Perks of Being a Wallflower to your parents and they will look at your life differently. The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is an almost chilling story of a young boy names Charlie and his experiences as he transitions from being Mr. Big-shot 8th grader to a puny freshman in a peer controlled world called high school. Though it is not specifically said, Charlie's life takes place in a town very much like that of what Chbosky grew up in himself, perhaps hinting at the similarities between Chbosky and Charlie. Charlie's jump to high school is made alot easier through the help of his two new best friends, Peter, and Sam who happen to be seniors. As seniors they have already gone through what Charlie is facing and can therefore relate and help him through their own first-hand experiences. <br />  <br /> The book is written through Charlie's letters to someone of undisclosed name, age, and gender, this technique almost allows the reader the believe that Charlie's letters may even be addressed to themselves and can get invloved with the book emotionally on a higher level thus providing for a more enjoyable reading experience. Charlie's letters, though not written on a daily basis by any means, almost creates the feel of a personal journal that we are reading without his knowing. His letters he writes are most likely a way to relieve the stress that he has built up, a release, a way to get the weight off of his shoulders. Do we know if these letters will ever see a another's mailbox? We can't know, the reader makes up their own opinion on that one. To make it seem as though a fourteen year old boy did write these letters, Chbosky will add small spelling errors on purpose to simulate the writing of a kid. Chbosky uses effective narration through the mind of Charlie so well that some of Charlie's events may be some of Chbosky's that he could not tell anyone when he was younger and this is his way of releasing it now after all of these years. <br /> <br /> Through the book, we learn of Charlie's experiences and stories. Some are truly traumatizing and shocking while others make it seem as if his life is all good and peachy. But unfortunately for Charlie, his freshman year is filled with problems and drama. Due to some awful events as a child, Charlie has lost his trust in women it seems. Even though he manages to get a few girl-friends, trust issues force them apart. It seems as though he is more comfortable around men than he is woman, perhaps this is due to a certain life-changing event as a child. As long as you have experienced high-school this book will speak to you on so many levels. Things in your life will relate to Charlie's even though you may be of different race, sex, or background. The main message conveyed in this book is that life is precious and is not something to be taken for granted. Every day you are lucky to be alive, so that makes it a good day which should be lived to the fullest. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a solid book. You will get something out of this book no matter what. It is almost impossible to not relate to this book. Everyone has at one time or another been affected by peer pressure, whether it be lying, drugs, or even sex. This book will hit some spots in you that you didn't even know you had. Though there are some minor discrepancies, such as a fourteen year old boy not knowing about certain sexual things, this book is a must read. Your life will be changed in some way. At least some Parents and adults will respect teenagers a little more and understand what they go through each and every day. <br />
1401307450|5.0|I am a big Red Hot Chili Pepper fan and was definately looking forward to reading this book. I couldn't put it down! I am not a big book reader & have never written a review on Amazon, but I had to for this one. Anthony Kiedis' memory is fantastically detailed. Good sense of humor. I enjoyed reading about him and the band from the VERY early years. I knew he'd had addiction problems, but didn't know how deep and dark. Yes, the fixes and girlfriends got a little redundant, but that was a big part of his life.  <br /> <br />I felt like after One Hot Minute, he sped up and skimmed over the years, compared to the detailed past. I really enjoyed hearing some of the stories the inspired songs as well! I would definately like to read a book from another band member's point of view!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Well, I missed the extended version on TV, so I was bound to get this at some point, even though I already had the existing DVD of the theatrical cut; I am a fan of the books ( only the ones written by Frank ).  As others have pointed out, the long version has been available overseas for some time now, but I only have a Region 1 player.    Most of the new scenes are great.  About 16 minutes in they really get good.  However, the beginning is terrible.  Virginia Madsen has been virtually eliminated from the film, and replaced by a male narrator.  ( Sharp-eared fans may notice that part of her monologue from the theatrical cut can actually be heard during a certain scene in the extended cut... )  In place of the graphics used for the theatrical cut's \\"secret report within the Guild\\" we now have photography of artwork.  In some places ( especially the first battle for Arrakeen ) the sound mix seems to have really suffered from the original release.  Maybe this is due to the fact that it was presented for TV.  There is a bit of missing dialogue ( [Do you]\\"..know of the Water of Life?\\").  Entire scenes from the original film are absent from the extended cut, censored for the TV release ( I guess the Baron spitting in Jessica's face is just too much for the little kiddies ).  Perhaps most disturbingly, certain spaceship landing or flying shots are reused, often in completely inappropriate places.  There are new musical cues added, which are interesting in some places but unnecessary in others; in fact, the new cues seem to impede the original ones at times.  The early scene with the Guild navigator is somewhat ruined by a lack of the original voice and steam effects, as well as unnecessary added expository dialogue.  I should point out that all these issues date to the TV release; the extended cut on the DVD seems to be a faithful transfer of that version of the film.     If you are a fan of the books, get this for the extended scenes, which are generally pretty good ( see Patrick Stewart rock out on the baliset!!! ).  If you're not into the extended scenes, the theatrical release is the definitive cut of this film.      A word to the not-so-wise: when you say things like \\"the extended cut was not directed by David Lynch\\", pray tell, what in the name of Shai-Hulud do you mean by that?  Is it possible that a 2 hr.,57 min. extended version of a 2 hr.,17 min. David Lynch film could be directed by anyone other than David Lynch?  And while we're on that question, what is the meaning of \\"is\\"???  Somebody get a Truthsayer in here STAT, these kids need some schoolin'!!!  ALAN SMITHEE IS NOT A REAL PERSON!   ALAN SMITHEE IS THE NAME LISTED ON A FILM WHEN THE DIRECTOR WANTS THEIR NAME REMOVED FROM THE PROJECT!  Reality check complete.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled misinformation.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|no i'm not shocked that john mayer wails on guitar through this album. i've been knowing he could play. i've seen him on eric clapton's live at the crossroads dvd. what i am shocked about is to see all the poor reviews on here! i can't believe this! i mean i was a fan of john mayer's other albums as well due to the sootheing relaxation feel you get from his simple sounding little melodies and his calm voice. but ever since seeing that clapton dvd, i was wondering when he was going to come out the closet so to speak. i mean he can really play! well this is it! this is the cd! he grew his hair out and he's bringing it in full scale force! people are complaining about the production of this cd. i think the production sounds absolutely fantastic. what is with you people!?! if it isn't perfectly popy produced to your likings of brittany or christina (who aren't even true musicains) it isn't good?? if you are a fan of john mayer or a fan of bluesy type songs that are played and sang with true feeling, than buy this cd!!! if not than wait untill brittany can lose that pregnancy fat and get back to being a sexy dancer, i mean a \\"musicain\\".
0823023494|5.0|I was happy to find that this book included every aspect of character design that I needed. Throughout the book, Tom offers assignments for the reader to keep up with the progression. This book is a must for any artist dealing with characters; from web animation to comics, to feature films. Definitely a worthy buy, and I can't wait to see his next book!
B000022TT4|4.0|While the album contains some tracks that are not present in this movie which document to 'capture the moment of the making of an album' as stated by the band members, while the band goes on with their American tour in support for their epic album THE JOSHUA TREE Lp- the movie did succeed in capturing the essence of the band in that period, if that is indeed the purpose for the making of this flick (and to cash in some profit at the same time, matter-o'factly, of course). Consisting of behind-the-scenes backstage interviews, sessions, rehearsals, and concert footages - this documentary feature also contain certain portions that are not included in the companion 2 Lp set:    * `Exit' (live) = A fine better rendition of the song from THE JOSHUA TREE, which wind totally hacked nearly to a completely pointlessly passable track when it appeared in its studio version due to the production rendered by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. In this live rendition- the essence of the song is very well audibly felt as a bluesy track, which segued into the song 'G.L.O.R.I.A.' - not their track from their 1981 sophomore album OCTOBER, but rather by their fellow countrymen veteran recording artists Van Morrison & The Chieftains.    * `Where the Streets Have No Name' = the very track that's used for its movie trailer (included on the dvd) where the band is seen entering the stage (and the first shot to bring the concert footages in colour) presented in slow motion for the trailer; and also there's the live rendition of their chart topper `With Or Without You'; plus their epic ballad from the same JOSHUA TREE album `Running To Stand Still', and a great heavier rock live rendition of 'In God's Country' against it's atmospherical country-ish studio version which appeared in the said album.    * A performance of their song 'Mlk' and 'Bad' from their 1984 lp THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, that didn't level in any way close to their classic performance of the song that appeared in their 1985 4- trackedep (consisting of a pair of studio outakes and one of the couple live tracks from the said album), WIDE AWAKE IN AMERICA - that rather turned as a curio when Bono perhaps on an absent-minded impromptu impulse sang a pair of ROLLING STONE songs by the end of it - seguing to 'Ruby Tuesday', (which went quite incoherently to the theme of the song), and most peculiarly ' Sympathy For the Devil' - that seem to tell the song 'Bad' is rather spoken under the perspective of the so-called virtue-istic sentiments by no other than Satan himself! Perhaps just an incidental quirk, or perhaps an intentional pun of sorts coming out from Bono- who years after donned the McPhisto-devil alter ego persona of his against the Fly, who stands to symbolize egotistic arrogance in its persona, being that Bono had the knack for 'tourrette' psyche, flaunting whatever criticism or comment that's thrown the band; which I guess is also the responsible driving factor for U2 to turn techno-pop, almost to a point that's as scary to sound nearly a lot like the pop music of Michael Jackson.     However, on the RATTLE AND HUM lp, there's that track called `God part 2' - an antithesis for John Lennon's track which appeared on his 1970 debut album PLASTIC ONO BAND - a song which state that Lennon only believes in himself and his wife Yoko Ono against NOT believing anything or anyone else - whence the U2 song went to state \\"I don't believe the Devil, I don't believe his book... I believe in love.\\"    * 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' = When I first saw this then, I got a little peeved rather than blown away when they played this perennial track o'theirs - seeing that Bono appeared to've tried to force himself in trying to move the audiences with his anger-filled rhetoric regarding the revolution on their homeland of Ireland. Bono did stated however before the segment is shown that they almost never did included this said segment in the film- thinking that many are not likely to comprehend or relate to the grievances that they are expressing regarding the Irish's plight about Ireland's political struggles; which is followed up by their performance of 'Pride (In The Name Of Love)' that wrapped up the flick- with the song 'All I Want Is You' playing in the background as the end credit rolls up.    The portion for `The Star Spangled Banner' which opened up their performance of `Bullet the Blue Sky' actually happens to be the very same Jimi Hendrix rendition that appeared in WOODSTOCK - quite a bit of a feat that's not different from what peeved George Harrison regarding the band in filming their video for `Where The Streets Have No Name' on top of a roof, as its been done before; in this case Hendrix's performance of the American anthem's been used on the opening for Neil Young's great concert movie RUST NEVER SLEEPS. The movie, although containing a number of tracks that appeared as well from its lp companion did have some of those tracks as different versions to those that appeared in the album- such as `Angel of Harlem', `Love Rescue Me' and ` Desire', which are live studio sessions, that on the latter the band lengthened the refrain of the song stamping some pun about traveling-preachers (which also went as the same case from a line on the narration portions of their performance for `Bullet the Blue Sky'); and the full live rendition of `I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' (which is on the album) only appeared here as a segment, wherein the song is being practiced by the band with the gospel choir on a small community chapel (with tolerant looks on the faces of the Christian choir- perhaps seeing that there's no real Christian message in the song).    Overall, although some had dismissed this whole documentary movie feature as merely a whole lotta nothing but some \\"pRattle and Hum-bug\\" from U2 -- it's quite one of the finest music films about a band ever filmed.    No flags are waved.      RATE: 8 out of 10
B000002U9Y|5.0|Its sad that people who are listening to \\"Wish You Were Here\\" don't know who the song is referring to. Being a Syd fanatic, I tend to focus on the first two albums. By the time of Saucerful of Secrets, Syd Barrett was being edged out of the band because of his erratic behavior (such as writing a song called \\"Have You Got it Yet?\\" and constantly changing the chords to frustrate the other band members).  This was not the end of his career as he did two quite brilliant solo albums and still paints to this day.  However, by the time of Saucerful of Secrets, David Gilmour has been enlisted as the singer and Roger Waters took over the creative control.  On a song by song basis:<br /><br />1.Let There Be More Light-dark, somber, very heavy, prog rock starts here.<br /><br />2.Remember a Day-whimsical ode to childhood, obviously inspired by Barrett<br /><br />3.Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun-Performed live during the Barrett era but obviously a Roger Waters song-absolute classic<br /><br />4.Corporal Clegg-\\"Corporal Clegg earned his medal in a dream\\"-anti-war without being preachy. Another classic<br /><br />5.A Saucerful of Secrets-Close to avant-garde classical. Another prog rock inspired masterpiece.<br /><br />6.See Saw-Too close to Remember A Day to be original<br /><br />7.Jugband Blues- Syd's last work of genius. The only song he sang on Saucerful but he claims to have guested on guitar on a couple of others-To some a self diagnosis of schizophrenia but lines like \\"I'm greatful to you for making it clear that I'm not here\\" are jabs at his by now former bandmates as well.<br /><br />Anyone who considers themselves a Pink Floyd fan and has not heard this and the first album, \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is missing out.
B000667FN8|1.0|Haha these guys are bad. Or more like these girls are bad. The singer is so annoying and feminine whining about her girlish issues wishing she really was what she likes to think she is, a guy. Oh boo hoo, life must be so hard for you money making whiny babies. I am sure you're almost poor with the loads of money you probably get from your parents like spoiled rotten brats. Go get some real problems next time.
B000BH4YFE|5.0|I was in my early teens and The Slider was one of the first, if not the first, record I purchased. T Rex was my first concert I attended also - happened to be on my 14th Birthday. So will be bias in my review. But received the double CD in the mail yesterday, and enjoyed opening this CD immensely. Rhino has packaged the CD beautifully, including a nice booklet. I have listened to The Slider CD, and part way through the alternative mix CD, and the sound quality seems excellent.  It is more than appreciated that a record company would take so much care and I suggest that any T Rex fan, young or old in years, or long term or a more recent devotee, should buy this CD. Electric Warrior may be my favourite T Rex album, but The Slider has many outstanding songs, including the title track, Ballrooms of Mars and Main Man, hit singles in Metal Guru and Telegram Sam, and the odd rocker in Buick Mackane. Although a pioneer in Glam Rock, I think both Electric Warrior and The Slider show Marc Bolan and T Rex had substance.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|I was skeptical at first about seeing this movie; I was like \\"yeah there he goes again.. another actor turned director trying to show his skills eh?\\"    Anyways I waited till the movie was on DVD before making my move... and I must say that I was so moved by the movie that I sat and watched the screen for five minutes after the whole thing was over - \\"Dang! why didnt I see this in the theatre??\\" I said to myself.    Unlike most reviewers I did not read the book before watching the movie, but I cannot imagine the book being much better than what I experienced in the Movie. Sean Penn was incredible as Jimmy.. O my goodness, the emotions he went through were so REAL and excitingly believable - you have to understand that before watching Mystic River I had seen I Am Sam, and believe you me this guy 'Sean Penn' depicted both characters so covincingly!! I am a Sean Penn fan for LIFE!    Kudos to Clint Eastwood, dude has put together two very nice movies - I hope the next movie from him is not so sad/depressing i.e. Mystic River and Million dollar baby. That said, he put his best foot forward with this one, you simply can't go wrong with this movie - just make sure you dont move when you start the movie cos you want to savour every taste till the very END ******
0790729628|5.0|Forget anything you\\"ve read to date (a/o 2/2/06).  The only version you'll need is the origional theatrical release with Mr. Ford's voice-over...without it would be like watching The Sound of Music without the sound of music!  I've watched 'em both and threw the director's cut away!
0143034901|5.0|Ruiz Zafon's book makes him my best \\"new\\" fiction author of the 21st century and his translator deserves high praises too!  I assume that this novel would appeal to people other than bibliophiles, like myself. Hopefully living in Los Angeles won't hurt his writing, because I am eager for his next novel!
0440238609|3.0|Pullman's writing is very vivid and there are some very interesting concepts but the books reach a lame conclusion which ignores most of the concepts raised. I like S.F.that has intellectual themes and carries them out to reasoned conclusions, which Pullman doesn't. \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" seems like filler.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I purchased this DVD at a Wal Mart only to find that it was not fastened inside the package upon opening.  Because of this it was scratched on both sides extensively.  I went back in and exchanged it.  Same thing.  I went back in and moved all the other DVDs for Dune and I could hear that the DVDs were moving around in each package.  After putting up quite a fight to get a refund I went to Hastings and all of their Dune DVDs were having the same problem.  So it seems that every Dune DVD in my home town is defective.   <br /> <br />I noticed that one reviewer here on Amazon mentioned that his DVD was loose inside the package and was defective but he was able to exchange it.  Unfortunaly I can't here because they are all defective. <br /> <br />I was wondering how the DVDs that Amazon are shipping out are.  Would anyone be willing to comment on this?  If Amazon is shipping out DVDs that are securely fastened and scratch free I will order one from here.  Otherwise I fear that I may never get to see this movie ever again. <br /> <br />I would also be interested in contacting MCA Home Video directly.  I looked for a way to do this on the net and I was unsuccessful.  I just want them made aware of this problem so they can address it.     <br /> <br />Thanks.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|GET THIS ALBUM!<br /><br />Wow! I've always liked Pearl Jam, but this double disk collection proves their greatness. Not only did they have enough extra material lying around to produce one disk, but they had enough to produce two! And this stuff is not just decent faire, rather it is actually BETTER than half of Pearl Jam's albums! Further, the music is varied and mature, probably because the material spans so many years. So forget all the best-ofs and most of the live albums and get this gem!
0790731452|5.0|For anyone who said that this film sucks has to be crazy. Mars Attacks! is a great film. Tim Burton is one of the best directors ever born and he made this film like the old sci-fi movies of the 1950's. The look of the film is great and the acting is comical and that's the way it has to be to blend well in this movie. This is a wonderful movie and you should buy this movie, its cheap and trust me you will love it. If anyone out there is reading this who may work in the WB DVD department or if Tim Burton may read this please please please make a Special Edition DVD of this film. The Fans Want It!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|\\"Lady and the Tramp\\" is basically about a young Cocker-Spaniel named Lady and her meeting with Tramp, a dog who lives life to the fullest and their adventures together.<br /><br />It's light-hearted and adorable with no sad events like some other Disney films tend to have.<br /><br />This is perfect for children of all ages becuase the animation is beautiful and the plot is easy to understand; especially, for younger children, who might have difficulty understanding more complex Disney films.<br /><br />Also there are no death scenes, which makes this beloved Disney classic ideal for children of all ages.<br /><br />The music is also enchanting and entertaining--my personal favorite is about two Siamese cats singing.  Children will be enamored by them; espcially, if they have a beloved Siamese cat as I did growing up from childhood into adulthood.<br /><br />I saw it when I was 8 years old and I highly recommend buying or renting a copy because this is an ideal animated Disney classic that is sure to be enjoyed by the whole family.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film is appropriate for children of all ages and your chil(ren) will be amused by the cute, and entertaining songs.<br /><br />Buy or rent it, you'll be well pleased!

0792162803|5.0|\\"Superstar\\" is about a Catholic high school girl, whose dream is to be kissed. The main character, Mary Catherine Gallagher (played by Molly Shannon) lives with her widowed grandmother in a small 2-story house. Her grandmother dreams of her grand-daughter being a successful businesswoman, but Mary Catherine Gallagher's dream is to be an actress and get kissed!<br /><br />This movie is hilarious. With zany characters like Evian and Summer (Evian was named after \\"bottled-water\\"--it's a hoot!<br /><br />One of the funniest scenes takes place when Mary Catherine Gallagher is getting ready to go to sleep and her grandmother goes into her room and Mary Catherine Gallagher says, \\"My parents died because they were eaten by sharks,\\" and the grandmother replies with, \\"Oh, I just told you that make you feel better.\\" The grandmother then explains about a Irish folk-dance and what really happened to her parents.<br /><br />The grandmother like Mary Catherine Gallagher are both extremely hilarious.<br /><br />This movie is hysterical. You'll be glad you saw it--I know I was! You'll be laughing throughout the entire movie!<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone over 13 due to mild violence and profanity.

B00005NRO3|2.0|The ending to a horror movie can make or break it & just like 'I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER''URBAN LEGENDS' & many more flops since Wes Craven's original & excellent slasher parody 'SCREAM' Craven's follow up 'SCREAM 2' is ridiculously broken by its ultra lame ending. It was a decent slasher flick most of the way through & then destroid by its ending! I truly believe that this is one of the movies that marks the beginning of Wes Craven falling off the great horror director wagon! I mean come on look at his most recent flops 'RED EYE' & the absolute intolerable 'CURSED'. What happend Wes!

B00005JO0J|5.0|Who says Sci Fi movies are dead?  This film offers substance, humor, drama, visual treasures and musical spleandor.  It screams for a reprise both on the big and small screens.  And what do we get instead from Fox?  So-called reality TV.  Serenity and Firefly were more real than any of the other drivel on the tube.
B0000640VN|4.0|The movie Kate and Leopold is a wonderful romantic-comedy with a touch of science fiction. The beginning of the film takes place in New York 1876; Leopold (played by Hugh Jackman) is the Duke of Albany who invented the elevator. Leopold's uncle expects him to choose a wealthy bride before the night ends in order to bring money into the poor family. Leopold sees an unusual man (named Stuart) with a digital camera and follows him to the Brooklyn Bridge, where there is a time portal, which brings Leopold to present day New York.  <br />Stuart (played by Liev Schreiber) found the time portal from 1876 to the twenty-first century and, naturally, Leopold is confused when he sees new technology and peoples' actions. For example, he was fascinated by a stereo and a television, and he was interested and also rather appalled by how busy Americans had become. Americans, it seems, are always running around, and always have somewhere they have to be; Americans are not as relaxed as they were in 1876. Leopold meets Kate McKay (played by Meg Ryan) who is a hard-working woman, who is afraid of love and change; she is lonely and very successful. Leopold is intrigued and fascinated by Kate who is much unlike women in the 1800's. For instance, Kate is a very impressive woman with a great job and she tries to look really tough, when at times, we see through it. Leopold has never felt love before and he believes that \\"marriage is the premise of eternal love, as a man of honor, [He] can not promise eternally what [He's] never felt momentarily.\\" Kate, likewise, is still getting over a previous breakup and believes \\"love is a myth\\" and \\"you can't live a fairy tale.\\"  <br />While both Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan bring humor to the film, Brekin Meyer (Charlie, Kate's brother) plays a hilarious actor who has trouble with the ladies.  This can be seen when Charlie talks about himself and tells stupid jokes to impress a woman, but it only makes it worse. With the help of Leopold, Charlie gets thegirl and becomes a true gentleman.  <br />I believe this movie did a wonderful job with the changes and developments of the characters. For example, in the beginning of the film, Kate is very uptight, busy, and independent, but as the story progresses, she sees that love is real and she learns to follow her heart. Another example is Leopold, who believes \\"love is a leap\\" that he is being forced to jump, but then he finds a reason to take the leap himself because he finds a woman he can be happy with.   <br /> The beginning of the film was rather confusing and slow, in that it took a long time to figure out what was even happening. The thought of a time portal off the Brooklyn Bridge was a highly improbable instance that gave the movie a turn for pure silliness than anything else. However, once Kate and Leopold meet, one becomes fixated on the beautiful romantic relationship in which they share. But this movie is not just about the relationship between the two main characters, there are more topics to the story. For example, Kate's brother Charles and his dating life or acting career. Another example is the plot of Kate's possible promotion in her profession. There is also the story of Stuart and his problems while he is in a hospital because they will not sign the release form because they find him crazy. This creates a fun-filled story about different aspects of life and not just romance.    <br /> While the love story is similar to the new film Pride and Prejudice (in that both films have a kind, intelligent, loveable gentleman who falls in love with a more modern woman, who is not like traditional women because she is strong willed), this movie is not just about love and relationships. Kate and Leopold is also about the belief that we do not always have to do what is practical or expected of us, but that we can follow our hearts and choose the seemingly impossible path, which is often the most enjoyable.     <br />

0307276902|1.0|I woke up with vomit in my hair and a hole in my stomach and blood on my fingers and a strange woman sitting on my face and James Frey's book in my lap. <br />Where am I. <br />You're right here. <br />Who are you. <br />I'm the girl sitting on your face. <br />What's this. <br />That's a book. <br />What book. <br />The book you were reading before I sat on your face. <br />I remember now. <br />Reading the book. <br />You sitting on my face. <br />Yes. <br />Can you get off my face. <br />All you had to do was ask. <br />I'm asking. <br />Fine. How was the book. <br />The book. <br />Yes the book. <br />Oh god it was aweful. <br />You didn't like it. <br />I hated it. <br />But everyone loves it. <br />Everyone's insane. <br />Everyone but you. <br />Apparently so. <br />Why did you hate it. <br />What's not to hate. <br />You think you could do better. <br />I have done better. <br />Baloney. <br />I can prove it. <br />Prove it. <br />The book's at my parents' house. <br />Your parents' house. <br />Yes my parents' house. <br />Why is it at your parents' house. <br />Cause I wrote the friggin thing when I was eight is why. <br />When you were eight. <br />Yes when I was eight. <br />Why are you repeating everything. <br />For the effect. <br />What effect. <br />It's called white spacing. <br />White spacing. <br />Yes white spacing. It's a screenwriting device to move a text along. Verticality. Forces you to move through a text. <br />It's very manipulative. <br />It's a tool screenwriter's use to keep producers awake. They hate reading. <br />Who writers. <br />No producers. <br />What about this book you wrote. <br />Oh the book. I wrote it when I was eight. In Mrs. Brown's english class. <br />You wrote a book. <br />Yes a book. <br />You're saying you wrote a book. <br />When I was eight. <br />That is better than... <br />Than this dog vomit in my lap. <br />The vomit's in your hair. <br />I meant the book. <br />James Frey's book. <br />Yes dog vomit. <br/>Oh his book. <br />What did you think I was talking about. <br />So you didn't like it. <br />I hated it. <br />Because... <br />Because there's nothing likeable about it. It's sloppily written, and lazily written and obviously derived from a screenplay and the utter absence of proper punctuation is maddening... and ooooh, I'm drunk and I'm high and I have a gallon of steroids leaking out of my butt and a mob hitman is coming to rescue me from demons and I'm in jail and I'll kick your rear if you look at me again dig it? <br />That was very stream of conscious. <br />So what. <br />It's compelling. <br />Sure. Or lazy writing. <br />You're just jealous. <br />Hell yes I'm jealous. I'm jealous and envious and angry and manipulated and used and violated and tricked and duped and fooled and cheated. <br />Because of this book. <br />Because of the manic hyping of books these days. And the lies and the embellishments and the garbage reviews by alleged insiders and the books are just ho-hum or worse, they're garbage, but people have the nerve to compare this crap with Hemingway or Faulkner or Kerouac or Bukowski and those guys could write and this is just crap. And marketing. And stupid, gullible me. <br />You're just jealous. <br />I'm mad. <br />I'll sit on your face again. <br />Oh hell, why not. <br />You're done reviewing the book. <br />I was done before I started. <br />That's a yes. <br />To the end of the review. Not the book. <br />Of course. <br />This is very stream of conscious. <br />Yes. I'm a friggin genius. Is why. Sit on my face. <br />I thought you'd never ask. <br />I'm not asking. I'm telling you.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Most of you maybe you are saying that this is overrated but that means it's a hit, something to be a hit needs to have some airplay, I think a song like \\"How You Remind Me\\" or any other huge hit must be always on radio stations, then why older songs of 70's and 80's they are on radio everyday?<br /><br />By the way, \\"How You Remind Me\\" was one of the biggest hits ever and \\"Silver Side Up\\" was the beginning of a successful future for Nickelback. I'm really get bored with all the guys that bury this band. All the bands have to start from somewhere.
0441172717|5.0|Rarely has anyone managed to achieve the excellence that Frank Herbert has with the spectacular tapestry of future fantasy in his Dune series. An epic masterpiece and MUST read for any serious fan of science fiction. The rich Dune storylines weave such disparate disciplines as philosophy, economics, politics, anthropology and religion into engrossing storylines so effortlessly the reader forgets he is being treated to speculative treatises on social, religious and economic systems spanning galaxies and time. Dune is the greatest scifi epic ever created and the shining jewel in the crown of the genre.
B000BNX3AU|5.0|I had a conversation with a friend who was busy panning \\"Must Love Dogs,\\" the recent Diane Lane/John Cusack movie that is now making the rounds in the video stores.  In support of his argument, my friend pointed to the many reviews that panned the movie on sites such as Amazon.com and Rotten Tomatoes.  \\"It's not only `just' a chick flick,\\" my friend said, echoing many reviewers' complaints, \\"but it's a BAD chick flick.\\"  Having seen the movie, however, I must object to this assessment.  My take on this film is that it is like going to Denny's for a burger: maybe it's not up to the standards of a pricy steak house, but that doesn't mean it is a bad meal.<br /><br />This film is standard issue almost every step of the way; there are NO surprises: boy meets girl; boy loses girl; boy gets girl back again.  It isn't Hamlet; it is basic romantic comedy all the way<br /><br />But, one thing this film DOES have (in addition to a FANTASTIC soundtrack!) is a cast that handles every line, every quirk, every inside joke and every moment with style, grace and a warm believability.  Diane Lane has never been sexier, more appealing, or more likely to have every male in the audience wishing he could meet her in person for even just five minutes.  Cusack does not hit a single false note; and their chemistry together is palpable.  Stockard Channing and Elizabeth Perkins turn in familiar, well received performances...and Christopher Plummer simply shines.  The screenplay, too, should be credited for providing small one-liners that help carry the movie easily from one plot point to the next.<br /><br />Maybe the best part of the entire exercise, however, was that it featured a cast of ADULTS, who more than ably gave lie to the popular Hollywood concept (Are you listening WB?) that the ups and downs of romance are only for teens and twenty-somethings; indeed the only two twenty-somethings in the film come off quite badly as shallow, brainless, and not worth the time of either rest of the case or the audience.  More to the point, perhaps, was the underlying message that maybe it really DOES take some maturity and wrinkles before we truly understand -and deserve- real love.<br /><br />This film was, right down to the closing a pleasant experience, and watching the credits roll was much like paying the bill after a meal at the local hamburger palace: it certainly wasn't sirloin, but it wasn't bad either.of the case or the audience.

1400079276|5.0|Todays word is brought to us by the only Japanees author I've ever read, Haruki Murakami: DRAMATURGY.  <br /> <br />page 287 Kafka on the Shore: <br />\\"The stone itself is meaningless. The situation calls for something, and at this point in time it just happens to be this stone. Anton Chekhov put it best when he said, 'If a pistol appears in a story, eventually it's got to be fired.' Do you know what that means?\\" <br />... <br />\\"What Chekhov was getting at is this: necessity is an independent concept. It has a different structure from logic, morals, or meaning. Its function lies entirely in the role it plays. What doesn't play a role shouldn't exist. What necessity requires does need to exist. That's what you call dramaturgy. Logic, morals, or meaning don't have anything to do with it. It's all a question of relationality. Chekhov understood draumaturgy very well.\\" <br /> <br />People who are somewhat adaptable understand dramaturgy. They don't spend time asking,'why does the gun have to show up in my story' or being scared of said gun. They deal with the gun (or in Kafka on the Shore's case the stone), they accept without fighting it and move on.  <br /> <br />The characters in Murikami's latest story flow with it's inertia: Kafka running away from home, drifting to wherever chance (or is it) takes him. Nakata, an aging simpleton, able to speak to cats, unexplicably drawn to a stone. The truckdriver Hoshino, shuttling Nataka from city to city, always lost as to the destination or why they travel at all. Others also seem caught in the flow of time, spiraling towards a final confrontation. <br /> <br />As in most of Murakami's books, that conflict is not resolved in the way you would think. This novel leaves more questions and uncertainty than any great novel should. However, if you've read any of Haruki's works then you are more than accustomed to this. <br /> <br />If you have never read anything by him I would equate his style to that of Johnathin Carrol, with Murakami being the clear better of the two. But, even that is not an apt comparison. I can honestly say that I have never read anything quite like Murakami. If you plan on starting, I would try Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World or (the most popular in America) The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.
0312995423|1.0|This was my introduction to Dan Brown and oh my gosh, what a disappointment!  It was like amateur thriller meets Harlequin/Mills and Boon!  Interesting and promising plot but too contrived. Cliched, hackneyed dialogue, melodramatic lines like \\"I will heal your wounds\\" (ugh!), one-dimensional characters, and implausible scenarios! I think Brown either wrote this book with a movie offer in mind OR this novel was previously rejected by publishers and then accepted for publication after the success of the Da Vinci Code.  Great idea for a book but poor delivery.  Got exciting toward the end though - hence it rates a star!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Although 'Ultra' is by far, their absolute best work ever (and yes I'm thinking about 'Violator', 'Black Celebration', 'SOFAD', 'MFTM' etc...when I say that), this album is everything 'Exciter' fell just short of. However, as much as I like the MUSIC in Dave's 3 songs on this album, his lyrics are cringe-worthy. Let's face it, he's no Martin. But overall I give him an 'A' for effort. <br />All of Martin's work is, as usual, impeccable, with \\"Macro\\", \\"John the Revelator\\", \\"Lilian\\", and \\"Sinner in Me\\" leading the pack. <br />I feel sorry for people who don't know who DM is or aren't willing to give them a chance.
B0009K7RES|4.0|Hi! First off, if you're deciding between this EP and the full-length CD Shangri-La (7 of the 8 tracks on One Take Sessions are alternate versions of songs that appeared on Shangri-La), definitely buy Shangri-La, the full-length version. It's a beautifully cohesive album that you can get for a good price.<br /><br />One-Take is for the Knopfler fanatic, and it is an excellent buy for such fanatics (like me), almost a gift from MK.  The highlights are the rough, live \\"feel\\" of the music (as on \\"Trawlerman\\" and \\"Sonny Liston\\"); the mix, which has MK's guitar to the forefront and eschews overdubs; and Mark's playing: he adds more fills here than on the full-length releases, playing off of the lyrics, and that's sort of what MK is all about for a lot of us.  \\"Tupelo\\" and the aforementioned two are good examples of this, making all 3 (and maybe Everybody Pays) superior to their Shangri-La versions.<br /><br />But there are some odd decisions on One Track that keep it from achieving 5 stars.  First, \\"Boom Like That\\" is disappointing, dropping 2 choruses and not adding much guitar-wise, tho the singing drips with vitriol.  But then--and this is just my taste--I have to question including Rudiger, Donegan's Gone, and Stand Up Guy over so many other songs that we'd love to hear alternate versions of: 5:15 most obviously, but also Sucker Row and Shangri-La, to name the top three.  These three songs are a lot more interesting musically and lyrically than the three that were included.  And Rudiger really sticks out--if he's going to dig back into his solo catalogue for a song, I mean, we could all name 20 more interesting songs: Speedway, Silvertown, Old Pigweed, Hill Farmer's Blues, on and on.<br /><br />So that's the quibble.  But when all is said and done, here are eight brilliantly performed, generally brilliantly written songs by the guy whom many of us consider to be the most wondrous, unique guitar player of his generation.  A down-to-earth genius playing some great stripped-down music.t stripped-down music.

B000002549|5.0|In 1963, when Streisand released her first album, there was no doubt she was a unique and talented singer. Some ten years later, after becoming a great success, she proved with \\"Classical Barbra\\" what a nurtured and developed talent is capable of. She didn't sit on her laurels and continue to churn out Broadway warhorses in an attempt to play it safe. Instead, like a true artist, she challenged her abilities. Her reward, and ours as well, is this absolutely gorgeous CD. Her voice, at a level of near perfection, glides effortlessly across each tender note of these well picked gems. If anyone ever doubted man's reason for existence, please, do yourself a favor and buy this CD. You will be inspired for a lifetime.  <br />
B000AA305M|1.0|I really like the song \\"The One I Love\\" but unfortunately the cd was copy protected. I agreed to having the software driver installation in order to be able to play the song on Windows Media Player. However, the copy protection was not compatible with my SONY CONNECT player or my mp3 player. It was really a horrible problem until I read other reviews to tell me how to get rid of the driver.    (...)  My advice: Buy the CD if you are computer savy and can understand the above description of how to avoid the problem of the copy protection. Under no circumstance agree to having the evil copy protection software installed on your machine when you put the CD into your machine.... you will regret it!!!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|This will be short and sweet. This movie is by far \\"the\\" best film I think I have ever seen. So far I've seen it twice and the ending left me in tears both times. I am so happy that someone made a true to life story about gay love. I am also happy that there was not one swish or lisp in the whole film. I can not wait for the film to be releashed on DVD. I recommend this film to everyone.
0553584537|4.0|3.5 stars.  This was my first Gardner book and I'm happy to say that it won't be my last.  Begining with Catherine who is an interesting piece of character development.  The reader never truely knows how they feel about this socialite.  You hate her, you love her, you hate her.  But when the facts roll in about what truely happen the night of her husband's murder/hit whatever--a reader has to stop and say-wait, hold up.  This woman took one heck of chance that what she wanted to happen would happen.  A BIG chance.  I mean, a person would have better odds hitting a Mega lottery.<br /><br />Bobby, half the time had the word \\"idiot\\" painted on his head.  I'm almost convinced of it.  Gardner tries her best to get us to relate to Bobby's plight, but she lost me the night of Prudence's death.  Why did he drive over there again??  If we had a hero with a little more sense than a four-year old, then we wouldn't have had much of a story--that's for sure.  The incest angle was easy to pick up-though it still turned my stomach and I just have a hard time believing that Maryanne was clueless to all her husband's evil doings.  Still, Gardner is a very talented storyteller who deserves to be mentioned along with the likes of Connelly, Martini, and Kellerman.  Recommend.
B00005JNX0|3.0|Madagascar is your typical children's movie.  In fact, this computer-animated feature had the least amount of adult humor of any other one I've seen.  The only character that is really funny on their own is Mehlman the Giraffe, voiced by David Schwimmer.  And the only reason he's funny is because his character has a gimmick.  There are a few funny moments throughout, and the pack of lemurs are fairyl entertaining, but there really was no story at all, and the animation wasn't all that great compared to recent features.<br /><br />I'm sure children love this film, but for me it was the same old schtick, different title.
0812550706|2.0|My father, a big SF reader, and my wife both absolutely raved about this book.  I've also read a lot of scifi and thought I'd check it out.  Well, the beginning was mildly intriguing.  The middle was modestly interesting.  I knew there had to be a fantastic twist and/or ending coming up.  Nope.  Kind of like a prime time TV show: midly entertaining gristle for your mind to chew on if there's not something truly insired around.   <br /> <br />So why all the hype?  To this day I really can't tell you.  Bad taste?  Not having read anything better?  A love of all things mediocre?   <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|Mel Gibson in his fascination for Christ came up with this version of the last few days of Christ. Since I have an interest in all religions (I went to a Catholic school), I wanted to see this to find the portrayal of Christ. It is a combination of anti-semitism and brutality with more than one hour of flogging and taunting by the Romans and the Jews. It did not show any of his great thoughts such as Sermon from the Mount. The most important thought of Jesus of forgiveness and understanding were totally lost. This means that a simplistic, propagandistic account of the events, that involves blaming the Jewish leaders for Christ's death while largely exculpating Pontius Pilate as the representative of Rome, is enshrined in the movie. One reviewer called this movie \\"Christploitation\\", as America is strongly in the religion spirit and will eat up anything. Using a small budget of $33 million followed by $25 million for marketing, this movie generated a huge profit and makes Gibson one of the most powerful persons in Hollywood. As a profit making strategy, this was outstanding. People like Ismail Merchant who made quality movies with limited budget can learn a thing or two from this approach.  <br /> <br />Gibson also has ridiculous devils and Satanic apparitions popping up all over the place, whose appearance he has plagiarised from The Omen and Don't Look Now. Is it too much to ask where the spiritual dimension has disappeared to? Where is the message of love, and hope? Where is the compelling poetry of moral grace? Does all of it have to be swept away in a tsunami of fake gore? Gibson offers brief flashbacks to episodes like the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper, hinting in the most superficial way possible at what it has all been about in the first place. <br /> <br />For whatever the reason - and it is not hard to guess the true motivating factor here - Gibson has accepted the hateful notion that the Jews and the Jews alone wanted Jesus dead, and that the Romans were somehow hoodwinked into carrying out his execution. To its credit, the Catholic Church itself has gone out of its way in the wake of the Holocaust to declare this loathsome version of events morally anathema. To his discredit, Gibson has chosen to reopen the same old wounds by portraying the Jews as bestial Christ-killers. If you think The Passion Of The Christ is a huge money-maker now, imagine the opening night take in Berlin and Munich had it been filmed 60 or 70 years earlier. The film features a scene where Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest whom the Bible represents as accusing Christ of blasphemy, says that the blood of Jesus should \\"be on us and on our children\\". The phrase - often referred to as the most inflammatory words in the New Testament - comes from the Gospel of St Matthew and has been commonly deployed by anti-semites through the ages. Gibson had originally made the infamous motto the movie's subtitle, but later removed it as a concession to Jewish interests. <br /> <br />Technically speaking, the film is well filmed but monotonous. The violence is so nauseating and repetitive that it is actually a relief when Christ is finally nailed to the cross, as the viewer knows that the ordeal will soon be over, and the nails make a refreshing change from the whips, canes and truncheons. Filmed in the very finest biblical languages, the screenplay is predictably terse, supported by a reliable faux-exotic soundtrack, with roll-the-eyes acting right out of silent films. As Christ the sacred stud, Jim Caviezel doesn't have much to do except say \\"Ouch\\" in Aramaic. As the Virgin Mary, Maia Morgenstern doesn't have much to do except look depressed. As the assorted Jews, the rest of the cast doesn't have much to do except look evil.  <br /> <br />It is well-known that Gibson's father Hutton is a Holocaust denier who recently wisecracked that most of the Jews allegedly murdered by the Germans had merely relocated to the Bronx. Gibson film has said that nothingwill ever drive a wedge between him and Pops; judging from The Passion Of The Christ, he needn't worry on that score. As Dad might put it: This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased. Any Jew-hater would be. An interesting fact is that in Netflix the people who enjoyed this movie also enjoyed Celcius41.11, Michael Moore hates America, FahrenHYPE 9/11, and The Patriot. Any person who is reasonable at pattern matching should be able to draw conclusions. I am saddened that America has become so drawn to religion and gore that they would swallow such a bad depiction of Jesus. Maybe we Jews are responsible for everything wrong in the world, World Wars, Crusades etc.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Most of the negative reviews thus far could be summed up as this: <br /> <br />\\"I can't believe all the good reviews. Don't people know what blues music is anymore? This guy is white, young, has videos on MTV, and somehow has won the admiration of many of the blues greats. But this doesn't make him legit, as ANY true, honest fan of blues will tell you. There's no way that someone like him can understand the gut-wrenching humanity that is a prerequisite to the blues. <br /> <br />He plays too fast, doesn't have any feeling, and plays way too loud making everything muddy. He may write \\"songs\\", but these are just poorly-lyricized melodies. He's not original - all of his technique comes straight from the blues greats such as B.B., Albert, and Jimi. In short, he has nothing to add to the genre and is just diluting it in some vain attempt to reach the masses.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />What's funny to me is that EVERYTHING above was said about Stevie Ray Vaughan, who has since been almost universally hailed as one of blues' greatest. In fact, it's been said about every popular blues guitarist since the 70's.  <br /> <br />For those who don't listen to blues regularly, ignore any comments that are reminiscent of what I wrote above. It's one of the funny things about the blues genre - it eats its own children for a few years almost as a litmus test of authenticity.  <br /> <br />From a purely technical standpoint, John Mayer - though quite competant - isn't as proficient as many who have come before him. (Granted most mediocre blues players - Mayer included - are light-years ahead of their pop/rock counterparts). But the point of blues never was technique. What John Mayer has done is take blues guitar and put it back on the forefront. It's not my favorite disc, but I love it - if for no other reason than it gives todays preteen girls a taste of something far more genuine and satisfying than teenybop pop. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a tour de force of blues guitar, don't let this be your benchmark. But if you're looking for a solid blues rock album with lyrics that are slightly more mainstream (and deeper) than your standard-issue blues trio, go for it.

B000001DQI|5.0|This was originally on vinyl as a two record set, and they were very skeptacle about releasing it that way, and man I'm glad they did, this whole album ROCKS! When I think of good Elton John music, I think back to his hazy days when he wasn't to sure of himself yet, but cleverly enough produced probally the best material here of anthems like 'Candle in the Wind', the original, before he did it live in Australia, and before he changed it a little for Princess Diane funeral. You also have another anthem 'Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting', great guitar and piano working together. I also liked 'Funeral for a Friend', the longest track on this album, eleven minutes of intense hardship in lyric writing of Bernie Taupin. Then you also got the title track which never gets old, sounds good still, and you got a number talking about a leader of a band 'Bennie and the Jets', I almost think he's talking about Ziggy Stardust. But you also got a few others I prefer like 'Grey Seal' 'All the Girls Love Alice' 'Social Disease' and 'Harmony', this album is truly remarkable and worth the money for as much music you get for one album that sounds great.
B000002JR8|3.0|Listen, I realize that everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion, but when the stupidity starts overflowing, I just gotta step in. I read \\"A Kid's Review\\" in which he was talking about how Pantera was just a group of posers, they are total PU$$IES, etc. So, I'm gonna address these accusations using (gasp!!!) facts and deductive reasoning (Wow, I bet people reading this are shocked that a metalhead knows big words).  <br /> <br />First, the poser argument. It's true that Pantera started off as a \\"hair-metal band,\\" but this image is a little skewed. Yes, the guys looked like body-doubles for Twisted Sister (except Vinnie Paul, who was just laugable), but their music sounded a lot more like Judas Priest Van Halen and KISS, who are ironically enough consistantly cited by the members of Pantera as major influences. Then all of a sudden, Pantera switched over to a more thrashy sound. This happened on the band's second album with Phil Anselmo. Now, Metallica, Slayer and other thrash metal bands were gaining popularity at the time of Pantera's sound remolding, which lends a little support to the fad follower theory. But couldn't the sound switch be more plausibly credited to the addition of Phil Anselmo, who grew up listening to more hardcore and New Orleans styled metal? Okay, the first album with him was still the same style, but the next one was COWBOYS FROM HELL. It makes sense that it took awhile for Phil to feel comfortable with trying to influence his band members. The idea that Pantera were merely wave-riders is further discredited when grunge hit it big. Does anyone remember Pantera hopping on the grunge train? No, and that's because Pantera were simply switching their sound based on their own muses. Many bands do this. I'm mean, for God's sake, look at the Beatles!!!!!! No one calls them oportunists (and don't feed me that sh*t that they \\"invented those genres). And don't forget that Dave Mustaine asked Dimebag to be in his band BEFORE the release of COWBOYS FROM HELL. The fact that thrash titan Dave Mustaine wanted Dimebag, a relative unknown at the time, to join Megadeth, one of thrash metal's leaders, speaks volumes about the band's credibility. <br /> <br />Now to the PU$$Y concern. I don't know of any soft-fannied person who can hold that much alcohol. I mean, those guys are legendary in their drinking habits. Countless metal bands talk about Pantera being the best drinkers in the industry. It was a rite of passage to be able to party with the boys from Texas. Also, if you have read the latest interview in Metal Edge with Phil Anselmo, he talks about never remembering losing a fight in his life. That seems like an honest statement if you take a look at the guy. Most PU$$IES don't have that kind of fighting record. I dare anyone who calls Pantera a band of PU$$IES to get in a brawl with those guys. <br /> <br />Now on to the musicianship. I find it insulting to refer to Dimebag's guitar playing as \\"sloppy.\\" He's hailed by many talented musicians in the business as a premiere instrumentalist. The rest of the band too. Go watch Pantera's home videos. Dime's guitar playing is fluid, precise and technically astounding. That guy plays better completely sh*t faced that most guitarists do stone cold sober. Even Anthrax's Scott Ian will attest to that. Guitar players, look at the man's technique, especially his hand position. The thumb is in the center of the neck, giving maximum speed, reach and flexibility. His artificial harmonics (or squeals, squaws, pinch harmonics, etc.) are executed perfectly and fit perfectly in the rest of his riffs. Vinnie Paul has amazing footwork, my personal favorite in the metal community. He doesn't do the simple 16th note blastbeat every song. He adds groove to the piece. His tom and cymbal fills may even eclipse his footwork. Rex can keep up with Dime and Vinnie; enough said. Phil started out as a Rob Halford protege and transformed into one of the best hardcore vocalists in the business. Hisdrill sergeant bark became one of the most recognizable voices in metal. You can definitely here traces of his delivery in many of the new American metal bands today, such as Hatebreed, Shadows Fall and Lamb of God.  <br /> <br />Finally, the actual record, FAR BEYOND DRIVEN. Let's face it, the record is an okay album. Nothing groundbreaking or surprising. They up the heavy level, which unfortunately affects the quality of the songs in a bad way. Don't get me wrong; there are some great moments on this album. Some songs may actually rival the best on VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER. However, there are moments on here where they experiment a little too much, and some songs are obvious filler. That aside, the record isn't a steaming pile of human waste. There are many metal albums that suck longer and harder than anything in Pantera's catalogue. <br /> <br /> <br />So, Pantera is not the worst band in metal. There are so many bands that are exponentially worse than them. However, FAR BEYOND DRIVEN is not their best offering. Check out COWBOYS FROM HELL, A VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER or even REINVENTING THE STEEL to see the bands true talents and potential. <br /> <br />3.5 <br /> <br />PANTERA DOES NOT SUCK!!!!! HEAVY METAL FOREVER!!!!!!!
B00000CQJZ|5.0|I first saw this at the age of 16 in 1977 and have been a big fan ever since. This early work is the ideal \\"bait and switch\\" plot for which Hitchcock is rightly famous. \\"Classic\\" doesn't begin to describe the neccesity of having this film in your collection.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|It was a good album,  I saw it advertise on the Oprha show.   The only thing on TV there was a photo album, which I was looking for.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth are back, and better than ever before. <br /> <br />For some time now i've loved opeth's unique, complex view of metal. The brutality and intensity of extreme metal is as present in their music as a boot in your ribbage. Yet somehow they manage to fit in those entangling acoustic parts into their songs. <br />Mikael's wide-ranging voice, the poetrical lyrics, the melodies, the raw energy... it all sums up to make opeth stand out as one of the best bands to date. <br /> <br />In their latest release \\"Ghost Reveries\\" they have pushed their compositional skills even further. The tendency of too much repetition of riffs, that was my only problem with their earlier albums, is not at all as present on this one. <br /> <br />This will be a future classic, a must have!
B00005JO9J|5.0|This has to be the best show since Friends. It combines humor and drama and doesn't focus on one too much over the other. The show deals with series issues and some hilarious mishaps. I love the Grey/Shepherd/Addison Shepherd love triangle. It creates a great element to the show and makes me yearn for more (although I don't agree with Shepherd choosing his wife over Grey!!). I recommend this DVD collection to any and everyone.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Can I just say this is a great way in telling a wonderful story of Cinderella. It has romance, laughter, fun and good acting by Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott, it was just so romantic you can never go wrong with this movie..<br /><br />Get your girlfriends and popcorn and watch and enjoy a good movie to let lose to and fantasize what could be.... ENJOY
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Is it just me or were the special effects kinda cartoonish?  Was the overall plot kinda lame and the whole premise kinda, oh I don't know, stupid.  Is it just me or is Hugh Jackman really overrated...Ok forget that comment because when he dons six atamantiam claws and bad hair he kicks major @$$ as Wolverine...but here he just comes across as lame.  I really had high hopes for this film...Coming off the high that was Underworld I was syked to see another monster mash but this film left me feeling a little irritated.  I just really did not like it, and maybe I'm wrong, but this film seems to be one of those love it or hate it type films and I guess I fall into the hated it catagory.  Now Underworld is a monster movie with bite..this was just a monster movie with bad acting and horrid special effects.  Don't waste your time.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|I am a huge Priest fan. Compared to modern metal, this album is not bad at all. Also, this band is over 30 years old and for them to continue to support (and write) good metal until today is quite an achievement. Too bad this album does not quite delivers.   It starts in a promising way with \\"Judas Rising\\" - which is a good track per se, with all that loud powerful riffage and strong vocals by 'metal god' Rob. It uses a lot of distortion (not my cup of tea), even in the solo - setting the tone for the rest of the album. This track is something different from what you would expect at first, but it is cool and all - just not that instant all-time classic that many fans want it to be. Then I waited for those songs with that unique Priest kick-ass sound, but they never come, unfortunately.    But there are some other highlights. \\"Worth Fighting For\\" shows some excellent restrained vocals by Halford. \\"Wheels of Fire\\" is another bike anthem and i think it rocks in its simplicity. I can't think of any other, maybe \\"Hellrider\\". Priest said they wanted to sound retro with this album, but it is not quite the case - some tracks (\\"Demonizer\\" is a good example of this) just sound too much like Ripper era and Halford's Crucible - with industrial or similar modern stuff influences. I blame it on the producer Roy Z and the band own obsessions with those heavy but boring genres of metal which they flirted with during the 90's. Some tracks are just lame, like the dull anthem \\"Revolution\\" and the head-scratching experiment named \\"Lochness\\". The latter is just long for the sake of being long, because it does not have any interesting progression or tempo change or anything to justify its 13 minutes of boredom. Let's just not talk about the lyrics. Spinal Tap, indeed.   The album is just 10 tracks long and they want to throw obvious filler like \\"Eulogy\\"? It is just a semi decent piano passage being repeated over and over for 3 minutes with silly references to past works in the lyrics - lack of inspiration, maybe? They should've left this track in the studio. I bet they had better songs that didn't make the cut - or had they? The ballad \\"Angel\\" takes a long time to get somewhere and when it does it is just not worthy. Fast ones like \\"Deal with the Devil\\" are decent tracks and are delivered in a competent way, but are not very inspired and wear thin after some repeated listenings. Actually, that is a good summary for the whole CD. The riffs and solos are well done, but few, if not none, are all that memorable. But really, all criticism aside, the hype is what brings this album down. It is just a good album, not great, fellas. Priest can definitely do better. I really expect the next album to be a much better effort.
B0009A40ES|3.0|The reason I say this is because, although the novel was over the top in the effect that it really pushed it's limits it still held a ring of truth behind the insanity that caused you to shiver at the sight of your own shadow.  This film on the other hand doesn't deliver a single shiver because it's focused on proving the whole premise a joke.  The director said she wanted to save Bret's novel from it's own reputation.  DON'T!  It's reputation is what makes it so brilliant.  The novel as a whole delivers wonderfully, while this adaptation left me cold and feeling a little betrayed.  The film went to much for the funny bone and that made it impossible to take it serious, and I know I know, the novel was never meant to be taken seriously, BUT in a large way you are supposed to be afraid of this guy and you just aren't in this film.  Bale is a brilliant actor, and did very well with his wit and charm, but the script as a whole failed to bring the full effect that Ellis' novel brought to the table.  My recomendation is, if you've read the novel and MUST see the movie do so with no expectations and if you've seen the movie and never read the novel...READ THE NOVEL!
B00005K9LN|5.0|Some people think this album is brilliant, some can't really understand what the fuss is all about. I lean towards the first group. All songs are delivered with comparatively simple (to what came before) but very metallic riffs with a production that sounds somewhat dated. Maybe that is the reason why some are turned off by it, but I'd dare to say it makes the whole thing even more unique. And I really don't care because those riffs are hot, man, hell yeah...  \\"Rapid Fire\\" serves as an intro to this great album. It is has great lyrics delivered with conviction with that inimitable \\"tough guy\\" voice by Halford. The music hits hard to create a mood of \\"\\"destruction that's second to none\\" - to quote its lyrics.  Next comes \\"Metal God\\", a fan favourite that is still in the setlist of the concerts because it is that awesome. It has one of the most memorable riffs and guitar solo here. \\"Breaking the Law\\" was one of their first big hits and still today is a very well-known track - it is a ridiculously simple and catchy song.   \\"Living After Midnight\\" is another huge and catchy hit - excellent hard rock moment. I don't enjoy \\"United\\" that much. The riff in the verses has a nice groovy melody, but the chorus is very anticlimatic.   \\"The Rage\\" is another favourite of mine. Some reggae influences in the intro and to make it even better, Ian Hill finally has a moment to shine here. The rest of the album is very solid, I could say \\"Grinder\\" is another track I like. The riff is excellent.  This album is very cool and different from everything else Priest released. If not only for the great songs, you should check it because of that.
0671027344|4.0|The book, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky falls under the coming-of-age genre. The book is about a fifteen year old boy named Charlie and his experiences in his freshman year of high school. The book takes place in a small town in Pennsylvania close to where the author himself grew up. Charlie is extremely naive at the beginning of the book but with help from his eighteen year old friends, he quickly adapts to the good and bad things that high-schoolers encounter in their everyday lives. <br /> The book is basically a journal of Charlie's life but in letter form. He doesn't write a letter at the end of every day but he writes whenever anything out of the ordinary occurs. You can see from the beginning of the book that Charlie has a variety of problems entering high school. You learn that his best friend committed suicide a year ago, and that the one friend that he did have in middle school besides the one that committed suicide, has become extremely popular and never even looks in Charlie's direction any more. Charlie's English teacher takes him under his wing and challenges Charlie to read more difficult books and also encourages Charlie participate in life instead of just being a wallflower. Charlie's first attempt at this, leads him to meeting two of his new best friends with which he experiences happy and depressing things. The fact that Stephen Chbosky is so raw and uncensored in his writing is what really makes this book so intriguing. He goes through just about everything that the average high school student does and maybe even more. He writes about his experiences with drugs, abortion, sex, parties, fights, girlfriends, and other things of that nature. The fact that the book is so true to life is why many readers can relate to this book. Everyone can relate to at least some of the experiences Charlie has. Although it is a controversial book, it needs to be read by teenagers because if nothing more, it will teach you to get involved in liferather than just sit on the sidelines and let life pass you by. It will also teach you to appreciate the circumstances that everyone by whom we are surrounded is going through. It will teach you to respect everyone because we all come from different walks of life, and that the experiences others go through is what makes them who they are. We all start off the same, but we are not all raised in the same environment; therefore we all become different or \\"who we are.\\" Chbosky also does an excellent job at embodying the thoughts that go through a fifteen year-old's mind and even writes the letters with grammar and punctuation errors to add to the realism. I think that maybe the only way he was able to do such an excellent job at writing the book is because it may  be written about the life that he had in high school although he never admitted that this book was a true story. <br /> All in all, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an excellent read and will change the way that you view people that seem isolated. Everyone that reads this book that has been through high school will get something out of it because there are so many experiences and ways to relate to the delicate character portrayed by Charlie. This book may also open the eyes of many parents who have forgotten what it was like to be in high school, and this sudden realization might cause them to pay more attention to their kids in high school. Whatever walk of life you come from, you will pull something away from this book and hopefully it will change your outlook on life as it has mine.

0767827716|3.0|Directed by John Carpenter, A novel by Stephen King, Christine is a pretty suspensful and well done film considering the evil doer is a car. This is one of the Stephen King adaptations worth seeing. I wouldnt say its as good as such classics as Halloween or the Shining but its definetly an entertaining film.<br /><br />The film is about Arnie Cunningham, ''Keith Gordon'' a high school dork whos best friends with a school jock Dennis ''John Stockwell''. After having a knife pulled on him by bullies after school he comes across a car, an old red 1958 Plymouth Fury being sold by an old man. Arnie decides to buy the car despite his friends disaproval and against his parents wishes. Since his parents dont want anything to do with it and are against him having a car they refuse to let him store it at their house so he stores it at a old garage and begins to restore it. While restoring the vehicle he starts to change. His looks, his personality, noone is understanding what is happening to him. He even manages to get a date with one of the hottest girls in school, Leigh ''Alexander Paul''. During this time Christine starts killing anyone who comes between her and Arnie. The only two left are his best friend Dennis and Leigh. They have to stop the car before its too late.<br /><br />Its not Carpenter or Kings best but its definetly worth checking out. 3.5-4 stars
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Longer is not always better in this case.  Adding an extra hour to a movie can be very tiresome to a viewer.  There are only a few extra plot points fleshed out, much of which are not really necessary.  Furthuremore, I simply like David Lynch's vision of the film much better (there are some really cool scenes from the Lynch version, which have been deleted from the extended version).  The reason I call this a \\"one trick pony\\" is for me personally I will only view the extended version this one time, and in the future I will watch the original theatrical version.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Never bought any of these guys albums but always liked several of their songs.This is a good collection except for a couple of copy tunes.I'm against seeing copy songs on a greatest hits collection.To me it's suppose to be an \\"original\\" collection from that artist.
0743487478|5.0|Fantastic! <br /> <br />Please read this book. <br /> <br />Very few times in my life, I have encountered certain deep truths that struck me to my core.  This book presented so many that I can say that reading this book has changed me for the better.  I can give a book no greater compliment. <br /> <br />While I could go on about my thoughts about this book, I think a recent comedy sketch hits the point home.  On the Colbert Report on Comedy Central, during a segment called The Word, Stephen Colbert presented the word \\"Jesi\\" meaning more than one Jesus.  He pointed out the many representations of Jesus in modern society and made the following observation-James Dobson, the Christian leader of the group Focus on the Family, in his book \\"Dare to Discipline\\" states, \\" . . . spanking should be of sufficient magnitude to cause the child to cry genuinely.\\"  Mr. Colbert quips that you can tell the real Jesus if you see him striking a child.    <br /> <br />If you sense the shock of the image of Jesus striking children, then you should feel more shocked about the notions of punishment of children that people advocate and read this book. <br /> <br />
B00005U11Z|5.0|When I saw this video of the new Journey,I couldn't believe that Steve Perry wasn't there on stage.The \\"new\\" Steve has the vocals just like Perrys.Dean Castronovo's drumming was awesome and there were plenty of video shots of hime also. <br />This video well worth watching especially on a home theater system .
630469654X|5.0|This movie will stand as one of my all-time favorites.  Its true strength is in the story line -- a classic fantasy with a balance of action, comedy, and romance that should entertain anyone.   <br /> <br />Casting overall is good, with Matt Broderick outstanding. <br />
B00005LC4B|5.0|I actually caught this movie on Showtime Classics and am surprised I've never heard of it. The film had a little suspense going for it and De Niro had a southern accent that was plausible. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange also starred in this seedy thriller about a psychotic rapist, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) who was sentenced to 15 years on molestation charges after being decieved by his appointed attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). The mode for the movie changes from medial drama to an action/thriller/suspense galore after the Max Cady character is out of jail and is brewing up a plot to venge the lawyer he trusted.<br /><br />Max Cady attempts to destroy every person close to Sam Bowden by maliciously hurting them. When Sam is mentally pushed to a corner, he signals to have a restraining order against his former client. The plot them thickens has Max Cady decides to use the tactics that ended up putting him in jail by attracting the fifteen-year-old daughter of Sam Bowden, Danielle, played amazingly by Jullitte Lewis. After preaching his knowledge of being trapped as an adolecent, Max begins to sexually harass Danielle. Sam quickly notices this and decides to end Max Cady's dangerous run by taking the law into his own hands.<br /><br />After sending a gang to physically attack Max, Sam is stricken by the bad outcome and then follows his instincts; getting a gun. Max know decides that enough is enough and is ready to attack Sam's family in their own home; not knowing that Sam isn't on vacation and is actually ready to kill Max upon his arrival. After the failed attempt and escaping with the lives of both the maid and a retired detective, Max fleas from the picture. Sam also decides to flea and tells his family to relocate to a far away port in Florida, not knowing that Max is hiding under the car.<br /><br />The last couple of scenes set the standards for thrilling suspense and will just have to be watched to actually appreciate. The amazing thing was that Martin Scorsese, a master of biopic and dramatization, decided to flex his directing skills on an unlikely and rusty genre. It worked, and the outcome, a 90's classic. Though this film is a better remake of the 60's title of the same name, it suddenly became a pop-cult and parodies were seen in both 1996 Hallowe'en edtion of SNL and the memorble 'The Simpsons' episode featuring Sideshow Bob.<br /><br />This is one of the finest thrillers and cross genre movies of all time. Though there are many films resembling the plot of Cape Fear, this is still considered one of the demanding and finest roles for Juliette Lewis, Jessica Lange and Robert De Niro.Scorsese, a master of biopic and dramatization, decided to flex his directing skills on an unlikely and rusty genre.

0609610570|4.0|I found a lot of helpful ideas and concepts in this book: many of them immediately applicable. Business is a lot of things but, in the end, it's about doing something. This very readable book helps you see the entire chain of `doing' and break it down to quantifiable steps. Mostly I think the book helps you focus in on your business and think hard about your product or service. This focus helps to clarify your processes and goals - whether they are in house framing or motel management - and create plans to do things better. Another thing I like about the concept is that this focus helps you to weed out those things that don't contribute to efficient `doing.' There's admittedly not a lot of groundbreaking stuff here but the presentation is excellent and it's always a good time to look over the basics again.
B00079FUI6|4.0|I recently bought this set blindly (no silly, I have eyes, I've just never seen the show before) and couldn't be happier.  This series is now the reason I'm at home on Sunday nights and not out in the Village like I used to be.  Thanks ABC!  LOL!!
0307276902|5.0|I will be short and to the point:  Does it matter that he embellished his novel?  To me, a memoir does not explicitly contain the entire truth (an autobiography on the other hand should tell the truth).  It is a fabulous book!  I read it before all the hype over the \\"duping\\" of Oprah, etc (poor Oprah by the way)...and I will still stand by my opinon that this is one of the most excellent books I have ever read.
B00092ZL80|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this...  The two best \\"horn bands\\" get together on stage in this double DVD live set in the Greek Theater in LA. <br /> <br />It is true, like another review noted... It doesn't matter if you are white, black, brown, purple, or green with red polka dots!  The music covers all the bases and appeals to virtually EVERYBODY!  In other words, if you don't see yourself jamming to this DVD and bopping along with the music, there is something wrong with you... <br /> <br />The opening DVD has the bands together on stage and they do a few tunes together.  Then they all joke around and actually flip a coin on center stage about who goes first. <br /> <br />Earth Wind and Fire start off first and really get jamming with their legendary \\"groove\\" that they are famous for.  Then on the 2nd DVD, Chicago takes the stage and does all their classic hits with their trademark sound.  They are simply AMAZING! <br /> <br />Then when you think it's about over, both bands come back on stage and together, they bring the house down with incredible versions of each others trademark tunes (Shining Star, 25 or 6 to 4, etc...) <br /> <br />For the best effect, wire in your DVD player to the Aux jack on your stereo and crank it up!!!!  :) <br />
0792838068|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas is about the connection of two people concidered outcasts by society: Ben, an exteme drunk man, and Sera, a lonely hooker. Played by Nicolas Cage and Elizebeth Shue respectively, their characters are always authentic and are often rounded with heartwrenching emotion. I think, in fact, one can make a good case that there hasn't been a movie with as great a male and female combo lead performances since. Cage won the Oscar for it, and I think so should have Shue. We see Ben between outright drunkeness and his semi-drunkeness where he expreses his love and care for Sera the only way he can. We see Sera care for Ben and worry about him, and trully love him despite his erratic behavior and perhaps also because of it. There are sequences between the two so good that I dare not begin to describe them.  <br /> <br />This film is more or less a remake of the classic Midnight Cowboy, with the added romantic edge. Some call this film really depressing. While it isn't a happy film, it's really not one that's much of a downer either. There are hard scenes to take, but there are also great uplifting scenes, and nothing that happens in the end is really all that shocking. The movie is not flawless. Las Vegas isn't perfectly depicted, and there are a few too many outside characters that try to add to the shame of Ben and Sera. This is just a great film of connection, love, and understanding, and everything inbetween.
B000063COX|5.0|In 1980, a musical revolution was occuring in the U.K. It was called the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and Iron Maiden was one of those bands. Although they would later becomes more of a progressive metal band, on this first album of theirs, they have more of a punkish metal sound. Paul di'Anno seems to be forgotten nowadays, but he is a really good singer, his voice is raw and rugged and it fits the music perfectly. And the twin guitar attack of Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton (no relation) is pretty damn good too. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the awesome Prowler. \\"Walking through the city. Looking oh so pretty.\\" Awesome start. Nice hard rocker with catchy riffs. Other songs I love are the catchy Charlotte the Harlot and the punk-like Sanctuary. Running Free is a nice little number with a chorus that COMMANDS you to sing along. I mean, give it a listen and tell me that you can't sing along to it! Iron Maiden is another awesome song with guitar riffs to f*cking die for. Trnasylvania is a killer instrumental with some of the best leads I have heard. <br /> <br />Strange World is an awesome slow song. Remember Tomorrow also rules. It has soft and heavy parts, and a killer solo. I love it when Paul sings softly \\"Flickers above us to light up the\\" and then he screams \\"SKY!!!\\" But the centerpiece of the album is the 7 minute Phantom of the Opera. Some nice fast riffs open the song and not once does the song get tedious or boring. Paul sings pretty fast on some parts. Definitely a hint at what was to come.... <br /> <br />This band got off to an excellent start. And they would churn out even better albums later. They were just getting started....
B00009NDAF|5.0|Lou Gerstner writes this book from the perspective of having worked as a transformational leader at companies during periods of growth and change.  At American Express, he oversaw the global adoption of the Amex Traveller's Card and other services.  As a consultant, he moved from company to company, making recommendations, and moving on.  Finally, as CEO of IBM, he presided over a period of great change - from 1993 to 2002 - before turning over the reins to Sam Palmisano.   <br /> <br />Gerstner's experience, then, is as an architect of change; not as one who \\"stays the course\\".  I recommend this book for managers and leaders in all industries who want ideas on how they might lead change in their own organizations.  Gerstner's book mirrors his life in business:  It gets your attention in the beginning, holds it through the middle, and wanes at the end.   <br /> <br />What Gerstner lacks in penmanship, he makes up in concise, direct, and articulate prose.  This is as honest a book on business as any I've read, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.

B000023VR6|1.0|The Once great producer of all time really died with 2pac after he left death row, this album may attract the eminem/50/G-Unit crowd, but he has truly abandoned his true long time fans, most of these songs are completely silly (with the exception of two at a time), the lyrical content is stupidier now, the beats are not that good as it used to be and the the album cover is silly. <br /> <br />This is probably the most embarrassingly overrated album of all time. <br /> <br />If you want a real dr. dre album go pick up pre aftermath dr. dre stuff. <br /> <br />This cd is not for anyone who thinks that a rapper who sues napster for your money. <br /> <br />I Rather download then buy this. <br /> <br />
B00000JCOV|5.0|this is bye far slipknots best cd. Although i am a fan of Iowa, and subliminal verses sucked, this cd cannot be touched by anything else theyve made. ive been a huge fan of slipknot for a long time and ive owned his cd since its first release, when purity, not me inside was on it, which was a much better track. but for the most part, this cd is great and i like pretty much every track on it. some of the better ones (in my opinion) are sic, surfacing, liberate, no life, only one, wait and beed, and spit it out. yeah, that may be half of the cd but like i said its a great cd so its all gold. recently theyve gotten a bad rap but thats only due to the fact that they really blew it with there latest release. instrumentaly there awsome for the most part. plus they have the sickest drummer in joey and coreys vocals are as well. but if you like slipknot, or just metal in general, i deffinatly think you need this cd. And i also suggest getting this before you get vol. 3.
0307276902|1.0|Why does trust matter?  It matter, it matters a Lot.   <br /> <br />The Oprah's of the world inflict James Frey's and Dr Phil's on an unsuspecting and blindly loyal public.  These people are charlatans and snake-oil salesmen.  At worst they separate you from your hard-earned money under false pretenses.  In a worst case scenario people forgo real remedies for hot-air, potentially doing harm to themselves. <br /> <br />Case and point, the now off the market Dr Phil's \\"Shape Up Pills\\".  This $120 a month scam was exposed, but not before Dr Phil made his killing.  Why does trust matter?  Allow me to quote Dr Phil in USA Today talking about the supplements.  \\"I do enjoy a level of trust with a lot of people who understand and appreciate that I do my homework before I start talking\\".  Yet in an email Dr Phil sent internally discussing copy for the marketing of the supplements he wrote \\"...They need to redo the ones that say I created the products b/c I have no expertise.\\"  These quotes were part of the lawsuits that eventually led to the product being discontinued. <br /> <br />The worst thing that happens in that situation is people wasted money.  What about those who inspired by the bs yarn spun by James Frey forgo treatment for their addiction since he kicked his on his own? <br /> <br />Regardless, it is fraud.  A memoir is supposed to be a work of non-fiction, and AMLP is clearly fiction. I think Frey should reimburse every reader who wants his/her money back. <br /> <br />Trust matters.  Truth matters.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. <br />

B000002KET|5.0|This is just one of those albums that you can put in, press play, and just kick back without having to press the skip button. It's really that good. After four heavy metal albums, the band expands their horizons with this release. The songs are a lot more melodic, but still heavy at some points. Rick Wakeman from Yes contributes syntheizers, but don't let that scare you off, this is still a killer album.  <br /> <br />The album kick starts with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. That opening riff is just classic, any fan of the band will recognize it right away. Ozzy hits some incredible notes here, my goodness. Then there is A National Acrobat. A more easygoing song, with nice riffs by Tony. I am always amazed at how he can pull this stuff off. I just wish people gave this song a little more credit. Next is Fluff, one of my favorite instrumentals by the band. It is so different than anything they had done at that point. It is very happy-sounding and mellow. Nice use of a harpsichord i mught add, it really helps the song stand on its own. <br /> <br />Looking for Today is a nice song that sounds a little more upbeat and a sort of sing-along chorus. Not sing-along in the Beach Boys sense, this is still rock and roll, so no worries there. Killing Yourself to Live is another awesome song. Ozzy sounds angry on this song especially when he yells \\"KILLING YOURSELF TO LIVE\\" during the chorus. And I think everyone remembers the part where he goes \\"Smoke it. Get high.\\" That part is classic. Sabbra Cadabra is a melodic and heavy song that is just crushing one minute (Ozzy pulls off some nice screams by the way) and soft the next minute. The synths give the song a spacey feel, while the piano playing is nothing short of outstanding. Only Rick Wakeman could produce that kind of emotion. <br /> <br />Who are You is very heavy on the synths, a lot of fans weren't to happy with it, but I don't mind. It makes the song sound sort of futuristic. The album concludes with Spiral Architect, whichis a monumental closer. It starts with a nice acoustic intro and then the song kicks in. The band defintiely took their experimentation to the fullest here, with the orchestras and everything, but not once does it get bombastic nor tedious. <br /> <br />This album blew down the doors in 1973, things like this just were not heard by a band like this. I hate to even try to categorize it so I am not going to. But what I WILL do is give this album an extremely high recommendation.

B000001GG6|5.0|Krystian Zimerman is my absolute No. 1 among the pianists of our time, not because he's Polish of course, but because he is a true magician. He is often accused, though, that his recordings lack passion, some kind of spontaneity etc. Indeed, it is a fact that Zimerman prepares each of them very carefully and releases them rarely. It is a fact that he studies the notes very long and corrects almost every phrase played before, in order to find even better way of interpretation. But I ask: what's the matter? Do this spontaineity really is necessary while buing a recording, especially a set of recordings? Or maybe one rather seeks his/her ideal, perfect in technique and deep in interpretation, and every \\"scratch\\" on these technique and interpretation makes him disappointed? Well, I know that I am such a person; when I buy a recording, I want it to be ideal. Absolute ideal. Whereas for Beethoven's e.g. Violin Concerto or Fidelio I haven't managed to find my ideal - I actually have for Missa Solemnis (Gardiner!), String Quartets (Alexander)... and for the magnificent Piano Concertos.<br /><br />This set doesn't give me much place to write about, because, as I've just said, there is not even a scratch on this precious gem. Zimerman plays so wonderfully, that when I got the set and listened to all the pieces - I knew I'd immediately forget about my all 3 previous sets of the Concertos. And this happened. Now I listen to it no matter which movement of which concerto I want to hear, because here it is played far better than anywhere else. Do you imagine every note, every second played perfectly? I bet that in all recordings you have there are some moments you'd want to correct, play better. Not here. The cadenzas, brilliant. Parts in the foreground, as well as in the background, behind the orchestra, brilliant.<br /><br />As for the orchestra, I can say with pleasure, that Bernstein is surely in his best form here. He doesn't conduct too slow, as he often does; he is the master of the orchestra, he controls them totally.<br /><br />I should shut up, because it's getting too long, but one small thing: just listen to the samples. The comparison of small details in different recordings is great fun. I don't know whether it is in the sample, but try to compare e.g. the sound of the orchestra in the main theme of the Emperor Concerto's 1st movement in few recordings. Only here it is such a magnificent, sharp, clear melody. Or the beginning of Rondos in the 1st and 3rd. Or... OK, finished.<br /><br />This is the recording of your dreams. Believe me.<br /><br />Pozdrawiam,<br /><br />Gustawe master of the orchestra, he controls them totally. <br /> <br />I should shut up, because it's getting too long, but one small thing: just listen to the samples.

B00004RYS2|4.0|\\"The Faculty\\" is one of those movies where you want to reduce it to simple cinematic equation history, such as \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" meets \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\\" But that is really too simplistic an approach. Not since \\"The Rock\\" have I seen a film that references as many other films as \\"The Faculty\\" (comedy homages in the tradition of \\"Airplane\\" do not count). When you watch this film see how many times you suddenly say to yourself, \\"Oh, yeah, just like in 'The Thing.'\\" Clearly, screenwriter Kevin Williamson (\\"Scream\\") is back to his old tricks, this time in the field of science fiction rather than teenage splatter flicks, aided and abetted by director Robert Rodriuez (\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\").<br /><br />The premise of the film is that the old school kid fantasy about teachers being alien monsters comes true at Herrington High in Ohio. The faculty are only first on the alien agenda for possession. Next are the police, the students, their parents, the folks in town, the visiting football team, and, by the end of the month, the entire world. All that stand in the way are the fellowship of the high school student stereotypes: there is Casey Connor (Elijah Wood), the Stephen King nerd; Delilah Profitt (Jordana Brewster), the campus queen; Stokely Mitchell (Clea DuVall), the goth girl with the encyclopedic knowledge of science fiction films whom everyone thinks is a lesbian; Stan Rosado (Shawn Hatosy), the sensitive jock who wants to be more than a quarterback; Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Laura Harris), the new girl in school; and Zeke Wells (Josh Hartnett), the big man on campus when it comes to drugs.<br /><br />Actually, \\"The Faculty\\" ends ups being one of the most subversive films in history because the big lesson here is that mind altering drugs can save the world (that just cannot be right, people). But it is hard to focus on a \\"message\\" in a film like this where the only real question is how are these kids going to save the world and which on the infected people is hosting the queen? That last one is where Williamson proves he was paying attention to story construction because there are plenty of clues that set up the big payoff, which is usually a sign of competency when considering a film like this. Otherwise the big joke in the film is that the adults are having a lot more fun being monsters than the kids are trying to save the earth. Robert Patrick plays Coach Willis with maniacal glee while Piper Laurie goes for underplayed creepiness. Famke Janssen goes from mouse to lioness, Bebe Neuwirth gets to work on her chilling smile, and even Jon Stewart has his eye-popping moment. Only Salma Hayek is really wasted, given nothing more to do than blow her nose.<br /><br />The end result is a decent science fiction horror film, which is a pretty good deal. We are clearly in a world where a competent film in this genre qualifies as an above average effort. But \\"The Faculty\\" embraces both the history of the genre and the stereotypical characters running around in it trying to save the world. The idea of an unpretentious exploitation film just sounds strange. For me, the two scenes that capture the essence of this film are the suspenseful sequence where the gang tries to figure out who amongst them cannot be trusted and the bit where the new and improved football team gleefully beats up on their out of town opponents at the big game on Friday night. \\"The Faculty\\" plays well in both ballparks. The only serious complaint is that this film was apparently so well crafted by Williamson and Rodriguez that there are no deleted scenes; all this DVD offers in the way of extras is the trailer. That is a downer.<br /><br />Bonus Question: Since this film is scripted by Kevin Williamson can it be read as an allegorical twist on \\"Dawson's Creek\\"? Sure, why not? It just gets a bit complicated, because if Casey is Dawson and Zeke is Pacey, then Stan has to be Jack (the football part, but not the gay part, unless you want to goback to the very beginning in which case he can be Cliff). That means Delilah is Joey (but with Abby's attitude), but then we have to decide if Marybeth the new girl in town or Stokely the girl with a bad reputation is Jen. Since that can work out either way your decision can be based on whether you are trying to work this out in terms of the high school years on \\"Dawson's Creek\\" with Andie or the college years with Audrey.which case he can be Cliff).

I was never able to listen to what people were feeling and to what they were trying to tell me. After reading this book,I am now able to listen to what people are trying to tell me. I understand their feelings and thier needs. This book has really changed my way of communicating. Since I've read this book, My wife and I have not had any problems communicating. It is a welcome change, there is a calm feeling between us and I find it very enjoyable. I hope that anyone who may have a problem communicating, will read this book and I hope it has the same effect on you that it has had on me
0062502182|5.0|I read this book at a time in my life where I was trying to put my life back together after the heartbreaking death of my parents and my husband.  I was afraid to ever care about anything again.  This book touched me.  It inspired me.  The simple storytelling belies an extremely powerful message about the essential nature of life itself.  This is one of those rare books that everyone should read.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I'm a sci-fi lover. That needed to be stated before I begin my review. I love the genre.  <br /> <br />\\"Dune\\" is a prime example of sci-fi gone all wrong. It's cryptic screenplay and elusive terminology bog down an already sluggish plot and overly-simplistic characters. In some ways, the story is ridiculously childish: the unexplained sustance known as \\"spice\\" is sought by everyone in the galaxy, good guys and bad. There's two \\"camps\\" that both want the Dune planet and fight over it. The son of the good guys' chief is the hero of our story. We've all seen this basic plotline a thousand times before. No points for guessing that our hero is also a sort of messianic figure who's rise to power was prophesized and wields superhuman powers. <br /> <br />The philosophy behind the Dune film (I never read the Frank Herbert novels) is very flat and one-dimensional. If the books have more character-depth, the film fails to show it. It's all too obvious who is going to win the day and that the villians will all meet their untimely fates.  <br /> <br />While there are some intriguing concepts in this movie, the effects have not held up well at all over the years. In fact, a good portion of the special effects are downright laughable. The passing of the years is no excuse as Ridley Scott's \\"Bladerunner\\" (which was made two years prior to Dune) has held up far better over time and looks far less dated today. In fact, \\"Bladerunner\\" is a far more interesting story that has much more to say and think about. A sci-fi film like Bladerunner causes the viewer to think whereas ones like Dune try too hard to do all the thinking for you. <br /> <br />The intro-narration attempts to tell a very vague history while showing the viewer cheaply-illustrated story-board sketches in a friendly \\"grandfather\\" voice-over more suited to a children's bedtime story than a great sci-fi epic. The details of the intro are far too complex and the dialog is confusing and irritating to listen to. The entire film would probably have been better to have just left off all narration altogether. <br /> <br />Too often during this movie the characters \\"think\\" to themselves as we see their lips sealed and hear their voices whisper overhead. This technique is unique, but in my opinion it just doesn't work. It looks silly in fact. And even if it may have worked in a scene or two, David Lynch uses it far too often and by just about every character in the movie. <br /> <br />The screenplay is awkward at best, ludicrous at worst. I'm amazed that sci-fi fans have the nerve to attack George Lucas' Star Wars Prequels for their stiff, cardboard acting when some of the spoken lines in Dune make \\"Phantom Menace\\" look like \\"Gone With the Wind\\"! Hate Jar-Jar Binks all you want, but Dune would be improved by adding Jar-Jar Binks to its cast of cheesy characters and obviously low-budget makeup.  <br /> <br />Too much of Dune looks more like a low-budget, made-for-TV sci-fi series. Indeed, one can now sense Dune's influence on many of the Sci-Fi Channel's campy cable TV series such as \\"Farscape\\" today. For people who enjoy this approach to humorless, ultra-nerdy science fiction, Dune must me a triumph. But to those of us who remember science fiction that is intelligent and much better written, such as Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", then Dune is a laughable failure. I believe David Lynch was a disasterous choice to direct a serious, deep sci-fi epic and this movie obviously wasn't given the budget needed to pull it off satisfactorily. <br /> <br />
076790592X|4.0|I found this book utterly captivating, but I must warn readers, it is also very sad.  The slow and agonizing decline that Morrie lives with as his illness progresses is described in such loving detail that you feel as if you are suffering along with him.  The inspiring life lessons that the author gains from taking this journey with his friend Morrie are compelling and thought-provoking.  But be ready to feel his pain as well.
B00008G9JN|5.0|I've been a JT fan for over thirty years and hands down this is my favorite recording by the band. Actually, it may be one of my favorite recordings, period! Without a doubt, Songs from the Wood is a masterpiece that stands right up there with any masterpiece from any genre of music. <br /> <br />My wife and I saw JT two years ago and even after nearly thirty years the pieces from SFTW drew the most excitement from the crowd; and from Ian! He got into Velvet Green as if it was the first time he'd played it. GREAT CONCERT! <br /> <br />In Ian's own words found on the booklet that accompanies SFTW: \\"....one of the best ever Tull albums in my opinion.\\"  <br /> <br />The orchestration on this record is so thick and precise that it boggles the mind. I listen to a lot of classical and jazz of all sorts and this recording spanks most others when it comes to the sheer density of the orchestration. There is very little unused space on this album. This recording is not for those seeking minimalism or laid back sounds. Instead it's for when you are in the mood to have your mind blow away by incredibly precise musicianship and compositional inventiveness. Someone mentioned in an earlier review that the instruments sound like they are clashing. They are not clashing, but contrasting in such a complex way that to anyone accustomed to sparse instrumentation(often found in pop) the meaning of these compositions will be lost. <br /> <br />This is very unique music and will probably be most attractive to jazz-fusion and prog-rock fans as well as to the more open-minded classical fans. Even though it has the \\"celtic folk\\" flavor I don't think that anyone with a \\"soft\\" ear will like it; ie folks that are into soft, new-age celtic. This is NOT anywhere in that style. This is heavy music and those who don't like progressive rock will probably find this album very instrusive. <br /> <br />BTW, Hunting Girl is my favorite piece on the album and one of JT's all-time greats. <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is very Farscape \\"ish\\". If you like Farscape and westerns, you'll love this series. There's humor, drama, love connections and great acting. The show resembles FC because of too many similarities, criminals running from bad guys, living on a ship, being chased by bad guys, hot chicks with guns..There's no character for River in Farscape though, she's way out there......The only thing that is missing is Scorpius and \\"Buckwheat\\" The first few episodes are questionable as the characters evolve, but as soon as you pop in the second disk, you're hooked. Pick this box set up along with the first season of Farscape and you'll never watch that Star Gate show again, except for the current season. Bring back these two great shows!!!!

B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie is amazing: the performances, the scenery (it's really Alberta, not Wyoming), the tragic love story, and the direction.  Ang Lee NEEDS to get an Oscar for this movie.  For the other dolts who won't see a \\"gay cowboy movie,\\" I say this: get over it.  See it and experience the magic for yourself.
038572179X|2.0|The story itself is interesting, I'll give it that. But by the end, all I wanted to do was hold it open face-down, and shake it until all the unnecessary and superfluous description that took of 75 percent of the book sprinkled out. It was slow to start, but my book club promised that once you get past the first 200 pages, it really picks up. It did pick up, but I was overwhelmingly disappointed and felt absolutely no connection to a single character.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I know Mariah needs to make her money so she can buy her Luis Vuitton and Cristal, but this re-re-re-release of this album is shameful.  If you have to release the same album multiple times, it's because the label is desperate for sales, and it's hard to respect ANY corporation that's desperate.  Mariah, I love you, but I don't need to buy 60 copies of the same album.
038572179X|5.0|Wow, this book is amazing, rips me apart emotionally just like Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\": the theme of the poor but smart/romantic gypsy-background boy taken in by the wealthy British family and falling in love with the daughter; then cruel circumstances leading to the mangling of their lives/love in various ways. And the twist at the end of this book really gets me crying. That stupid little Briony girl, Lola and Paul. Ugh. I loved Cecilia and Robbie's romance. So real. It didn't feel like fiction. Star-crossed lovers. Life can really intervene and wreck. Sigh. What a book.
B000683VI4|4.0|I heard a lot about this movie, and I thought that no chick-flick could be that good.    I watched it on cable and I figured out why everybody likes it so much.  Two words -- Rachel McAdams.  She is bangin!!!    It's not that the movie has a good story, it's not that anyone else acted very well, this movie's success can all be attributed to Rachel McAdams.  She's really hot and in this film her role is to be a really hot leading woman.  And man does she pull it off!    There's some other stuff in the movie that makes it worthwhile.  The comparison between the mother and the daughter turns out to be pretty interesting.    The setting was 1940's North Carolina, but no one in the movie had a Southern accent.  Imagine one of the guys from Entourage, playing a saw mill worker in 40's North Carolina -- that's what Kevin Connolly did in this movie.  Rachel Mc Adams's on-screen father, David Thornton really sucked.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I honestly feel this is a two star album, but that is only because Songs for the Deaf was such a masterpiece.  Post-Oliveri or not, there is still something major lacking in this record.  It feels like it never really gets moving.  Little Sister is very good, but the rest of the songs are pretty monotonous.  Where the hell is Mark Lanagan?? Featured only on one song?  He's a major reason why previous Queens records have been good.  I do give this 3 stars - because Songs for the Deaf was SO good, with so much added talent (Dave Grohl was fantastic) that it would not be fair to base a comparison on SftD.
B00005JOFO|1.0|the only reason this film is so \\"good\\" or whatever is beacuse it is a gay couple but if this where a man and woman couple no one would care
B000005HLV|4.0|My initial reaction to this album was that it was terrible. Especially the vocals, which frankly are comically bad. They sound like a really bad impersonation of Peter Lorre. But in time the music has really grown on me... in fact I think it is quite excellent. If not for the terrible vocals this would surely be one of my favorite black metal cd's. Anyway... get the album, it's worth your time.
0920668372|5.0|I read this book for the first time today to my daughter and I have to say that I couldn't get through it because I was weeping at the end.  I recommend this book to anyone, just be sure you have a box of tissues on hand.
B000062YAY|4.0|This was the first Slayer album I ever heard, back in Christmas of 1994. At first I didn't care for it but after subsequent hearings I feel in love with the groups' music. While this of course remains a personal favorite of mine due to the nostalgia factor, it is in fact an excellent album and recommended for any newcomer to Slayer. The performances and sound quality are excellent. The only complaint I have is that at times the left guitar is completely overpowered by the guitar in the right channel. This happens on a few songs on disc one. The track selection is good but I feel there could have been a few less tracks from \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" and more from \\"Hell Awaits\\" and \\"South of Heaven\\". Overall though an excellent and highly recommended live album.
6305971099|3.0|Donald Pleasence gets his name above the title in \\"Halloween 5.\\" After turning in brilliant performances in such noteworthy films as \\"Halloween\\" and, um, \\"Halloween II,\\" he finally got his due with \\"Halloween 5.\\" Surely upon being told the news, he retired to his trailer and drank bourbon until he passed out.<br /><br />(I don't know if Donald Pleasence was really an alcoholic or not. But looking at him, I can't imagine him being anything else. He face looks genetically predisposed to being pressed against a barroom floor.)<br /><br />The posters for this movie called it \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,\\" but the onscreen title is simply \\"Halloween 5,\\" which is good, since Michael doesn't really get revenge on anybody in it. Kills some folks, sure, but they're mostly strangers, not people he had vendettas against. In fact, the two people he would have the most reason to kill -- Dr. Loomis and little Jamie -- are the two people he DOESN'T murder. \\"Halloween 5: The Failure of Michael Myers\\" would be more accurate, though admittedly not as appealing in a mass-marketing sense.<br /><br />After an opening credit sequence featuring a pumpkin being carved -- an act the filmmakers seemed to think we would find scary -- and after a few minutes of clips from \\"Halloween 4,\\" we are brought to the present day: Halloween Eve 1989. Even though Part 4 ended with Jamie -- the young niece of Michael Myers -- becoming evil and apparently the New Michael, now, a year later, she's just a disturbed child who can't talk (hooray!) and who's being kept in a home for creepy children. Why isn't Jamie evil after all? I dunno. Apparenly, Part 4 was only kidding about that.<br /><br />She does have a psychic connection with Uncle Mike, though, and can tell when people are in danger of him. Also, a lot of townspeople THINK she's evil, and they throw rocks through her window with notes attached to them that say, \\"The evil child must die!\\" Just add that to the pile of terrible, terrible things that happen to this girl in the interest of traumatizing her beyond the point of humanity. I would not be surprised if both the character and the actress who played her later turned to a career in pornography. In fact, I would be disappointed if they didn't. (The actress, Danielle Harris, did go on to appear in \\"Urban Legends,\\" which is sort of the same thing.)<br /><br />Jamie's foster parents are out of town this weekend, but she's safe and warm at the creepy children's hospital, under the disquieting care of half-melted Dr. Loomis (played by the aforementioned Mr. Pleasence). Loomis is pretty frustrated with the fact that Jamie can't talk and help him find Michael; how he knows Michael is even still alive is beyond me, since Michael died at the end of Part 4.<br /><br />Michael is still alive, of course; he swam down a river and then stumbled into a shack belonging to an old man, whom he killed (but not before taking a nap). It is unclear when this takes place. We see him escaping the mine shaft he fell into at the end of Part 4, and we see him swimming down a river. Then he enters the shack and passes out, exhausted from the chase. This all happened moments after the events of Part 4, right? Right, except that then it's a year later and Jamie's in the hospital having psychic connections with Michael ... who is still in the shack, where no time seems to have elapsed. The shack exists in a wormhole, apparently, the Shack That Time Forgot.<br /><br />Anyhoo, somehow Dr. Loomis figures out Michael must still be alive -- probably all the freaking out Jamie does clues him in -- and wants to catch him, and the police cooperate but are really, really stupid and do more harm than good, adding more weight to the argument that we shouldn't even HAVE police in this country.<br /><br />Jamie's foster sister Rachel, left over from the last movie, gets killed before long by Michael Myers, who doesn't even bother hiding anymore. He pretty much just stands around where anyone could see him, often in broad daylight, and yet no one sees him. You'd think a town that had been victimized just a year earlier by a Halloween-themed serial killer would be more alert on the anniversary of it. You'd especially think Rachel would be on her toes and not in the shower all the time, considering she was one of Michael's primary targets last year. But who am I to judge? No one's ever tried to kill me with a knife. Maybe I'd pretend it never happened, too.<br /><br />Anyway, Rachel gets killed, which is fine with me, but her replacement as heroine is her annoying `80s friend Tina, a bedenimed vixen with a loathsome boyfriend and an even loathsomer fashion sense. Because she is the most irritating person on the face of the earth, in the perverse sense of justice employed by these movies, she is destined to live until the movie is almost over.<br /><br />Michael seems to have killing Jamie as his goal, but he is easily distracted from it. He comes upon a Halloween party attended by randy teens (\\"Friday the 13th\\" was on its Part 8 by now; the \\"Halloween\\" folks obviously had been watching and taking notes), where he decides he ought to kill all of them, all of them, I tell you! How he thinks this will help him kill Jamie, I don't know. Maybe he's just practicing. At any rate, a really blond couple, including a nearly bald teen-age boy, is having sex -- he with his pants on and not even unzipped, don't ask me how -- when Michael skewers them with a pitchfork. You like to see that happen. I do, anyway.<br /><br />Loomis has it in his head that if Michael kills Jamie, his \\"rage\\" will be quieted, and he'll stop killing. So he uses the poor girl as bait, back at Michael's childhood home, which has grown into a Victorian mansion. The question is whether she is just bait to lure Michael there so they can kill him, or whether the insane Loomis actually plans to deliver her up to her murderous uncle. There are hints of good filmmaking in all that.<br /><br />Another hint of quality comes with a mysterious dark figure who lurks around the movie and in the end busts Michael out of jail. It is merely a hint, though, as it is not resolved in this film, and it is patently unfair to introduce such major plot points solely for the purpose of setting up a sequel.where anyone could see him, often in broad daylight, and yet no one sees him.

B000002U82|5.0|I don't usually read in these PF reviews a lot of notice for the Roger Waters basslines.  Here is a guy who has never wasted a note.  He can't play his hands off like John Entwhistle or Jaco Pastorius, he is sort of like a reggae bassist, well not  stylistically, but although Gilmour wails over him it is the bassline that is the heart of every song, of course the famous 'Money' bassline, but in the similiarly timed lines in 'Breathe', 'Time', 'Eclipse', 'Any Colour You Like', I think is what we mainly hear in our heads remembering the songs.  Waters can't play fast, so he thinks out what he's doing, like the great lines in The Wall's 'Hey You' et al.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite album of all time because I don't want to hear 'Us and Them' again.<br /><br />I heard Claire, the singer in 'The Great Gig in the Sky' only made $300 total from the sales of this album.
B00005JOFO|5.0|for me in this movie, love transcends the principles of logic and should not be constraint or even suppressed by any societal forces..........
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Great and at the same time disturbing movie. What else would some people and big corporation do for profit. Very well excecuted and in \\"European style\\" back and forth made movie.
B00006AW2S|5.0|New Year's Eve: 1965.  A small apartment with a lot of people and this \\"album\\" on the \\"stereo.\\"  Oh what a night! <br /> <br />LOVE Spider and Fly.  And every other song on there.
B0000CAQ26|1.0|Pink sucks. This is a horrible CD and horrible albunm art work. They gave her too much freedom on this CD since Mizzunderstood was a big hit. That is probably why her new song Stupid Girls is so catchy and sing-songy it makes me want to puke as well. But I guarantee they didnt let this wanna be riot grrrl go all hard core again. If they did, this new disc is bound to wind up in the .99 bin along with Try This.
0767817478|4.0|For the life of me I can't figure out why this is titled Godzilla. <br />Anyone who has loved the TOHO classics will be disapointed. It lacks TOHO's \\"Godzilla\\" child like personality to say nothing about Godzilla's Biped(Man in a monster suit)swagger. <br />The reason is simple it's been missed \\"labeled\\". In fact it is a good updating of \\"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\\". In this movie the beast is a (CGI) quadra-ped once again terrorizing New York (Not Tokyo). Eating policemen and finally meeting his /her end in/on a New York Landmark. <br /> <br />The movie is not all that \\"bad\\" although it is played a little \\"too cute and tongue and cheek\\" for the Scifi genre. The movie also suffers from over the top special effects. <br /> <br />Enjoy the Ride!
B000654Z2I|5.0|I'll keep this simple because something this complex isn't easy to explain. This IS like a movie, spoiling all the surprises in it's sound is unjust. <br /> <br />Paperhouse - 4/5. What else is expected? Progressive rock at it's finest and fullest extent. <br /> <br />Mushroom - 4/5. Dancey drumbeat and eerie atmospheric synths. Proto-dance explains it best, along with Damo's vox. Dense mood fitting into the mix of relatively harmless sounds. <br /> <br />Oh Yeah - 5/5. This was the first track that drew me into this album. Damo's vocals are backwards sang with a tape edit, ambient organs set a mellow atmosphere throughout and a repetitive beat closing in on you. Bluesy too. <br /> <br />Halleluhwah - 3.5. Most enjoy this one for it's erratic direction with its structure. Eighteen minutes of building and re-modeling of effects with a relaxing minute or two of piano jazz stuff. Weary in it's settings though, good enough if you have the patience or ears for this kind of experiment. <br /> <br />Augumn - 5/5. Here's where the group loses their minds with experimentation. No rhyme in it's sounds, just a puzzling mixture of unsettling noises and samples (sort of) swirling through the speakers and it just gets more intense in it's point, singer Damo moaning and humming as if he were some god in pain. Really good stuff here that is quite effective in not losing out in it's atmospheres and sound. Be ready for what's within this one. <br /> <br />Peking O - 5/5. If you were to stick a tape recorder in the mind of someone undergoing a psychotic episode then the results would be similar if interpreted to music. IF this can be called music. Gentle in it's beginning and then Damo goes off the deep end in the middle with babble, just incoherent childish babble. It's effective in it's purpose. <br /> <br />Bring Me Coffee Or Tea - 5/5. After \\"Oh Yeah\\", this closer of the album would be the next most mellow track in sound. Not without giving an impression of someone's hands shakingfrom caffeine intake. Organs, catchy drums and percussions. All that Can is always good for closing your trip to their psychoticism. <br /> <br />One of those albums that CAN'T get old with no matter how much it is played. <br /> <br />And quite good as a trip partner. But not sitter.
1401206905|5.0|This book was my very first graphic novel.  I'll be honest, after the greatness that is Batman Begins was released in theaters, I had to see where this origin came from in the first place.  Frank Miller's Batman: Year One is what I found, and it does not disappoint in any imaginable way. <br /> <br />The art is excellent and surprisingly vivid after seeing shots from the Sin City comics, also by Frank Miller.  The story is equally fantastic, providing not only Batman's origin, but a background on several very prominent characters within the Gotham City universe, including the future commissioner Gordon and even Catwoman.  Other familiar names are mentioned in the characters' speech as well. <br /> <br />It's really difficult to find any flaws in this book.  The Catwoman story felt a little tacked on, but this detail is miniscule.  Each and every frame is crafted to perfection, making this a must-own for all who enjoy graphic novels, and especially Batman.
B00007M5CO|4.0|I've had Bajofondo Tango Club on my watchlist for a while. But recently discovering that Gustavo Santaolalla's label was behind this effort was the key to making me check them out. This is a musical collective from Argentina that blends in styles you'd never imagine combined, and it does so both, in style and very effectively. Tango is balanced against trip hop yielding a new form of sensual chillout music that you will find appealing from the first note. While this, the first effort by Bajofondo Tango Club, works on so many levels, I recommend a bit more that you check out \\"Supervielle\\". It's a bit fresher and experimental.
0307276902|1.0|I picked up James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" on a clearance table a few days ago at less than half price.   <br /> <br />The pile had a hot pink post-it note on the top saying \\"Oprah's Sandal Novel!\\"...a very clever piece of marketing on the store's part...  <br /> <br />I wasn't expecting much but I truely couldn't believe what a dull, monotonous, boring novel/memoir/scandal/whatever it was. <br /> <br />It is easy to see that it is a cut and paste of 100's of addict novels that have flooded the market is the last decade.   <br /> <br />No denying that Frey has a flair (and a love of the odd Capital Letter for Importance) but there are dozens of books in this genre that let us into the whole sordid world of excess much better than Mr Frey could ever pretend to. <br /> <br />If you are truely interested in brilliant novel about addiction, my advice is to start with Luke Davies' \\"Candy\\" (before the movie comes out!) and experience someone who can write honestly from an extraordinary imagination; someone that doesn't need to mask his work as recollection. <br /> <br />Must say though, points to James Frey for being slapped on the wrist on international TV...hope he recovers but I won't be looking for him on the \\"reduced\\" and/or other tables again. <br /> <br />
B00000HZH7|5.0|Possessed's 7 Churches was released back in 86, the year after I graduated High School. If I knew then what I know now,Jeff B. and crew play true Death/Thrash Metal the way it was meant to be. All the songs just drip with evilness, fast and brutal. This cd never gets old. Possessed even rivals Slayer in terms of speed and heaviness.If you're into true Metal, Black/Death/Thrash etc,check this cd out.

B000092ZYX|5.0|None of Radioheads albums sound alike. <br />This fact greatly applies to \\"Hail to the Theif\\".  <br />Recipe for HTTT? <br /> <br />1.Tons of piano. <br />2.Pinch of Johnny's abusive guitar riffs. <br />3.Minor chords, riffs, and textures. <br />4.Brilliant Lyrics/vocals. <br />5.Touch of electronica. <br /> <br />Some people dislike it for the lack of guitar...and overdose of piano...but hey! Kid A had almost no guitars either. And anyone who says Kid A isnt great...is simply insane. <br /> <br />I've heard a lot of people say that Hail to the thief lacks \\"signature moments\\". Well i geuss they have never heard \\"sail to the moon.\\" It is a track i would've payed the full $15 for.  <br />The music is A+ quality...paints a picture in your mind. <br />The Lyrics show Thom Yorke at his prime...\\"I sucked the moon. I spoke too soon.

B000B5XZLU|5.0|I have always enjoyed Jamiroquai's albums, but sometimes can only listen to so much of an album before it's too much.  This one blew me away though; if you like Jamiroquai's music you will definitely not be disappointed by this one.
B00000JCOV|5.0|That's just wrong. This album is amazing. Look at Iowa and The Subliminal Verses. Both of those albums have people who hate it. Look at this album. Hardly any Slipknot fans hate this so this is a good start. The reason why people don't like this band is because they don't like the screaming. I know people who don't like metal who like this band so check em out. Something must have to happen to have a thousand and twenty reviews right?    1.742617000027: weird intro.. 3/10    2.(sic): Amazing song, espicially with how they start up the song and end it. 10/10     3. Eyeless: The bass on this song.. wow.. and the chorus. This is an awesome song! 10/10     4. Wait And Bleed: Good song, not the best on the album tho cause it's short. 8/10     5. Surfacing: Probably Slipknot's most vulgar song. Once again another good song, even better with your feeling angry. 10/10     6.Spit It Out: This song is a rap/metal song and you can hardly understand the lyrics cause it's so fast, but still Slipknot does a good job on this song. 6/10     7.Tattered and Torn: Worst song ever made from the band. The song is not balanced. 1/10     8. Me Inside: Also a bad song, but it's better than Tattered and Torn 4/10     9.Liberate: Very good song, you'll hear more of Corey on this song than the instruments. 9/10     10.Prosthetics: To me is the best song on the album. It's not only haunting and loud, but it has a cybortic feel to it. Just amazing! 10/10     11. No Life: Nothing to say but but it's a good listen 10/10     12. Diluted: Best lyrics on the album. This song is flat out amazing. \\"I can stare into a thousand eyes, but every smile hides a bold - faced lie.\\" 10/10     13. Only One: Average for Slipknot, only song on the album that gets old fast. 6/10     14. Scissors:  Great ending. This song sent shivers down my spine cause it's so creepy with the screaming and the scissors like sound at the beggining of the song. 10/10    This album may have 4 flawed songs but that means the other 10are flat out amazing. I'd recommend this CD to any metal head. Any non metal head should check out a single from the band cause I know people who love this band and aren't even metal heads, they listen to country and jaz (gross I know).
0553801503|4.0|I think that I'm different from the majority of Martin readers in that I came to \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" late, and as a result, I've read the whole series straight through without enduring the long wait for  \\"A Feast for Crows\\" that earlier fans had to endure.  As a result, I'm not as disappointed with the pace of the story that others are. <br /> <br />Frankly, the pace of the story reminds me of \\"A Game of Thrones\\"... remember, that book had a slow start as well.  I really see this book (and the next) as the start of a new trilogy - and remember, you'll get your favorite characters (Tyrion, Jon, Daenerys, etc.) back with the next installment as well. <br /> <br />However, I am a bit concerned that the series has lost the focus of the first three books.  Most of the plot mysteries that kept you reading the first three books have been tied up, and \\"A Feast for Crows\\" doesn't really provide any new ones - here's to hoping that \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" up's the ante in this regard. <br /> <br />One does feel that some of the chapters in this book are pure \\"filler\\"...Briene's especially.   <br /> <br />Bottom line, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" really needs to deliver to keep me interested in this series, I felt the first pangs of \\"Westeros fatigue\\" setting in while reading this book.  I also sincerely hope that Martin has a clear endgame planned for this series.  He frequently states that \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" will be told in seven books, I really hope he sticks to that promise...he needs the discipline.   <br /> <br />However, the large sums of money to be made with this franchise virtually insure that the story of Westeros will continue into the future...my bet is on a set of prequel books about the Targaryn dynasty (you heard it here first!). <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I have to say, that against my better judgement, I was a little nervous comming to this film.  I mean, come on, a guy with a pig's head? <br />   HOwever, after watching the film, I hardly even noticed it and found myself swept away but the storyline instead. THough Porco Rosso certainly does not make you delve deep into your reserves trying to figure out why we do what we do, unlike Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke, it is a more lighthearted romp through the post War era. Filled with brilliant animation and memorable characters, Miyazaki does not fail to bring us anothe masterpiece. <br />   This is a great piece of work that everyone from adults to kids can enjoy. There are many lighthearted jokes and plenty of things to quote from. The humor is real, original, and truly funny, unlike the forced nature of most films these days. Even my eleven year old brother and I (i'm fifteen) were in stiches and enjoyed it thoroughly. <br />   One of the best parts of this film are the planes Miyazaki so clearly loves. They look and feel authentic and really pull the film together. Also, we are given a great cast of new characters   with an EXCELLENT english cast. Two thumbs way up! <br />   This, as well as other works by Miyazaki are worth watching and owning, no questions asked. So don't hesistate and enjoy!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I've heard of Nightwish in the past, heard a few of their very very very early songs but this is my first exposure to them.  Once I read the album credits, much to my surprise I found that the entire brain behind Nightwish was the keyboardist, Tuomas Holo... Whatever. <br /> <br />Same with the cds prior to this.  It happens every now and again, that the machine behind a band is usually one or two people.  The only time I ever have a problem with this is when some big-headed hotshot guitarist does all the guitar playing in studio and do live session members when they tour (poor bassists, nobody appreciates them).  At least Dino Cazarez wasn't so egotistical he had to play EVERYTHING in studio as well, though he wrote all the guitar tracks (Christian is better than him, imho). <br /> <br />But since we're talking about Dino, who while he had a distinct style of playing, it could be duplicated (please refer to Archetype before you get defensive and argue).  At least he was a productive member of the band.   <br /> <br />Fans sickeningly attached to Tarja, she offered nothing but her good looks and her voice, something that can (swallow your pride right now) be duplicated 40 times over.  I could go higher, but you wouldn't want to, it's a waste of time and energy. <br /> <br />Nightwish is Tuomas, the band is a tool and device of his musical genius.  Tarja was a drama queen and prima donna.  Expendable and easily replacable. <br /> <br />PS.  Buy the damn cd, you'll be glad you did.
B000002I2M|4.0|This is by far the Doors' most bluesy album, and fans of other Doors hits such as \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Touch Me\\" may be turned off by it.  It is one of the few Doors albums where the best songs are the ones that gained, and continue to gain, the most attention (\\"Love Her Madly\\", \\"LA Woman\\", and \\"Riders On The Storm\\").  Many critics hail LA Woman, along with Morrison Hotel before it, as a return to the Doors' roots, but songs like \\"Been Down So Long\\", \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\", and \\"Crawling King Snake\\" sound unlike anything the Doors have given us before.  They are straight, old fashioned blues songs that lack the substance of the distinctive \\"Doors sound\\".  LA Woman is by no means a \\"bad\\" album (there's no such thing when referring the Doors) and I can understand why many blues fans feel that this is the Doors'  best, but I would strongly recommend that potential buyers sample the tracks and not purchase it merely based on its reputation.
0393317552|4.0|*** A brief summary of this 400+-page book, followed by a critique.     The book is highly recommended. If you do not have time to read it thoroughly, then skim over some details and carefully read the last few pages of each chapter. Do read chapters 1 to 5 and the epilogue in full though. ***    ** SUMMARY and REFLECTION start here **    Consider past and present major civilizations: Egypt, Greek, Roman, China, Arab, Western Europe. Why did almost all of them reside in Eurasia? The current exceptions, USA and Australia, actually prove the rule. They both are also built on European technology and people.     Guns, Germs, and Steel explores broad patterns of the development of civilizations. Diamond proposes that neither luck, genetic endowments, nor great men have decisive influence on the fate of civilizations. Rather, it is environmental factors which reign supreme.    Diamond's reasoning starts from the proximate factors which obviously helped European's conquests of much of the world. Three broad categories of factors played large roles in the process.   1) Material technology, such as gun, steel swords, ocean-going ships.   2) Social organization, especially political organizations and writing   3) Epidemic diseases which most other people, especially native Americans, did not have resistance against.     Why, though, have all those factors arise in most advanced forms in Eurasia, and not other continents? Diamond asked the question and came up with fairly curious answers:     geography and species    First, Eurasia is the largest continent on earth. Its larger size supports a larger diversity of wild plants and animals. Moreover, its measure over the east/west axis is much wider than any other continents. The east/west measure is important because species can spread much more easily along that axis than the north/south one. (Different latitude means different climates, which will be difficult for species to adapt to. Just imagine polar bears trying to live intropical rainforests) Although the combined size of North and South Americas are over seventy percent that of Eurasia, its width is much less, which results in fewer diverse species in any one area.     The geographical advantage (size and east/west spread) translates into a larger number of diverse species. Out of those candidates, there will be a few useful for and worth the effort for domestication. It turns out that Eurasia has the largest number of domesticable animals and plants.     The paths to civilization began with lifestyle change, from hunting-gathering to agriculture. The latter is only possible when there are enough number of species suitable for food and other uses. People in Eurasia were the first to receive those gifts from nature, and thus they were the first to settle in villages. Agriculture brought food surplus and food storage, which enabled denser population and specialization of work. Certain people freed from the daily task of feeding themselves spent their time developing crafts, technology, and writing. Others acted as chiefs and priests to organize the community. In contrast, hunter-gatherers are more egalitarian-all members have more or less equal power and similar responsibility-but that also means they have few ways to invest in the future and long-term developments.    So far we arrived at the reasons for more advanced technology and social organizations. What then to explain the deadly diseases carried by Europeans to the New World? It turns out that the same factor, domestic animals, were the sources of this most lethal gift of conquests.     Why should we not attribute the rise of civilizations to great men? Certainly, men like Newton, Galileo, Alexander the Great, Shin Huang Ti played large roles in the unfolding of history. But they operated within the constraints of environment and cannot exert their influences beyond the support of their society and geography. Newton would be uninfluential had he born into an illiterate hunter-gather tribe, nor could he have a chance to learn enough math to develop sophisticated theories in the first place. Even if he had developed such theories, they would be buried unread for centuries.     ** CRITIQUE starts here **    Under the broad limits of environment, though, we do have a choice. Einstein probably accelerated the development of theory of relativity for decades (if not longer) and thus exerted large influence on lives of many millions.    A major concern Diamond failed to address without bias in this book is the interaction between environment and evolution. Since the environments surrounding people of different continents have been so different for thousands of years, wouldn't that change the nature of those humans in some way? Diamond alludes to the possibility that New Guineans are smarter than Europeans because the selection pressure for their intelligence is stronger in order to survive in the wild, while Europeans need to contend with deadlier diseases which bend the selection pressure toward immunity instead. It can be argued differently that survival-based selection plays lesser role than sexual selection. Men of high intelligence can in principle acquire more wealth and power and reproduce at a higher rate when they are in cities than in the wild. Arguments alone can never settle such complex questions. We need much more varied and balanced empirical facts to support any sweeping conclusions about our past. (In fact it is probable that no sweeping conclusions can ever be justified.)    Diamond's thesis that environment is the overarching factor determining both cultures and fates of societies is convincing, but not the whole story--for he ignores a vital variable affecting us all, human evolution. For a far more detailed objection on this ground, search for \\"Michael Levin's review of Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" on the Web.    -- Noppadon Kamol, Author of a book on Happiness (in progress)
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I think that's why we're so facinated by them.  This story had a little different twist to the gothic, vamp story.  This time the vamps weren't hunting us they have other enemies, the wherewolfs!  Who knew?  Can't we all just get along? All the vamps look good in leather and they always live in a castle, classy!  I wonder if any vampire's live in trailer parks?  The story moved along.  Enjoy! <br />
0440241588|4.0|A nice change of pace for Grisham, moving away from the typical Southern setting has allowed Grisham to concentrate on another part of the world, in this case Italy. It is also a lot less of a legal thriller than previous books and is much more about one mans journey, both literally and philosophically. In fact the A plot about space tech is very much in the background really. Recommended
0780624890|3.0|I like Wesley in just about anything he does.  He is very talented.  This movie moves along quite well, the younger, brash vampires want to take over everyting from the older, classer vampires.   Kids, I guess every species has trouble with them!  Whodathunk it?  Enjoy!

You guys are nuts!!!\\" Apart from tempo variations every track sounded like the last - Bloody 'orrible like someone pounding on a dumpster with a large hammer and someone inside moaning to be let out.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|It's hard to overstatate just how influential this was in 1989. We were all blown away by it. It looks a bit dated now, but is still a lot of fun. This new addition also has some good extras too.
B000007492|5.0|A fantastic CD curtailing Supertramp's mainstream musical success. This digitally remastered anthology includes steadfast versions of every popular hit spanning the seventies and eighties. Greatest Hits Vol. 2 also is available but runs dry of all familiar material presented here. If you would like to feel confident with your Supertramp collection or are a younger listener wondering how to condense group highpoints, this without question is the disc to get.

0553284347|5.0|...to those of us whose childhoods were not fairy tale perfect. Lacking the funding to see a therapist, and having a husband who had the good fortune to have had 2 wonderful parents, I picked up this book, since I knew not who else to turn to. I am thrilled that I did. I read every chapter, even the examples that in no way pertained to me... and they helped. Susan Forward's style is so warm, I wish sessions with her were a possibility for me. The exercises and ideas to break the cycle are already benefitting myself and my son. Thank you Susan for your gift.
0967851408|2.0|You must bear in mind when this book was written and if you are researching the development of self-help books then it will no doubt interest you.<br /><br />However if you are looking of anything to inspire you, then perhaps your money would be better spent on many other titles on Amazon's shelves.<br /><br />The style and format of this book renders it almost unreadable to the normal reader. It repeats the same lines and thoughts ad infinitum and is full of the most out of date pseudo-scientific clap trap that you will ever come across.<br /><br />Statements made earlier in the book take on the status of \\"facts\\" in later chapters. It seems that if Charles thinks of it, then it is true, because he was successful. If you count, conning people into investing in Eucalyptus tree plantations for furniture manufacture and vineyards that don't produce enough grapes, as success, then that is your decision.<br /><br />There was for me a certain entertainment in reading this old Snake Oil salesman's tilt at established religion which earned the banning of his book by the Church. No doubt this was the reason for many of the books sales.<br /><br />Again if you think it will improve your life - don't bother
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I fell in love with the expertly drawn characters and snappy dialogue of \\"Firefly\\" when it belately appeared on the SciFi Cable channel. Having grown up on Star Trek:TOS, I watched the spin-offs with my kids - along with all the Star Wars productions, but nothing galvanized my interest the way the original Star Trek series did until \\"Firefly\\" came along. Every show was smart, thought-provoking, and better the second time around. The attention to detail in both the set and the character performances surpassed anything in its genre. \\"Serenity,\\" the ship, contributed more of her identity to the overall experience than any of her predecesors. Captain Reynold's unabashed love for his ship, wonderfully revealed in \\"Out of Gas,\\" made the closing scene in \\"Serenity,\\" the movie, particularly satisfying and memorable.  <br /> <br />For those who crave smart science fiction, both \\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity\\" are rich treasures to mine time and again. The \\"Firefly\\" series is so indelibly impressed on my psyche that I must admit some minor plot deviations in the movie caused some initial pain; and yes, there were evident signs of a rushed production. Whedon simply did not have the time for the attention to detail  he obviously brought to each \\"Firefly\\" production. More's the pity. But for the time and budget he did have, Whedon did an admirable job that well rewarded his \\"Firefly\\" fans. And Joss finally got to show us the edgier, darker Mal he originally envisioned as Captain Reynolds.  <br /> <br />Since the movie lacked time for the clever nuances of character and humor that richly graced the series, I fear the wonderful character of Kaylee may have came off to the uninitiated as little more than a bitter whiner. Her's was the most neglected role in the movie, failing to do her memorable characterization of the perky ship's mechanic justice. And, of course, we didn't get near enough of Book. <br /> <br />In point of fact, it just wasn't possible for the movie to give starved fanseverything they wanted. That would have necessitated a twelve hour movie with properly fleshed out characters and not a single scene or line of dialogue left out.  <br /> <br />Over time, I have come to question Whedon's judgement on the need to kill off a major character, much less two. Not only did he destroy one of the most interesting couples relationships ever portrayed on screen, he deprived future stories of Wash's folksie warmth - a trait that balanced the sometimes overtly hard lines of other characters. And Ron Glass's \\"Shepherd Book\\" certainly deserved a longer shelf life. <br /> <br />We may never see a \\"Firefly\\" series again - one that reflects the same attention to detail as the first, that fills in the timeline between the last show and the movie. It's cancelation makes the drivel endlessly offered up in CableWorld all the more mystifying. SciFi Channel is now broadcasting \\"Passions,\\" but not scrambling for rights to give \\"Firefly\\" a second shot?!? Space monkeys obviously run the corporate end of television. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, moviegoers who never viewed the complete \\"Firefly\\" series were deprived of a full understanding of Whedon's characters. \\"Serenity\\" gave you a decent idea of \\"who,\\" but failed to fully deliver a sufficient \\"why.\\"  <br /> <br />That being said, I watched \\"Serenity\\" twice the weekend it opened and again the following weekend. I have subsequently viewed my widescreen DVD version of the movie many times over. Never has \\"Serenity\\" failed to deliver an uncommonly enjoyable experience.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd is one of the greatest, ahead of their time bands to ever come into music. You don't have to be a drug addict to appreciate them. Dark Side is such an amazing album. Even the title bleeds creativity and mystery. That's what is so wonderful about this album is the mystery behind everything. You just feel like there is something in the background you're missing...it's very persausive.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I'm hard to impress, and this film is gorgeous, smart, and nearly perfect in every possible way.  See it, but make sure to watch it with subtitles, 'cause the dubbed version is rediculous.
B000062XM7|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis is a fine actor and<br /><br />this is the best movie he ever did!<br /><br />The most beatifully filmed movie of<br /><br />the year. The author of 'Scalp Dance'<br /><br />was wrong about this movie. Plus he's<br /><br />a racist!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I will say that, aside from carey elwes and that other guy's performances (the photographer), this movie is really good and is actually pretty scary. One of the best endings in a long time, too, maybe since the Sixth Sense, and it was nice to see Danny Glover in a creepy role for a change. It's too bad it's now going to have 30 sequels and will become a complete joke. I hate hollywood.
B00097DX3U|1.0|The material on this record is just flat out weak. At least the last album had a couple of promising songs, but would it kill Tom Morello to use the dirty channel on his amp once in a while? There is practically no distortion on this album...and these guys use to be RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE.  <br /> <br />This album has Chris Cornell's wimpy adult contemporary writing all over it. I wonder if they often take a break from playing to count their money during intermissions at shows.
B00004RJ74|4.0|Quentin Tarrantino promised us a \\"horror film for horror fans.\\"  He lied.  It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, but it is a fun movie.  I gotta say, the first half is really, really good, but it gets a little lame when the vampires show up, but it's still one of those movies you can watch over and over.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles show why they are still popular after all of these years.  They sing their old favorites as well as some new songs, and they sound really great.  Joe Walsh sings a song called \\"One Day At A Time which sends a real positive message and is a great song.  If you like great music, you need to buy this DVD.
0307276902|3.0|First person accounts of severe personal trauma are only entertaining if the person telling the story is sharp and unusual. Frey certainly seems like a difficult person, but he doesn't have the take on his experiences that makes Augusten Burrough's 'Dry' so entertaining. As I read this rough-hewn, cautionary tale, I kept thinking that its literal quality would make it an excellent subject for a parody . . . it reads like Voltaire's Candide. Frey does not have a lot of poetry in his soul.  <br /> <br />What James Frey does have is the mother of all addiction recovery stories and the desire to make it even better. His desire to tell a harsh, deadpan story at a fast pace produces some poignant and entertaining moments. His descriptions can be winningly graphic, sometimes even a little surreal. I think that appeals to readers of horrific memoirs.   <br /> <br />The bad news is that some of his descriptions do not ring true and worse, in my opinon, sometimes the decriptions are painfully flat and unimaginative. Frey relies on a lot of contemporary fiction techniques: short sentences, repetition, stream-of-conciousness interjections, but these little pacing tricks don't make up for the author's lack of distance, insight and material.  <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Judging from this CD, she deserves every ego-boosting title given by the media (not that what they say really matters anyway) Madonna, I love your music so much. Please come to Toronto again when you world-tour. I bet you know Toronto loves you to death.
1400031087|5.0|This is a great book and an excellent piece of storytelling. It does not claim to be a self-help guide. It is one person's story. The idea that it is supposed to be a memoir makes it even more entertaining. I don't expect every word of it to be true and neither should anyone else.  <br /> <br />Read the book and judge it for yourself as a piece of entertainment.  Each individual can decide whether or not to believe everything he or she reads (or in this case everything Oprah recommends). <br /> <br />This whole idea of adding a disclaimer to the book is ridiculous. So, every book should now say \\"WARNING: SOME OF THIS MAY BE MADE UP SO IT SOUNDS BETTER\\"??  <br /> <br />I have a better warning: <br /> <br />WARNING: BELIEVE EVERYTHING AT YOUR OWN RISK <br /> <br />Why are people so shocked that some things that were supposed to be true were made up? What about every book about Nostradamus? Fad diet books? Alien abduction? They all claim to be true and there is no need for a disclaimer there. <br /> <br />Two words for everyone: Critical Thinking. <br /> <br />

B0009IW88A|5.0|As a dynamic soundtrack collector, I must say that Batman Begins is one of my all time favorite scores. With the combination of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, how could anything go wrong? <br />The score is dark, scary, beautiful, and full of action all at the same time. It has awesome synthetic base added to some songs which I happen to love very much.  <br />IT SHOULD BE UP FOR SCORE OF THE YEAR, THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF HOW GOOD IT IS. WHEN I SAW THE LIST AND THIS WAS NOT ON IT I YELLED AND CURSED THE OSCAR IDIOTS. THEN I GLANCED DOWN TO NOTICE THAT NEITHER KING KONG, STAR WARS, BATMAN BEGINS, HARRY POTTER, NOR THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA WAS ON IT.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|['] I grew up in that era were as Michael says sexes were pidgon holed. This story hits me hard and to the point of emotional exhaustion. I have seen it 12 times and the last night it played I saw it back to back I wish it would stay on the big screen forever because the DVD on TV will not give the wide scope the background that helps in creating the whole story. My message to people who are turned off by two men in love is to ignore the sex of the characters and Listen To The Story. The STORY can affect everyone differently and I wish they would see it for the story line. I lost control one night after seeing it<br />. When I got home I fell apart and could not even stand up. It can be a very emotional film and is a very emotional film. Especially those who grew up in that era. I was 2 years younger than Ennis and Jack so it hits home. ['] There are no words to express how I love this masterpiece of film. ['] I still get very emotional over the movie and the soundtrack.

B000002GQE|5.0|Everything you read about the sheer beauty of this wonderful album is completely true.  If you have never heard it, you are missing out on seminal art rock at its finest.  Having said that, the remaster was totally unnecessary becuase the orig. CD releases on Deram/London were outstanding and the remasters cannot touch them.  The better your equipment, the more you can tell how how much warmer the original version is compared to the remaster.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have astounded me again with this amazing CD. From the first 3 chords to the last 3 notes, it is filled with wonderful melodies, lyrics, teamwork and just  outstanding talent. I would definetely recommend this CD to anybody, new or old Chili Pepper fan. Awesome!
0307276902|5.0|Even with all of the controversy over this book as to whether it is true or only partially true I can say that this book was a good read.  I can say from experience that what Mr. Frey has written about as far as the addiction and recovery is very true.  Whether or not the people are real, well who knows.  I really enjoyed reading the book - it reminded me of the hell that comes with addiction - which is something people who have fought the demon and won the battle tend to forget over time.  It took me back to what now seems like a lifetime ago.  It made me very grateful for what I now have.
B000002H70|5.0|Ok - so I remember vividly sitting in my room unrapping my brand new cassette - sitting so close to the sterio so I didn't miss a single note - CRAP!  I got the you-know-what scared out of me when the first note of PLAINSONG blared out of the speaker! :) That was the defining moment - the moment I knew this was the album I was waiting my whole life to hear!  I grew up listening to old punk, old \\"gothic\\" and basically any \\"alternative\\" music I could get my hands on.  But there was always a passion for The Cure.  This album might have been the one to \\"mainstream\\" this band - but it is only one of numerous Cure albums that are essential to my well-being!  This one, however, is amazing from start to finish - so much emotion that I can sit there and feel the passion, excitement, love, hurt and happiness echoed in every note of every song.  So much so that I have to listen over and over again.  How many albums can have that kind of influence on someone?  Of course there are albums that involk memories, feelings, emotions, etc. for everyone - I would say probably every song you have ever heard in your life has some kind of memory folded into it - but this one imparticular is filled with so many YEARS of memories it's amazing.  I am sure everyone who has this or has at least listened to it from beginning to end can tell me where they were when they heard it for the first time.  Wow - I can't say enough to even remotely give this album the credit it deserves.  I guess all I can say is PERFECT
B0007PAMR4|5.0|After years of anticipation I finally have it.  I am very pleased.  The tin box that the DVD is in is gorgeous. The printing on the front and back is very well done with good use of the underlying substrate as backing color.  The bulk of the packaging money must have gone to this box, because there are really no liner notes or anything cool on the inside besides the DVD. <br /> <br />The DVD features two different versions of the film. The theatrical 'David Lynch' version, and the extended version put together very \\"NON LYNCH-ESQUE\\" by the producers. Although the Extended version is longer with scenes not in the original, there are original scenes cut out of the extended version.  Little things.  Like the more prolonged scenes of the Baron Harkkonen and other grotesqueries that we have come to love from David Lynch.  The \\"Alan Smithee\\" version obviously thought these little nuances weren't important.  And the scenes in the extended version are often drawn out and include awkward silences and clumsy delivery of dialogue. <br /> <br />So guess what?  the Original is better, but it's nice to have these extra scenes, and the SPECIAL FEATURES are great too. There are two featurettes for behind the scenes junkies to enjoy. <br /> <br />I'm so glad this is finally available.
B0002858YS|4.0|I don't do this review thing normally, but I have to say this album has some of the best bass & drum sounds that I have heard in a long time.  Jenny Was A Friend of Mine and All These Things That I've Done are fantastic.  I LOVE Everything Will Be Alright - dare I say that almost reminds me of some sort of psychedelic Beatles song with some Joy Division tossed in??? - Anyway - I'm no writer, so I will spare you any more of my blah - this is a great album, I can't wait for their sophmore release -
B000AMJDHY|5.0|First and foremost, I don.t like to label every band I come across. I.ve seen a few people call them \\"emo\\" and if that.s true...at least they do it differently. They have a very bouncy beat and infectious lyrics and melodies.  <br /> <br />I.m not gonna rate every track on the album but I will say that any Chuck Palahniuk fan will like the song Time to Dance for it.s nod to Invisible Monsters.  <br /> <br />In MY opinion...a great Cd that was definitely worth my money. Give it a try.
B00005JO1P|3.0|I grew up in the country on a farm in N.S.W.  Australia and as a child of 7 years of age, on of my first recollections of music in and around the home was that of a one Mr Johnny Cash.Well folks I am now 42 years old, a musician and still very much in awe of the Man In Black, no one had a voice like him and he was an amazing storyteller and songwriter. With the exception of maybe Mr Hank Williams, Mr J Cash is in a league  of his own, as one of the most unique singers to ever emerge from the American C&W  scene.With that said Walk the Line, the James Mangold directed Johnny Cash bio-pic was released nationally today in Australia. Of course I wasted no time in making it to the first session available,whilst overall I was not completely dissapointed I just felt that this film seemed to lack that special magic.You know, that  something that makes you want to see a great film over and over again (regardless of the films genre). I must also mention here that  I have worked in the video/dvd rental business for over 10 years and I love watching and talking about movies.And as much as a Johnny Cash fan as I am, I just can't say that I love this film about one off my all time musical hereos.I just felt that at times, Mangold (DIR) played in safe in the usual Hollywood way  and made a typical flick by the numbers, so as not to get his Hollywood bosses breathing down his back.This film reminded me very much of Great Balls of Fire,the Jerry Lee Lewis bio-pic with a very inspiring performance by  Dennis Quade as the killer.And just like that film, Walk the Line barely touches the surface of what both these great performers were all about. I must say though, in all fairness, it would probably take amost an entire lifetime just to tell Johnny Cash's story.So in nutshell, what I personally think went wrong with this film is some overly heavy handed directing and some equally heavy handed editing. I genuinly feel that the film suffers for these compromises, a tougher director (would have loved to have seen what Scorsese or Gus van Sant may have acheived)may have fought harder for his/her film to be made and cut the way they wanted it.Who know's,its all speculation anyway,thats enough rambling lets get  onto the review. Phoenix's performance of the Man in black is stellar and incendiary, you really get the feeling he has pulled out all stops to walk a mile(or better still walk the line) in the great mans shoes.Although he never really looks exactly like JC, except for maybe  when Johnny was young, he has enough of the great man's Cashism's down, to help make the character convincing and real enough.While it comes as no surprise, Reese Witherspoon does an amazing job of playing June Carter Cash, the often overshadowed offsping of  America's answer to country music's royal family, the Carter's. Witherspoon has been a rock solid performer over the span of her career so far and is equally adept as an actress at playing light and fluffy roles such as Legally Blonde, to playing a pyschotic, sex crazed student ,running for school president in the excellent, Election.So as you can see by most other reviews posted here, it's not the actors performances that let this film down so much but maybe a more behind the scenes problem.The soundtrack is great with musical direction coming from Mr T Bone Burnette so he knows what he is doing,this includes all the incidental tracks that he has chosen as well, to match the periods etc. Once again personally for me, it  was (she really did look like she was playing the autoharp? I'm still not sure)Witherspoon's singing voice that was stronger and it won me over more than Phoenix's effort.In all fairness though, Phoenix's singing was still credible and to try and impersonate one of the most unique voices on the planet is a tall order for anyone,my hat still goes of to him.This probably explains why there are so many  Elvis impersonators and so very few Johnny Cash ones, so far in Ausatralia I have never seen a JohnnyCash impersonator.Special mention must also go to Robert (Terminator 2)Patrick for getting to play the father of not one, but two off the biggest names in the music business, in such a short space of time.Remember him  as Elvis's dad in the recent made for television Presley Estate approved bio-pic, I found this quite amusing, almost like they had cast him on purpose as the worst inside joke of bio-pic history.So to sum up if you loved Johnny Cash chances are you will find more to like about this film than to dislike and if your like me you'll probably be left a little wanting.As far as bio-pic's go this one plays pretty hard and fast  down the middle of the road, so as not to alienate everyone that isn't a  Johnny Cash fan or for that matter a fan of country music.Also of note I must give mention to the stunning costumes and set direction,they have done an excellent job and it is a real treat for all you hardcore retrophiles and atomic stylists. I will still buy this on DVD when relesed,as well as the soundtrack, I have no doubt that the DVD will be stacked with so many extras, that it will  more than make up for a lot of the films shortcomings.Finally on a lighter note there are two kinds of people when it comes to country and western music those that hate it and those that really hate it.Enjoy the movie folks and I hope all this inept rambling will be of  use too some off the people out there.Cash impersonator.Special mention must also go to Robert (Terminator 2)Patrick for getting to play the father of not one, but two off the biggest names in the music business, in such a short space of time.Remember him  as Elvis's dad in the recent made for television Presley Estate approved bio-pic, I found this quite amusing, almost like they had cast him on purpose as the worst inside joke of bio-pic history.So to sum up if you loved Johnny Cash chances are you will find more to like about this film than to dislike and if your like me you'll probably be left a little wanting.As far as bio-pic's go this one plays pretty hard and fast  down the middle of the road, so as not to alienate everyone that isn't a  Johnny Cash fan or for that matter a fan of country music.Also of note I must give mention to the stunning costumes and set direction,they have done an excellent job and it is a real treat for all you hardcore retrophiles and atomic stylists.

B000002QWD|5.0|This album conjurs up memories of every Christmas of my childhood, and it literally is not Christmas without hearing it at least once. I am 47, but have always loved Bing, ever since my dad and I listened to him years ago. My dad is gone now, but listening to this album brings him back to me again. I love White Christmas because it always sounds new to me, no matter how many times I hear it, and all the songs with the Andrews Sisters are great - instantly sets the time and place when they were recorded. Dated? Yes, it is, but then so am I, and I love these songs more each year! Bing really was the Voice of Christmas.
B00005O5CM|4.0|You can push people only so far before they begin to fight back.  When this movie was made, blondes were one of the few groups left in America that it was safe to bash, belittle and discriminate against.  Someone decided enough was enough.      The woman they selected to lead the fight could not have been better chosen.  Reese Witherspoon had already played characters that, whatever else they might be, were not ones to take any crap from anybody.  Reese played Elle with all the vulnerability, all the tender-heartedness that a real Elle would have; but when it came to getting what she wanted, she was prepared to go a long way, even if it meant buying a computer (Ugh!) and going to law school (Double-ugh!).      But a strange thing happened along the way.  Elle discovered that she was not as dumb as she thought she was.  She could compete with the best of them and still keep her own values.  By the end of this journey, Elle (and the viewer) has learned that sometimes what or who you wanted wasn't as great as you thought he was, and you can do a lot better, because now you are more capable, more knowledgeable, and smarter than you were a few years before.      The filmmakers obviously didn't want to be so uncool as to take sides, so there is still a lot of blonde bashing in this movie; but there are moments that are funny, moments that are touching, and an ending that is satisfying.      Reese Witherspoon became a mega-star with this movie, and she wasn't one to quit either.  She started her own production company, put up the money to make Legally Blonde 2 and continues to be a major Hollywood star.  In a poll on [...] Reese was voted the most popular actress of 2005.
B00005JMXX|3.0|...The moral stand point at the core of this film is at the very least worthy if a little overplayed. It hits hard with two weighty political themes not necessarily readily embraced by western governments or indeed the wests affluent populations. One theme, Global warming as a result of reckless waste, is very prevailant, at times to the point of annoyance.<br /><br />The closing addition of the west's gratitude and sorrow for past misdemeanour to the \\"third world\\" is paid such scant reference it could very easily be overlooked, one cannot help but to wonder if it is thinly disguised, anti-Bush comment.<br /><br /> Generally such films are viewed for their special effects, which here are stunning and do not dissapoint (save for some rather ropey looking escaped wolves which border on disneyesque!).<br /><br /> The actors are generally speaking, understudies to the action in such films, but here there is the added bonus of Jake Gyllenhaal who plays his role (the troubled genius kid) with more credence than the average display. He resists the temptation to be bullish and sensitively progresses from disillusioned teenager to thoughtful young men. A testament to his thespian skill as we witness in some of his earlier roles and many of latter ones (Donnie Darko, The Good Girl, Brokeback Mountain, Jarhead etc), unfortunately it is a rather wasted effort in this film.<br /><br />Quaid is stoic and masterful but a little lost, you need to see the the man in \\"Far from Heaven\\" to truly witness his impact. Ward is credible as the heroic Dr/Wife/Mother if a little over-emotional and other than a plastic and irrtaing performance by Chapman, as the girl love interest for Gyllenhaal, (I almost hoped her septicaemia would be fatal!), the cast just dissapear in the face of the unlikely but sobering special effects.<br /><br /> My only other comment would be to watch the film in summer if you don't wish to be tooth-chatteringly frozen by it's conclusion!
B000001GX8|4.0|This version is extremely accurate in terms of singing and Edith Mathis' voice is one of the best I heard in my life, in fact, her singing is perfect in terms of accuracy. <br />Dietrich Fisher Dieskau's voice is characteristic of the well-trained german: powerful, vivid, dramatic. <br />Gundula Janowitz's voiceis also quite good, but not at the same level of the other singers. <br />In terms of beauty and melody, these singers have reached the top, however they aren't very dramatic, and they could improve quite a bit in that aspect. <br />On the whole, I'd say this is a very good interpretation, but not the best in the world, in fact I'd say that there isn't any, for every interpretation has one or two flaws. For those who like gorgeously melodious voices this is a must, but for those who tend to go for the dramatic side this is a maybe not, thus I 'm witholding my five and giving four stras to this recording. <br />
B000B7BRMM|1.0|I've always thought of Diana Krall as a sellout. I've been told that she was not a singer by choice, that record execs saw dollar signs and \\"encouraged\\" this mediocre pianist to sing. They were lucky that Krall has a nice voice quality and sings in tune, and can swing in a very middle of the road, 2 levels above white bread kind of way. But as a performer, she comes off as an emotionless robot. Her overall delivery is a droning monotone. Every song is performed the same way, in a husky, lilting, and ultimately boring as hell manner.  <br />Since Norah Jones has effectively blown Krall out of the water in terms of sales, what could they think of as a comeback? How bout a Christmas album! Nothing says sellout like Christmas. And I actually like some of those songs, but to be honest, I'd rather sit around and sing them with my friends than listen to Krall sleepwalk through this set of traditional tunes. In fact, I'd rather go Christmas Caroling in the Gaza Strip than listen to this unimaginative, boring, lifeless collection of performances.  <br />OK, maybe I'm being too harsh. But once a tool, always a tool. Krall is too much part of the machine, so if she did have an original idea, I doubt there would be anyone in the company that would let her try it.  <br />Some the arrangements on this disc have nice orchestration, but overall sound very functional, commercial, and bland. Which fit perfectly with Krall's bland delivery. Even when she tries to emote on Mel Torme's great composition \\" The Christmas Song\\", it sounds disingenuine.  <br />I think of Diana Krall as a product. When a business school grad goes to work at a corporation, they come in with profit as their goal. So whatever product they want to market and sell to the American public, and hopefully the World market, they want to have the most widespread appeal possible. Diana Krall is the Coca Cola Sugar Water of music. Sugary Sweet, a buxom blond with very little nutrition or substance in her artistry. But the vast public wants a CD, i mean, product, that they can put on at a dinner party and basically talk over and say, \\" We love jazz! Here's our Diana Krall CD.\\" <br />Diana's pose on the front cover says it all. Pretty and all dressed up but just lays there lifeless. It's almost a pose of defeat. Even sellouts have their limits.
B00005JOM9|5.0|Transamerica tells the story of Bree, a pre-op transsexual woman, who learns -- just one week before her operation -- that she fathered a son 17 years ago. Her psychologist refuses to authorize the operation until she deals with this one last piece of her past so Bree reluctantly flies to New York to get to know her son, Toby. She bails him out of jail and then, learning that he wants to go to Los Angeles to find his father, she hopes to help him and herself by driving him to California. Throughout their journey, Bree struggles to keep the fact that she is Toby's father from him while at the same time trying to become closer to him, eventually becoming the strong woman she always knew she could be. A touching and very human movie about family, filled with much humor and sensitivity. Duncan Tucker's script is flawless and lays out the universal struggles of all families: communication, unconditional love, rebellion against parents, being true to one's self. Felicity Huffman's portrayal of Bree is remarkable. She brings much dignity to her character and allows the audience to see beyond what the eyes see into the heart of her character. Kevin Zegers gives a fine performance as Toby, struggling to find his own identity in the world.  This is a carefully crafted film filled with fine performances -- I can't forget to throw in Graham Greene, Fionnula Flannagan and Burt Young -- and a touching story about family and discovering your true self.
0143036556|5.0|This book takes you on a dizzy ride around the globe and through history. You meander in and out of ancient and modern civilzations. The author's discussions of greed and elite power are intriguing.  I highly recommend this book.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I heard from some close friends that 50 Cent's latest album The Massacre wasn't all that great, and I really wasn't that surprised because I picked up Eminem's album Encore and, well, if Em delivers a wack album, then there's really not much hope for anyone else on Shady/Aftermath.<br /><br />As other people have mentioned, a major problem with this album is the production. One reviewer said that more Dr. Dre-produced tracks would have helped the album, but I don't know about that because Dre does slip in the beat department on here, like on \\"Gunz Come Out\\". And although I never actually heard the remix of \\"Outta Control\\" with Mobb Deep, I'm not sure I want to because the regular version is bad enough already, especially because the beat sounds like a bad reworking of Busta Rhymes' \\"Fire\\" (and THAT was a bad beat to begin with). Hi-Tek also slips on \\"Ryder Music\\", whose beat sounds like it came from a drum machine.<br /><br />But the biggest problem of all is the lyrics. As much as I like Get Rich or Die Tryin', it's true that Fiddy never really was THE great lyricist. And that is especially shown on the many female-oriented tracks, especially the two most overrated ones, \\"Candy Shop\\" (which used to be called \\"Magic Stick\\") and \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\". What's really ridiculous about the latter is how the tone of it keeps switching abruptly, not to mention the second verse when it says: \\"Heard she bisexual, she f wit' that girl/But boy oh boy, f'n wit' me is a whole `nother world.\\" Boy oh boy??? How old is he?<br /><br />The rest of the love songs go from corny (\\"Just a Lil Bit\\" -- and it's censored for some reason) to just plain stupid (\\"Get In My Car\\"). The only song like that that really works is \\"Disco Inferno\\" (even though it sounds a little too much like Lloyd Banks' \\"On Fire\\"). But I'm not exactly sure why the song has 50 proclaiming how good Dre's drums are when Dre only did the mixing for it, not the production. Anyway, that still can't overlook weak choruses in songs like \\"God Gave Me Style\\" and \\"Ski Mask Way\\".<br /><br />The only other songs that really stand out on here are \\"Position of Power\\", \\"In My Hood\\" and the remix of Game's \\"Hate It or Love It\\"; trouble is, they're all scattered about on this 77-minute mess of an album. As far as The Massacre, well, he said it; I didn't.<br /><br />Anthony Rupertchoruses in songs like \\"God Gave Me Style\\" and \\"Ski Mask Way\\". <br /> <br />The only other songs that really stand out on here are \\"Position of Power\\", \\"In My Hood\\" and the remix of Game's \\"Hate It or Love It\\"; trouble is, they're all scattered about on this 77-minute mess of an album.

B000002UYZ|5.0|The people here who think if this was just one CD, we would save a few bucks need to wise up. CD's  cost PENNIES to press, what costs the money is the royalties of the songs. 1 CD or 2 CD would make little diffrence as the royalty payments whould be the same, you'd save 50 cents at the most, get a weaker cd case, and only one cd, crammed with 20 plus tracks, so any stracthes will cause more dmagae to the album as a whole. Quit while your ahead people. 26 classics, one great double collection....
0307276902|2.0|i found this book very engaging because it was labeled a memoir but after the author admitted that he lied about the contents of the book, I must say that had I known that the events were made up, I would not have found them as gripping.  I am also personally disappointed that he felt he had to mislabel his book.  As a work of fiction, it's not very compelling.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never knew about this show until I mentioned to my son I was going to see Serenity in the theater.  He told me it was based on the Firefly series.  I can't figure out how I missed it.  I love SciFi and watch Fox shows often.  (Marketing missed the boat.)  I liked Serenity so much that I got all 4 Firefly discs from Netflix.  Wow!  How could they think of cancelling this series?  It's intelligent, rich in characters and locations, laugh-out-loud clever and I'm sooo hooked.  I am buying the collection today.  Bring it back!
B000002UAO|4.0|Like so many fans, I prefer the sequence of the US version, which has become almost a mini rock opera in its own right, fitting together like \\"tommy\\" or \\"pepper\\".  It was one of Capitol's unintended consequences. Rubber soul does not work without \\"I've just seen a face\\" or with \\"Nowhere Man\\", which for US listeners belongs in the consciousness of mid-1966 not late 1965 (musically there is a world of difference). There is nothing I can say that has not already been said about this album.  Pundits say that it was a beginning of a new softer, drug influenced era for the Band. Others say it was the end of the teeny bopper phase. Both true, but... as someone who was around in 1965 as a very young kid, I noticed that shortly after I got this treasured album as birthday present, many elders started listening to it - in a serious way.  We didn't know it then but that marked the time when the Beatles had arrived as serious, credible artists. You cannot be a part of civilization without this particular piece of music.  Star deducted for UK version only.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|For a majority of it's running time, the Bourne Supremacy excells above the Bourne Identity, with Matt Damon reprising his role as the amnesiac CIA assassin, who is once again on the run after being framed for murder.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles return as well, and Joan Allen is a welcome addition as a CIA handler trying to make sense of the conspiracy web that Bourne is tangled in.  While the action sequences are superbly done, and Damon is great as well as Bourne, the film suffers from the shaky camera work by director Paul Greengrass.  Now this may not be a huge problem for some, but there will be those who will find this utterly annoying.  Not to mention that the film itself bears little resemblance to Robert Ludlum's original work, and the dispatching of Franka Potente's character is disappointing as well, but the Bourne Supremacy gets more right than it does wrong.  All in all, the Bourne Supremacy is a more than solid mainstream action/espionage adaptation that, and if there are more films on the way, then this could be the start of something good.
0525948023|5.0|I am so GLAD! that Eckhart has finally written a book that goes to the core of the matter here. The ego. I am reading his new book with great interest, as I did all of his previous publications, and maybe it is just me but this one seems to be devoid of the wash of liberated presence that his last ones contained. Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining in the least for I see now that the search for enlightenment has been so muddled up with feeling states, that we seekers have gotten lost along the way... or in other words, the ego has been trying to get enlightened!! LOL  <br /> <br />Eckharts works reminds me of another teacher I 'bumped into' over in EU very recently who is working on a book about ego that is in a very similar vein. (Power and Grace - The Four Steps of Evolving Consciousness) <br />This work is all about dissecting the ego. Here is a clip that shows again that the issue is really to recognize the ego and then disconnect from it. <br /> <br />'The incidence of spontaneous right-action, your expression of potential and how you tolerate the events of your life are directly proportional to how you relate to the content of your mind. Your upbringing and then the media train you to pay attention to the presence of thoughts and feelings as being a significant representation of who you are. You then label this mind-clutter as knowledge, opinions, beliefs, fears, desires, doubts, understandings, superstitions, and judgments, and sum it all up into a blanket definition that is generally referred to as me. From the awakened perspective, the actions comprising what is commonly termed a normal life become a product of the preservation and protection of this self-image, the picture you have concocted of yourself from ions of individual and global conditioning from the past. Is your life a cause to spend and defend this mirage of me? <br /> <br />Spontaneous right-action on the other hand is the innate ability to execute a course of accomplishment free from theperception of the past. Such responses result from an authentic inquiry into the effects conditioning has on your process of thinking. Cognition is the mistress of ego, so recognizing the pimp and how it operates in your life facilitates the appearance of spontaneous right-action. <br /> <br />This begins by being sensitive to the arising of thoughts as a mechanical and meaningless process of healthy mind. Simply because a thought is present in your awareness does not automatically imply significance. Understanding that thoughts are born harmless, and focusing instead on who you are in relationship to their benevolent birth, develops awakened attention to thought. By paying awakened attention to thought you will begin to experience the first signs of spontaneous right-action.' <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Yeah, that's best word to describe me when I purchased this CD from here. Never in a million years had I imagined I would buy a Madonna product. I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. Madonna has a warm soothing voice and her beat is wicked. Never mind some lyrics. We don't have to be deep and thoughtful 24/7, do we? My preferred tracks are Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry and Forbidden Love. Oh, I happen to like Isaac too.

B00000K0E5|4.0|Pierce Brosnan proves he is the second-best James Bond ever in his first (1995) outing as 007 in GOLDENEYE. Besides being Brosnan's first Bond film, GOLDENEYE was also the first Bond film not to use an Ian Fleming title (though \\"Goldeneye\\" was the name of Fleming's Jamaica estate, so it goes not too far afield). GOLDENEYE also marks the first appearance of Dame Judi Dench as \\"M\\" (still a stern, no-nonsense boss) and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny. Desmond Llewelyn reprises \\"Q.\\" Joe Don Baker and Robbie Coltrane round out the cast of good guys as a somewhat bumpkinesque CIA agent and a hearty Russian Mafia man.<br /><br />Sean Bean plays Janus, a former MI-6 agent gone turncoat whose master plan is to make himself fabulously wealthy by short-circuiting  all of London's financial and property records using \\"Goldeneye,\\" a hijacked Russian space weapon to do the job.  His chief ally is Xenia Onatopp (the drop-dead gorgeous Famke Janssen) whose trademark assassination technique is to smother men between her legs. (Yes, you read that right.)<br /><br />Janus' plan begins to go awry when a technician, Natalia Semenova (the lovely Italian model/actress Izabella Scorupco) survives the Goldeneye hijack and manages to elude Janus' minions long enough to meet up with Bond. GOLDENEYE then becomes a series of hyperactive large-scale set-piece pyrotechnic battles during which the unflappable Bond has to do little more than shoot, quip, and straighten his tie. Luckily, Brosnan is up for it, playing Bond with an understated Conneryesque cool that never deserts him. Brosnan, an Irish-born actor who claims the first film he ever saw in the cinema was GOLDFINGER, was made for this role. It is a shame he missed being Bond sooner, courtesy of his contract on REMINGTON STEELE.<br /><br />The film slides into excess at times (the extended car chase between a Mercedes and a Russian tank is a bit too much), but the storyline is good enough to keep GOLDENEYE from degenerating into a cinematic migraine headache. Unfortunately, Eon Productions seems stuck on the idea that if a small-scale Hiroshima doesn't happen at least once every two minutes in a Bond film then the audience might fall asleep.<br /><br />Fortunately, they are the only ones in GOLDENEYE who are stuck. The dynamics between Bond and Janus as former friends are intriguing, the women are gorgeous, the comedy is well-paced, and the locations (the newly-minted capitalist Russia, and Cuba) are appropriately exotic. In short, this film saved the franchise.<br /><br />There is a real shortage of gadgets in GOLDENEYE. The Bond car (a BMW) is truly forgettable, primarily because the actual model wasn't ready for the film and a mock-up had to be used. However, the film does open with Bond driving the Aston-Martin DB-5, a direct visual link to the Connery films. Why he just didn't use it throughout is a mystery answerable by the words \\"contract\\" and \\"product placement.\\"<br /><br />Brosnan, although he of course orders his martinis \\"shaken and not stirred\\" never gets to comment on the caviar or the wine list, a regrettable oversight. His casino time is likewise limited. The Bond franchise desperately needs to rediscover style, a key to uniqueness in our grubby era. (Is anybody listening?) However, Bond IS referred to as a \\"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\\" and \\"a relic of the Cold War\\" in this film, so there's still hope left in the world.tic migraine headache.

0380789035|5.0|American Gods doesn't really fit into any genre per-se. I wondered if to group it in fantasy would be difficult. It was. Then I wondered if science fiction would do. No, no luck there, either. Thriller, perhaps, but that didn't seem work, either. It's almost as if Gaiman has formed a genre of his own making here. That's worth getting out of the way first and foremost, if not anything else.<br /><br />The plot, though, centers around Shadow, a man about to be released from prison to go home to his beautiful wife and work at his best friend's \\"Muscle Farm.\\" Complications arise on the plane ride there, when a mysterious man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday greets him with a job opportunity that he learns later would be difficult to refuse. And then the storm begins...<br /><br />This is a novel about ideas, about ideas personified, and they are characters, fictional--but with the help of Mr. Gaiman's poetic prose--moving characters. Everything has a personality all its own, rather it be the environments Gaiman paints for his reader, or the eccentric, engaging characters themselves. Shadow in particular is not a mere bundle of static. No, he is dynamic beyond anything, and Gaiman uses patience and a lot of time to craft his character, developing him with a care for precision.<br /><br />The novel is astonishing because it's one of those rare gems that says something very spontaneous and generally accepted by people, but it's something that's usually not examined: the idea of ideas as people. This review may be confusing, and at first so is the novel, but for fear of revealing important things, I'm being careful.<br /><br />It is a page turner, certainly (I would read until the early morning and then sleep until late afternoon, only to wake up and open the book again), but it's much more than that. It's about the beliefs we hold and about the ones we let go, and it's about customs struggling to fit once again into a society that doesn't accept their cultural relevance. It is about how these ideas have shaped everything and everybody, and how the world wouldn't be the way it is now without those ideas there. Religions and cultures; they fade into oblivion and new ones arise to take their place, only so they can fall and then the cycle repeats. Again and again this happens, and that is what this novel says. But don't take it only from me. Read it for yourself, and you should see.<br /><br />It's worth noting, of course, that Gaiman has a proper knowledge of the myths and legends that went into the making of this book, and although I can't lay claim to the ability for giving in-depth accounts of the cultures on which he writes, or the ideas of the past on which he communicates poetically, it comes across fictionally, readably, and it works well for his subject matter.

B000AXSN5G|4.0|Neil Young has gone through all kinds of phases over the years.  He's had some misses and duds and gotten off track now and again, but when he's good, as he is, with a couple of exceptions here, he's really, really good. <br /> <br />The reason he continues to be one of the most influential musicians on the planet is that there's a consistency and intensity in spite of some of the misses.  <br /> <br />A couple of days after 9/11, he chose to cover John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\".  It couldn't have been a more appropriate choice.  His protest spirit continues on \\"When God made me\\", which he chose to play for the Katrina benefit recently.  The artists had been told specifically not to say anything political in the wake of Kanye West's \\"Bush doesn't like black people\\" comment. <br /> <br />Well, for those who listened to \\"When God made me\\", Neil managed to stick it to the crusading war mongers anyway. <br /> <br />Jonathan Demme filmed Neil doing this album in its entirety at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville just after it was finished.  Something to look forward to. <br /> <br />
B000002P5W|5.0|This is without question the best record ever made by anyone. you get EVERY THING! Hendrix was the only man who could go from strait swing, to classic rock sound in two songs. Little wing has become the standard for musicians every where. mitch michell is killer, and noel redding is awsome through the whole record. if you dont own this you should be kicked in the head

1591396190|5.0|The authors make their points clear and easily applicable in  everyday business.  They've provided real-world examples and stories in order to drive their findings straight through and I must say, it has completely changed my approach to my business and my clients are profiting like crazy.  I highly recommend this book as it is now one of my most prized resources.

B00062ZE3U|5.0|If you love Evanescence you will love Within Temptation, too.<br /><br />AMAZING.  Absolutely thrilled I got this CD.  I'm always looking for music that is long lasting.  This one got to me right away & will be listened to a lot over the years to come.  Thank You So Much...!!!
B00005JMJG|5.0|Off the bat, I typically can only tolerate so much Jim Carrey.  But I loved Adaptation, and the premise of this film, that one could, for a fee, erase painful relationship memories, and continue living as though a person never came into our lives, intrigued me.  And this may be Jim Carrey's best role: it's more serious, but it also allows him just enough room to \\"be Jim.\\"  By the end, you will really ask yourself three questions: 1) Given the chance, would you consider erasing someone from your memory?  2) Really?  Remember: they're entirely gone.  and 3) If you could go back in time, back to that moment where you first met this person, knowing in advance how the relationship would turn out, would you make the same choice you made the first time?  <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B0007CNXUU|3.0|<br /> <br />The world of imagination as created by Sir James Matthew Barrie is solidly entrenched in both children books and in films such as \\"Finding Neverland.\\" Viewing the superb acting talents of Johnny Depp, portraying the 19th century English writer J. M. Berrie, is tantamount to watching a great artist at work. The film laces Barrie's life before, during and after meeting his wife Kate Winslet, with the Victorian views of the day. What is glossed over or at the very least dissipated by the delicate film are the circulating rumors, societal suspicions and vicious gossip regarding Mr. Barries' real reason for marrying the matron widow and her attractive family. The film proves witty, incisive and stocked with family values seldom found in other movies. Anyone seeking a glimpse of turn-of-the-century England will enjoy Depp's performance as he reveals the inspirational origins for his memorable story of Peter Pan. **   <br />
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie is a must see.  You will change your outlook on life.  What is really important? What is the small stuff you should let slide?  It reminds you of how short life really is and live each day like it's your last.  <br />Beautiful love story but harsh reality of how fast one can be taken from you.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I have watched this on tv since I was a child and the 40th anniversary was well worth the money spent.  I will enjoy this with my children for many years to come.  I would suggest that all families include this in their libraries.
B000244FDW|2.0|How does this original version compare with the later version starring Colin Firth? I found the best way was to compare the characterisations.<br /><br />Elizabeth: As portrayed here by Elizabeth Garvie, she is a saintly, passive milksop akin to Gone With The Wind's Melanie Wilkes except that Melanie was more spirited. Jennifer Ehle is pouting and petulant but at least she has life. In Garvie's big scenes - the rejection of Collins, Darcy's first proposal, the confrontation with Lady Catherine, she smiles sweetly and shows no fire, no emotion, no nothing. We cannot believe that she is attracted to Darcy in any way, and her voiceovers ('I am mortified') portray her as a shrinking violet. This is not Jane Austen's spirited Elizabeth.<br /><br />Darcy: No contest here. Colin Firth has defined the character. David Rintoul is uncomfortably stiff. Again, we see none of the swirling emotions he feels about Elizabeth. He appears to dislike her from the beginning. Where is the growth in his respect and love for her? Rintoul is incapable of showing any change in his character, so that the final proposal scene is laughable.<br /><br />Mr & Mrs Bennet: Alison Steadman was a shrill monster; viewed as caricature she was believable. The actress in the older version is just irritating beyond belief, and her gushing over Lydia and negelect of her other daughters is taken to extremes. Mr Bennet is no longer the kindly soul whose marriage has left him an empty shell but who still loves Elizabeth dearly. In the older version his retreats to the library to escape his wife, while understandable, obliterate his character, and he comes across as grumpy.<br /><br />The other sisters are cyphers. Lydia is grotesque. She is played in the newer version by Julia Sawalha as not much more than a prostitute (modernised beyond belief) but in the older version, as with Mrs Bennet, she is impossible to watch. I cannot believe that Austen really intended the characters to be as unsympathetic as they are portrayed here. Jane and Bingley barely seem capable of communication let alone love, while Bingley's sisters are obnoxious and unpleasant.<br /><br />There is far more in Austen's comedy of class and manners than either version can show, but the edge must go to the Colin Firth version, for his portrayal alone, despite the glaring deficiencies of Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth.s they are portrayed here.

B000BFH2S2|5.0|My first exposure to Michael Buble live was this video. To say I loved it is an understatement! Wow, I enjoyed every minute and loved the behind the scenes extras - I watched that part twice now and he leaves me giddy!!!!! All the comments about him being fun to watch and listen to are right on target - he's just so cute and talented and funny!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I approached this cd with trepidation.  Would my beloved band be as good as it was in the past?  Better than good.  Great.  Stevie's voice is great, Lindseys guitar brilliant.  The words are relevent to the times.  There are political statements as well as personal compositions.  \\"What's the World Coming To\\" the initial song, reintroduces us to FM in a pop, comfortable song.  \\"Illume\\", Stevies ode to NYC and the WTC captures the feelings of anyone who loves that city.  You can close your eyes and picture the lights of city at night reflecting on the river \\"like a diamond snake in a black sky\\".  She's an honorary NYer. <br />\\"Peacekeeper\\" is another political statement. <br /> <br />Most of the other songs, many of them dusted off from earlier albums, are life tales, appropriate for FM at this point of their life.  Most of the songs are edgy, without being too much.  Buckingham goes a little overboard with \\"Murrow\\", \\"Come\\" and \\"Red Rover\\" (IMHO), but that doesn't harm this CD.
B000BYA5GE|3.0|Wars have always been an integral part of humanity's suicidal efforts to destroy itself. In the film, Lord of War, Nicolas Cage, plays Yuri Orlov, who's weapons, allow the process of death and mass murder to become an art form. The film is unapologetic and quite brutal as are the actors who portray the various waring dictators, soldiers and merchants of death participating in the gun-trade. Following his transformation from drug pusher to arms dealer, Yuri displays a genius for circumventing international law and becomes an expert at delivering death to any infant nation struggling for survival around the world. Chased by a persistent Federal agent from the U.S., as well as inter-pol agents, the film is set to the background of various conflicts around the globe. The film is a social statement which reminds us, there are many nations who's leaders would rather prostitute their country's resources and the lives of their people, than establish a future for them. Cage is perfect as the soulless arms dealer who learns there is a personal price in becoming a pimp. **  <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|It's great to see Hollywood finally show what life for hard working men in desolate areas is like when they are unable to be in the company of women. I will never be able to look at a guy in a cowboy hat the same way. The only criticism I have of the movie was that the male heteros seemed pretty one dimensional. Though it may be unfamiliar territory for western writer McMurtry, lets hope the creative minds behind this can write a sequel (of sorts) which takes place on a Naval submarine starring Tom Selleck and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the unlucky-in-love pair.
B000063UR2|5.0|As long as unicorns roam the earth evil can never harm the pure of heart, and that is why the prince of Darkness has sent his most foulest goblins out into the very daylight he seeks to destroy forever to cut off the horns of the last two remaining. But when Jack (the forest boy, played by a very young Tom Cruise) takes Lily (a royal princess, played by the beautiful Mia Sara) to see them, she does the forbidden and touches these ancient creatures. Lily soon discovers it was she who unintentionally lured the unicorns into the goblin's trap; enabling them to shoot the poison stinger into one of the \\"beasts\\", as they call them, with a clear view. She vows to make things right again as the land becomes shrouded in a blanket of snow by trying to protect the remaining unicorn, but she is too frail to even defend herself. She thus is captured, along with the unicorn, and is taken back to the great tree where the wicked come to sacrifice. There the prince of Darkness yearns for a companion and tries to make Lily one of them by tempting her with jewels and power while Jack and his new friends Honeythorn Gump, a jealous sprite, and some other nymphs device a plan to save Lily, the unicorn, and the world before it is covered in eternal shadow.<br /><br />Legend wasn't too well received in theaters and was not a favorite among critics but it has quickly become a cult classic with fantasy lovers like me. Considering the low budget director Ridley Scott was given in order to make this film in the mid-80s, I thought they did a wonderful job in bringing William Hjortsberg's dark fairytale to life, which was written specifically for the screen. I also felt the entire cast put on remarkable performances - especially Tim Curry who went through hell (pun intended) to look as devilish as he does...<br /><br />Within this two-disc set is two versions of the film. One is the director's cut, as it was intended to be seen, and the other is the U.S. theatrical version, which I personally prefer, as do many others apparently. There are many extended scenes in the director's cut that were taken out of the U.S. release to trim down the overall running time but I felt the U.S. version simply flowed better. It also features a more dramatic score by Jerry Goldsmith instead of the more emotional score by Tangerine Dream and doesn't include the closing credits song \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\\" by Brian Ferry, ending the movie on a more magical note. But still, it was nice to see both versions and to compare the two. There's also a lot of bonus material in the limited edition of Legend that many fans will be grateful for.ny others apparently.

B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is an ultra rare type of album which you like all tracks in the CD. System of a Down (or SOAD) has to be the best band ever, their confusing and extroadonary songs are masterpieces. Well, here we go:    1) Prison Song 10/10: Wierd, fun, and humorous song about the prison system and how to make a prisoner's life better and legal. Best part: Serj rapping about you policing the globe.    2) Needles 7/10: Catchy with an amazing part by Daron. But other than that, nothing's really special about this one.     3) Deer Dance: 9/10: An extroadonary song about how we are violent with the poor. Best part: The opening guitar riffs and the chorus, I just keep moving and dancing when I hear it.    4) Jet Pilot 9/10: Fun song but most people find it way too loud and makes no sense, I don't. Best part: After all the screaming by Serj, we hear great lyrics from Serj, \\"My, horse, is a shackled old man...\\"    5) X  9/10: Just like Jet Pilot. Best part: The beginning sounds like music from a video game.    6) Chop Suey 10/10: Best song ever, the fun part is that it makes no sense! Best part: The piano part at the end.    7) Bounce 10/10: A SOAD gem, very wierd song, with wierd noises. Best part: Serj singing about pogo sticks!!!    8) Forest 10/10: Bouncy song, although I don't understand what the hell is it about. Best part: Everything!!!!!!    9) ATWA 8/10: Well done song but not the best. Best part: The beginning has a very touching guitar riff.    10) Science 10/10: WOW. This song is a huge gem. It talks about how science destroys our Mother Earth. Best part: The amazing guitar plucks in the middle with a Wierd Arabic language.    11) Shimmy 11/10: This is the first song I've ever heard from SOAD and the reason that made me a big fan of them, that's why I reward it a bonus point. Best part: The closing, \\"DON\\"T BE LATE FOR SCHOOL AGAIN BOY! DON\\"T BE LATE FOR SCHOOL AGAIN GIRL!.....\\"    12) Toxicity 8/10: Slightly weak song. Best part: The first two sentences by Serj.    13)Psycho 10/10: Best song in the album, if not, the world. It talks about groupies that are high with cocaine. Best part: The chorus is fun like hell.    14) Aerials 10/10: Lovely. Just lovely.
B0000019PA|1.0|First off, I'm a musician... I like abstract music... So after hearing a bunch of people rave about this LP, I had to pick it up. Sounded like it'd be right up my alley! So I put the CD on... One word, TERRIBLE! I've tried to listen to this album numerous times but the off key whiney vocals and amateur songwriting put me off.  Seriously, do people say this is a masterpiece just to be cool? It cant be because of the music.. OK, let me be fair, maybe there is 5 minutes worth of music on this disc that is remotely enjoyable. Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy something good!
B00005NB0H|4.0|This record markes the start of what was in my opinion the Who's best period up until Who are you. Anyway the old vinyl version was great and then we were confronted with the cd, then another extended version, then this one. OK it is great but if you have already bought it 2-3 times you knid of find it less funny. If you do not own the other versions this is a clear 5 star record however.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|I really looked forward to this release.  I had not seen the 'extended version' as presented on Fox, and I was hoping for some of the 'gaps' in the theatrical release to be filled.  After watching the longer version of the film on this DVD release, I can understand why some of the scenes were cut -- and I can also understand why David Lynch had his name pulled from the longer version.<br /><br />At several points in the film, I noticed that scenes were repeated -- for instance, after the House Atreides arrives on Arrakis, we see a group of troopers led by a huge Atreides banner ascending the steps in front of the landing craft.  After a couple of cuts showing the Duke and his family descending the steps,  we see the same scene again.  I also personally found the male narration in the longer version less effective than that of Princess Irulan in the theatrical cut.  True, the longer narration gives more background to the story -- but as the voice spoke of the different characters and planets involved, it seemed to be out of sync with the paintings shown.  It left me with the feeling that I had just sat through some blatant filler material.<br /><br />Also, in several places, the English subtitles were transcribed incorrectly (I had them on in some parts of the film just to check).  For example, in the scene where Duke Leto is brought before Baron Harkonnen, the Baron notes that the insignia has been torn from the Duke's uniform.  The Duke's mentat, Piter, informs him that 'Feyd did it' (referring to the Baron's nephew, Feyd Rautha) -- the subtitles misinterpret this remark (as well as the subsequent remarks by the Baron), displaying 'Fate did it'.  The Baron replies, 'Oh, Feyd?' and the subtitles read 'You don't say?'  This is a small discrepancy, I'll admit, but it's very indicative of the sloppiness of this release.<br /><br />When I watch this in the future -- and I plan to do so many times -- I'll watch the shorter, theatrical version.  The story isn't that hard to follow if the viewer pays attention -- and it's worth it, in my mind, to see a more cohesive film that flows far more naturally.  As at least one other reviewer below noted, longer isn't necessarily better.<br /><br />I also noticed a 6-hour version mentioned below.  If this is ever released, I hope that David Lynch has a hand in it.  Putting his work into the hands of others to edit it and reassemble it didn't work so well here.<br /><br />A final note on the comments by another reviewer about defective discs:  the first copy of this I obtained had the same problem -- the disc was loose in the case, having been jarred off the hub in shipment, I'm guessing.  When I attempted to view it, my DVD player didn't even recognize the presence of a disc.  Several of the other copies in the store were the same way.  When I returned it, I found one that didn't rattle -- I brought it home and it played just fine.  This might have something to do with the metal presentation box that Universal evidently thought was important to their marketing plans for this release -- I wonder how much their attempt to be 'fancy' is going to wind up costing them?hard to follow if the viewer pays attention -- and it's worth it, in my mind, to see a more cohesive film that flows far more naturally.

B0001I562I|5.0|Well friends, it's been-awhile since we've had a TRILOGY of reviews, hasn't it?  Today I've got a great-one in store for you.  I just had a movie-marathon and I'm going to bring my thought-dream to you now.  type...type...type...Let's RE-VIEW!    I think I saw this movie a looooong time ago when I was very little.  It didn't quite have an impact on me then, like it does now.  I probably related a lot to the kid and his dog at the beginning of the movie, where he's training his dog to be an e-lite frisbee catching machine.  At least, you think he's training the kid to catch frisbees, really he's (most likely) training the dog to catch daggers, or throwing stars, or bricks.  Things that could be thrown at them while him and his-dog are on secret missions in the future.    What I never realised is that the boy-adventurer gets taken 8 years into the future.  He hasn't aged a bit, and his dumb parents don't even notice, they're just like \\"HOWARD! (or whatever the kids name is) Where have you been!?\\". Now that he is the same age and everyone else has grown up (including his dog-panion) he feels displaced and forms an even BETTER bond with his space-ship. The bond is FANTASTIC!  They have such a great time together.  Howar// I mean the boy-adventurer takes the space-ship to a farm and the ship teaches him about creatures from other planets that eat hats and the boy teaches the ship how to laugh and pee and the grown-ups just run around and yell and don't know what's going on just like in real-life.  The ship needs the boy because he has space charts in his head and the boy needs the ship because it takes him places.      Unfortunately the space-ship eventually has to leave and go on other alone-missions and the boy doesn't understand.  He thought they were having such a good time and could go on adventures forever.    Whatever, I didn't say I liked the near ending, but I give the writer credit for making it realistic.  All in all I gave the movie five stars for the boy-space-ship-bond, and then had to deduct 4 stars for not letting the boy and his ship-panion have a happy ending and go on other great adventures.  To be fair I'll add one star because when the boy is returned to his time, his-dog licks his face all over and then they play with fireworks, and that's how a good Howard Tuttleman-day ends.  Later.    howardtuttleman.com    P.S.  I just tried to edit the review because it says I gave the movie five stars and it won't let me take-it-back.  I just want you to know that Howard Tuttleman has only rated the movie 2 stars.  Okay, maybe three now that I've had time to think-it-over, but NOT 5!  Later.    howardtuttleman.com
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|After I heard about another delay in the release of Advent Children in North America, I decided to just go ahead and get an English subtitled version.  Boy, am I glad I did that.  Advent Children is a rush of a movie that will have all FF7 fans cheering.  I was squealing with delight to see all my favorite characters back (and looking amazing, I might add.)  Reading subtitles was really no problem for me, although the version I have is a little buggy.  You should still buy the North American version (if it EVER comes out) but don't wait that long to see this amazing movie.
B000002P2V|5.0|This album came out right during post-punk and is quite simply spectacular. It does encompass most styles from Hard Rock (Trick of the light), electronic music (905) as well as much more complex compositions such as Guitar and Pen. Unfortnately it is the Who's last great album, but what an album. Even though Keith Moon would soon pass away he still is on great form throughout the album.
B0006399FS|4.0|I realise people have a tendency to write reviews regarding ultra-pop bands like U2 without listening the album carefully. I had a bad first impression when I saw them playing \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" on MTV, which I found too corny and over-dramatic for my taste. After I bought the album and listened, I changed my opinion. \\"Miracle Drug\\" is the first song you should listen. It's a great power tune with inspired guitar riffs and fantastic dynamics. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is a very touching song Bono wrote about his relationship with his late father. It has got a terrific guitar tremolo and Bono singing at the top of his lungs. \\"All Because Of You\\" is THE U2-anthemic-rock'n'roll song at its best. This album was made by a mature band who knows what they're doing, and you can feel that while you listen -- it is also filled with melody, mood and above-average lyrics. By the way, \\"Vertigo\\" has the most exciting intro since \\"I Will Follow\\"!
0790729342|5.0|Now this movie is much different from Part 1.  This is a movie about a man and his dog in the near future.  This is a new type of review I call an \\"A thought-dream of future events\\" style. <br /> <br />I'm going to share a little Howard Tuttleman secret with you.  I've never tried dog-food, but I'm highly considering it because of this movie.  In the future, when we are scavengers and have to sur-vive, I may have to do things that I'm not normally inclined to.  This includes sharing a meal with my dog-panion as M. Gibson does in this movie.  The reason that I'm so casually admitting this is because I'd like to warn you, the reader out there, that my genious detects a 5-SKULL future-nightmare on the horizon and this movie depicts it very well. <br /> <br />Some may think this is just one of those end-of-the-world-drive-around-and-stuff-blows-up-movies, but it's not.  Way back when whenever this movie was made, they knew that there was going to be an oil crisis and a big war and from what I hear-around, that's kind of like what's going on....right about now, and it's the type of major event that I've been preparing for, A FULL-ON URBAN-WAR-ZONE. But like I said, it's just a warning. <br /> <br />In this movie, the dog does such great tricks.  It's like him and the Road-Warrior are of the same mind.  Oh how they trick people together.  Unfortunately the Dog-Warrior eventually takes an arrow for M. when they are attacked by ogre-ish Harley-Bopper types.   <br /> <br />Unlike in Flight of the Navigator where the boy chooses a space-ship to replace the bond that he had with his dog, M. chooses a savage boy who he treats like a dog.  Actually, now that I think about it, this dog-boy catches frisbees just like the dog from F.O.T.N.  Amazing!  I think I've just mined a great big hunk of brain-gold on this one! LOL!  But seriously, I will look into frisbees as ammunition later.  WHOA!  I mean as in not now, this is NOT the end of the review.  I almost submitted by habit! <br/> <br />I give this movie 5 stars because I feel it is my destiny.  Later. <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
B000AJJNPY|5.0|<br />As you can tell by the number of reviews, this group has such an impact on people that they want to write about it. <br />I'm no different, and I'd like to add my two cents. <br /> <br />Sigur Ros have struck the perfect balance in Takk. . . between what is refered to as \\"accesability\\" and introspective,slow, creative musical expression. <br />Basically, they're not quite as slow and wierd as they used to be, but their not too normal and uninspired either. <br /> <br />This will probably be their best album ever because it has reached that perfect harmony, that perfect balance. <br /> <br />This band has moved in the opposite direction of radiohead, whose most perfectly balanced album was OK Computer (far more radio friendly than sigur ros, but the analogy still holds true i believe) <br /> <br />The name of the CD means \\"Thanks\\" and that's what I want to say to Sigur Ros and the musical spirit which inspires their truly unique, beautiful, and sincere music. <br />
B000002P2W|5.0|While the who belonged to the stadium giants back in the 70's, they recorded a very personal and intimate album that was completely at odds with this persona they had on-stage. This is a beautifully written and recorded album. The playing is very very simple. Songs such as Slip Kid and However Much I Booze are up there with the Who's best songs. Is a Hand or a Face is even better,simply spectacular.
B000060OFT|1.0|Before she played this movie to the class <br />My Film and Lit professor lent some words. <br />She said, \\"Though Shakespeare might seem higher class, <br />Baz Luhrmann knows the truth behind the Bard. <br />His words are universal, and his tales <br />Should play the same in all its viewers' eyes.\\" <br /> <br />Now I agree, this statement does ring true <br />When well-produced and well-performed it is, <br />And Zefferelli never did confuse <br />But made a film comparable to bliss. <br />Though I have played on stage in Much Ado <br />And read the play more times than I would count, <br />Hearing Claire Daines regurgitate those words <br />Convinces me she's better played on mute. <br /> <br />And Leo he, when madness takes its flight <br />Can move to tears despite his gentle face, <br />But he knows not the meaning of his lines. <br />Even a Shakespeare fan will lose his place. <br /> <br />What happened to the samurai who toiled <br />In Kurosawa's version of King Lear, <br />Or to the dancing gangsters on the West <br />Whose modern take a generation blessed? <br /> <br />Hell, even Ethan Hawke could Hamlet play <br />If Murray is Polonius behind, <br />And when he faces with his closing breath <br />I don't proclaim \\"At last! The end is nigh!\\" <br /> <br />In short, they took what might've been inspired <br />And pushed far too far for it to please. <br />In fact that truly understates the case, <br />For I would say they pushed it off a cliff.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I can't say enough how much I enjoy this fantastic album. I love every song on it. What a great way to do housework with Madonna blasting from the living room!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I feel this will forever be Radiohead's best album.  Not too pop (like pablo honey) and not too wierd (anything after Ok Computer) <br />Don't get me wrong.  I love Kid A and Amnesiac, but I believe this is their true masterpiece and one of the best albums ever. <br />
B000000OMB|5.0|i object to the review below that says tupac sucks...i love asia, i have this album on record, cassette, cd, my computer, in my car, and on my video ipod because this album rocks, but tupac is also awesome. nothin like listening to some angry nig**r music once in a while!
B000AA305M|5.0|I am disappointed that many people are confusing the quality of the music with the quality of the physical CD.  Yes, it sucks that Sony is making it difficult to put this album on a I Pod but what does that have to do with David Gray's work as an artist. <br />He is comming to Milwaukee in March and I can't wait to hear his new songs.
B0000029DD|5.0|What else could I describe Jeff but as an artist. A good one at that. The songs on Grace are daring as they are beautiful. The rendition of Hallelujah is heartbreaking. The title track is amazing. Lover(...) is far-out. But they album is also filled with many secrets. The various refrences to water and death. This appears throughout many of his other works, and it is somehow a foreshadow to his unique death. His voice reaches out to you. He uses his vocal gift of four octaves to it's greatest potential. And throughout the whole album he uses his writing talent to it's fullest potential.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|I listen to this dvd almost daily and love it musically. Unfortunately, I was disapointed with the DVD in terms of the camera work and direction. So many shots were out of focus that you have to wonder whether the guys on camera were inexperiened or on drugs. The other issue was the director who switched so often between shots that I was disappointed not to see Ginger in particular in full flight and from a wider perspective. This is the second negative review I have posted because the first went missing! I have been waiting for another dvd of the madison square gardens sets hoping the presentation would be better.
B00008H2LB|4.0|First of all... Linkin Park is not emo... I heard a lot about them being this and that and decided to see for myself... I must say, I have never heard a sound as \\"refined\\" before. It sounds like it was worked A LOT maybe too much some times... Anyway, to get back to the emo image this band has: This is not really emo... I see the comparison, but this is nu-metal and nothing more... You are not going to say that Korn is emo, but they still write stuff like \\"Love is my souvenir of sadness\\" or whatever... the voice of the singer changes it all in your minds... don't judge to quickly and don't assign music to little boxes... I know I could not like pure emo ;) This is only lyrism... ;) <br /> <br />Now with the CD:  <br />I was very pleased. The overall sound of their music is the \\"gem\\" if I can say because the guitar isn't really that good, so is the rapping and the other instruments... And the lyrics have been sung a thousand times before... I think that the singer sings (screams?) well... Not a masterpiece, but definitly worth a listen... and please drop your prejudices... emos just don't understand that you actually CAN be happy living... LOL <br /> <br />8 out of 10 <br /> <br />key tracks are : \\"Somewhere I belong\\", \\"Breaking the habit\\" and the instrumental track \\"session\\"
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I love movies so much that I watch very few of them. The endless stream of worthless trash (and by \\"worthless trash\\" I am referring both to the quality of the films and their objectionable content) Hollywood spews out is a disgrace to the power and beauty of the medium. In my opinion the fact that box office receipts are slowly sinking is testimony to this. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy is a bright spot in the recent history of cinema. Both a commercial and critical uber-success, Rings brought one of my favorite books of all time to life in a way that I could never have predicted. Jackson follows Rings with King Kong, and while watching this remake of the 1933 original I was reminded of two things, (1) why I like the movies in the first place and (2) why so many other filmmakers are contributing to the silver screen's current malady. I'll try to explain what I mean. While watching Kong - I don't know if it was during the dinosaur stampede or the T-rex fight - I was reminded that one reason I love movies is their ability to transport you into a thrilling new experience that's impossible to have in the routine of daily life. This seems like common sense, but the reason that this thought hit me with such force during these scenes was because I realized how few times that sort of thing had happened to me recently while watching movies. It takes a certain sort of filmmaker to dream up and then implement the kind of viscerally beautiful action scenes that Jackson puts into his movies. Think also of the giant oliphaunts knocking the horsemen of Rohan around like toys during the Battle of Pelennor Fields in Return of the King. Even Revenge of the Sith, with all its technical prowess, didn't have a scene that thrilled like the scene where Kong fights three T-rexes simultaneously, in my humble opinion the greatest fantasy action scene of all time. Other directors just can't do it like Jackson can. I don't know if it's that other directors simply don't have the technical ability to implement such a scene or if it's simply that they don't have the creative vision to dream it up. In one review I read that the character of King Kong is the single greatest visual effect of all time, and I would concur. That's not to say that Kong is without problems. The New York sequence seemed a bit rushed, and whenever a studio writes a blank check to a director, as Universal did with Jackson, the director's ego is bound to get in the way. Jackson could have cut 30, maybe even 45 minutes out of this one and no one would have missed them. The sub-plot between Jimmy and Hayes seemed to be a waste of time with no real resolution, and the spider-pit sequence seemed a bit unnecessary as well. But those foibles I will gladly forgive if the rest of the movie delivers on my overpriced movie ticket. Kong does that, and then some. Jackson is truly one of the great imagineers of cinema, and Kong reminds me why I go to the movies in the first place. <br /> <br />
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is one of the best shows on T.V. right now.  It's new, fresh, and always exciting.  I haven't missed an episode since the first one and I'm so glad.  I can't wait until this box set comes out so I can rush out and buy it!
B000084T18|1.0|When 50 First came on the scene, I was a little skeptic of what he was all about. I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip-hop artist. I was dead wrong. WHen this CD was first released, I didnt think it was terrible, but the more it got overplayed, and the more nosense I heard about 50, the less appealing the CD became to me. It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre (thank Interscope Records) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label. What a joke, not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster, he is a total sell out. I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa's and Star Magazine parties. Sure he is a ganasta alright. Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times. I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high-school. Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label, and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him. DO I have proof that this happened? NO, but I am more then 99.9% sure that this is how it went down. Everyone do 50 and favor and boycott his next CD, then maybe his can Get Poor and Die Penniless.
6302720419|3.0|Following in the tradition of such Stephen King movies as \\"The Shining\\", this move uses psychological terror with blood and gore to scare viewers. <br /> <br />The movie takes place in Gatlin, Nebraska. A young couple, Burton (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton), are travelling through rural America.  Burton has just graduated from medical school and is on his way to his first internship.  However, the pair end up getting lost and accidentally run over a person who has emerged from one of the fields alongside the road.  Unsure of what to do, Burton places the body in his trunk.  Eventually, Burton and Vicky decide that they need help and begin looking in Gatlin. <br /> <br />They soon realize there are no adults in Gatlin; only children.  The children have brutally murdered all of the adults and started a cult which worships the corn and someone known as \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\".  The cult is led by Isaac (John Franklin) and Malachai (Courtney Gains).  After watching, the viewer learns that the true presence is not IN the corn, but UNDER it.  Burton and Vicky must get out of Gatlin at all costs or die at the hands of Isaac, Malachai, and the other cult members. <br /> <br />I thought this was a good movie, but not as scary as I had hoped.  Some parts, such as the scenes of the thing running through the fields undergound was scary, but there was little else.  Isaac's and Malachai's struggle for control over the cult was thrilling to see, but I thought Horton and Hamilton gave only average performances.  John Franklin, however, was very good as the man-child Isaac, while Gains' portrayal as Isaac's right-hand man and eventual antagonist Malachai was equally good. The many unanswered questions, such as what ever happened to the body in the trunk, and what is the thing under the rows of corn, are frustrating.  <br /> <br />I recommend this movie, but I do feel that it could have been better.  However, the psychological suspense of not knowing what was going to happen next was evident in the movie.  The producers must have done something right, because there were several sequels made to this movie.  I've been a fan of Stephen King movies for years, but I wish this one would have been a little better.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Overall this will probably be the best treatment Dune will get unless David Lynch himself gets involved with an all new re-edit. <br />Having watched the tv version again after several years is a mixed blessing. The good,we finally have the tv version in widescreen so we can finally watch the deleted and extended scenes in their proper composition.The bad, I finally realized how hastily slapped together this longer version was despite the fact that it had some wonderful added scenes. It's ironic because it was the tv version that introduced me to Frank Herberts wonderful universe. I originally disliked Lynch's version because I couldn't follow it back in 1984. The tv version made more sense story wise. Years later after reading the book I admire Lynch's version a lot more. It's definitely a more refined film even with all its flaws. The deleted scenes were definitely a revelation. This dvd edition just makes it more frustrating in the fact that had Delaurentis given Lynch final cut , we definitely would have had a film most Dune fans would love. It's just a big What Could Have Been !!!!
3937406328|5.0|This CD will test two things: Your love of the blues and your love of Chris Rea. If you're a lover of both, you'll recognize an artist who hit the height of his musical powers at the same time as he hit a near fatal low in his health.<br /><br />This CD is testimony to the power of being true to yourself and acknowledging your roots. Here is an artist who has refused to go on being ruled by the fickle criteria of commercial success and has had the courage to follow his heart. Chris Rea is willing to let his audience make up their own minds about this body of work. Anyone who loves the blues will love this CD. Anyone who acknowledges Chris Rea as one of the most important musical artists of his generation will be eternally grateful that he returned to the music that feeds his soul.<br /><br />Go beyond what's expected of you as a music consumer and confound the pundits - buy this brilliant collection of songs (they're not just blues numbers, they're beautifully written songs) and rejoice in an artist who found a way to be true to himself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently rented \\"Serenity\\" on a tip from a friend who knows I like both a good story and science fiction.  I saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the characters.  (As a writer and marketing consultant, a good story and good characters that you care about are the name of the game, not blowing up sound stages.) <br /> <br />What a shock when I saw some of the special features and learned that there was actually a SERIES, called \\"Firefly.\\"  I had never heard of it.  I ran to the video store, got the whole series, and paced myself to watch just one a night -- I knew I only had 14 shots at it, and that would be that. <br /> <br />What a terrible thing to happen:  One of the most enjoyable, clever, intelligent, realistic programs to hit television in decades -- and what a most plausible feel for the future! -- and the short-sighted desk-squatters at Fox give Joss a hard time from the get-go and then cancel it. <br /> <br />I only hope that there is a way to get the series -- and all the characters (Joss, you'll have to work on bringing back Wash) -- back on a network interested in quality and entertainment as well as profit.  In Star Trek's day, that was impossible, and the best that true believers in that series could do was push hard, and publicly, to get numerous movies made. <br /> <br />I realize Serenity-The Movie only broke even, although I hope the DVD sales will add to the ROI.  But as much as I hope for a series of movies, it is very important to bring back this series to that incredibly expanding wasteland known as television.  You can tell from the sincerity in the cast, senior executives and Joss that this was a labor of love and something very special. <br /> <br />For once, can television go for creativity and a true portrayal of relationships and good story-telling, over the formulaic frappuccino's audiences must swallow each night? <br /> <br />I call for one brave television executive to call one brave and talented creative mind -- Joss -- to tell him that a wonderful, important TV series is a terrible thing to waste.
B000059XUI|5.0|It's very rare for a sequel to eclipse its predecessor (The GODFATHER and X-MEN series feature examples along with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and SPIDERMAN 2) but this movie comes close to being a better picture than the classic superhero movie that preceded it two years earlier, almost - but not quite.<br />Perhaps it is the fact that the two were originally shot back-to-back (before the Salkind brothers fired Director Richard Donner and brought in Richard Lester) but this movie shares a tone and panache of the first movie in the series that the subsequent films lacked. I suppose it is no surprise then that the upcoming (at the time of writing) big screen SUPERMAN RETURNS takes place after this entry thereby totally negating the slapstick SUPERMAN III and horrendous SUPERMAN IV.<br />At the beginning of the first movie we saw Superman's father Jor-El prosecute three criminals and send them out hurtling into space. These events are recounted at the beginning of this movie, and I still remember watching the opening in a darkened theater one night in the early 1980s, wondering if the first movie had accidentally been placed in to the projector.<br />These three criminals are led by the excellent Terence Stamp (who would later provide the voice of Jor-El in the SMALLVILLE television series) as Zod and included the very sexy Sarah Douglas as Ursa. They subsequently make their way the Moon and after decimating an Apollo crew head for Earth marveling at their superhuman abilities.<br />Meanwhile on Earth, after rescuing Lois Lane (played by the very appealing Margot Kidder who was the focus of a schoolboy crush on my part) from a hostage situation in Paris, Clark Kent is having an increasingly difficult time trying to keep his identity a secret. Then when Lois learns the truth the two get together, which forces Clark to turn in his powers - just at the very moment that Zod and his companions are arriving to wreak havoc.<br />Add to the mix Gene Hackman reprising his role as Lex Luthor (who has some of the best lines in the movie) and what follows is a highly entertaining action movie. Will Clark be able to get his powers back? Will he be able to defeat three with the same powers he has and will he be able to exact some payback on that guy at the diner who beat him up when he was powerless Clark Kent? My favorite scenes in the movie are those that center on the battle between Superman and the three supervillains as they duke it out on the streets of Metropolis (actually filmed in England on the studio backlot). The special effects look a little hokey today and the modelwork is very noticeable in some scenes, but this is good old fashioned fun and probably one of the best comic book movies ever committed to celluloid.<br /><br />SPECIAL EDITION DUE IN 2006<br />Unfortunately the same attention was not given to this movie as its predecessor when the series was released on DVD.

B000B8QF14|5.0|For the Ammazon.com reviewer I had to set the record straight, American Idiot and BIAB are not anti-American. And if you had watched or listened to it you would know that. Billie-Joe himself says it quite plainly that the song Hoilday is anti-war. And after many, many listens to both AI and BIAB I agree. It's quite possible to be an American and not believe in War or support the current administration and punk has always been the voice of the disaffected. I just hope Green Day continues giving us such great music.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I gave this game to my grown son and wife for Christmas.  The day after, we played it for 8 hours straight.  It is also good for kids (age 6 or so and up).  It does not require reading skills, but is great for thinking skills, strategy skills and spatial relations skills.  I have bought several more for gifts.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|This movie is about 2 hours too long. After a very promising beginning the scenes of depression era New York City look well researched and lovingly recreated this film heads down hill fast. We meet the principles soon enough with each' motivation for taking this journey (which ends at Skull Island). As much as director Peter Jackson tries there is little chemistry between the two (human) leads which comes back to haunt the movie in it final scenes. Once at Skull Island get ready for some violent, freaky looking island natives and nonstop battles with dinosaurs, giant insects and other creatures beyond description. Watch as the ships crew get smashed, squished and eaten by the islands beast (minorities first please). After what seems an eternity the purpose for all this which is to rescue \\"the girl\\" finally gets underway you may have forgot all about that 25 foot ape after all this distraction. The transport of Kong is ignored and towards the end we find all survivors back in New York somewhere on Broadway, okay 7th avenue to be exact.  Now back in the real world the film ask us to suspend reality while we watch Kong take out his skimpily clad girlfriend for a date which includes ice skating in Central Park and ultimately a lovers lookout on top of the Empire State Building. King Kong itself is the best thing about this movie, the artistry of the creature is spectacular. Jackson has taken a very simple fairy tale and fleshed it out into a bloated if not obese special effects movie with little charm or reason to enjoy.
B00000G3I2|4.0|This movie probably falls flat for anyone not of the characters' ages...at the time of this movie(early 80's), about mid- to late-thirties. These were people affected by anti-war movements, race riots, the sudden availabilty of college to almost any comer. They have their faults, have stumbled and succeeded in life, or at least hung on for the ride. When one of this once tight-knit group commits suicide, the gathering of the survivors (and an occasional dragged-along spouse) leads to increasingly deeper insights, into themselves, each other, the world around them. With such a large, strong ensemble cast, the movie can't probe too deeply, but overall the deep, abiding friendships that brought these people together in the first place, during their college years, works its magic again. For a weekend, anyway, they reconnect & circle each other in ways based on their past but tempered by the passing of time, when they became \\"responsible\\" (said like a four-letter word!). They play & replay their lives & relationships against the canvas of Meg Tilly's character, a much younger 20-something who had been living with the deceased friend. The gang constantly look to her for clues to answer the question, \\"why did he do it?\\", but in the end, their answers come from within themselves. <br /> <br />The great soundtrack is perfectly aimed at people coming of age in the sixties & crystalizes that moment in time so well. The cast is superb, most having become recognized as well-toned rising stars at the movie's release. <br /> <br />Anyone who was influenced by and was growing up in the sixties & seventies, who hung out with a group of friends who included: an egghead, a nerd, a macho guy, a cool dude, a sexy girl, a hippie girl, a gearhead, a druggie or alkie, or some combination, can relate very much to this great movie. All others need to understand that, like many retrospective movies, much has been glossed over & certainly this represents only a certain group of these Baby Boomers.
B00005JNRE|3.0|Appearances can be deceiving.  This delightful film was based on children's stories about Nurse Matilda, and adapted by Emma Thompson who was Nanny McPhee, a magical gnome-like creature.  She'd arrived on the scene after the seven unruly children had successfully run off the 17th nannie from the agency, Nannys of Distinction.  This was no ordinary British household, as there was a cook and scullery maid named Evangelina. <br /> <br />Cedric Brown is caught between finding another wife or losing his brood.  He seems to be driven to distraction by this possibility and spends a lot of time talking to his dead wife's empty chair.  He never spends time with the children who are in constant turmoil because of their mother's death.  Simon's the eldest and is the precocious leader of all their mischief, played beautifully by Thomas Sangster, who could be the twin for Brett. <br /> <br />When the \\"government nanny\\" with a magic walking stick enters their lives, she has five lessons to teach the family and explains, \\"I cannot interfere with affairs of the heart.\\"  At first, her strange appearance and strict discipline are like a bad dream, as she tames the clever children.  After they learn to trust her, her appearance starts to change for the better as her ugliness fades away in phases.   <br /> <br />Nanny teaches them to adapt to circumstances in order to stay together as a family.  The servant is transformed into an acceptable stepmother.  She'd grown to love the children but Simon had told her \\"You're paid to like us and that doesn't count.\\"  At the outdoor garden wedding, it could have been a scene from Bennie Hill's outrageousness as the \\"well-behaved and groomed children\\" start their hijinks again, this time to save their father from a domestic life of doom.   <br /> <br />The prospective stepmother is worse than Cinderella's and, after they do what has to be done to stay together as a family (\\"that's all that matters\\"), the story evolves into a fairy-tale ending.  Snow in August transforms Evangelina, played by Kelly Macdonald, into a princess bride.  Love reigns supreme as Nanny McPhee makes her exit, like Nurse Matilda would do, to work her magic for other motherless children in crisis.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|The music of the movie is just great, and you can't expect less than that. While listening to this CD, you'll probably remember some songs of \\"The Nightmare before Christmas\\", all of them as great as in that movie (especially the \\"Wedding song\\"), though this time the CD contains only a few lyrics, being score everything else. The music fits perfectly for the movie, and most of the melodies are really pleasent to hear. And at the end, there are bonus tracks  that include some jazz-swing instrumental melodies that evoke the song \\"Reamins of the Day\\". <br /> <br />And for those, like me, who play the piano, you'll get really excited when listening to the piano solos. Belive me: you'll run to surf the net to get the sheet music. Defenetly worth your money.
B0000004F9|5.0|I finally bought a copy of this album, but I cant stop listening to volume 1, There are many great musical passages From \\"Hope for happiness\\" and especially \\"We did it again\\" where Robert Wyatts drumming leads the song occasional backing vocal, Kevin ayers low toned vocals and the occasional swirling organ of Mike Ratledge, Its repetative but interesting And \\"Why are we sleeping is also worth a listen. <br />What would it been like if Daevid Allen was still in the band at the time, unfortunately after the recording of the first self titled album they toured France, on return to England Daevid allen was refused entry and was sent back to france. <br />Volume 2 was a more jazz oriented I found on one of the songs the lyrics a bit immature unless you dont know the alphabet, I dont listen to vol-2 as much as vol-1. <br />Note that another album was recorded before volume 1 which is a selt titled album and can also be titled \\"Jet propelled photographs\\" or \\"In the beggining\\" The song are in a more simpler format, there is also a different version of \\"Save yourself\\" but unsure when this album was first released. <br />The first album and Vol-1&2 have to be the best Soft Machine albums I have heard so far. <br />
006441034X|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is, overall, a good book.  <br /> <br />That said, I don't think it is even in the same sphere of interest as J. R. R. Tolkien, or J. K. Rowling. The tone is different; DWJ maintains a witty tone, very emotional, but practical as well. She keeps you interested because of the ways her characters act. Sophie is a particularly complex character, and I enjoyed the ways in which she tried to deny her, um, feelings for Howl (especially the weed killer). I found Tolkien to be more detail-oriented, and less character-based. His books weren't as easy (or, in my opinion, interesting) to read. J. K. Rowling? A different story entirely. The three books don't compare, and not because one is better than the other. They're just completely different. <br /> <br />The book and the movie differ as well. At least two people I know, faced with me coaxing them into reading the book after seeing the movie, declined, with the excuse that they didn't think the book would be as good. This is definitely NOT TRUE. Miyazaki couldn't possibly summarize the character's personalities (Sophie's stubbornness and emotionalness; Howl's selfishness, and total escapism, and his courage, bravery, genius and hot! body, haha). He didn't even try. Come on. Even though I love Miyazaki, admire his films, and think he is truly skilled, I don't think this film was at all his best. The characters were saccharine. Sophie was a nice old woman without a lot of personality, and Howl was a seemingly selfish man who turned out to be a flying bird turned war hero turned 'ideal' male lead. And then there was the Witch. She WASN'T GOOD. SHE WAS EVIL. I know I sound pessimistic, and there were parts of the movie that made me love it... but as a movie. I loved this book first, and I was really disappointed with the movie. If you are looking for more Miyazaki, you're out of luck. <br /> <br />The book starts out with Sophie, the responsible sister of two girls constantly in competition and the daughterof a hatter and his new wife, an ex-assistant of the shop. She doesn't believe that she has much chance of striking it rich and living happily ever after. But soon, for reasons somewhat unknown, the Witch of the Waste decides to invade her shop, and turns her into an old woman! Shocked, Sophie soon begins her journey away from the hat shop to cure herself. She ends up staying as a cleaning lady for the notoriously womanizing wizard Howl. Supposedly, he eats hearts. Her encounter with him is complicated, involving two curses, unknown motivations, and all the supporting characters and sub-plots.  <br /> <br />The best thing about the book is Sophie's personality. She is actually an honorable person. In the beginning, she seems overly dutiful, and near the middle she can seem immature; but if you look more at the reasons she acts that way, her actual character becomes clear. I like that she's human, and acts in different ways. So that was what made the book for me.  <br /> <br />Give this book a chance! It's better than it might seem.

This past week my husband and watched all the shows and the movie.  Each one was better than the next, the plot developments were well thought out and written and the acting was wonderful.  To bad they dumped this show, such a loss for Fox.

B000B8QEYC|1.0|This LP will leave the listener with one thing on his/her mind:  Was there more than one, lengthy track on this whole CD?  The continuity is overt.  So overt,  in fact,  that one cannot assess where one track ends and the other ends, (Other than the fading silence).  Anyone can create this type of junkyard fodder:  Over layering does not make one a vocalist.<br /><br />These reverberating compositions are nothing more than repeats of Ryan/Enya's last 4 LPS.  Enya has been quoted as saying that she doesn't listen to ANY music,  not even her own.  Perhaps she should.  Music builds on itself.  All of the greats were influenced by one artist or another. Paying homage to an artist,  within the mind and interpretation of another,  makes for great music.  This type of music making is liking to a cult.  Enya is the Charles Manson of her own genre/industry.<br /><br />Cheap sentiment,  I detest it.  \\"A Day Without Rain\\" was adored by the masses.  The Bible thumping masses love \\"...Rain\\".  The horrid events of Sept. 2001 added fuel to the sales of that LP.  So many were looking for an answer.  The masses thought they had found an answer within Enya's music.  This type of music sells not because it sounds good,  but because 'they' WANT and DESIRE it to sound good.  It doesn't.  It's futile to brainwash oneself.  This music sucks. It is redundant,  and is nothing more than pseudo-religion.
0156027321|3.0|I am surprised by how many friends overwhelming recommended this book.  I read it because of that.  The story started well enough and showed a lot of promise.  But, the second half of the book was a bit of a let down.  So, the whole reading experience is only so-so for me.
0385040253|5.0|I'd always had an interest in knot tying.  I guess it came from childhood and not being able to be in the Boy Scouts.  I don't know exactly.  All I know is a year or so ago I decided I wanted to learn how to tie as many knots as possible.  With the internet at my fingertips I went on a search for a book of knowledge.  It didn't take me long to find out about The Ashley Book of Knots.  I didn't buy the book at the time because I got sidetracked with something else.  One day not too long ago the interest in knot-tying came back to me.  I was at a book store and just had to take a look.  I ended up buying an inferior book to get started, but soon my thirst for something more led me back to holy grail of knot tying (this book).  I decided to look it up in the local library and did find a copy, but it is reference only.  I eagerly searched for the book on the shelves and spotted it.  When I opened the book it was like angels sang and the sky opened up.  This is truly the bible of knot tying.  I made up my mind then and there, as I turned the pages reverently, that I must own this book.  Mine's on order now.

B000002WPI|5.0|One word \\"ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL\\" this album is witout a doubt one of da greatest hip-hop albums ov all time. It goes like this... When the Wu-Tang Clan emerged on the hip-hop scene in '1992' for the first time, it actually wasn't the first time. Wu producer The RZA had already released a single one year earlier and cousin GZA/Genius even a whole album, both with less success than expected from their respective labels, Tommy Boy and Cold Chillin' and both were dropped. RZA then mastered a plan of bringing together a bunch of guys, who already had been rhyming since the late 80's, charged 100 $ from everybody, took them in a studio and produced an album that had mad influence on the whole music world not just the rap world.  <br /> <br />After sellin' their first single 'Protect Ya Neck' out of trunks of there cars in '92, the 9 man, Shaolin-based rap crew (Staten Island) put out their heavily anticipated first full length release on LOUD Records. On the business side they had signed a ground-breaking deal with their record company. While the Clan as a whole was signed to LOUD, each member had the opportunity to move to another label for releasing solo material because of how lyrically inclined each rapper was. There wasent 9 guys and only 3-4 guys whoo could rap , every single member of the 9 man reckin crew could spit on a very high level. Thats what made it so much more insane. <br /> <br />The album itself can undoubtedly be claimed as one of the purest and classic hip-hop albums of all-time. More than that, it brought a completely new sound to the surface. Dark and gritty beats, laced with Kung-Fu movie samples and the outstanding talent from each of its members quickly made the Wu-Tang Clan a trademark as an explosive and hungry rap squad. To be honest the album has not one standout track. In actual fact, it has 13. When the 9 MC's get on the mic they make sure that everybody knows that Wu is number one. From GZA's smart lyricism and memorable metaphors to Inspectah Deck's razor sharp lines to Ol' Dirty [...] insanity, each member comes with the triple R sound: raw, rough and rugged. All have the talent to shine alone but as a crew they just cut heads. From auto-biografical street life stories like in C.R.E.A.M. or Tearz to the in Wu-standards almost commercial self-titled Method Man solo the album covers a lot of topics wanted to be heard. When listening to the album you can feel the seemingly endless amount of unusual raw energy the Clansmen put into this project, it's almost like a whirlwind that catches you throughout the 60min of superb music this LP offers. As I said the beats on the album are pure gems: simplistic, yet still catchy; eerie and at times dramatic; in RZA's unique style shaped as sharp swords to the ear of the un-trained listener and most of all matching perfect with the flows of Staten Island's verbal acrobats.  <br /> <br />In each track the Clan sparks the fire that's nowadays hardly to find on a hip-hop album even besides the commercial material. Nomen est omen on the first track, Bring Da Ruckus; On Clan In Da Front The Genius blesses us with lines that stand for its own like \\"I don't give a god damn/ all the shows you did/ how many rhymes you got, or who knows you kid/ Cause I don't know ya therefore show me what you know/ I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow\\". Ghostface Killah and Raekwon reminisce how easy it was back in the days on Can It Be All So Simple, while on the next song Da Mystery Of Chessboxin U-God opens with one of the rawest verses being heard on the album.  <br /> <br />To make it short: this albums has everything a classic needs and is definitaly one of the best hip-hop records ever recorded.  every new LP can be measured by this output and most likely every new LP will fail to top it. Hip-hop in its purest form is what even critics call this album. That's why it surely deserves a rating of 10. And till this day is one of da greatest rap albums of all-time.- Sorry 4 da long review. but this album iz definately worth every minute of me writin it.
B000002GQG|5.0|In Search of the Lost Chord (1968) is one of my favorite Moodies albums and perhaps one of my favorite experimental rock albums of all time, period.  My enjoyment of this album stems from the music itself, including the use of soft acoustic textures, loads of mellotron, plaintive vocals, and perhaps more significantly, the sheer innocence of the recording.  Although the cover art and lyrics suggest that the Moodies were wrestling with fairly heavy themes including the quest for spiritual enlightenment (at least based upon this Biologist's crude interpretation), they are presented in a manner that engages rather than alienates the listener.  With respect to the music, all of the pieces on the album are excellent (even the light-hearted and playful Dr. Livingston, I Presume?) and flow together to form a song-cycle suite of sorts.  Of course, in addition to the lighter pieces there are brooding and haunting moments on the album, but they are neither overbearing nor cliche.  Towards the end of the album, the listener is treated to very grave spoken parts and Justin Hayward's sitar passages that sound remarkably appropriate, and not the least bit dated (at least to my ears).  In spite of the fact that I was a toddler at the time of the album's release, the music and themes presented on In Search of the Lost Chord resonate deeply within me, perhaps moreso during these dark and ugly times. This CD has been remastered and contains liner notes that feature comments by band members regarding the album, along with various and sundry photos, and decent sound quality.  All in all this may very well be the Moodies best recorded performance and is very highly recommended along with Days of Future Passed (1967), To Our Children's, Children's, Children (1969), and A Question of Balance (1970).

0307276902|5.0|I was given this book as a gift by four different friends; my friends know me well because I really enjoyed this book.  Mr. Frey's memoir is painful, raw and very open.  His life is not pretty and neither is his recovery.      He is stubborn and confused and angry and does an excellent job of expressing his painful mix of emotions. While the description of his trip to the dentist will turn your stomach, I found the most difficult passages to be those involving his parents.  The greif and guilt, love and anger between them is very emotional.  If one has ever delt with an addicted family member you will react to this deeply.    Mr. Frey has written a memoir of his life as he remembers it and as he felt it.  That everything is not 100% accurate does not change the quality of the book, or the way he recalls his life.  It is his life, not Oprah's or anyone else's.    An interesting look at addiction and recovery; not a light read.
B00005JNRE|5.0|I have just returned from seeing this wonderful movie, and I must say that it is more than worth the trip!<br /><br />The colorful backgrounds are so much fun to watch throughout the entire movie ~ so storybook-like. The adult actors are superb, the children are delightful.<br /><br />Colin Firth is, as always, perfect; Emma Thompson is her usual impeccable self; Angela Lansbury is, of course, superb.<br /><br />There is nothing about this movie that I didn't like except that it was too short ~ I hated to see it end.<br /><br />When it comes out on DVD, I have every intention of buying it the first day!<br /><br />I highly recommend this one...
0307276902|2.0|Didn't anyone else get from the very first page that this story was partly fictionalized?  Who in their right mind believed that he would've been able to board an airplane in that condition?  And his friend \\"Leonard\\" seemed a little too contrived...the hard mobster with the heart of gold...come on!!!  Not a great book and not a bad book. I just admire him for getting under Oprah's skin!  Not an Oprah fan whatsoever!  And he wrote a book and made millions--GOOD FOR HIM!
0393327655|5.0|I've only read the first chapter, and my review is based upon it.   Harris directly asks the question \\"What good is faith?\\", and answers it just as directly: \\"Worse than useless, positively destructive\\".   <br /> <br />He makes two important points: (1) That blind faith is a certain recipe for the most stupid and destructive human behavior imagineable, in fact a recipe for disaster for the human race, and (2) that religious moderates provide \\"cover\\" for extremists/fundamentalists by refusing to criticize their right to believe whatever they want in the name of \\"faith\\". <br /> <br />On the first point Harris provides some great examples in just the first chapter, and no thinking person could disagree with his points, especially in light of recent world events.  On the second point, more novel and controversial, he also has a case, but I will have to read the remainder of the book to see how well he makes it. <br /> <br />Harris is bold; he is unconcerned with what people will make of his message. That alone is impressive in our day, when everyone has to tip-toe around so as not to offend this or that segment of society, especially the religious moralizers. <br /> <br />Buy it, read it, and THINK about it.

0743454537|4.0|This is normally not my kind of book. I tend to like fast moving mysteries (Patterson, Grishim). But I purchased it based on the recommendation of my book store owner. I expressed my enjoyment over \\"A Million Pieces\\" and \\"My Friend Leonard\\" (before all the bad hype) and she said to try this. Being the mother of 2, it became a very gripping read for me personally. Yes, the ending is a bit of a *gasp - NO* type of feeling, but isn't that what makes a great book? regardless of the ending, it's an emotional roller coaster of a fast read.
B000AP04L0|4.0|Only people who have ever spent thier days in a Cubicle/DWA(Designated work area)/Roofless Storage Shed, can really appreciate the comedy/tragedy of Dilbert. In that same context, only people who have ever called your boss a dumbass/$#(ker, really get what Office Space is about.  It hit home for me, as I laughed at a rendition of my own once lived period.  Those who gave low ratings probably never went through a expendable pee-on job experience.  So to those, I personally apologize if your champagne & caviar soiree' turned sour with this movie. <br /> <br />I would strongly emplore that you see experience this movie if you have ever had a job just to HAVE a job.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|If you enjoy Enya's music then you will surely enjoy the lilting and lovely sound of the music on Amarantine. I did sometimes wish that it wasn't so smoothed out with synthesizers, but that is Enya's style and for the most part she uses it well.  <br /> <br />I found it fascinating that her musical partner Roma Ryan created her own language, Loxian, for several songs on the CD. It was an interesting enterprise, but apart from not being able to understand a word of the lyrics, I'm not sure it really add anything to the CD.  <br /> <br />The only complaint I have is that none of the songs really stood out from the others, so while it makes relaxing background music, it didn't really grab my attention.
B00005JO1P|3.0|I've been a Johnny Cash fan all my life so it was with a mix of trepidation and excitation that I went to see this film the other day. With all the hype, I figured it would be either great or terrible, but I was wrong. Walk the Line is above average, but that is principally due to the excellence of its actors. Phoenix and Witherspoon are far more inspired than one can imagine. They pay exquisite homage to these deceased legends. It makes you want to go back and watch every documentary ever made just so you can experience the real thing. Phoenix had the great man's every idiosyncrasy down, and the way he hunches his shoulders up as he struts around during live performances was almost eerie. Outside of individual performances, the film itself was rather erratic. One should understand in advance though that this is not the life and times of Johnny Cash. It is his life in the context of his relationship with June Carter which makes it far less interesting than it otherwise would be. Really, the problem with it is that the movie skirts the line between bio and chick flick with the latter being far too pronounced. It is not great cinema but its craftsmanship and devotion to detail place it on a plane far above the rest which Hollywood usually offers.
0679423001|4.0|I happen to love English literature (serious and not-so) from the early part of the twentieth century.  This book is both wonderful and horrible--it won't be for everyone, but those in sympathy with the period will not feel they have wasted their time reading it. <br /> <br />There is no question the first part of the book--the Oxford days--is its strongest, most cohesive part.  The later sections lose that early, sharp focus. <br /> <br />The prose is truly a thing of beauty--as smooth and silky as foie gras or Belgian chocolate.  It makes one long for the days when it wasn't necessary to explain that true martinis are made with gin.  But as I turned over the last pages, I realized I despised almost every character in the book--especially those with whom I am sure I was supposed to feel sympathy.  I found the narrator to be little more than a crashing snob, although that isn't always a hindrance toward my love for a character.  Indeed, the only character I really liked was Anthony Blanche--who was disliked by most of the others, but who was the most insightful and least delusional.  Some of the even-more-minor characters are unobjectionable, but that, after all, is damning with faint <br />praise.  In spite of that, I am glad I read it and shall probably re-read it every few years. <br /> <br />A must-read for any true Anglophile, but not without its flaws.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I never thought Madonna would give us an ALL DANCE ALBUM, who could wish up something so cool? Yet she does it and delivers big time.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|The Foo Fighters latest opens the band up wider than any of their previous efforts.  Offering two discs, Dave Grohl and co. get the chance to show off both sides of their personality.  Some fans may be turned off by disc 2, which displays ten accoustic based tunes.  However, disc 1 continues in much the same hard edged, radio-friendly vein as One by One and There is Nothing Left to Lose.  On that disc, tracks such as \\"Best of You\\" and \\"DOA\\" seem familiar come chorus time, and rank up there with the Fighters' best like \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Halo.\\"  Those two, along with \\"No Way Back\\" and \\"The Deepest Blues are Black\\" are the best and most tuneful of those that rock.   <br /> <br />Disc 2 does take a while for most 10-year fans to warm up to.  After a few plays the merit of these songs are appreciated in their own right.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, many of these tracks blend together and sound very similar to one another.  The three best songs are all grouped together near the end: \\"On the Mend\\" is a hopeful ode to better days ahead, \\"Virginia Moon\\" sounds like a mid-60's crooner's classic (ala Burt Bacharach), and \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" shows off Hawkins vocal cords in front of a strong and memorable melody.  Got to give them credit, the Fighters are not afraid to stretch it out and give us something new and not necessarily commercially successful.  On the down side, these discs are copy protected, making you feel to be a less than trusted citizen.  I feel compelled to reduce the cd's rating by a half star for this reason alone.  Was it the band or record label's decision?  Whichever, Dave: you rule!

1400031087|5.0|Before all the controversy came out, I bought and started reading this book while on vacation in FL.  I found it difficult to put it down at night and by the time the ride home (8 hours) came, it was all I could do to drag myself away at a rest stop to eat lunch.  I had 20 pages to go when it became so dark (in the car) that I could not see and so I used the overhead light (much to the dissatisfaction of my husband)to finish the book. There were several points in the book where my \\"BS\\" indicator went off but the overall story was so good that I enjoyed every minute of it and was emotionally exhausted when it ended. I loved it so much that I hurried out the next week and bought \\"My Friend Leonard\\" in order to find out what happened to Lily and the author.  We are constantly reading things in today's world that turn on our internal \\"BS\\" indicators - it's up to each of us to filter what we read in this way. I look forward to additional books by this author - at the end of the day he writes well and that's what matters most. With that said, however, I will expect an honest classification of any new releases.
0753820250|5.0|This book, although it starts pretty slowly with a symbollic rather than believeable setting (a huge secret library in a land where there are no secrets), is written as a mystery with very good character development. One comes to know the main characters pretty well. The setting is Franco Spain, and the main effect conveyed repeatedly is the absolute horror of living in a fascist regime where the police can beat or kill you at will and then face no ill consequences. The police inspector, appropriately, is a psychopath.<br /><br />This review is based on the German translation 'Der Schatten des Windes', which aside from too many sentences whose length might satisfy a Hegelian philosopher, seems to be a very good one.
0793518326|5.0|Being a huge Beatles fan who plays piano and guitar, studied classical piano at Carnegie Mellon university, in addition to guitar at Carnegie Mellon, and Duquesne. I feel well qualified to say that this book is as close to the Beatles music, as actually recorded, that you can get. Some reviews complain about the small print, it is small because how can you fit all of that music on a standard size page without making it somewhat small, they could have put the music on score sheets, but scores don't sit well on shelves, in drawers, or even on the floor -- the only place they work is on a music stand. So buy this book and start learning the Best Band in history.<br /><br />Also, I don't think 'gontroppo' knows what he is talking about; \\"The Beatles Complete SCORES\\" is not a PIANO book. Thus, it has what Paul or John played on the piano, but ultimately the Beatles were guitarists; if you listen to the albums the piano is often very simple and that is why it is so effective. But this book never claimed to be a piano book, even though it does have the paino parts, along with the drums, bass and guitar; however, it did claim to be the score of the Beatles music; which it is.<br /><br />  I have a sense that gontroppo, who a lot of people said was helpful (don't listen to him) doesn't know how to read the guitar tab, or the drum and bass notation either and this is because it isn't written for the piano and why IT IS A SCORE AND NOT A  PIANO BOOK, geesh.<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK<br /><br /> -- However, if you want a PIANO book, then buy \\"The Complete Beatles\\" two volume set, it is great. These books are like the Reader's Digest music book, the Christmas one for example, because it is a simplified piano version of the Beatles music. It is great to play from, because it is easy and people can sing along with it.

B000AWYOGE|3.0|I have to agree with the average 3 star rating given to this movie by other Amazon.com customers.   I read  \\"The Dark Water\\" before watching the movie, which is based on the first short story in the book by Koji Suzuki.When I heard they were making a movie out of that story i was surprised: How could they make a two hour long flick after such a short story? And in my opinion the book has much better stories. They managed to make a decent movie out of it, however, it is not one of the best scary flicks I 've seen recently and here are the reasons why: The story is similar too the \\"Ring\\" ; a dead girl locked up in a place with lots of water comes to torment the living... Even more, this movie resembles \\"the Ring 2\\"(which was pretty bad) since the ghost wants a new mother...So nothing new, no surprises. The director managed to capture the old grim industrial landscape of Roosevelt island which makes the movie very depressing. Jennifer Connelly was also great in it, fantastic actress, can't say the same about the little girl and the guy who plays her ex ( seems he needed more diction lessons to achieve a decent American accent)  Overall, I would call this a thriller/drama instead of a horror movie since nothing scared me about it.
B000957O82|4.0|This movie was alright I expected more little bit, this is more of a chick flick, there some funny parts in this film which I laughed alot.Yes this is probably one of Will Smith's best performances but not his best movie. <br /> <br />Overall:3.7.......Coulda Been Better

6305910340|5.0|I should say up front that I have never played chess, nor do I understand the game. But I remember being intrigued about the film when I saw the theatrical trailer. Was I intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game? Was it the intense images of competition? Was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played? Or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy? The answer is all of the above. \\"Searching For Bobby Fischer\\" is an excellent family film for all. I am living proof that even those who don't know jack about chess will love this movie. It is a movie not just about chess, but about acceptance, the bond of love and friendship, compassion for others, and not being afraid to be who you want to be. The balance of drama with edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film. <br /> <br />Max Pomeranc plays the young and sensitive Josh Waitzkin, a pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp, who becomes fascinated with the \\"lower class\\" men playing chess in a New York park. He watches the men, his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces. He convinces his mother to go to the park with him, where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman. It is there that Josh's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess. Also noticing Josh is the fast-talking park chess player, Vinnie (a funny and great performance from Laurence Fishburne) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game. After a match with Josh, Josh's father (played by Joe Mantegna) realizes his son's special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named Bruce (played by Ben Kingsley) to make Josh an even better chess master. Bruce sees a young Bobby Fischer in Josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that Bobby Fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance. Through all the technical strategiesof the game being learned, Josh and Bruce develop a good friendship and with Bruce's help, combined with his own special gift, Josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies. But there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess. <br /> <br />We've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children, especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child. But what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents' mind too much? And what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you're not? These are tests that run way deeper for Josh Waitzkin than any chess tournament. Josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game. In his own way, the insightful Josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like Bobby Fischer did. In the process, Josh pushes his father and teacher's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings. It's a matter of what is more important: chess competition, or love? Through it all, the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear; love and friendship for each other no matter what. There are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture Josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain, to the visit from his teacher at the Chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show. But amongst the competition and drama, there are some nice comic scenes from Vinnie's trash talking against the others in the park, to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious, to the humorous appearance by William H. Macy when he offers to get Josh's dad a tuna sandwich.  <br /> <br />The climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where Josh takes Bruce and Vinnie's teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named Jonathan. Jonathan is a boy I feel sorry for in the film. Playing since he was four years old, all Jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face. Perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you, especially when you cannot just be a kid. <br /> <br />The acting is terrific. Ben Kingsley, Max Pomeranc and Joe Mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film. It's too bad that Pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing. A nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young Bobby Fischer talking about and playing chess with Pomeranc narrating along. It gives us a bit of the history of the world's greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when Bobby Fischer vanished; enter Josh Waitzkin. <br /> <br />\\"Searching For Bobby Fischer\\" is one of those stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well! This is a movie you'll want to watch time and time again. <br />
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Chances are if you are reading this you know who and what Cannibal Corpse is. They have crafted a great death metal album with this release. There is material on this release that is more complicated than anything they've ever done before. This is also their most consistent and diverse release. All the members are in top form, especially Alex Webster(bass) and Pat O' Brien (guitars).  <br /> <br />     The vocals are great Corpsegrinder is way better than Barnes,Both guitarists (Jack Own,Pat O' Brien) are in top form and showcase amazing technicality, Alex Webster turns in his now expected awesome performance on bass, and Paul Mazurkiewicz smashes like a madman, he's no Flo Mounier or Derek Roddy but his simple style suits CC. <br /> <br />     Some of the songs groove and are slow (Decency Defied, Festering In The Crypt) and some are really fast (Frantic Disembowlment,They Deserve To Die). There is a great mix of songwriting here because there are 3 composers. The material usually stays fresh and interesting. The three standout tracks on this release are: <br /> <br />They Deserve To Die(Alex Webster)-Strong album closer, 15 second scream towards the end, impressive.(Beat that Bruce Dickinson!!) <br /> <br />Decency Defied(Jack Owen)-Great, catchy song, the riff sticks in your head for days. <br /> <br />Frantic Disembowlment(Pat O'Brien)- INSANE technical guitars on this one, best track here. <br /> <br />Note: some versions come with a bonus DVD that is very interesting, worth the price on it's own. Can't wait for the next album Kill in stores March 21st.
B000001FS6|5.0|When I first head about this follow up album of the band to their epic JOSHUA TREE album that laminated my fondness for U2 as a young teen back then - my enthusiasm was way sky-high upscale that's nothing short of being on a stellar status, even more so when I heard it had a movie to accompany the album along. I also heard about a screenplay that's written for a short indie-feature regarding a kid who found a cd copy of the album. This double LP/Cassette comes as among those 2lp album sets that wind to fit on a single disc when it've first seen its day of being released on cd*, (whose format is still on its early popular stage at the time of this album's release (kinda like when what I could recall back when I was a little kid that neighbors would be bragging about the then-new format of \\"CompactCassette\\" tapes (as it was being called back then), 'Hey Compared to vinyl Lp's- there're no scratches! Plus you can erase it when you get tired of what's in there.' or so they'd say).    Although RATTLE AND HUM The Movie is not such a bad documentary chronicling the inception of the album while the band embark on their American Tour in support of their Classic THE JOSHUA TREE LP- I'm not as much as fond of the movie that accompanied this album, which is far greater than its motion picture counterpart.  Containing seventeen tracks, half of which are studio stuff most of which are not featured on the concert/documentary flick, such as: `Desire'; `Hawkmoon 269'; `Angel of Harlem'; `Love Rescue Me'; `When Love Comes To Town'; `Heartland'; `God Part 2'; - it also have the full version for the live-cut rendition of `I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' with the New Voices of Freedom Choir, recorded on one of their last leg for the \\"Joshua Tour\\" performances, at Madison Square Garden on the 28th of September 1987.    Also featured in the album are these live tracks that are culled from the movie: `Helter Skelter/Van Diemen's Land (a good one from the Edge I should say (theformer a take on the very first 'heavy metal' song ever created from none other than the BEATLES and Sir Paul McCartney))'; `All Along The Watchtower' (that Hendrix track written by Dylan (sounding a lot like `Silver and Gold' - a track that was originally recorded by the band for the benefit album ARTISTS AGAINST APARTHEID- that also appeared here on its live recording, with the segment of the streetpeddler's song \\"Freedom For My People\\" that began the track)); `Pride (In The Name Of Love)'; and the only studio track that's fully featured on the film used as the background for its credits following the previous track by the end of the film- one of their epic tracks `All I Want Is You'.      'Twas The Edge who's playing the guitar on the cover by the way, taken from that segment where the guitar solo (a backward rendition of the funeral bugle march tune?) for 'Bullet the Blue Sky' is being performed; and it's quite a curio though that Bono who held the spotlight for The Edge happen to look like Freddie Kruger in the way the pixels on the pic went which gave that effect .   Furthermore I wonder a little bit why'd they have the lyrics to the song `Heartland' printed on both the lyrics sleeve as well's on the album jacket. Anyhow, the album is best listened to with the tracks' sequence as follows (track #'d accd. to disc)=    15/16) THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER/BULLET THE BLUE SKY    1/2/3) HELTER SKELTER/ VAN DIEMEN'S LAND/ DESIRE    5/6/7/8/9) ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER/ I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR/ Freedom For My People/ SILVER AND GOLD/ PRIDE (IN THE NAME OF LOVE)    14) GOD PART II     4) HAWKMOON 269 [w/ Bob Dylan on keyboards]    13) HEARTLAND    12) WHEN LOVE COMES TO TOWN [with B.B. KING]    11) LOVE RESCUE ME [w/ Bob Dylan on background vocals]    10) ANGEL OF HARLEM    17) ALL I WANT IS YOU      Furthermore, around this period - the late Roy Orbison (who've then teemed with the first incarnation of the HARRISON/PETTY/LYNN collaboration called The Travelling Wilbury's with Bob Dylan (who co-wrote the track `Love Rescue Me' with Bono)) had also written a track with the band which never came around for this album.   The song `Hawkmoon 269' by the way is a good one; 'Heartland'  seem to give an introductory idea about what U2 would eventually evolve into sound-wise within the next following years to come, in particular by the next album that followed - the ACHTUNG BABY Lp, minus the techno flavouring.     RATTLE AND HUM The Album is a worthy follow up to The Joshua Tree - which conclude U2's second phase; commencing on to what boiled up for their semi-techno crud that came about by the nineties.      Pretty good. RATE: 10    * same case with STING's NOTHING LIKE THE SUN (another effort that's been sighted/slighted as 'pretentious' by some)- and could've been done similarly with his BRING ON THE NIGHT live album, which'd been recently released along with its accompanying movie on DVD (hope they'd package RATTLE AND HUM in the similar manner as well - along with the reissue version of the album complete with interviews as the second disc for the package).    Hey! incidentally - this happens to be the 100th review for the album here at Amazon.com :)
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Like the movie I loved the original theatre release version. This version gives both the original release, plus in addition the 4 separate individual undelying stories thus giving an added entirely different twist to the movie. With 2 versions you choose which one you want to see. So you can't go wrong. It's amazing & exciting to see so many of the comic book hereos of the past come back to life!!
B00000DFSK|1.0|I mean, wow! This really deserves a star as they actually managed to put SONGS on this cd! That must've been a really hard job for the compilers to do so, -phew-!!

0307276902|3.0|doesn't the world have anything better to do than to scrutinize <br />  a few inconsequential facts that the author misrepresented in <br />  the book?  I think that all this hype is petty..so what? In <br />  a memoir things will be altered or changed, unless you want <br />  to open yourself up for a law suit...this isn't a history <br />  book..it is the story about someones life experience..not <br />  everything is going to be told exactly as happened...is it <br />  ever in life?  Do you really believe that every memoir that has <br />  ever been written has been 100% accurate?  If you do, then <br />  you are deluded.  so why persecute this author?  Why not dig <br />  up the dirt on all the other authors that have written memoirs?
0790731509|5.0|The untamed human spirit was so many times tested in the WW2. The admirable epic vein, expressed as bold courage, the seminal resistance forged by the most abominable infra human conditions, would experience a certain delay in the Fifties due, perhaps the wounds were too recent to allow the soul, the memory and the artistic vein could describe with demolishing realism the unsaid horrors.<br /><br />Cold hand Luke expresses, precisely this admirable condition of the human being; when a man is submitted to the most abject and repulsive conditions. Paul Newman gave one of his most arresting performances in the screen (after The Hustler, to my mind) and George Kennedy is splendid too with this fabulous script.<br /><br />Two additional films in that decade, would make to ignite the stage around this subject: Sidney Lumet ` s The Hill and Artur Penn ` s Little big man.<br /><br />This is by far, the masterpiece of Stuart Rosenberg.<br /><br />One more thing: if you are really interested in this subject and try to seek for the most relevant and pyramidal statement about it then, go for A man escaped of Robert Bresson: there is no way out.

B000AJJNOK|4.0|50 Cent's \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" was an instant blockbuster when it was released in 2003; becomeing one of the biggest debuts in the history of hip-hop. For everything that sounded standard, there was something about the album that made it seem fresh, different and vibrant; nothing exemplified this more than the infectious, smooth \\"In Da Club\\"; the \\"most listened to song\\" in Billboard history. After that huge hit, and all the G-Unit-click works inspired by it, it was only reasonable that 50 Cent's sophomore album would be an event. For starters, let it be said that \\"The Massacre\\" avoids the sophmore slump. It may not raise the stakes like Alicia Keys' \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\" or Kanye West's \\"Late Registration\\", but it is a worthy follow up to mega-blockbuster. Big name producers are far and few (Dr. Dre, Scott Storch, Eminem) as most tracks are rom lesser knowns. Everything holds up pretty well, and the album will not dissapiont loyal G-Unit fans. It goes without saying that the disc inspired a few large hits:  - \\"Candy Shop\\" (feat. Olivia) A. Of the four sinlges here, this one comes the closest to equaling \\"In Da Club\\". Scott Storch's production does a terrific job of creating a slick, mesmerizing beat that hold your ears for every second. And like Petey Pablo's \\"Freek-A-Leek\\", the lyrics are cool and catchy despite their higly explicit content; it may not be \\"nice\\", but they create memorable images. This is one of the year's best rap songs.  - \\"Outta Control\\" (Remix feat. Mobb Deep) B-. This is a good track, that just lacks the flow and beats which make 50's songs work. It feels rather toned down compared to his earlier works. Still, it's nice to hear Mobb Deep on their new label, and 50 himself does half some charismatic lyrics. It's not a bad song, but one that leaves you wanting a bit more. The remix is an minor improvment over the original.*  - \\"Disco Inferno\\" B+. This is a highly, infectious party track, that is pefect for a summer anthem; yet whenever Ihear it, I'm always reminded of another G-Unit production: Lloyd Banks' \\"On Fire\\". That single was incredibly fun, catchy and cool (not mention used to perfection in \\"Fantastic Four\\" (2005)); and this sinlge seems to be borrowing a little too much from that one. To be fair, both were written and produced by 50. That said, I'll be reasonable and give this the exact same rating as \\"On Fire\\".  - \\"Just A Little Bit\\" B. Overall, it lacks the vibe and edge  of \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\", yet 50 still makes it work mainly due to his charisma. Many other rappers could not drop these rhymes with conviction, but 50 Cent can: the words sound natrual as they floiw from his mouth. Not a great work from the G-Unit label, but a good one.  Those were the singles, but there are some other notable tracks as well. \\"This Is 50\\" is cool, slick rap which serves as a single to define just WHO 50 Cent is; meancing and polished at the same exact time. Other noteable selection's include the Eminem collaboration \\"Gatman and Robbin'\\"; a nice little companion to Eminem's \\"Business\\" (off 2002's \\"The Eminem Show\\"), and \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is a new side of 50: one with more power, meaning and depth as it tells a harrowing tale of Heroine-addicted girlfriend. And lastly, \\"Build You Up\\" (feat. Jamie Foxx) provides a lighter (for 50 atleast) tone that creates a more relaxing feel; while the same time cementing Jamie Foxx's status a 100% legitimate singer. It really is a nice surprise to find on the album.   Bottom Line: ***1/2. This is a very solid, and totally acceptable sophomore album; not a dissapiontment like Chingy's \\"Powerballin'\\". It may not reach the EXACT status as \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\", but it's probuably too much to expect lightning to strike twice. What the album does do is prove that 50 Cent is a true force in hip-hop, and someone who is going to be around for quite some time. This is the best rap album of 2005.  *NOTE: The \\"Outta Control\\" (Remix feat. Mobb Deep) is onlyavailable on Special Edition CD/DVD. The Special Edition adds more pints to the album by including not only the remix, but a DVD containing the videos for all 21 songs, and trailers for bothe the \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" movie and \\"Bulletproof\\" video game. It really is a great deal.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|Culkin and Greens acting is very good, once you understand the shallowness and superficiallity of the characters, and the egotistical peronallities that are portrayed. <br /> <br />The movie shows the \\"glamorous\\" side of being a party kid, the popularity, the money.....and the lack of values, the lack of any parental guidance,self destruction, the twisted motivations, a downward spiral of the \\"american dream\\".  <br /> <br />A photograph of the 80's /90's, and the quest for monetary success, fame,recognition,for a group of teens who had too much, too soon.  <br /> <br />It gives you the lives of two boys in particular, who had a certain artistic brilliance, which could have trascended in pop culture, but developed in to worthless lives.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This Sci-Fi action show may not have had phasors and strange aliens with protruding forheads but it had a great cast and a twisting plot. The creators made this series futuristic while still holding onto present day roots. People carried guns, with metal bullets, there was crime in the streets, and a crew had to do whatever they could to work to the next paycheck. Picking up a few interesting characters along the way made this a great series that was cut short. Thankfully the feature film, Serenity, did it justice and gave Firefly fans one last thrill.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I first heard this music on a flight from chicago to las vegas. I had just had the worst experience of my life and I was messed up in the head. I was in pain mentally. Then this music came on and it literally soothed that pain. It made me forget for at least that moment what I had been through. I wrote down the name Celtic Woman and about two weeks later spotted the cd. It really is beautiful and it is for anyone. I recommend it especially to people who may need cheering up. It brought a smile to my face during the worst of times and I will be forever grateful for that.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I must say I can't remember the last time I was affected so much by a movie. The story, acting, and visuals were superb, nearly every frame of this movie is elegant and beautiful. But the best was saved for the last. The ending is one of the most perfect put on film, subtle yet devastating in its emotional power.
B00005AQE8|3.0|This album is a good album. The production is pretty good, the guest appearances go well with Pac( Method Man, Redman, Big Syke, Outlaws, Daz, Kurupt) and Pac maintains a decent flow. However his subject matter on this album strays from a more focused and serious Pac to the full fledged thug. The subject matter of All Eyez on Me does not equal up to the level of his previous efforts such as Me Against the World, and 2Pacalypse Now. Once again, a pretty good album for beats and to bump in the car, but Pac left the focused, thought provoking lyrics in exchange for the thug.
0440241588|5.0|Today I completed \\"The Broker\\" by John Grisham. It was excellent! I felt like I had slipped away from Burlington, KY and was taken captive into a new set of surroundings with a new identification. It was as if I became a shadow of the main character, Joel Backman, on every part of his journey, from: expensive unscrupulous attorney, to prison, to pardon, to Italy. Backman had to play grown-up hide-and-seek or risk life and limb. He outwitted his enemies by playing their game better than they played it. A similar television show is Alias. My mind's eye enjoyed the privilege of picturing the surroundings and the action. I highly recommend this book, if you are looking for a mental vacation that reads like a suspense/action movie.
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|As a lover of all Disney films it was a no-brainer that I would be drawn to this movie.  But I must confess that the last few live action releases from Disney have been less than \\"super\\".<br /><br />So it was refreshing to see Disney hit a homerun this time with \\"Sky High\\".<br /><br />The last few years we have seen a large amount of super hero movies, from Spider man to the Incredibles, and while they all use the time honored tradition of super powers these new ones tap into an element I would call the \\"humaness of the supers\\".  We see their flaws and troubles, and it helps the viewer relate a little more to the world we see on the screen.<br /><br />We've even seen pop groups tap into this, if you haven't heard the song by Five for Fighting called \\"Superman\\" with the catch line \\"it's not easy to be me\\" you need to hear it!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.  The struggle between the \\"heros\\" and \\"the sidekicks\\" is strangely familiar, and the expectations  the super hero parents have for their children is also true to this life.<br /><br />Teenagers will like this, as will children and parents.  And it might even spur on some conversations between parents and children about some of the struggles they have.<br /><br />Please pick this movie up!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|The only way I can think of to describe Serenity would be a \\"laid back\\" movie that was well aware of its core audience, and well aware of ways to exploit its own genre, in a positive way.<br /><br />The crew of the Serenity is being trailed by the Alliance due to the fact that they are harboring a psychic girl with unknown powers.  In what seemed like an anti-big government screed, the movie presents the Alliance as an all powerful, corrupted, invasive government that tries to control every aspect of the life in the new solar system.  River, the psychic girl, knows some secret that the Alliance has been keeping from its citizens; a secret that could cause the whole thing to come crashing down.  So the alliance sends its best assassin after the girl, and the whole crew of the Serenity.  The assassin, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is one of the best villains I have seen in a movie in quite a long time.  A lot of that is thanks to his acting, but also thanks to the writing of Joss Whedon.  The writing in this movie is amazing.  Whedon does an amazing job of giving each character their own distinct personality.  Each Serenity crew member adds something, and by the end of the movie, you are really rooting for the crew as a family.  The dialogue is interesting, not overdone, and extremely funny in some parts.<br /><br />The action is cool.  Yeah, there are some cheesy parts.  But you are rooting for the good guys so much, you just don't care how cheesy it is.  Near the end, I was almost standing up yelling at the TV for crew of the Serenity to fight their way out of the situation.  Technically, the movie is also very well-done.  The special effects are pretty dang cool.  The one real \\"battle\\" scene in the movie provides some amazing visuals, with the Serenity spinning out of control down through the atmosphere in the middle of a huge battle between the Alliance and the Reavers.<br /><br />Like I said, I never watched Firefly, but now I feel like it might be worth a shot.  In the least, I think that Joss Whedon is an amazingly talented up-and-coming filmmaker.  I can't wait for his next movie, I hope some studio will give him the opportunity to really create another vision of his like he did with this film.hot.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|The debate about when we will get a \\"proper\\" beatles hits collection is old and tired. The answer is : Never! There have been several now (A Collection Of Beatles Oldies But Goldies, 20 Greatest Hits, Red and Blue albums, rock and roll music, past masters volumes 1 and 2, and this one). You will never have a \\"true\\" hits album, because what and what not should be on it is open to opinion from all fans and will differ from fan to fan and therefore it is impossible to do. The only way you can get a true sample of the best of the beatles is to buy each and everyone of their studio albums and the two past masters collections, then you have everything they did from 1962 to 1970! If you think a true album will ever be issued, you're in never land! So the conclusion is settle for this, the red album, or the blue album, as these are the closest you will get, or buy the whole back catalogue.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|It is a very subtle movie, something which you want to watch on a calm day and just relax. <br /> <br />It is about these two people: One is a young bored woman in a Hotel, who tries to spend time by ikebana, spending time at the bar, smoking(which her husband hates) and an elderly man who is feeling lost in Japanese culture. And how they try to get along on a common thread. <br /> <br />Some of the scenes looks to be making fun of the Japanese:  But they are not, cultural differences always makes one look funnier and weird when compared to the other. <br /> <br />Having been to Korea, I feel that the translation scenes were  exactly the same as what we practically experience.  I used to go to these meetings where my customer would talk what seemed to me like 10 lines and the translator would explain to me in 1 line and then I would ask her 'Are you sure - thats all what he said ?' <br />These are some of the things which have been very well captured in the movie. <br /> <br />The background Music is great, goes very well with the movie.
B000002UA9|5.0|Many people say this wasn't one of the best beatles albums, to that i say , right ok, whatever you say. This is a great album. The recording budget may have been cheaper than what the label would later spend and the recordings somewhat rushed to get an album out \\"while the beatles were still hot\\", but i listen a lot to this album, infact i listen to it more than Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. <br /> <br />This is a classic and along with \\"With The Beatles\\" probably gives a better insight to the early beatles than the red album ever could. <br /> <br />
B00005JKOI|5.0|\\"Pretty in Pink\\" is the story about a young high school girl, who receives the attention of a young yuppie played by Andrew McCarthy, who drives a BMW and comes from a very rich family. Despite, the fact that Andrew's character's friends don't like MOlly Ringwald's character because she's from the \\"other side of the tracks\\" they decide to throw caution to wind and date each other.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald plays an outcast and dates the popular, rich kid, named Andy (Andrew McCarthy).<br /><br />The plot is easy to follow and entertaining.<br /><br />It's definitely a good movie; especially, if you love 80's music. The music in the film is great as are the characters.<br /><br />An interesting character played by Annie Potts is Molly Ringwald's older friend, who acts as her female confidante and offers Molly advice on dating.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for anyone aged 13 or over.<br /><br />It's a great movie--it's fun to rent or to even buy!

B000002UJQ|1.0|I am only kidding, this album isn't worth 1 star. But how can I get you all to read all these words I am typing right now if I give it the 2 or 3 stars I think it really deserves? You see the 1 star and you want to read on to see how on earth such a dork could award this \\"masterpiece\\" such a low score! Plus, there are some people who give it 5 star reviews without really meaning it, so it evens out in the end. <br /> <br />I liked Ok Computer when I was 15 in 1997, it was so futuristic and I had never heard of something like it. At the time I was into bands like Guns N Roses, Led Zeppelin, Queen, etc.. and it was the time that I really listened to some real music. Yeah. Radiohead. One of the greatest rock bands of all time, and Ok Computer is their magnum opus. A true masterpiece. One of the defining moments in music history. The fuzzy guitar that opens \\"airbag\\" is sooo haunting! I could see the genius of that! The accoustic guitars of \\"Paranoid Android\\" are sooo bautifully played!! In fact, the whole album has a low feel that it can make you really go to sleep when you're not even tired. <br /> <br />That's all great. But that's when I was 15. Unfortuantly, hearing this album 9 years later, I dont beleive there's anything groundbreaking or even good about Ok Computer. The fuzzy guitar intro of Airbag sounds like it's stolen from Rolling Stones' \\"Satsifaction\\" masterpiece. Ahh, Radiohead, trying to steal the famous riff made by Keith Richard. These guys are helpless and talentless. I would go even far into saying that Radiohead is simply a less anthemic U2. Nothing more. Nothing less. I doubt if anyone really enjoys this album, because hearing it at the age of 24, It nearly bored me to tears. The album has no sense of melodic structure whatever, I could even imagine Thom Yorke sleeping in the studio saying to band members \\"dont make it all melodic and all, that's for commercial bands.\\" At the end, I dont beleive people like this album because the music is GREAT. Dont get me wrong, some Radiohead songs (Creep) are good songs, but I could list a hundred band who have written good songs. People mainly like this album because of its structure, its presentation. Not because the music is great. There's a difference. <br /> <br />These days I dont take Radiohead seriously. I've outgrown them to the point I can't stand looking at their album covers. Now when people tell me about the genius of Ok Computer and Radiohead, it just makes me smile from inside because I know they dont actually beleive it. But everyone reading this review is probebly a die hard Radiohead fan who wants my body to the devil for not giving it 5 stars anyways.
B00005JKG9|5.0|The movie is an explosive adaptation of David Mamet's play and a true showcase of the art of writing and acting. The very bread and butter of film for your viewing delight, some of the biggest names in contemporary cinema in a fantastic ensemble performance. This also contains what I consider to be the most powerful 5 minutes of Alec Baldwin's entire career and one of the greatest monologues in movie history in my humble opinion. I frequently mouth these lines to my friends' great irritation. Exceptionally brilliant writing, knock-out performances by an all-star cast.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|I have seen the original Dark Water and it kept me on the edge of my seat!! But this no-name director turned that great asian flick into a HBO-sunday-matinee-family-movie. Now they lure the money out of your pockets with an \\"unrated edition\\". Exuse me? WHAT exactly was there to be rated in the first place? NOTHING. This movie is absolutely NOT scary at all. The actors are simply too cute looking to be scary. All the scary effects from the original movie where simply left out! I have seen dozens of asian new-horror ghost flicks and believe me, this remake simply is not worth buying, renting or even watching! Please go watch the original Dark Water, you won't be dissappointed!!
6304493681|5.0|Animation for grown-ups. Plain and simple. Spectacular visualizations and conceptualizations and engrossing story-lines make this one of the most thoroughly conceived works in cinematic animation and an instant classic. The subsequent series, Stand Alone Complex fleshes out the concept more with rich storylines and a fitting soundtrack. Great art, splendid scifi, kickass cyber punk at the cutting edge.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|A priest is accused of murdering a young 19-year-old girl, Emily Rose.  Some say she had epilepsy.  Others say Emily was physiologically unwell.  Some even say that she had a mixture of both.  Emily, in fact, was possessed by evil spirits, and she was taking medication to help her.  The priest who came to do the exorcism on her told her to stop using the drugs and focus on religion to help cure the evil in her.  This, however, didn't work.  It made her case worse, and she ended up dying just to escape the spirits. <br /> <br />The girl who played the part of Emily Rose was outstanding; I was really convinced that she was actually possessed and not playing a part.  Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, a lawyer, who defends the priest. <br /> <br />This movie mainly takes place in the courtroom, where witnesses tell their side of the story, which intern flashbacks to the scenes of where Emily is alive. <br /> <br />There is a lot of dialogue in this movie, and some may consider it boring.  I found the storyline very interesting and well written.  <br />
0671004107|5.0|I actually saw the movie before I read the book, so was partially biased through that experience, but in spite of it, I was enthralled by the sheer brilliance on display in Contact. A brilliant story, challenging, stimulating and tightly-written, it's speculative science fiction at it's very best.
B000028U0Y|5.0|this has to be the greatest live cd ever put out.  of course san quentin is a close second.  just for all that emotion that he gave for all the prisoners.  he could have gone out and did a half-assed job, but thats not how Mr Cash went out and did it. this is one that must be added to your collection.  and to that guy that bashed this cd, Johnny did go to prison but when he recorded this he was not a prisoner.  you should get your facts right before you say something bad about something that you have no right to talk about.
0679735259|5.0|This tiny book packs an incredible punch. Herr wasn't just in Vietnam, Herr lived Vietnam. He breathed it and drank it in and it consumed him and devoured him in turn and this remarkable writing is a spectacular expression of that experience and, as mentioned, a direct influence of two signature Vietnam War movies, and arguably, two of the greatest war movies ever committed to film. Among Vietnam novels I have read, Dispatches stands alone without equal. <br /> <br />The current crop of Iraq books are one-after-the-other being compared to Dispatches which is not only an insufferable insult to the original, but a revelation of modern book marketing. Empty shrill hype pimping pulp flotsam. IF an equal to Dispatches ever ever emerges from this current mess, it will be several years after the war and by a participant skilled in the beauty of our language, and not some bureaucrat adrenaline junky.
0790729407|5.0|This movie is not for the tender hearted, and if you are you will ball your eyes out about how evil violence is when done on other people.  the cost of freedom is to high and so many lives are taken by murder and hatred. War is just evil and there is no justification or excuse for such violence. if you can learn from this movie not to hate and get involved in violence then you understood the movie correctly. i hate hatred and murder not matter what and it is sad this stuff really happened. This movie is based on true history and fact when it comes to ireland becoming indpendent from england and how evil and brutal the english really are and how the irish including myself were affected by that cruelty so badly that it caused a whole war in ireland against the british nazi occupation of the emerald isle. this is true to the heart. England had never been in ireland or involved with ireland there would have been no IRA. England created the violence in ireland not the other way around. Eamon de valera said and i quote \\"better to die as martyrs for freedom than to be the ones who make martyrs like the english\\" ' He did not have the stomach for violence and hatred but he had more heart about how to handle the situation. He admitted it was his downfall and felt guilty of michael collins his great friend's death.  Hopefully God willing we can learn from this movie and from Jesus Christ's own words is to \\"love your enemies and do righteousness (good) towards them\\" <br /> there is no love and righteousness when you murder people. <br /> Rabbi Nachman from the Soviet Union said \\"Our best weapon that G'd gave us is prayer not guns\\"
0684833395|5.0|Without hesitation one of the finest books on war ever written. Painfully funny, fantastically intricate, deviously corrupting, Catch-22 is the standard by which all other books are measured. The first time I read Catch-22 I cried from laughter, and from the bitter truths expounded through the riotous characters Heller created here. An American classic.
0525948023|5.0|yes, this book is super. Also, watching his DVDs are even more awakening. i got 22 of his DVDs and enjoy them greatly. when driving i listen to his CDs. Its being the most refreshing last 4 months, compare to rest of my life. i am truely awakened to my own unconsiousness and now live much much more conscious life. yes i still have bad days.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is a strong album with several high energy and well written songs. The old school electronica instrumentation with hard edge guitars and arrangement is tops as is the songwriting and lyrics.<br /><br />Not every song is a winner, the album starts off with lots of energy and then seems to taper off a bit(the worst songs are the last ones). But all in all, it's a great album for any DM or electronic music fan. I especially like the overall sound and vibe to the CD, high energy, retro, dark, introspective yet catchy.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is the first album by A7X i've heard so i have no basis to compare it with their past work as some other reviews have. However as an introduction to a new band I was totally blown away by this record. I was expecting it to be alot like typical modern american metal: heavy riffs with a hardcore band singer and a stock solo here and there. No where to be found here. I was kind of confused by the punk rock progressions in the chorus of track 1 and in the beginning of track 2 but what's this? Vocal harmonies? Melodic guitar harmonies? Ripping solos and interplaying guitar work? And holy crap! I can actually hear the bass! Once you get into the album you realize this is a rare masterpiece of music. Atypical of most metal today, there is hardly any screaming, well planned melodic progressions and unique lead guitar tones that are a throw back to people like Slash but yet maintain a modern edge when it comes to rhythm. At the same time you also have nice tight double bass, fast guitars and unique singing/lyrics. Each song is within a style that this band totally owns but also very different from each other. \\"Seize the Day\\" I could've sworn was a Guns 'n Roses song. Lots of similarities to \\"Don't Cry\\" but definately all original. Best band I've heard in a long while and this album became one of my favorites overnight. I hightly recommend it.
0440180295|5.0|I read Slaughterhouse-Five for one of my English classes and fell in love with Vonnegut's writing. It was such a strange book but it was so entertaining. <br /> <br />Similar to the concept of The Matrix, Vonnegut makes you wonder what's real and what's dream as the main character drifts back and forth between his own time in World War II and other sub-realities of different times, both before and after he lived. Vonnegut's writing is so solid, however, that you don't feel pushed too hard or fast. This is especially important given the strange story. <br /> <br />Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the best books I've ever read and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to stretch their minds.
B0007XT87G|3.0|I got into this band because I was told they were similar to Opeth whom I love. I got Absentia first and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't heavy music but it reminded me of Pink Floyd so I kept listening. I was pleased with several of the tracks and soon after bought Deadwing. I found that it was more of the same. A little more focused and more tracks that I liked. Fans of Dream Theatre, Floyd, Rush, Journey or any other classic or progressive rock should like this. Metalheads like myself may not get as much out of it.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Who said this album ain't no good? Are they deaf or what?
B000068TPN|5.0|Every now and again, movies depicting factual events (Saving Private Ryan, JFK, We Were Soldiers, Windtalkers, et al) are either vilified or praised.  Depending on how well you value historical accuracy VS creative liberties, the movie you are watching could be the best or the worst.   <br />Pvt Ryan didn't exist; according to some of the Navajo Windtalkers-the movie of the same name had a few \\"Hollywood Moments\\".  Point is, there's probably no movie out there without a few liberties taken here and there in the script.  Email me one or two (with verifiable examples) and then you will have a definite discussion on your hands. <br /> <br />Either way, WWS made my then-fiance cry after the final battle scene, once Moore (Gibson) placed his foot on the copter and gave the field a final once over.  This is a fantastic movie that shows (finally), how the North Vietnamese tactics were utilized to try to cut off supply lines, and so on.  From what I read from the book; which I read before even production wrapped up on the movie (I finished the book about two weeks before the first trailers were released in the theatres), Moore and Plumbley were accurately protrayed as gritty career soldiers that wanted to win.  The \\"stand up while everyone else is down\\" is the way one is supposed to be when directing troops on the field.  This way, the Colonel (or Sgt Major) can get an overview of the situation.   <br /> <br />Moore is a booksmarts Colonel.  You can gather that from the constant studying of Custer's Last Stand, the Battle of French Indochina massacre, and the capabilites of the Huey.  He also brings up a story about a Native American brought up by the whole village.  The meaning behind it is clear.   <br /> <br />From an interview from Randall Wallace roughly two months after the movie was released: \\"....Harold Moore is portrayed in the script as a larger-than-life leader who seemed to always make the right move. In a newspaper interview the real Harold Moore was quoted assaying that he would have liked John Wayne to play him, indeed. But what supports this presentation in the script is the book. I know, he wrote the book, and could present himself any damn way he wanted. But when you read the book, you get the sense of a humble, honest, and heroic solider who was not going to let his men down, he would rather face death then face the widow of a solider who he did not return home from the battlefield, dead or alive. He wasn't trying to be a hero, but just doing his job....\\"  <br /> <br />Not only does WWS show the first major skirmish of the Vietnam Conflict, but it also shows the overall effects of the wives.  The letters, the angst over a falsified address, etc.  It tugs at the heart when you see the one black woman almost refusing to accept the telegram.  You don't get that in most other war movies; nor do you see the wives interact with each other.  A friend of mine compared the living room scene early in the movie to a meeting of wives and girlfriends at a Reserve Center Base or Training Grounds.   <br /> <br />The only \\"Hollywood\\" moment I really saw was the Joe Galloway montage during Day 3.   <br /> <br />Sgt Savage had the hardest job in the world.  He had no formal training, nor did he even want the job of troop leader when both his Lt's died.  But he did a remarkable job in helping his fellow soldiers through an extremely trying day and a half at the Knoll.   <br /> <br />This is a \\"Flag Waver\\"...but in sticking to the American style of moviemaking...one must keep with a happy and warm ending.   <br />Watch Darkman or Basic Instinct for examples of endings that don't quite gel with most people. <br /> <br />Rent it...or better yet, buy it...and crank the speakers to 11.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Congratulations Madonna! You've done a great great job for your latest album. I'm just enthralled by it. How could you come up with  a song like Forbidden Love?
0143034901|2.0|This book was so hailed by reviewers I trust - now I think everyone is afraid to tell the truth. A crashing bore of a book, it moves sluggishly along, trying to be a heady page-turner - made my brain feel as though it had been explosed to a drying agent.
B00006LLOG|5.0|Lou Reed's self-titled solo debut, released in early 1972, is often overlooked; in fact, it was an interesting and creative album that had some strong points. On his own, unfortunately, Lou didn't quite manage to recreate the magic of his days with the Velvet Underground, and the album wasn't up to the Velvets' standards; it was a commercial disappointment. He might have released a few more forgettable albums, and been remembered for his days with the Velvets, his solo career being more or less dismissible. However, only a few months later, with help from David Bowie and Mick Ronson, Lou proved that he had what it takes to make it alone. <br /> <br />Transformer became an instant classic, and is considered one of the most important and influential and important albums of the 70's to this day, for many reasons. It was the combination of Reed's and Bowie's talents that made it work - because, although the songs are all Reed's, Bowie's mark is all over them. And yet, although the sound sounds remarkably like Bowie's work at the time, there's none of the otherworldly glamour of Ziggy Stardust - instead, Reed uses Bowie's glam to paint a realistic, sad, ironic and affectionate picture of life in Lower East Side New York and the Warhol crowd in the late 60's and early 70's. The combination of these elements created a very unique style, and earthly, street-wise cabaret, half American and half European,  that made Transformer stand out. That style is best portrayed in the album's biggest hit - 'Walk on the Wild Side' - a song that tells the stories of some of the characters who wandered these streets in those years, and Reed tells these stories in an intimate and sympathetic and yet humorous and ironic way, with very clever lyrics like only he could write. Bowie's pop sensitivities helped make the song very radio-friendly, and with a great little riff and brilliant bass work by Klaus Voorman, 'Walk on the Wild Side' became an instant classic that would linger on long afterits subjects were forgotten. <br /> <br />It's not the only gem on the album. Transformer is the kind of album that sounds almost like a greatest hit collection. 'Perfect Day' is Reed's most popular ballad, and a very sharp and ironic song, that lost its edge over the years but can still move today. Even if you look past the sarcastic lyrics, it's a truly beautiful song, and a hauntingly dark one. 'Satellite of Love', the third biggest hit off the album, is another pop masterpiece, a gorgeous song that has Bowie's fingerprints all over it. Seamy songs like 'Make Up' and 'New York Telephone Conversation' give us a twisted and ironic look on the Warhol troupe and life in New York in the early 70's, while 'Hangin' Round', 'Wagon Wheel', 'Vicious' and 'I'm So Free' are all-out rock tracks, all precise and catchy as can be. 'Andy's Chest' is a redefinition of a song from the Velvet Underground days, that leaves the original far behind and proves beyond doubt that Reed is back on his feet. <br /> <br />'Goodnight Ladies' is perhaps the most personal song on the album and one of the best, and the one that best contains the special blend of New York and Europe that this album excels in. 'Goodnight Ladies' is classic cabaret, seductive and teasing, and yet it's fixated perfectly in Lower East Side New York, and gives a strong feeling of the loneliness of big-city life. All through the track you can imagine Reed on a dimly lit stage, smoking a cigarette and in his sleepers and undershirt, unshaven and just a bit drunk; the song is a perfect closing number, which compliments the atmosphere of the entire album, and leaves the listener smiling sadly and entirely satisfied. <br /> <br />Musically and lyrically, I actually consider Transformer Lou's second best album - second to Berlin, his strongest and most uncompromising album, released one year later. But where Berlin explores and experiments, Transformer is confident and precise, and in many ways it is a more complete and more perfect album, perfect like only a handful of albums through the ages have managed to be. Both Transformer and Berlin are in my opinion essential listening, but Transformer is probably the best album to start your Lou Reed collection with.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|<br />Honestly, the only thing that got on my nerves in the movie was when the stupid American client ws in the locker room and the little slut tricked the last surviving backbacker down the hallway.  But they all got what was coming to them at the end and he spared no one. <br /> <br />Really, the movie was truly bad.  From the lighting to the acting.  Especially the female actors and the Icelander guy.  But guy who was torturing the poor last survivor was truly a creepy, ugly looking man.   <br /> <br />As for the violence, I guess I am sick or something.  All the blood and gore didn't bother me.  The movie was tedius and long and as for the revenge scenes, what revenge? <br /> <br />The kid just shoots them or hacks them here and there.  Like man, wouldn'd you, especially with the girl, take your extra sweet time and not just cut off her legs and arms, but like a$$ f*ck her with the chainsaw and cut out her c*nt--after raping her a few times I mean?  Sure you would. <br /> <br />The girls too were kind of ugly honestly.  No real t*ts and the characters annoying.  I was just happy to see them get killed off but even 90 minutes the movie was too long because of how boring it was. <br /> <br />I really didn't like it overall and thought the story was just too dumb.  Like bodies were literally piling up and there all these people torturing people and stuff everywhere and no one seems to notice this all happening or that the people are missing.  \\"Like hi mom and dad, I'll be at the Slovakian Hostel.\\"  Two days later... \\"Hmm, we haven't heard back from Johnny...  Gee, I guess I'll just write him off and never wonder what happened.\\"  Now multiple that by hundred times a month the way the bodies were piling up in the movie and surely business would not be thriving as the authorities would have closed there a$$es a long time. <br /> <br />But there you go...  That was the story.  And BTW, the supposed \\"real events\\" that inspired the movie was like some internet scam advertising you could kill someone if you flew down to like Tailand.   <br /> <br />It's a dumb movie and not worth the movie trip.  Wait for the rental if you want to see it. <br /> <br />Wolf Creek by the way was way more scary and creepy. <br /> <br />
0823023494|5.0|A great book and a great learning tool!  I reconmend this book for pros and hackers alike.  The examples are great and easy to understand and the book is a good read too!  Simply a must for any cartoonist/artist in any field of illustration. A good companion with animation books like \\"Animate the Looney Tunes way\\" or the Preson Blair series on animation.
B00005JOII|4.0|This is a terrific tragedy, in the same league as Allen's best drama, Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). <br /> <br />It's a very small-scale, long-frame movie about a young man who, looking about for a way to break into the world and become a substantial person, finds himself taken off track by physical passion for the girlfriend of his benefactor.  Should he marry for friendly love and security, or lose everything for romantic lust?  It would be an easier decision if it were more than lust, but that's never clear.  His cup is half full and his indecision leads to an affair, which blows up in his face. <br /> <br />He then makes a fateful moral decision which defines his whole existence, perhaps not the right one.. either way he's selling his soul and suffers terribly for it in a way that only Woody can convey.  It's heartbreaking. <br /> <br />The only limitation is Woody Allen, who's been around for decades and has an already well-defined range or style so that you can't expect something truly brand-new, but he's such a wonderful artist (when he isn't misfiring) that this is forgiven. Scarlett Johannsen stars as the luminous, over-ripe beauty, a magnetic presence to everyone around her.
0553801503|1.0|a 1000 page book that should have been 300pages <br />As a big fan of GRRM first 3 books in this series I was VERY unhappy with this boring book.  <br />It's long, slow and lacking focus.   He introduces a bunch of new characters, but these new people are so caught up in playing \\"the game of thrones\\" it's difficult to get any character depth or backstory out of them (so we end up caring very little about them).  <br />  Worse the few chapters in this book dedicated to the characters we are already attached to are rarely dramatic or fantastic:    <br />i.e. learn how to be a fish monger in venice... or get a firm understanding of tedium of traveling along the kings road. <br /> <br />I would suggest waiting for the paperback version, and then reading only the jamie chapters.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Oh I wanted to like this.  I'm a big fan of everyone in this thing and I'm utterly surprised that they managed to take such a big budget and make such a huge mangled wreckage-heap of a film, limping off the screen as all these guys finally threw up their hands and gave up on this sad mess.  I imagine Terry Gilliam is a broken man now as this was his shot at greatness and he knows he'll never get a major directing job again.  Mirimax probably re-assigned his parking spot at the studio before this even went out to the theatres.      This despite all the beautiful stage-design and craftsmanship that is probably over-authentic, almost gothic/baroque, in the look and feel here. They spared no expense.    So the question:  what's wrong with this thing?    1) It has a lot of unexplained CGI magic which really took over the movie, but there isn't really an antagonist for the first 1+ hours, so the menace is not anchored and it looks like a pile of haunted-house nonsense.  I caught all the sinister music-cues and build-ups, but confusion and mystery are not the same thing.      Even when the plotline becomes clear later on the evil queen lacked personality and character as Monica Belucci, one of the world's great femme fatales, is poorly utilized. We can't enjoy her defeat when we weren't properly introduced to her at the beginning.     2) None of the dialog is clear.  Everyone is fooling around with silly accents which quickly became tiresome and the volume of the speech isn't even loud enough to follow the dialog.     3) The French, led by the great Jonathan Pryce, were a bunch of difficult, unfair jerks. Peter Stormare, the French inspector, was the Jar Jar Binks of this thing.  And it's never clear why they're jerks or what could be done to work against them or around them, so they were a continual annoying distraction away from the haunting/magic story.     4) Angelica, the love interest, was curt and not interested or interesting.  She seemed well on her way to a sad spinsterhood.  This was understandable as she'd supposedly lost her family, etc. Still, what little romance there was here felt contrived.  They needed someone both luminous and very likable, maybe Cameron Diaz, but instead they chose someone new who wasn't able to rise above the material.    There were also a couple of moments of real gore which felt very out of place in what was otherwise a light entertainment. So there was some lack of tone-control here as well.    On set I'm sure they got up every morning to try to make something smart and witty and fun, but putting whimsey on film is like catching lightning in a bottle - only the combined Pythons could ever accomplish this, and it become harder as people grow older and lose the spark and exhuberance of youth.  Terry Gilliam doesn't appear to have it anymore.  I hope he gets some new collaborators, otherwise this is the swansong of a great career.
B0007P3582|1.0|Just think about it for a second.....our heroes of today are guys that are proud to be shot 9 times....no wonder the world is so messed up these days.    - It amazes me how a fad such as breakdancing that is so positive, exhilarating, and inventive can only be in the media mainstream for less than 2 years (circa 1983-1985), but a fad such as being a gangster that ruins society is going on for like 15 years now! (NWA first introduced it in the late 80's).  It's sad to see that Hip Hop has turned into the very thing that it swore to diminish.    This is one fad that needs to come and go....quickly.
0689825498|5.0|We purchased this book for our 1-year-old daughter for Christmas, and she immediately fell in love with it.  Every time it is read to her (every day, several times a day), she eagerly lifts each flap to reveal the animal underneath.  Because of the rhythm and repetition of the story (we think), she also nods her head like a bobble-head doll as it is being read.  She doesn't do this with any of her other books!  We find the quality of the book to be superb as well.  Since Christmas, she's probably lifted the flaps a couple hundred times, seriously, and she does it with enthusiasm.  Surprisingly, the flaps are still in perfect shape, not torn or even bent.  I compared the thickness of the flaps to her other lift-the-flap books that quickly became worn and ripped (such as Peek-a-Moo!) and found that Dear Zoo's flaps are thicker, thus explaining its sturdiness.  You just can't go wrong with this book!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|To be honest with you, I checked this disk out purely because of my amazement at Madonna's staying power. I mean, how can a star be consistently successful and receive huge publicity on a regular basis? Here in China, we hear about her almost every day. Remembering some of her catchy signature songs like Holiday, Papa Don't Preach, La Isla Bonita, Like A Prayer, Take A Bow, and Music, I've decided to buy this super-hyped album. And, thank you Madonna! You entertain me so much with your Confessions On A Dance Floor. Hung Up will (if not already) become another classic tune of yours. Now, I know why you remain such a huge star after all these years. All hail the persistent queen.
B000002JEV|2.0|Seriously, is it just me or do Dazed and Confused, You Shook Me, the Whole Lotta Love medley and How Many More Times all go on to long? Face it, there's only so much you can do with a simple guitar/bass/drums/vocalist lineup. And not many rock bands can, in my mind, pull off ridiculously LONG songs all because they aren't half as good as the jazz musicians (who can do ridiculously LONG songs quite perfectly, by the way).<br /><br />Okay, so maybe the jams are too much. So why does this only warrent two stars? For one, none of the four versions of Communications Breakdown (or either take of I Can't Quit You Baby, for that matter) do much for me. I used to like Black Dog, until I heard the studio original and realized which one was better. And Stairway to Heaven is awful (this take, that is!) Plus expect note-for-note redos of What Is and What Should Never Be, Dazed And Confused (the more compact version, not the eighteen-minute freakout), You Shook Me (one of the finer tracks on Zep I), Thank You, Heartbreaker and Since I've Been Loving You, as well as a version of Immigrant without the double-tracked scream...why?<br /><br />However, there are a couple of interesting music here. Girl I Love, Traveling Riverside Blues (by far my favorite performance) and the wah-wah freakout Whole Lotta Love (Again, not the medley but a shorter take) all are interesting, and the cover's OK. Buy Cream's BBC Sessions disc instead, it's leagues better.
0060899190|5.0|Frank Warren's book PostSecret is a collection of postcards he has received in response to a project he was doing. He handed out  postcards (and left them at bookstores and other such places) and asked that people write down a secret they have but have never shared with anyone else and drop it into the mailbox anonymously. The collection in the book is amazing, they really do hit on every emotion from funny to sad. They make the reader feel more human in the sense that it makes you realize that people are more alike than we think and there are people out there that can relate to you. This is definitely a must read book! Everyone should own a copy. Kudos to Frank Warren on a terrific project.
B00006FM77|2.0|It is official; I'm tired of '60's-'70's marathon concerts. It's not the lengths of the songs themselves I mind, or even the fact that talented guitarists are stretching out a little, it's more that there's only so much you can do with just a guitar. Now, if you had a jazz ensemble (Check out Miles Davis' My Funny Valentine concert for a good example), or at least were a rock band that used more than a guitar for the solo veichiles, that would be different. Though Chicago was known for its horn section, rarely on the three endless cuts do they get any licks in. For instance, take all fifteen minutes of South California Purples. LP version? Great listening. But this? I can picture many better ways to spend my quarter-hour. Yeah, even listening to other songs. Same with In the Country, which never really impressed me much in the first place but here is just far too much. Ditto for Mean Tune. And half the second disc (not to mention most of disc three) is packed with mediocraty. (Mother, Lowdown, Flight 602, Motorboat to Mars, Free, I Don't Want Your Money, Happy 'Cause I'm Going home and an uninspired reading of Ballet for a Girl in Buchanan, if you must know). And why'd they need to \\"Introduce\\" Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? (or play Fancy Colors at all). In fact, I stopped listening after Disc 3 ended, and will probably never hear Disc Four.<br /><br />But there are a handful of decent tracks, such as Does Anybody Really Know, Questions 67 and 68, Beginnings, 25 or 6 to 4, I'm a Man and Song For Richard and His Friends. But overall, this is inessential and overindulgent.
B00005NNMK|5.0|This is easily Europe's best album.  Carrie was #1 in 26 countries and The Final Countdown soared to #1 on the Billboard 200 albums and the title track gave Europe another #1 single. More than a one-hit wonder and it's too bad that Europe's Prisoners in Paradise was overlooked and under-appreciated.  The Final Coundown produced four top 40 singles and Europe is easily one of the best bands from the 80s.  <br /> <br />The Final Countdown is their greatest and best album!! <br /> <br />Europe's Final Countdown is a classic!! <br /> <br />If you're looking for a one-hit wonder, try Faster Pussycat!!
B0000067L2|5.0|Only people who have seen 'The Breakfast Club' will probally understand the title of my review, or maybe not, who cares. But I can actually say that after that 1985 movie, I was listening a lot to classic rock stations, and came across this certain song I'm mocking at the beginning of my review, you guess it 'Sunshine of your Love'. Well I can say now that I know who Cream is, and I also know who Eric Clapton is, and he is God on this album, all the way thru it to, to be exact. I especially like 'Swlabr', don't quite understand what the title means, but a rockin' song. You also have another classic rock staple 'Strange Brew', good right there. You also have the more psychadellic sounding 'Dance the night away'. And I even like 'Outside Woman Blues', makes good sense. Anyways, this marked the beginning of me wearing the denim jacket, and becoming the misfit in highschool, well maybe not, but it makes a good story.
0679720200|4.0|With this first novel of his, Camus coined the theme of this book, into one, simple phrase: \\"The nakedness of man, faced with the absurd.\\" That man comes in the lead character of this tale, Monsier Mersault. He's an average, normal man, like any old average, normal looking guy off the street. He has a normal job. He looks normal. He has friends, some not so normal. He is in love with a girl who is a co-worker of his, Marie, who also shows affection back. They start dating, and soon can't help but want to get married, but that is mostly Maries want and decision, not Mersault's. He's overall fairly normal, but theres one possible exception. Mersault is an emotionless man. Even at the beginning of the book, where he is explaining his mothers death, he shows no sign of grievance or sadness. Even when faced with the big decision of marriage, and proposal, Mersault does not show any emotion or feelings at all toward it. He is not a man of morals or without morals; he is amoral. Life is pretty good for him, actually.    But when he gets involved with a senseless murder, he all together finds himself a completely different person, a stranger, in a strange, confusing world. You must read this book to truly understand the theme Camus meant to put out in this book, and succeeds soaringly at: \\"The nakedness of man, faced with the absurd.\\"
B000002KHB|5.0|I wonder to myself, if this album would have gotten this far without mentioning that, maybe. As the story goes about them getting their equipment burnt up at that Casino. Well at least it made one hell of a song 'Smoke on the water'. But I also have to say this whole album is good as well. I especially like 'Lazy', John Lord really plays a mean organ on it. You also have your roadtrip favorite 'Highway Star'. Ian Paice hammering the hell out of 'Pictures of Home'. Basically your standard rock and roll album of the 70's, but a few steps up from the norm. If you enjoy Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid', you'll find the similarities here too.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|I have never written an Amazon review before, but felt compelled to jump on and quickly warn Dune fans that the Extended Edition is garbage.  Many great moments were deleted, nearly all the add ins add nothing, and the replacement of Virginia Madsen with a male narrator really detracts.  The extended edition seems geared toward viewers who need everything spelled out for them six times.  It adds in scenes that Lynch originally cut because they were redundant and needelessly slowed down the action.     Edit: I forgot to mention that the Extended Edition has an utterly distracting soundtrack playing incessently under what seemed like every single scene.  It really made the movie seem melodramatic and hokey.  This, maybe more than anything else, made the EE impossible for me to enjoy.    After one viewing, I will not watch the Extended Edition again, and I am someone who sat through the only moderately good Sci-Fi mini-series more than once, because of how much I like Dune.    I still give the DVD 3 stars for the nice rendition of the original and some decent extras.  Just don't, as I did, get your hopes too high for a longer version of the same great movie.  It ain't here.    Long live the fighters! (which, incidentally, is another line botched by a needless, lengthy interruption in the extended edition)
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|I went to see this film when it first came out and I was syked since I love the video game.  I was wanting to be scared to death but that didn't happen.  I didn't even get a shiver.  The film is done as a action film, not a thriller so don't expect to piss your pants in fear.  The action scenes are decent and the gore level is up there...some of the CGI is a little corny but Jovovich is enough to make you forgive the defects of the film.  It's fun and entertaining while not living up to the hype I placed on it.  I give it four stars because for what it is, an action film with a beautiful star, it pulls through.  It just doesn't have the same feel the video game has...it doesn't do the game justice in that respect.  But if you want to see a bunch of people shooting zombies and rabbid dogs then this is for you.
0618526412|5.0|I have read this book many times through the years, and it is one of my absolute favourites!!I still cant believe that Carson McCullers was only 23 when she wrote the book- incredible! This book has great characters and a story line I love it!
1572814136|5.0|I've owned about 3 Rider-Waite decks and more than a few Rider-Waite clones and this one is the best that I have come across. The colors are clear and bold, but not garish. With the other decks, the colors were either too soft as in the Universal Waite or just so ugly and flat like in the Original Rider that I would look at them and never really \\"see\\" them. There was just no connection for me there. <br /> <br /> That is, until the Radiant. These cards are much clearer and more vibrant than the others. The drawing themselves are the same (mostly?), but the colors make them look like an entirely different deck. They called my attention to details that I had only barely noticed before and in most cases not at all. Instead of the sun behind the angel in Temperance, there is a crown. This adds an aspect of the divine to the path, as if saying that the way to Divinity is through balance. The 9 of Wands is another great one. You can see the trepidation and fear, or depending on how you look at it, the \\"bring it\\" look on his face. The hand in the Ace of Pentacles looks much more human in this version, echoing that its we humans that deal with money and not ghostly, otherworldly figures.  <br /> <br />In short, I love this deck. And if you have always liked the Rider-Waite drawings but the colors weren't working for you, then give it a try and you might love it too! <br /> <br />Bright Blessings. <br />

B0006GAOBI|5.0|i wasnt expecting much from this movie at all. my girlfriend picked it up one night and we checked it out. we were blown away. this is seriously original, smart, and entertaining. i definatly recommend everyone at least give this movie a shot. great flick!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Based on the stage play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols' \\"Closer\\" is a generally uncompromising look at that great big messy thing we call love.  The movie views romance as a kind of high stakes parlor game in which men and women jockey for positions of power, use sex and deception as weapons to annihilate their opponents or get what they want, and wind up settling for safety over passion when it's time to get on with their lives.  \\"Closer\\" also acknowledges the sad truth that, when it comes to love, we tend to want what we do not have, then lose interest once the desired object is attained.<br /><br />Marber has written a complex screenplay centered around four major characters.  Dan is an unsuccessful novelist who meets and falls in love with Alice, a young American living in London.  Julia Roberts plays a professional photographer named Anna, another American transplant, who has her first encounter with Dan when he comes to her studio to have some portraits taken of him.  A mutual attraction develops between the two of them despite Dan's purported love for Alice.  The fourth main character is a doctor named Larry who meets Anna and falls in love with her even though Anna's real obsession seems to be Dan.<br /><br />For the next couple of years, the relationships between these four characters undergo tremendous transformations, forming and re-forming, grouping and re-grouping, until even the individuals involved no longer know what they feel or who they want.  All they know is that happiness always seems to be vaguely out of reach because the person each of them is involved with has either moved on to someone else or has lost interest in the relationship.  The film often condenses time by leapfrogging over months and years between major scenes without a great deal of transition, forcing us to pay rapt attention at all points throughout the movie.<br /><br />Since \\"Closer\\" is derived from a stage play, it's not always successful at hiding its theatrical roots.  Sometimes that's a good thing as when the movie achieves a sealed-off, claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the personal drama.  Like a lot of stage writing, the dialogue is often literate, sharp and insightful, but, towards the end, it occasionally feels a bit too clever and artificial for its own good.  Once the characters start articulating the \\"great truths\\" of their lives, they lose authenticity and become mouthpieces for the author.  And after about an hour of watching them sabotage their own happiness and listening to them whine about their lives, your patience and empathy may begin to run a bit thin, undercutting some of the positive feelings you've developed towards the movie in the first half.<br /><br />In terms of the acting, three of the four leads - Law, Roberts and Natalie Portman - all deliver strong, subtle performances, but Clive Owen hits too many false notes, especially when he is called upon to emote to any great extent.  Still, the others draw us into their insulated little world of drama and woe just enough to make us interested in what's taking place in their lives and damn thankful we aren't a part of it.<br /><br />If for nothing else, \\"Closer\\" deserves plaudits for a clever, dead-on, hilarious and brilliantly sustained comic sequence involving internet cyber sex.  That alone is worth the price of a rental.ng its theatrical roots.  Sometimes that's a good thing as when the movie achieves a sealed-off, claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the personal drama.

B0009A1AS2|3.0|I was really disappointed with this CD. I got it for xmas and was really looking forward to it since I liked Train of Thought so much. But after 5 or 6 listens, I just can't in all honesty say this is a good CD. <br /> <br />It sounds to me like the band was going thru the motions of putting out a CD. I don't hear many interesting musical ideas. Some vocals and melodies seem forced and lack orginality... I even hear a few melody lines from past Dream Theater CDs. <br /> <br />I will give it a few more listens because I really want to like this CD... my ToT and Scenes CD's are wearing out from use. <br /> <br />If you like ballady 80's rock, then give this a listen, else I'd recommend waiting for the next release.
0380789035|4.0|This is my third Gaiman book, and it's the best I've read so far. The entire concept of the book is wonderfully imaginative in itself, and a bit strange which is a big reason that I like it. Gaiman's writing style is relaxed and engrossing making the book very hard to put down. The characters are interesting and deep...I think the reluctant hero has been taken to a new level with Shadow! The plot twists were well constructed, or at least hidden well enough to fool me (I'm not very good at spotting twists in books).<br /><br />My only knocks on the book were that the ending very brief and simple for all of the build up of the book. In thinking back, maybe this was done intentionally by Gaiman as a point in itself; perhaps that we live in a very transitional society where the payoff usually isn't worth the buildup? Anyway, I could have used a bit more here. Also, I know that there was a lot of symbolism in the book; I could feel it there, just beneath the surface. Unfortuantely, much of it was lost on me. I found myself wishing I had a book about world mythology next to me so that I could figure out who some of the gods were and what some of the symbols represented.<br /><br />If you like Gaiman and imaginative books, I would highly recommend this book. Just make sure you have some free time...it tends to suck you in. :)
0307276902|1.0|Terribly disappointed about all the lies in this book. More disappointing is the fact that not many people are bothered about the lying and fiction in a supposedly non-fiction book. This book has no redeeming value nor any lessons to be learnt.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I admit to being a Kong fanatic and I love anything to do with the big hairy ape, so I just had to go and see Peter Jackson's version. It was such an emotional experience I was in tears by the end of it. It was just so well constructed and realized so perfectly you can't help but get swept away in the grand spectacle. <br /> <br />Me, I always complain that movies are too short, I was pleasantly surprised at how long Kong was. It's rare you get a big blockbuster that takes time to develop its characters and focuses on the background as well as on the action scenes too. This film does it wonderfully, and though the pace may lag at times and one or two of the dinosaurs look a little funky, it's Kong and Ann's relationship that makes it so good to watch. <br /> <br />King Kong is realized perhaps in the best way this time round, as a proper animal that you can actually believe in. The '33 kong had some good FX work but it looks a little dated now, and the '76 Kong had some really dodgy suit work, but with this film you get a real physcial animal. The amount of subtlety and depth in Kong's performance is amazing as he and Ann journey through skull island and new york so you really feel for him when he falls from the Empire State Building, much like the original, this is one of the few films that ever made me cry. Peter Jackson has taken the wonder and magic of that first movie and just supercharged it, creating something incredible. <br /> <br />I hope that there's an extended version of this, a few scenes were actually cut out. Bring on the ten hour movies, that's what i say.  <br /> <br />Seriously though, if you're looking for a real epic experience, a movie that is above the rest, Kong is still the king.
0440241588|4.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed this book - at least until the last page.  Grisham took a lobbiest who had gotten in over his head and begged for protective custody in prison a pardon arranged by the CIA, the dupe for a president granted the pardon.  The CIA planted him in a city, and after then the CIA planted his location to any number of spy agencies that may want to kill him. <br /> <br />I love the detail that Grisham brought to the city of Bologna.  I makes me want to visit the city.  The detail brought it alive.  There is a love interest, but it is restrained, and not seedy.  There is an old American Communist who dreams of the old days.  The entire book had me turning the page wondering what was going to happen next and who was going to get him and how. <br /> <br />However, I was utterly disappointed by the end.  I expect closure in Grisham (or any other one-off book).  I didn't get that sense of completion when I finished the final page, and in that respect, I feel a little cheated.  I invested three days in the book and I have no conclusion.  That is why the book didn't get a five. <br /> <br />Still, an enjoyable yarn.  Be sure you have time on your hands before you start because this is a hard one to put down.
B00005V331|5.0|I dont even know where to start with this review. Venom, is one of the most influencial bands to the Black Metal and Metal community. Some say bands like Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath were the birth of heavy metal, and even though those bands are a piece of rock and roll history, Venom doesn't get enough credit. Even though Black Metal is still pretty much underground in the US today (it is much more popular overseas)Venom should get ALOT more credit for coming out with such a poweful Metal album, not to mention the fact the FIRST Black Metal album. Remember that there wasn't anything like it in 1980 (even though CDNOW claims it was first released in 1985, this is incorrect, it was released in 1981, and recorded in 1980)and it would be three years before Slayer, Metallica, and Exodus would contribute to the Metal World. What is even more suprising is how the album has stood up to the test of time. Yes, the recording sounds horrid, yet is wasn't exactly recorded in the best of studios, and I am sure it was done on a shoestring budget. This is an Album that every Metal fan should have, as they will have another piece of history to extreme music. What I like even better is that David Grohl (Foo Fighters) got together with Cronus for a song of Grohl's side project, Probot. This proves that Venom has influenced not only Black Metal bands, but rock bands as well. Venom deserved to be elected into the rock and roll hall of fame just for the sake of creating a new genere of music. ENJOY
B00005JMYI|5.0|Will Ferrel is the man!  The role of Ron Burgundy suited him well.  And he capitalisized box-office-wise to great effect by assuming this 'anchorman of anchormen' lead.  Two Thumbs Up!  Way Up!  Hadn't laughed this hard since Tanya Harding used her Kerrigan knee-capper in a 'Colder Than Ice Cold' failed attempt at smut.  Christina Applegate did a fine job.  No, that's selling her short - she was titillatingly splendid.  Steve Carell's IQ may have escaped him in this flick, but it barely showed....oh alright, even the polar bear club would have demanded photo ID plus background check.  Very funny movie!  Ferrel drunk at the bar doing his best Ted Kasinsky drowning in a cesspool of his own frustration was a hoot.  Thanks to all involved with the film, for I can now in good faith point to my 'Pattern in the Pleats' as explanation for all misgivings/shortcomings.   <br /> <br />A quick word on what it takes to emulate Ronald Burgundy's lavish workplace know-how:    <br /> <br />If one owns many leather bound books, a next logical step would be 'Become local television news host/anchor.'  That's all it takes folks.  Books bounded by sweet/sweat scented leather - questionably recycled hooker boots and bum chaps shall not count on account of the smell-factor which cannot be discarded duefully nor outrightly - are your ticket to a rusted tinsle town.  Yes, at this stage you can earnestly make claim of possessing 'The Right Stuff' 'The Mack Skills' 'The Dim Wits of Reporter Tradition'.  Albeit critical acclaim/acknowledgement along the fine-lines of 'Big phony lacking belly laugh believability' and 'Such a Dullard the viewing audience can't help but contemplate belly laughing' is yet far off.  Needn't fret!  Those goods will come with the baggage - the hag seated next to you learned this lesson decades earlier dating your arrival when her rocky on-scene update covering the local brothel revealed an all too familiar name in the scandalous brouhaha's late 60's archives (here'sinserted name of whomever your local coanchor happens to be - sexual status irrelevant).  And you thought their constant brooding on set week-in-week-out was senility in practice!  You see, Ron Burgundy took his notes on the fly, but from birth he surpassed you and I.  His books were leather bound.  Are yours?  Shouldn't they be?  Will you ever initiate jotting down post-birth guiding notes?  We can't all be Ron Burgundy at the anchor chair, but the sooner the better, trust me.  Paperback wasn't invented in his day - then again the cover's consistency didn't seem to hinder Ron's competency level one iota.  'Go Frick Yourselves San Diego' is prime evidence of just that.  C'mon future anchor persons, if you're gonna be so brash as to convince yourself of the futility of preparatory prime time area news greetings & salutations, well, please 'Go Frick Yourselves.'  I don't want my progeny staring bleary-eyed numbskullish at your drivel spewing robotically programmed remote controlled psychobabble frequented freakishly lip sticked yapper (is that lip stick I spot on two front yellow speckled teeth/mischisled dentures?) - especially when the little diablos could at the snap of my butler's fingers swiftly switch the channel and tune in to Ronny Boy Burgundy! - or the likes of his ilk.  I want my seed edumacated, NOT mentally emaciated via verbally lackluster 'And here's the news good people' fantasmagorical shoot-yourself-in-both-feet-put-yourself-in-a-stranglehold-pinch-your-brain-borefests!  Why can't you lie to me straightfaced?  Everybody else does.  Getting away with it isn't a grand challenge.  Ron Burgundy should serve as your prima donna anchor (man over board) archetype - follow not your heart but Ronald 'big lights' Burgundy in all sincere endeavor.  Fare thee well, he's a tough act to follow come suppertime story.  My notes are full.   <br />In the case this has drawn laughs from anyone...I've a quick rap (condensed rendition)to lay down as a creme de le cremesnack-on extra.

B00005K9LK|4.0|So you want to know more about Priest music? You should get this album, then! <br />The fact is that Screaming for Vengeance is one of their better efforts overall, also accessible without losing its metallic edge. Once you listen to the gorgeous riff from \\"The Hellion\\" you will know you have a winner. It is quickly followed by its inseparable companion track \\"Electric Eye\\", Priest's ultimate concert opener. A loud, bombastic track with crazy fast riffs and solos. \\"Riding on the Wind\\" is even better. Its great drumming begins the track in strong fashion and we can enjoy more guitar wizardry from KK and Glenn. Oh, and those are some nifty special effects, misters. \\"Bloodstone\\" is another masterpiece of ingenious songwriting. The intro, the lead breaks, vocals - it is a gem.  <br />\\"(Take These) Chains\\" now slows things down a little, but it is still enjoyable. I just can't say the same for \\"Pain and Pleasure\\". This rocker sounds like those tracks from Point of Entry I don't care much about. The chorus is quite catchy and its lyrics are hard to forget. Maybe for the wrong reasons. You can probably guess by its title... <br />The title track is great! Now, between us, I would be lying if I told you that the vocals are not a bit of an annoyance this time, but I _can_ live with that. Halford could do it back then so why shouldn't he, right?...Maybe?...Anyway, now we have \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\". Catchy hooks, short but tight solo, vintage sing-along metal. Fresh and spontaneous. No wonder it was a huge hit, it is goddam catchy. <br />\\"Fever\\" builds an emotional intensity that culminates in a metallic chorus. It works because it does not rely on saccharine music to get its message through. Priest tried to do some strong ballads similar to this one later (\\"Night Comes Down\\", anyone?), but the results were not as satisfying. \\"Devil's Child\\" has a riffage that reminds me of AC/DC. I like it, just don't go crazy about it, while many love it. <br />This album is excellent and anyone with some interest in heavy metal music should listen to it. <br />* Bonus time. \\"Prisoner Of Your Eyes\\" is...not that impressive, but it is nice for a bonus track. There is also another live track (\\"Devil's Child\\") I don't care about - at least we can have live redemptions of some more overlooked songs, okay?
B000AADYYO|3.0|\\"We feel our music does not fit any one particular label.\\" This is an all too common statement made my too many bands, none of which does that phrase even remotely apply. However, of all the bands I have heard, Opeth is one that truly incorporates and borrows from various genres outside of metal to form a sound which is uniquely their own. Make no mistake about it, Opeth is metal through-and-through. But, they manage successfully blend elements of various musical styles such as jazz fusion, classical, and progressive rock in a manner which works on their albums.     \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is an album with which I was both amazed and slightly disappointed. Granted, I am fairly new to Opeth's music, and my initial fascination with the band was spawned by the video for \\"The Grand Conjuration.\\" So by no means am I thoroughly familiar with their earlier work. However, I have listened to \\"Ghost Reveries\\" enough to where I feel I can write an honest critique of the album. First, the strengths:    1) With \\"Ghost Reveries\\" Opeth displays their immense song-writing creativity and intrepid proficiency to venture into other genres of music to create a truly unique album. In short, Mikael Akerfeldt is a genius (though unfortunately, his talents will likely never be recognized outside of the metal community which exists largely underground). Each individual song is a distinct and separate entity from the other songs on the album. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is not an album where the listener will feel like every song sounds the same. Each song is distinct, not only in its arrangement, but its musical style/genre as well. For example, there are songs on the album (e.g., \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Hours of Wealth\\") which contain no elements of metal...whatsoever! As a matter of fact, on the latter track Akerfeldt performs a clean acappella vocal arrangement throughout parts of the song, which manages to showcase his versatility as a vocalist. Then there are songs which primarily consist of a death metal style (minus the blast beats and including some clean vocals), \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" and \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" being prime examples.    2) \\"Ghost Reveries\\" contains something for most every fan of music. Even individuals who are turned off by metal will find songs and elements of songs that they will probably enjoy. Here again, this is credited to Opeth being brave enough to venture outside the walls of metal when writing their music. However, metal fans will find enough in the album to satiate their appetite for all things heavy.    3) The album showcases the overwhelming talents of all the band members. Akerfeldt has a vocal range unlike any singer I have ever heard. His death growls are brutal to the point that he literally sounds possessed! Yet he has the ability to sing clean vocals in a manner which could only be described as \\"beautiful.\\" The listener will be awestruck by the diversity of both the vocals and songs on the album. After listening to \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" and \\"Hours of Wealth,\\" one will probably say \\"I can't believe the same band wrote both of these songs!\\" The styles are that different! In addition to Akerfeldt's talents, he is surrounded by a supporting cast which is equally as proficient on their respective instruments.     As mentioned earlier, I do have criticisms of \\"Ghost Reveries\\" as well:     1) Perhaps the most noticeable complaint I have with \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is the length of the songs on the album. Many of the songs surpass the 9 minute mark, with one (I believe) exceeding 10 minutes. Though this is Opeth's style, as many of their albums contain lengthy songs, I find this to be tedious. For example, the introduction portion of \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" falls just shy of 2 minutes, during which it manages to be highly repetitive and somewhat boring. Though I love this song (it is my favorite on the album), I am left with the feeling of \\"ok guys, I get it, can we move on now?\\" However, I want to reiterate, lengthy song writing is Opeth's style, and I'm confident that fans of the band are accustomed to this and probably enjoy it. However, to those who are not familiar with the band, and tend to get bored with lengthy songs...be warned.     2) A second complaint that I have is the quality of the songs on \\"Ghost Reveries.\\" I want to be clear that there are no fillers on this album...none. Every song is brilliant in its arrangement. However, some of the songs are more enjoyable to listen to, whereas, others do not suit my taste. Here again, this is due to Opeth's inclusion of a diversity of musical genres in their song writing. Such diversity can be a double-edged sword. On one side, the band displays an openness of mind that is to be commended and makes an album which contains the potential to appeal to a variety of people. On the other side, the band makes an album which contains songs some listeners will listen to repeatedly and others the listener will dislike(depending on taste).    Overall, I feel that any fan of metal should give \\"Ghost Reveries\\" a chance. If nothing else, it will open one's mind to the fact that death metal can extend to a region beyond blast beats, constant distortion in guitars, and death growls (not that there is anything wrong with any of this) without being labeled a \\"sell out.\\" Opeth is truly a metal band unlike any other you will ever hear!

B0000012YO|5.0|Niemals und durch kein anderer Pianist habe Ich eine bessere Ausf&uuml;hrung der \\"Neuen Testament der Klaviermusik\\" (= alle 32 von Beethoven geschrieben Pianosonaten) geh&ouml;rt.<br /><br />Ebenso prima sch&ouml;nes Spiel habe Ich nur von einigen Sonaten auch geh&ouml;rt von Svjatoslav Richter, mit wem Gilels im Moskauer Konservatorium studiert hat unter der grosse Heinrich Neuhaus.<br /><br />Kenner wissen dass Richter eher \\"legato\\", Gilels mehr \\"assai\\" belieben. Aber die beide Titaner weissen sehr gut wann WIE ein St&uuml;ck gespielt werden muss. Beispiel: Beim ber&uuml;hmte Mondschein-Sonate h&ouml;ren Sie auf diesem CD kein \\"assai\\" wenn Gilels uns das durch keinen anderen besseres gespielte Adagio gibt, ebenso kein legato (ruhiger, 'lyrischer') h&ouml;ren lasst wenn man nach das immer f&uuml;r erfahrenen Pianisten sehr schwierige \\"Appassionata\\" (Sonate 23 f-moll, op. 57) anfangt mit das fantastische \\"Allegro assai\\".<br /><br />Zehn Jahre hat Emil Gilels (Sp&auml;tsommer 1985 gestorben) gearbeitet an die volle 9 CD's (Teil I und II) und das lasst sich h&ouml;ren. Der Titan mit seinem Repertorium von Bach bis Strawinsky hat hier das allerbeste musiziert das Ich in meinem Leben spielen h&ouml;ren habe von Beethovens Klaviersonaten. Diese T&ouml;ne sind himmlisch: intellektuell, k&uuml;nstlerisch, Sonderklasse.<br /><br />WICHTIG ! (f&uuml;r nicht-Spezialisten): Gilels (auch Richter, Arrau, Cortot, Horowitz: Sie sind ungef&auml;hr 12 Persone zusammen...) ist einer der grossen \\"LISZTIANER\\" die es sich in die Geschichte gegeben hat. Das heisst es sind (zusammen vielleicht auch mit Evgeny Kissin) DIE BESTEN PIANISTEN IMMER. \\"LISZTIANER\\" k&ouml;nnten noch spielen \\"mit die KLASSE von Liszt\\": NIEMALS HAT'S ER DE FACTO BESSER PIANO GESPIELT ALS FRANZ LISZT, der grosse Komponist selbe (wissen wir zum Beispeil von Hoffmann und Cortot die ob \\"Der Meister\\" noch gekennt haben weder &uuml;ber ihm aus erster Brunne erz&auml;hlen gehabt haben... Aber ... alle Lisztianer sind seit die '90-er Jahre verstorben...LEIDER !!!
B00082IJ08|4.0|Sure, these guys are talented and I would like to see more albums from them, but I came inches away from buying this album, but then listened to the preview and found I only liked \\"feel good\\" and \\"november..\\" so I bought those 2 songs as singles.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Let's face it, with so much hype and emptiness found in most popular music it seems that image is everything; you might as well not put the darn disc in the jacket since the cover and name is what sells most albums. This, however, is GREAT music pure and simple. John Mayer is an absolutely fabulous song-writer, and now that he has formally pushed his way through the gap into the blues genre I am happy to discover a whole new generation of young people getting turned on to REAL music once more. It seems things are slowly starting to come full cirlce again. Up until the mid-80's most popular music was great music because it was about the songs and message, not the money. I hope that this album and others like it may start a trend in which new listeners will be demanding substance once more and not hype. Kudos to Mayer for a terrific album.
B00005JOFO|4.0|This is a wonderful film, with only a single major flaw. The direction is really remarkable -- Ang Lee should be given the Oscar now, why waste time? His direction make's Heath Ledger's rather stoic performance almost magical, and gives Jake G.'s histrionics the right tone. Particularly unique is the scene with Jack's parents at the end of the movie. Really amazing. <br /> <br />But -- and for me it was a big but, the movie sounds one strident and false note, and I assume the fault comes from the novel. (Plot giveaway coming...) The film leaves virtually no stone unturned in making it clear to us that gays are victims of a brutal and uncaring society. In case we weren't getting the message, we are shown the dead rancher with his genitals ripped off. That's fine -- it's a formative trauma for Ennis. The two star-crossed lovers struggle with their love in an immensely moving story. I was completely drawn in, 100% sold, empathizing, sympathizing, emoting. <br /> <br />Then, we are treated to the flash of Jack getting his head bashed in. Literally getting beaten over the head with the hate crime message that this movie had already given us in no uncertain terms. So, we have a tender, beautiful and subtle film filled with moving performances, astonishing direction, exquisite photography and understated elegance turned, in one five-second clip, into a PC gays-as-victims \\"hate crime\\" agenda film replete with head-bashing. <br /> <br />Is it possible that anyone who would go see this movie did not get the message before that clip? Would the movie have been any less moving if Jack had committed suicide, or self-destructed some other way? Or even just sailed off into the sunset in his false and empty life, leaving Ennis? <br /> <br />This story, and this movie, would have had so much more artistic value without slipping into the whole hate crime mode. Is there really a single sane person in this country who condones murdering someone for their sexual orientation? Do we thinkthe police or FBI do not investigate such crimes equally with other murders? Do we need to be convinced on this issue -- that murder is bad, whatever the reason? Of the 16,000 murders in the US in 2003, perhaps 6 could have been classified as anti-male gay hate crimes. Is that an epidemic that needs to be staunched with a major Hollywood film? Did \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" stop the epidemic of murders of transgender women in Texas? <br /> <br />So now, we ask, why would someone kill a man just because he was gay? A reasonable answer would be from a severe emotional dysfunction or instability which made the person fear homosexuality. A crime of emotion and fear. Sort of like shooting your wife for cheating, or drowning your kids because you can't provide for them... My point is ALL these crimes are equally bad, but this movie had a much more important message to send. The beautifully-depicted love between these two conflicted men let us see the reality of a gay relationship in a way no film has before. We even saw the unconditional love of a mother, and a father who refused to allow his son's sexuality to define his life or his death. The writers did not need to bash Jake G's head in to get the message across. Too bad. <br /> <br />I wonder if you are allowed to criticize this film?
B000000993|5.0|With all of the clone bands that exist in the modern rock scene these days, it becomes very easy to simply get bored and dismiss everything. However it is critical that we recognize the albums that were true landmarks. \\"Undertow\\" clearly was. Not only was the sound and style that Tool created new for its time, it also sounded fantastic. Their power was intense and the subject matter was actually disturbing while also being intellectually stimulating. This is a point where so many of the second-rate Tool clones failed.. their disturbance seems forced and the lyrics are just a snore. Tool also did a lot to rekindle many people's interest in music videos which had been growing increasingly dull over time. <br /> <br />In short, I know that modern rock has become incredibly tiresome and generic but don't make the mistake of overlooking a truly epic album such as \\"Undertow\\".
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|For the fans of Titanic this is a good DVD with everything you always wanted to see.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|When Joss Whedon's Firefly aired on Fox in 2002 it was at a time in my life where work dominated everything and TV was a distant thought.  It wasn't until Christmas 2005 that a friend of mine told me about the series when I mentioned that I was interested in buying the DVD of the movie Serenity, that unfortunately had a theatrical run in the last month of my wife's pregnancy and 2 hours at the theatre was not the best use of my time.  At the time of Serenity's release I had no idea the series and movie were connected, and had it not been for my friend's suggestion I would have bought the DVD of Serenity and been left completely confused. <br /> <br />Anyone considering watching Serenity should take the time and buy Firefly: The Complete Series here on Amazon (best $40 you'll spend on entertainment).  Think of the series DVDs as a 14 part prequel to Serenity, a chance to dip your toe in the vast 'verse Joss Whedon created and the backstory of some of the complex characters that call Serenity home.  Serenity begins shortly after the end of the series and while at first the interaction between some of the crew, Mel in particular, seem harsh and uncharacteristic (especially after watching the series) you begin to understand that the untold story between the series and the movie took a terrible toll on the crew of Serenity.  This story is told without any regard to someone who's never seen the original TV series so I again highly recommend buying the Firefly series before embarking on Serenity's feature voyage. <br /> <br />As a newcomer to this 'verse I feel sad to know that the 14 episodes+1 movie that were some of the best storytelling and cinematography to ever grace the small or big screen might never have another chance on either venues.  The camera work in Firefly/Serenity remind me of the revisioned Battlestar Galactica series on the Sci-Fi network (the series is most likely where Ronald Moore and Co. got their 'documentary' ideas from) and really help put you into the story.  The movie is shot in such a way that you're drawn in, instead of the cold staged shots typical of big productions, Serenity is more organic which brings a sense of realism to the characters and their plight. <br /> <br />Everyone who is a fan of sci-fi will love this movie and the Firefly series, but the real gem in Joss' storytelling is anyone, no matter what genre appeals to them, can find themselves at home aboard Serenity.
0634060384|5.0|The old illegal Real Book was fantastic, except, of course, for the fact that it was illegal.  Many young jazz musicians (and probably some not-so-young) learned how to play the jazz classics from this book. . .  and the book itself probably played a role in which tunes became classics in the first place. <br /> <br />I have generally not been a fan of Hal Leonard's fake books, but I must say I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened up their revision of the Real Book.  The notation appears to be computer-printed, but using a nice handwritten-style font, but much of the text and the chord symbols seem to be truly handwritten (perhaps by the same person who wrote them in the illegal book). <br /> <br />This revision is missing some of the tunes from the old Real Book, such as anything written by Dave Holland or Dave Brubeck, and Pat Metheny's exercises from the end of the book.  It is also missing pointers to albums where you can hear the tunes, which I always thought was a nice touch in the old Real Book. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Hal Leonard has done a very good job here, and I fully expect that their new legal Real Book series will largely supplant the old Real Book in many venues, especially jazz education.
0790729628|3.0|Perhaps I am ignorant of the sci-fi world, but I fail to see how one could state that this is the all-time best \\"sci-fi\\" film of all time, especially when, approximately 10 years after Blade Runner was made, there was a far more compelling movie made, \\"Back to the Future,\\" which has generated a much larger fan base as well.<br /><br />The book, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\\" was far better than Blade Runner.  It's hard to imagine that Phillip Dick would have approved of such a poor rendition of his masterpiece.<br /><br />One thing bears noting, though:  one of the key film locations in this movie, Ennis House, is one of the most endangered properties in the world.  It literally is facing the risk of extinction, and I do hope that the fans of Blade Runner, along with the cast and crew, will do something to save it.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" is, hands down, the best album of 2004.  \\"Funeral\\" is a moving album about lost love, loneliness, and death. Win Butler throws ten wonderful tracks, none of which I dislike. <br /> <br />Crown of Love: A song about about a man that can't stop thinking about his lover, so to ease his pain; he commits suicide. Amazing track, probably my personal favorite. <br /> <br />Haiti: A song about a man with no one left so he joins the army, he's sent to kill the residents of a small town but he cannot go through with doing so; so he runs away from the army and is shot down by his own men. Short track, but still amazing. Most of it's in French. <br /> <br />In The Backseat: A song about a young woman that has 'been asleep' her whole life, and after a near-death accident (automobile crash) she 'wakes up'. Wonderful song. <br /> <br />Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels): A pretty straight forward track about husband and wife who are very lonely in a snowed-in village. One of my favorite tracks on the album. <br /> <br />Neighborhood #2 (Laika): A pretty confusing song about a kid named \\"Alexander\\" whom the government are testing something on for the good and safety of the world (it's for your own good, it's for the neighborhood). An amazing track, wonderful! <br /> <br />Neighborhood #3 (Power Out): A song about an ice-storm in Montreal, but if you really pay attention, it's much deeper then that. I think it's about the passion for life that seems to fade away as you get older. Great track. <br /> <br />Neighborhood #4 (Kettles): A song about a man that can't stop thinking about the death of a loved one, but he knows that if he could stop thinking about it, it'll pass quickly. No matter what he does, nothing seems to change. Amazing. <br /> <br />Rebellion (Lies): An amazing track about people who aren't truly living. That spend their time hiding from the greater things in life. <br /> <br />Une Anne Sans Lumiere: A very powerful song about someone who's tryingto hide their haunted past to their lover. A very short, but still very powerful song. <br /> <br />Wake Up: An incredible track about the pain of growing up unprepared, about not wanting to grow up. Incredible song, incredible band, incredible album. <br /> <br />All of these are just my interpretations of each track.
B00005K9LK|5.0|why do record companies have to hard limit and increase volume on cds to make them sound louder.all your doing is destroying the sound.tinny highs,flat bass.dont get me wrong i love this album but im sick of epic and sony destroying sound.i guess they like distorsion and no dynamic range.for the album i give it 5 stars.for sound quality i give it zero.time to get back into vinyl.crisp highs and deep warm bass.
0393061310|5.0|Why did Spain conquer the great empires of the new world rather than the other way around? For Jared Diamond, there's no mystery, no explanations rooted in great men or in social institutions. It comes down to luck of the draw.  Eurasia contained the world's greatest land mass--and its most abundant stock of domesticatable animals and plants. These animals and plants gave Eurasia an eight thousand year lead--a lead that could cope with any number of great men and social institutions.<br /><br />Guns, Germs, and Steel takes an intermediate position between works of physical anthropology and history. Most attempts at world history deal with the period starting with the establishment of farming in the fertile crescent and Egypt (with a chapter each on China and the new world). Diamond wonders about the period leading up to farming--and examines how the discovery of farming and animal husbandry might have spread in Eurasia (where the east-west axis allowed plants and animals to move along similar climate zones) and in Africa and the Americas where the north-south orientation slowed transmission.<br /><br />Diamond doesn't answer all of the questions.  Why, for example, if the Polynesians could travel thousands of miles to establish colonies in Easter Island and in Hawaii, couldn't the Meso-Americans have gotten in boats and travelled to the civilization of the Andes. Surely a north-south access isn't quite sufficient to explain this lack. But overall, it's hard to argue with Diamond's thesis.
B0000060LT|5.0|On this album, the Dirty Three showcase their most somber instrumental talents. Here, their music whispers across musical landscapes, somehow expressing more emotion than spoken words ever could. The music on \\"Ocean Songs\\" seems borne of a woolly, restless intoxication. It is a underlain with a meandering sadness and spilling over beautiful, dulcid atmospheres.     Beginning with the most forward and ethereal melody on the entire album, the wispy song \\"Sirena\\" is easily one of the saddest pieces. Followed by \\"The Restless Waves\\" and \\"Distant Shore,\\" all uniquely beautiful, vibrant, the first three songs are somehow tied together in their echoes of romance and despair.    The music lives and breathes, and you become willingly captive, especially on the album's longer pieces, the sentimental \\"Deep Waters\\" and the ecstatic \\"Authentic Celestial Music.\\" These songs, although rather indulgent, gain in emotional momentum right up to their end. \\"Ends of the Earth\\" calms the cumulative effect of the album with the beautiful addition of piano. The album, as a whole, is simply ethereal. It is a primal emotional energy that has been temporarily captured, but not tamed.     Truly this is the saddest and most epic material recorded by the remarkable three-piece band. The slow, casual guitars and jumbled drums might merely fill interesting space were it not for Warren's love for the expressiveness of violin. What might otherwise have been noteworthy background music pulls you in, and slowly rolls you around in the murk, sometimes sad and screaming, other times calm and brooding.    Key Songs: \\"Sirena,\\" \\"The Restless Waves,\\" \\"Authentic Celestial Music,\\" \\"Deep Waters\\"
B000000OAA|4.0|Sheer Heart Attack is Queen's third album. Although not all the songs are good, it is one of the best. This is their first real popular album, including the hit Killer Queen, this album was a real success. It starts with the great opener Brighton Rock, this song is very good, a shame that the guitar solo is too long. Killer Queen, their first big hit is a great song too, nothing special to say. Tenement Funster is a good Taylor-written song which is one of the best of the album. Flick Of The Wrist is a fast rocker, certainly one of my favorites, and Lily Of The Valley is a short but good one. Now I'm Here is the best song of the album.<br /><br />After these six jewels we unfortunately arrive to the weaker side of the album. In The Lap Of The Gods is nice, but it's kinda boring. Stone Cold Crazy is very cool, with the fast stanza's and the cool voices in the chorus. Dear Friends is a ballad written by May, and it contains good lyrics, but I don't like it that much. Misfire is one of the weaker songs together with Bring Back That Leroy Brown, the last is so happy 'n' boring that I ALWAYS skip it. She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilletoes) is the dullest and most boring song in the entire Queen-existance. Fortunately the final song In The Lap Of The Gods.........Revisited is one of the best songs of Queen.<br /><br />I've let you know my opinion and I hope it'll help you with your choice, if you need a queen album this is a good choice. If you are new with Queen this might be a start. I recommend it to everyone who likes Queen, or just to pop/rock-fans. This is a good album, a shame of the several stupid songs.<br />Keep On ROcking!!!!!!!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|Progressive rock in recent years has become a relative term to describe music that is in fact progressive rock and others that are close to it and don't fit any better into anything else.  If you want to know what true progressive rock is all about, you have to own Images and Words by Dream Theater.<br /><br />Dream Theater is a band that has not only been huge in Europe and most every where else in Europe (except the U.S. it seems) but they've also helped inspire and mold many other bands.<br /><br />My favorite song on this album, which I believe also if still their biggest U.S. radio hit, is called \\"Pull Me Under\\".  This is a 8:14 gem that displays what Dream Theater has come to be known for: amazing vocals and instrumentals.  These guys flat out know how to play their instruments.<br /><br />For those who are relatively new to the term Progressive Rock you may look at the track listing and wonder if it's worth buying for only 8 songs.  One thing you'll find with this particular genre of music is that the songs are longer than the normal song.  Track listing with time of songs are:<br /><br />Pull Me Under 8:14<br /><br />Another Day 4:24<br /><br />Take The Time 8:21<br /><br />Surrounded 5:30<br /><br />Metropolis-Part I (The Miracle And The Sleeper) 9:32<br /><br />Under A Glass Moon 7:04<br /><br />Wait For Sleep 2:32<br /><br />Learning To Live 11:30<br /><br />As you can see, 5 of the 8 songs are 7 minutes or longer.  When you listen to this album, you won't be listening to music, you'll be going on a journey.  Buy this album and let the journey begin...
B000002N1E|5.0|While the \\"Gold Experience\\" doesn't cover the myriad history of popular music as \\"Sign 'o The Times\\" or the \\"Symbol\\" album does, what it does deliver is something that most popular performers and bands don't deliver: intellegence and style.  <br /> <br />This recording came out in 1995 after \\"failing\\" with the \\"Symbol\\" recording and the \\"Prince is dead\\" \\"Come\\" recording.  <br /> <br />To say that Prince was heading in a different direction is a misnomer, because none of his recordings sound much like the other ones unless it serves his musical purpose. And yet, with the beginning of this recording, it was clear to those who have studied Prince over the years that this was a clear break from the \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\", \\"Purple Rain\\" and the \\"Sign O'The Times\\" eras. This was Prince at odds with Warner Brothers. This was Prince who was sick of being told how much, when and where he could record. This was Prince starting to break away from the \\"music business\\" mold that still operates on premises that started with rock and roll in the mid-1950's.  <br /> <br />Warner Brothers really slammed Prince by making fun of his \\"symbol\\" name while promoting this recording by annoucing this CD with a bunch of squiggly lines as if to say here is Prince and Prince is weird, thus, making a statement that Prince couldn't market himself the way he saw fit. <br /> <br />As for the CD, well, it didn't sell well and Prince balked that the package was not promoted enough and correctly. Incidently, this is the last full blown album of specific new music intended to be sold as a package. \\"Chaos and Disorder\\" and some other \\"NPG\\" projects fulfilled his contract and he became an idependant artist, recording, packaging and marketing any future projects on his own. As many of you already know, the first recording of this era is \\"Emancipation\\". <br /> <br />Prince is still hands down the most talented and visionary artist of all time. You will never hear \\"manufactured music\\" coming from Prince. One or two songs here and there might sound like it, but once you break down the music and/or the words, you'll realize that every note has it's place and every word has a meaning. Even if that meaning is obscure, I challenge you to listen as you may find something you didn't expect to find....yourself. <br />
0062502182|4.0|I found this book very young fresh, I so enjoyed his lessons. The Omens too, it's okay to have diversions, enjoy them, learn, then move on, then you can teach the lessons learned to those who need them. The end of the book was perfect!
B00003CXA2|2.0|Should you be like Forrest Gump and do everything the authorities tell you to do?<br /><br />Forrest Gump is destined to become an American movie classic and the one which Tom Hanks will be remembered for. Forrest Gump is dumb, yet he is extraordinarily persistent and virtuous. His character strengths allows him to achieve extraordinary deeds, such as becoming a world class ping pong player, a famous marathon runner, and a war hero.<br /><br />The antithesis of Forrest is an intelligent Berkley anti-War student. He is against the Vietname War because it violates his conscience. He also beats his girlfriend and is the antagonist of the movie.<br /><br />Why protest a war which the historians will conclude as the most indefensible in American History? Be like Forrest, don't think, and just do as authorities tell you, even if it means killing others. The fact this movie came out in mid-90s when the Vietnam War had all but been condemned as an unneccessary mistake makes this point even more disturbing.<br /><br />To be sure, Gary Sinese played a pivotal role of glorifying those who heroically sacrificed in Vietnam. But I felt the anti-war protesters should have been given their credit for the sacrifices they made in the name of justice and humanity.<br /><br />Americans should never strive to be like Forrest. Being dumb and ignorant is not a virtue. Blind submission to authorities will often lead to demise of the freedom and democracy in the society. Just read what the Founding Fathers of this great country had to say about the subject. In this sense, this was ironically a very Un-American movie with a sinister theme.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie has to rank up with my worst movies I ever seen!!!! Well 2nd one is not too bad. Um..... No I will take that it's just as bad as this one! Don't buy this, nor rent it!

B000AGTPUA|3.0|I sat down to watch this on DVD with my five-year-old granddaughter, not expecting very much because of the general poverty (in my opinion) of most kid's animated films. On the other hand, I'm a librarian and I'm aware of the high regard in which Chris Van Allsburg's book is held by children's librarians. And I confess I was impressed -- mostly -- with how well the film carried out the art and action of the book. It's not a \\"straight\\" animation, in that it uses 3D motion-capture techniques to give the characters lifelike movements. Tom Hanks does a surprisingly good job voicing the conductor and Santa and all the other adult males, even if he can't sing worth a damn. And, having grown up around railroaders, I loved the details of the train itself. On the other hand, my granddaughter was very uneasy during the vertiginous runaway-train scenes. I know a lot of animated-film fans hated this movie, but it wasn't bad.
B00005JOFO|5.0|What I love about this movie is it touches on the raw emotion of a rural man who feels he has to prove himself as a man to himself because of his sexual identity.<br /><br />This movie has touched me in a very personal way. The life I have chosen to live started with roots similar to that of Enis and Jack. I had a friend once that I loved. However, I cherished our friendship so much that I was unwilling to cross that line for fear of losing the friend. I can recall a time, after our friendship was deeply engrained in my consciousness, when I was lying in bed next to him. I wanted so bad to have the courage to reach over and touch his chest. Or like Jack did in the movie grab his arm and wrap it around my body. Thinking back to this moment in my life still makes my heart race. It was a pivotal moment in my life one that has stayed with me for fifteen years.<br /><br />I hadn't thought about this friend in quite some years. After a failed move to Oregon to try to live up there, he and later I, returned to our hometown. Our friendship was rekindled after a few rough months. I was able to tell him that I loved him. I hoped that it was understood what I meant. The timing of my disclosure more than likely hid the true meaning of the words. Although I stopped the truck and looked directly in his eyes to tell him I loved him, it was at a time when I was also forgiving him for the decision he made to date my girlfriend. I was hurt by their decision to date, but more hurt by the lack of honesty between us. Several months later they told me they were getting married. I loved them both and told them that I had no awkward feelings. Soon after their wedding I moved to San Diego to start a life of my own. I kept in contact with them through my ex-girlfriend. Sadly over time the connections diminished. After they were divorced, I received word from her. However, I was never able to reconnect with him.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain has stirred a huge stew of emotions in me. Having been raised in the High Sierra's I know what those mountains hold. There is a tranquility of being up there, removed from everything. There is a sense of being connected to Creator, being one with the world.

B00080ZG10|3.0|I'm not that big a fan of biopics. They tend to be black-or-white, laudatory or steeped in evilness, depending on the subject. I'm also not that crazy about pretty-boy DiCaprio, this decade's Johnny Depp. Having said all that, there's some good stuff in this film. The early part is overly episodic, jumping ahead a year or a decade from one scene to the next, and the dialogue in the opening scene is especially hard to follow. But it doesn't really matter because the opening scene contributes very little to the rest of the film, in which Hughes springs forth full-grown as a genius engineer and film-maker with no indication of how he was educated or trained himself. The bulk of the action is late-1930s to late-1940s, focusing on the Hercules transport (the \\"Spruce Goose\\") and Hughes' development of the XF-11 spy plane and his breaking various world records for speed and distance, and also on his affairs with Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. I understand why the story didn't follow him into the Las Vegas years and all that, but still, the biographical info included was extremely selective. There's no mention of his marriages and children, for instance. The flying sequences are interesting and the crash-sequence is heart-stopping in its true-to-life details, but you can't make a whole film out of just that. I'd say this one was about fifty percent successful.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I was incredibly moved by this film, and the incredible performances, notably Sissy Spacek's- her performance is so subtle and subdued and you really feel your heart wrench when you find how the character lost her children through no fault of her own. Haunting, and it stayed with me til this day. Sissy is one of the world's finest actresses. <br />And all in all this is a beautiful, subtle touchimg film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FIREFLY is one of the most fiercely loved cult television shows ever made, and it greatly deserves to be. In its abbreviated only season, it managed to produce such a memorably palpable universe and set of characters that it was eventually allowed to continue its story in a film version, SERENITY, that did not do as well as hoped in its theatrical release but that has enjoyed enough success on its DVD run that it has produced a whole new set of fans curious about the original show (myself included). Its central idea is elegantly simple: set in a future analogous to the Reconstruction after the American civil war, a group of renegades, led by a soldier on the rebellion's losing side, try to make ends meet by accepting dubious work smuggling goods (and even sometimes pulling heists) in a very corruptly run political system. The brooding romantic captain and his cohort form the nucleus of the band, with her jokester husband, a tough hired muscle, a sweet-tempered mechanic, a stiff doctor, his mysterious and emotionally disturbed younger sister, and an extremely ethical preacher forming the rest of the group. Oh, and of course in this homage to John Ford's STAGECOACH there is also a (state licensed) prostitute with a heart of gold, whose ongoing bantering love-hate relationship with the captain forms one of the highlights of the entire series (and seems surprisingly fresh). <br /> <br />The episodes are written more like miniature films than typical television hour-long shows, and there's usually a fine sense of atmosphere (moreover, the special effects are surprisingly sophisticated and convincing). The tone from episode to episode can shift dramatically, from very jokey episodes to very haunting or grim ones. The show's creator Joss Whedon is best known for his earlier series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, but FIREFLY is surprisingly quite different in style and type from BUFFY, although it retains the very best things about that earlier (and more widely popular) series: the strong and original characters, the funny and unexpected banter, and most of all the emphasis on community and on heart.
B000000OU4|4.0|Before all of us purist Metheny-adicts go Berkshire and accuse PMG of selling out to the evil Kenny G, let's have a little faith that Pat actually knows what he's doing here and that this is an honest effort to expand the already broad horizons of the PMG jazz landscape.    I know. The entire album is set to what initially sound like canned drum machine loops that would seem to render Paul Wertico's presence moot. It is initially tempting to think that Warner Brothers pressured Pat into producing something that would appeal to the main-stream smooth jazz radio audience, but I don't think this is the case.     For all of it's obvious and deliberate pop orientation, there are enough pure jazz notions in all of the compositions to render the CD still head and shoulders above anything any \\"smoothy\\" journeyman could ever hope to produce. It's almost as if Pat was saying, \\"OK. I'll come down on your level just this once and with nine fingers tied behind my back I'll still show you hacks how it's done.\\"    Even in this dumbed-down format, the chord progressions are musically mature, the instrumentation lush, and the soloing far more harmonically advanced than anything the rest of the smooth crowd wishes it could achieve.    In the end, \\"We Live Here\\" is a production up to PMG standards that passes the listenability test. I am still more likely to grab \\"Watercolors\\" or \\"Letter From Home\\" first, but for a change of pace and to ameliorate my wife (who does not share my intense appreciation for jazz but does like this CD) on those long car rides around Dallas/Fort Worth, WLH easily passes muster.

B00008PRR9|2.0|This album is in my girlfriend's dad's collection. Most of the songs are teenie 60s Whitey-McWhite romance pulp. (I love you; you know I'll be true etc) A few classics on the album, but I can't believe how many stars people are giving it.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|What can one say about \\"Sex and the City\\" it was a bold show that took chances and wasn't afraid to be blunt about dating and sex.  Each character as their own individual voice and personality that it makes it such a treat to see all of their different views on situations.  Samantha, the free spirit, who is very much in touch with her sexuality and knows how to use it.  Charlotte, the hopeless romantic who is on a constant search for her prince charming.  Miranda, the slightly cynical one of the group who wonders if there ever truly is a happily ever after.  Carrie, has a bit of all three in her which probably makes her the most relatable one of the four because all of us have a bit of Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda in us.  The show provided a great in depth look on the relationships and friendships between these four women and how dating isn't always the great thing it's made out to be in movies and other tv shows.  It was honest in it's portrayal and how tough it is to date. <br />     I applaud each of the actresses because with out them and their perfect chemistry together the show wouldn't be the hit that it became.  This DVD set is a real treat for fans of the series, it would have been a great set even if it was just the episodes themselves with no special features.  The bonus disc is a nice touch to the set with games and little video montages of the characters and quotes from the series.  However, my favorite feature is the farewell tribute on the season 6 (part 2) set.  The tribute has all of the actors and creators comment on the show and how it became the huge success it turned out to be.  So for anyone who is debating about getting this set, I say go for it because not only do you get fantastic, quality episodes, you also get a beautiful package for the set filled with photos, episode guide and great bonus features.  Only thing I wish was included were bloopers because I'm sure with a show like Sex and the City, there must have been some terrificbloopers.
B00005JO1P|3.0|I went into this movie expecting to be blown away by how JOhnny Cash became THE great Johnny cash. When I stepped out of the cinema, I had nothing but great admiration and respect for his first wife, Vivian Cash. My golly! What grief that woman must have suffered putting up with her hubby's self-indulgent habits.  Hats off to Vivian.  That kind of loyal and stoic woman is a rarity nowadays. She deserves a monument or a tribute of sorts.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Can't add much to the piles of praise already heaped on it except to reiterate that it stands solidly on it's own two feet as a touching and haunting album; and is an astonishingly evocative \\"recall\\" device if you've seen the movie-- something not many film scores actually acheive.  Beautiful.
B00008WJBU|2.0|A one-line summary of this movie makes it sound fascinating:  Proven lucky people (sole survivors of plane crashes and car accidents, for instance) compete in high-stakes, ultimately deadly \\"Who's really the luckiest?\\" competitions. It's a great concept, really, but it's told in a very confusing, poorly edited way so you never really quite understand what's goin on.  There's some references to people's luck being drained from them when one of the other luckies touches them, but this is never really explained satisfactorily. The characters' storylines are never really fleshed out to let us know who's who and what their relationships are to each other.  Still, there are some nice moments in the film...the scene of all the blindfolded luckies running full-speed through a dense forest until only one is left standing comes to mind. Sadly, the whole of the movie is far less satisfying than parts such as this.
1563894696|5.0|A sequel of sorts to Frank Miller's classic Batman: Year One, the Long Halloween finds longtime partners writer Jeph Loeb and artist Tim Sale delivering one of the best Batman stories ever crafted.  Gotham City is in the tight grip of crime lord Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone, and in an effort to bring him down, Batman, Gordon, and DA Harvey Dent make a pact to bring him to justice.  What unfolds is a year long mystery when a killer dubbed Holiday begins killing members of the Falcone crime organization on a different holiday each month, while Falcone scrambles to save his empire by enlisting the help of various villains.  You've got to hand it to Loeb, he's really made something special here; a subtle, noir-ish crime saga that sucessfully illustrates the transition from organized crime running rampant in Gotham City to the reign of Batman's infamous rogues gallery.  More than that though, the Long Halloween also gives a worthy transformation of the determined DA Harvey Dent and his tragic ordeal that turns him into the deranged Two-Face.  Many other classic Batman villains are here as well, including the Joker, the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, Solomon Grundy, the Riddler, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman as well who plays both sides against each other.  Tim Sale's art is about what you'd expect from him: lush and beautiful with a noir-ish look that really makes this TPB all the sweeter.  All in all, if you want an excellent Batman story that isn't written by Frank Miller, look no further.
B000002UAF|5.0|Hard Days Night is the soundtrack from their blockbuster first movie.  The Movie has no plot actually. The whole premise is the Beatles preparing for a concert, while Paul's Uncle is out and about getting into mischief. It is however a very good vehicle for the Beatles to showcase their new songs. It shows the Beatles doing their music with a Groucho Marx type dialogue. You hear several one liners such as George Harrison being asked, \\"What do you call that hair style\\", his answer being, \\"Arthur\\". The movie is very silly but recalls the times and where the Beatles were at that time.  There are some funny scenes and its a great way to hear their music.  Hard Days Night is of course the title tracks along with I Should Have Known Better.  You also get two beautiful ballads in If I Fell and with And I Love Her. Cant Buy Me Love is also included along with I'll be back Again.  This is an outstanding album musically and the soundtrack to a very fun movie, I would recommend both.....enjoy

B000003BF1|5.0|Let it Bleed was an obvious response to the Beatles Let it Be. This album was recorded when the Rolling Stones were in the process of Brian Jones leaving the group. This was a change for the Rolling Stones. In my mind this era was the finest in their career.  Let it Bleed has the classis, Give me Shelter, The Robert Johnson blues song, Love in Vain.  It also has Live with Me which is a great rocker, and the title track Let it Bleed.  Midnight Rambler is also a classic.  You've got the Silver is one of the first singing efforts from Keith Richards. You cant always get what you Want ends the album in top form.  This to me is a breakout album for the Rolling Stones and one of the few that have great songs from beginning to end.  This without a doubt is their finest album ever.........enjoy
B0000035GN|5.0|This is invariably the best Sebadoh album. It gives you all of the jagged, messed up guitar parts you could ever really need. You really have to love the erroneous discription given below: I am also dusting off my copy of Bakesale, having not listened to it in a long time, and I can assure you that there is nothing hi-fi about it. If you're not convinced, you only have to listen to the first two seconds of magnet's coil to realize: those are acoustic guitars being played through distortion. Nice. I just would have liked to see these guys before they split. Oh, well.
B000BP86OG|2.0|Coming of an overrated first album, this album is abit more easy to listen to, but the problem is that the singer just isn't very good. Also, the songs are just weak! There are only 4 decent tracks here: <br /> <br />One Way Ticket <br />Bald <br />Hazel Eyes <br />Is It Just Me <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and download these songs for 99 cents each and just skip the rest of the album. It's just too dull and the guitarwork is kinda repetitive. <br /> <br />Oh, and Hawkins bad vocals show the worst on the ballads. <br /> <br />ouck!

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Rs really is a special band. I discovered them a few years ago after watching the terrific movie \\"Vanilla Sky\\". Their song at the end of the movie really captured and highlighted the transcendental, heavenly, and elated mood at the end of the movie. Sigur Rs consistently manages to set this very atmosphere at any given time.  <br /> <br />Along with only a select few albums this year, I anticipated the release of Takk..., and bought it the first day it was released. Oh boy. The album starts off perfectly, just teasing you for what is to come with the first title track. Then, Glsli  begins, in a floating blend of delicate sounds, finally exploding in a big bang of electric guitar. I knew the album would not disappoint. Besides the Glsli , Hopppolla, Sglpur, Gong, and Heystan are amazing, ethereal tracks. Yet, the other songs are completely essential as well. They serve as beautiful transitions and need not be skipped.  <br /> <br />Sigur Rs's back catalogue is admirably good as well. Looking for more of the experience, I looked to \\"similar\\" bands like Mogwai, Mum, and Godspeed You Black Emperor. Though these albums have their sonic climaxes, they often sound meandering, unfocused, boring, and annoying at times. I don't really need more bands like this anyway. I can (and have) listen to Takk... all the time without tiring of it. Sigur Rs is king at this type of music.  <br /> <br />I really can't see how anyone could not like this album, unless they are just too engrossed in the mainstream to value this music. Either way, this is definitely one my favorites, A Best Album of 2005
B00005JKOI|5.0|Pretty in Pink takes us back to the era of the brat pack which included Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, and Ally Sheedy..... I love this movie because of its story and of course is because its a classic from a decade that i really loved a lot which is the 80's...... Movies now these days don't deliever like the ones from the 80's and not only that but with movies from that decade were basic and had great storylines so if you are going with a collection of old movies then you should put this classic in there.....
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|That's how the incomparably magical nanny Mary Poppins describes herself with nary a boastful smirk on a revealing tape measure in this still charming 1964 Disney classic musical set in post-Victorian London circa 1910. I was five years old when it was originally released, and I managed to convince my mother to take me to see it six times. I just saw it last night for the first time in over four decades on the big screen in a sing-along version similar to what has been done with \\"The Sound of Music\\". I still feel a genuine warmth about this movie as an adult. Such was the impact of Julie Andrews in her big screen debut, as she epitomizes the title character with equal quantities of starch and sugar.<br /><br />With her unyielding posture, coltish stature and perfectly clipped diction, Andrews found her archetypal role before she even blossomed as an actress, an intractable goody-goody image she sends up mercilessly 17 years later in her husband's savage Hollywood satire, \\"S.O.B.\\" There is no getting around the fact that she is ideal as the indefatigable Mary in charge of Jane and Michael, the two moppet children of neglectful banker George Banks and his flighty suffragette wife Winifred. With the help of devoted friend Bert, a Cockney jack-of-all-trades and one-man-band, Mary sets out to inspire the children's imaginations while keeping a firm though kind-hearted hand on their behavior. What I notice this time as an adult is how Mary wields a similarly positive influence on George albeit after much patriarchal consternation and sexist-driven protest.<br /><br />There are so many delightful scenes that it's hard to choose which to highlight, though one of the best ones has to be the fantasy animated sequence through Bert's sidewalk painting. This is where Bert dances with the penguins, Mary leads Bert and her charges on liberated carousel horses through a foxhunt and a horserace, and both sing two of the best songs, \\"Jolly Holiday\\" and \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\". Another wonderful scene is the \\"Spoonful of Sugar\\" room clean-up scene with obviously mechanized robins and a bevy of stop-action effects. Using an overemphatic Cockney accent as Bert, Dick Van Dyke - who was then starring in his classic sitcom - is an endearing presence and a dexterous comic dancer. He also clowns around in heavy make-up as the very aged president of the bank at which George works.<br /><br />David Tomlinson plays George with appropriate gruffness under his gentlemanly demeanor, while Glynis Johns lends her ingratiating quality to Winifred. The children are played without affectation by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. Veteran character actors fill the rest of the roles expertly in what amounts to extended cameos - Ed Wynn as the eternally laughing and perpetually airborne Uncle Albert; Elsa Lanchester as Mary's frustrated predecessor, Katie Nanna; Arthur Treacher as the kindly Constable Jones; Reginald Owen as the delusional sea captain next door, Admiral Boom; Hermione Baddeley and Reta Shaw as the Banks's constantly flustered maids; and most touchingly, the 85-year old Jane Darwell (Ma Joad in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\") as the bird woman on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral.<br /><br />The songs by the Sherman Brothers, Richard and Robert, are truly enchanting and memorable after all these years, especially the haunting \\"Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)\\", the wistful \\"Chim-Chim-Cheree\\", and the almost \\"My Fair Lady\\"-sounding \\"The Life I Lead\\". I still have a few quibbles, for example, the \\"Step in Time\\" dance sequence is exceptionally choreographed but too darkly lit and goes on a bit too long to enjoy fully. Moreover, at 140 minutes, the movie drags a bit toward the end especially as George meets with the board of his bank. Regardless, director Robert Stevenson, who made many of the live-action Disney films of the 1960's, along with screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, have concocted what has to be one of the best family-oriented confections to come out of the Hollywood studios.ed confections to come out of the Hollywood studios.

B000E41MRC|5.0|This is the WW2 era documentary film by Leni Riefenstahl. Tells of the rise to power of the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler. Outstanding documentary for those interested in the Nazi era and the propaganda films shown in Germany to \\"sell\\" Hitler's message to the German people. A VERY powerful film.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|Okay, I'm sorry for the sarcastic headline. I'll get to my point on that later. This is a good movie, actually. It's not a GREAT movie, but considering the mixed reviews it received upon its release, it earns a special place on that 'better-than-you-think-it's-going-to-be' shelf.  <br /> <br />Now, one reason \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is better than you think it's going to be is that it's not just some schlocky teen horror flick. Instead, this is a smart, thoughtful look at the sometimes rocky relationship between faith and science. On one side sits Father Moore, a Catholic priest, on trial for negligent homicide after a failed exorcism and the death of a young woman. On the other, a prosecutor - himself a religious man - certain that the afflictions suffered by the title character are easily explained by medical science.  <br /> <br />In the middle, along with the film's defense attorney, sits most of the moviegoing public. We think of ourselves as rational, after all...but not so rational that we don't sympathize with the priest. And to side with Father Moore, we have to at least accept - maybe to some extent, share - his belief that demons exist and that they sometimes take possession of people. Along with the defense attorney (played to just the right pitch by Laura Linney), we're forced to ask ourselves if science can adequately explain the condition of Emily Rose or if maybe - just maybe - hers is a case of genuine demonic possession.  <br /> <br />To be sure, there are horrific moments in this film. It moves along with a good number of thrills and chills to go along with its courtroom story, but it really isn't a horror movie. Unlike most modern horror flicks, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is a film with a philosophical center. At its heart, it's about what \\"Exorcist\\" director William Friedkin once called `the mystery of faith.' It's the question of why some perfectly intelligent people believe in things they can't see, measure or prove while others don't.Father Moore, after all, is no religious nutjob and is never painted as such. He's a reasonable man and, unlike the prosecutor, he witnessed firsthand the events in the life of Emily Rose that led to her death.  <br /> <br />It's to director Scott Derrickson's credit that we're not given any easy answers. Sure, Father Moore is the good guy, but Derrickson doesn't merely discount the opinions of doctors who testify that Emily Rose was mentally and physically ill - not demonically possessed. In fact, the director goes so far as to show various of Emily's `episodes' as if they're rooted in different causes: the same event is presented once as demonic attack, once as epileptic seizure. It's a smart move, and one that asks the viewer to think a bit rather than merely suspend disbelief. And it puts us in the same position of the defense attorney - we have some need to believe Father Moore, but we can't merely ignore the testimony of doctors who have examined Emily Rose. <br /> <br />If there's one real flaw in this film, it's that the courtroom drama progresses just a bit too much as if it's made for TV (hence the headline). Contrivances designed to move the trial along may play just fine with teens, but not with anyone who's even spent so much as a day on jury duty. (This is not to say that courtroom dramas have to be especially realistic, but this one, in certain moments, seems slapped together with no regard for reality at all.) On the flipside of the coin, the very look of the courtroom itself is mundane, almost dreary. We spend a lot of time in court in this movie, and the filmmakers might have thought to make it look just a little more cinematic.  <br /> <br />These are small complaints, though. Despite the interpretation put forth in several reviews, this film never tells us, definitively, whether or not Emily Rose is actually possessed...but still doesn't leave us feeling gypped To its credit, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" gives us a little something to think aboutwithout having to spoon-feed us the answers to the questions it poses.   <br />
B00005JO20|5.0|Kudos to Peter Jackson ! Whatever you may think of the 1933 and 1976 versions, at least NOW you know there will never be a need to re-make King Kong ever again. This movie is exciting at every turn, perfectly cast and the obvious result of a labor of love. It pays homage to the original with many subtle details such as the credits, the dialogue on the \\"film within the film\\" and the music during Kong's broadway presentation. Even the original score, with composers replaced in the last couple of months of production, turned out superb ! Here's hoping this DVD version is more than just an appetizer for \\"an extended platinum, ultimate version\\" or whatever they may wish to call it.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is an amazing show and it makes an amazing CD. Idina Menzel's voice is awe-inspiring, and paired with Kristen Chenoweth's voice it's incredible. The two best songs on this CD would have to be \\"For Good\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\". It's a great CD and I would highly recommend it.
6304698623|5.0|I watched this last night with my 9-year old daughter.  She woke up this morning and watched it again.   What an enjoyable movie! Sara is a young girl who speaks her mind, and shows great compassion to others.  She is a strong little girl.  It is a beautifully filmed movie, with a captivating soundtrack.  It does, as other reviewers have pointed out, stray significantly from the book. But, the ending of this movie is so satisfying!  I think that a PG rating might have been more appropriate, given the two brief (but visually intense) WWI scenes.  It's not a movie for preschoolers (in part because of the thematic elements).  However, I don't think the intensity of this movie is any greater than some Disney films.  All in all, a great family film, but I would personally preview it before deciding if it is appropriate for a young elementary school student.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Most of these reviews are probably preaching to the choir, but I just wanted to play my part (however small it may be) to help sustain the Firefly universe. For those of you who haven't seen the TV series, please do. The movie becomes more rich because you better understand the characters and their relationships to one another. But Serenity definitely stands well on its own. Great storytelling, and a cast that gels very well together. And I don't think you have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this movie since the writing is so good. And there's plenty of action to keep you entertained.  I just hope DVD sales are strong enough to warrant a sequel. Looks pretty good so far.
B0000033P0|3.0|ELP was nothing if not theatrical. On stage, Keith Emerson stabbed his organ with a knife and played it backwards while Carl Palmer thrashed on his kit like Keith Moon smashing up a hotel room. That kind of aggression is difficult to transfer to disk. Sometimes ELP was great on wax, other times not. Tarkus, because it makes little attempt at subtlety is a bit like a carnival ride: you mostly enjoy it, but when it's finished, you feel a little sick. Tarkus attacks you from the beginning with keyboard pounding that reminds one of Dave Brubeck's \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk.\\" For the rest of side one, there's little let up. Side two is not as good, and it contains a tasteless reference to the Holocaust. The album ends with an ill-advised Jerry Lee Lewis-esque throwaway, \\"Are you Ready, Eddie?\\" Tarkus is must listening for ELP fans. For those that are lukewarm about the band, this record will leave you exhausted and thinking, \\"This is the same band that did Lucky Man?\\" Brain Salad Surgery is more consistently good, but with Tarkus, you gotta give ELP credit for trying hard.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of Jane Austin's very best novels.  The movie is wonderful and as usual she makes us wait until the very end to know if the true love of all characters will work out right. <br /> <br />Collin Firth is so handsome, even if he never smiles.  He plays the chacture of Mr. Darcy so well.  The plot of the movie is as wonderful as all of Jane Austin's books.  The movie will not leave you disappointed and the price cannot be beat.  Enjoy!
0553801503|3.0|The book was a dissappointment - especially with the long wait. Most of the reviewers are right on - the book was too long, too little happening. In places it read like a geneology text rather than a novel. Still the world Martin has invented is a wonderful place, with many great stories either told or waiting to be told. Let's just hope they have an editor involved when they are!
0743454537|5.0|This was a really wonderful, poignant novel. Jodi did a great job of helping you to see the story from each character's perspective. This made it twice as hard to decide which viewpoint to side with, much less to then stick with that decision once you'd made it. It really made you think about life and how you'd react if you were in Anna's place.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|First off, I highly recommend the widescreen version of this DVD over the full screen.  When Joss Whedon created the world of Firefly and Serenity, he designed it specifically to be viewed in widescreen (both the TV show and the movie), so to watch it any other way means that you won't be seeing it as the director intended.   <br /> <br />This DVD also has a neat little Easter Egg buried inside.  On the main menu, if you highlight \\"Play\\" and hit left, you will highlight a marker on the right side of the menu.  Hit enter, and you'll get to watch a short clip about the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial (what River was watching before she went all fight happy the first time). <br /> <br />The movie itself is wonderful, for both fans of Firefly and people who have never seen the series, and I think the DVD has some nice extras that make it well worth the purchase.
0451169514|4.0|Something is terrorizing Derry, Maine. Something that preys upon children. An insidious evil that only seems to reappear every 27 years before slipping away once more.     It's not until the summer of 1969, when 7 kids band together in an attempt to face down this horror. Their leader, Bill, has a personal score to settle with what they've come to call IT. His  little brother, George, was killed by IT, setting off the most recent rash of murders.     However, the kid's attempt is unsuccessful, and it's not until 27 years later, that they are again reunited to try and destroy IT once and for all.    This is a very creepy book. However, I think it's a little bit too long! That aside, IT was still enjoyable.    I liked how Pennywise was something different for every kid in the book who saw him. For one, a werewolf. For another, a mummy. He wasn't always merely a clown, which most people have enough trouble dealing with as it is. Pennywise essentially embodied whatever each character feared the most and literally brought it to life... while sometimes taking a life.     There are some great scenes in the story, like when Georgie's photo album takes on a life of its own and the pictures begin to move. Or, when an adult Bev returns to her childhood home.     At the same time.. I didn't care for the scene towards the end of the book involving the childhood Bev and the boys as they were trying to find their way out of the tunnel. I felt it was unnecessary to the story and King went a little too far. I know I'm being cryptic in regards to what actually happened.. but I don't want to give everything away.     For that matter, the ending of the book and the final showdown with IT was kind of strange. I don't think it meshed that well with the rest of the story. Plus it was a little bit 'out there' and somewhat of a letdown, especially since it takes you 1,000+ pages to get there! I expected somewhat better.    All in all, I'd recommend this book, but wouldn't say it's my favorite Stephen King novel.
0440238609|5.0|Although I am not a big fan of scifi/fantasy stories, I found these books to be so well-written and enjoyable!  The stories are packed full of action, adventure, ethics, personal growth, and wonderfully creative visualization. As a homeschooling family, I am always on the lookout for good reading material for my kids.  These books are a bit beyond my 8 year old's reading ability, but will be our read-aloud books for now.  I personally think they are a bit more complex than the Redwall series and Harry Potter (both of which we love.)  I think any kid who likes Harry would like these books. Unlike Redwall stories, tho, these need to be read in order.
0140177396|5.0|In less than one hundred and ten pages John Steinbeck will acquaint you with an entire farm full of people and make you believe that each person filling it is a desperate loner.  In the same number of pages some authors use to kick off a story, Of Mice and Men builds such suspense that you'll develop the hiccups with the irregular breathing you'll take up from holding your breath and then exhaling.  This is Steinbeck's most well known novel, and although it is heavy on dialogue, it's entirely about loneliness, and about the inherent flaws in everything down to nature itself. <br />  <br />A few miles south of a city named Solitude in the Spanish tongue, sit Lenny and George: Two wandering immigrant workers desperately clinging to their own American dream of someday living off the fat of their own piece of land.  The latter is scrappy and sharp and with a quick wit while the other is a large dull man with the intelligence of a child and the innocence to match.  They're both on the run and need new jobs, and so they turn into a farm and make friendly with the cast of characters.   <br /> <br />Since this is a short book, anymore would be a spoiler that would jeopardize the readers' incentive to pick up this fine novel.  I can tell you that it's written beautifully.  It is a book of Men and Mice, of dogs and rabbits, of jealous husbands and discontent wives, of old men and young fit farmhands, and then despair.   I can't read the first page without hearing classical music and I stop every time to think of the warm water flowing through the river splashing against my face, the sun beating down on my head, and the feel of the grass by the river bank. None of the characters' emotions are ever described, but you feel them at every turn.  Your heart will twist with the plot and you might even feel the thermostat drop a bit when you've hit the last page. <br /> <br />The story's fast pace might buck you occasionally.  In the name of expediency Steinbeck would have characterspop in and out of each others life in a very convenient - and unrealistic - matter as though he were writing a play, which this story was to be originally.  If I didn't enjoy the quick transition from one scene to the next so much, I might consider this a flaw, but considering the alternative (having characters and the readers bumble around for pages on end) I can forgive it and see it as a quirk.  John Steinbeck has captured the quick clip manner of writing and penned a classic.  His book has touched countless with his study of the universal theme of loneliness and will doubtless bound countless more to his pages.  This is a timeless classic and one you can read in a single sitting.            <br />
B00000DRE1|2.0|I am a true blue W.A.S.P fan, but this CD is just not worth it. I see what Blackie was trying to do here, but he just didn't pull it off. However, he did redeem himself years later with another epic CD titled The Neon God, which is excellent especially on tunes like ASYLUM #9, ME AND THE DEVIL, WHY AM I NOTHING? oh, that whole album rocks. Pass up The Crimson Idol...go buy THE NEON GOD, you can thank me later.
B0000696I0|5.0|Yes, it's corny.  But this is early 90s.  Everything back then was cool at the time, but corny today.  This movie took everything the first movie did, but made it HUGE.  More mutants, ooze, a friggen 90s style hip hop dance even (this was popular at the time, remember the Urkel Dance?). <br /> <br />All the actors did a good job.  The new asian kid had some slick martial arts abilities, and his fresh, headstrong attitude added much to this movie.  Even the British dude from Titanic was good.  The ninja rap at the end of the movie is hilarious to watch today, but at the time was the coolest thing on the planet.  I remember seeing people in the theater cheering, getting out of their chairs and singing along to it.  It was nuts.  Gotta love it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is an incredible achievement. It squeezes at least 2 seasons of TV storytelling into 2 hours, while making the story and characters clear to viewers who missed Firefly.<br /><br />I saw it twice at the theatre so I have only watched the DVD once so far but I look forward to watching it on a semi-annual basis (like I do with the original Star Wars on laserdisc). Of course, first I have to work my way back through 7 seasons of Buffy!<br /><br />Joss Whedon is a great writer and a great storyteller.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|Clapton's inspiration has been replaced by some new boring forgettable elevator songs. <br />I'm sorry to say that REPTILE was a very good \\"soft\\" album for me ... This one not ! <br /> <br />I can't imagine CLapton playing these songs on stage... Hope the set of his 2006 tour won't be only based on this album... :( <br /> <br />Maybe, this time, you should try a \\"CREAM reissue\\" show on DVD ;)
B000002KMV|4.0|If you know what my title means (from the cut \\"Sexuality\\"), you've heard this album. LOVE the procussion from that tune. <br /> <br />Prince's 4th album, released in 1981, was easily the most exciting R&B album of that year. The mixture of rock and R&B was revolutionary for the times, but this album was relatively unknown outside of Black teenagers in some cities. It's important to remember that Prince was largely an underground cult artist until 1999 (the album, not the year). <br /> <br />Pretty exciting stuff. Musically, he expands upon \\"Dirty Mind's\\" formula of Rock and R&b powered anthems of sex, religion (the use of the Lord's prayer in the title cut caused outrage in many quarters), and social commentary. The content of the songs hass been well commented upon by the other reviewers. Just hear for yourself and think. <br /> <br />The original Lp had a bizarre poster of Prince in the shower next to a crucifix, which added to the title of this album living up to it's name.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Well this cd was my introduction to Enigma and what an introduction! Theres hardly a weak song on the cd and all the songs flow so amazingly into one another. The best tracks on here in my opinion are: Turn Around,Gravity of Love,T.N.T. For The Brain,sadness,Mea Culpa and Return to innocense just to name a few. If you are new to Enigma this is a great place to start.
B000002KLP|4.0|Whne I was in High school in the late 70s and early 80s, we eagerly awaited the yearly release of new Prince Albums (as the overall state of R&B was so dismal at the time). <br /> <br />This was one of his most, er..\\"interesting\\" ones. Quite shocking for 1980-81. He actually sings of the \\"joys\\" of incest with \\"Sister\\" and \\"Head,\\" well, that speaks for itself. The title tune and \\"Do It All Night\\" were not so hot. \\"Party Up\\" was quite raw for it's antiwar chant near the end (considering that the US was not actually involved in any war at the time). <br /> <br />The original album had a nice poster of Prince's original band that would be later known as the Revolution. <br /> <br />It's interesting also to consider that while the kids who listened to this in 1980-81 upset their parents by listening to \\"Dirty Mind\\", these very same kids are now upset over THEIR kids' rap cds. Go figure.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I've been an Enya Fan for many years now, and enjoyed all her previous releases and singles and the COllections immensely, but this Album, I found real dissapointing sorry. As if many of the songs, especially from the second half of the album, are low edged b-sides which never made it onto any previous release. I like about 4-5 Songs on this album at the most: - They are:  Less Than A Pearl,Amarantine,It's In The Rain,Sumiregusa and to about 80% \\"Drifting\\" (If those so irritating and somehow depressing Dark Strings werent so prevelant, 100%...Why those sooo dark strings, on this so good Instrumental I asked myself!). I ended up skipping the other tracks as I found them so bland and dull, aggreeing with other dissapointed Enya Fans too. The song: The River Sings, I find more of a Electro-Techno Influenced Chant SOng, I couldnt stand either, and know that her older Sister Moya did a far better job on that. I somehow think Enya, is somehow running out on creativity, and leans more and more towards Pop standardism and commercialisation of her music, which I find very sad, totally sad in fact. I'm not sure if I'm going to buy the next album, propably arround 2010. I'm so dissapointed, so give 3 stars for this, the first time I gave less than 5 stars to Enya.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Any unconventional artist or entertainer is bound to create a lot of controversy, particularly if they manage to gain a level of popularity, as has David Lynch.  And, as I so often do when discussing something divisive, I come down between the two major camps: No, 'Mulholland Drive' isn't utterly incomprehensible and worthless drivel, nor is it the cinematic equivalent of 'Finnegan's Wake' and a film so complex and meaningful that even the demigod Lynch who birthed is only capable of deciphering but 1/10 of it's mystery.  It's just an entertaining, artfully done little surrealist mystery-thriller thing.<br /><br />And no 'Mulholland Drive' isn't utterly incomprehensible.  In fact, I don't think it's necessarily terribly difficult to understand if you're willing to watch it twice.  I can understand why it would seem incomprehensible, however: It is flatly impossible to seriously guess at the mysteries of the first 2 hours of the film while you're actually watching them.  The answers just aren't there, period. (Well, there are some hints, obviously, but nowhere near enough to put it all together.)  And it can be pretty tough to put everything together during the final 30 minutes, and I'm sure many viewers were too irritated by the first 2 hours to even care to try at this point.  To be honest, I don't think that the mystery itself if particularly clever as far as this sorta thing goes.  Most significantly, it relies on the oldest, most hackneyed twist in the book (Spoiler alert): Two hours into the film we learn that everything that has happened up to this point is a dream. Thus you can just throw everything that happened out the window, but then use the various parts and details to assemble the reality of the situation.  Despite what many will tell you, the mystery itself isn't really that complicated.  It's mostly just vague and obscure, a substitute for intelligence and complexity in many minds, but not mine.  But, I don't hold this against Lynch too much.  First of all, I don't see this sorta film for the sake of having my mind blown by the revelations.  I just like the style and mood and general strangeness of this sorta film, and while some of them have great twists it's not the kinda thing you can rely on.  Secondly, this was originally intended to be a pilot for NBC, and thus wasn't originally intended to have an ending, so it's naturally gonna be pretty damn tough to tie things up with out being a little cheap.  And Lynch actually does a surprisingly good job of wrapping it all up, in the end, considering the circumstances.<br /><br />Now, when I say the first 2 hours of the film are utterly incomprehensible, I should specify that it's impossible to know *why* any of this is happening; what is literally going on is fairly straight forward.  The film opens with the failed assassination of an unnamed young woman (Laura Herring).  She flees into a strangers open house, and is struck with amnesia.  Shortly thereafter, Betty (Naomi Watts), a perky, naive woman straight out of a 50's film, arrives in Hollywood with hopes of becoming an actress.  She plans to live in her aunt's vacant apartment while she looks for work, and, needless to say, this happens to be where the nameless woman, shortly to be dubbed Rita, has fled.  She befriends Rita and decides to try and help her remember who she is.  There is another plot thread about the recasting of a film against the will of the director and the repercussions he experiences when he refuses, and we also follow the exploits of the assassin who still hopes to finish off Rita.  That is really about all there is to the plot as far as the first 2 hours of the film are concerned, and during I must reiterate that during this part of the film we don't learn hardly anything of the reasoning behind it all. If you stopped right after the scene in Club Silencio you'd still have no idea who Rita is, no idea who wants her dead or why, no idea why the film is being recast and no idea how these two plot threads tie together. (There are some revelations, but they just make things more confusing, for the time being.)  Still, the individual scenes do play well, and Lynch manages to make things both funny and creepy at different moments.  The stuff involving the director Kesher is generally very amusing culminating in his campy-creepy encounter encounter with a cowboy who apparently speaks for the will of the studio.  There's also a very funny scene involving the assassins severely botched killings. And there's another great scene where Betty goes to audition and is spontaneously, inexplicably hyper-dramatic.  Finally, the whole opening section of the film culminates in the ultra surreal visit to club Silencio, centering around a spanish language rendition of Roy Orbison's `Crying'.  And so on.  Through out it all the acting is strong and widely varied as the film is populated both by seemingly real people and numerous others who seem to be visiting from an alternate dimension.  Much has been made of Naomi Watts's performance, and not with out good reason.  Frankly, this is partially because of shock value, as her character in the final 30 minutes of the film is wildly different from the wide-eyed, grinning like a mental patient Betty of the first 2 hours.  I also particularly like Justin Theroux as the perpetually befuddled director Kesher.  He's kinda like the straight man of the whole film.<br /><br />I should mention that Angelo Badalamenti's score is excellent.  It's very thick and dramatic, and kinda grounds the whole film, often providing a dramatic counterpoint for the wackiness.  Good stuff.<br /><br />The final 30 minutes are a lot more straight forward than the opening 120, though shown out of chronological order. (Still, there is some very weird stuff going on at times, no doubt.)  Though they largely exist to finally provide the answers to it all this stuff has quite a bit of dramatic weight, though I can't go into specifics.<br /><br />If, upon viewing it once, you like the film at all you should really make sure to watch it again.  Though it was amusing the first time around, the opening 2 hours of the film proved a lot more interesting once you have a basic sense of what they mean, and you naturally notice things you didn't notice before.<br /><br />Many people have cursed the studio because this DVD has only 1 chapter, and there is some very brief optical censoring of some frontal nudity in a scene.  First of all, how often do you really need to stop a DVD while you're watching it anyway.  Second, both of these things were done a Lynch's behest.  So quite whining, it's his film, he can do what he wants. It does strike me as a bit odd that he'd censor himself retrospectively, but it's his choice.  Still, if it has been your life long dream to catch a glimpse of Laura Herring's pubic hair I'm sorry, this film will not allow you to fulfill that ambition.  Not anymore.<br /><br />Also, speaking of nudity, if you've ever been watching a movie and wished that the two attractive female characters would just get naked and start making out and pawing at each other for no apparent reason, well, today is your lucky day, cause that happens in this film. Twice.<br /><br />Again, this kinda thing isn't going to play with everyone, and I'm not going to tell you that you need to be oh so smart to understand the movie, and that if you don't like it you must be a dolt.  It's fairly slow-moving much of the time, and the bizarre tone may not amuse everyone, nor will its formlessness.  So, if you  demand a coherent structure form beginning to end you should avoid this, but you'll probably enjoy it if you can go with the flow for a while.<br /><br />Grade: B+se two plot threads tie together.

B000001ESF|5.0|Ok, let's start off by saying Rush is one of the best musical groups on the Earth, and congratulate them for sticking around for a hell of a long time. 30 years in a band with the same members since 1975 is pretty amazing (for all of those who didn't know, Neil Peart was not the original drummer until Fly By Night). Over the years, Rush has had it's up and down's (Caress of Steel anyone?) and they have had incredible albums(Moving Pictures, Vapor Trails), but they have always seemed to be good at almost everything they've done, whether it's hard rock, prog-rock, or hip hop (and yes, they have done hip hop, Roll the Bone's title track) they were good. But this Canadian band from Ontario wasn't always famous. From 1974-1975 they were not as famous as other bands were back then like Led Zeppelin or someone else. 2112 was their breakthrough album, with incredible guitars, to really great melodies, to really great vocals, but the vocals are kind of geekish. 2112 is based on an Ayn Rands book. Kind of science fiction, but incredible. The album starts out with 2112, a 20 minute epic, which is Overture, The Temples of Syrinx, Discovery, Presentation, Oracle:The Dream, Soliloquy, and, Grand Finale. The song's about a guy that is in the temples of Syrinx and discovers a musical device (music is outlawed) which is the guitar. He brings the guitar to the king saying that it could be useful, shows the king what it does (listen to my music) and the king rejects it. Then the guy is walking home and has a dream that it could be really useable, but at the end he commits suicide. (Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation! We have assumed control. We have assumed control.) Then is the heavily riffed A Passage to Bangkok. I think this is the guy in another life with his guitar and he is on the road to Bangkok. This song is one of the best by Rush. Then, The Twilight Zone, my favorite song from this album. It's about how the guy is, well, in the twilight zone. Then, in Lessons, helearns a lesson about what he has learned. Tears is another great ballad by Rush. It's about losing his guitar (I think that's what that song is about!). Then, the last song, Something For Nothing, my third favorite song from the album. It's about him losing his guitar and how mopey he is. Rush also continued this album with 1977's A Farewell to Kings. I have not heard that one yet, but I will soon. Then, they follow up with the story with Hemispheres. Once again, I've never heard this one, but will soon. Well, that's about it with my review of 2112. If you don't belive a word I say about this album, buy it and listen to it yourself. Not everyone likes these guys, and I understand that, but I have not seen one person who has just been an average Rush fan, only people that love them, and people that hate them. I hope if you're the person who hates them and is reading this review right now, then i hope 2112 changes your mind about them. <br />

B00005JO1Y|5.0|After I saw KING KONG I tried to think of a better remake in the history of Hollywood.  John Carpenter's THE THING is one candidate, but neither it nor the Howard Hawks original (Hawks isn't listed as having been involved with THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE, but the listed director said that Hawks was the key figure, corroborated by others) are really substantial enough to challenge.  THE MALTESE FALCON is a greater film, but though it was the second film based on Dashiell Hammett's novel by the same name, it was more a second adaptation of the novel than a remake of SATAN MET A LADY.  There have been some great adaptations of one movie to another, such as THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN of THE SEVEN SAMURAI or A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS of YOJIMBO, but adaptations are very distinct from remakes.  I think this remake takes the crown for two reasons:  it is a very good movie in its own right and it is a remake of an undisputed classic.<br /><br />There was, of course, another major remake of KING KONG, the 1976 horrific version that nearly destroyed Jessica Lange's career.  The film pretty much made hash of the original story, turning it into a weird ecological exploitation flick and ending with Kong on the World Trade Center rather than the Empire State Building.  This version is incredibly respectful of the original, sets the action at the time of the original, and constantly makes references to it.  There are many scenes that visually quote from the previous classic, none more moving than at the end of the spectacular scene in this one where Kong fights three T-Rexes to save Naomi Watts's character from extinction.  Kong punches the last T-Rex, tries to kill it by prying open its jaw, then punches it again before successfully breaking the jaw.  Then, he reaches under the jaw and flips it up a couple of times.  All of this was a direct quote from the original.<br /><br />I'm going to be honest.  When I first heard that Peter Jackson's next project after THE LORD OF THE RINGS was going to be a remake of KING KONG, I was quite upset.  There was, I felt, no demand for such a thing.  Why remake a classic instead of merely doing a film on original material.  I was wrong.  This was for me the most purely entertaining movie of 2005.<br /><br />Almost everything about this movie stands out.  The set and art design is perfect, the special effects are off the chart, and even the clothing is great.  Every shot in the entire film is just a delight to look at, from the shots of the docks and boat at the beginning to Skull Island to the wonderful shots in the jungle to the final scenes in 1930s New York.  It is filled with special effects, but unlike a George Lucas film where the special effects call attention to themselves, here they are subservient to the story.  CGI has gotten so good that you simply do not have the visual capability not to believe what it shown on the screen.  Kong himself was impossible to doubt, all the way down to his big belly and bad teeth.<br /><br />I had some initial doubts about Jack Black playing the role originally played with bombastic glee by Robert Armstrong, but he allayed my doubts.  Though he lacks Armstrong's panache in delivering the film's final famous line (\\"It wasn't the airplanes; it was beauty killed the beast.\\"), he plays Carl Denham with enthusiasm and energy.  Adrian Brody is serviceable as Jack Driscoll (played by Bruce Cabot in the original), as are all of the supporting cast members.  But the person who steals the film by doing a very believable turn as \\"the most adorable woman in the world\\" is Naomi Watts.  I have always liked Watts, but I had absolutely no conception that she could be this irresistible or this astonishingly gorgeous.  In watching her, one wonders not how a giant gorilla could fall for her charms, but how anyone could fail to.  Although everything is very well done in the film from the photography to the design to the direction to the CGI, without Naomi Watts and the clear, blue-eyed beautyof her face, it wouldn't have been the film that it turned out to be.<br /><br />Although the film is a faithful remake of the original--all the way to reinserting a scene in which many from the ship's crew fight with bugs at the beginning of a ravine that was excised from the original when the studio deemed it too frightening (in the original spiders only)--Jackson does update the story in a couple of important ways.  Primarily this consists of changing Kong's basic character and then changing the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow.  In the original Kong is presented as a lascivious, terrifying monster, completely devoid of any higher qualities.  In the uncensored version of the original Kong partially undresses Darrow with a look on his face that can only be described as lascivious.  Nothing approaching this can be found in the remake, which opens the possibility for Darrow to have a more complex relationship with Kong.  Fay Wray's Darrow could respond to Kong only with terror.  When Watts's Darrow is threatened by a three T-Rex's, Kong comes in as Darrow's savior.  The ensuing battle--one of the great achievements of the CGI age of film--with Kong heroically doing all in his power to save Darrow from the predators as they all fall off cliffs, hang from vines, and battle over the ground, with Darrow every second just inches from death, completely transforms the dynamic between Darrow and Kong.  If the remake does not contain the raw sensuality of the original, it contains a degree of affection impossible before.  The bond between Ann and Kong is reinforced at the end of the movie.  In one of the few completely original scenes in the remake, Kong and Ann find a few moments to recapture the friendship they established in the jungle when they slide around on a frozen pond in Central Park.  Then in Kong's final moments, Ann does all that she can do to try and save Kong's life.  While Fay Wray ended the film with relief that Kong was dead, Watts suffers a great sadness.  I think that in all this the new film greatly improves on the original.<br /><br />The final difference between the two films is that in the original Kong's presence in New York is primarily an occasion for horror, while in the remake it is a tragedy, with Kong as the most tragic figure.<br /><br />I have numerous friends who have expressed a total disinterest in seeing this film.  I suspect that there are many others and many may share my earlier antipathy to seeing a remake of such a familiar movie.  I strongly urge any doubters to give this film a chance.  It truly is one of the great remakes in film history, if not the greatest.  For me, this film reminded me of the reason we all go to the movies in the first place, to be taken to impossible places and witness miracle things.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|Ok, I was four years old when this movie came out.  I graduated High School in 2000, so I wasn't a teenager when I saw it.  I heard about it from my best friend Pete(whom I met in college), so I decided to check it out; I am an enormous 80's film fan.  This movie is incredibly powerful and penetrating.  They used to call movies 'moving pictures', but few actually fit the bill; this does.  It makes you laugh and cry at the same time, with it's believable characters and frank discussion of mature issues.  It has quickly become one of my favorite all time movies. I would not recommend this to the younger crowd only because of the occasional strong profanity, but for everyone else, this is a must see.    The plot is talking about five teenagers who wind up in detention together one fall afternoon in 1984.  Each one of them represents a certain ilk of society: An intellectual(anthony michael hall), an athelete(emilio esteves), a loner(ally sheedy), a criminal(judd nelson), and a prep(molly ringwald).  As the day progresses, they bare their souls to each other, each telling their own story.  They begin to understand that, though they found themselves as different as water and oil, they have a lot more in common then they realized.  Some of the one-liners were so funny that I had to listen to them multiple times: particularly from the 'criminal'.  He constantly insults the others, playing on their intelligence or their looks, one of the funniest of which is when he is poking fun at the intellectual; he goes though his lunch and, seeing how 'wholesome' it is, asks if his mom married Mr. Rogers(funny!).  But the criminal has a tragic side too: he comes from a physically and emotionally abusive home, which he reveals in one scene when he pulls up his shirt sleeve and reveals a cigar burn on his arm.  The others have similar problems: The loner is grossly neglected; the intellectual feels like he has to contantly impress his parents; the athelete has issues with his father, whom has a negative attitude about what he considers \\"weakness\\"; and the prep struggles with peer pressure put on by her particular \\"click\\".  In the end, they become friends,and the movie ended with the intellectual saying: 'dear Mr. Vernan, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice an entire saturday in detention for whatever it is we did wrong.  But we think you're crazy for you telling us to tell you who we think we are.  You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest term, in the most convenient definitions.  But what we discovered is each one of us is a brain, and an athelete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.  Does that answer your question? Sincerely, The Breakfast club.\\"    The only real complaint I had about the DVD is the lack of special features the disc had.  But the complaint is only minor.
1932100385|5.0|The China Study contributes to a new scientific understanding of health,important as the historic 19th Century beginning of understanding of infectious diseases.  Nutritional science has been  previously highly misleading. Epidemiology increasingly suggests there is something drastically wrong with our `advanced' eating patterns. To paraphrase the old Beatles' song, things are not getting better all the time. Colorectal cancer is common in all advanced countries. (He compares the Czech Republic death rate of 34 per 100,000 males, with Bangladesh 0.63 per 100,000 males). Dr T. Colin Campbell is a good scientist and makes sure of his facts. <br />In fact, he tells us, most cancers, heart disease (and all the related conditions), are preventable by plant-based nutrition. It is most definitely not \\"all in our genes\\". We are not just looking at death rates; think of the massive burdens of long years of disability and crippling expensive medical intervention. Look at the early development of atheroma in the arteries of our apparently `healthy' young people. Dr Campbell is not the only one to quote some of this evidence. Recent advances in ultrasound examination of arteries by leading-edge medical science teams are exceptionally revealing and important (check out Science Update at Berwick Heart Support). My personal story after MI 16 years ago, backs him all the way. <br /> <br />This is a huge review of evidence, including his own landmark studies. The China Study especially changed him. Quote: \\"I started at the opposite end of the spectrum: as a meat-loving dairy farmer in my personal life, and an `establishment' scientist in my professional life.\\" He is increasingly backed up by modern studies using `markers' of our bodies' response to nutritional inputs. <br /> <br />A quibble on my part, the subject of \\"calories restriction with adequate nutrition\\" is avoided in the book. Recent evidence suggests remarkably improved markers and performance and healthy hearts and arteries in persons using proper CR, and (with a reasonable quantity of monounsaturated fat) an increase in the vital HDL. Animal CR studies also suggest much reduced cancer. <br />  <br />Dr Campbell squarely faces our modern condition and our muddle. He produces some super vignette stories and masterly accounts of scientific evidence accessible to any enquiring mind. By no means all the evidence is in. Also, we are individuals. The ability to test what interventions will improve a particular person is coming along nicely, but we should not wait for this. Buy the book and do it.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious D is a strange and unique little duo with Jack Black and Kyle Gass creating a meld of classic rock sounding songs, and offensively raunchy subject matter. This acoustic guitar toting duo make their songs on this self titled album quite memorable, not for their rather catchy songs however, but for the lyrical content. Any other comedic duo would probably fail and fail miserably, but there is something in Jack Black's delivery and oblivious obscenity that makes this album down right hilarious.<br /><br />In this 21 track album, there are 14 actual songs and 7 skits. I usually think skits and interludes just bring an album down and needlessly drag it out, but in this case the skits are just as funny as the songs, and most of them lead into the subject matter of the next song. My personal favorite being Jack Black talking about his ingenious discovery of inward singing to the unimpressed Kyle Gass. The only single I've heard from this album is a song called \\"F*ck Her Gently,\\" and believe it or not was actually played on the radio, but not without some perfuse editing of course. This collection of songs range in subject matter from the greatest song ever written, the retirement of Dio, to some nonsensical ditty about a friend named Lee. This album moves along rather quickly, with songs ranging from one and a half to four minutes long, making a total running time of 50 minutes. The only exception is the last song, \\"City Hall\\" which has a running time of nine minutes and basically deals with the rise and fall of an empire. There is about a minute and a half of dead space at the end which leads into a little song that sounds like it was created in the 40 seconds it took to record it.<br /><br />All in all this is quite an amusing listen, with some rather talented musicians, but if you are looking for a straight forward rock album you might be turned off by the humor. If by chance you are up for some cleverly obscene humor, this could be the perfect musical/comedic outlet for you to sing along to. Who knows... you just might figure out what you're going to do for the rest of your days: \\"get yourself an oversized guitar, gain 40 pounds and be the next D!\\"to sing along to. Who knows... you just might figure out what you're going to do for the rest of your days: \\"get yourself an oversized guitar, gain 40 pounds and be the next D!\\"
B00005JO1P|5.0|WOW WHAT A FANTASTIC,AMAZING,BRILLIANT,SPEACHLESS film. its absoulutely amazing. you just have to see this film know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|this movie is INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL. ralph fiennes is just UNBELIEVABLE. and the rest of the cast, too, is AMAZING. the plotline itself is beautiful and passionate. each second of the three-hour movie was pleasant (i didn't even believe that was possible before. out of africa, for example, was torture). if you're looking for an experience rather than just a movie, this film will do that. the cast and story provide that. it's still playing in my head. it has changed me, even if a little. every great piece of art has that effect.
B000022TSW|5.0|South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut is mostly a  movie about standing up for ourself and learning why swearing is bad. Unforuatly, the movie broke the world record of most swearing in a movie, which was 399 swear words so kids cant watch it and learn the moral to the story. South Park is not one of the movies that can be treated as a family movie even though the story within the story is lesson for all families. If you have something that can beep out swear words it might be able to pass as a family move, but it also has some nudity, racial jokes, might hurt other peoples religion, and makes fun of Canadians.  If you get passed all of this you can see the story within the story and understand why should not swear because it creates a war between the U.S and Canada.
0385510454|2.0|This was a very frustrating book to read. It started out as a potentially good \\"action\\" book, but the action never really started. Then it became an Italian travelogue, with a hint of romance, but the romance never really started either. Then when you thought that maybe the action would finally show up, the story ended with nothing really happening. I actually looked at the authors notes at the end of the book to see if there was more to come. <br /> <br />Dont't waste your time reading this book.
B000002KOO|5.0|I\\"ve listened to all of Fleetwood Mac's blues recordings before this album while in high school. At college in my first year, I wandered by a dorm room and heard something that stopped me cold in my tracks - \\"Searching For Madge\\" was playing. Only a few times in my life have I been stopped cold by music e.g. being in SF and hearing Stevie Ray's \\"Texas Flood\\" and going What Was That?  <br /> <br />I couldn't believe it. Fleetwood Mac had moved to something else that appeared then and still does appear perfect. In particular, I love the synergy of Peter Green's guitar work with that of a 19 year old Danny Kirwin who played in more of a vibrato style - very distinct and powerful. These two guitarists (and other band members as McVie) in songs like \\"Searching for Madge\\" and \\"Fighting for Madge\\" danced among each other in the most subtle manner of synergy - an astonishing sound. If anyone remembers the \\"tightness\\" of Paul Butterfield's \\"East-West\\" in which Elvin Bishop and the great Michael Bloomfield \\"talked\\" to each other and twined in \\"East-West\\", this album has that magical component you won't find hardly anywhere among two lead guitarists. Danny Kirwin in my opinion is one of the most under-rated guitarists of all rockdom whereas Peter Green recieved all accolades instead, which he rightly deserved. Even Mick Fleetwood showed genius then (versus his later pap) in his lower-regions drumming in \\"Coming My Way\\".  Every song in this album is distinct yet it fits. 'm listening to it now and it moves me as powerfully as it did when I was a kid (\\"Before The Beginning\\" is playing); I can only say this about few musical gems.  And I will always miss Danny Kirwin who became a street person but never picked himself up like Peter Green eventualy did; these genius' had their demons - worthy of a good journalistic investigation. <br /> <br />This album moves my soul in way words can't define; as I finish these words I'm listening to the original \\"Black Magic Woman\\". Nah, FM in the the old days didn't get the acclaim they deserved and this was the best of their end before Danny Kirwin left in '72. <br /> <br />I'm giving this album (not this crappy CD recording of course) to a 22 year old friend. Let's see how she reacts to real music.
B000009HF2|4.0|This album was always considered to be the best selling live album of rock history. It really blowed my mind when I first listened to it .In this album, there are both heavy rockers and acoustic ballads, also there are lots of jams. Album opens with the rock n' roll riffing of Something's Happening and closes with 14 minutes jam of Do you Feel like We Do. It's Plain Shame, I'll give you money, Shine on(Humble pie) and Something Happening are the standout rockers in this album. Peter Frampton plays mind-blowing riffs and guitar solos in those tracks. Also there is a cover of the Rolling Stones' Jumpin' Jack Flash in which Frampton plays the riff in more slower way than the Stones but this song really rocks and Frampton's gang got a big applause from the audience. Acoustic section of the album consists of Wind of Change, which really reminds me \\"That's the Way\\" of Led Zeppelin, All I wanna be, Baby I love your way and Penny for your thoughts which are all Zeppelin-type acoustic songs except Baby I love your Way which is commercial pop, because Frampton's guitar chording is really similar to Jimmy Page. Doobie Wah, Do you feel like we do and I wanna go to the sun are the long funky jams in the album. Be careful when listening to Do you feel like we do, because Frampton's intro riff is a reminder of Blind Faith's \\"Had To Cry Today\\". My only complaint about this album is that there are few rockers when compared to the ballads and funky jams. I think there could be more Humble Pie tracks from Frampton's period. Anyway generally this is a nice live album from the 1970's and Peter Frampton is a great rock guitarist of the period along with Jimmy Page and Michael Schenker. Any fan of classic rock should own this album.
B00049QP74|5.0|Picked this up for the DVD-Audio and I am not dissapointed. I saw another review that said the songs are incomplete and are in Stereo... they're complete and in full surround sound (it needs to be selected in the Set Up menu). Sound quality is great. I don't really care about extra features like interviews and lyrics - 5 stars for being a great album and great sound quality. I've been to Mark Knopfler concerts that had much poorer sound than this disc!
B00005RYLE|5.0|I saw Evil Dead, known as Dance of the Devils (Tanz der Teufel) in Germany and banned in its uncut version to this date when I was 17 and I think it is one of the scariest horror films of all times. <br /> <br />The Book of Dead Editon is great, because it brings back some nightmares I had, this gore galore splatterfest is hilarous and so black-humoured that it can't be taken seriously by anybody, of course kids under 16 should stay away from this, there unable to understand its all good fun (except the raping scene is in poor taste). <br /> <br />Again, the cinematography is splendid, the effects are marvelous, the acting is ok and the suspense is 100%. <br /> <br />Join us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|After buying Caught in the act, I felt compelled to find and buy everything Buble and I'm glad I did! Difficult to choose a top song, but Save the last Dance really good and Feeling good did it's job on me! I'm feeling oh so good. <br />He sang another song that I think must be on his valentine's tape from Hallmark today when he was on the Today show with Matt and Katie and I enjoyed that to.

B0000DZ3EN|1.0|My wife has been raving about the movie Return to Oz for many years.  I had even listened to interviews of the Director on National Public Radio.  It seemed interesting, but sadly the film is horrible.  I would rather eat my own vomit than watch this film again.    Return to Oz is supposed to start shortly after Dorothy's return to Kansas.  After her experience in Oz, that is all she talks about and her family sends her off to a mental institution where she is to be cured.    Ultimately she escapes, with the aid of a mysterious stranger, and returns to Oz which is in chaos.  The Nome King has taken over the emerald city and has turned everyone to stone.  Dorothy must save her friends, the Lion, Tin Man and the Scare Crow from the evil Nome King.    Sadly, the film lacks all the charm and lovability of the original film.  It may indeed be closer to the Dorothy books than the original Wizard of Oz, but for a generations who grew up on the 1939 classic this is a miserable disappointment.    This film is on par with the other direct to video sequels Disney likes to produce for a quick buck and it shows.  From the lackluster acting, second rate set design, and meandering story line this film is a disappointment on every level.
B000001FQQ|3.0|While KISS no doubt thrilled its fans in the first decade of its inception with a string of classic albums, the 1980s was more of a mixed-bag. Much of the KISS ARMY was less than thrilled with the groups 80s output. While every album since their comeback record \\"Lick it up\\" (1983) had gone platinum, many felt the band was heading in the wrong direction (for the second time) with such albums as \\"Asylum\\" (1985) and the synth-heavy \\"Crazy Night\\" (1987).  Wanting to reclaim their thrown and please longtime fans, Gene Simmons, (bass, vocals) Paul Stanley, (vocals, guitar) Eric Carr, (drums) and Bruce Kullick (guitar)  went into the studio to record a back-to-the-basics, return to the roots, unadulterated rock album in the summer of 1989.  Produced by Simmons and Stanley, November of 1989 saw the release of \\"Hot in the Shade.\\"<br /><br />Just by listening to this album, you know that KISS's heart was in the right place.  The band sounds like they really want to redeem themselves after a decade of following trends and a half-decade of coasting on cruise control (although they did have many memorable albums). The production is top-notch and the band gives a tight, focused execution of the songs. So \\"Hot in the Shade\\" should have been a glorious return to form, right? So what's the problem? Unfortunately, with all that KISS had going for them, the album is just a little better than average. Not bad, not mediocre, but not great either. \\"Hot in the Shade\\" is a slightly better than average 80s rock album.<br /><br />There are some great songs to be found, like the hard-rocking \\"Rise to it,\\" \\"Betrayed,\\" \\"Hide Your Heart,\\" \\"Little Caesar,\\" (to which the late Eric Carr lends his vocal talent) and \\"Boomerang.\\" So when the band sounds good, they sound very good and accomplish what they set out to do. But one major flaw of the album is that it is overly long. There are just too many songs. And while most of them are effective, they are just kind of average. Apart from the aforementioned highlights, most of the other songs sound like by-the-numbers late 80s pop-metal. They sound more-or-less like Motley Crue or Skid Row leftovers or B-side material.<br /><br />The album's (and one of KISS's) biggest hit is the power-balled \\"Forever,\\" which is hand's down, the absolute WORST song the band ever recorded. Co-written by Michael Bolton, this cringe inducing generic balled is a stain and an embarrassment on the legacy of what is otherwise one of the best bands of all-time. What Watergate was to Nixon, \\"Forever\\" is to KISS.<br /><br />Outside songwriters also hurt the quality of the material. Much of the album was co-written by outsiders, thus hindering what could have been great songs. People like Desmond Child gave the band unwarranted advice in what they thought would sound good. Despite what any egg-head music critic from Rolling Stone will tell you, Stanley and Simmons are great songwriters, they didn't need help from outsiders to tell them what the songs should sound like. If the band had just followed their heart and written songs that they knew were good, \\"Hot in the Shade\\" would have been the comeback that KISS had wanted it to be. Instead crappy top-40 whores like Michael Bolton and Desmond Child were brought in which no doubt weakened the material. While the album's highlights were co-written by outsiders, Stanley and Simmons still put enough muscle in them to make them work.<br /><br />\\"Hot in the Shade\\" was a step in the right direction. But too much filler, outside writers, and the awful \\"Forever,\\" unfortunately kept KISS from making the album that they could have made.

B000BIQKXM|5.0|The boys from Ireland are back and better than ever!!!  I don't care that the songs on this new album are covers.  I think Shane and Mark with the harmonies of Nicky and Kian have surpassed Josh Groban on \\"You Raise Me Up\\".  I love all the tracks on here,especially \\"She's Back\\" and \\"Amazing\\"  All though, I do wish they had found someone other than Diana Ross for \\"When You Tell Me That You Love Me\\".  I didn't care for Ms. Ross's voice back in the 60's and it sure hasn't improved with age.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that in order to get all 12 tracks I had to buy mine from Amazon.uk. when this cd was released.  It is unfortunate that record companies think they have to have different versions (or in this case, one less song) for different parts of the world.  We all pay good money to hear our favorite artists and we should all be given the same recordings for the same price.  Now, Amazon.com offers two versions of this cd, and charge approx. $10.00 more for one more song.  WRONG!!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|The entire album, every track, rocks ! and is better than her \\"Let Go\\" debut.  Play it loud!! Music will ring in your head long after.  My favourite tracks:  - Take Me Away  - How Does It Feel -- best rock ballad on the album  - Don't Tell Me  - How Does It Feel  - My Happy Ending  - Nobody's Home -- great as a ring tone  - Who Knows -- song sung at closing of 2006 Olympics Winter games in Torino, Italy  - Fall to Pieces  - Slipped Away
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I loved Neil Young's Praire Wind album.  I particularly was stricken with profound interest and awareness by the \\"Painter<br />Song\\".  I am an artist, painter and poet but found levels of<br />meaning beyond what I expected to encounter...I think that this<br />showed what a thoughtful wonderful man he is and how deep as a<br />fine musician and fine soul.  I would like to know who he<br />wrote this in memory to.  But for me it was universal.  I have<br />written \\"The Relicts\\" project but this poem summed it up for<br />me  very well.
B000003TA4|5.0|I don't know where to start, but first of all, I would like to say that this album is not a bad album, it's an amazing rock record. Is Nevermind overrated? Perhaps it is, but it doesn't make this album sounds bad. I don't claim Nevermind to be the best rock record on earth, but it's just one of those many good classics albums in music history and it's a must own. Almost every song in here is good enough to be a hit single. <br /> <br />Nirvana is not the best rock band ever, Kurt is neither a great vocalist and guitarist and every members of the band are not the master of their instrument, but their music is revolutionary. Kurt is a great songwriter and he did popularize grunge music to the world. Although there aren't any complicated guitar solo in their songs, but Nirvana's song is so different and they got their own music style. Kurt created good music and catchy guitar riff using simpler and easier chord progression to blow the listeners away and this proof that Kurt really got the talent and potential in creating good music. <br /> <br />Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic done their job very well too. No need to say, Dave Grohl is a great drummer. His drumming was just like crazy. Krist Novoselic's bass is another to be praised. The bass doesn't just follow up to the guitar but it really plays something. His bass playing shines and stands out in almost every single song. Without Krist Novoselic's bass, Nirvana's songs wouldn't be that good. <br /> <br />The record starts with the hit single, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', the grunge anthem. This is a very powerful song and the guitar riff is very catchy. Kurt's singing is very good here. I like the part when he screams the song \\"a denial...\\" in the end of the song. The bass and drum played in this song are awesome too. This is perhaps the most famous and influencing song of Nirvana. The second song, 'In Bloom' is another fans favorite, but I just don't like this song very much. I think it's just so-so. 'Come As You Are' and 'Lithium' are much more better. 'Come As You Are' has nice guitar intro in the opening and 'Lithium' got a great chorus. 'Polly' is another great song on this album and it's an acoustic song with interesting lyric. Another acoustic song here is the last song, 'Something In The Way'. Not as good as 'Polly' but is also a good song. 'Drain You' is another personal favorite of mine. 'Territorial Pissings' is somewhat rough but I just like the style how Kurt screams the song. <br /> <br />Overall this is a good album. This record has its historical value. If you still haven't owned this then go get it right now.
1905236042|5.0|These cards are wonderful!  We heard about them from a Yoga Kids instructor and our kids love them.   <br /> <br />The pictures are memorable and make the poses clear.  The titles of the poses are all kid-friendly (Rock, Airplane, Bunny Breathing, Arrow, Tree etc.).  Each card has \\"mood\\" words that go with the pose.   <br /> <br />The children can pick two cards before school or bed, and then we do the poses together.  Or, put them in a circle and play musical poses--when the music stops, you do the pose you landed on.
B000BNI99K|5.0|One of the songs, \\"I Can't Get Started with You,\\" contains the line, \\"Tina Turner's had me for tea.\\"  Now, there's a visual. <br /> <br />I have an embarrassing memory of canoodling with a date in his orange shag-carpeted apartment while watching Rod sing \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" on TV.  Fortunately, both Rod and I have come a long way since then. <br /> <br />Love these songs so much.  Very romantic and Rod's voice is perfect   My particular favorites are \\"Smile,\\" \\"Wonderful World,\\" \\"Give Me a Kiss to Build a Dream On,\\" \\"Stardust\\" (with Eric Claptaon), \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\" (with Cher), \\"I'll Take Manhattan\\" (with Bette Midler), and \\"Baby, it's Cold Outside\\" (with Dolly Parton). <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00000DCH9|5.0|This album PIANO MAN put Billy Joel on the map, even though his COLD SPRING HARBOR album was also excellent, but didn't get very much distribution originally. Of course &quot;Piano Man&quot; is one of my favorite pop/rock tunes in the history of music, but really this whole album is superb, and there's not one bit of filler on this one. Of course &quot;The Ballad of Billy The Kid&quot; is classic Billy Joel, and the same with &quot;Captain Jack&quot;. The rest of this album isn't excellent but Very Good. Billy just couldn't do any wrong during his 70's heyday, and this was just basically the beginning of his huge success. Billy was probably the best pop/rock songwriter of the 70's, and the material on this album happens to be some of his best compositions. In short Billy flat out rocks, so rush out to your music stores and buy this gem of an album.
B00021TLDO|3.0|I liked most of the touch-ups from the original.  In fact, now that all the prequels have come out, it wouldn't mind them revamping all of the special effects and puppet work of the classic trilogy.  BUT - Greedo shooting first?  Come on, George, only the Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks rank as dumber than that.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|You'll forget all about Head after hearing this album. Korn's older stuff has allways rocked but See You on the Other Side is new and refreshing and rocks. If you don't own this album you should even if your not a Korn fan.
0307276902|3.0|From the first few pages I was sure that parts of this book are fiction; I thought this was obvious and enjoyed reading it regardless. Hello!!!  What difference does it make??!  Dentists don't just simply refuse to provide any form of anesthesia just because someone is addicted to a drug or alcohol. DUH!!! And if someone has blackouts all of the time due to their addictions, how would they remember everything in detail?  None of us does, even without the blackouts, but who cares?! If a book is good reading, it's good reading. If the publisher told Frey to claim it's strictly non-fiction, I don't understand the point. From page one, I believed that this book is fiction based on a true story and accepted it as such. Why was this made out to be such a big deal when there are other more newsworthy items??!!
B00009V8Z9|4.0|Okay to start, I'm not doubting that Gavin Degraw is quite the talented musician, but OH C'MON! I was reading reviews of people on here and I bet about 3/4 of them are girls who just watch MTV and don't know any good music besides this. For example, one person said this \\"Another plus about Gavin is that in concert he sounds just as the CD with a little more \\"umph\\" to his songs. He will change notes around, hold out notes longer in concerts, but it sounds beautiful\\" I'M PRETTY SURE THAT ALMOST EVERY ARTIST DOES THAT LIVE (well if they have talent...so I guess all you MTV girls do have something to get excited over, because almost all the music on MTV sucks except for like 1/100 songs). Again, I am not doubting this CD is quite good, it's just, he's not a god. He does have quite the good voice but he needs to bring out more talent in the music, it's just too poppy for me..I give it 3 1/2 stars
B00000AFWZ|4.0|The title of 'Nuggets: Original Artyfacts From the First Psychedelic Era, 1965 - 1968' would seem to imply that the four discs included are replete with classic acid-rock tracks.  While there are a fair share of psychedelic numbers, when one lists  this box set for sale on ebay, the genre is identified as 'garage & surf'.  There are other genre's, such as mainstream pop and country-rock that also find space on these discs, so diversity is one triumphant chord for 'Nuggets'.  The liner notes also reveal that the producers sought to cull material from the rich netherland of obscure, local releases which deserved better than they got in the highly competitive world of rock and roll in the glorious 1960's.  I believe this set scores on all counts, and in fact only errs by digging too deep into the proverbial barrel, where some deserving dregs (thought to be nuggets) should still be residing.  But even this miscalculation is forgivable, because most people will find they have a penchant for those tracks that were local to them in the late 1960's, rather than tracks that were only popular in some far off metropolis.  Also, given that there are 118 tracks offered here (almost 30 per disc, on average), this ultimate compilation could never have completely pleased anyone.  What it does do is to serve as a library, a cultural time capsule, encompassing the attitude, sound, and peculiarities of the hippie generation. <br /> <br />I categorized the 118 tracks into five groups.  The easiest group to single out were the big hits.  There are eighteen  songs, pretty much evenly divided over the four discs, that charted at least number 17 or higher nationally, nine of them in the Top Ten.  There is only one that rose to number one, and it isn't 'Louie Louie'.  It's 'Incense and Peppermints'.  Each and every one should be readily recognizable to anyone who lived through the decade and held an interest in pop music.  While most are readily attainable on less expensive compilations, some are fairly rare, such as 'Dirty Water' by the Standells, 'Little Girl' by the Syndicate of Sound, 'Let It All Hang Out' by The Hombres, and 'Journey To the Center of the Mind', perhaps the quintessential Nugget, by the Amboy Dukes. <br /> <br />Secondly, I listed songs that are definitely deserving of inclusion on these discs, but which made a far more modest impression on the pop charts of the day.  Some, such as 'Tobacco Road' by The Blues Magoos and 'Baby Please Don't Go', again by the Amboy Dukes, had no chance of chart success because they were either too lengthy (over four minutes) or too drenched in the blues.  I counted seven such tracks on discs one, and another seven on disc four, among them 'Lies' by the Knickerbockers, 'I Live In the Springtime' by The Lemon Drops (perhaps the only song on all four discs with no percussion instruments), and 'Love Gone Bad' by The Underdogs, a band near and dear to me from Grosse Pointe, Michigan.  Disc three offers 'Fight Fire' from The Golliwogs, who would soon change their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival (wait till you see John, Tom, Stu, and Cliff in their bright white fright wigs).  Scary! <br /> <br />My third category are those songs that in some way should have been better.  I was very disappointed to find that 'I Need You' by The Rationals, one of my favorite 1960's Detroit bands, was a cover of a Kinks b-side, rather than their number one hit (in Detroit) by the same name.  And while I'm at it, although The Vagrants did feature Leslie West, their version of 'Respect' takes a third place to Aretha Franklin's version, AND the version parlayed into a hit by The Rationals before either one of those artists laid a hand on it.  'Hey Joe' by The Leaves pales not only to Jimi Hendrix's version, but also to The Byrds take.  And how come we get 'I See the Light' by the Five Americans rather than 'Western Union', and 'Steppin' Out' by Paul Revere and the Raiders rather than 'Kicks' or 'Good Thing'?  Surely The Turtles strummed up better than 'Outside Chance', even though Johnny Barbata is featured on drums here.  And I could be wrong, but isn't there a sturdier version of 'Farmer John' around other than this version by The Premiers? <br /> <br />Fourth, there are some Great Finds here on Nuggets.  The ones I knew about, but that people from other parts of the country may need to discover, include 'Pushin' Too Hard' by The Seeds, 'Who Do You Love' by the Woolies (out of Lansing, Michigan), 'Open Up Your Door' by Richard and the Young Lions, and the ultimate fuzzy guitar track, the disc four closer, 'Blue's Theme' by Davie Allen and the Arrows.  I was pleasantly surprised by 'Follow Me' from Lyme (actually Warren Zevon) & Cybelle, 'You Burn Me Up and Down' by We the People (who come off sounding like the prototype for The Stooges), and 'Beg Borrow and Steal', a completely unpretentious redeux of 'Louie Louie' by The Rare Breed, featuring a great set of new lyrics.  Add to that 'Open My Eyes' by an young Todd Rundgren and his band Nazz. <br /> <br />Finally, there are those songs that were, for the most part, interesting to listen to once, but I could never imagine wanting to hear again.  Some are so bad I wonder why anyone even considered including them, such as The Mojo Men doing an awful cover of Buffalo Springfield's 'Sit Down I Think I Love You' (which wasn't even one of Buffalo Springfield's better songs).  I count 63 such tracks, more than half of the songs offered.  That's about 30 too many.  Not that they're all bad.  In fact, some, such as 'Talk Talk' by the Music Machine, and 'Laugh Laugh' by the Beau Brummels, were Top Twenty hits.  I just don't have any use for them.  Some feature star performers, in most cases prior to their heyday, such as Al Kooper and The Blues Project performing 'No Time Like the Right Time', and Sly Stone producing 'She's My Baby' for The Mojo Men.  Some songs, such as 'Optical Sound' are interesting for their experimental sounds and recordingtechniques, or again as a local interest story (for me, The Unrelated Segments were a Detroit band I was curious to check out, but their 'Story of My Life' basically sucks).  The longest stretch of weak songs occurs on disc four, with tracks eight through eighteen, excepting tracks nine and eleven, unworthy of being recycled here, in my opinion. <br /> <br />The entire 'Nuggets' package is impressively accompanied by a 95 page information booklet which is printed on heavy, glossy photo paper.  It features background on the performers and their performances, as well as photographs of some of the more interesting bands.  The four discs are ensconced in color coded jewel cases, which sit in a molded plastic frame, which sits in a heavy cardboard box, with psychedelic graphics gracing the cover.  The discs themselves are designed to be reminicent of some of the more popular, vintage labels from the era, such as Laurie Records, home of The Music Explosion, among other bands.  It is clearly a labor of love, and something any person with an interest in the music of the 1960's should take at least one look at, and for many of the tracks, more than one listen to.  Save up, buy, and enjoy.
0375759174|5.0|In Northanger Abbey, our young heroine, Catherine Moreland, is exposed to the extraordinary social structure of Bath, where Jane Austin was living when she wrote the novel.  To modern eyes the characters appear very tightly constrained in their actions, words, and even in their thoughts.  Life in Bath was an artifice of social conduct designed to showcase breeding through demonstrations of social grace.  Relatively minor infractions of these graces could, and did, bring disgrace and dishonor.  Jane Austin portrays the resulting social tension with sensitivity and accuracy.  The reader who fails to appreciate these delicate risks and the resulting precariousness of social status will also fail to follow the character development of the principal protagonists, and will find the novel dull.  A disjoined second part of the novel is set in the country, in a great and ancient manor house.  Our heroine is considerably awed by it, and never becomes comfortable as a house guest, despite the attentions of her love interest, Henry Tilney and his family.  Indeed, her imagination is so active, that this dark segment of the book reads like an Edgar Allen Poe story.  It is a side of Jane Austin which is not present in any other of her novels.  Present, as always in Jane Austin, are the wonderful descriptions of carriages, horses, liverymen, and everything relating to horse-drawn transportation.  Here the young Jane Austin shows the fascination with carriages which became a trademark of her  writing.  The ending, too, with its taunting unpredictability is a familiar feature for Austin readers, and which carries the tension straight through to the end.  Alone, this novel would not have assured Austin her legacy.  To me this novel appears to be a study for a subsequent Austin novel, Mansfield Park, which has a very similar basic plot, and where her thematic dimensionality and wordsmithing is perfected.
B000000OPZ|5.0|You must hear this record. John Sykes is one of the greatest guitarists of all time - I am not joking. He writes killer songs and the solos are outstanding. He has created a musical masterpiece with this release. His songwriting skills shine and in particular his arrangements of the songs are brilliant. These songs are destined to be played forever. You will not be musically complete until you hear this stuff.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Wow. That's the only word to describe Coldplay's latest album, X&Y. This is by far my favourite CD in my fairly extensive collection. You hear three of their songs on the radio constantly, \\"Fix You\\", \\"Talk\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\", but the great tacks only begin there. My favourite is the hidden track \\"Til Kingdom Come\\". It's melody captivates you. I definatly recommend this CD to anyone who likes at least one of their new songs ont he radio - you'll love this!
1932100385|5.0|\\"The China Study\\" is absolutely a must-read, and if you approach it with an open mind (be prepared to have much of your former nutritional \\"knowledge\\" challenged and proved wrong), it will change your life for the better.  I just finished the book and am planning to re-read it and take notes, highlight, etc.  It is THE soundest nutrition research I have ever seen, and Campbell is excellent at really exposing the ill intentions of major food lobbies in the US/world, like the dairy and cattle industries. <br /> <br />I am a firm believer than none of us are genetically destined to have cancer, or heart disease, or any of the other diseases of affluence.  You absolutely must take control of your diet and your health.  I think the American public is so fearful to hear the truth--that their current diet is literally killing them.  While an animal-diet may seem radical to some, aren't chemotherapy, bypass surgeries and lifelong insulin injections MORE radical?  Ultimately the choice is up to you.  I'm currently dealing with a loved one in chemotherapy for colon cancer, and I refuse to believe that I am genetically destined for the same.  Please read this book, and tell everyone you care about to read it as well.
B000BO0KMS|3.0|Sam Raimi's horror masterpiece is possibly my favourite of Raimi films, and horror films ever made. It's full of 80's gore, cheese, and one-liners. So when i saw it available on UMD, i just had grab a copy ASAP. <br /> <br />Picture: <br />As far as the PQ on the UMD disc, it's quite rough on the edges. We get a pretty standard transfer, complete with all the blemishes and grain seen on it's dvd counterpart. It also suffers from some nasty smearing seen on certain UMD's like Spider-man. But, apart from that,it was what I expected.  <br /> <br />3/5 <br /> <br />Sound: <br />Hmmmm.......This UMD is a strange one on the sound front. I recommend watching this movie on \\"Full Volume\\" from the start (as it's quite soft) and then turning it down when the action and chaos ramps up (it gets pretty loud towards the end...Beware!!). <br />It serves it's purpose and I still enjoyed what it had to offer. <br /> <br />3/5 <br /> <br />Extras: <br />None. <br /> <br />0/0 <br /> <br />Overall: <br />Even though it's a pretty sub-standard UMD with no extras and average PQ and Sound, i still recommend it to any fan. I've watched it over 5 times since purchase, and that ain't a bad thing.  <br /> <br />3/5 <br /> <br />Hail to the king baby!!!!! <br /> <br />-zallapo
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I remember reading Dune when I was a teenager and being blown away by it. I instantly ran out and rented the movie and boy did it suck.  Now here I am 20 years later and I thought maybe this extended edition would be better.  Maybe the years that have passed will be much kinder to this version...nope, still sucked.  I read a lot of reviews on here about David Lynch legacy garbage...I could care less about the director, Santa Claus could have directed it for all I care as long as it's faithful to the novel.  This didn't accomplish it.  Don't even get me started on \\"Toto\\" doing the music.  I expected them to break out with \\"Africa\\" at any moment.  An epic story deserves an epic soundtrack.  And Sting....ug...nuff said.  Thank God Lord Of The Rings learned from the failure of movies such as this.  If you want to see a fairly faithful copy of Dune, rent the Mini-series from Sci-Fi.  Not great but it's the closest to Dune \\"story wise\\" out there.
0812550706|5.0|Although I am not a Sci-Fi reader, I found Card's novel to be very compelling.  Written in the wanning days of the Cold War, Card ties religion, politics, and warfare, and rolls them into Ender's Game.  In particular, religious symbols are used fluently throughout the novel.  The Book of the Dead, Ender's brother and sister having the names of saints, and endless prophesies prove the use of religion by O.S. Card, whom is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
B000AP04FG|1.0|The only reason I give this movie even one star is that it may be watchable with the sound off due to the gorgeousness of both stars, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I like Brad Pitt as an actor and I admire Angelina Jolie as a person. But this movie had to have some of the worst dialogue ever written. The story was totally unbelievable and just plain dumb. The best I can describe the story is as a poor very cheap imitation of True Lies.
B000001FTJ|4.0|Not to take anything away from Tom Waits, but a lot of his experimental stuff is very reminiscent of Captain Beefheart.  I enjoy this album but I think it doesn't measure up to Captain Beefheart musically.  Highlights for me are \\"16 shells from a 30 ought 6,\\" \\"Swordfishtrombones,\\" and \\"Rainbirds.\\"  Overall, this is a solid cd worth owning if you like Captain Beefheart of if you're in the mood for something different.  If you already own this and enjoy it, the converse is true regarding Captain Beefheart.  If this is your thing, you might want to give Beefheart a try (Trout Mask Replica was one of the best albums of the 60s).
B000BTC5LW|5.0|EMI has a new \\"official\\" release now set for Sept. 18th 2006.  Don't be surprised if it is pushed into 2007.  I don't know what on earch EMI is doing but this has been their pattern.  From what I've read, THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE BAND OR MANANGEMENT!!!  This is STRICTLY EMI's fault.  So as far as the release date, I would take it with a grain of salt based on EMI's history of delay after delay, \\"official\\" release date after \\"official, confirmed\\" release dates.  So EMI gets negative stars if that was possible. <br /> <br />That said, (if the DVD is ACTUALLY released this Sept.), the DVD gets 6 stars in my book, because I've watched several other live-in-concert videos, and this one is in a league of its own.  (The PULSE VHS video was released in 1995).  Even if you're not a big fan of the Band, you will be absolutely blown away by the lighting, lasers, and special effects.  This is, in my honest opinion, the greatest live concert video by far.  I've seen The Who, The Rolling Stones, Peter Gabriel, U2, and other incredible bands live, but PULSE is simply the best.  I don't care if you're not a fan of Pink Floyd or even classic rock in general, buy it!! You won't regret it: after the first 3 songs, trust me, you will be mezmerized by the sheer size, grandeur and spectacle of the show.  You will also witness some of the most ethereal, beautiful, mystifying, breathtaking visuals, vocals and guitar playing ever recorded on video.   <br /> <br />I can't wait till it comes out!!!   <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOIF|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the most human films I have ever seen. It may seem strange to say this in the face of so much inhumanity, but what I found extraordinary about this Spielberg masterpiece is his ability to show us personal tragedy when we think there could be no greater tragedy than being confronted with evil; evil that we often perpetrate against those of our own kind. <br />I respect Spielberg's courage for wishing to present the aftermath of this Olympic massacre in the way he did. Although he took poetic license with George Jason's book, Vengeance, which inspired this film and which I have read, by including a conversation between Avner (Eric Bana) and a Palestinian in the stairs of a safeway house, I think it was important he do so in his quest to put a human face on what must be called a terrible business. <br />It is perhaps inevitable to wish for retribution, but, no matter how we look at it, retribution always exacts a price, and a very personal one, from those who must engage in it. <br />Can a man of conscience kill, even if he thinks himself justified in doing so, without remorse? I think not. We are not animals, after all, otherwise why would we have such deep respect for those, like Gandhi, or Mother Teresa who lived their lives with compassion. <br />So, why is this film important? Because it examines how someone, who could be any of us because he must do what he must do, must reconcile violence with his personal aspirations to peace of mind.  <br />Eric Bana deserves an oscar for his portrayal of a man, who because of the deep tenderess he has for his wife and infant child, appears a gentle soul, and, yet, seems capable of the kind of violence demanded by the retribution his patriotic duty imposes upon him. <br />That is what makes this film so powerful. In war, of any kind, it is all too easy to forget that we are always dealing with human beings. Munich by Steven Spielberg never lets us forget it.
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|This CD features some good songs, but contrary to what other reviewers have said here, this is no a \\"complete\\" hits cd. For one thing, it contains no songs whatsoever from her debut album, the self titled \\"Shania Twain\\". Ok, so that album wasn't as big as \\"Come on over\\" or \\"woman in me\\", but that was what first broke here into the country market. I guess that album is now considered \\"too country\\", too bad, because it was a good album and \\"What made you say that\\" still is one of her better moments, as is \\"dance with the one that brought you\\" I remember hearing those songs on country stations in the early 1990's and loved them and I feel they belong on this collection. <br /> <br />Shanias next album was more successful, \\"The Woman In Me\\", which was more pop that her debut, but she really turned pop on her next cd \\"Come on over\\", while it had country moments, The record company, at least outside of the united states, went to great depts to deny Shania was a country singer. Ok, i'm not normally one to knock country singers from having pop and rock influences, but to deny that country played any role in the music really is a slap in the face to the country fans who made it possible for this one time wannabe pop singer to break into the mainstream. While the \\"non country\\" album made shania and everyone involved a lot of money, it nevertheless gave her artistic career a blow i doubt it will ever recover. Too bad, because if she had stayed a country singer, she may well still be having hits today. She may not have made as much money though, but if i was a singer, I'd rather have a long run on the country top 40, that a quick flitter with the pop charts.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|I thought this was simply hilarious. If you like South Park and Trey Parker and Matt Stones sense of humor you will wet your pants on this one. The North Korean dictator is one of my personal favorites, \\"Hans Brixxxxx (U.N.

It is a total take off on Jerry Bruckhiemer movies in it story and how the puppets talk and act. It is also a take off on the extreme stupidity on both the right and the left wing in American politics.<br /><br />AMERICA \\"F\\" Yeah!
0790729369|5.0|From the much maligned novel of Robert James Waller, Eastwood has woven a wonderful piece of cinema rich in subtle emotions, quietly moving and ultimately uplifting. <br /> <br />  Set in 1965, Iowa, the story concerned the married Francesca (Streep) and travelling photographer Robert (Eastwood), who met briefly for four days, moved from attraction to flirtation, love then ultimately passion. The film has a strange European flavour to it, with Eastwood unhurriedly developing his characters using silence and subtlety that proved very effective. Bridges is a very moving film. <br /> <br />  In a wise move, director Eastwood focused the story on Francesca's point of view. Though voice-overs are usually frowned upon by critics, Streep does it sparingly and unintrusively. Her character is the more important one, a woman with worldly wisdom, somebody who has forgotten that time hasn't dissipate her natural elegance and grace. I take my hat off to Eastwood as director but I'm not sure as an actor. He looked too old and unattractive , one would beg the question if Francesca would really fall in love with this man for four days. Whilst Streep delivered her dialogue perfectly, Eastwood  sounded too studied and quivery. Though the chemistry is present, perhaps the film would be better if Eastwood did not wear too many hats.In fact, if he did not direct himself at all.However, I was impressed with the music he co-wrote. It perfectly captured the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of this film rested solely on the shoulders of Meryl Streep whose performance is both heartbreaking and unforgettable. She inhabited the body of Francesca effortlessly. Without her, this film would not succeed. Her performance is so beautiful. Streep is technically perfect, there isn't a flaw in her performance. All actresses at present dwindle in comparison to this woman's talent. I believe in the history of films, only two burned the brightest with true talent and artistry. Bette Davisand Meryl Streep. <br /> <br />  Mostly moving are the quiet moments that didn't need words to be uttered. Scene in the beginning of the film where she was watching her family in the dining table then looked away.Inside the bridge when Robert caught her looking at him. When Robert called her the next day to invite her to meet. Francesca inside the truck. Heartbreaking.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|In reading about the Third Reich (which I've done quite a bit, even though it's not the most pleasant subject matter), one element I noticed running through many commentaries was that of the banality of evil, referring to the strange tendency of the most ruthless Nazi functionaries to be regular people who went about their jobs the way most of the rest of us do, with little if any thought given to the massive human suffering involved.  Sadly, that's usually the way it is: evil is good at hiding.  The most morally bankrupt people-gansters, tyrants, drug lords, U.S. Senators-generally aren't raving, slobbering maniacs, but instead can often be found hiding behind nice suits and slick smiles.  So it is with Yuri Orlov, the moral vacuum at the center of Andrew Nicol's frequently inspired Lord of War.  This is some excellent political filmmaking: dark, hilarious, and unflinching, with occasional but suitably brutal depictions of violence and general depravity, all framed with Cage's matter-of-fact voice-over narration.<br /><br />This movie basically does for gunrunners what Goodfellas did for gangsters: there's no real plot per se; it just captures several extended snapshots from a life and career spent on the wrong side of the law.  All the basic elements of Martin Scorcese's classic portrayal of Henry Hill's life can be found here-the meteoric rise, the materialistic excess, the twisted characters and violent deaths, the myriad family problems-but Lord of War adds ample doses of the kind of black humor that made Dr. Strangelove and Fight Club such subversive classics.  Moreover, where the power and influence of the Mafia have subsided since the events of Goodfellas transpired, this movie makes clear that the gun trade is still very much alive and well.  As Yuri himself says late in the movie, his work may be evil, but it's a necessary evil, ensuring that business will always be good.<br /><br />Played by Nicolas Cage in the best work I've seen from him next to his dual role in Adaptation (which was some of the best acting I've ever seen from anybody, so I doubt he'll ever top it), Yuri's a friendly enough guy with a nice deadpan sense of humor, capable of compartmentalizing his life to the point where he can sell weapons to the most brutal of dictators under the rationalization that he doesn't control what they do.  Besides, while it may be a dirty job, someone's gotta do it.  Yuri basically just buys enthusiastically into the capitalist notion of getting what he can when he can, without getting caught up in the tangled web of loyalties that characterizes foreign relations.  After all, if people are going to kill each other (and they are) and someone's going to profit from it, he reasons, it might as well be him.  The early going of Lord of War follows Yuri around the world as he sells to anyone, anywhere, anytime (but not to Osama Bin Laden: back in the '80's, his checks frequently bounced).<br /><br />While Yuri himself is resolutely nonpolitical in his endeavors, the movie places his activities squarely within the changing face of world politics as the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union leaves a vacuum that Yuri's only too happy to fill.  Starting with his first sale of an Uzi in New York's heavily Ukrainian Little Odessa, Yuri quickly graduates to wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, hitting it big when his uncle sells him a mother lode of former Red Army stock.  From there it's on to Africa, becoming the arms dealer of choice for a vicious Liberian dictator and his insane son (memorably portrayed by Eamonn Walker and some guy whose name I can't remember, respectively).  Lord of War gives us a look at some of the nuts and bolts of arms dealing, focusing heavily on Yuri's efforts to stay one step ahead of driven Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke, all righteous indignation and selflessness, at least on the surface), but the movie is more a character study than anything else, examining thetraits that enable someone to profit from the enabling of war and mass murder (to the extent that the two concepts can be considered separate, anyway).  Yuri is able to succeed largely because of his unique moral flexibility, a trait that allows him to overtake former arms-dealing kingpin Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), who's hindered by his pesky habit of taking sides.  Sure, Yuri has reservations at times, but the temptation offered by a big score always outweighs the satisfaction of earning an honest buck.<br /><br />Yuri is periodically joined in his dealings by his kid brother Vitaly, who's everything Yuri isn't: wild, undisciplined, equally prone to orgiastic drug use and sex and paralyzing attacks of conscience.  As played by Jared Leto, Vitaly is the voice of sanity and conscience in a business that has no room for either, making him conspicuously less fit for the job than his brother.  Yuri also winds up with a pretty trophy wife in the form of his childhood dream girl Ava (played by Bridget Moynahan, better known in my neck of the woods as Tom Brady's girlfriend).  Since Ava's never achieved anything in her life beyond looking good, it's a rather thankless role, but Bridget does what she can in her few dramatic moments.<br /><br />I must say, some of the more critical analyses of this movie on this site have left me a bit perplexed.  Some people seem to be interpreting it as another hand-wringing \\"message movie\\" from the Hollywood left, but I don't really see too heavy-handed an agenda here beyond showing what an ugly place the world often is.  If anything, it aims to illustrate the moral bankruptcy behind the lofty claims of those who proclaim themselves patriots, freedom fighters, or other such high-minded labels.  After one of his deals leads to a massacre of Sierra Leonean civilians, Yuri muses that people say evil prevails when good men do nothing, when they should just say evil prevails.  In a world filled with bigotry, hatred, and violence, it's not that hard to see his point.ining the traits that enable someone to profit from the enabling of war and mass murder (to the extent that the two concepts can be considered separate, anyway).

B000A7S4B0|2.0|I just noticed that this cd has the Sony Digital rights. I have the other two cd's from this band, and enjoy them alot, these guys are great.  <br /> <br />But i WILL NOT buy this or any cd with Digital rights software on it. Since the fiasco Sony brought upon the world with their attempt to \\"protect\\" their music. I am all for the rights of the musicians, and i am more then happy to pay for their work, but since they hardly get any money for their work, i dont think subjecting my computer to monitoring by a billion dollar company is worth it.  <br /> <br />I'll stick to indie music, and other musicians and companies that turst their listeners. If that means i can no longer purchase music in cd form, so be it. I can always go to a show and pay my money there to see it live.   <br /> <br />DONT LET COMPAINES MONITOR WHAT YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER!!!!! It is your business what you do and what you listen to. If you allow them to do this, that is one less freedom you have just given up. <br /> <br />Have a nice day.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Initially that was so because of the empowering message it has for females, but it is also a very watchable movie.  It's entertaining and very well done.  You can really tell that the people making it put thought and effort into it, and weren't just trying to dash off a quick buck.  There's a minimum of painful, dragged-out scenes, and in general the storytelling is skillfull and economical.  The musical scenes are all fabulous, and there's something really special about Mulan's 'reflection' song. <br /> <br />The dvd itself is something I have no complaints about, though I haven't compared it to other editions.  There are some very interesting \\"the making of\\" extras, as well as an ultra-cool version of the \\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\\" song, which switches from language to language as the song progresses, yet still sounds smooth. <br /> <br />This movie has a really special place in my heart, despite not being the best of all Disney movies.  There's just a sparkling quality to it, and I don't only mean aesthetically, though it is pretty, too!
B000002LRX|5.0|Maybe I'm way too jaded to \\"wierd\\" music, but the first time I heard Angel Dust... it struck me as being way too normal. Took me a while to really get into the album, but I'll say now that it's Faith No More's second best album, after the underrated King for a Day... It has a great feel to it, if a little conventional. <br /> <br />IMO Faith No More is at its worst when they try to do heavy stuff... They're much better with experimental Jazz, off the wall stuff. Thankfully, the only mediocre tracks are \\"Caffeine\\", \\"Smaller and Smaller\\",  and \\"Crack Hitler\\", all in that vain... along with the truly awful \\"Malpractice\\". <br /> <br />That gotten out of the way, most of the rest of the album is safe synth pop, though more mature than on The Real Thing. The standouts being \\"Midlife Crisis\\", \\"Everything's Ruined\\", and \\"A small Victory\\". <br /> <br />As for the wierder stuff (there's fewer of it than on other FNM albums, barring The Real Thing), \\"RV\\" is a great diatribe into the trailer trash mindset... reminds me of something that would be playing in the background on an old scratchy record player in any such home. \\"Be Agressive\\" combines equal aspects of haunting organ, wah wah guitar, and cheerleaders, all while patton sings lyrics (by Roddy Bottum ;) about giving head. Midnight Cowboy is a smooth instrumental, something great to end the album on. <br /> <br />I'm hard pressed to call this the best Faith No More album. I think that honor still has to go to King for a Day, but Angel Dust ties for my favorite.

Those young ones who weren't around at the beginning, and I was just a \\"young one\\" at the time of action, must place themselves in the late history of Viet Nam, the raging '60's, and the hope of JFK's administration.   <br /> <br />John was ahead of his time.   <br /> <br />Check out \\"Crippled Inside\\" what a great song.

B00005JOFO|5.0|i am really just writing this review in response to mikeonyc's review. this will also include a plot giveaway so if you dont want to know what happens, dont read any further...<br /><br />did he ever realize that maybe thats not the way he died? his (jack) wife is explaining to him on the phone that he died from a tire rim hitting him in the face and bashing in his head. maybe the scene playing in ennis's head is what we see, jack getting beaten up by huge redneck texans. i think that jack probably did die the way his wife explained it. ennis is just so afraid of what people will think or do when they find out he is gay. maybe he thinks that is the only way people like him die, is by getting murdered by close minded people.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|We have always been HUGE Cream fans and this DVD did not disapoint!  These guys still have it.  Of course they don't sound like they did all those years ago -- but who does?!  Jack Bruce still has that voice, though!  It was great to hear that music new again.
0449227421|3.0|\\"The Third Twin\\" is the fourth Follet novel I have read and it is similar in plot structure and characterization with the other novels I have read - \\"Eye of the Needle,\\" \\"Hornet's Flight\\" and \\"Code to Zero.\\"   I enjoy Follett's historical story telling perspective, especially his WWII era storys.  With \\"The Third Twin,\\" we are thrust into the hot science topic of the mid to late 1990's - bioengineering and genetics research. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed the novel.  It is fast paced, readable in the face of considerable distraction, and satisfying in it's outcome.  However, I was disappointed that there was no \\"science\\" - real or imaginary in the book.  The secret government experiments that produced the eight clones is described as resulting from \\"test tube babies,\\" which in 1974, was way ahead of any other research , academic or private.  In the hands of a writer such as Michael Crichton, this acet of the story would have been fleshed out, but alas, the reader must suspend disbelief to make this story work. <br /> <br />The main protagonist - researcher Dr. Jeannie Ferammi is a bit of a superwoman, beautiful in the Follett althetic style, champion tennis player, accomplished computer programmer and a pHD in psychology researching genetics.  She makes a likable character, however, unidentifiable to this reader. <br /> <br />Her partner in the mystery, Steve Logan, is supposed to be a strait arrow, upstanding, Boy scout type to play off the \\"evil\\" twins and comes across as a servicable partner to the protagonist.  He does more than rescue our damsel in distress. <br /> <br />The main villian, Berrington Jones, Ferammi's academic mentor is protrayed mostly as a academic who is past-his-prime, waiting to cash in the buyout of the shady company that rose out of the ashes of the secret government project. <br /> <br />Overall, the plot moves quickly and there are lots of twists and turns.  Recommended to readers fans of action and suspense.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I noticed there're so many reviews here for my favorite, and want to add the one of mine. <br /> <br />Though I'm a Japanese, I think English version is much better than Japanese. Some says there is a bit misleading in English version. I agree there're some \\"differences\\", but these are not misleading. For example, in the last scene, Chihiro says \\"Deal is a deal\\" to Yubaba and receives the final test. In Japanese version, Chihiro says that she heard from Haku and understands there's some strict rule to remove a curse on her parents so she will receive the final test. That's quite different. However, I love English interpretation. If the world of English version is unified and active as art, it is natural to accept such differences. English version is the original art instance/object created from the same art \\"class\\", from that Japanese instance was created. Each instance has the different original art fulfillment. English voices by Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden and all other actresses and actors are great! I have to say I'm a little disappointed by Japanese version at this point. And I'm sorry I cannot understand French though this DVD includes French instance. <br /> <br />I'd like to call attentions that Lewis Carroll's Alice lives in Spirited Away. There is a cultural tradition in Japan that has received this great art in UK since Kenji Miyazawa expressed Alice's impact into his literature published in 1924. In 1970s and 80s, Alice was discussed enthusiastically in Japan with the relationship in tradition of UK; Shakespeare to John Lennon and with the context of cultural anthropology. I'm sure that Hayao Miyazaki had been in this cultural movement in those days in Japan. <br /> <br />I watched and enjoyed this movie more than about 50 times now, and I will still continue this experience a little more. Don't worry, that's my normal attitude to the favorite movies of DVD and video. In these experiences, I had been keeping one question in my mind. It is Chihiro's traveling scene in the mysterious train like Kenji Miyazawa's \\"Night on the Galactic Railroad\\". People in the train are all no-face except Chihiro's group. I was wondering why. There's no explanation from the author. And then, I noticed \\"No-Face\\" of Chihiro's group is the same kind as the other no-face people in the train. Then I realized that no-face people are not spirits or gods like guests in the spa house, but human. Both of the human and spirits worlds shares this train. From spirits side, human looks like shadow. Chihiro stopped changing to the shadow with the help of Haku in the first scene, by the way. And finally I discovered No-Face, an important character in this movie, is a monster and also a symbol of human. That's a wonderful art expression and message. I think I will still discover something new for me by continuing to enjoy Spirited Away. It's really a very rich movie.  <br />
0767817486|4.0|I randomly picked up a borrowed library copy of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS to test a new DVD player.  I was scarcely thinking about what film was actually in there and when the image of Brad Davis standing anxiously in line at a Turkish airport popped on the screen, I thought, \\"Oh, it's Brad Pitt (with a dye job).  Of course, I had seen MIDNIGHT EXPRESS before, so I knew better, but sometimes our subconscious makes interesting connections that our conscious minds never would. <br /> <br />If MIDNIGHT EXPRESS had been filmed in the early 90s, say, rather than the late 70s, it would have been easy to imagine Pitt taking on the role.  Whether he would have been as effective as his namesake, the late Mr Davis, strikes me as doubtful--but certainly possible.  Pitt does go for edgy roles from time to time (e.g. FIGHT CLUB).  But I guess the key difference between the two Brads is that Pitt became a break-out superstar after only a few films, whereas Davis created a bit of a splash with this one and had trouble following this success with anything nearly as memorable. (Well, there was QUERELLE--which is certainly, uh, memorable). <br /> <br />Such is the luck of the draw in Hollywood, as well as elsewhere.  Davis, of course, lived only to age 41 and died as one of the film industry's most notable AIDS casualties.  He did, actually, work steadily until shortly before his death.  But true stardom--assuming he actually sought it--eluded him, despite his talent and appeal. <br /> <br />A role like that of Billy Hayes doesn't come along all that often for a young actor, and certainly didn't any more so thirty years ago.  Relatively few young people of that era actually wound up in a Turkish prison, of course, but Billy's attempt to smuggle a moderate amount of hashhish out of Turkey was reflective of the druggie derring-do of the era.  It was,inessence, the classic crazy youthful stunt, and if Billy had pulled it off, he no doubt would have relished having an exciting foreign adventure tale to tell his friends as they turned on back in the States.  One thing's for sure, he never would have expected a life sentence in a brutal Turkish prison. <br /> <br />Screenwriter Oliver Stone and director Alan Parker evoke the era from the outset by throwing in numerous 60s-type references (the frisbee that baffles airport security; the headlines referring to Janis Joplin's death and Nixon's declaration of war on terror).  It's a very canny cinematic set-up: a naive, playful and play-acting young American falls victim to the ultimate grim \\"Establishment\\" (a labyrinthine, foreign culture--which is even less inclined to show mercy than the most conservative U.S court would be). <br /> <br />Foreign jail flicks all tend toward the Kafka-esque.  From the first day of his incarceration, Billy attempts to learn the codes and signals that will enable his survival in this proverbial hell on earth.  In an early scene, he is corralled into some kind of mug shot which actually turns out to be a kind of grotesque group shot with his captors.  They're laughing and fooling around at first, and Billy almost instinctively joins in, until one of the guards slaps the silly grin off his face.  Billy has yet to learn the code at that point.  As the perp, he's not allowed to share in the hilarity of the moment. <br /> <br />In time, he does learn to adapt better and begins to cope--until he's within 53 days of his scheduled release date for possession.  A sudden legal reversal, however, shifts his sentence to a full 30 years--for smuggling--and he is thrown into a vortex of despair.  And that's when he explodes.  As does the movie. <br /> <br />I understand that Oliver Stone actually wound up apologizing for the film's supposedly \\"anit-Turk\\" sentiment.  That's an interesting development.  And a point that can be legitimately debated.   Many years ago, I read the book, and  although I don't recall it all that well, I remember realizing that the film I had seen a few years before waslargely-maybe grossly?-fictionalized.  No one expects strict adherence to the facts from a Hollywood dramatization, but of course, when dealing with issues like ethnic bias, the slandering of entire nation, the issue of truthfulness becomes all the murkier.  We all understand screenwriters alter facts, combine personages, and streamline the timeline for dramatic purposes.  We also have little reason to doubt that a Turkish jail (at least a 1970s Turkish jail) may not have indeed been hell on earth  The question is just what circle of hell was it really?   <br /> <br />So what do you have at the end of the day,  \\"essential truths\\" or  \\"an ethnic smear campaign\\"? <br /> <br />Well, at the end of my day, I would have to say that it basically comes down to the \\"inner truths\\" playing in Billy Hayes' (the MOVIE'S Billy Hayes') own head.   Dramatically, the hatred he develops for Turkey and all things Turkish makes a certain sense.  And his worst utterances are delivered when he is in extremis certainly.  Discerning viewers will realize that it is the character speaking, not necessarily the filmmakers. <br /> <br />When it came out in 1978 MIDNIGHT EXPRESS was recent enough history that many members of its target audience could identify with Billy Hayes.  If you look at customer reviews posted in recent years on Amazon and elsewhere, you may find that many fewer people sympathize with the character today.  That says something about our own times too.  Back in the 60s and 70s,  there was a good deal of \\"that-could-have-been-MY-kid\\" sentiment.   I don't see that kind of compassion-and that's what it is--as much these days. I kind of miss it.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00001U0DP|3.0|This movie has fun, charm, and nice romance; everything except a respect for the darkness of The Holacuast. The first hour is a nice romantic starter, and is often quite pleasing. The second half, supposedly taking place in a concentration camp with Benini and his son, and about his struggle to regain his love, is obsurd, and makes a mockery of one of the worst periods of human exsistance. He wants his son to think it's all a game. I undestand he's trying to shield him from the worst, but one can't wonder if he does more harm than good, and it's at this point the movie loses its credebility. And the ending is just way too sappy.  <br /> <br />This has to be one of the most overrated films around. Comedy does not override a serious tragedy when one is talking about the Holacaust. Benini's performance is one note and not particularly appealing at the end. How the Academy gave him the Oscar I can't understand. I'm so devided in halfs about this film. The first half is four stars, the second half is two. Thus my rating three stars.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0312330529|5.0|Yes, yes, yes! All the praise you read in the previous 82 reviews is absolutely justified. A lifechanging experience awaits you. Don't wait for the movie, it will probably not do justice to this incredible book. Much-anticipated movies based on great books or plays often disappoint. I wonder how the screenwriters will cram the 900-plus pages of Linbaba's most excellent adventures into a standard movie-length script, or even a four-hour epic. But the novel will not let you down. The snooty editorial reviewer who accuses Mr. Roberts of \\"purple prose\\" is probably just jealous. In any case he ought to hang his head in shame. For me as a writer it is hard to simply enjoy reading anything without analyzing the author's technique to learn from its strengths and flaws. But this novel just grabbed me and pulled me in from the first sentence to the last. This is the ultimate goal of every novelist and nobody does it better than Gregory Roberts, literary snobbery be damned. Again as a writer, I was delighted throughout with Mr. Roberts's remarkable gift to come up with new, fresh, but totally appropriate word choices. I wish I possessed a tenth of his talent. I know I am going to reread this book, like many of the other reviewers, even if I have a stack of others waiting on my desk.

B000AP2ZLC|5.0|Imagine a cross between their two best albums - the searing brutality of None So Vile and the technical onslaught of Whisper Supremacy - combined with new sounds and experiments, and you have Cryptopsy's very fine return to form Once Was Not. One of the first tech death bands I got into, they remain one of my favourite and with good reasons. Once Was Not is definately one of those reasons.<br /><br />Flo Mournier is better than ever on this album. If you thought he was impressive on previous albums then wait until you hear his performance on Once Was Not. His blast beats here are much clearer and crisper (not to mention faster) than ever yet it still sounds like a real snare (i.e. I don't think it's even been triggered). The rest of the band keep up as well - Cryptopsy have never sounded tighter. The songwriting has stepped up a notch also, being more epic and concise than ever before. The band throw in some surprises here to break up the monotony with some Spanish sounding guitars, middle eastern riffs and much clearer, tighter solos. The production is the best I've heard on a Cryptopsy album as well, heavy as anything they've ever done but still very clear.<br /><br />All in all, a fine return to form. Recommended to anyone who likes modern tech death.

B0000041DZ|5.0|Ludwig Van's piano sonatas are one of the best piano works collections that a classical music buff might be able to find around. I recently bought it and I have to say I am more than happy with it. And I really mean HAPPY. And Brendel's interpretation is one of the reasons why.<br /><br />  As a person, as well as a pianist, Alfred Brendel is not a showboater, a pyrotechnician or even a virtuoso in the conventional sense of the word, and he has never been. Widely noted for never having played Chopin's music, but one of the few very best when it comes to the piano works of Beethoven and Mozart, Brendel's genius as a pianist resides in the subtle alchemy of a perfectly weighted octave or a rest stretched an extra microsecond or two, more than any other technicality. Whether he plays Beethoven's piano sonatas, his five piano concertos, or other magnificent piano works by Mozart, Haydn or Schubert, Brendel's performances are less interpretations than true conspiracies with the composer himself. Some find his style flat and unsatisfactory. I find it brilliant.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|In the wonderfully entertaining \\"About A Boy,\\" Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" (the floppy hair, the stuttering, etc.) and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will, a wealthy, happily unemployed, commitment-phobic cad (slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\") whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the son of a somewhat suicidal mother (Toni Colette), and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly. <br /> <br />This film was based on Nick Hornby's wonderful book of the same name and retains much of the wit and touching humor. The early scenes depicting Will's \\"full,\\" but spiritually empty, life are particularly amusing, with Will dividing the day up into units of time and spending these units on \\"web-based research\\" (finding pics of supermodels with see-through tops), \\"exercise\\" (shooting pool), grooming, and the like. Grant makes his character irresponsible, but remains enormously likable throughout the film. This is important because we start to identify with him, and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality. His mannerisms-Grant's specialty, I think-are v. entertaining to watch; the selfishness, hurt, anger, recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly. The other cast members- Nicholas Hoult, Toni Colette, and Rachel Weisz - are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well. <br /> <br />The film doesn't follow the book too closely, however, but does one-up on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz) only appears for a few pages in the book, but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character, we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones, and we realize that he is growing up. Also, the movie is filled with great one-liners and sharp, witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voice-over function (Will's) very nicely; for example, in one serious scene, Will follows the ambulance to the hospital, looking rather serious, but in his voice-over he says. \\"It was all terrible, just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic.\\" The character would never say that out loud, but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is, indeed, very shallow. <br /> <br />The strength of \\"About a Boy\\" is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted; each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's self-discovery. That, along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance, and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy, make \\"About A Boy\\" one of the most delightful, entertaining, and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feel-good movie. Highly recommended, especially to Hugh Grant fans, or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation. One of my favorites. 10/10.
B0002858YS|5.0|Don't buy this CD if you are going to analyze, compare, try-to-guess-the-influence or whatever it to death!  If you have some \\"I owe my allegiance to\\" such-and-such band, or such-and-such style or period, or whatever, and can't resist trying to figure out how it fits into your version of the way \\"music\\" or \\"punk\\" or \\"rock\\" or whatever should be, then don't buy it.  On the other hand, if you just like music...all kinds of music, just put in in your player, and listen.  It's perfect.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|Got the CD, jammed all morning on the computer.  Promptly ripped to MP3 and dumped to my MP3 player.  Enjoyed it the rest of the afternoon on the go.  Great CD.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|Yeah, the Jared Leto of '30 Seconds To Mars' is the Jared Leto who starred in Fight Club and dated Lindsay Lohan. And he's not a bad singer either. He and his brother created the band '30 Seconds To Mars', a band that is wrongfully tagged with the 'Space Rock' genre just because of their name. It's actually more of a mix between techno and rock, more of an 'Art Rock' thing. It's not half bad though. <br /> <br />I first heard 'Attack' on FUSE, the same place that I discovered one of my favorite bands, 'Death Cab For Cutie'. I thought it was a pretty neat concept for a music video, and the tune reminded me of a certain band I couldn't put my finger on.(And I still don't know who it is!) 'A Beautiful Lie' shows that an actor can write a decent 'complex' song. Although it is written in 4/4, it tries to fool you into thinking it's written in something more complex, like 7/8. The lyrics are great, but the next song is even better. Yes, it's in 3/3. 'The Kill' is art rock at it's finest. The chord progression is nearly flawless. The chorus is rather depressing though. <br /> <br />'Was It A Dream' has a nice wet electric guitar hook that is hard to get out of your head. It reminds me of something Nirvana would have done if they had continued. This song is rather good, as well. One of my favorite songs, however, is 'The Fantasy'. I like the chorus lyrics: 'Do you love, do you die, do you bleed for your fantasy?' A little bit, erm, weird, but so is most of the stuff I listen to. While there are great songs like 'Savior' and 'The Story', songs like 'From Yesterday' are a bit boring. 'R-Evolve' and 'A Modern Myth' aren't half bad either. <br /> <br />    Overall, 30 Seconds To Mars' latest album isn't half bad. It's not the greatest thing ever, but it's worth a listen. If you liked their first album, go for the second; as one reviewer said, it's a change in direction. That doesn't mean it's bad though!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|If you are a Zeppelin/Plant fan at all then get this CD. It appears that Plant is reinventing himself as he grows older and this is why I give it a 5. May be his best since \\"Now and Zen\\" IMO.
B00005B36H|2.0|After the ridiculous and almost unlistenable Salival, Tool make a massive comeback, and create an album fully deserving of it's two stars! They have finally, finally, I repeat FINALLY created an original sound! After one album of being the worst cock rock band in the world (opiate) one album of being the worst grunge rock band in the world (undertow) after one album of being the worst art metal band in the world (aenima) they finally emerge with this, and become the worst experimental band in the world. It's amazing how they so consistently stay at the top of the heap when it comes to \\"worst ever\\" lists. Maybe they are geniuses after all; maybe its' all an elaborate joke, a parody on awful bands, created by the world's greatest paraodist? Imagine the hilarity they would feel in concert, with thousands of adoring fans, paying WAY too much for tickets to see their favorite bands, and it's all just one elaborate joke?! Maybe they don't take themselves as seriously as they appear to, and are only exagerating the seriousness of the heavy metal genre, similar to Spinal Tap? Maybe they're writing the worst songs in the world just to parody bad songs? Maybe, just maybe, Tool is the greatest joke band in the world. <br /> <br />Then again, maybe not. They're still a joke, though. <br /> <br />Adam Jones finally gets over his barre chord obsession to write songs with more than THREE WHOLE CHORDS! And sometimes these chords are not two frets apart. Is it possible he's learned how to PLAY the guitar in an interesting way?! It's possible, but not likely; listen to the grude, where he plays two, count em TWO guitar notes over and over, and has the gall to consider that a riff. Sure, it's in a weird time signature, and a weird rhytmn, but its not at all hard to master; I was playing that riff in ten, fifteen minutes flat.  <br /> <br />Danny Carrey is as amazing as always, and their bass player uh, keeps playing the bass. Maynard has a nice singing voice; I forogt to mention thatin my other reviews. He really can hold a tune, to the extent that tune's and melodies exist in the world of Tool.  <br /> <br />So, in this amazing world of general improvement (the production is also the finest yet for Tool, being one of the best produced albums of that year) its not at all surprising to see that the band didn't improve in the one area they desperately need to; songwriting. So while this album SOUNDS just as good as any other Tool album, the fact remains that the songs are just as bad as on the other albums. There isn't even any Hooker With A Penis or Aenima here; every song on this album is bad; every single one of them. And the last 23 minutes of the album are tribal noise mayhem followed by the only joke on the album; the call in to a talk show host about aliens and conspiracy. Waiting almost a hour and a half for a punchline is a bit much. Keep up the good work, Tool!
B000002KDS|5.0|The spring and summer of 1972 brought my 8-track to life as I played the daylights out of this masterpiece. Of course the 8 track is long gone but when I play the CD now it brings back great memories of those times. The topper was the \\"Killer\\" concert that I went to and was it ever a party!! 5 stars for Alice's best work.
B000000993|1.0|This is getting closer to the perfect album; it is a step up from Opiate, no denying. At this rate, Tool will release a three star album sometime around 2058! That's progress, right? <br /> <br />This album is better produced than Opiate. That's about it for real improvements. It's longer, which means more mediocre garbage to wade through, with Tool's first long song, Disgustipated taking up a whole side of vinyl (!!!) Not bad for a song that consists of 8 minutes of cricket noises. But enough about that lazy piece of garbage; the band wasn't even trying there. <br /> <br />Tool shows what makes them world famous; one of the most amazing drummers you'll ever hear drumming his heart out on songs with two, three chords, and bass lines that go from decent, to bass chords for the hit Sober. Mark Prindle called that the \\"worst single ever recorded\\" and while I actually think it's a highlight of the album, I also can't help but agree. It is probably the most tasteless use of minor chords I've ever heard. It sounds like the incidental music in a bad horror movie; it's that hilariously over the top. Yay for that! <br /> <br />The rest? Cock rock with hilariously awful \\"intellectual\\" lyrics; I give props to Maynard for trying to avoid heavy metal cliches, and tackle different topics. And I mean that sincerely. However, his lyrics about said topics are JUST AS STRAIGHTFORWARD as the lyrics to say, Warrant's Cherry Pie. <br /> <br />At least the songs are generally under five minutes. Yay for that. One star for amazing drumming.

B00005JLEX|5.0|If you can only afford to buy one season then to be honest I think you should buy one of the later seasons as undoubtedly more of your favourite episodes that you will want to keep playing again and again will be on them.  What you won't find on them however is the pilot the Seinfeld Chronicles which is just so fascinating to watch and see how different it is (in fact all of the first season is) to later episodes as well as to learn how it all began. Season one also is not replayed much on TV (at least this is the case in Australia) and I really didn't remember these episodes so it was like seeing fresh Seinfeld episodes in a way.<br /><br />With Episode 1 there is different theme music, it is set in a different cafe where the waitress knows George and Jerry pretty well.  Elaine is not in this one either, Jerry has a different apartment then the rest of the series, George seems to be the more confident and in control one than Jerry, Kramer has a dog and heaps of other interesting things you'll pick up.  The Special Feature Notes About Nothing are a lot better than in following series DVDs and you learn a lot more about the show such as Helen Hunt turned down the part of Elaine and that the show was not pitched as a show about nothing but in fact a show about where Comedians get their material. There are less features overall than on following series DVDs but any fan of the funniest show on TV is going to want to see these.<br /><br />You are definitely going to want to own and watch again and again later seasons but you have to at least borrow this series from the video store or library just to learn about what happened at the beginning and how it all began.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|it still scares me even though i've seen it before!!!  we got the dvd the day it was first available and i still love it!!  if you like suspense and horror, then get this!!
1573223026|3.0|I love Nick Hornby, but for some reason I didn't get the humor or reason for this book.  I had a hard time finding suicide or people contemplating suicide to be funny.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because you still see the great writing style and abilities of Hornby, but the story and plot were just unacceptable...to me.  I know that some will disagree and find this to be a greatly humurously book, but just not me.<br /><br />I also noticed a lot of use of the \\"F\\" word.  This is common in Hornby's works, but not to this degree.<br /><br />So, I'm a lot disppointed in this book and hope the next Hornby book is more like his usual!
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I've been a Knopfler fan since 1990, and for about 15 years he was my #1 favorite rock artist of all time.  I've really enjoyed his musical evolution, and have really enjoyed most of his solo stuff (which I listen to more than his Dire Straits stuff, now anyway).  I received it for Christmas 2005, and it quickly has become one of my favorite Knopfler albums.<br /><br />The first three songs are excellent \\"slow cookers\\".  Yes, \\"Boom, Like That\\" is louder than \\"5:15 A.M.\\" and \\"Sucker Row\\" - but it's still a shuffle.  \\"5:15 A.M.\\" finds Knopfler in fine voice, \\"Boom, Like That\\" is the bluesy rock we've come to expect from MK, and \\"Sucker Row\\" is quintessential solo MK - beautiful guitar, wonderful tune, and eminently singable.  All three are great stories, too.<br /><br />The title track is evocative of a beautiful sunset and finds MK channeling Gillian Welch.  \\"Everybody Pays to Play\\" is sad and gorgeous, with some noteworthy chord changes and great organ.  Most of the rest of the album is along the same lines - slow, thoughtful, flawlessly executed bluesy shuffles.  True, there's not much (if anything) that's up-tempo, but that's OK.  If you're hitting your stride with rootsy folky blues like Knopfler is now, then by all means play to it and give us quality songs that will stand the test of time.  Thinking back to \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" -- a lot of the up-tempo stuff on that album was a major disappointment to me (\\"Who's Your Baby Now\\"?  Boring.  \\"Do America\\"?  Repetitious, tedious, terrible!  \\"What It Is\\"?  It's good, but it's not a rock song that makes you stand up and take notice.)<br /><br />So, in the end, I recommend Knopfler fans to get this and give this a couple of attentive listens -- I think you'll find some songs you'll love for a long time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is an excelent artistically done album just like all of Radiohead's other albums.  If you whant to listen to repetative crap made by a \\"pretty\\" looking artist who only knows 3 chords on the guitar than dont listen.  But if you whant something that shows musical talent--progression and tension building mellodic songs that go somewhere besides in a circle this album and this band is for you.  Some Radiohead songs are more mellow and not upity but this is another reason i like them.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Truly a masterpiece. I have owned this cd for over a month and I listened to it at least once a day, yet everytime I still get something new out of this. I will not rate this song by song since that has been done already. Even if I did words cannot describe this music. Even Shakespear himself would be completly at loss trying to describe this . That being said all the great reviews this cd gets are totally warranted. As far as being a fan I am relativly new. Years ago I bought Blackwater Park. For some reason I wasnt impressed and I ended up trading it to a friend. That was a huge mistake. Just thinking about the years of opeth I missed makes me sick. As far as highlights assuming I had to pick some I would say The first couple minutes of Moonlapse Vertigo are completly spellbinding. Although that description could apply to this whole cd. Mikeal Akerfeldt Has the best singing voice I have ever heard. His screams are great to. Although when it comes to screams I generally perfer the blackmetal type to the death metal. I think I will just shut up now. Nothing else I could say will describe the greatness. Just go out and buy this at all cost. I will continue to collect everything they make, even if it is only half this good it will be great.
0440241588|1.0|This was so boring and monotonous that I couldn't finish it.  I used to await Grisham's every new release with anticipation and never waited for the paperback.  His last novels have been so substandard I thought that maybe he had a college kid write them and then just sign his name to them.<br /><br />This latest 'effort' was a tedious tromp through an Italian tourist town and a protagonist who was so boring and shallow I just didn't give a darn what happened to him - so I didn't even fihish it.  What a waste of money.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay can be assured that they will no longer be constantly referred to as a lesser version of U2 or Radiohead. With \\"X&Y,\\" Chris Martin and his mates have now delivered upon every promise made on \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head.\\" Everything you would expect from a Coldplay album is now in the fold. From the grandiose arrangements to the intensely emotional singing to the intimate lyrics, Coldplay have matured into a seamless band.<br /><br />While the music is majestic and earnest, Coldplay also harks back to the old days of progressive rockers. And say rock is kind of a misnomer, because, if anything else, Coldplay certainly does not RAWK! in the same manner that, say, U2 does. (Though \\"Speed Of Sound\\" tries hardest.) Instead, we get meditations of life, love, and the state of the human heart, and \\"Fix You\\" may be one of the best songs on the subject Coldplay has ever come up with. For \\"X&Y,\\" that does very nicely.<br /><br />That may be the sole area that Coldplay still needs to show growth. It's kind of odd that their loosest track is also the uncredited one, as \\"Till Kingdome Come\\" is lighter and breezier than anything else to be found on the CD. Be that as it may, \\"X&Y\\" is adventurous music for Coldplay (is it just me, or is the similarity to \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" from \\"2001: Space Odyssey\\" an attempt to convey the band's sense of discovery in the first notes of \\"Square One?\\"). Still, the perfect grace that carries the entirety of \\"X&Y\\" makes me already hungry for album 4.<br /><br />PS - Ok, maybe it's a conspiracy theory, but within a year we have dazzlingly good albums from progressive bands that wrap up the alphabet....Coldplay with \\"X&Y,\\" then My Morning Jacket and their wonderful \\"Z.\\" Coincidence? Is there such a thing?
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Let's be flat out about this: \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is Mariah Carey's best album since \\"Daydream\\" (1995). Yes, after a decade of works ranging from good (1998's \\"Butterfly\\" LP) to down right awful (2001's \\"Glitter\\" soundtrack/film), Mariah is now back in top form. For starters, two things about the title: (1) The \\"Mimi\\" as mentioned is \\"an alter ego of Mariah, a persona that captures Carey's true feelings and emotions\\". OK, if Gwen Stefani can have the Harajuku Girls; we have to let Matiah get away with \\"Mimi\\". (2) In case you don't know what the word \\"emancipation\\" means, she provides a defenition in the album notes. That aside, this a fantastic pop, R&B, hip-hop and even gospel album; that is because Mariah is able to preform all those different genres, and switch back and forth with ease. Her vocal range is fully displayed here as well, as she must constantly alter her vocals to fit the songs. To be honest, alot of credit most go to Jermaine Dupri also; since he produced most of the album including the four HUGE singles (three of which hit #1). Some guest appearences are made by Kanye West, two Neptunes tracks, and Darkchild. Now, those four singles which you have no doubt heard all over the radio, MTV, etc.:  - \\"It's Like That\\" B+. There isn't much depth to this pop/hip-hop track, yet it works terrificly as Mariah's \\"I\\"M BACK\\" single. It show's her being herself, warm personality and all, cheerfully enjoying making music. Jermaine Dupri has alot of fun creating quirky beats to lace with Mariah's lyrics, and Fat Man Scoop has some nice unbilled verses. This track accomplishes it exact purpose terrificly: letting us know that Mariah is on top again.  - \\"We Belong Together\\" A. Mariah has made many R&B singles over the years (\\"Always Be My Baby\\", \\"Honey\\"), but this time she achives a personal best. Her vocals fit perfectly and never seem melodramatic, thus the song always has heartfelt conviction; you can sense real heartbreak in the lyrics. The writing may seem standard at first, but note the way she incorporates re-sung elements of Bobby Womack's \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\"; it's done with ingenious songwriting. It is also interesting to see JD create a song without a single hip-hop influence. This is one of 2005's best singles.  - \\"Shake It Off\\" B. This is a perfectly good pop song that just could have been a bit more. The production is catchy, and Mariah has some nice rhyming in lyrical work, but it lacks the explosiveness that it should have. It's not the kind of song that becomes a classic, but it sounds good on the radio for a while. Afterwards you will be humming the song in your head, yet (unlike \\"It's Like That\\") you'll be uncertain as to why your humming it.  - \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" A. Just like \\"We Belong Together\\" this a terrific R&B ballad, but don't make the mistake of thinking it recycles that great tune. This is totally different with it's own heartbreaking lyrics, in which Mariah creates some beautiful images. Even Jermaine Dupri's raps towards the end of the of the song seem at place. This is one of those songs where everything just works. Fantastic conmtemorary R&B at it's best here.  As of today (2/3/06), those are the only singles from the album, but I wouldn't be surprised if atleast one more was released because there are so many more notable selections; my personal favorites being some of the hip-hop collaborations. \\"Say Somethin'\\" (feat. Snoop Dogg) has single written all over it; it's catchy, smooth, has great lyrics and a rather relaxing and (yes) sincere rap from Snoop Dogg. Nelly's contribution on \\"To The Floor' spells out a ready-made dance cut with a slick vibe to it. Both of these tracks are top examples of The Neptunes best work. \\"Your Girl\\" is a sweet, gentle pop tune that captures alot of the innocence and charm Mariah had when she first started in 1990 with \\"Vision Of Love\\". She also delves into gospel for a little bit, best heard on the deep and powerful \\"Fly Like A Bird\\"; a song which deserves comparison with her own \\"Hero\\" from 1993's \\"Musicbox\\" LP. Other notable listens are the Mariah & JD light, joyous club anthem \\"Get Your Number\\" and the Twista collaboration \\"So Lonely (One & Only Part II)\\"; with it's seductive pulse from Darchild's production. The rest of the material flows perfectly in between all these tunes. The only downside comes at the end with an unnessecary Remix of \\"We Belong Together\\"; Jadakiss & Styles P.'s raps really detract from the depth of the song, but since everything before has been flawless, we can easily overlook it.  Bottom Line: ****. This is not only some of Mariah Carey's best work ever, it's also one of the best comtemporary R&B albums ever recorded; one that deserve's comparison with Sisqo's \\"Unleash The Dragon\\", Beyonce's \\"Dangerously In Love\\" and Usher's \\"Confessions\\". Everything about this album works; the induvidual parts are equal to the whole creating a total delight right from the first note of \\"It's Like That\\". It may have taken a few years, but Mimi Carey is finally back on top; and reminding us why she's one of the greatest female artists in history.   NOTE: \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"Makin' It Last All Night (what It Do\\" (feat. Jermaine Dupri), \\"So Lonely (One & Only Part II)\\" (feat. Twista) and \\"We Belong Together\\" (Remix feat. Jadakiss and Styles P.) are only available on the Ultra-Platinum Edition of the album. The edition is also available with a DVD, which includes the videos for \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake It Off\\" and the never-before-seen \\"Get your Number\\" video, along with interviews with Mariah.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I'm not a sci-fi nut so let's be realistic, okay?, and be objective. This is a good series, but not great. FIREFLY doesn't deserve one hundred percent five-star ratings, guys. Okay? I mean REALLY. For one thing, the characters are still using shotguns five hundred years from now. How lame is that? Plus the series comes off as a kind of western oater with spacecraft. I mean, the guys on the show dress like nineteeth century cavalry troopers, with the riding boots, pants with the stripe up the side, and the suspenders, instead of 24th century types. And frankly some of the scenes look suspiciously like cheapo backlot studio sets rejected from grade B western flicks. (Hey, quit throwing rocks, you fanatics! Note that I give FIREFLY four-stars. OKAY?) Let me say I like this series because of its clever and witty dialogue, hot chicks and studley heros, and the relationships between the crew. (Will the captain ever confess his love for the \\"whore\\"? Will the flight engineer and the doctor get together?) I like the ugly spaceship, Serenity, which looks like a giant june bug with rotating Harrier jet pods and a drop-down loading ramp. I like the characters, especially the foxy prositute and the business-only captain. These actors somehow should be in movies somewhere, they are that good looking and that talented, but for the life of me, I can't rememeber seeing them elsewhere. FIREFLY at times is pure western soap with shoot-outs on horse back and bar brawls, but, uh, WHO CARES? It's so well done. Elements have obviously been borrowed from ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER and western flicks, and at times it is both corny and sexy, but what really saves FIREFLY and propells it out among the stars is the writing and the acting. To the objective observer, there are reasons FIREFLY as a series didn't last; it certainly could have been better with a little more imagination and creativity, but it is pretty good and a lot of fun....Whoa there, Trigger!
B000006TRV|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before... Ultimately the best album of all time, hands down.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Man, this CD is growing on me the more I listen to it!  I was a little doubtful about the Strokes when \\"Juicebox\\" first came out.  I really didn't the single at all.  Then I heard a few tracks that were floating around before the cd came out.  Still not very impressed.  Then I heard a lot of mixed reviews, and more bad ones then good ones.  Some of my friends got it when it first came out and liked it.  I trust their taste in music, so I picked it up.   <br />The first time I listened to it, it sounded so different.  I wasn't used to Julian's different vocals and I didn't really like it.  I almost wanted to hate it because everyone gave it a bad review.  That's why I hate reading reviews before I hear somthing.  Once I heard it a few times, I really started enjoying it.  The first 2 albums are great, but Julian's voice is either one extreme or another.  He is either yawning out a slow tune, or yelling out one.  Don't get me wrong, this worked on their first 2 albums, but it's been done and they need a change.  This album has so much more character.  Julian has more emotion to his voice and lyrics.  They try out different things on this album, and most of the time it works out.  There are some songs that aren't their best such as razorblade which reminds me a lot of \\"Mandy\\" by Barry Manalow.  I never really liked Juicebox because it sounded like a rip off of the old batman theme and a pixies song, but it is growing on me.   <br />There are some of my all time fave strokes songs on here: \\"You only live once\\"  sounds like a classic strokes song that you would hear on one of their first cds, but Julian has more feeling and emotion to his voice.   \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is a very beautiful song with some kind of keyboard/cello and reminds me of a lou reed classic.  My favorite would have to be \\"Evening Sun.\\"  Some classic strokes sounds to this one, but it has a very trippy feeling to it that I like more every time I hear it.  Please don't listen to the critics on this one.If you are a strokes fan, odds are you will like this one too.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I first discovered the brilliance of the Strokes one night several years ago.  I was at a friends house \\"partaking in the herb,\\" when I suddenly became aware of the music playing in the background (\\"Is This It\\").  A wave of pure enjoyment passed over me, and it was as if each of the crisp notes coming from the stereo was plucking various pleasure sensors in my brain.  I was in heaven. <br />   Despite loving the album, I gradually listened to it less and less over the years, and I never got around to getting their second.  Then, a month or two ago, I heard \\"Juicebox\\" on the radio.  I was not sure what to think of it--the chorus was melodically off-kilter (in a good way), but the verses were more aggressive-sounding than what I would have expected.  Throw on top of that all the reviews I was reading, saying that \\"Juicebox\\" was the only memorable song on the album, and I hemmed and hawed over getting the album for weeks. <br />   I finally broke down and got it a few days ago, and upon first listen I realized that everyone of those naysayers had no idea what they were talking about.  However, I didn't realize the full extent of their wrongness until that night, when I decided to take myself back to the mindset I was in when I first discovered the Strokes.   <br />   There is no way to convey the sheer brilliance of this CD, and I would have no idea where to begin trying.  There are just so many moments on this album that catch you off guard and make you think \\"Holy crap, what was that?  That was awesome--thank god they put it down on record!\\"  Like the end of \\"15 Minutes,\\" where the music travels in a sort of circular pattern, and it feels like you're caught in this loop--this really fantastic loop that I wasn't sure I ever wanted to get out of. (The whole song is amazing, actually--and with the tempo and stylistc changes, it really seemed like 15 minutes.  Fifteen really good minutes, that is.)  The next song \\"Ize of the World\\" is equally entrancing, and the two choruses of \\"-ize's\\" seem to last impossibly long (the repetition making the moment that much more intense and enthralling).   <br />   And that's just two songs.  Don't let the negative reviews dissuade you--this album is a must-have.
B000274THQ|5.0|A very pleasant surprise, Goodbye Lenin!, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a family in post-communist East Germany (the former GDR/DDR), coping with the hardships of German re-unification. <br />I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant and entertaining movie. <br />The plot and the acting are AMAZING; the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing eastern German people's every day lives and the problems they've been facing since re-unification.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature. <br />In short, Goodbye Lenin!, is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />
B00003CXDV|5.0|I watch a lot of movies.  Most good movies excel at making you feel something.  Most good comedies make you laugh.  But it's the rare comedy that can make you laugh and also make you feel so good.<br /><br />I have also been an irredeemable Trekkie (yes, Trekkie, though I did watch the later series, I am truly a child of TOS) from childhood.  It is amazing how this film walks that fine line of poking fun, yet at the same time showing enormous respect for both the series and the conventiongoing fans (of which I am an occasional one.)<br /><br />The beauty of this movie (and as I understand it, it was originally written with all the Star Trek characters in place and later revised due to all kinds of legal and logistical issues) is that the story itself, even without the reference to the original Star Trek series, is a heartwarming story of the real nature of heroes, the value of loyalty and friendship, and the power of myth.<br /><br />One of the best examples of this is in a scene later in the movie when Sir Alexander Dane (played beautifully by Alan Rickman, better known as \\"Professer Snape\\") sets aside his pride and immerses himself in his role for the good of the Thermians as he and Quillig begin the Mok Tarr (sp?) Chant of Strength together trying to open a door to save their friends.<br /><br />Really, the Thermians' child like belief in the Galaxy Quest crew and the way their faith (and that of a few dedicated earthbound fans) both redeems the actors and is rewarded in the end is as satisfying as the very best fairy tales.  It may even leave a lump in your throat!<br /><br />This movie has great effects, wonderful action, spot-on acting, loads of laugh-out-loud moments.  It is simply fun from front to back.  They don't usually give academy awards to these kinds of pictures, which is understandable in a way, but I would wager that there are very few award winners that will warm your heart and have you feeling as good as this one will by the end.
0316172324|5.0|This book is fun to read and thought-provoking.  Gladwell makes the point that much of what we do is necessarily based on snap judgments.  For people who understand a subject thoroughly, such quick thinking is a good thing.  For people who are ignorant of important facts, snap judgments are often very wrong indeed.  Gladwell uses the amusing example of Warren Harding, whose rise to the presidency was based on nothing more than good looks and pleasant manners.  In office Harding's ignorance led to one poor decision after another.  This sort of thing is all too prevalent today.  In my opinion, it's one of the best explanations available for the lackluster political career of George W. Bush.  An increase in ignorance is unfortunately a characteristic of our day; Bush's lack of knowledge is common among voters and politicians alike.  The result?  Believers in astrology and ghosts are everywhere.  Most people have no understanding of evolution, or even of such basic facts as the origin of the irreplaceable oil we burn daily.<br /><br />One of Gladwell's main ideas is that humans tend to overestimate our own rationality. However, he also points out that there are ways to organize society to compensate for these tendencies.  Here's to hoping we succeed.
B0009YA386|4.0|Excellent.. but it is not Joy Division (apart from the Peter Hook bass) it is Idlewild. It's so obvious... isn't it?
B00003CXA6|5.0|We bought this movie on VHS some years ago.  We live a couple of hours from Gettysburg.  When we have visitors we always try to have them see the movie before visiting the park; that way they can understand the battle and what was at stake.  We finally wore out the VHS tape and got the DVD.  The movie itself is very moving and bears up well to repeated viewing.  The music is wonderful.  The DVD has nice extras, I really enjoyed the commentary track.
B000301YY8|5.0|Ever since I saw him perform live on SNL, I have been in love with his music. This album is a must because all the songs have a certain quality that pulls you in and you won't ever want to let go. James Blunt ROCKS!!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|A great film, not to be missed. The music is wonderful and the special effects are great. In some respects, the movie is actually better than the book; it gives Arwen a bigger role, and moves the story along faster. The cast is good. Orlando Bloom especially shines as Legolas. In the books Legolas is a surprisingly minor character. Peter Jackson was clearly smart enough to see he had a real find in this actor and gave him extra screen time.<br /><br />The movie does have its faults. Am I the only one who thought the tactics used in the defense of Helm's Deep were absurd?  The whole point of a defensive wall is to give you the chance to kill the enemy before he gets over the parapet.  You don't wait until he climbs over to use your sword on him.  Maybe I know too much about how actual medieval warfare was fought.<br /><br />As to the extra shots in the DVD, the scene with Denethor in Osgiliath is so good that I simply cannot believe it was left out of the original cut.  On the other hand, with some scenes I tend to agree with the original decision not to use it.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings films do a good job of harmless escapism. They also have a more serious message. Tolkien saw firsthand as he was growing up the destruction of the English countryside. This process has now progressed to the point where there is hardly a beautiful and untouched place on the earth, only teeming humanity as our population goes up and up. Is this really what we want? Is it making us happier? Seems more like the sort of plan Saruman or Sauron would have.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I am a metal fan, and one that steers clear of most metalcore Killswitch, As I Lay Dying, and things of that sort. In fact all of it. Through one of my friends I had heard these guys were a joke, and that they sucked. He said they were just another lame metalcore wannabe metal Atreyu act. We saw the video for \\"Endless: on The Ball the other night, and it just proves never believe what you hear. This is top of the line thrash metal. Right up there with Trivium, Shadows Fall, Children of Bodom and Nevermore. The vocals are kind of your standard yell, except he sounds so differant from almost everyone else. The 7-Strings are nice, especially since they arent beat to death like most bands that use them(Korn). People need to understand the low B string is there for more techinical playing, not for idiots to tune down to an A and just punch it(Korn, Again). The drumming is very solid, as is the bass player. They could do without some of the clean vocals, because I prefer it either one way or another, except in the case of Trivium, because when he goes clean he sounds like Hetfield. Playing on Ozzfest is a plus(usually), because it gives you exposure to the posers who go to see Mudvayne. Look what it did for SF(Can you say, Grammy Nomination?). Sooner or later, the bands that deserve exposure like Unearth, SF, COB, Darkest Hour, Trivum, and Nevermore will get it. <br /> <br />Keep metal alive.
0553801503|4.0|I count myself lucky that I came late to Martin's Song of Fire & Ice series, or I would have had a bone to pick after his latest installment. Readers will be aware that, in order to expedite the publishing process for the fourth novel (about five years after the last one came out) Martin divided up what he claims was the overly hefty book into two installments, the second of which is supposedly due this fall. I have to confess that, had I waited five years for A Feast For Crows, I would feel cheated and disatisfied, and in general I wish he'd waited and published a complete, more solid installment.<br /><br />Essentially, the pacing of the novel feels like it's been changed to accommodate the decision to split the book. It feels as though, not being ready to publish the full novel but lacking material for two complete books (though, granted, I haven't read the forthcoming \\"part two\\") he added what at times feels uncomfortably like filler material. New characters are added that lack the depth and resonance of earlier characters, and I found myself almost skimming disinterestedly to get to those characters that Martin did as well if not better than his fans are accustomed to. Specifically, I found his addition of the Grey Isles chapters weak and underdeveloped, as he broke the section into three characters who weren't flushed out enough for us to care, though in the end he managed to make the addition relevant to the greater story. Likewise, the segments in Dorne weren't given quite enough development to resonate as much as they could, though this is an intriguing new story line and a welcome addition of a new female character, Arianne.<br /><br />Fans of Danaerys, Jon Snow, Bran, and Tyrion will be disappointed, for they are absent from this book (but will be the focus of the next edition). Likewise, Arya and Sansa's treatments are a bit weaker and more peripheral than in earlier volumes. I found this especially disappointing, because although they aren't advancing the plot as some reviewers have mentioned, I found them both to be in critical stages of their character development. In all, the book's character-driven plot does not seem as tight or balanced as the first three volumes. The pacing lags a bit in the middle, but does clean up very nicely towards the end and I was grateful to regain my sense of suspense and excitement as the closing chapters propelled the halting storyline forward and made me eager for the next volume. I must keep in mind, however, that this will be a treatment of the characters absent from A Feast For Crows and I I wonder if I'll be equally frustrated with the second volume's notable absenses (Jaime and Cersei in particular).<br /><br />A minor note: Martin has always treated sexuality fankly and at times explicitly, and in past volumes this has never been a problem for me. In A Feast For Crows, the intimate scenes are more rare but the language is a bit cruder, and I did weary of hearing the size and color of every nipple described in detail. However, I didn't take as much offense to this as other reviewers have, and did not find the \\"explicit lesbian sex\\" to be any more so than the heterosexual scenes in his past books, nor did I notice what one reviewer has called \\"pedophilia.\\"<br /><br />Now on to what the novel does do well. Jaime's character development continues to fascinate and intrigue, Cersei's gradual decay due to paranoia and selfishness is done well and with Martin's traditionally excellent characterization. I found Brienne's chapters to be a welcome addition (unlike some), and her relationship with Jaime is one that I look forward to playing out in the future, particularly given the...sensitive nature of Brienne's position at the end of the novel (no spoilers, see?!). The over-arching plot did not advance as significantly as it has in earlier novels, but the ending was particularly rewarding with several exciting cliffhangers that indicate major changes in the near future. Martin's writing continues to be excellent, with naturally-paced dialogue and well-paced, graceful prose. His world continues to expand and coalesce, becoming more fascinating and real with each new volume of the series. In spite of a number of different characters and cultures, Martin manages to keep them unique and realistic without becoming cliche' or unbelievable.<br /><br />Essentially, Martin continues to do what he's always done well; tell an excellent story with diverse and intricate characters. The faults in this book are due more to a bad publishing decision than any flaw in the story, and when someone is telling a story as grandiose and multi-faceted as his, it's understandable that mistakes can be made with regards to the best way to proceed. I would recommend that, when picking up A Feast For Crows, you do so with these caveats in mind and allow yourself to enjoy what is still an excellent story. It fumbles at times, and feels a bit strained under its own weight and reach, but the last several chapters bring it tightly and neatly together, and make it all worth it.<br /><br />~ Jacquelyn Gillith naturally-paced dialogue and well-paced, graceful prose.

B00005QGAT|5.0|Wow, I can remember where I was the first time I heard   this album because it was that pivotal, not only in   his history, but in the collective pop   lexicon as well! In the late summer of 1979,   \\"Off The Wall\\", MJ's first adult solo effort hit   the world like a tsunami!   Every track on here is and was bangin'  and we were dancing our butts off to   \\"Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough\\", \\"Rock With You\\",   \\"Working Day & Night\\", \\"Get On The Floor\\",   the title track and \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" like   there was no tomorrow in sight!   We also were grooving on smooth  tracks like \\"Girlfreind\\", \\"I Can't Help It\\",   \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" and crying our eyes out   to \\"She's Out Of My Life\\"...    TRANSLATION: MJ had the world at his feet during this time!  I love this album even more than its follow-up   \\"Thriller\\", which was incredible in it's own right,   but \\"Off The Wall\\" was MJ before  all the weirdness, plastic surgery, scandals, etc.   and he was ours!     **06/26/09**  Well, as the world knows now, yesterday,   June 25th, 2009..MJ--Michael Joeseph Jackson--aka THE KING OF POP,   passed away suddenly at the age of 50 as he was preparing for   a string of final performances in London.   The world is in mourning right now and the media, who was both   his conduit as well as his chief nemesis in the last 17 years   of his life, is now paying mad homage to this genius, this icon,   whose unprecedented career spanned 40 yrs and went across racial,   socio-economic, language and geographic barriers!   I have been listening to Michael's music for the last 48 hrs   and reminiscing over the fact that he has been a star since   I was 5 yrs old!--I remember the J5's debut on the Ed Sullivan Show   in 1969, I bought, sang and danced to all the hits down through   the years, especially loved this particular album, \\"Off The Wall\\",  because it was so good and so far ahead of the it's time!  Then, in 1982-83-and 84, \\"THRILLER\\", set new standards & broke   all kinds of records!--Then \\"Bad\\", \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"History\\"...  WOW!!--History is an understatement!!   Well, all I can say is THANK YOU MICHAEL!!  Thank you for the memories, thank you for sharing your god-given   talents with the world, thank you for leaving us with such an   amazing musical & cultural legacy!  May You Rest In Peace, Finally!       Michael Joeseph Jackson   August 29th, 1958 - June 25th, 2009
B00006RU5B|4.0|When I heard that Chris Cornell and the former members of RATM were making the band Audioslave I didn't know what to expect. Soundgarden and Rage both had diffrent sounds. One was grunge and the other was more political. Soundgarden music was pretty cool and so was Rages. And this Audioslave album isn't that bad. Some good tunes are Cochise and So me how to live. Like A Stone is another good song. I don't know but for some reason I like that song. I don't know why some people don't like it. It's good to hear something new and freash instead of the same crap they keep playing on the radio like Simple Plan or Crap Charlotte. I know for Rage fans they can't accept the fact that ZDL left. Some guy said that Tom Morello is wasting his talent in this band. So what was Tom Morello supposed to just sit around and do nothing. He's not wasting tallent he's continuing doing what he does best. And this album shows it. Coming from a guy who listens to Metallica, Ozzy and Megadeth this is a cool album. Don't listen to people who give it one star or two because they just don't know good music anymore. They probably listen to Limp Bizkit or some other crap like that.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a social misfit from a family of social misfits, a gangly, hostile, uncomfortable high school student who often looks as if he is on the verge of falling asleep.  This film presents a few days from his life.  His visiting uncle (Jon Gries) ruins what passes for his social life, his brother (Aaron Ruell) falls in love on-line, and Napoleon champions his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) for class president.  He kind of falls in love and has a small triumph at the end.  This is a very odd film, with the entire cast delivering deadpan performances that contribute to the general weirdness.  It is often very funny, with Heder giving a truly memorable performance.
0393312836|4.0|The first 10's of pages reading this book, is, without a doubt, going to be a slight challenge for the reader, because most of it is written in a completely different language; in the form of English, not quite actually, more like German-English, and is known by the rambunctious teens and protagonists of this tale, A Clockwork Orange, taking place in the unleading future, as 'nadsat' talk. Or in other words, since 'nadsat' means 'teen', it would mean, 'teen' talk, the way the teenagers, in the supposed future, talk. And it's not anything normal, I can tell you now. To help you out a little, when the time comes if you ever read it, I will give you the definitions of some words the characters often use in A Clockwork Orange, so you won't become utterly confused. <br />Many, many other reviewers have already stated the plot and other main parts of the book, so I see no purpose or no vindication or no positive results in doing so; it would only be redundant and a big, fat waste of my time, and your time. So let's just stick to the language of a Clockwork Orange. Nadsat talk 101. <br /> <br />\\"mesto\\" means place <br />\\"tolchock\\" means to punch <br />\\"gulliver\\" means head <br />\\"horrorshow\\" means good or well <br />\\"lewdies\\" is people <br />\\"millicents\\" is police <br />\\"ptitsa\\" is bird <br />\\"pee and em\\" means pop and ma(how Alex, the protagonist, refers to his mother and father by) <br />\\"grahzny bratchny\\" means dirty basstard <br />\\"skolliwoll\\" means school <br />\\"Bezoomny\\" means mad <br />\\"Baboochka\\" means old woman <br />\\"Bog\\" is God <br />\\"Britva\\" is razor(or how Alex refers his by: 'cut-throat britva') <br />\\"Cal\\" means sh*t <br />\\"Chelloveck\\" means fellow <br />\\"Devotchka\\" is girl <br />\\"Fagged\\" is tired <br />\\"Goloss\\" is voice <br />\\"Glazz\\" is eye <br />\\"Govoreet\\" is to speak or talk <br />\\"In-out-in-out\\" is sex <br />\\"Malchick\\" is boy <br />\\"Oddy-Knocky\\" means lonesome <br />\\"Skorry\\" is quick, quickly <br />\\"Veck\\" is guy <br />\\"Vesch\\" is thing <br />\\"Yarbles\\" isballs/testicles <br />\\"Zoobies\\" is teeth <br /> <br />And many, many more. <br />But, you don't really need that list of definitions.

B0000029GA|5.0|this is when nas was known as nasty nas,he recorded this album in '92 and it took him 2 years to record it and it came out in '94.thats how you make classics,ladies and gentlemen,don't rush when u make albums,the first song i heard from nas was the world is yours,one of my favorite nas songs of all time,i first heard it when i was 7 in '94,the lyrics,the story-telling,this album gives you that cinematic feel to it,when he raps u can actually picture what he's talkin about,when you think about it this is a dark album,and how many rappers do u know that came out with an album and then that same year he gets an illest lyricist of the year award?not that many,and another thing about this album is that you can listen to it without skipping a track thats how hot this album is,my only complain is that it's only 10 tracks but thats okay because nas can do that he's ill like that.all the songs are standouts even the intro is hot,but my favorite songs are ny state of mind (produced by dj premier,one of the best beats he made),life's a bitch (produced by l.e.s.,featuring az his first rap appearance),the world is yours (produced by pete rock,one of the best beats he made),halftime (produced by large professor aka extra p,this was nas's first single and it was featured in the zebrahead soundtrack),represent (produced by dj premier,another crazy beat he made),and the last but not least it ain't hard to tell (produced by large professor).this album is recommended for real authentic hip hop fans.  <br /> <br />p.s. another good thing about this album is that there's not a lot of features on this album,which is good because there are times when the featured artist outshines the artist on their own album,which is not a good look. peace.
B000002I25|5.0|You might be surprised to find that only eight of the eleven songs on The Doors were written by Jim Morrison. \\"Light My Fire\\" was written mostly by Robby Krieger (a song that Morrison learned to hate by the way), \\"Back Door Man\\" was written by the blues king Willie Dixon, and \\"Alabama Song\\" was a Weill/Brecht composition. Which leaves the other eight masterful songs. Everything great about the Doors is on this album. Psychedelia (\\"Break On Through\\", \\"Soul Kitchen\\", \\"The End\\"), rock (\\"Twentieth Century Fox\\", \\"Take It As It Comes\\"), pop (\\"Light My Fire\\", \\"I Looked At You\\") and even balladry of a sort (\\"The Crystal Ship\\") are all done with a confidence that no debut album has any right to. It also remains Paul Rothchild's finest production with Morrison's vocals reaching a majestic quality. But perhaps the best thing about The Doors is the teasing mystery surrounding the lyrics, especially on \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"The End\\". The underlying message of \\"Soul Kitchen\\" is learn to forget, a message that cannot be overstated. \\"The End\\" is loaded with symbolism recalling Rimbaud; \\"father, I want to kill you/mother, I want to...\\" should not be taken literally as they are pure symbolism.

0393307050|5.0|After reading all the previous long reviews of \\"Master and Commander\\" and the reviews on the full 20 novels in the 5 volume set - almost 7,000 pages - whew! - I want to keep this review short and to the point. Do NOT read this book unless you want to be swept up in the entire O'Brian naval world of the British Empire's Napoleonic Wars. Yes, they have been labeled a cult, but I find no Kool-Aid here. There is just wonderful writing and and an engrossing story with characters that literally jump off the page. <br /> <br />Okay, one other major gripe is that \\"the author uses archaic seafaring terminology\\". Hello!!! This takes place 200+ years ago. I personally enjoy the challenge of looking up new, old terms. This book provides realism not spoon fed pap for readers who do not want to think. <br /> <br />Go get this book and exercise your brain. I'm off looking for the best deal on the 5 volume, 20 novel collection.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima took me a bit by surprise. And what a pleasant one...I had once heard a song by Tool back in the early/mid 90's, something about \\"Sober\\", I figured I'd dig into it. Only to find all this criss-cross talk and to find that Tool fans were one or the either, ill-advised or just plain dilussional. Spooky. I bought this album (oops, sorry, CD) and found just what I thought beforehand, it'd be pretty daggone good. Needless to say, it's worth the bucks. Not many escape me, if I say so. I'm 44 years old, I have MD, a touch of gout and my liver is hangin' by a thread...and I'll be damned if I die before Spring. This is very, very good music, point blank and doesn't flinch like we do. Listening to it at intervals only helps...but in this case, I keep Aenima running like my fridge. Good stuff! I am forever indebted to whoever wrote H. and at the same time, I am pretty pissed at Harry Manback. Live and die by it. Just brilliant. Whole-brained, one in a million. I wish I could be of more help with anyone undecided. The whole thing starts off real nice with 2 sweet tracks and just gets better....I like the duality.
1563894696|3.0|A strong beginning unfortunately does not last the length of the work. There is tension at the start with who is doing the killings, but then I stopped caring. The problem was that we didn't see the mobs reacting to the killings. Sure, we saw some personal reactions from those immediately affected, but I'd expect mobilizations of the mob infrastructure, mutual protection pacts being forged and broken, the mob leaders taking steps to protect their families. None of this happens however. <br /> <br />  Instead we have cameos of the new super-villains sprinkled throughout to show the new era of crime. Sometimes they make sense, most times they don't as if they are dropped in just to add a splash of color and to say \\"Look, look, it's me, you know me I'm Poison Ivy.\\" and suddenly *poof* their plot thread is dropped. <br /> <br />  There is some strong plotting work on the domestic front of Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. Unfortunately the rest of the plotting is unable to hold together for the entire run of the 13 months. The artwork is generally good, though at times does drift way out to left-field, such as the Joker with with 100 or so very long teeth as one reviewer mentioned. Generally though it is good with effective colors used to portray moods. <br /> <br />  This should really be a tragedy, but the somewhat re-imagined Harvey Dent/Two-Face makes it less of a tragedy as the bad was, apparently, already coming out before he became Two-Face. <br /> <br /> Still it is worthwhile reading, but not a masterpiece.
0373834454|4.0|This was a quick, funny read--the secondary characters were quirky and often LOL-hilarious.  I adore the hero, the Earl of Rule, and how he's perpetually slumberous, amiable, and oh-so-polite.  The heroine was also a unique character, although there were times that I thought she was too flighty and stubborn for her own good.  I don't recall ever having read about a heroine who is a \\"hereditary\\" gambler, and it's a testament to Georgette Heyer's skill that I overcame my initial aversion to this aspect of Horry's personality.  I would recommend to this fans of the Georgian period.
B00004R95F|4.0|I bought this VDV almost 20 years after having bought and loved the record (and later CD) but I was somewhat disappointed. It has not aged that well. The cinematography is dated and the actors besides Phil Daniels are not that great. Sting is horrible...Anyway...there are soem nice moments.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I have never had the privilege to see the White Stripes live, but this was an excellent substitute. Even sitting in the comfort of my own home, I wanted to jump up and pogo with the audience. Ever hear people say they have a hole in their sound? Ha! Watch this my friend. Prepare to get a hurricane of sound thrown your way, with the energy and electricty of a lightning storm. Jack is like a mad scientist on stage, constantly tweeking, switching, improvising, concocting fantastic potions of sound. Raw, undiluted, pure- the way any performance should be. Watching this makes you wonder why other bands bother with 2 or 3 more members. I read a review of one of their performances once where the guy said how you can't believe you got your ass kicked my just two people. Exactly. If you're not already a believer, this performance should make you one.  <br />In their version of Jolene, Jack wails with the pain and intensity of someone who knows the sentiment of the song.  <br />As you watch, you begin to understand that, unlike most bands who get up on stage and showboat and puke out what's on their CD, the White Stripes get on stage to please themselves, and along the way ultimately satisfy anyone listening. As you watch, mesmerized, admiring Jack's mad genius, you can't help but scream inside yourself, \\"IT'S ALIVE!!!\\"
B00006RAKP|2.0|I really want to like this cd but the sound is awful. <br /> <br />Afwul? Surely you jest? its  clear and loud. clear is ok. LOUD is not. Music is not supposed to to charactized by it's loudness regardless of the type of music being played. <br /> <br />I mean how much bloody compressor did they use on this thing.  Everything sounds LOUD. And it's the same loudness the whole song through. Ughhh. The results of this compressor magic are no soundstage, no dyanmics, and no enjoyment. <br /> <br />The only thing this sounds \\"good\\" on are bargain basement electronics and speakers.  I pray to baby jesus that they don't start de-naturalizing the majority of albums this way. Shudder. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm being picky. But try listening to this thing on good equipment and see what i mean.
B00005614N|5.0|I don't  believe that anyone who listens to the first cut on this cd,'Duke's Place' can possibly resist immediately buying a copy;I dig Louis Armstrong singing 'Duke's Place' even more than him singing 'What a Wonderful World.'And 'Duke's Place' is just the first take by the incredible Armstrong and Ellington;these cats throw in another 16 tunes-all masterpieces.
B000301YY8|4.0|I first heard James Blunt on a rerun of SNL and he played \\"goodbye, my lover\\" (which I still think is the best song on the cd).  I liked his voice and his accompanying himself on the piano without a lot of additional instrumentation.  I was pleased to hear that many of the songs on the cd were unadorned with overproduced arrangements.  His sound, however, is not original.  He sounds like everyone from the Buckleys to Elton John to, yes, Chris Martin.  Nevertheless he emulates well and I would recommend this cd highly.
0743455967|4.0|This book was fascinating because it gave a little insight about the reality of being a writer, being a best seller, yet being human. It wasn't a book full of a lot of tips, it was more about how he became a writer, and how he writes. Sure there were tips, but that wasn't the focus (as title implies).<br /><br />I don't have much in common with Stephen King when I write, but I have enjoyed many of his novels over decades of reading. His memoir reminds us that aspiring authors can make some mistakes and still do what they enjoy.
6305657947|5.0|I love this film and still watch it about twice a year.  Pierce was born for this role (this and James Bond).  He is the perfect suave millionaire the little princesses in all of us dream about.  Normally, I'm not a Rene Russo fan, but she certainly nailed this part to the wall.  The original, to me, has nothing on this remake and I swear I'm still waiting with baited breath for a part two.  Holding on to a man like Thomas Crowne can't be easy to do...
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. This movie is meant to make a person laugh, and it is also very romantic. It's the perfect HEA where a cynical man finds a woman spunky enough to get past his gritty exterior and find the hero within. It's one of those movies with images and lines that are so easy and enjoyable to remember. These days every other time I look at the ocean I think... so lovely and so full of fish.
0792846443|3.0|First of all, when I bought this dvd from Sears for about 10 dollars, and later opened it up at home, I noticed that the CD was out of the case's grip and was jumping and moving and sliding around with the movement of my beat. In other words, the little tiny thing at the middle of the inside, that says 'push' was broken, in fact, snapped into 2, the moment I pulled it normally out of the dvd rack at the store, therefore the CD got all scratched up, but is still useable. And my case wasn't a special or 'unlucky' case either. There were about 10 or so dvd copies of 'Misery' on the rack, and I noticed that pratically everyone of the copies 'little things at the middle that read push' were snapped in two. How did I know this without even opening the cases? Well, I held it in my hands and flipped the dvd, to the front and backcovers, over and over, and could hear the CD inside, rocking and moving and banging along the sides. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to be in the grip of those crab-like pinchers if you will, to stay sustained in it's place, but it was moving and rocking about, so those crab-like pinchers were broken.  <br />Though, enough about the low-quality of the dvd cases, and those crab-like pinchers. As for the actual quailty of the movie, adaptated from Stephen King's 1987 best-selling novel, Misery, about a famous writer being hostaged by his insane 'number one-fan'-I have to give it just a 3 star rating or an average, medium rating, because honestly, I didn't feel that the movie adaptation of King's wonderful, terrifying 1987 thriller, can bring vindicating justice to it. For one, the cut scenes were terribly done. For example, there will be a scene of Annie and Paul in the same room, and then the next scene will be of Annie's farmhouse or the view of the snowy Colorado mountains, and I have to admit, no matter how much I want to stay positive and not be negative, that it looks very choppy and un-professional. Two, Annie doesn't chop off Paulslegs with an axe, and you don't get to see the blood, instead it's something much more kittier; getting both his ankles broken by sledgehammer blows. Three, the scene of Annie riding her lawnmover over one of the local deputy polices and then slaughtering him up into little bite size chunky pieces, is edited out, because Rob Reiner, the director, thought people would laugh at it so he decided to edit it out, though that's only his opinion and view on the matter so he couldn't be 100, not even 50 percent sure. If he wanted to know, I, and probably many others would have loved to see that scene of deputy lawnmowing bloodshed galore.  <br />Overall, this is an average movie, which deserves an average rating of 3 out of 5 stars. Directed averagly, casted averagly, adaptated from the novel by Stephen King averagly, priced averagly, edited and cutted averagly, scared me averagly, presentated averagly, dvd case of it, a little below averagly because of the broken 'crab-pinchers' or 'the dvd-graspers', but still giving the movie an 'average' score anyway, for like the saying goes, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\\" Overall, everything is average. If you want an average horror film, if you are an average person, this is for you I guess. <br />But if you want something much better, a better adaptated Stephen King film, a better directed, a better casted, a better edited and cutted, a more scarier, a generally more faithful and more justifying and plain better horror film(either adaptated from one of King's novels or not)I recommend \\"Carrie\\" directed by Brian De Palma(most well-known for directing the classic 1983 film about drugs, money, love, ambition, corruption, betrayal, the American dream; \\"Scarface\\")instead of the film I just ended reviewing, \\"Misery.\\"
B00005AAFS|5.0|To tell you the truth I really don't know hich I prefer Reise Reise or this album but this cd has one song that makes it stick out more than any other Rammstein cd:\\"Mein Hertz Brent\\". Not since Last Rights by Skinny Puppy opened up with \\"Love in Vein\\" have I heard such a great intro to a cd. The rest of the album is also quite good and easily one of Rammsteins best if not the best.
B00005JO1P|5.0|If you look through my review list, you'll see that I don't write movie reviews, I write book reviews.  The main reason for that is, Hollywood doesn't come up with much that I think is worth reviewing.  I would say that 90% of the movies I have watched failed to hold my interest and in the end, I usually wish I had the last 2 hours of my life back.  Last night, however, I watched WALK THE LINE and was in for a big surprise.<br /><br />I had seen the previews and it appeared that Juaquin Phoenix was able to pull off the roll of Johnny Cash, but for the life of me, I could not grasp the beautiful Reese Witherspoon pulling off the roll of the homely June Carter. Boy was I ever wrong. Phoenix exceeded my expectations.  His performance was comparable to to that of Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles in RAY, for which I believe he won best actor, and Witherspoon just blew me away with the accuracy of her performance.<br /><br />The other cast members were equally compelling.  The band members were mirror images of the Tennessee Three.  The lovely actress playing Cash's first wife had a striking resemblance to Rosanne Cash, and Mother Mabel Carter's roll could not have been portrayed better. In all, the casting for this movie was some of the best ever.<br /><br />This is a great movie and, I believe, a fairly accurate portrayal of Johnny Cash. Whether you are a fan of Cash's music or not, this movie is certainly 2 hours well spent.
0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper <br /> <br /> My Sister's Keeper, by Jodi Picoult is an amazing story. While reading, we meet Anna, a 13 year old girl who leads an unordinary life. Born in order to save her sister's life, Anna is faced with new challenges everyday. Her sister Kate, 16 years old has been battling Leukemia since her early childhood. Anna has been giving Kate everything she has ever needed in order to stay alive since the day she was born. Anna has never even once tried to put her foot down and say no, until now. The entire Fitzgerald family is in shock when they learn that Anna is going to refuse to donate her kidney. In this remarkable story of compassion and hope, we learn so much about ourselves and we are able to reflect and wonder what it would be like to be Anna, or Kate, or her parents, or even the older brother Jesse. My Sister's Keeper could be summed up as one of the greatest books of all time.  <br /> This book was extremely exciting to read. It was filled with suspenseful moments where you could not put the book down. Page after page was full of exciting details from the past and of the present. I felt like I was in the book every time I picked it up. The rooms of the Fitzgerald's house were in my head as if they were my own and I could perfectly picture the way everything else looked. The main conflict interested me a lot. I am very interested in matters such as these and families with members who have diseases or who have gone through hard things like that interest me a lot because they are inspiring on so many levels and are fascinating. The characters in the book seemed very realistic to me. It helped that the story was set in the same times that we are living in now but I think that I would have felt the same way regardless of its setting. The ending of this book was better than any other I have ever read. Although it is shocking and sad, it is unforgettable and is worth the tears. <br /> The author's voice in this book is very personal. She has very well thought out words and it is surprising how distinct all of her characters are. Each one has a personality all its own and you find yourself wondering how it can be the same woman carrying out each person. The author didn't use vocabulary in an unusual way but you do often times stumble across words you don't really recognize. One thing that I loved about the book was that instead of chapters, the author put in a few different people's view of what is going on. In this way, you get to know the characters a lot better and you really hear many different perspectives. This allows you to truly get inside the character's heads.  Dialogue was used to a minimum. Since there were only focuses on different people one at a time, the only dialogues were those that affected the one person. Everything in this book was descriptive, from the outfit Kate wore at her 5th birthday party to what kind of painkillers Anna used when she had her first operation. The author's writing was absolutely phenomenal and I look forward to reading some of the other books that she has written.  <br /> My Sister's Keeper is one of my very favorite books ever. I think that it deserves a 10 out of 10 easily. I will never ever forget it and would read it again any day. It gets a 10 out of 10 from me because it had so much meaning. It was something that I would recommend to anyone. A lot of people might shy away from this story because they know that it is sad and they probably don't want to deal with it. That is the way I felt before reading it but after I did, I would say that anyone would love it. It is true that a lot of people would cry like I did but the quality of this book and the fact that it is so touching makes up for its sadness one hundred percent!  <br /> The book that I read is truly one of a kind and it is not likely that you will ever read anything quite like it. It is such an inspiring and motivating book and after you read it, you will be glad of what you have, no matter what.It makes you take a look around and realize that you are lucky and that even if you aren't, you can get through it. I loved this book so much and I am so glad to have gotten the chance to enjoy it. It's the kind of book that, towards the end, you want to stall because you know that soon it will be over. I wish that My Sister's Keeper never had to come to an end. This book is everything it is cut out to be, and more.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I love this album. It's one of those you forget about, then when you find it again, it blows you away. This CD was passed down from my parents who had the album, and at 20 yrs old, I'm spreading the word. I reccomend this cd to anyone who likes the bluesy rock sound, plus, as another reviewer mentioned \\"Oceans of reverb.\\" I really like the live tracks as well.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I don't normally take the time to review movies, but this movie is amazing. It has everything in it you could possible ask for and none of it drags down the story at all. If you are thinking about buying this movie at all go for it. I don't think you will be disapointed. I wasn't sure what it would be like I never got to see the show or anything but I love this movie and have bought the Firefly TV Series now too, which is also really good. Hopefully this movie isn't the end of the story, hopefully there is much more to come.
B0000029DD|1.0|I am a professional musician, music teacher, and songwriter. I first Heard JB when a student of mine gave me his dvd, I was excited to hear what my student thought I would like. Was I ever dissapointed, no that doesn't even explain.  This guy is horrific.  The only positive thing to say is that he has a gifted voice.  By no means is his voice doing anything groundbreaking.  His band was lame, they reminded me of my crappy band when I was a 13 year old wanna be hippy.  His songs lack struggle to keep a grooving feel, his guitar playing is a-wall. He can't even keep it in tune and his compisitions show a total lack of writing maturity and craft.  Half of the other recordings I've heard of his are so unlistenable it's enraging.  Jeff Buckley is only recogized as a good artist by amature music listeners who are more impressed with his mellow-dramatic sissy persona than his music. I bet all his fans deep down inside are confused as to why they like him.  I bet they like myself find themselves not being able to find where the hell the beat and melody and harmony are going.  Jeff is unworthy of his praise.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Before this disc, no Cash \\"greatest hits\\" collection was ever worthy of the name because the Sun songs were never included with the Columbia songs. One could never hear the salute to the first wife (\\"I Walk the Line\\") with the salute to the second(\\"Jackson\\") or the song about prison (\\"Folsom Prison Blues\\") with the song recorded in prison (\\"A Boy Named Sue\\"). This long overdue musical merger makes this an essential document of the career of one of the true giants of American music.
B00005JOFO|4.0|In the summer of 1963, ranch hand Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet and fall in love while working in isolation on Brokeback Mountain. At summer's end, Ennis marries his fiancee Alma (Michelle Williams), while Jack goes back to the rodeo. Four years later, after his own marriage to Lureen (Anne Hathaway), and both men have children, Jack initiates a reunion. The twenty-year secret relationship between the two men has shattering consequences for their marriages and lives... Simply put, this is a love story. For those worried about seeing a gay-themed film, rest assured that there is nothing sordid nor confronting about the depiction of the physical relationship (much to the disappointment of the Religious Right who've tried to demonize this film as a Trojan horse for mainstreaming \\"deviant\\" porn). Rather, the whole thing is done with such subtlety and dignity that you cannot help but feel for Jack and Ennis, irrespective of your own orientation. Heath Ledger is especially good, giving a performance that's astonishing for the way it communicates so much with so little. The film is worth seeing for him alone.<br /><br />My only criticism is the pacing. There are long stretches of this film where very little of substance happens. Some parts are agonizingly dull. Those who've seen the film numerous times disagree, arguing that every scene, every shot, is filled with layers of symbolism and resonant meaning. So perhaps this is a film you need to see several times to appreciate fully.<br /><br />The film has attracted a fair amount of predictably irate and thoughtless criticism from those cribbing their remarks from \\"The Celluloid Closet\\" and arguing that this is \\"just another one of those films\\" that characterizes all homosexual relationships as necessarily tragic and impossible. Get a grip. This isn't 2006. It's the 1960s. In Texas and Wyoming. Notwithstanding that context, from the moment Jack and Ennis connect, the possibility of some kind of life together is constantly on offer as far as Jack is concerned - all Ennis has to do is say he wants it. It's his inability to choose that possible life, rather than his desire for it, that makes this story a tragic one.of life together is constantly on offer as far as Jack is concerned - all Ennis has to do is say he wants it.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|In this album continuing the previous Mezmerize mostly everything has changed from Toxicity. The meanings in the songs are much deeper and you CANNOT just listen to the album once. You will say it's crap and not pay attention to it, but if you play the whole thing over again, you will fall in love with it. The hard metal might have disappeal at first, but if you are human, you won't want to stop the music. <br /> <br />The first half is Hard metal including Attack and Dreaming, and it continues to calm down into Lonely Day and Soldier Side <br /> <br />I swear I can't hate any of these songs because they all have different amount of power with different tone and feel. <br /> <br />Of all my albums (besides Toxicity), this is the one I can listen over and over and it won't get old! <br /> <br />Coming in short with only 12 tracks, it's to be merged with Mezmerize creating a perfect sound. Try this album out, and you WILL be impressed.
B00003CXAT|5.0|If you go back in time to 1993 and remember the awe you felt when you first saw the spectacular effects that brought us real-looking dinosaurs, you can see why JURASSIC PARK remains a marvelous film.  Although CGI has come a long way since then, you can't deny the wonder of seeing those larger than life creatures come to life in Spielberg's classic fashion.  While the storyline isn't as strong as some of Spielberg's other movies, it's still a terrific roller coaster ride of stunning action and terror scenes; once the dinosaurs get out, the fun doesn't stop.  The T-Rex attack on the cars and on the lawyer in the john; the raptors in the kitchen; the cute little somethingsaur that spits acid onto Wayne Knight's face; the grandeur of the larger brontosauruses or whatever (I'm not a dinosaur connosaur!!).  They're all still as much fun as when I saw this one thirteen years ago.  What makes the movie work so well is Spielberg's patented gift of looking at the world through child's eyes, seeing the wonder of the dinosaurs and not realizing just what the results would be.  The movie has a great cast:  Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Knight, and an early role for Samuel L. Jackson, but it's the dinosaurs who own and motivate this film.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|There are so many TV shows getting canceled regardless how good those shows are.....Firefly on FOX network was one of them.  Instead of just terminate the production, they made a future film called Serenity......<br />This movie futures none A-list movie actors what so ever.  I recognized Adam Baldwin, Nathan Fillion from 90's sitcom Two guys, a girl and Pizza Place!? but it didn't stop to make a great film here.  All characters were well developed and all actors contributed their A games to this film.  The film has little bit of everything such as Western, kung Fu, Japanese Anime, we recognized from 70's and 80's throw back space battle scenes from Star wars.  The script is very serious and intense, and yet Fillion and Baldwin delivered some what goofiness and humors.  Yes, this movie barrowed so many aspects from other type of films and yet turned into something very original.
B00097DXZS|2.0|How many times can you endure one of the guest rappers shouting out Carlos Santana is in the room or in the house?  More appropriately I think Carlos has left the building when it comes to this recording.<br /><br />All That I Am repeats too much of the formula with Supernatural and Shaman.  Supernatural was a classic recording as it adeptly merged Santana's afro-cuban rock roots with the modern touches of several hip hop artists.  More importantly most of those songs had well defined hooks.  Shaman duplicated some of the efforts from Supernatural but at least broke some new ground with songs like Sideways and the number with Julio Iglesias.<br /><br />All That I Am adds no new flavorings.  The songs are mostly forgettable.  I Am Somebody has a nice beat and Just Feel Better is fairly memorable.  Hermes has a pretty good keyboard passage and Twisted and Brown Skin Girl have their moments too.  However, after that the magic started with Supernatural seems to have disappeared.  Pass on this one.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Everyone in Oakey Oaks consider Chicken Little (Zach Braff) a loon after that day he spread panic through town. Nobody would believe his tale about aliens were going to invade Earth. <br />  <br />A year later, Chicken Little joins a baseball team to regain respect from his father. When Chicken Little wins one with an inside the park homerun, it gives you an idea of the father and son bond before the relationship torn apart. As life seem to have returned back to normal, the hexagonal space object falls from the sky and makes Chicken Little's life miserable all over again. This time he doesn't go public but instead keeps it close between his oddball friends: Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), and Fish Out of Water. They each have their own humorous personality, which shines when they stick together during the confrontation with alien invaders.  <br /> <br />Abby recommends that Mr. Little should be told that aliens really do exist, but Chicken Little holds off since there's no proof to validate the truth. Then one day his father believes in his son that aliens are real as they attack Oakey Oaks, not to claim the world Chicken Little had originally speculated but simply to search for their missing three-eye alien child and make a pit stop for gathering acorns.  <br /> <br />This Movie is cute for everybody to enjoy. Note, aliens that may appear too scary for totters could cause nightmares; therefore possible consequence should be taken into consideration.  <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Weldon has the enviable position as writer and director of this prematurely canceled television series that through the support of fans and a not to surprising amount of DVD sales, spawned a brilliantly written, directed and acted main steam movie - after the show was given the axe! Who else can claim such a phenomenon? This movie brings some of the complex sub-plots to a  place of moderate satisfaction to those of us who are devote followers, however I was very disappointed that Wash was killed by the Reavers. It also carries off its own stand alone plot well enough to capture the uninitiated's attention as well. No small feat in itself. Another endearing quality of this short series is the cast Mr. Weldon brought together. The &#34;Weldon style&#34; extended family of actors has perfect chemistry. The cast will draw you into the &#34;verse&#34; in such a way that you will believe you are part of their lives. Once you have watched go back and turn on the commentary with Joss, you will find it very different than most as Joss is refreshingly un-bloated with arrogance. If you are a sci-fi aficionado, you will be pulled into the following and will feel the undeniable pull to purchase the series release on DVD. Be a part of the family who makes their home on the Firefly class spaceship Serenity, if only for the 14 episodes. You will find yourself wishing it did not end and hoping the series would be resurrected by Sci-fi network. Judging by the 2000+ positive reviews here an Amazon it certainly appears that it would be a lucrative endeavor. Undoubtedly you will wonder what form of insanity befell FOX for them to give this jewel the death sentence. Here our out-cry! bring the series back! Or at least make us another movie.

0385424736|5.0|This novel is an underdog story of a young lawyer, Rudy Baylor, barely out of law school who goes against the big guns--that of a very corrupt insurance company defended by lawyers from a big, prestigious law firm.  You cannot help but root for Rudy, who put himself through college and law school and who is so desperate for a job in law that his job-hunting leads to a very low point: He finds work from a corrupt lawyer. However, through circumstances beyond his control, Rudy soon finds himself with his own struggling practice with a paralawyer (Grisham invention) named Deck.  Deck is an unattractive, unethical guy who does what it takes to get the job done.  He is an amusing character and rings true-to-life.  I think that most people know someone like him, or know of someone like him.  Nonetheless, in the end, I feel sorry for how things turned out for him. <br /> <br />Rudy's biggest case is the Blacks vs. Great Benefit, an oh-so-evil insurance company.  The Blacks are a senior couple with a dying son who needs a bone marrow operation that GB will not pay for.  GB preys on the poorly-educated with medical policies that don't cover much at all in reality.  <br /> <br />(*Spoiler alert*: Don't read the following stuff within the parentheses, else it may ruin one of the best moments in the book. GB's employee manuals for claims handlers and underwriters instruct the GB employee to deny every claim initially! They only pay for claims that don't cost much and/or when threatened with litigation.)   <br /> <br />I really hope that insurance companies like GB don't exist; it is merely a Pollyanna hope, I suppose.  However, if we didn't have evil companies (or evil organizations, agencies, etc.), we wouldn't have great courtroom dramas (or just plain drama).   Things are more interesting when you have conflicts involving good versus evil, or some forms of those opposing realities. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I know why Grisham is a bestselling author.  He deliversthe goods in an exceptional way.  I find myself just flowing along with his words-it's so readable.  There are parts in this particular story that aren't that believable (most of the breaks that Rudy gets in the case against GB), but somehow it doesn't diminish the excitement of the story.
B0000048CX|4.0|The genuine affection for the tunes on display here make for a fine low-key listening experience.  Covers and originals meld together in what seems to be a love letter to musical sensibilities of an earlier time.  There's a country & western, soft rockabilly, or folk vibe throughout with understated vocals and nary a hint of the experimental \\"noise\\", contrapuntal dissonance, and detached attitude for which the band is usually known.    This is an album for fans to get their arms around and embrace. Those uninitiated in the ways of Yo La Tengo would probably best be forewarned that this album is hardly indicative of the band's usual direction, but may like it nonetheless as an album to just \\"chill\\" by.
0694013889|4.0|My kids absolutely love parts of this book (she sat and sat and sat, et al) and always seem to enjoy my reading it to them.  But don't expect miracles to happen.  My kids were NOT inspired enough to start using the potty after the 100th reading. But the book is still useful to get the dialogue going and the ball-rolling when it comes to potty training.
B000002H33|5.0|Every rave you've read and heard is accurate.  It took years for any metal band to equal their accomplishment by reinventing the terms of metal anew, just like Metallica did (Soundgarden's _Louder Than Love_ did it in '89).  It then took another fifteen years for another metal band to reinvent the metal wheel effectively (2004's _Leviathan_ by Mastodon).  The only heavy bands before them who had the same epoch-changing power as this are the bands you know the names of: Hendrix, Sabbath, Zeppelin.  Yes, Metallica were never able to equal this sort of power again; this is simply on account of Cliff Burton's tragic death.  So what?  A truly timeless moment in history is captured for posterity all too rarely.  This is that fabled chimera.  Can we bring Hendrix back to life?  Was Zeppelin ever able to distill the magic of ZOSO once more?  Did Ozzy ever present that moment of paranoid creativity as well as he did on \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\"?  Did Soundgarden ever vibrate the frantic fringe in the same saturatedly scorching fashion as they did on \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\"?  No, no, no, and no.  Get over it.  This is metal in all its ugly, antisocial, frenziedly majestic glory.  You can't buy a better rock album.
B00002SWEM|5.0|In the end, Ry Cooder and 'the boys' of the Beuna Vista Social Club bask in the applause at Carnegie Hall. They found their bliss. This is a great documentary from Mr. Wenders. Cuba is an appropriate backdrop with its faded elegance, its warmhearted, island soul, its waves crashing onto the promenade.<br /><br />I don't know a word of Spanish but understood the music. This movie is about living a full life, about seeking happiness and joy, about finding your particular bliss and never letting go of it.
B000000OMB|3.0|From the reviews on this page, it seems people either adore or hate this album.  I'm somewhere in between.  When I was a youngun', this one loomed large on my radar, as it did for a horde of adolescent boys, what with its epic sounds and themes.  More importantly, it served as a gateway drug to the more serious prog bands.  I'd say that going from Asia to ELP and Belew-era King Crimson is well worth the inexpensive price of this album alone.<br /><br />The album certainly starts on a deliciously memorable note with \\"Heat of the Moment,\\" perhaps the only ballad in 10/4 time to ever top the charts.  I can never get sick of this one: Howe's mammoth guitar tone seems to encompass the world, John Wetton's vocals ooze regret and longing, Geoffrey Downes's synths bubble along sweetly, and of course Carl Palmer beats the drums silly while surrounding with you the echoes that the production adds.<br /><br />From here, it goes ever-so-gradually downhill.  The problem with this prog supergroup is that their public face, bassist/vocalist John Wetton, represents the least impressive era of his previous band's existence.  King Crimson was certainly impressive with him, but didn't have the same schizoid allure as they had with Greg Lake or Adrian Belew at the helm.  His stint with Crimson represents their poppiest in their almost forty years of existence.  Take Belew, Lake, or Jon Anderson, of Yes, say (tho' of course Asia would really be Yes with the latter) and have them singing and co-penning the songs and you wouldn't have an album that constantly flirts with vapidity.<br /><br />Which is what the album does more and more as one song heads into the next.  It's not about the musicianship, which always remains at a world-class level, it's about the tone of the compositions.  Their second single from the album, \\"Only Time Will Tell,\\" is certainly an enjoyable confection, but is just a little too sweet, making the listener think that perhaps too much of this stuff might rot the brain.  In its own way, that's fine, because this album is okay to put on once every year, much like one tends to have only have fruitcake once a year, making it enjoyable then and only then.  Compare this to a true prog masterpiece like Yes's _Close to the Edge_; the compulsion factor to listen to that one over and over again is palpable, as that confection is not whipped to a sugary froth; no, that one is shot through with dark chocolate, thick and dark with just the right amount of sugar to keep from overpowering the listener.<br /><br />Song three, \\"Sole Survivor,\\" is fun and flirts at the edge of rocking out, much like the rest of the album.  The only song that really rocks with what seems like reckless abandon is \\"Heat of the Moment,\\" where Palmer and Howe are \\"let off the leash\\" for a good time at the end (tho' of course the song fades out in the heat of the jam at the end, lest it be too long for radio).  The rest of the album is more restrained: my theory is that this is so because of Wetton's \\"English reserve.\\"  On bass, he may have the ability of a Chris Squire to cut loose and go into ozone-aiming trills and hammer-ons off the top of his head (tho' I doubt it), but he never does this.  His lyrics match this approach.  They are clever and evocative, but never hit the ecstatic pitch of abstraction and sheer nonsense that helps the lyrics of Jon Anderson and Greg Lake to put you in a completely other place.  This approach characterizes Wetton all the way back to his Crimson days.  For nine-tenths of this album, you know that you are precisely on earth, which is a little too much of the quotidian and a lot too little of the sublime for these ears.<br /><br />I could give you a blow-by-blow of the rest of the songs on this album, but I'm going to leave it up to you.  I think you should buy this album, but you've already heard the highlights if you listen to classic rock radio.  The rest of these songs are competent prog lite that serve well to put one in a slightly ornate and \\"just fine\\" kind of mood, good for cleaning the house, say.  If you're looking for a profound listening experience, though, this is not the place to go.  Go to the bands from whence the musicians here came; the pleasures that Crimson, ELP, and Yes offer in their primes are certainly not guilty ones.e in a slightly ornate and \\"just fine\\" kind of mood, good for cleaning the house, say.

B000068IEU|3.0|this film is very disturbing and bloody for the 1970's<br /><br />and still is a bit disturbing for today.the film is about 2 girls who get kidnaped,beat,raped,and much more.<br /><br />yes this film is abit disturbing but wes really wanted the people to see how killers cross the line and show no feelings in there doings.dont watch this film if sex crimes really get to you. this film has nudity,graphic violence,rape,sexualy content.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|Ugh!  Saw the film last night.  Soooooooooooo bad! <br /> <br />The acting.  The dumb story line.  The stupid bad sex acting.  Everything!  I am not quite sure what to make of the film.  Was it a low budget cheap porno showcasing cheap local easy girls?  Was it a comedy, making a parody of the horror genre?  Was it a parody of the action movie?  Or was it, as I suspect, a genuine attempt at being original yet subconsciously trying to emulate all the past films, creating in the process some horrid amalgam, which just proved a truly embarrassing brainchild?! <br /> <br />I also think that Roth has serious issues with sex and the opposite sex.  In his movies, all the sexually active women get killed off and die.  It was the formula in Cabin Fever and also in Hostel.  I think the guys' projeting his ambiguous, even ambivlent, sexual feelings and fears of women on the screen without him truly knowing it. <br /> <br />As a guy, I knid of like that the film shows that women can be evil too--because it is the truth.  And I like it when the bad guys (or women) get what's coming to them (and boy to they get it!).  But the take is too one sided I felt.  Films like the Devil's Reject also show women can be part of evil, but in both the Devil's Rejects and High Tension, there are also female heroines that fight back with the guys, showing that evil and good can exist in anyone--regardless of gender. <br /> <br />Roth, however, presents a sick twist, where men are essentially evil or just sexist animals and women just evil vile whores worthy of only mutilation.  Seriously, what did his mother do to him growing up?! <br /> <br />As for the torture scenes, it looked a bit silly to me, like they let people out of a bus filled of retarded inmates and let them have fun with power tools--that is basically the underlying drive of the graphic violent scenes.   <br /> <br />I'll admit though, you do get into the film a bit and start to cheer the only survivor who gets back at these peoplerunning the death chambers. <br /> <br />But as for real boldness or true originality in the film?  Hmm... Have to say nada on that one. <br /> <br />
B000002GBJ|5.0|From the very first time I heard \\"Catherine Howard\\" more than 30 years ago, I've always been able to picture her sad story as I listen to the various segments of what continues to be one of my favorite songs of all time.  <br /> <br />As the track begins, Catherine meets and marries her king, followed by passion and wedded bliss (0:20) as Catherine assumes the duties and perks of the Queen of England.  Later, the youthful queen dances through the castle with her entourage as she leads them to a large wooden door, behind which King Henry is meeting with his advisors.  Catherine bursts in playfully, interrupting her husband's business, for which he scolds her (1:20) and sends her away. <br /> <br />Catherine withdraws to her chambers (1:40), embarrassed by her public humiliation.  A male member of the court, witnessing Catherine's dejection, secretly enters her room (1:50) and comforts his queen.  Soon the two embrace in the throes of passion (2:04).  <br /> <br />Suddenly, the chamber door opens and the king enters, discovering the infidelity (2:31).  A great argument ensues, with the cuckolded king verbally lashing out at his wife.  Catherine tries to defend herself against Henry's onslaught (2:58), but to no avail.  The argument between husband and wife, which seems to go on forever, morphs into the subsequent trial of the queen, accused of both adultery and treason (3:55).  Catherine's eyes dart around the courtroom, looking in vain for her lover... or anyone supportive of her... but only the grim, accusing faces of those loyal the king meet her gaze (4:10). <br /> <br />The next scene finds Catherine in a dark, dank cell in the Tower of London (4:24), where she quietly awaits her fate.  Not surprisingly, the verdict is guilty (4:43), and Catherine collapses, crying. <br /> <br />The final scene is of the doomed queen, slowly ascending the steps of the wooden platform which has been constructed for her beheading (5:07).  Catherine kneels before the executioner, forgives him for what he is about to do (5:25), and turns her eyes upward as she pleads to God for her own forgiveness.  As she prays, the camera follows the executioner's upraised arms, focusing momentarily on the axe's blade before continuing its way skyward (5:48).  A momentary glint fills the screen (6:11) as we imagine the falling of the axe, followed by a white dove that passes through the frame on its way to heaven. <br />
B0008ENHTE|4.0|\\"Bullitt\\" is presented here in a glistening new two-disc set, showing how cool Steve McQueen really was. <br /> <br />The story, such that it is, has something to do with a mob accountant. And his brother. I think. <br />I'm not sure. Nor do I care. Because that's not the point. <br /> <br />The point of this film is for Steve McQueen to be cool, as a cop, in very real surroundings.  <br />Authenticity is the name of the game here, as each and every scene is filled with naturalistic flourishes, \\"real\\"-sounding dialogue (except for the romantic stuff, which doesn't even sound like it's from the same film...) and a noir-grit, dead-serious tone that amplifies the tension and drama. <br /> <br />Examples abound. Some of the early cop-to-cop dialogue scenes sound like they skipped a few words or lines, but then you simply give in to the rhythm that this is probably how cops would talk during that moment. <br /> <br />The hospital scenes, which I tend to be finicky about, were quite realistic and dramatic, except when Georg Stanford Brown spoke, playing a young surgeon. I later discovered he was probably the only real actor in the scene, as the rest of the cast was composed of real doctors and nurses. They get it right; he sounds like he's faking it. <br /> <br />The car chase, the prototypical, Rosetta Stone-ish source of all cinematic car chases, is done without music, lending extraordinary realism to it. The shot and angle selection have a \\"you-are-there\\" feeling absent in most current smash-'em-ups. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is filled with the people that film fanatics love to point out, like Mr. Roper.  <br />Jacqueline Bisset, here, is one of the five most beautiful women ever to be seen on film, or at least that's what I though whenever the camera lovingly showed her only wearing a man's button-down, long-sleeve shirt. Robert Vaughn is exquisitely oily. Simon Oakland made a living doing a variation of this very character, seen in everything from \\"Psycho\\" tothe TV film, \\"The Night Stalker.\\" <br /> <br />There's a lot to like in the film, and the extras on this DVD are WAY more than what you'd expect. <br /> <br />The McQueen doc is a killer career overview; the vintage featurette is a neat peek into the past during the making of the film with McQueen doing voice-overs, and the documentary of film editing should be required viewing for anybody who has ever watched a movie. <br /> <br />One thing that I did notice as sub-standard was the sound. The picture was super-fine and all, but the sound was kinda blah, with a lot of hissy background noise. So much so that I put on other discs and futzed with my system to make sure it wasn't \\"me\\". The movie was good enough that I only noticed it for a few seconds and then caved into the action again, but still... <br /> <br />For a killer of a deal, and a great long weekend's worth of films, buy this as part of the McQueen box. There's no chance of being disappointed.

B00006AVRK|4.0|Or is it Bingo who wants to be engaged? Or Bertie who doesn't? Or Gussie who does, but Madeline doesn't? Oh my, marital near-misses are the order of the day for these tales, as Bertie and his assortment of nitwits and numbskulls careen dangerously close to matrimonial bliss, only to escape at the last moment.<br /><br />There are innumerable pleasures to be had in these gorgeous dramatizations of Wodehouse's greatest duo. As a long time reader of the books, I know a bit of Bertie and his gentleman's gentleman. Though Stephen Fry is too young, he makes a sensational Jeeves. And Hugh Laurie inhabits Bertie in way that makes the viewer admire the very bally balliness of it all. The aged aunts, the cousins, girlfriends, and Spodes all shimmer and glisten. Pow-spot on!<br /><br />But these tales focus a bit too much on the madcap, the loony, the wacky. A book, with many pages of skillful narrative between the plot devices to set up the next one, does not generally degenerate into the cartoons these sometimes do. That being said, these DVDs are indeed fun. Not side-splitting riots. You'll not often laugh out loud, but you will be uplifted and cheered repeatedly. Continuously clever, they are generally a joy to watch. The Fry/Laurie interaction is a continual delight. The sets are astonishing, the clothes breathtaking. The ocean liner is positively amazing. The music is so well-chosen you wish a special recognition for it. The look, the sound, the feel is so right so many times one is forced to sit back in raw humble admiration.<br /><br />So why only four stars? Well, the starch went out of the writing as the show progressed; the later episodes are generally beneath the wit of the earlier ones. The Americans are almost uniformly awful, and since the writer chose to spend so much time in America (to cultivate an audience for the show?...I cannot understand why) we are forced to watch bad actors and actresses in long, tedious sequences. I cannot help but wonder what Fry and Laurie were thinking as these American doofuses dropped their lines as if they were hammering anvils. So-hours of fun, stuff that is worth owning as you will want to share them and re-watch. But missing the last ounce of energy and perfection that makes five star heaven. Worthy; better than nearly anything like them. But not perfect-no, far from it.these American doofuses dropped their lines as if they were hammering anvils.

B00005JKJA|1.0|I believe in strong stories that tell stories through symbols. One can experience a movie in a sensational way when viewing the undercurrents of a good story. I think of when I read books like The Scarlet Letter or The Chronicles of Narnia. <br /> <br />Yes, I understood the story of Mulholland Drive, despite its hodgepodge methodology in the storytelling, I did not benefit from seeing it. The \\"profound\\" way in which it was presented was tedious to say the least, and I found myself waiting for it to conclude, regardless of what other reviewers would say about its \\"fast-paced\\" third act. <br /> <br />As a friend of mine said, what we have here is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes. We have a director caught up in creating this and other movies which become fan favorites and which receive great praise for reviewers and critics; but, in the end, we're all to afraid to say that all we truly see is nothing more than a naked person walking down the street.
0307276902|5.0|In light of what has happened regarding Mr. Frey's two books, I feel the responsibility for fact checking is the responsibility of Doubleday and also of Oprah's staff.  I feel that Mr. Frey got caught up in all that there is with having a best selling book.  Yes, he should not have lied but his books needed to be classified in another category and again the responsibility of the publisher.  This is not the first time that this has happened with publishing corporations.  Mr. Frey was used as a scapgoat and publicly humiliated.  I read Million Little Pieces and bought copies for several people and have just purchased My Friend Leonard.  I will continue to read all the books that Mr. Frey writes.<br /><br />Jeann<br /><br />Pittsburgh, Pa
0895260131|5.0|There really is no reason to write a review because of the number of great reviews already here. I want to comment on all the negative reviews found here. The negative reviews found here are from muslims who have not read the book and from guilt-ridden, liberal, muslim apologists.   <br /> <br />The funniest thing about the negative reviews is that they are essentially all the same:  LIES! ALL LIES! GARBAGE!! HATE SPEECH!!  peace be upon the prophet, etc etc. They are only a few lines long and don't even ATTEMPT to challenge what is written in the book.  Now to be fair...there is one long review where a muslim tries to challenge what is in the book...but i think anyone with a 4th grade education and minimal critical thinking skills will realize that it falls short.  But nice try! <br /> <br />And to the hand-wringing liberals who say Christianity has just as many problems as Islam...and claim that the Religious Right are just as much terrorists as muslims are: first of all...i will agree with on one point..Christianity has had it's problems...a lot of people have done terrible things in the name of Christianity...but Christianity at it's core IS a religion of peace..the teachings of Christ can only be seen as that.  And to be a true Christian is to be peaceful and forgiving.  However, to be a true muslim is to be an intolerant a-hole who forces his relgion on everyone in sight and kill those who don't convert. You don't have to read this book to understand that!! Read the Quran!  Mohammed was a MURDERING, RAPING, PILLAGING DOUCHEBAG!!!  oh i've done it now! I've commited an offense punishable by death by the same folks who are protesting those cartoons!!  some member of the \\"religion of peace\\" will be calling for my head on a stake very soon!
B00005JOIF|5.0|One of the greatest ironies of international politics in the wake of World War II is that you can make an argument that the most fascist nation on the face of the planet is the state of Israel.  This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe.  But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing \\"struggle\\" for \\"order.\\"  Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time.  This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of \\"liberty\\" and \\"property,\\" but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well.  In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.<br /><br />The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the heart of Steven Spielberg's \\"Munich.\\"  The massacre of the Israeli athletes as the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing.  Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded.  There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village.  Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that \\"they're all gone\\" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing.  But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he had to do and later for what he has done.<br /><br />Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich.  Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them.  His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done.  Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.<br /><br />We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed.  The first has translated \\"The Arabian Nights\\" into Italian.  The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich.  They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics.  But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist?  Avren gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avren knows.  Meanwhile, as Avren and his men cross more names off of the their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre.  What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich.  The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book \\"Vengeance\\" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable.  While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible.  But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members.  Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home.  Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.<br /><br />I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God.  Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God.  The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better.  It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight.  The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing.  What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel \\"Munich\\" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.elis did in response to the Olympic massacre.

Great idea for a book, fun things (\\"Buggers\\") but after awhile I felt a little silly reading the ENDLESS descriptions of mock battles of six-year-olds. <br />Technical challenge: How could instantaneous communication across vast distances of space, even if it were possible, be achieved with a spaceship that is traveling at near-light speeds and thus would have a different scale of time?

0783232039|5.0|I had never seen this film until recently. I saw commercials for it years ago and it looked to me quite silly. But on saturday night 1 week ago, it just happened to be on right after the film the thing, and at first me and my dad had no idea what movie it was, at first i thought it was the newest chucky film seed of chucky where they have a kid, and to me that film looked even sillier. But anyways, what got me hooked was how beautful jennifer tilly was as a blonde, and her being part asian, (i think she is korean), i have seen her in many other movies, but she always had dark black hair, always lookin like a hot vuluptuous china doll, and she was incredible in the film \\"bound\\" But anyway me and my dad couldnt stop laughing as we watched bride of chucky, it's more like a dark comedy, definately some twisted humor and odd scenes that dont make you feel too much like an (...)to laugh at. Even my dad thought tilly looked beautiful, and i even said she looked great as a blonde, but said nothing else, because my dad doesn't know i'm bisexual. But anyway, my dad thought the voice of chucky this time was danny devito, the voices have always sounded the same to me, but i will check on it. I also finally saw seed of chucky, which was a little dumb, but still funny at times, and some dull humor. But all in all, i can appreciate the effort of the writers considering child's play is an old film, and one might think new chucky films seemed like a stupid unoriginal ideaa, but they pulled it off.. and my favorite part in this movie was when jennifer danced in that outfit for the guy that looked like a chick, go figure.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It's not surprising, but consistently disappointing that the Recording Academy fails to recognize great musicians like Sufjan Stevens.  I mean, c'mon, Kelly Clarkson?  And the tendency to keep voting for aging rock stars whose prime was 30 years ago--does anybody really think the latest albums by The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, or even U2 represent the best of their careers or come anywhere near the best recordings of the last year?     \\"Illinois\\" is a masterpiece and a quantum leap in conception and execution from Stevens's other albums (sorry, \\"Seven Swans\\" fans).  But I suppose he will be overlooked until one of his future songs (suggested song title from his \\"New York\\" album:  \\"Donald Trump, Or, How One Man's Hair Destroyed the West Side and Astonished a Generation\\") captures the airwaves as a novelty piece.  And then, maybe 7-8 years down the line, he'll be nominated as \\"Best New Artist\\"...

0671449028|5.0|My daughter has had stories read to her every night of her life right before bed. This book had always been the finale in the lineup. She is 2 1/2 now and may alternate between a few books but this one is still her favorite. She now does little actions when it is read. She tugs on my pajamas and then her's when the story says, \\"and find pajamas big and small\\". She does a brushing her teeth motion and it even helped her count to ten, when she counts all the animals doing exercise. My husband and I love it and think it is very rythmic. GET IT!!!!
B000AARKOO|5.0|Orlando Bloom packs on the pounds and muscle to play a 12th century blacksmith turned Crusader turned baron in this strong \\"historical\\" action-adventure.<br /><br />The action moves quickly from France to the Middle East, where the tale becomes a parable on the endless futility of Middle Eastern conflict. Despite a few \\"ripped from today's headlines\\" speeches, the action is well-done, the military conflict interesting and there are strong performances all around. The climactic battle at the Christopher Gate of Jerusalem, if it doesn't quite measure up to similar siege sequences in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, is exciting and involving, even if the populism seems a few centuries early.<br /><br />Great fun with a more rounded story than the more intense Gladiator.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for fans of getting medieval.
B000BNI90O|5.0|After seeing the first extended cut film, I skipped the theatrical versions of the next two, and skipped the soundtracks of all three theatrical cuts as well. This puts me way behind many other more, um, thorough (and probably richer) Ringers, but I want to add my voice to the chorus... <br /> <br />It is Howard Shore's master work, and getting every last note of it is worth waiting for. Although it is difficult to imagine, I think I would like the music as much even if there were no movie to be reminded of; unlike many soundtracks, this is standalone great music. <br /> <br />I listened to Howard's contributions to the commentary on the extended cut films, as well as his narration of the bonus \\"Creating the LotR Symphony,\\" and have to say that, while the man is clearly a gifted musician, a great talker he ain't; the booklet with this product is wonderful and shores up Shore's shortcomings (and I'm *not* shorry for that!) by doing an excellent job of musical analysis. <br /> <br />It is worth the price. The tragedy of the rubber nubbin has been mentioned: it is everyone trying to show how balanced they are, but honestly, a spare case is simple to find and that nit is barely worth picking. <br /> <br />BTW, in case you don't typically page down to earlier reviews, I want to mention one occurring about four pages back concerning the dvd format and play - it's very helpful to those, like me, not familiar (yet!) with getting the best out of music dvds. Look for the title starting \\"Note on the technical side.\\"
B00005ASHM|5.0|I don't know why the Beatles fans feel the need to put us in our place regarding this album. I was born in 1971, and my parents loved the Beatles. I didn't mind them, but never understood what the fuss was about. Mom and Dad did not dig the Beach Boys, but I liked what I heard on the radio as a kid. I also remember hearing \\"Good Vibrations\\" in the 70s Sunkist commercials. I loved all their car songs in the 90s, coinciding with my own amature drag racing phase in my 20s. And now I'm a dad, and have just discovered Pet Sounds and the later albums. Here is so much incredible music that I've never heard before! I love the variety of instruments and the beautiful melodies and harmonies. Listening to Pet Sounds in the car helped cure my road rage. Thank you Brian Wilson! <br />
055380457X|4.0|Even though most of the events discussed in are already known by those who normally follow tech news, it's still impressive to read them like events in a story. Author did an impressive job putting together the chronology of Larry Page and Sergey Brin's efforts and their 'healthy disregard for impossible\\"; It's a must read in my recommendations list.
B000001FDQ|5.0|Yngwie's best album by far. The classic Far Beyond the Sun and the Moses Now your Ships Are Burned are some of the greatest neoclassical songs ever. As to what Shotgun Method said. \\"Then you have the metal guitarists that came after him, like Peter Lindgren (Opeth), Fredrik Thordendal (Meshuggah, Special Defects) and Chuck Schuldiner (Death\\" Opeth and Meshuggah's guitarist's aren't that good and can't play like Yngwie. And I am sad to say that, Schuldiner isn't as good as Yngwie as well. RIP chuck. (Death is my favorite band by the way) This album is THE record for any aspiring guitarist or just music lovers in general. Along with Passion & Warfare, Surfing with the Alien, and all of the other great shred albums by others such as Becker and Gilbert. This is a must have
B00005M91K|2.0|This is no Disney film, that's for sure.  (BTW, I'm not a fan of Disney films).  When the movie began, I was enchanted by the beauty of the scenes.  Then I became comfused. Because I've traveled a lot, I recognized some places, but the scenes shifted without rhyme or reason, moving from continent to continent with  no transition or explanation.  I would have liked some narration (as in \\"Winged Migration\\").  The scenes soon went from breathtaking to grim.  There was endless footage of thousands of fluffy yellow chicks whisked along on conveyor belts, down chutes, into bins, etc.  A few minutes would have been plenty to demonstrate the cruelty.  One segment focused on the torsos of prepubertal indigenous girls adorned with extravagant beadwork on their shoulders but nothing below. Their vaginal clefts were clearly visible. I found this invasive and offensive, as I could see no point.  While there may be a powerful social message in this DVD, the content was chaotic and the message delivered with a hammer striking everywhere at once.   <br /> <br />This film is not for the fainthearted.  I certainly wouldn't want a child to watch it.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Now let's be honest with ourselves - Did anyone _really_ expect the first movie of the \\"prequel\\" series to live up to the hype? To fill the gigantic shoes that fans created for it? True, the characters in this particular installment are, as yet, ill-defined.  True, the action seems designed more to distract from the story than to move it along.  And true, there is a near constant tug-of-war within the film between Anakin Skywalker and Jar-jar Binks as to whom can be the most annoying.  But does any of this make this a bad movie? Or is it just the fact that it's not the Star Wars that we remember as kids, the phenomenon that sparked imaginations, changed lives, and shaped the future of movies to come? It's a bummer, but you can't go back to the way things were.  And if you can suspend your own expectations for a minute, turn off all the comparisons, and just enjoy a good old-fashioned movie (not an exercise in intellectual stimulation, I mean a MOVIE.  Something you just let pass through your eyes and smack into your brain, with a minimum of interference), well then this is as good a movie as any.  It's not the same as the original, but then, is anything?
0743454537|3.0|I actually really liked this book, up until the last fifty pages, or so. It's the story of Anna Fitzgerald, who was concieved as a genetic match for her big sister, Kate, who has a rare form of leukemia and needs an exact donor. All her life, Anna has been in and out of hospitals along with Kate - up until now. Now, as Kate desperately needs a kidney transplant, Anna at age thirteen has had enough. Anna gets herself a lawyer, and decides to sue her parents for medical emancipation. <br /> <br />It's a fascinating book, and a beautiful portrayal of a family that has always been haunted by disease. All of the characters are fully realized and deep and - even when you don't always like them - you always understand them, and see where they're coming from. I loved reading it, and up until the end, I thought that my next move would be to hunt down the rest of this lady's book. <br /> <br />And then I reached the end. Now, I'm not particuarly picky when it comes to my endings. I don't have to love the ending to appreciate it - it may not be the ending that I wanted to see, but as long as it makes sense, as long as it fits, I'm okay with it, I can close the book and feel satisfied. <br /> <br />I was curious to see where the book would go. I wanted to see if Anna would get her medical emancipation or if she didn't, and if she'd give Kate a kidney or not. I wanted to see if Kate would live or die. But I would have been okay if the book had ended right after the trial. Even if there had been a million more questions in my mind, even if I would have wanted to know what happened next, I would have been satisfied, and I would have closed the book and thought about it for a long time, mulling the characters and their dilemmas and struggles in my mind. <br /> <br />The end of My Sister's Keeper comes out of left field, and it made me angry - no, it made me furious. Story is very important to me - if I invest myself in a novel, if I let myself care and be carried away by a story, Iam trusting the writer to do okay by me. This felt like a cop-out, a yank for tears and shock and a surprise ending, but not a pleasant one. <br /> <br />It feels cheap, and as a reader, I feel cheapened. Instead of a wise, intelligent, subtle novel about a family brought together and broken apart by a terminal illness, I feel like I just read a Lurlene McDaniels tearjerker. <br />
B0000C1733|4.0|I have become pretty much a die hard chili pepper fan over the past several years and this was my first album. It is an excelent selecion for a first time listener. <br /> <br />Here are my views of each song: <br /> <br />Under the bridge- This is one of the greatest melodys of the 90's and shows the potential and how deep this band can go. <br />10/10 <br />Give it away- This is a pretty good song but it is not one of my favorites. <br />7/10 <br />Californication- This is the greatest song of the greatest album of the greatest band from the 80's on. It is the greatest sound my ears have ever heard. <br />10/10 <br />Scar Tissue- cool melody and smart lyrics <br />8.5/10 <br />Soul to Squeeze- Excelent song, but i would not have put it on the greatest hits. <br />7.5/10 <br />Otherside- Amazing song. one of the best \\"rock\\" songs the chili peppers have come up with. Great solo <br />10/10 <br />Suck My Kiss- This is an awesome song with great slap bass. <br />9/10 <br />By the Way- This is probably my favorite song to watch them perform. Not to special though <br />8/10 <br />Parallel Universe- well written song <br />8.5/10 <br />Breaking the Girl- The sound of this song compares to under the bridge but the lyrics are not as meaningful <br />9.5/10 <br />My Fiends- I wanted to die when i heard this. there are so many better songs the chili peppers have come up with than this. <br />4/10 <br />Higher Ground- Good choice to use one of stevie wonders songs. I like it <br />8.5/10 <br />Universally Speaking- nice melody <br />8/10 <br />Road Trippin- i like this song but i would have put i different song in its place <br />7.5/10 <br />Fortune Faded- i dont no where in hell this came from. but its a pretty cool tune <br />7.5/10 <br />Save the population- good chorus <br />8/10 <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is a pretty good selection but is missong some of my favorites. I think i migt reccomend to get californication and Blood Sugar sex magik together instead ofgetting this one.
0062502182|5.0|I actually found this book at a bookstore...all I had to do was read the introduction by this gifted writer to know that he is inspired from such a deep place within himself that we can only wish to find..I got home and began to read the book..by Chapter 2 I had ordered all of his books... <br />I have not used a highlighter on any book since 1976..end of college days..for the first time 30 years I find myself using this yellow highlighter at least once on each page.. <br />He is truly an inspiring writer..he is a teacher to any of us who will listen..and I find quite a philosipher...I am so glad to have stumbled across this writer..He is the writer that you wish to read slowly so as not to miss one word..his words seem especially chosen...He is a Master....
B00005JOGU|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Capote was subtle and brilliant as was the entire production of Capote. Although Capote was portrayed as complex and very flawed, he was still likeable. One line seemed to sum up much of the developing relationship between him and Perry, one of the killers. \\"We both lived in the same house, only I went out the front door and he went out the back door.\\"  By this he refers to his and Perry's sad early years and family tragedies.  This explains Capote's manipulative nature as it almost explains how Perry explodes into crime and murder.  All of the actors were excellent. From start to end I was engrossed in the developing characters. There was not one false note.
0451167716|5.0|I first read The Godfather in 1969, when it came out in hardcover, and I knew at that time that a classic was born. Today, I gave myself a 60th birthday present and finished my second reading of this book. After over 36 years, The Godfather remains a masterpiece of not only great crime fiction, but of modern literature. The Godfather introduced millions of readers (and later, moviegoers) to the first family of American crime, the Corleones, and their powerful legacy of tradition, blood and honor. The seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed and the allegiance to family are the themes that resonate throughout this excellent book, and continue to make The Godfather the definitive novel of the violent subculture that will remain  etched in my consciousness forever. If you've never read the book, perhaps because you've seen the movie -- fuhgetaboutit! Do yourself a favor and read Mario Puzo's The Godfather. It is truly an American classic!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Rent. Adapted from the 1996 hit broadway musical by Johnathan Larson is an amazing film. No, amazing is an understatement. Think along the lines of phenomenal, yet it is even more than than that. I haven't seen a really good film I can say I would stop people on the streets to see, but Rent renewed that for me, and even now my 525,600 minutes of the year have become enjoyable to the least, and this film has started off in a great way. <br /> <br />Brought on by it's information I found in magazines and talk shows, I thought maybe Rent would be something of originality. I have not been enjoying the recent slew of remakes, but am more than happy to see a film that is of difference than others. Not to mention, I haven't seen a musical on stage or film since the Little Shop of Horrors came to Arizona in 1999. I think good music is what every film needs. Rent had just a little bit more which made it even better than the rest. <br /> <br />In New York City, the life of several friends is being threatened and they can tell you that in their own way. Mark Cohen and Roger Davis (Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal) are threatened to leave their apartment building when former friend Benjamin (Taye Diggs) plans to build a so-called cyberspace club inside the building. But that's when fate meets love and Mimi (Rosario Dawson) a fellow attendant to the building, falls in love with Roger. <br /> <br />Past loves such as Mark's ex-girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel) who's fallen in love with proper but committed Lawyer, Joann Jefferson (Trace Thoms) come to each other once again as friends. Angel finds Tom and life is becoming more difficult as the reality of everything sinks in for the seven friends. But there is nothing to do but love each other and live on with past dreams. Death may come and find them, but love will hold strong no matter who you are. And even then you won't have to pay the rent. <br /> <br />I couldn't help but feel all throughout the movie that reality was more than captured in Rent, and it may sound far fetched because it is. Musicals are usually silly and make you laugh. Rent does make you laugh, there's no question about it. But you know you've watched a really good film when it stays with you long afterwards. In this case, I knew I had because even 24 hours after, I am going to see it again tomorrow. There's more than enough that's lifted off your mind as you relate the characters. Being a filmmaker myself, I could relate to Mark who took his beloved camera everywhere he went. <br /> <br />As for music, such songs as \\"Seasons of Love\\" and \\"What you own\\" will touch you in the heart and in the mind realizing these characters are really you. \\"Rent\\" and \\"Santa Fe\\" will bring out the dreams and hardships you once faced (and probably still face) in your life. On the other hand, \\"La Vie Boheme\\" will make you laugh and laugh and laugh...and then some. The whole soundtrack has been stuck in my head since yesterday yet I enjoy remembering them (just not when I try to sleep!). <br /> <br />Rent will hit you where you feel. There's more to Rent than anyone can explain. It's magic touches you, and for me, I'm a touchy feely kind of person, but have never been obessed with a film like this. It's one that stays with you long after, and is a film you can enjoy after a good long week. My week at school was not exactly the best, and that was all lifted off my shoulders when music was thrown in in less than 3 hours. Anyone can use Rent at anytime. There's No Day But Today.
B000AP04FG|3.0|The brief opening scenes are reminiscent of one romantic comedy. Probably you know the film. The scene is similar to the delightful conversations by the married couples talking directly to the camera about their marraiage. Yes, it's `When Harry Met Sally.' In `Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' however, we see how the husband and wife rekindle their love by trying to kill one another. <br /> <br />[IT'S JUST A COMEDY] Maybe you have heard many times that `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is an action film. It is true that there are several (perhaps one too many) explosions and a few shoot-outs, and one car chase sequence, but few of them are intended as hair-raising thrills. Director Doug Liman has an explicit goal of making the entire film not too serious about itself, even though the two central characters, married couple of professional assassins, attempt to kill each other after knowing the truths about their spouses.    <br /> <br />`Mr. & Mrs. Smith' looks like curious mixture of `Prizzi's Honor' and `The War of the Roses.' This Angelina Jolie/Brad Pitt film is sexier than those two films, but it has no darker tone of the former film, and less farcical touch of the latter.  <br /> <br />Now I am not complaining. `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has often disarmingly charming characters Mr. and Mrs. Smith played by Pitt and Jolie, and Mr. Smith's co-worker Vince Vaughn. I believe Angelina Jolie is still looking for a better script to do, and Pitt is just being Pitt himself - nice guy, really down-to-earth - but he doesn't need to explore the darker side as in `12 Monkeys.' I for one much prefer him in this film though he is not going to get Ocsar nomination for this role. <br /> <br />The script is terribly empty (after so many re-writes) and the weak ending of the final take obviously shows the traces of cutting and re-editing. But there is palpable chemistry enough between Jolie and Pitt, and amusing set-pieces to keep the audiences from getting bored. I mean, almost enough.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I found this movie to be very much a love story.  To span over two decades, they are simply two human beings in love.  Very moving and the scenery was beautiful.  I was overcome with emotion.
B000669GAI|4.0|\\"Rearviewmirror\\" is about what you'd expect from a career-spanning retrospective of one of the greatest and most sucessful bands of the 90's.  This double disc set features just about all the songs you'd expect to be on a Pearl Jam greatest hits album; from \\"Jeremy\\" to \\"Alive\\" to \\"Black\\" to \\"Glorified G\\" to \\"Do the Evolution\\", they're all here and they all sound great.  There's no unreleased or new material included here as bonuses, which is a disapointment, but that's why there's \\"Lost Dogs\\", and Brendan O'Brien's remixes of \\"Once\\", \\"Black\\", and \\"Jeremy\\", which are decent.  Hardcore fans will nit-pick over what's been included here and what hasn't, but for casual fans or new fans to the band, \\"rearviewmirror\\" is a more than worthy and solid entry point to one of the best and most influential groups to come out of the 90's.
B00002687X|5.0|Swedish Hair Metal Band made the big league with their album Wings Of Tomorrow, released in 1984.  Europe did a live gig in Bombay in the late eighties, I listened in and was immediately hooked. Wings Of Tomorrow was the first Europe Album I bought and listen to it even today. <br /> <br />The album is pure kick ass Metal. John Norum's lead guitaring is simply out of this world...lots of influence from Deep Purple with the keyboards (especially on their later albums as well) <br /> <br />This album is a must have for all rock and metal freeks.
B0007OASII|4.0|Kamelot is hands down the best power metal band I heard as of yet.  Thomas Youngblood is Mr. Power Metal himself.  Fast, exciting, and full of energy!  Roy Khan, the vocalist, adds an entire new layer to the band.  His voice is one of the most incredible in metal.  He is among my favorite vocalists along with Russel Allen (Symphony X) and James LaBrie (Dream Theater).  Two friends of mine became fans of Kamelot solely due to Khan's voice, and they were never metal fans. <br /> <br />The Black Halo did not live up to my expectations.  It is still a good album, but I wanted more from Kamelot. <br />1)March of Mephisto - 5/5 <br />2)When The Lights Go Down - 5/5 <br />3)The Haunting (Somewhere in Time) - 6/5, you MUST hear Khan on this track.  <br />4)Soul Society - 3/5 <br />5)Interlude <br />6)Abandoned - 2/5   <br />7)This Pain - 3/5 <br />8)Moonlight - 4/5 <br />9)Interlude II <br />10)The Black Halo - 3/5 <br />11)Nothing Ever Dies - 4/5 <br />12)Momento Mori - 4/5 <br />13)Interlude III <br />14)Serenade - 3/5 <br /> <br />I personally think Karma and Epica are far far superior albums but if you are new to Kamelot, or power metal, then this album is a decent start.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan is back :) Along with select few other albums this year (Gimme Fiction,Plans,Takk) I anticipated Sufjan's album, and was able to grab a copy the day it was released. You see, I had fallen in love with Sufjan's \\"Michigan\\" album, which I received as a birthday present. <br /> <br />Oh, boy, this CD does not disappoint. I might as well just get into it: the album is beautiful at the right time, grand without being grandiose (if that makes sense), articulate but not pretentious, and catchy without succumbing to mainstream commercialism. Sufjan is everything I love about music, and more specifically, everything I love about independent music which I have obsessed with over my teenage years.  <br /> <br />As you may have read, Sufjan's album is sort of a collection of historical anecdotes about Illinois, in verse. This may sound a difficult venture to pull off, but you would never even know he was trying. Song-writing comes so naturally to Sufjan, I would say he was born to do it. Tracks like \\"UFO Sighting\\", \\"Wayne Gacy Jr.\\", \\"Chicago\\", \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\", and \\"Come on, Feel the Illinoise\\" will prove to you his talent for music and song.  <br /> <br />Yet, writing a single song would not be enough to make an album. Sufjan is able to blend 22 tracks of just about every subject matter imaginable, and make it fit into the one, single, unified masterwork that is \\"Illinois\\". Listen to how the trumpets of track two (too long to name) segue perfectly into \\"Illinoise\\", and you will see talented album crafting. <br /> <br />The album will get to me every time, just as Sufjan intended. For me, this is the one best album made in 2005(my other favorites can be found in my reviews). <br />
B000028U0Y|5.0|What can be said about this classic performance, it is an essential recording, it not only marks a rare period of time in the performers life and career. But it is unique in that it is one of, if not the first, performance of its kind to be recorded and made availbale to the public. Clearly a precursor to the MTV unplugged series. which seems to have come and gone. And yet more then twenty years past its release date, and now having appeared in every medium ever known to mankind. This master recording is again  available. This is a must have article by a artist who no doubt influenced many artist of many art forms. <br /> <br />Peace,Love and Beauty: <br />The*Hot*Wax*Kid
B00005JNJV|4.0|Batman Begins certainly isn't perfect, but it more than does the job of instilling new life into the Batman cinematic universe.  It's unfortunate that any filmmaker had to actually start from scratch and reexamine the origins of Batman, but what else can you do after 1997's Batman and Robin?  It should never have come to that, as Batman is by far the most compelling and human superhero ever envisioned.  I don't think the film truly gets the back-story right, but it does hit on Bruce Wayne's primary motivation - the fact that legal and political restraints keep the cops from truly succeeding on too many occasions.  As for that back-story, the murder of Bruce's parents is presented quite well, and his childhood before and after that fateful night also works.  Wayne the young adult, however, doesn't work for me.  Director Christopher Nolan really overplayed, in my opinion, the guilt factor and turned young Bruce into a jerk - when Katie Holmes has to slap some sense into you, you know you're a jerk.  And then there is the matter of Wayne's 7-year disappearance.  Personally, I think the story of Batman's foreign training in those years is best left shrouded in mystery.  In the movie, we see him trained by none other than Ra's Al Ghul - and that works great and really helps tie this movie together.  If you're familiar with Batman's history, however, you have to ask: who in his right mind would have Bruce Wayne train under Ra's Al Ghul, of all people?  In the comics, Batman never even met the guy until he kidnapped Robin and tried to recruit Batman to be his successor and son-in-law.<br /><br />As you can see, I had a few problems with the first section of the film.  Once Wayne returns to Gotham City, however, and dons the cowl of the Batman, the film finally kicks in with all cylinders.  It's great to see a dark and gritty side to the character; when this version of Batman says \\"he'll talk to me,\\" he knows whereof he speaks.  That's the kind of dark knight that can raise a little heck, even in a city as corrupt and socially broken as Gotham City.  After a rather clumsy and embarrassing debut, a rather ruthless (yet just) Batman soon begins spreading fear among the fear-mongers of his city.  He doesn't win many friends with Gotham's finest (other than Sergeant Gordon), but that's understandable.  Even if half of the force weren't already bought and paid for, the fact that Batman causes untold millions of dollars in damages on the streets (not to mention the roofs) of the city doesn't really inspire a lot of good will among guys in suits.<br /><br />Nolan certainly succeeds when it comes to making his movie as realistic as possible, especially in terms of the big chase scene.  Realism bows to unbelievable theatrics all too soon, especially in terms of the big plan to purge Gotham City of its sins and social degeneration, but even this fits well inside the Batman milieu - and it makes for some pretty exciting action on the screen.<br /><br />The link between Gordon and Wayne, which extends all the way back to Wayne's childhood, is subtly done.  Michael Caine is surprisingly good as the venerable Alfred.  Morgan Freeman (the best actor in Hollywood, for my money) lends great presence to an otherwise minor character.  I also liked the dichotomy established between Bruce Wayne and Batman - it's not explored all that deeply in the film, but the foundation is there for any future sequels.  As for Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), I have to come down on the side of those asking why her character was even in the film.  I see what Nolan did with the character, and I suppose she does help define Wayne as well as Batman, but this film could have easily done away with her character and never skipped a beat.  Ra's Al Ghul alone provides more than enough insight into Wayne's mindset, as he is basically the very type of man Bruce Wayne might have become were it not for his principles.  Ra's Al Ghul, after all, feels himself to be a noble force for justice in a world of degenerate behavior.<br /><br />There's really no doubt about the fact that Batman Begins is the best Batman movie to date.  Christian Bale grows into the role (both figuratively and literally - gaining back all the weight he lost for The Machinist) quite well as the story progresses, the supporting cast is loaded with big stars who live up to their names, and the special effects (even all of those CGI bats) are awe-inspiring and fun to watch.  Most importantly, though, Christopher Nolan succeeds in putting the dark back into the Dark Knight.for justice in a world of degenerate behavior.   <br /> <br />There's really no doubt about the fact that Batman Begins is the best Batman movie to date.

B00004U2GH|5.0|This is classic stuff done by a masterful artist at the top of his game. Though he would continue to amaze his audiences for many years to come. This disc is filled with all of the elements that made johnny Cash the legend that he was in his own time and would continue to be. For some recordings there is little to be said as they simply speak volumes by their own creative nature. You should have this, I would'nt be caught dead without this great performance, but then I am biased, I thought that the guy was a top  notch performer with so much to share.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw Serenity in the theater because the trailer hooked me - outer space, interesting characters, hot action scenes. I LOVED it because it was so much more than that. We were just so surprised at the depth of characters, the smart wit and chemistry of the crew and an actual plot - rare in a lot of space/action movies. The effects were great, and it was so much more than your average sci-fi movie. And the best part for me was - no cheesie aliens. =)<br /><br />As soon as Serenity was available on DVD, we bought it and have watched it several times. It's our \\"go-to\\" movie when there's nothing on TV. Every time we watch it, we pick up on something else we missed. I think we've seen it at least 8 times since we brought it home and I'm still not tired of it.<br /><br />From the bonus features we found out about the series Firefly - and still can't believe we didn't know about it when it was on the air. We've since bought the series too, and have been cycling through watching the movie, then the series, then the movie and so on. The movie is stand-alone, and I still see it as a great intro to the show for me, but you pick up on so much more when you get to know the characters through the short-lived series.<br /><br />All I can say is, I'm a converted 'Browncoat' and there's nothing I want more than a sequel to this movie. Everyone I know that borrows it and watches it falls in love with it like we did, and then they borrow the show - and they, too can't believe it was cancelled.<br /><br />The 'Verse Joss Whedon and the crew have created is something special. There's never been anything like it. And I want MORE!!!
B000006OBQ|5.0|well don't just sit there Joe doubter, what do you think, it was all just 60s hype. I could just belt you in the mouth, no, see this guy was The Chairman of the Board. He would blow into town  sometimes alone, sometimes with Dino, sometimes with Sammy and the rest of the pack. And there would be bottles and bottles of booze and dozens and dozens of broads. And an unsuspecting but always willing crowd, Dressed to kill (so don't even talk about fly) with hairdoos and furs, suits and chapeaus, brooches and pinky rings (come on,you had to have a pinky ring) and these guys would stop time and just mesmerize the audience. They would pay more than top dollar to laugh, cry, eat and drink, and most importantly of all, well yeah you would think that the music was the most important, but not quite. Well it was great when they actually sang,like on this disc. Where ole blue eyes is doing it solo. No the thing was to just be there and watch these cats do their thing while it all lasted. And beleive me it all ended way too soon.-------------------                               peace: The*Hot*Wax*Kid
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I originally caught 5 minutes of the show when it briefly aired on FOX and thought it was boring.  When some much needed downtime came up I bought the series because so many people were saying how good it was.  They were right.  However, the movie was even better than the short-lived series.  Do yourself a favor and invest the 2 hours or so and watch this.  If you like sci-fi or just fun movies watch this.  In a world of remakes and lack or originality Serenity was a breath of frest air.
1400034779|4.0|After hearing rave reviews from friends and acquaintances about this series, I bought the paperback of the first book. I thought the series would be like Murder, She Wrote in Africa. Boy, was I wrong. This book has a charm that is all its own. Instead of having the entire story revolve around one mystery or plot, it has vignettes of mystery and intrigue. Much of the beginning of the novel is narrative background material. At first, this confused and bored me, but then I embraced the meandering story and realized that this is not an intense series about mysteries being solved, but instead a series about a strong woman who interacts with her community and solves mysteries. Once I realized the difference, I enjoyed the rest of the book completely.<br /><br />The cover has a matte texture, but doesn't pick up dirt as easily as I'd expect. This is good since I like paperbacks for dropping in my purse for reading on a train ride or unexpected wait.
0307120007|5.0|My 1 year old loves this book!  It's very interactive and just great!  Highly recommended and also a great gift.
0385507755|5.0|This book gets to you..., it does because it reflects the James Frey in all of us. The book is well written and its easy to see how some facts had to change, exagerated or just made up to make the plot work, specially at the end...I'm glad that I read the book. If not all the story is true, enough of it is to make a difference. The author is one of the best new writers, lets hope he doesn't stop writing...
B000002J2F|5.0|'Duke' (1980) is one of my four favorite Genesis releases, the other three of which are 'Selling England by the Pound (1973), 'A Trick of the Tail' (1976) and 'Wind & Wuthering' (1977).  Before I bought 'Duke,' I had only heard the two songs which were extracted from the album and played incessantly on the radio: \\"Turn It On Again\\" and \\"Misunderstanding.\\"  As I was simply curious about the remainder of the album--and because I really like Genesis--I bought 'Duke,' along with 'Abacab' (1981), for a very reasonable price.    I know which one I prefer.    'Duke' is an engaging and dark masterpiece.  Woven into a fabric of dazzling complexity are the woeful and tangibly depressing twin themes of unfulfilled endeavor and unrequited love.  Originally a concept album, 'Duke' exemplifies just what a completely contiguous album can sound like.  There is little or no filler on 'Duke;' each of the songs has a purpose and is in itself masterfully constructed.    The instrumentation on 'Duke' belies the number of musicians--the trio of Mike Rutherford (bass, guitar), Tony Banks (keyboards/synthesizers), and, of course, Phil Collins (drums, vocals).  Where one would expect sparse arrangements and a narrow range of timbres, he instead finds a lush and dynamic soundscape which captivates and envelops him with harmonious and glorious polyphony.  And yet, when it's appropriate, 'Duke' can be simplistic yet dripping with emotional impact.  Its softer moments are among the most melancholic and meaningful in all of music.  And, by contrast, its loudest sections are thunderous and apocolyptic, distraught and passionate.  Indeed, 'Duke' runs the gamut of emotion.    The technical musicianship on 'Duke' is very strong.  Phil's drumming is impeccible; his vocals soar and swoon--sometimes tender and repensive, other times distressed and heartbroken, other times commanding; Mike's guitar and bass work is invaluable and well-placed; and Tony's keyboards hold the piece together and form a soundscape so rich and varied it reminds of a spectacular plush Oriental rug.  No note or drum beat is out of place; every element of every song on this album is intentional and ingenius.  There is so very little one could fault with this release.    One especially intriguing aspect of this release is the subset of songs which form what has been called the \\"Duke Suite.\\"  The first three tracks (which play seamlessly), the seventh, and then the last two (which also play into one another) carry the 'Duke' theme more prominently than the remainder of the album, and when taken together reperesent almost 29 minutes of top-notch musical entertainment.  The finale is breathtaking.    Without further ado, the song-by-song breakdown:      1.  \\"Behind The Lines\\" - This is a highly energetic piece which establishes one of the motifs which returns later in the album.  The beginning is two minutes plus of instrumental, where the band really shines.  One misses the prominence of the Hammond organ somewhat (it's sort of buried on this album), but after listening a few times, he realizes this instrument would be out of place if it were brought to the forfront.  Instead, a synthesized brass section lends an orchestral flair to this masterwork.  One of the two elements of the Duke story--the girl with whom Phil found himself infatuated is cold and heartless and does not return his feelings--is introduced in this track.  Anchored by a driving rhythm and an intriguing musical landscape, this song segues into the next track.    2.  \\"Duchess\\" - This track begins with an exotic early drum machine pattern, over which--one by one--more instruments, including Tony's synthesizers and his Yamaha CP-series electro-acoustic piano, begin to play.  This builds the tension and urges the listener onward.  Several minutes into the piece, Phil's drums start up in a march-like beat, and with a dramatic filtering effect, the song takes flight.  This song's subject matter is the other half of the Duke odyssey, that which deals with the rise and fall of the female singer (Duchess).  This becomes Duke's fate as well, incidentally.  Just as it began, this song deteriorates into no more than the drum machine and the CP electric piano.  This track segues into the the third track.    3.  \\"Guide Vocal\\" - Yes!  This song is simply BEAUTIFUL!  Within this song is some of the most heart-wrenching emotional outpour ever recorded in less than 1:30.  It ranks right up there with \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" (The Who, 'Who's Next,' 1971).  The last line will give prospective listeners chills.  Soft and pensive, nostalgic and woefully longing, this song will draw tears as a needle draws blood.  If this song seems too short for you, don't worry: It returns later in the album.    4.  \\"Man Of Our Times\\" - The first song which is not part of the Duke subset, this one nonetheless contributes a great deal to the album.  The story is of a great man (perhaps a politician) who is, as the chorus informs us, \\"A Man Of Our Times.\\"  The principle melody is catchy and evocative.  Phil uses his distressed vocal variation here, and to great effect.    5.  \\"Misunderstanding\\" - This is the ubiquitous (and overplayed) track which, when given its due place in Duke,' gains newfound relevance.  I don't feel I need to really comment upon this one considering that everyone and her ugly cousin has heard this song, unless she has been living under a rock keeping her ugly cousin company.    6.  \\"Heathaze\\" - Ah.  Bliss.  The first adjective which comes to mind is \\"fragile,\\" or perhaps \\"delicate.\\"  It has a forlorn and malancholic cast which speaks of accepting a loss and moving on.  I have always liked Tony Banks's work (\\"Mad Man Moon\\" from 'A Trick of the Tail' is my absolute favorite Genesis song).  The CP electric piano and Phil's tear-stained vocal begin this song, which eventually builds to a full instrumental involvement at each of the two repetitions of the B section.  The chorus, once again using a dramatic filtersweep to monumental effect, is powerful and meaningful.  I really like this song; it's one of the best on this album.  The drums have exceptional life on this track; they sound lifelike and immediate.  Tony's synthesizer pads impart just the right atmosphere to this piece; spacey and detached, yet still relevant.    7.  \\"Turn It On Again\\" - The second of the two singles from 'Duke,' this is a really great song, as well as being an isolated element of the Duke Suite.  Despite its pop overtones, one cannot with a straight face say this song does not contain progressive elements.  The disjointed and syncopated rhythm, the synthesized orchestra--overlayed with the CP electric piano and underlayed with an obligato figure in the bassline--imparts a unique and purely \\"Genesis\\" flavor to this track.  It sounds somewhat like an impromptu in the beginning, what with the nicked guitar chord and the spoken count down.  I often follow this song's instructions: Turn it on again, and again (and again)...    8.  \\"Alone Tonight\\" - This is more in the vein of Phil's solo work, except that I have a valid litmus test to differentiate it from such: I like it.  I never really cared for Phil Collins the solo artist; he was nothing without Genesis.  This song is a formulaic pop song, but it still has that unmistakable exploratory edge which separates good pop from bubble gum.  Coupled with the typical atmospheric 'Duke' aroma, this song takes the high ground as far as pop is concerned.    9.  \\"Cul-De-Sac\\" - The precursor to some of the (synthesized) orchestral maneuvers of the last two tracks (tympani make their first appearance on the album in this track), this song chronicles the odyssey of a ruler who is destined to be ousted and forgotten, despite his belief that he is all-powerful and still in control.  After a dynamic and intricate bridge, the B section repeats, followed by a clever series of chord progressions/inversions which end on a cadence within the original key, then a faux-symphonic ending on a blasting chord.    10. \\"Please Don't Ask\\" - I really don't like this one.  Not for lack of trying, but there are parts of this song I just can't stand.  The lyrics seems a bit stressed, and there's a guitar part which reminds horribly of an awful 70's ballad.  And the echoed background vocals sound like something you might hear on an Earth Wind and Fire album (ugh!).  And whenever a song's lyrics include something like \\"You've lost some weight I see, your hair looks nice,\\" I just cringe.  Awful, just awful.  Now that doesn't go for the entire song; there are salvagable parts, but seeing as it has already been written (and that was over 25 years ago), there's no changing it.  Overall, a very weak track.  And it's a necessary part of the story, too, so one must listen to it.  It's a pity, really.    11. \\"Duke's Travels\\" - Just when I had lost faith in the band after the lamentable previous track, we pick up on the Duke Suite again with this latest installment.  After two minutes of absolutely gravitational keyboard work (breaking waves, rolling tympani, and a string/brass combination synth), the drums announce the beginning of the journey proper.  A synth sound which is an uncanny imitation of a clarinet paints the journey for the listener, sometimes relieved by saxophones (synthesized), and sometime brass.  At timecode 4:57, adversity strikes with some spectacular polyphony and minor key progressions.  At timecode 5:48, an epiphany strikes, and at timecode 6:11, perfection!  A reprise!  The \\"Guide Vocal\\" lyrics are repeated, extruded, and laid over an animated bed of instrumentation which morphs into a cathedral-worthy synthesizer organ and a bawling violin in the extreme high register.  After an instrumental completion of panultimate fulfillment, a simple sine-wave poly-synth leads into the finale track.    12. \\"Duke's End\\" - Very few albums end on the scope of 'Duke.'  This finale track incorporates themes from several tracks, including the first and seventh.  The very ending is monumental and, with incontrovertible finality, the music stamps down its symbolic foot in the form of a thunderous B Major chord and shouts, \\"THE END!\\"  WOW!  PHENOMENAL!      All that having been said (and having just listened to the album in its entirety while writing this review), I am loathe to bring myself down from the pillar of sonic nirvana to comment on something as mundane as the recording quality of this \\"Definitive Edition\\" of 'Duke.'  Nonetheless, it's part of all my reviews.  For the most part, the remastering job is supurb.  In particular, the dynamics are exceptional.  The balance between the instruments is very good as well.  Unfortunately, there are instances (most apparent in \\"Man Of Our Times\\") where the vocals are almost entirely drowned out by the instruments.  I can't even understand what Phil is singing because I really can't hear him.  I think this was just somebody asleep at the switch when this was remastered.      I have no other editions of 'Duke,' so I cannot compare this remaster to other releases, but I must point out that the cold and somewhat brittle timbre of this album is intrinsic.  It was recorded in one of the first all-digital studios in the world, at a time when digital was in its infancy.  An inescapable artifact of all early-era digital recording was aniceptic-, brittle-, and \\"shiny-\\" sounding audio.  No remastering job can compensate for this condition.  Even so, a 6 dB cut in the extreme high spectrum treble, accompanied by a 6 dB cut at 125 Hz and a 3 dB cut at 63 Hz, clears up some of the unsavory aspects of this remaster.  Other than that, it sounds very good.      At the end of the day, I would recommend 'Duke' to just about anyone willing to spend some time listening to it.  It takes a little acclimation; one cannot simply immerse oneself in a progressive masterpiece like 'Duke' after having spent his entire life listening to AOR (or worse, hip hop).  Those with an open mind, andthose who have darker personalities, will really appreciate the masterpiece that is 'Duke.'
B00006879E|5.0|When \\"This Love\\" performed by Maroon 5 started playing on the radio I was so sure I had already heard this music before that I've said to a friend... \\"Man, I haven't heard this music for a long time....\\". <br /> <br />I know it's new but I believe there was something very similar by the early nineties, just can't figure out what..... Anyone had this deja vou feeling ? <br />
0743424425|5.0|This is one of Stephen King's best books and one of my all-time favorites. If you've only seen the movie and not read the book, you're doing yourself a disservice! The movie can't compare to the book in the slightest. Personally, I don't care for the movie anyway, and don't think it is all that great. And, I saw the movie, or at least bits and pieces of it, before I even read the book. <br /> <br />This book draws you in from the onset and doesn't let go. One of the parts I liked a lot was a scene in the hedge maze. The hedges have been clipped to look like various animals, and one day, they come alive.. or don't they? I won't give away the answer, but suffice it to say, they might be after someone..  <br />The way it was written, it's easy to believe they took on lifelike qualities, much like the hotel itself as it begins to awaken.. <br /> <br />As most people know, Jack steadily goes insane as the fall turns into winter. Yet when the family first arrived at the hotel, Jack had intended to use the seclusion and isolation to his advantage as he worked on a novel. However, things didn't go as smoothly as he'd intended, and the ensuing writer's block drove him to drink. Therefore, as the weather gets colder and the snow starts to fall and get steadily deeper, he is soon lost within the confines of not only the hotel, but his own mind.  <br /> <br />And not to mention, the chilling secret surrounding room 217..  <br /> <br />To make things worse, Jack's son, Danny has 'the shining' and is able to see the people who haunt the hotel.. not to mention that he is aware of his father's steady decline, although he is powerless to stop it. <br /> <br />This book is great, and I highly recommend it; especially if you've never read SK before and aren't sure where to start. <br />
0307276902|5.0|I read this book long before all of the media hype and thought it was amazing.  While reading it I felt some of it was a bit embellished, but it didn't matter.  I truly felt I was w/the author as he fought his demons, it had me on the edge of my seat.  The characters intrigued and haunted me.  This book is a must read for anyone trying to overcome addictions and I'm sure has inspired many people.  The message it brings overrides any sort of debate on Larry King or Oprah.   <br /> <br />Frey's book \\"My Friend Leonard\\" is even better!
B00005JO04|3.0|Well, after seeing Syriana I feel compelled to turn in my Capitalist card first thing in the morning and run right out to join the Jihad. Apparently America IS the greatest exporter of evil in the history of evil. Isn't that what this movie wants me to believe?<br /><br />I'm joking, of course.  Not funny, I know.<br /><br />The movie is pretty good, but the message isn't.  Really, am I supposed to sympathize with a suicide bomber?  Sorry, I don't think so.  Meanwhile, Clooney drives his Mercedes through the Hollywood hills to his walled-off, million dollar home.  Hypocracy has no shame.
B0007M22TI|5.0|A lot of really good performers have come out of Ireland lately. But nothing beats these Celtic women.<br /><br />Orla Fallon's rendition of `The Isle of Inisfree' is a thing of sheer beauty. Achingly tender and haunting, it perfectly captures the feeling of longing for one's homeland. Not only can the lady sing, she plays the harp so perfectly as well. How so much talent can reside in one person simply escapes me.<br /><br />Johann Sebastian Bach and Charles Gounod's `Ave Maria' has always been my favorite piece from the classical era and Chloe Agnew's performance surely does not disappoint; her pure, crystal-clear soprano is astounding. She may have out-charlotted Charlotte Church in this one!<br /><br />Meav's performance of `Danny Boy'? Effortless and simply breathtaking, lending more credence to a tune that has literally become Ireland's national anthem. Her rendition of `The Wealthy Widow' is driving and catchy in its liveliness, no doubt further enhanced by the percussion section's vigorous and insistent beat. It's a very enjoyable number to listen to due to its very upbeat rhythm and easy to follow melody, though I don't understand a word of it (was it in Gaelic?).<br /><br />Lisa Kelly's rendition of `May It Be' is how a song of this type must be sung - simple and straightforward - without the need for unnecessary embellishment or, as one observer accurately put it, vocal acrobatics. Indeed, a song need not be performed with much fancy and adornment to produce the desired result that comes easy to a listener's ears. Lisa has shown that a singer does not have to twist and bend notes to reach an audience. Simplicity is beauty.<br /><br />What can I say about Mairead Nesbitt's talent as violinist? Lively and infectious, she is such an animated instrumentalist. She shows how a public performance must be done if a performer ever hopes of catching the audience's attention.<br /><br />Exemplary as soloists in their own right, the ladies are also outstanding singing as a group. Their acapella rendition of `Somewhere', a Leonard Bernstein masterpiece from West Side Story leaves nothing more to be desired. So perfect is their rendition that they practically turned their voices into four different musical instruments.<br /><br />If there's a way to rate these Celtic ladies' performance above the 5-star rating, I want to know.tanding singing as a group.

B000059QY3|5.0|I don't know of a \\"perfect\\" performance of \\"Traviata\\". This one has been criticized but my experience indicates the pluses far outweigh the minuses. I purchased the DVD because my curiosity was piqued when I learned that the legendary conductor, Sir Georg Solti, had been very impressed with Angela Gheorghiu's \\"Violetta\\".  The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden venue, et al., also aided in my purchase decision.  <br />My subsequent viewing/listening experience proved to be extremely satisfying (and emotional).  Ms Gheorghiu carried this role with a brilliance of interpretation I have not often noted in other colorature and Solti's sensitive, never-overpowered reading was a complement to her enactment.  She displayed a gift for melding artistically, physically and credibly with this role.  I found her mesmerizing.  <br />The other vocalists carried their roles capably.  Frank Lopardo displayed the passionate, frenetic being of Alfredo and Leo Nucci's Germont was well in keeping with the age fraility of the Alfredo pere not often seen in other baritones who have provided more dominant characterizations. A few have criticized Ms Gheorghiu's Violetta somewhat harshly; some of these are unfair and not substantive for this live event. I believe she ranks among the best-recorded Violettas not only for her outstanding interpretation but also for her symbiosis with the supporting cast.
B000AYEI5Y|2.0|I didn't purchase this album but I borrowed it from my dad out of curiosity.  I must say that James Blunt is one of those types of artists that seems to have it all....(ie cool voice, emotional lyrics etc) however his ability to write a catchy song (save You're Beautiful) is simply void.  Someone in this list of reviewers compared him to Elton John.  LOL....That's a good one.    This disk isn't horrible.  But it's not particularly inspiring either.  Nothing on the disk motivates me to listen a 2nd or 3rd time. <br /> <br />  By the way, we were unfortunate enough to get the CD with the f-word explicative in the song, You're Beautiful, which blared out with our 3 kids listening in the car.  Thanks alot, James.

0679422714|5.0|This biography describes a man far different from the image that many wish to project. Reading this book was an eye opening experience for me. I was amazed at how many opportunities there were to stop this monster, yet were missed. So many of the events described in this book occurred during my life. For the first time, I was able to clearly understand the motivations and driving forces that created those events that I saw as an observer from the outside. The pain and suffering of the Chinese people should serve as a warning to all of us of the dangers posed by allowing any one person to assume so much power. This is, I believe, a major flaw in Communism, in that it allows such easy manipulation of power by so few. This book should rank high on the reading lists of high school and college classes dealing with history or \\"current events.\\"
B000003H34|4.0|I just pulled this out of my music library the other day. This is not bad...I always used to compare this to Serenades (Essential doom/death) and Pentecost III, and toss it aside. But, after all these years, I recognize that I may have overlooked the gems on this album. And there are quite a few. For all those fans who like the doom genre or My Dying Bride or Paradise Lost, this is an essential addon to your library.  This album has Anathema starting to move away from Doom/Death with many songs actually sung. But, I have to say, the ones which I like the best are NOT. Restless Oblivion, Cerulean Twilight and A Dying Wish are classics. ....Alone is a great track with so much emotion. In fact, this Doom/Death genre or whatever it is, overflows with emotion. Brilliant. A definite buy. And please don't compare A Fine Day to Exit to this or anything before it. Its two completely different genres. Though, I have to say that Serenades, Pentecost III, and The Silent Enigma albums definitely stand out from the crowd...Fine Day to Exit blah blah don't compare....

B00008DDSC|5.0|Despite all the hype and hubbub about this film, it has nothing to do with S&M and only a little to do with sex. Secretary tells the story of a sweet little romance between two messed-up people. Maggie Gyllenhaal is letter-perfect as Lee Holloway, a spirited but troubled young woman with a history of self-mutilation and serious issues with independence. She's hired for her first-ever job by attorney Edward Gray (James Spader), whose aggressive work persona conceals both a genuine concern for Lee's welfare and a raft of deep-seated insecurities. Their dynamic evolves slowly into a playfully fulfilling domination/submission relationship, involving a lot of mental powerplay but no nudity or genital contact.    See this movie to appreciate how Lee owns her newfound submissive identity and, through it, finds genuine emancipation and empowerment. See it to appreciate the deep vulnerabilities of a man who appears utterly controlling at first glance. See it to appreciate the intimate equality of love within a relationship that most people would assume could be neither intimate nor equal.
B0000259IH|5.0|If people do not think this is a great album (although do not like MJ), they got a real problem! I really love all the 4 singles. Don't Stop (late disco anthem and like PYT, the hit at many black college parties) was the 6 minute floor banger, Rock With You was the smooth R&B groove that is still on fire, Off The Wall (was the only top ten not made into a video) is another floor banger with fresh Friday Nite partying lyrics, and She's Out of My Life completed the top ten streak with the emotional lyrics and mind you that there was no sound effects, MJ was really crying like Lenny Williams throughout the song, which made it a real hit.  Although an R&B chart disappointment, it was number 10 on the pop charts and still supported on R&B radio along with his other hits.  Other tracks such as the overly sampled smoother I Can't Help It, the funky Get On The Floor, the sultry McCartney penned Girlfriend and of course the disco groundbreaking B-side, Working Day and Night (performed on every Michael Jackson tour including Truimph and Victory tours) were more than 5 star novelties.  Damnit, I love all the tracks from the lp.  My father got the original lp about 3 years before I was born, first heard it when I was still a baby and It's still on fire.  Although this can't beat Thriller, but its better than Bad and MJ got cheated at the grammys with the lp.  One nomination for best R&B male vocalist!!  This may be his most urban lp, but it is still a fantastic pop album/CD and he is the first artist to have at most, 4 top 10's in one lp.  It's a shame that they no longer sell it on the original cover and they sub it for the original back cover to be on the front (don't know why they did that)! If you don't have this cd in general, GET IT!!! <br />
B000BAQ8A0|3.0|Hay en dvd muchos 'Barberos' como para considerar este una referencia. Aunque Juan Diego Flrez sea un Almaviva vocalmente impecable, incluyendo el aria 'Cessa di piu ressistere', (escnicamente algo distante, todo hay que decirlo) y Ruggero Raimondi un Basilio glorioso y lleno de comicidad, ni el Bartolo de Bruno Pratic (sin gracia y con pocas notas realmente cantadas) ni el Figaro de Pietro Spagnoli (justo vocalmente y falto de la picarda que requiere el Barbero y que tan bien han sabido darle interpretes como Leo Nucci) convencen.

B0007PAMR4|4.0|Frank Herbert's Dune is one of the best stories EVER.     I loved the David Lynch version (included); the extended version (also included) is not directed by David Lynch. Being that it is LONGER and a little bit more intense, it is harder for some folks new to Dune to appreciate.    If you are new to Dune, I'd recommend watching the original (Lynch) version first, after reading the book of course!    The extended edition shows lots of newly restored scenes, and provides additional background and nuance to help you understand the story. Some of the new scenes are very cool -- the best one being where they show how the Fremen get the Water of Life.    However, it is 3 hours long, and it takes away the sexy narration by Princes Irulan, replacing it with male narration. I would have given it 5 stars if they had kept the Irulan narration and if they had done a better job explaining the origin of the extended version.    Even more scenes are available on Disc1 as \\"deleted scenes\\". These are also very much worth watching too! There is also a documentary that is pretty decent.    The snap case is awesome. The 5:1 Surround Sound works great.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Great album but the two new tracks are a waste. If you already own the CD minus the new tracks, then save yourself some money.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Audioslave's 2002 debut album became a somewhat unexpected hit album, on the strength of a couple of great radio hits. Nevertheless, scepticism remained whether this super-group (ex- Soundgarden's Chis Cornell with the 3 instrumentalists of Rage Against the Machine) really was in it for the long term. That question now has been answered.<br /><br />\\"Out of Exile\\" (12 tracks, 53 min.) is pretty much a straight-up rock album, with Cornell's influence clearly increased from the first album. The opener \\"Your Time Has Come\\" and the title track showcase the band at their rockingest. Radio-hit \\"Be Yourself\\" is outstanding. \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" is a delightful lil' throwaway tune. The second half of the album is actually even better, starting with a scorching \\"The Worm\\". The best tracks of the album follow later: \\"Yesterday or Tomorrow\\", with great guitar work from Tom Morello, and \\"Dandelion\\", showing Cornell at the top of his game.<br /><br />In all, \\"Out of Exile\\" is a surprisingly strong album, clearly better than the debut album. It looks like Audioslave is really growing into its own identity, away from Soundgarden and RATM, and I look forward to see where the band goes from here.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|I didn't pick up BLUE TRAIN until I had already purchased around 25 Coltrane recordings.  Because of this, I did not quite understand what all the hype was about.  I always put recordings like GIANT STEPS and A LOVE SUPREME on a much higher pedastal.  It took me a while, but now I see the sheer beauty of BLUE TRAIN. <br /> <br />Trane has an interesting band on this disc, consisting of veterans Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones, as well as the additions of Kenny Drew (piano), Curtis Fuller (trombone), and Lee Morgan (trumpet).  Except for Morgan, the rest of the group just backs Trane up.  He's no Miles Davis, but I'll take him before somone like Freddie Hubbard any day of the week.   <br /> <br />BLUE TRAIN was Coltrane's first breakthrough release.  He had already played with Miles on some earlier Prestige recordings like 'Workin,' 'Cookin,' 'Relaxin,' and 'Steamin.'  With Miles, he began an evolution that would end a decade later with his most avant-garde recordings.  In 1957, Coltrane was battling his addiction to heroin, and it is also around this time that Trane was beginning to develop his lyricism that was formulated in his stints with Thelonius Monk at the Five Spot.  While the music here is not 'challenging' by any means, the intensity of Trane's work here shows the listener an element of revolutionary playing.  We can hear that Trane was searching for a way to combine all his ideas into some type of signature sound which he would not fully recognize until A LOVE SUPREME.  What really strikes me the most is Trane's tone and intensity on this album, which I also hear on 1958's SOULTRANE.  This is most evident on the track 'I'm Old Fashioned' as well as the title track.  For a more upbeat side to the music, tracks like 'Locomotion' and 'Lazy Bird' feature highlights from Kenny Drew and Philly Joe Jones, respectively. <br /> <br />It doesn't really matter which 'version' of BLUE TRAIN you purchase...just make sure you own it.      <br /> <br />
0140177396|5.0|I am not an avid reader of American literature. Not necessarily because I don't find American authors and classic American novels to be good, but not too many really intrigue me. This is the first novel I've read by John Steinbeck, who pretty much exemplifies the American south in a way that very few authors have done with such humor, honesty, brevity, and sadness. For such a slim novel---it's less than 106 pages, and I pretty much read the novel in one evening--- it brings such an impact that makes you feel touched, moved, and even heartbroken. The main characters, George and the dumbwitted Lennie, are to me one of the most loveable and unforgettable characters in American literature. I am not going to go on about the plot since many reviewers probably have already. I just have to say that this book is quite a memorable tale about two men who have a bond that's meaningful but quite tragic. I would assume that this isn't Steinbeck's BEST work, but if you want to start off on his light pieces of work, I'd recommend Of Mice and Men. Might leave you speechless and in tears at the end, that's all i have to say. :)
B00005ATQH|4.0|How bizarre a movie this turned out to be!  Peter Sellers is masterful as the nemesis Claire Quigly.  Both Kubrick and Sellers would team up again two years later for Dr. Strangelove.  James Mason does some of his best acting work of his career as the obsessed pedophile, Humbert Humbert.  My only problem with the film is the title character, Sue Lyon.  She seems much too old for the part.  Watching this for the first time had be scratching my head and saying, how did they get away with doing a movie like this during that time period?  As was the case with the later remake, they wouldn't have gotten away with it if they made it now because of the changing attitudes of the day.  As always, Kubrick's direction is flawless.  This is an interesting time piece and pretty forthcoming for the day and age.  Recommended!
B000002J09|5.0|I needed to send this in to counter the morons who rate this 1 star.  Come on.  If this album doesn't grab you, you just don't get it.
1400032717|5.0|This is not a book that was on my radar screen; however, it was suggested to me and I decided to give it a read.  I was glad I did because this is an excellent novel.<br /><br />It's a little disconcerting at first.  Not because it starts with the murder of a dog in the middle of the night (hence, the title) which is strange in itself but because it quickly becomes obvious that the narration of this story is atypical of what one usual reads.  This is because the narrator of this tale is a young man who is autistic.  Herein lies the real power of this book.<br /><br />As a teacher I have read a number of clinical descriptions of autism.  Never have I come across a book that is narrated from the point of view of an autistic person.  And yet, from my nonfiction reading, Mr. Haddon appears to have captured an example of an autistic mind very well--the sensory overload, the inability to read facial expressions, the need for exactness, and, in this case, the clarity of mathematics.<br /><br />Granted, Christopher John Francis Boone functions at a high level in this novel and overcomes obstacles both emotional and physical that might seem at stretch but one can forgive since this novel is such a rare experience.  The character insights alone make it worthwhile but the plot is fascinating as well.  The death of the dog only touches off a sequence of events both surprising and touching (and nothing I would want to give away).  I would have been sorry to miss this one.
B000003TA4|5.0|Like my parents remembering where they were when JFK was shot, so I remember where I was when I first heard Nevermind (In Troy's truck smoking a jay after work) back in '91.  From the opening riff of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to the last breath of \\"Something in the Way\\" I had as close to a religious experience I've ever had.  This album transcends music tastes, in that, EVERYONE bought this album.  And, they listened to it front to back.  Every song.  I admit, the radio over-play kind of killed it for me for a few years but, I put the album in now (CD this time) and every song still rings as angry, depressed, and loud as ever.  Buy it.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Well, you've got the good, the bad, and the ugly - reviews, that is. Well, I'm here for not a \\"good,\\" but a \\"great\\" on DT's part. This was my very first album by Dream Theater - I saw it, heard the samples, and went out on a whim to try this \\"progressive-rock-opera\\" thing they have going on, to get a taste of something different. Well, simply put, in my *opinion* I feel I may not have bought or heard a better band ANYWHERE than this - and I listen to singers/groups ranging from Journey, to Styx, to Whitesnake, to Van Halen, to Shania Twain, John Michael Montgomery, Eagles, Queen, Sammy Hagar, John Williams/London Symphony Orhestra, Trans-Siberian Orchestra/Savatage, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Cars, Nickelback, etc. I listen to everything but rap, basically, but this group really caught my attention. <br /> <br />The one thing I notice about DT that I respect is how with prog-rock they tackle realistic scenarios and put music to them - for example, Panic Attack, the guitar riffs, tempo, vocals, lryics, and musical range all accurately (**in my opinion only**) portray someone freaking out.  <br /> <br />Well, all I can really say is, if you like any type of music and want to try progressive-rock, this is the group to sample (they ARE the only prog-rock-opera group on a major label, too, from my understanding). But, this is all opinion - only you can decide what it really is. But, I gave it 5 stars, and I loved it! Hope you enjoy it the same!
B000088E6D|5.0|Other commenters have compared Buble to Mel Torme and Sinatra, but the one I keep hearing in my mind is Bobby Darin when I'm listening to Buble.  Bobby had that insouciance and ebullience -- big words that mean he was having fun and not afraid to show it.  Sinatra did that upon occasion too, but I don't remember Torme being in that same category.  Buble has the confidence and the chops to carry off having fun with the music.  I love this CD.  I just discovered Barry Gibbs in the background on \\"Broken Heart\\", which is a bad thing about playing CD's very softly as background music -- you gotta turn this one up and rock with it for a while to discover the nuances.  Very good stuff, Maynard.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Big fan going back to the 1st record, especially loved Being There and Summerteeth.  Had tough time getting into YHF when it came out and even when I finally did, wasn't a record I would go back to much.  That all changed after obtaining a copy of the YHF demos (more on that later) and reading the statement by Jay Bennett in Greg Kot's book that he couldn't believe the songs A Magazine Called Sunset and Cars Can't Escape were left off YHF. <br /> <br />I always had trouble with the 3rd track, Radio Cure, which to me is an unlistenable dirge that sucks the life out of the 1st half of the record.  I downloaded Cars from the Wilco website and Magazine from the More Like the Moon ep which is also available on the site (and as bonus ep on the Austrailian release) and created the following running order: <br /> <br />I am Trying to Break Your Heart <br />Kamera <br />A Magazine Called Sunset <br />War on War <br />Cars Can't Escape <br />Jesus Etc. <br />Ashes of American Flags <br />Heavy Metal Drummer <br />I'm The Man Who Loves You <br />Pot Kettle Black <br />Poor Places <br />Reservations <br /> <br />To me, if this had been the released version, YHF would easily be the best record of the first half of the decade.  Try for yourself.  It really is amazing to me that songs this good were essentially discarded, relegated to ep's and downloads.  I can kind of understand leaving Magazine off since it is so poppy but there is just no excuse for leaving Cars off, it may be the best song of the whole lot.   <br /> <br />Regarding the demos, get them if you can track them down.  Facinating listen.  In some ways, kind of the missing link between Summerteeth and YHF.  Knowing where Jeff wanted to go sonically, you can see why he was disatisfied with these earlier takes.  The alternate takes of Poor Places, Kamera and Cars are just great as are the unreleased Not for the Season and Venus Stop the Train.
0783226845|5.0|Al Pacino (Scarface) won his first Academy Award for Best Actor in 1992 when he starred in Scent Of A Woman, a movie directed by Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop) and co-starring Chris O'Donnell (Batman Forever).    Pacino plays Lt. Colonel Frank Slade, a blind and retired military officer who spends thanksgiving weekend with his caretaker, a young and poor Oregon man named Charlie, played incredibly by O'Donnell, in New York City.    Charlie goes to a rich boy's school, Baird, where he is held as a witness to a disciplinary issue revolving around an incident that humiliated the headmaster, who threatens expulsion for Charlie if he doesn't tell the board who the perpetrators were. On the other hand, the other witness is a rich man's kid, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Capote), who eventually gets an easier treatment. Charlie decides to work over the thanksgiving vacation as a caretaker for Slade, whose family leave him to go out of town.     Pacino's performance as Slade strikes gold. He's vicious and moody for a blind man, one who refuses to be held at the arm when walking, but he's also lonely, miserable and in need of a good time. Charlie accompanies Slade against his will to New York City where Slade has set an agenda that includes dining in a fancy restaurant, attending thanksgiving dinner at his estranged brother's house, dancing the tango with a beautiful woman, played by Gabrielle Anwar, driving a Ferrarri, getting laid, and finally blowing his brains out.    What makes the movie engaging is the bond that we see gradually occuring between our grumpy old man and the sweet and sensitive young man, and how Slade stands up to the lonesome poor boy with a lot of integrity in the climactic disciplinary hearing scene.    Scent Of A Woman is one of the best and most unforgettable motion pictures of the past 15 years.    Recommended    A
0375758992|5.0|An incredible story.  Actually a chronological series of vignettes, the way it's constructed.  Vivid descriptions captured in a narrative flow imbued with the sights, smells, and sounds of Africa.  Perhaps the most striking thing is how there is so much familiar in lives so different from most.  The girls still went to school, the family had their Christmas traditions, and their toilets weren't much more reliable than ours.  Am so glad I found this book.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I have been a part of the Metallica Army for many years now, and when I first found out that the guys were going to play with a symphony, my heart leapt into my throat.  Being a former musician for eight years, I have a deep love and appreciation for classical music, and the overall sound of a symphony orchestra.<br /><br />Being a Metallica fan since the 1980s, I have a deep love and appreciation for their awesomely bombastic music and ability to take simple musical notes, and weave a song that hits hard and deep on the emotions.<br /><br />That said, I purchased the CD of the S&M concert, and immediately fell in love.<br /><br />The fact that the concert opened with Enrico Morricone's \\"The Ecstacy of Gold\\" was more than enough for me.  When the first bell tone hits, and the solo trumpet plays along with the swelling roar of the crowd... it's enough to give you goosebumps.<br /><br />Then, at the climax of the song, you hear the crowd scream their heads off... that's because James is entering the stage, solo.  I would have done the same thing myself.<br /><br />So, after an amazing performance of \\"Ecstacy\\", I get to hear something I didn't expect at all - \\"The Call of Ktulu.\\"  From what I understand, this was the first time the guys had performed Ktulu live.  Well, let's just say that that song is an awesome one in itself, and the addition of the symphony orchestra just made it thousands of times better... I loved how Ktulu and \\"Master of Puppets\\" were seamlessly transitioned.  It was truly awesome.<br /><br />The entire concert is full of energy, as you would expect with Metallica, and the orchestra just seems to pump them up.  It's a two-way effect.  The orchestra keeps pumping up Metallica, and Metallica pumps up the orchestra, and the fans are feeding off it all, simultaneously.  And the fans keep Metallica and the Orchestra going.<br /><br />Okay, so, after I bought the CD and wore out both discs in my car stereo... I had to see if the concert was video taped.  Thank God, it was.  I ordered the DVD immediately, and when I got it, I watched it continuously.  I loved it so much.  Seeing them live and hearing the music was almost too much for me.  I still love it.  In fact, a friend of mine borrowed my DVD, and he lost it, so, I'm ordering another one as soon as I finish this review.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Metallica, buy this CD, and buy this DVD.  If you like classical music and are open to new experiences, buy this CD and DVD.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I would give this 1 million/1 million stars if I could. 5 ain't enough.s video taped.  Thank God, it was.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I read \\"Pride and prejudice\\" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a \\"new\\" author. Truth to be told, I found a book that became one of my favourites, due to the fact that it is well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />I must say that I was a little afraid to watch this movie, due to the undeniable fact that literary adaptations can sometimes go sour. Thankfully, that isn't the case in this occasion, because the director, Joe Wright, somehow managed to capture the essence of the book. I suppose the excellent cast must have helped him in that endeavour. All the actors are remarkably good, but some are specially noteworthy. I think I should at least mention Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, Matthew Macfadyen as the handsome Mr. Darcy, and Brenda Blethyn as the kind of mother you are thankful not to have :)<br /><br />The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England. The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, the beautiful Jane (Rosamund Pike) and the second, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) who is very witty but perhaps too proud.<br /><br />The dynamics of the town are changed when a single man of large fortune, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how?<br /><br />Discovering that is likely to be fun for the spectator, unless he is a perfectionist looking for inconsistencies between the film and the book. There are quite a few, it is true, but I firmly believe that is not important if the essence of what makes \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" a classic is present in the movie. And in my opinion, it is... Highly recommended :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: Of course, if you want to enjoy this film even more, read the book too. Even though the director and the cast successfully captured the essence of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", there is still a lot you will be missing if you don`t do that.Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck.

B0008ISM40|3.0|Reznor always varies approach and style from album-to-album. Although originally intended as a concept album titled 'Bleedthrough,' it was decided to put aside the complex arrangements with layers of distortion of previous releases in favor of a stripped-down approach and a decidedly conventional song format. Was Reznor successful? Unquestionably. But is that a good thing? Not necessarily. 'With Teeth' is a very good album, but the songs are a little too \\"normal\\" for this effort to fit neatly amongst the rest of the NIN catalogue.<br /><br />I think most NIN fans wanted a release from Reznor that had a much harder edge than the previous release, 'The Fragile,' perhaps something that could musically be described as fitting somewhere between 'Broken' and 'The Downward Spiral.' Then, when it was announced that the album would indeed be titled 'With Teeth,' it seemed we would be getting just that.<br /><br />However, the album is almost completely devoid of the intense ferocity of previous works. That, coupled with the standard conventions of almost every song, led many of us to be very disappointed.<br /><br />Nonetheless, over time I've grown to like this album quite a bit. In fact, some of the songs found here are arguably some of Reznor's best work. The trouble is that the unique NIN sound, where noise is carved into melody, and unique, interesting industrial constructs are not what Reznor was shooting for this time out. He succeeded in execution with his concept for this work, but because of that, the album is just a little too \\"normal.\\" Ultimately, I question whether this work should have been released under the NIN moniker.<br /><br />Hopefully, the next NIN effort (which Reznor has said will be out later this year) will return to the brilliant originality that has made Reznor one of the most highly respected musicians of our day.
6304806442|5.0|I had taken notice of \\"Trainspotting\\" in the \\"NY Times Best 1000 Movies\\".  I got an idea that it was a bit rough from what I'd seen of reviews.  I have a personal bias against movies that go out of their way to be graphic and/or obscene.  Thus I was not sure how I would react to what I thought I would see.  I will say that \\"Trainspotting\\" is not a movie for everyone, it should be respected for its' \\"R\\" rating, and it is one heck of a movie.  \\"Trainspotting\\" will shock you with its' violence, its' view of a dead end society, the close-up examination of heroin addiction, and some of the grossest scenes I've ever seen in a movie of this quality.  Nonetheless, the movie is not guilty of any excesses except in the subject matter itself.   <br /> <br />Not long ago, I had the pleasure to watch \\"The Full Monty\\" which has a greater renown than \\"Trainspotting\\" and deals as well with the subject of the down and out in urban Great Britain.  That movie let us have fun while coming to understand a stagnant society that offered little hope of change to its' citizens.  I will admit that, although I rarely laugh out loud when I'm watching a movie by myself, there is one grossly hilarious scene in \\"Trainspotting\\" that had me laughing boisterously out loud.  Other than that, humor is not a part of this film.  It deals with an alternate solution to hopelessness; narcotic addiction.  It portrays addiction in a very negative manner while dealing with its' victims in a very humanely manner.  These people may scare us, repulse us and, possibly, disgust us but we generally are pulling for them to find a way out.   <br /> <br />I caught myself, midway through the movie, thinking that \\"Trainspotting\\" should be required viewing for anyone contemplating using heroin or any addictive drugs.  It paints a bleak picture and does so with the excesses that it takes.  There is a brilliantly disgusting scene in the worst of all possible toilets in the back of some dive.  It may turn your stomach but what you see happening there says so clearly the depravity an addict will sink to.  There are scenes that give an excellent visual concept to the withdrawals that an addict must go through to get clean again.  There are slaps of reality that let us know that there is never any complete escape from the real world.  As I saw scene after scene that stung my senses and sensitivity, I could not help but marvel at the ability of the writer and director; Irving Welsh and Danny Boyle.  Unlike \\"Naked Lunch\\", a movie that disgusted me for no apparent reason, \\"Trainspotting\\" tells a story that could only be understood this well by the approach that Welsh and Boyle took. <br /> <br />\\"Trainspotting\\" is not just a negative view of the underground world of the addict; it takes its' shots at polite society as well.  The beginning and the end of the movie involve a diatribe about all that is irrelevant in our well-ordered lives.  We are prepared to question our values in what we see yet, for me, the recap at the end made my life seem all the more relevant despite the film's apparent intent.  This was definitely one alternative lifestyle that offered no appeal.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Having been a long time Maynard fan from Tool, I didn't know what to think when I heard he was breaking off from the band to do his own side project. When I heard who would be joining him, including the Smashing Pumpkin's James Iha, I became extremely excited.  However, with much excitement usually comes great dissapointment.. usually, but not in this case. <br /> <br />Thirteenth Step is quite simply one of the greatest albums of all time period.  And I'm not exaggerating.  Each song in the album is like a wonderfull psychidellic trip.  The music is perfect, the lyrics are hypnotic, and how it all comes together is just unbelievable.  <br /> <br />Just when I thought rock music was dying with so many flaky, untalented bands filling our air waves, out comes APC to resurrect the genre.   I'll be counting down the days to their next album.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I just bought my copy from JAPANTOWN yesterday(saw the movie from a friend's AVI), and I was LITERALLY BLOWN AWAY!!I've never seen CGI so well done, clean, and the character movements and detail are FLAWLESS! I thought Pixar was good, but SQUARENIX just blew them away!! I do believe they used Motion actors to capture the movements accurately.<br /><br /> I could rave and rave about the quality of the movie, and anyway, most reviewers pretty much covered the plot, so I will get right to the point, BUY IT!! The FINAL FANTASY 7 cast are all here: Bennett, Tifa, Cloud, Valentine, etc. Sephiroth returns to plagued our heroes, in a manner of speaking. Kadaj is the real bad guy. Man, the fight sequences are so well done, the chase scene and the DRAGON is expertly animated. The movie takes place after the video game itself. Every fan of the franchise knows that FINAL FANTASY is the measuring stick for all role-playing games, now this anime feature is the one movie where all Computer generated animated feature may be judged against.<br /><br /> This movie is the true FINAL FANTASY movie, if you're an anime fan or like sci-fi fantasy movies, this is for you! This movie brings back the enjoyment when I played the game in the late 90's. I just wish they made FINAL FANTASY SPIRITS WITHIN in this style. I loved the film so much I bought the action figures based on it. I just need to buy 2 more characters and with this film, my collection is complete!!<br /><br /> Buy this movie, the english subtitles won't even bother you at all. This is a true epic anime masterpiece.
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|Donna Summer has had more greatest hits compilations than I have had hot dinners. From \\"Walk AWay\\", \\"Best of Donna Summer,\\" On The Radio (GH 1 & 2), \\"Anthology\\", \\"Endless Summer\\", \\"Journey - Very Best of Donna Summer\\" to this latest offering \\"Gold\\".    The good news is that GOLD is quite possibly the best compilation to date.  Why?    1.  The digital remastering is brilliant  2.  There are 2 CD's containing every key single.  3.  There are original versions of songs, as opposed to the remix versions found on her other compilations.  For example, this is the first time the correct single version of \\"Love to Love you Baby\\" is included on a DOnna Summer compilation.  Forget the dismal remix found on \\"Endless Summer\\". The version found on 1979's \\"On The Radio Greatest Hits 1 & 2\\" almost contained the correct version but it had a little twigging done to it to make it flow with the next song.  Other points worth noticing are that GOLD contains the promotional single version of \\"Mmarcarthur Park\\" which originally was hard to find on a Donna Summer CD.  Also, there is a decent 6.50 minute version of \\"I feel Love\\" - the only way to hear this song.  4. The CD comes with a very interesting booklet with rare photos of Ms Summer.    While other reviewers say that 1993's ANthology is a better compilation, GOLD contains most of those songs anyway.  In adddition, GOLD is digitally remastered, unlike Anthology.     The only complaint with GOLD is that there are the same amount of 80's songs as her 70's songs.  I would have preferred if they had put less 80's stuff as these were her inferior years.    Overall, a risk free purchase.  If you have any of her other compilations, you could throw them out after buying GOLD.

0143036556|2.0|While parts are interesting, the overiding message comes off poorly substantiated and reads mainly as opinion weakly supported by data. In fact, there are almost no direct references for the purported facts reported which leaves the reader wondering if much of anything in the book can be believed.  Unfortunately, when he got on topics where I have direct knowledge, he exagerated secondary drivers and largely glossed more significant factors.   This is either due to naivety  or perhaps because fact didn't fit the 'script' - or a mixture of both.  He tends to seek special cases to justify a general conclusion.  As with most subscribers to the doomsday scenario he seems to be picking factoids to support his story but isn't looking at the big picture, probably because the big picture shows his case to be without much merit.
B00003CXBK|5.0|first of all, it's really 4 1/2 stars because perfection is an impossibility. second, to all of you who think this movie is violent and gory: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.... oh, whew. ahem... ah HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!! you people don't watch very much anime do you? or you're not watching the right anime. this movie is *tame*. i repeat *TAME!* in regards to gore and violence. it's only rated PG-13 for cryin' out loud! if you want to see violence and gore watch: Akira, Ninja Scroll, Spriggan (piss-poor story, excellent animation and action), Berserk, X, hell even Cowboy Bebop is more violent and it's a freakin' TV series. go watch these shows then come back and tell me if you still think this movie is violent. 'cause if you think Mononoke-hime is violent and bloody you'll have to be committed after pissing in your pants and balling your eyes out till there's not a drop of water left in your body when you watch the other classic anime i've listed. all in all, wonderful movie: animation, character development and depth, plot (if you can't understand it you're probably too young to watch it or have come in with an already biased opinion), music, Japanese language track. the only place this DVD is lacking is the English language track, as others have stated. frankly, Claire Danes was absolutely awful as San. it brings sorrowful tears to my eyes, and gut-wrenching sickness to my stomach whenever i watch it in English (which, now, is absolutely never). the American actors completely butchered their rolls. with Claire Danes' odd, can't-put-your-finger-on-it, not-quite-right, horrid performance; Billy Bob Thornton and Billy Crudup's flat and wooden voice \\"acting\\"; and Gillian Anderson sounding like she's got cotton stuffed in her cheeks. which, i'm guessing, she does. oh and Minnie Driver who is apparently quite forgettable as Eboshi-sama. i love this movie. it was one of *THE* movies that helped propel my interest in anime inleaps and bounds. just watch it in English once so you can take in the full beauty of it and then forget the English language track exists and stick to the flowing beauty that is the Japanese language. <br /> <br />PS of course it's not for kids you freakin' morons! did you even pay attention to the rating before you showed it to your young children!? you're the reason that movies and video games get so much crap. because you take your young children to see movies and let them play video games that are clearly not meant for young children! and then you try to hide your own stupidity by blaming it on the movie and video game industry and complaining to the FCC. when there is plenty of warning and advisement against your own moronic actions and poor parenting. sorry to be so harsh, but you all know it's true. though i watched violent, R rated movies when i was a young child and i turned out TV.... um, OK. i may be a little desensitized to *FAKE* movie-magic manufactured violence and gore, you can be sure i wouldn't feel so fine if i saw the same things in real life that i've seen in movies. i'd probably puke my guts out. but other than that i'm a more or less well-rounded citizen. movies that seemed to scare many other children, i quite enjoyed and movies that i shouldn't even have been watching and probably should've sent my little mind into a torrent of insanity i sat and merely enjoyed at face-value until i was old enough to fully understand it. you're probably the ones who think The Nightmare Before Christmas is a sick and twisted, demonic, and satanic movie that no sane parent should ever show their child. well guess what! that's one of my all time favorite movies. and i probably first saw it when i was around the age of 7! i absolutely loved it! didn't have one dream *OR* nightmare about it. the two *children's* movies i remember having nightmares about are The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. though i did (and still do) like Willy Wonka.not the new one though. anywho, i'll step off my soapbox rant now. thank you. love the movie!
1891252089|2.0|Do you look like this person on the cover? If not, you may want to rethink this book. I got it as a gift but plan on \\"regifting\\" it soon. It makes yoga a game of accomplishment rather than an honest practice for normal people. Interesting Asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it, but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life, not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young Indian boys. For a different view, take a look at \\"The Yoga of Heart\\" by Mark Whitwell.
B0001VTPWM|4.0|I won't even review Robocop 2 and 3, they are bad movies. Robocop 2 is somewhat funny in a bad way and mean spirited while Robocop 3 is commercial and childish. Let's get to the goods.    Robocop 1 exists in several versions on DVD, the old, crusty Criterion Collection version with the X-rated scenes ( for violence, not sex! ), the standard MGM version which is R-rated and finally this MGM Trilogy set which also has the X-rated scenes too. The picture in this boxed set trilogy version is the same picture quality you get in the other MGM release and it is much better than the Criterion Collection, which by today's standards doesn't look so hot anymore.    One thing that annoyed me is that the formerly cut scenes are hastily inserted into the movie and some of the shots look grainy in comparison to the rest of the movie. The sound is remastered in the cut scenes, so that's good. So when Murphy is being killed, the picture quality is just like the rest of the movie but when we get a quick shot of the killers laughing, it looks grainy. Strange. It's not that big of a deal but you know, I'm hardcore about movies and Robocop is one of my favorites.    Another thing that might annoy people who are freaks about this is that the film is framed in 1.85.1 as opposed to 1.66.1 in the Criterion Collection. Supposedly Verhoeven's approved version is framed at 1.66.1. I won't even begin to explain all the nonsense about film framing on DVD, the people who know what I'm talking about already understand. It might actually work out for the best in the end if you do buy this Trilogy set Robocop instead of the Criterion Collection. Say for instance you have a high-definition widescreen TV, this Trilogy set edition of Robocop will give you much more pleasure than the Criterion Collection with it's framing and grainy picture quality.    The extras in this package, ( documentaries, interviews, lost clips ), outshine the extras on the Criterion version. If you're a Robocop fan, you might want to own both, like I do.    As for the movie itself, what else can be said? It's a bonafide classic. The film works on so many levels. As science fiction, as satire of capitalist society, as a document of social depravity and immorality, as a human story about a man who loses everything and then regains his soul. Existentialism and all that and the film even works as an action movie, a revenge story for god sakes! Peter Weller gives his greatest contribution to cinema in his noble, dignified performance and this film is not only the best American movie Paul Verhoeven directed, it's the best film he's ever made, period. Did I forget to mention the score by Basil Poledouris, wow! Does Hollywood even attempt such multi-layered sci-fi films nowadays? Doesn't seem like it!    And because the first Robocop film is so good, it really pisses me off that the inevitable sequels are so bad! They are in this trilogy set more as extras than capable films of their own. Don't worry, the picture and sound is very good in both Robocop 2 and 3.    Still, if you want the first film, uncut and looking and sounding terrific, you should own this set as it's ultimately preferable to the Criterion version.
0671027344|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing high school from a different perspective; very different from my own. I loved all the characters and Chbosky could really get me to connect with them. I recommend this to anyone in high school or above- it really hits a lot of touching subjects and you can't help but love Charlie (the main character). I also liked how there was different books and music mentioned that I could read and listen to for myself.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I am more of an old school Korn fan, and I tend to listen to their first two albums the most. It was that style that is heard in those albums that attracted me to the band's music. Upon hearing their new stuff I can only wonder where their style will go in the future since they seem to be making almost radio-friendly songs more often. Don't think that I don't like SYOTOS though, in fact, there are several songs that I am fond of. Hypocrite and Tearjerker to name a few as well as some of the interesting interludes that are played at the very end of certain songs. The interludes may be the best part actually. Most of the songs are pretty decent instrumental wise but the singing has definetly changed. There are more background vocals which I find gets a little distracting after a while and Jonathan seems to be moving from screaming to more melodic themes. With the exception of a few songs that brings back the old style this is a whole new look for Korn that is doing alright for them. This album may not be a favorite but it is still a good listen, even if it takes a little getting used too.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Even Blow by Blow was a little weak,and I had waited a long time, knowing that Beck was more then capable, this album i expected the worst, but am truely more then satisfied. This time I felt like I got a deal for the price.....Thanks.
B00008CLNQ|4.0|A quick note, the 4th symphony here is from Karajan's analogue cycle from the mid-1970's and the rest of the symphonies are digital, from his final 1980's cycle. <br /> <br />The 1st symphony here is very powerful, masculine, but it's still not as good as Karajan's greatest recorded 1st, the one available coupled with Schumann on DG Originals. That 1964 performance is just as powerful but has more warmth and the sound is superior to this digital version. You have to hand it to DG, they did a great job remastering these digital recordings but I still prefer the 1964 1st Symphony. <br /> <br />The 2nd Symphony however is possibly Karajan's greatest performance of this vibrant and sunny Brahms work. A must own! <br />Can't say the same for the 3rd Symphony, Karajan rushing the first movement and no exposition repeat, the rest of the performance is not very successful either. Then we have the Karajan performance of Brahms's 4th, which comes from the 1970's cycle. You might ask why DG did not release the 4th from the digital cycle like the rest here. No, they're not messing with your head, it's just that the digital 4th is kinda slow and would not fit on this 2CD reissue. So the geniuses at DG simply took the slightly faster Karajan 4th from the analogue cycle and coupled it here with Symphonies 1-3 from the digital one, so it all fits perfectly on 2 discs. <br /> <br />I heard the digital Karajan 4th and it's not as good as the 4th you'll be getting here, so don't worry about it. The 4th you'll be getting here is strong, very dramatic and almost as good as the famous Carlos Kleiber version and that's saying a lot! <br /> <br />This set is recommendable for Karajan fans even though I do prefer Karajan's earlier 1st and 3rd Symphonies but you will be getting his best recordings of the 2nd and 4th if you buy this 2CD set.
0671646788|5.0|This is a classic. If you have any real interest in taking charge of your life and moving beyond your current comfort zone, this is an absolute must read. At the same time, like any classic, it has draw-backs associated with age.  <br /> <br />Schwartz published this in 1959, and it has stood the test of time. These are the core principles of any personal development program. You can read newer books by Tony Robbins, John Maxwell, Marianne Williamson or anyone else you prefer, but you'll quickly see that they have built on the foundation laid down by pioneers like Schwartz. When in doubt, go back to the source. <br /> <br />A personal word, if you will permit me. I got my copy of The Magic of Thinking Big from one of my mentors, Don Baker, in 1980. I started reading it but decided it was \\"old.\\" The language was old, the examples were old, and the goal of making $10,000 a year was hopelessly out of date! As much as I trusted Don, I figured he'd dumped one of his old books on me, and I decided to buy a newer, \\"better\\" book. I have no idea what I bought, but it's long gone and long forgotten. When I finally read Schwartz sometime later, I knew I'd found the real thing, the \\"mother lode\\" and I've read it many times over the years since. <br /> <br />This is one you simply must have. I suppose there are 10,000 \\"good\\" self-help books on the market, and any one of them might be the key you're looking for on a particular day, but there are a very small number of absolute \\"must have's\\" and this is one of them. Buy it and plan to read it at least once a year. Your life will be transformed as a result!  <br />
0385507755|1.0|I found this book to be ridiculous whether it is non-fiction or not.  By page 25 I felt it was contrite and unbelievable.  This book smells of lies and sensationalism, from smart beautiful women finding him attractive in his disgusting condition, to silly law enforcement stories. The author has made himself out to be some sort of self appointed hero. It is downright disrespectful.  As non-fiction the lies are a slap in the face to anyone who understands or knows the devastation of addiction.  Not to mention families who have lost children in senseless automobile accidents. For the rest of the reading world, honest authors included, all should be insulted by the obvious lack of background research that shines through.  As non-fiction it is deplorable.  As a novel it is poorly written.  Shame on this author for preying on the less fortunate
B00009ATIX|5.0|Perception meets reality as a man comes face to face, not with his dead ex lover, but his memories of her, which are not as complete as he would like them. A nebula like planet dubbed Solaris does this to everyone in its proximity, driving many of them to suicide or insanity. Many of the reveals past this basic explanation are spoilers, which I don't want to get into here. <br /> <br />Top to bottom, one of the better movies of the last ten years or so, Solaris features top shelf acting, cinematography, directing, and a glue-like sound scheme that solidifies the focus of this \\"sci-fi\\" film set in the near future. To be frank, Solaris could be set in modern day at one of the 94 million Starbucks locations in America, and the message would be the same. The setting is merely a distant backdrop for a story that intentionally asks more questions than it answers. As it explains itself, the issues it deals with are simply too much to answer, the key is to stop looking for them and realize that frustration, uncertainty and pain are just as much a part of life as pleasure, closure and love. At issue among other things, are whether not we can be betrayed by our memories. Yes we can, at least in this film where they take physical form. and remove the ability for the protagonist to shelter himself from the truth. The \\"Villain here\\" is psychological, taking away the one form of security everyone on earth uses to preserve their sanity. He takes away their ability to lie to themselves. Definitely a universal theme, who of us isn't victim of nostalgia at some point? As a result, with the enemies of each space station crew member being a ghost from their past, the un killable character element here actually has quite a bit of weight to it. After all, the enemies are memories at first, then, doubt and confusion. This movie accurately posits that emotions have much more power than physical demons, or psychologists all around the world would be looking for new clients after each session. <br /> <br />In his best performance to date , George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin, a man who has lost his girlfriend Raya to tragic circumstances and can't seem to recuperate. In the 15 minutes used to set up the relationship these two shared, there is more depth and connection created by director Steve Sorderbergh than the entirety of most Romantic movies. IT also carries much more weight and realistic humor, matching two characters with equal intellect for their conversations. Natascha McElhone matches Clooney both in the very realistic state of flashbacks, and oddly, the dreamlike state of present day action most of the story takes place in. Patient and deliberate, but never boring, the pacing here is perfect for the material and characters. There is no room for a large ensemble cast in a story about intimacy, thus the isolation of the space station serves well to justify the low cast population. When his friend and fellow scientist Gibarean asks Kelvin to join him on the space station to try and understand the large number of deaths, Kelvin understandably accepts. His lack of attachment to anything since he Lost Raya leaves him no reason not to, especially if it offers a chance at reuniting with an old friend. <br /> <br />Sorderbergh here, not surprisingly, excels at a movie that despite its large scope seems to be more in tune with his skills, character development and well framed dialogue. Set up shots are not always the wide angle sort as would usually be approached in sci-fi movies, but often left to more grounding ones like rainfall and other more relatable sights. Any alien feel inherent in many genre movies is dissolved. What few supporting characters are present are allowed room to breathe and create their own identities. Even more impressive is the believability with which all of their dialogue is delivered. It may be a sign of decaying movie talent, but the consistency of \\"voice\\" is flawless even in the midst of discussing pretty high end concepts, from abortion to depression to God itself. It's a relief, and as a result, none of it feels condescending, if anything we feel for characters so intellectual and likeable who are unable to get past major hurdles in their shared and separate lives. <br /> <br />Sound design carries the mood of this movie, almost as much as the direction and great set design. Dialogue carries shots into each other, music is always appropriate, and the moments of real intensity are balanced perfectly. <br /> <br />original review at ess-bee.com
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have become a fan of Coldplay very recently. I will agree with several of the earlier reviewers and state that this album does take awhile to get used to. I needed a few listens to enjoy this album and I now daily listen to this album. Much has changed for Coldplay in the two years hiatus, their record sales reached over 10m, the lead vocalist front man married actress Paltrow and now expecting a baby.<br /><br />Musically the band has transformed from a softer sound to a more richer and fuller style where many songs start off slow but build gradually to a ending crescendo. 'What If' is a example of this. There are a number of candidates for hit songs from this album and 'Fix You' is one of them with great piano play at the beginning to a almost choral ending. One of the best Coldplay songs I have heard in a long time. There are 12 songs on this CD and a hidden track 'Til Kingdom Come' as a tribute to the late great Johnny Cash. It was a excellent tribute, the song Cash was working on and didn't finish as he passed away.<br /><br />With this album, Coldplay has shown that they are just as good as U2 and will be around for many years to come. If the band keeps this winning formula intact, I can see them beating U2's sales records within 5 years. The sky is the limit for Coldplay. This album is one of the better soft rock albums out at the moment and rock on Coldplay!
0440241588|3.0|This is a terrible book and a great read. Of course I'm biased-I love Grisham's stuff! This is good fun, but it's not his best work. It's as if Grisham is winking while you read, saying, \\"I know it isn't very believable, and I admit I wrote it on vacation in Italy, but you asked me to tell a story, so here you are. What did you expect?\\" At his best, Grisham is wonderful. In The Testament, The Firm, and more recently, The Last Juror, he catches the flavor of a locale and his characters become real people. At other times, however, it's as if we're all kids sitting around the campfire and he's telling one heck of a yarn. This is one of those. It's fun, but it sure ain't literature! Take it for what it's worth. Relax, kick back, and let him take you on an adventure. Then, when you're finished, leave it on the airplane or by the pool for the next person. You've been entertained on a boring flight or enjoyed your cruise, so call it even.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Despite being filled with big name, mainstream Hollywood actors, Closer is a deceivingly unflinching look at... well... [prostitute]and pimps. And even enduring at times ridiculous dialogue, the portrayal is consistently morose. For a lack of a better term the four people at the center of this film, Alice(Natalie Portman), Anna(Julia Roberts), Daniel (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen) are simply running the routine of organized, incestuous prostitution. One's opinion of it largely depends on their interest of watching an at times uncomfortably vulgar display of the underbelly of relationships. There are very few public moments to speak of, and the sex and arguments are often captured at times of cruelty or perversion.    Set in modern day England, Closer is the vignette styled tale of defining moments in time for four characters whose lives mix, mingle and match poorly over the course of several years. The first relationship is established as Alice (pimp), an American distracted by her attraction to a strange Englishman named Daniel ([prostitute]), is hit by a truck. Their `love' blossoms as a portent to Daniel's fatal flaw, his physical and sexual attraction to misery and pain. Much like the photography at the center of the story, Alice is a picture of frigid contempt masked in a beautiful face, and Daniel as a whore for misery is naturally drawn to her. Looking to leave his life as an obituary writer two years later, Daniel is being photographed by Anna(pimp) when their relationship begins. With Daniel now living with Alice, the time jumping merry go round of relationships begins as the interminably depressive Anna passively allows Daniel to become her whore. While a superficial viewing may indicate that Anna is a loose woman who has been a repeated victim in her relationships, every move she makes in this movie is of her own volition, and every relationship in some way makes her miserable enough to make her happy. Whether it be poor timing, incompatibility, or demeaning sex, everything is of her doing.    Eventually through an extremely odd meeting orchestrated indirectly and pretty unbelievably by Daniel, Anna and Larry begin a relationship. Larry ([prostitute]) obsessed with and a slave to the power of sexuality itself, serves as the polar opposite of Alice, whose veil of simplistic sexuality gives her the power of a pimp with the appearance of a whore. Eventually their relationship develops briefly from this as Larry is tormented by Alice's refusal to give him any of her sexual power. Affairs happen over the next few years, relationships begin, end, and begin again, and at last, there is a very happy resolution. Yet the great storytelling device is that as always in life things are relative to and bound by context. What is a happy ending for baseless, immoral, vulgar people may not constitute a finality many people want from a movie. What constitutes a character arc in other movies is, for people as guardedly selfish with their emotions as these, simply an arc of actions and thoughts. There are no hearts to speak of, and is it really that unrealistic that people in their 30's and 40's would have long since stopped developing as human beings? In this sense it's one of the more honest movies in recent years, although not necessarily romantic.    The negatives are limited but as everything else in this movie, glaring. The excessive vulgarity of the language - while an understandable metaphor of the sometimes disgusting nature of honesty - may be jarring as it takes away from sincere character interaction. As a case study it not only works fine but is explained several times during the movie. Lies are more `attractive' and `fun', so when people are revealing genuine feelings to one another the dialogue descends to a level not often heard outside of pornography. The correctness of the motive behind the decision does not mean the decision was correct in itself. Language without cursing can also be brutally honest and hurtful and not have such a huge deviation from the speaking voices established by the characters. Without any suggestion (i.e.these are all victims of dual personalities) it makes zero sense.    That being said the direction is relaxed and never distracting and the music is appropriately... not noticeable. The question is rarely raised this strongly in a mainstream release, what do you want a movie to give you? If you're looking for staged, exaggerated, at times silly, but in the end brutally honest relationships, this movie works about 80% of the time, down to an outstanding, logical conclusion.    Review by Steve Broome
B000005HO0|5.0|Just the way black metal is meant to be. The murder, suicide, arson, and rumored cannibalism, the things that almost exclusively attributed to Mayhem crawling its way through the recesses of the underground, and gaining relative infamy. But the one burning question ecapsulating Mayhem's material: Are the story and music proportional?<br /><br />If you're reading this review, chances are you are aware this CD contains Mayhem's most reputed lineup: Euronymous, Varg, Hellhammer, and the aptly named \\"DEAD\\" on vocals. At this point, everyone is a bit sloppy. And the production... There is none. It sounds more like a cheap tape-recording. That isn't really as obtrusive as the naysayers would lead you to believe, but if you're an audiophile... \\"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.\\"<br /><br />The album initiates with a long silence, and a chattering audience. As soon as you get the idea of fast-forwarding, Dead emmits a possessed howl, and proceeds to shriek authoritively over \\"Deathcrush.\\" The is recording is basically the quintessential Mayhem tracks, so no need to pull out a droning narrative about each song. Freezing Moon, Funeral Fog, some of the best black metal recordings ever.<br /><br />What you need to take into consideration is your tolerance of Euoronymous' \\"necro,\\" chugging guitar meanderings. This isn't technical stuff. Mayhem leans more on atmosphere, despite how many times you've heard that. The guitar sound? The solos sound like the band is battling power tools. The drums? The esteemed drum-God Hellhammer is rather mediocre on this recording, unfortunately. The bass is inaudible.<br /><br />Whatever the case, this is vile, frost-bitten black metal at its finest. Per Ohlin, A.K.A. Dead, screams his vocal chords raw, reciting misanthropic and gory \\"poetry.\\" Almost every black metal vocalist since his days in Morbid have been roughly mimicking his tortured screams. And knowing atonality kills simple music, Euronymous makes sure to incorporate a dark, hypnotic sense of melody into his compositions. Try not to get the sickly anthematic \\"Chainsaw gutsf**k\\" stuck in your head.<br />- Thus says the Pellingtonositions.

B00003CXCT|1.0|Let me start out by saying this: I am not a big Star Wars fan. I view the original trilogy as a fun, marginally entertaining adventure story. Let us not speak of the new trilogy. This review is going to be centered around the remastering, and the remastering only. We've ALL seen Star Wars.<br /><br />George Lucas may not be the egomaniacal fascist the pursits who revile his changes insinuate. But he's still ruining three great movies for a quick buck. George Lucas claims that he didn't have enough money to adequately articulate his original \\"vision.\\" (\\"Vision,\\" rofflecopter.) Truth is, most of the alterations, besides the boatloads of CGI, are superficial and are plot-oriented. For example, when Han choppily avoids Greedo's laser, and fires back. You didn't have enough money to fund that asinine exchange, Lucas? Sure. Besides ruining Han's character and further-sugarcoating the movies in sickeningly sweet censorship, you're also insulting my intelligence. Let's not mention the occasional dubbed-over voices.<br /><br />Besides those tepid, unnecessary changes... There's alot of GCI. Alot. Little CGI creatures running around doesn't make scenes seem more lively. It seems Lucas has no sense of imagination-- Out-of-place CGI raccoon monsters only accentuate the archaic nature of any special effect that wasn't tampered with. It seems cheap and plastic, just like the Star Wars universe as of late. Alot of CGI was used to add sophomoric, childish humor, cementing these films that could once capture the imaginations of all ages as mere children's movies. Changing some movies is one thing. Dulling the public's perception of art is another.<br /><br />George Lucas, you are no longer relevant. If anyone was grinding their teeth while skimming through this miniscule review, feel free to lynch me with \\"no\\" votes. Each click is a personal bombardment to my self-esteem, and $500 worth of therapy.<br />- Thus says the Pellington

1592400876|5.0|With English being battered by advertising for \\"Krispy Kreme\\" doughnuts and other deliberately misspelled words (mispelled so that they  may be more easily trademarked), grammar and punctuation are becoming mere niceties, not essentials, of public writing -- and speaking, for that matter.    Those who bray loudly in the public ear for \\"civil discourse\\" should read this book carefully before their next outburst. That way they might be able to articulate a complete sentence.    There are many influences in society besides advertising that work to corrupt the English language. Lies, obfuscation, deliberate distortion, code words of political activists, propoganda, and ignorance all take their toll.    This book is a modest antidote. It is most civil. It is correct in its assertions about grammar and punctuation. It is well-written. Best of all, the writer has a sense of humor.

In either case, I strongly urge you to get this remastered version and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br />If you're an old fan and already have the 'original' version of this CD (like me), get it and be BLOWN AWAY by how much heavier all the songs sound in their remastered glory. I always thought the original RIP was a great album, Holy Wars... being my favorite track. So when I frst popped this cd in the player, I was very pleased to hear that Dave Mustaine got it right. Guitars sound crisper, the drums are MUCH clearer and more powerful (compared to the muddled mix of the original), and I can actually hear the basslines! Not to mention some 'backing vocals' (shouts) that got lost in the original mix. <br /> <br />I'm not going to go through the tracks here as this is a 'classic' thrash metal record made better. In addition, you get 4 bonus 'demo' tracks with Chris Poland on lead guitar. <br /> <br />The only thing that some people may gripe about is that Dave re-sung the vocals on this album. I have no problem with that personally as the songs still sound great. <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you're new to Megadeth, this is a good album to start with. If you're an old fan or already have the cd (and love it), I promise you this remastered version is like a blast of fresh air, literally, and blows away the original.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The Sound of Music is a timeless classic that I first saw decades ago, long before I was married. I have again seen it hundreds of times with the whole family and everybody in the family enjoys it. It is really lovely to listen to Maria singing. We all enjoy the beautiful music and love the moving story. All the actors played their roles superbly.<br /><br />The movie is set in the period just before the Second World War in Salzburg, Austria. This DVD is about a lovely lady, Maria (Julie Andrews) who joined a convent to be a nun. She was full of life and she often got into trouble. The Matron of the Convent, in her infinite wisdom, decided to send her to a house of a retired captain from the Navy, Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to be a governess for his seven unruly children. The Captain was a widower. Maria soon gets the adoration of the children whom she teaches to sing. She discovers that the unruly behaviour of the kids was due to their need for love. Maria brings love and happiness through song and caring to the von Trapp family. Maria and the Captain soon discover that they are deeply in love. The Captain had to break his engagement to Baroness Shraeder (Eleaner Parker). Unfortunately, the newly married couple are forced to flee their country that is occupied by the Nazi Germans<br /><br />One cannot fail to be moved by the exceptional simplicity and kindness of Maria. She loves the outdoor. My most enduring picture of her is to see her singing \\"Do re mi\\" running at high speed, arms spread with children following her across a footbridge.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended movie for the whole family for its entertainment and educational value. If you run out of gift ideas, buy this DVD for someone and you make someone extremely happy at next to no cost. At the very least, you can buy one for your school library, if they do not have it.

0385474547|5.0|I read \\"Things Fall Apart\\" in my school days in the then Rhodesia. I immediately fell in love with the book because I could relate a lot with tribal life in my village and the various forces that were impacting on it. The customs, rituals and beliefs were very similar. The impact of white missionaries on the lives of people in my village was also very powerful and caused a lot of clashes with the local people's way of life. Things all around us were changing, exposing the fragility of our culture, resulting in inevitable conflicts.<br /><br />The main character, Okonkwo, was a respected and powerful village hero. However, as we progress with reading the book, he is struck with tragedies which ultimately consume him because of his inability to cope with change. This book had a profound influence on me and made me appreciate the intellectual talent within the continent.<br /><br />The book is a must read for people on the African continent where strong traditional beliefs still have a firm hold in a time of breathtaking changes wrought about by the unstoppable globalization process. The ability of African people to stop or significantly influence the pace, direction and extend of change is very limited. The tragedies that befell Okonkwo are continuing but in different forms on the continent. This is largely due to the failure to adapt to change and failure to appreciate that, however much we firmly hold and justify some of our beliefs, we cannot force others to agree with us and if we try, we will fail anyway.<br /><br />An important lesson from this book is the echoing of Charles Darwin's conclusion that it is not the strongest of the species or the most intelligent that will survive in a changing environment, but those species that can best adapt to change.
B00000612P|5.0|By far, this is the best Rod Stewart album (IMO) even though there are others that he did that have also stood the test of time. This is a CD that every music collector should have for it displays Rod at his best and some of the best classic rock music of all time (I Know I'm Losing You, Mandolin Wind, Maggie May and Every Picture Tells A Story).
B000JSI7AI|5.0|First of all, let me just say that I watched this movie once, and even though I liked it this isn't something I would wanna see over and over again. With that being said, I knew, (just like I'm sure you all did) the subject matter of the film, so I don't see why some viewers (no matter how few) act so offended by what they saw. Secondly, you must take into account when this movie takes place (time and era). Thirdly, It seems that instead of dewelling on the superb acting and storyline people are more so effected by the fact that it's about homosexuality between \\"gay cowboys\\". I guess the point flew over their heads that this is indeed a love story, and as with most love stories (except for teen movies) they all end in tragedy. It's usually in that tragedy that the person realizes what they lost. It actually took Ennis losing Jack to realize that he was the love of his life. I liked it because it was a realistic and very delicate look at love between 2 males. If I wanted to see gay guys sleeping around I could've sat at home and watched \\"Queer as Folk\\". Another thing is that people seem to be more disgusted at 2 guys than 2 women. I guarantee you if it had been 2 women the guys would've been cheering them on. Anyway, this sort of thing this has been apart of films for as long as I could remember.Let's not forget, Hilary Swank..\\"Boy's Don't Cry\\" or Charlize Theron...\\"Monster\\" it's just that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is sooo in your face. At any rate, to stay on topic, Heath Ledger made his character so believeable that he deserves an Oscar for this. Ennis' inner struggle with his own purpose, identity and sexuality is one that some of my best friends have had to endure. Prejudice is another. Jake's character Jack was also believable, and he deserves an Oscar as well. Even though I may be a straight woman, I could still relate to those feelings of love and hope for someone that you love, and only getting feelings of isolation, regret, shame and embarrassment in return. My only gripe is that I wish they would've explained the ending a lot better. I kinda keeps you guessing about what actually happened to Jack. I think they should've talked more about that. Like, Was he murdered in hate crime fashion because he was gay? Did someone else besides their boss see them on Brokeback Mountain? Did he come on to the wrong guy? I guess I just want to know..Why did they kill him? Also, I'm a little curious because at the end when his wife was talking to Ennis about Jack's death she didn't seem grief stricken like a wife who just lost her husband would. Did she find out about him like Ennis' wife did? or Did her father have something to do with it after Jack stood up to him? I had tons of unanswered questions by the time the movie was over. Which, by the way, this film was way too long come to think of it. However, you have to watch it with an open mind to like it.nly gripe is that I wish they would've explained the ending a lot better.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Can't fault George Lucas and his ability to do his own thing regardless of the \\"critics\\" lack of support in his Star Wars saga. Yes, I will agree with them to a point about the slowness of the PM but for goodness sake there is a story being told here and without this movie and Attack of The Clones being made, Revenge of The Sith would never be understood (unless you read the books). Actually, I give it 4.5 stars.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is incredible.  Almost every review will mention the 1995 mini series with Colin Firth, and who wouldn't, Colin Firth is a peach.  But Matthew MacFadyan is an amazing actor, and he has this craggy, rough, gorgeous nature.  He was excellent in the series \\"spooks,\\" Stateside it was called MI-5 and its available on A&E.com.  Kiera is a sweetheart and she shows a different side in this movie, as opposed to Bend it like Beckham and Pirates of the Caribbean, she is more intense, and she is the perfect Elizabeth.  All other characters are cast well, especially the mother.  And though Judi Dench has a small appearence she is magnificant as usual.   <br />  I was surprised at how much they squeezed into this movie.  The mini-series covered everything, and the older version from the 70's I think did a fine job at sticking to the novel quite well.  It does move fast, and perhaps if you've never ever heard of Pride and Prejudice, and you don't know the storyline, or you can't quite catch the brit. accent, you might have difficulty keeping up.  But its beautifully done, a fresh new view, with all shots blasting color at the audience.  The clothes have a traditional, yet, less formal feel...the sets are also less...itchy, less form-fitting, like the pinch of a over-starched shirt perhaps?  And Pemberly, oh my heavens, Pemberly is gorgeous, the houses are gorgeous.   <br />  This review, I gaurantee you, won't do the movie justice...see it, watch it, buy it..you'll love it.
B00005V9IK|4.0|OK, so who believes anyone could actually download (from a laptop) a virus into a VASTLY superior computer system and defeat the enemy? That's what I thought. Seriously, this movie had it's great moments also. The special effects. Very good and great to hear loud!!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Like everyone, I loved Liz On Top Of The World, Your Hands Are cold and Darcy's letter. It's really succesful work of music. But there's something I'm curious at. I want learn which song is playing during at the end of the longer version trailer? It's not PM's Love song, because this was playing during the first trailer. The song I want to learn begins when Lizzie and Darcy look at each others and the camera turns around them. After that three of them walking towards to the manor. And it continues with the words of Lizzie \\"He's so..\\" \\"So what?\\" \\"So rich!\\" bla bla =) I know this was very detailed, sorry... This is the link of the longer trailer I'm talking about:  <br />[...] <br />Thnx for ur help!
B00000G3PA|2.0|Not worth the time or money to watch. Saw it in the theater ONCE and that's all I'll be watching it.
B00005R2IS|4.0|What can I say. This movie ROCKS BIG! It is full of fighting, bad words, threats, cool heroes, evil villains, and everything else that makes an action movie good. Like guns, bladed weapons and determination. It follows a man who means to stop criminals and terrorists in similar ways to the Punisher. It has cool quotes and good graphics for a 70's movie, and I liked it a lot so I am looking forward to the sequels, Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. If you like bang em up movies with morals, see it.
B00005JOGU|5.0|Halfway thru -Capote-, a woman w/2 *young* kids wandered in.  After a few minutes' film, they walked out.  Good move, lady.  Altho there's little blood&guts, no  nudity, & no cursing, -Capote- isn't a film for the wee 'uns.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman, a tall, brawling bear of a man, doesn't play the dainty, effiminate title role so much as inhabit the role.  Whether gently charming his way into Sherrif Dewey's house [Chris Cooper, great in a low-key part], petulantly attending Harper Lee's [Catherine Keener, another terrific re-creation] premier party for -To Kill A Mockingbird-, flattering the liteati in New York w/his sneers at whitebread Kansas, or weeping as he faces the killers 1 last time, Hoffman is too too believable as the man who wormed his way into the murder of the Clutter family, only to be snagged by the tar-baby called Perry Smith [Clifton Collins Jr., chilling in *his* re-creation of both the man & the role as played by Robert Blake], who - in a better world - might have been another Capote.<br /><br />\\" I feel as though we grew up together.  He went out the back door, I went out the front,\\"  Capote sums up Smith, not realizing just *what* he's said.  Each is a mirror of the other: the articulate, manipulative Smith & the amoral, chameleon-like Capote.  The author of brittle tales like -Breakfast At Tiffany's- becomes the nonfiction write's darling w/his -In Cold Blood-, but the burden of his concern for Smith leaves him literally w/no word left to spin.  & altho he couldn't write his novel w/o the hanging at the end, Capote's involvement w/the men's execution is harrowing ... in every sense of the word...
B00004YKSD|4.0|The Doors enjoyed another boast in sales in 1991 when this movie came out, but it was a great movie despite the shortcomings that an otherwise unsuspecting teenager (which I was at the time) would have fallen for had it not been for older and wiser peers.  Jim Morrison was an otherwise idealistic follow power kid from back East who came to California (as many did at the time and so many afterwards) for fun and sun.  He was more concerned with having fun and being a spacey poet lauriet, even if it was in his own mind.  Here he would meet his love, Pamela, and get together with three friends to form The Doors.  From there, it was all a heady haze of success, fame and self indulgence.  While the other Doors took drugs with him to expand their minds and satisfy their own curiousity, Jim dove head first into full blown addiction.  From there his life would turn into a haze of drug induced behavior, arrests, and lashing out at others.  I was glad that this movie made some points in the history of The Doors that were otherwise blurred.  It was Robby the guitar player, not Jim, who wrote Light My Fire.  They made an historic appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show that outraged the network brass for saying &#34;higher&#34; on their show rather than their censored rewrites.  And there was that infamous show in Miami that turned into an outright embarrassment where he whipped it out and showed us the Ivory White Shaft.  It's not so big a deal nowdays, but back then it was shocking and offensive unlike anyone had ever done.  And Val Kilmer was a dead ringer for the real Jim!  What prevented me from giving this 5 stars was the fact that they embellished many things and fabricated many things, like Oliver Stone has done in so many other of his movies.  This Jim was really, really rude and unlikable, and I doubt even at his most obnoxiously drunk / high moment he would act so vain and self centered at all times.  Ray Manzerik said that the Jim he saw in this movie was not the Jim he knew, and Patricia Kennealy his alleged pagan lover / girlfriend / &#34;wife&#34; said Stone consulted with her on her relationship with Jim and chose to ignore her actual account of events.  The scene where he meets Nico from The Velvet Underground was not true according to many.  His relationship with Patricia was left unresolved (although that is her in the pagan wedding scene between him and Kathleen Quinlan), when in real life she would end up aborting his child.  Many women came forward claiming that they too became pregnant by him or that they had some kind of relationship (no matter how fleeting) with him, but just as many say he was a one woman kind of man.  While she did have an abortion in real life, we still debate whether Jim was the father or not.  Even his strained relationship with the other Doors was left up in the air once he left for France.  And I have met enough people who really went to Doors concerts back in the day, and they were not really these huge naked drug orgies like they were portrayed in the movie.  As I age I realize now that many tales of rock and roll excess were isolated instances or exaggerated (ex. The story about Led Zepplin and the shark) into something that they were not really.  What annoys me about this is the fact that people (particularly kids) will see this movie and think this is the truth about Jim and The Doors, then become poser wannabes based on this movie and this movie alone rather than doing their homework and attempting to know the truth.  Age sets in, we grow up, and someone gets lost on the way like Jim and joins the 27 Club.  And that's really not cool.  You think about all the things they never got to see, feel, and experience and are sad that they chose another path than the one you did, and that's sad.  But, that's life.  Still, this was a good movie.  Know to see the forest from the trees, and you will have a better time with it, but don't take it at face value.
6301966562|5.0|This movie first interested me because Bud Cort was the voice of \\"Edgar\\" (the computer).  I thought it was going to be a somewhat cheesy movie but it wasn't at all!  This movie has actually became one of my favorite movies.  I don't understand why it's not on DVD.  This movie made me laugh and cry.  Needs to be released on DVD!!!!
B00005JOFO|4.0|I have to admit that the first half of the movie didn't capture me, I thought it dragged a little bit too long, and the mumbling texas accent made me hard to understand what they are saying. Also about the whole Gay part I just have to say that I really have NO particular feelings on the subject. Which means that I don't think being Gay is wrong, bad or even unnature, nor do I think that Gay people shouldn't belong together. But when I say I have no particular feelings I meant not one way or the other, the other in this case I meant I don't feel Jack and Ennis' romance, there is no sweet twinking love feeling for me. This is also a large part of the reason why I found it boring at first. <br /> <br />But half way through I felt something, and it wasn't the Gay part but the honest feeling of loneliness. The misunderstanding recieved by people- the worst kind of loneliness, and also the feeling of wanting some thing so bad but cannot have it. This is portrayed very well and very deeply that it carves into your flesh and bone. It is very honest, and I think this movie is something everyone, whether you are straight or gay, can relate to.  <br /> <br />Also I disagree with some people saying that it portrayed gay people badly- that they only decieve. I didn't feel that at all, both men are, in a way, faithful to their wives and tried their best to be a good husband and father. But because of this unthinkable thing (during that time) that they want, they suffer for it, and torned between the voices in their hearts and the societal \\"morals\\". <br /> <br />Also I like to say kudos to both actors, they truly shone out the characters, especially kudos to Heath Ledger, I think he will do great things in the future. <br /> <br />I need to watch the DVD with subtitles before deciding whether to change my grading to five stars, hope it comes out soon!!!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I was utterly surprised in Kutcher's acting in this movie! He made a great conversion from funny character to serious character. He was indeed flawless! Great movie all around with strong storyline and great character analysis. The ending was great also, but yet kinda sad when you think about it but still a great and touching ending. Big props to ya, Mr. Kutcher!
B00008DDSC|5.0|Voyeuristic, a bit naughty, even somewhat challenging. All the same, it completely succeeds, and it does so for three reasons. First and foremost is Maggie Gyllenhaal. When we meet her she is so pretty, so endearing, and so thoroughly vulnerable that we immediately want to protect her. The next is James Spader. Normally seeing his name associated with a movie makes me want to stick hot needles into my eyes. Spader is often found in awful movies and frequently observed being awful in good ones. He exudes a predatory smarm, as though half his soul went missing. But here he is cast against type. Though playing the part of S in this S&M tango, he's victimized by an obsessive need to control and is far from mastering it.<br /><br />The demure and adorable Ms. Gyllenhaal, by contrast, intentionally populates his letters with typos to incur welcome wrath and discipline, there is strength and power in her weakness. The third is director Steven Shainberg's even-handed way of presenting the affair. Had he gone for smutty leering, or worse, broad belly laughs, the film would quickly have degenerated and become dumb and unpleasant. Instead he delivers a real, erotic yarn about two people getting what they want and need, with no one being hurt. Restraint was carefully employed and the result is a sweet, if unusual love story. That is the delightful, and surprising secret of Secretary.
0307276902|4.0|I wonder...are any addicts reading this book? I believe they are....and boy are they uncomfortable. How unfortunate that there is now something to take the edge off of the true meat of this book. That is the fact that millions of people remain crippled by addictions too varied and numerous to mention...and cannot overcome their aversion to a higher power long enough to grasp the concept that this higher power IS actually already inside them and that they have in reality handed it over to something or someone else! Of course, they don't know they have it....they've given it away!!! And they fail to heal using the traditional 12 steps. Check that fact.<br /><br />The little tiny, glistening speck (that is unfortunately now being overshadowed by other matters) that is conveyed in this book is so simple...and yet not so foreign to people who have healed from addiction while not using the exact schematic of the Alcholics Anonymous 12 Step program. 12 Steppers all over the world, don't take this as blasphemy, but you can make ANYTHING your higher power.<br /><br />Those of us who shun those nasty drugs and alcohol for our own unique brand of addiction...food, relationships, work, emotions...and our self to name but a few...are reading this book and we get it. You know why? Because we can't stop eating, we can't stop feeling our feelings, loving our partners and children, or working or working out...we have to find the REAL solution and go all the way to the core of our addiction. The point is not to simply put down the addiction. The addiction is a symptom of a deep hole in your heart. And it's trying to deliver a message that there's something rotten in Denmark! You don't have to kill the messenger. Read it and weap and your messenger will go back from whence it came. It's called going the distance and being able to stand in the mouth of the tiger.<br /><br />Bravo to James for having the guts to fight it out. James is an archetype for healing, true story or not. And while I don't condone lying, I also don't sit in judgement of the choices that other people make. I gave that up...along with my other addicitons. Yet it occurs to me that James' higher power must really be looking out for him! This higher power wasn't about to let James set this story loose on the world at his own expense. What are the odd's that he'd be given the opportunity to purify himself once again. His success can now be enjoyed from a perspective of complete honesty.<br /><br />I bought this book after the hubbub and hadn't even been paying attention to it or Oprah. This book literally called to me from the shelf. I know addicts...I know we lie....that's how I know the overriding message in this book is the truth. The other reason I know is that I, too, healed my addictions through alternative methods. It is possible. Oh and another thing....we're all addicted to something. James must know that, too. After all, he was obviously trying to do his best to cater to this society's addiction to drama as he deftly delivered the heart and soul of his message in its wake. It can be difficult to keep an addict's interest. We are masters at diversion.And while I don't condone lying, I also don't sit in judgement of the choices that other people make.

B0006IJ5PM|5.0|If you've ever been to Odessa, Texas, you know that there are more horrible places on earth, but they're uninhabited. In this wasteland, football is shoulder to shoulder with religion, quarterbacks inspire as much awe as snake handlers. If the local team ascends to state championship, Odessa will have pride. If they don't, Odessa will be left with, well, Odessa.<br /><br />This is the obsessive, semi-demented atmosphere informing Friday Night Lights, a football movie which is really more about collective mental illness and the toll it takes on small town teenagers. Billy Bob Thornton is superb and understated as the team's coach, a thoroughly unenviable job. He can't get a haircut without being grilled about the team's prospects. Tim McGraw is excellent as the loathsome former star player unable to cope with life-after-football who vents his self-hatred by berating his son for lackluster gridiron performance.<br /><br />A key player destroys his health and future prospects simply to play one more game. The quarterback is so stressed out he can barely suit up. No matter how many games these guys win, everyone's a loser and depression is rampant. The noble virtues of sportsmanship, team effort, sacrifice, and personal excellence have completely given way to winning at all costs, at times it's almost impossible to remember that these are high-school teenagers.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg could have made a supercilious portrait of hayseeds gone mad.  But the movie is actually more engaging, and more disturbing than that. It's a real and compelling portrait of a particularly American illness; the need to win, and the illusion that winning in and of itself constitutes virtue.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This CD is sssoooooooo funny and is sure to bring a smile to almost anybodys face, want a laugh as well as the chance to listen to some great songwriting and musicianship?.Look no further and buy Tenacious D's self-titled debut album today, it ROCKS!!!!!!!
0743243315|5.0|This was a very interesting glimpse into a culture I have very limited familiarity with. I certainly feel more enlightened after finishing it.  Intense at times, it was a slow thought-provoking read. The characters are very likeable, but also difficult for an American woman such as myself to truly relate to, especially the female characters timidity and submissiveness. I thought the ending was a bit anti-climactic and not very satisfying.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Great discs except that I could barely hear the dialog in the first movie. The music sounded great, but the dialog just sounded faint. And no, I'm not just electronically incompetent - other discs in this set and other discs I own are fine. So it is the disk. It looks fantastic, though. I hope I just had a lemon, and that no one else has the same problem. Very frustrating. I'm a big fan of the original trilogy, and especially love the first film (Episode IV) for sentimental reasons, though I agree with many others that The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the three.
0440237688|1.0|This book is horrible. I had to read it for an English project, and endured excrustiating pain while reading it. It doesnt have a point. The end doesnothing for the community, and just complicates the meaning of this book. Did it actaully have a point?
0307276902|1.0|As a memoir and personal essay teacher, I am put to task. My newer writing students want to know, \\"How much truth do I tell?\\" and, more importantly, \\"What is the truth?\\"  Books like this leave me speechless ... and not in a good way.  My younger students are getting the not-so-subtle message underlining all of this media frenzy and the big lie itself: i.e.,  \\"If your life isn't sensational, or HUGE, you may as well forget writing about it.\\"  Or: \\"Lies sell!\\" It will take a long time for the writing community to heal from this tremendous wound.  Shame on us all for allowing publishing lies like this to happen.

0307276902|4.0|I read this book before the controversy.  Throughout the book I thought there's no way this could all be true.  But who cares!!!  This book was hard to put down from start to finish.  It was a thought provoking, heart wrenching, sad story.  I don't think James Frey deserves to be crucified the way that he's been.  I think people need to jump off the Oprah bandwagon and start thinking for themselves.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Basically all i hear about this film was it was about gay cowboys and highly political with somekind of agenda attached to it.  Anyone in the media who has said those words could not have ever experienced true love.  For this film was nothing but pure beauty and a kind of love that no one could ever come between. <br /> <br />I was brought up in the 60's and i'm sure each of us on some level in that era has a \\"Broke Back Mountain\\" story that we've experienced.  I seem to have related more to Jake.  I had worked in the theatre world pretty much all my life where things were more open in gay life.  I also lived on a farm in Connecticut and the boy i was in love with, a few years younger than i, was more like Heath.  It was a termendious flash back of bailing hay, boy wrestling in the barn, hot sweaty sex and extreme love.  We ended up parting ways because of careers and i thought about him last night and prayed that he is doing ok. <br /> <br />I now have a partner of many many years and i'm in my middle 50's.  Are love and bond is extremely tight.  We can't live together anymore because we both have sickly parents that we attend to but we do have a home that we go to on weekends providing no disasters with our parents.  If there was any way we could have gotten closer than we all ready are, this film did it.  It was like being with him for the very first time last night after watching this film.  What closeness and the feeling of being \\"one\\" that we experienced.  Again, Love. <br /> <br />What i'm trying to put accross is, it doesn't matter if your straight or gay.  This film speaks to all of us that believe in true and everylasting love.  My hat off to the great director and to the two wonderful actors of Heath and Jake for the most convincing roll of two men so in love that you could feel each others happyness and pain.  This film is wonderful and i'm hoping it will be a classic among all ages, all people and all races.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I'm not going to rehash the plot. It took me a few days to contemplate the remarkable film, and I can only say the it's the biggest feather in Ang Lee's hat. Mr. Lee's sensitivity never ceases to amaze me, from the hysterically funny \\"The Wedding Banquet\\" (another gay-themed film), or \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" (Jane Austen as imagined by an Asian? Who would've thought...?), \\"The Ice Storm\\" (dysfunctional families abound, with great sensitivity), and, of course, \\"Couching Tiger...\\" Ang Lee's mastering of such diverse subjects, with amazing skill, must certainy rank him at the very top of our living directors. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is rife with style & focus. The beauty of the scenery is in direct contrast with the initial conflict. The gentlemen go off to their mundane destinies, which can, in no way, match the beauty of the environment of the mountain. I can't get certain images out of my head. Heath Ledger is absolutely amazing; I challenge anyone, male or female, straight or gay, not to shed a tear when, at the end, he finds the shirt in Jack's closet and holds it close. I'm glad that Mr. Ledger had this opportunity to legitimize the acting prowess that was so well presented in \\"The Patriot\\". All of the acting is, without exception, letter perfect. I still think that Jake Gyllenhaal had the toughest role, and his affection for Ennis was never in doubt. I especially liked the scene where he stood up to his big-shot father-in-law. His range of emotion was far more vast than what was expected from Ennis' character. The beautifully written script hit all the right nerves. This is NOT a gay movie; it's a film that presents an element of life, anyone's life, that under the right circumstances, could affect each and every one of us. A very sad, frustrating, brilliant film; I hope it wins many Oscars, especially Picture, Lee & Gyllenhaal. Love this film!  UPDATE: The double-disc DVD is loaded with stuff and worth the investment. I'm glad Mr. Lee won the Oscar.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I am not a huge fan of the Strokes, but I do enjoy them regularly.  This album is a step up in every category for them in my opinion...better production, muscianship, songwriting etc.  Others who were into their previous two efforts may say it's less edgy or raw, and i can understand where they may come from, but will disagree.  I feel this is the production that they needed.  If you dug the first two albums buy this one you will dig it even if the subtle changes aren't specifically to your liking.  I personally think it is their best effort to date and can't wait to see em live on this tour.  Peece.
0385510454|1.0|I was really looking forward to read Grisham's latest 'The Broker'. I felt that after a disappointing last book 'The Last Juror', I will be in for some gripping read. <br />The book starts off with a bang and one gets the feeling that this is going to be a great book. Within the first few pages, it looks Grisham is out of ideas and starts to concoct a book using fragments of espionage, romance, politics and what not. The climax is utterly disappointing and leaves the reader with a sense of emptiness, wishing that the time would have been better spent doing something else. <br />The only redeeming feature of the book is the description of Bologna and Italian cuisine. This information can of course be obtained by reading any travel guide on Italy. <br />In short, I being an ardent Grisham fan [seriously thinking about switching], would like to advise prospective readers to go for this book only if they have nothing better to do. <br />When Grishan releases his next book, I am going to frequent this site for reviews before I consider reading it. <br />Good luck!
B00005QDW5|5.0|With a band like Pink Floyd, you'll never get every cut that someone likes but this gives a great overview of the band in 2 discs. Not just the Dark Side, Wall, Wish You were here cuts but it includes the band's entire career. It especially features the Syd Barrett tracks from the early days and all of Syd's tracks are first-rate. Some bands would skip over the pre-fame days of the old frontman but give credit to PF for putting a nice chunk of Barrett material and including material dedicated to him such as Wish You Were Here and the full length Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Most listeners probably familiar with the later material but many will have a new found appreciation of Syd Barrett after listening to these 2 discs.
1558820108|5.0|Although the Saint books are definitely best if read in the right order, most of them &mdash; especially the later ones &mdash; can be read in isolation without great loss.  The present book, the direct sequel to [[ASIN:093033096X The Last Hero]], is the exception.<br /><br />Once again arms-dealer Rayt Marius is plotting to start a war to increase demand for his products, and once again Simon and his friends frustrate his major plan.  But of course, Marius has a second string to his bow, and the climax of \\"Knight Templar\\" is the most electrifying in any Saint book (and, incidentally, provides the mechanism whereby Simon is able to continue on through thirty-three more rather than spending the next forty years in gaol).<br /><br />Crown Prince Rudolf, my very favourite villain, who only comes on stage towards the end of the earlier opus, appears early here in the tale of the Desecrated Royal Toothpaste.<br /><br />BTW, the titles of ten of the Saint books were later &mdash; confusingly &mdash; changed, as follows:<br /><br />01: Meet the Tiger -> The Saint Meets the Tiger<br />03: The Last Hero -> The Saint Closes the Case<br />04: Knight Templar -> The Avenging Saint<br />07: She Was A Lady -> The Saint Meets His Match<br />08: The Holy Terror -> The Saint vs. Scotland Yard<br />10: Once More the Saint -> The Saint and Mr. Teal<br />12: The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal -> The Saint in London<br />13: Boodle -> The Saint Intervenes<br />18: Thieves Picnic -> The Saint Bids Diamonds<br />19: Prelude for War -> The Saint Plays With Fire<br /><br />The fatuity of the revised titles is nowhere more evident than with the present book and its antecedent: in \\"The Last Hero\\" the Saint does not close the case, and in \\"Knight Templar\\" the one thing he does not do is avenge the death of Norman Kent.<br /><br />P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide.
B00005BL2A|3.0|I regret to inform whoever is reading this that I was one of those faithful supporters of Depeche Mode who ignored the fairly negative backlash directed towards \\"Exciter\\", and in the end agreed with every word of the criticism.     It is true that this will definitely not appease the \\"Violator\\" crowd; almost every song relies heavily on atmosphere and texture to let its mood seep in with the listener (\\"Ultra\\" pulled this off with a finesse that has yet to be matched by their future catalogue entries). I loved the first four tracks simply because they flowed really well and boasted the fact that Martin Gore and David Gahan were still at the top of their game. They are true craftsmen in every sense of the word, but it is around track 5 that everything starts to go seriously wrong.    The first track and hit single \\"Dream On\\" kicks things off pretty well. There are no driving beats or passionate wails to assault our eardrums this time around but you can feel the creativity through the delicatley layered instrumentation. The second track is surely one to give you goosebumps because it captures the sexiness of the night much like \\"Sister of Night\\" did from \\"Ultra\\". The third is pretty good and takes some getting used to, but is instantly upstaged by the fourth track which is \\"When the Body Speaks\\". The presence of violins adds perfectly to the hypnotic flavor of delicate electronics and murmured vocals that are one of the hallmarks of Depeche Mode's sound. However, when the rest of the tracks hit, starting mainly with \\"Freelove\\", you can sense the laziness of our dynamic duo breaking through and destroying the set-up. How low can you possibly get with lyrics that tread the \\"no hidden catch, no strings attached, just free love\\" attitude (which also contradicts the anthemic proclamation of being true to yourself in \\"Enjoy the Silence\\")?  It comes off as one of the cheesier tracks that follow through to the end. \\"Comatose\\" was an absolute waste of energy and almost succeeded in putting me into an actual coma with its boring arrangement. This and \\"Breathe\\" should have been chucked into B-side territory if you ask me.           What happened with \\"Exciter\\" is that Gore and Gahan sat down and worked collectively to create something really fast in order to debunk whatever nagging suspicion fans were having at the time; that the gods of 80's melancholy were going to become lost in the emergence of the New Millennium. That's the way I see it at least. \\"Dream On\\" was heavily backed by radio and MTV alike, and Depeche Mode succeeded in wedging themselves firmly in the limelight once more despite the fact that \\"Exciter\\" failed to live up to its ironic title. It deserves a listen from anyone who discovers it, but unfortunately it is an effort that will most likely disappoint with its tired lyrics and lagging second quarter. It should be regarded as underrated at best, but it will not shine in the catalogue of other prominent DM albums when they are long retired.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|This CD is really strong, I have had it in my CD player for 3 months nonstop now and have not gotten sick of it yet. The remixes of Toxic, And Then We Kiss, and Breathe On Me, are my favorites, but there aren't any songs that I'd consider duds or that I consistantly skip over. If you are a fan of dancy music with a catchy beat and tune then this is a great CD.<br /><br />Beware of the software they install if you put the music on your computer. It has a bug that causes a security issue on your computer, which they offer a fix for on Britney's site ([...] Aside from the security issue, it is really very annoying that in order to make myself a mixed MP3 CD, I had to install this software, which crashed my normally stable computer four times before I could get all of the songs loaded , which is ridiculous. I don't use an Ipod, but if you do, you won't be able to play this music on it.<br /><br />So negative stars for the software, and 5 stars for the music itself. I hope they make a B in the Mix part two sans the software, because this one was truly awesome.
B000BCKFWK|1.0|I am probably running a bit counter to the main stream with this but really this was over the top. We have one character have his arms and legs sawn of and then he is eaten by a dog. There are two castrations and a character is killed by having his head bitten to a pulp. And these things are done by the characters who called loosely be described as the goodies.  <br /> <br />There does seem to be in a number of films a growing pornography of violence. Hostel, Wolf Creek, aspects of the 24 Hours series and this. Repulsive violence as an end in itself. <br /> <br />Now of course this does not mean that the film is not directed by someone who knows what he is about. It is not to say that the actors are less than skilled or that the dialogue and voice over are effective and professional but really there must be some point when things just get a bit gross and I think that this film has reached it.  <br /> <br />In the real world police work is a grind. Police have to painstakingly catch offenders and try to construct a case against them. The majority of offenders will commit small time offences and be stupid. Police then have to try to develop ways to catch bigger time offenders when small time offenders have tipped them of as to who is there boss or who supplies them with the drugs. This requires hours of phone taps, trying to stick up minor offenders and the like so that they will roll over and pot the big guys. Not the sort of thing that makes an interesting comic book. <br /> <br />Comic books are interested in battles a bit like the World Championship Wrestling. People dressed in leotards with some playing the role of good others evil. With comics like Superman or Batman the villians are usually caught in the act and the action is all about a fight over apprehension.  <br /> <br />To create viewer interest things are made simple. There are good guys who look nice and who we are given parts of their back story so we feel for them. Batman whose parents were killed bya criminal. Spiderman whose de-factor father died as a result of a robbery. The Punisher whose parents.....come to think of it they are all the same.  <br /> <br />Now in Sin City the technique is to have villians so bad that not only do we want their deaht but we want them slowly tortured to death. (There is one exception but that involves women who are scantilly clad and carry around guns.) Thus the villians have to be cannibals who not only eat their victims but cut of bits of them while they are alive and eat the portions with the victim eating on. Now whilst this is possible, (Said to be a Japanse atrocity towards the end of the war.) it seems to me to be a transperent plot devise to justify laothsome behavour.  <br /> <br />America is now the country which seems to think that torture is okay. That kidnaping and locking people up in Cuba without trial is okay if there is a slight suggestion of wrongdoing even if no one is sure. One can see that films like this might be either reflective of the mindset or the cause of it.
0060926317|1.0|I am going to add this book to my top ten list of Worst Books I Have Ever Read.  Too bad I can't give it no stars . . . <br /> <br />It started out okay, the narrative left a great deal to be desired and left me with the impression I was reading an article in National Geographic.   <br />It never really occured to me that what I was reading was complete bunk untill she started to describe her interactions with the \\"Real People\\".  It just got worse and worse.  Aside from being an ego trip for the author (it sounds like she loves being the center of attention!) I found myself confused on a lot of philosophical points that didn't seem consistant with what what mention in previous chapters.  I think she was also confusing information gleaned from books and anthropologists with Native American cultures.   <br /> <br />It reminded me very much of series I do enjoy reading, The Sword of Truth novels, by Terry Goodkind.  He has in idea he wants to convey and so he creates a fantasy and uses the character to portray that idea and message.  Looks like Morgan has done the same thing.  The only difference is she just can't bring herself to be honest about that fact she made it up.    <br />I'm sure that would put an abrupt end to the her lecture series and New Age fan following.  Maybe.  It is only natural for a group of modern lifestylers like ourselves to hunger for a connection with the natural world.  Even to the point, we don't care if it's real or not. <br /> <br />\\"Every time someone says the factuality of the book is not important, they are saying the reality of Aboriginal lives is unimportant.  Besides, if someone was showing you respect and admiration, wouldn't this  be somewhat soured for you, knowing that it was based on fabrications?\\" <br />-Anaussieinamerica.com
B000001XO3|4.0|The Bayreuth performances of the Ring cycle from the 1950's will never die as they rotate from one label to the next. This particular performance will have it's next incarnation on the Opera d'Oro label very soon (Feb 2006) at an exceptional price of about fifty dollars (or less if you really shop around).

B00005JNRE|4.0|We see most of the decent movies for kids (we try to avoid the real clinkers),  and, to get to the point, Nannie McPhee was a truly charming surprise. The parents got as big a kick as the kids.  Emma Thompson has assembled a wonderful group of British actors ( all recognizable -- even in the minor roles -- as major British talents from PBS series) and though a little predictable, the film got a round of applause from the audience and  left us all smiling as we left the theatre.  For the record, we have three children -- boy & girl 11-year-old twins, and a 6 year old boy.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I've read many reviews, here and in both the gay and secular press, about this film.  I have seen the movie and will buy it the first minute it's available.  Many gays just didn't get it--they don't remember what it was like in the 60s and 70s for gay people, and they perhaps didn't shed the blood and tears for the gains which give the gay community the still extremely limited rights they have now (rights which so-called \\"Christians\\" want to prevent us from having so they can show how Jesus loves us). This movie had a beautiful and heartbreaking love story, in the backdrop of some of the most gorgeous country this nation has. And for those who think the story misleads, read the letter to the editor from Stan Jakiel (he signed his letter) in the Advocate magazine, February 14, 2006.  Believe me, it was hard to be gay during that time.  Its much easier now, which doesn't mean it's easy.  See Brokeback Mountain, see it again. It shows the overriding love story of two human beings, a love which transcends gender and time, a love denied by society.  Then ask yourself why there is such a vocal faction which wants us to go back to that kind of hiding again.

B000AM4PBS|5.0|I love it, love it, love it!  Over 10 years you see the development of the characters...the growth and strength of this story is what groups of friends are.  We're silly. We're neurotic.  We play together. We have crushes and loves.  We have plans, dreams, and we share secrets.  We tease each other.  We argue and we don't speak for a while; but we're forgiving and are always friends because we love each other.  We're closer to each other than we are to family members.  These friends are who we are or were.  Each Friends episode is funny no matter how many times I watch it.  I love these characters.  There is something in every episode that reminds me of something familiar and I guess that what makes it so much fun.  This is a great addition to my collection and will remain one of my favorites.  I purchased the 10-season collection and do not regret this purchase.
0060934913|4.0|I liked this book a lot for its gritty, entertaining writing. Bourdain is a clever writer who speaks honestly about the rough, hyper-macho world of professional chefs. If you watch lots of Food Channel and think Emeril or Wolfgang Puck or the Iron Chefs represent real-world chefs... well, maybe Bourdain isn't a typical \\"real-world chef\\" either, but he seems a lot more believable. His world is filled with borderline personalities who are as fascinating as they are dysfunctional. He came up through the ranks, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America \\"back when that meant something,\\" as he puts it, after having done scutwork as a lowly kitchen assistant, and spent many years hopping between dives, family sit-downs, ill-fated ventures by wannabe restaurant moguls, and mob-run joints. Naturally, this has equipped him with tons of anecdotes, as well as plenty of advice for the aspiring chef or restaurant owner (which will be pretty disheartening until you're really, really determined and you have a very realistic idea of what you're getting into).<br /><br />However, it's hard to believe that his experience is universal. I doubt all chefs have lives complicated by drugs, alchohol, insane coworkers and mobsters to the degree that Bourdain does... then again, maybe the ones who stay in the profession really do, and that's why so few culinary school graduates wind up staying in the field. But Bourdain's experience is pretty much limited to New York, and this is as much a book about being a chef in New York City as it is about the cooking profession. Would chefs from San Francisco, Chicago, Paris, London, or Tokyo identify with Bourdain's perspective? The cuisine he talks about is mostly what you'd find in New York seafood or Italian restaurants, with barely a nod to other cooking styles. (He does describe his trip to Japan to consult on a new restaurant and promote his book, and here he gives an almost poetic flair to his tale of gorging on exotic delicacies at a hidden hole-in-the-wall sushi joint.)<br /><br />Much of his writing is poetic, in fact, though it's poetry punctuated at times with crudeness and obscenity in every sentence. He takes a perverse pride in this and even uses a section to talk about the foul-mouthed language of the kitchen and how the f-word and worse will be flung about freely, but you don't use certain insults unless you're really serious.... Again, is this universal or only how it was in the places Bourdain worked? Who cares, it's entertaining in the telling.<br /><br />Mostly this book is entertaining for the mood it captures... you can really picture cursing, sweaty chefs, busboys and servers zipping around each other in a crowded kitchen full of juggling plates, chopping knives, and boiling liquids.<br /><br />You will get some practical advice here, though, like when not to order fish and what dishes you never want to order. You might well be put off of eating out entirely though, unless you were already pretty comfortable with the idea that strangers who prepare your food are never going to do so as hygienically as you do. He also gives some (highly opinionated) advice for the home chef that led me to buy some good knives and stop buying garlic in jars. The whole book is opinionated. If you like that tone, you'll enjoy the book, though you probably won't like what he has to say about you if you're a vegetarian.<br /><br />Finally, if you think you want to be a chef, and you STILL want to be a chef after reading this book, then you just might have what it takes. I'll stick to cooking at home, thank you very much.idden hole-in-the-wall sushi joint.) <br /> <br />Much of his writing is poetic, in fact, though it's poetry punctuated at times with crudeness and obscenity in every sentence.

B00081U6EG|4.0|Ok, I agree with the other reviews to a degree. There is a moment of freezing on Paul Rogers song. I agree if the goal was to highlight the Fender Strat that there could have been more big names and more emphasis on the strat. But I bought this dvd for David Gilmour. Anything else would be cake. If you forget that this is a celebration of the strat and ignore minor technical glitches (hey this was a relatively cheap dvd) and just pay attention to the music- I found it to be quite good! I don't find the performers to be \\"bored and boring\\" in the slightests. In fact most of them look like they are enjoying themselves immensely! I'm really glad I bought this dvd. If you are a perfectionist stay away from this dvd. If you just like music of a wide variety of styles.... get it. It really is pretty good. And a live version of Pink Floyds' \\"Marooned\\" (which will be an extra feature on the Pink Floyd Pulse dvd when it is FINALLY released in September) is unavailable on any other dvd... so that alone makes the disk worthwhile.
B0000029LG|5.0|In 1995, Michael Jackson had given us his first-ever greatest hits compilation album, HIStory: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK I. This album is a 2-disc CD, with the first CD containing MJ's greatest of greatest hits from 1982 - 1992, and the second CD containing newly recorded songs, fresh from the studio. What a CD this one turned out to be.    DISC ONE: HIStory Begins ...  \\"BILLIE JEAN\\"      From the (1982) album ... THRILLER. This one is still a great song after all these years. Whenever I hear this song, I still picture him \\"moonwalking\\" across the stage during his \\"Motown 25\\" performance.    \\"THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL\\"     From the (1987) album ... BAD. What a great song. I still say those harmony vocals during the chorus are just way too awesome.    \\"BLACK OR WHITE\\"     From the (1991) album ... DANGEROUS. Still an amazing song, with a great message.    \\"ROCK WITH YOU\\"     From the (1979) album ... OFF THE WALL. Still a great song.    \\"SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE\\"     From the (1979) album ... OFF THE WALL. Such beautiful, and sad, song.    \\"BAD\\"     From the (1987) album ... BAD. What a great song.    \\"I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU\\"  (performed by Michael Jackson & Siedah Garrett)     From the (1987) album ... BAD. Still a beautiful duet. Siedah has an incredible voice.    \\"MAN IN THE MIRROR\\"     From the (1987) album ... BAD. This song should be considered an anthem. One of Michael's best songs ever.    \\"THRILLER\\"     From the (1982) album ... THRILLER. Still one of Michael's most classic songs. Having Vincent Price be a part of this song was just brilliant. Vincent Price, God rest, is one of my favorite actors.    \\"BEAT IT\\"     From the (1982) album ... THRILLER. As great as the beat and rhythm of this song, I never really cared for the song.    \\"THE GIRL IS MINE\\"  (performed by Michael Jackson & Paul McCartney)     From the (1982) album ... THRILLER. Still a great duet between the King of Pop and a Beatle.    \\"REMEMBER THE TIME\\"     From the (1991) album ... DANGEROUS. Another of MJ's greatest songs. I can listen to this one 24 / 7.    \\"DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH\\"     From the (1979) album ... OFF THE WALL. As I said before, I was never a fan of this song. But, lately, this song has been growing on me.    \\"WANNA BE STARTIN' SOMETHIN'\\"     From the (1982) album ... THRILLER. Such an awesome dance song. A song I can never tire of hearing.    \\"HEAL THE WORLD\\"     From the (1991) album ... DANGEROUS. Beautiful song.    DISC TWO: HIStory Continues ...  \\"SCREAM\\"  (performed by Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson)     The first single from the album, released as a Double A-Side with \\"Childhood\\". How awesome was it to hear brother and sister singing a song together? I thought this song was one of the best songs in both siblings' careers. Such a killer song. And how about that video? The music video to this song was definitely bad-a**. Definitely an awesome song.    \\"THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US\\"     The fifth single from the album. At first, I never cared for this song. But after hearing a few more times, I fell in love with it. Love that beat and rhythm.    \\"STRANGER IN MOSCOW\\"     The sixth single from the album. What a great ballad. I fell in love with this song the minute I heard it for the first time. Such a beautiful song.    \\"THIS TIME AROUND\\" (performed by Michael Jackson & The Notorious B.I.G.)     Never really cared for this song too much. It's an \\"okay\\" song, but it's not one of my favorites.    \\"EARTH SONG\\"     The fourth single from the album. Whoa!!! This is one powerful song, with one powerful message. This is is my favorite song from the album. Michael's vocals are extremely powerful here.    \\"D.S.\\"     A great song.    \\"MONEY\\"     Great song.    \\"COME TOGETHER\\"     This song was originally recorded by The Beatles back in 1969 and was featured on their (1969) album, ABBEY ROAD. At first, I hated Michael's cover. But aftering hearing it a few times, either listening to it here or by watching MJ's \\"Moonwalker\\" video, his cover grew on me big time.    \\"YOU ARE NOT ALONE\\"     The third single from the album. A beautiful song. This would be a great song to dedicate to your loved ones.    \\"CHILDHOOD\\"     The second single from the album, released as a Double A-Side with \\"Scream\\". Michael, himself, has said that this song was his most autobiographical and personal song he has ever written. This is such a beautiful song, with beautifully written lyrics. And Michael's voice makes it even more beautiful. This song was also the theme song to the Family / Drama film, \\"Free Willy 2\\".    \\"TABLOID JUNKIE\\"     Great song.    \\"2 BAD\\" (performed by Michael Jackson & Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal)     Another great song. In 1997, Michael Jackson filmed a 38-minute music video for a song entitled, \\"Ghosts\\". In that video, Michael sings a bit of this song, as well.    \\"HIStory\\"     The seventh single from the album, released as a Double A-Side with \\"Ghosts\\". This is such a great song.    \\"LITTLE SUSIE\\"     Great song.    \\"SMILE\\"     An amazing song and tribute to the legendary Charlie Chaplin.     As I said before, what an album this one turned out to be. This is one of Michael's best albums ever.
B000003493|4.0|You don't have to believe that any of the songs in this well-chosen collection is &#34;a pop classic easily surpassing anything by the Beatles&#34; (as the feverish CD notes by Greg Shaw state) to enjoy the energy and, at times, quirkiness of the music.  The comparison to the Beatles is apt because many of the groups here were touted as either &#34;the next Beatles&#34; (The Easybeats) or &#34;the American answer to the Beatles&#34; (The Beau Brummels, The Monkees).  The rest of the groups were &#34;the next Rolling Stones&#34; or &#34;the American answer to The Rolling Stones.&#34;  The rush to get through the door that those two bands blew open resulted in music that was by turns imitative of, suggestive of, or hinting-at-while-trying-something-a-bit-different-than what the forerunners did.  It hardly mattered that the forerunners had moved on to more adventurous music.  This CD captures the optimism of young musicians who saw that some guitars and a drum set, when enthusiastically applied backing tight (and not-so-tight) harmonies, might just conquer the world, or at least that month's Billboard charts.  When listening to the sometimes raw and awkward expressions of these groups (the proto-slick Monkees excepted) it helps to have been too young to vote when this music was first released, but is apparently not a requirement.  Cue up this CD and don't sit back to enjoy it -- get up and move.
B000AADYYO|5.0|And they deserve that honor. This album has a mix of dark piano, insane guitar work,rhythm that pounds the brain senseless melodic vocals and death growls to make satan himself throw the horns. Every song here keeps a perfect tempo and combination of soft to death metal nirvana. This album left me totally speachless and I was in awe on how this album is a masterpiece, just ask any person who has heard this album and enjoyed it. Don't believe just listen to it.
0800177975|5.0|This is, without doubt, Schwartzenegger's greatest movie. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong: I've enjoyed \\"Pumping Iron\\", \\"Conan the Barbarian\\", etc., but this has so much.  He's the hero, the anti-hero, the poker of ironical fun in action movie conventions, and he has a great supporting cast.  Charles Dance, in particular, just shines.  He's the perfect foil.
0553212737|4.0|Emma, written by Jane Austen is story about a clever, rich, and high society woman, named Emma Woodhouse. Throughout the beginning of the novel, Emma is portrayed a nave child, with a broad imagination. Due to her broad imagination, Emma bases her own happiness solely upon her matchmaking abilities. However, although Emma has the best intentions, her actions eventually lead to the worst results.  <br />Through the key marriages of Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, the theme of self-revelation through the actions of marriage is revealed in the novel, Emma. <br />Emma attempts to make a match between When Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton. However she is blinded in noticing Mr. Elton's love for her. Mr. Elton does declare his love for Emma, which leaves her bewildered. After this incident, Emma's first revelation is that her matchmaking abilities are flawed and resolves that she will no longer match-make.  <br />Emma then meets Frank Churchill. Emma soon begins to realize that she might be in love with Frank Churchill. However, soon after Emma learns of the impending marriage between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.  <br />However, soon after this event, Emma's third revelation begins to arise. Emma recovers from the disappointing event concerning the marriage of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and finds herself suddenly appreciating Mr. Knightley. Emma now begins to realize at this point in the novel that Mr. Knightley is her true love. <br />In the beginning of the novel, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a conceited and imaginative child, who lacks the knowledge of true love and self-respect. At the end of the novel, through the events of marriage between Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, Emma ironically becomes a mature and selfless woman. Although Emma's character throughout the novel changes dramatically from a spoiled heiress to a mature and selfless woman, I believe that Emma's endurance and triumph of numerous obstacles of oppression, gave her the strength to liberate herself from her stereotypically society, thus allowing her to realize and attain her own desires and dreams. <br />In conclusion, I would consider Emma a very good book. However, I think the novel's only faults are that it was extremely long and at some points very difficult to understand.  <br /> <br /> <br />
