B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is addictive, you are always trying to get to the next level.  Some of the levels are very challenging and some are relatively easy.  Great way to spend some down time!
B000FCJZUO|5.0|So easy to read and so funny. I have reread this book three times! The entire story is done by notes and e-mail messages what a great way to do a story!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We enjoy the series Game of Thrones and the DVDs so far is excellent. Only problem was I could not play it on a regular DVD player although it stated Blue Ray/DVD Combo. Worked fine on Blu-Ray.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Very good!! Can listen to the whole thing without skipping a song! Hope to see another album like this come out soon
B00DF0POXA|1.0|This guy is a joke!  I am a god? Only in your blown up head! This albums sucks by a no talent self glorified karaoke rapper! It's amazing how this Kardashian really think he's at the level of a Michael Jackson-Marvin Gaye-lol!!!! Great marketing and PR will do you wonders in this age of no talent just ask Kanye and Kim :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun to play. However, I hats to have to buy in-app purchases to keep advancing through the game.
0142501123|4.0|I enjoyed the story! The book itself was rather flimsy, which is okay, and it was packaged for shipment in a scanty plastic wrap which offered little protection, but still, I like the story, and my grandkids did, too!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I get on Spider whenever I'm bored waiting someplace.  It is great for a mental workout! It is usually pretty challenging.

1451629184|5.0|Heart wrenching at times, but well written by Ms. Dugard. She tells the story of her ordeal and it brings you into her life somewhat. Definitely a story of human strength and courage. A must read.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I had played shadow back on ps2 and liked it, it looks great in hd. I had heard to ico but never got around to playing it on ps2 and am really glad I finally did, in hd no less. great games. get this.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Stupid and boring. I removed it from my device. Pay more and more money to play this game. waste of time.
B007EC27QM|5.0|there seems to be a lot of people complaining about how this calculator does the sum total of a line of calculations. It is actually operating the way that a scientific calculator operates. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants a very, very nice calculator for a very low price!I give this 5 stars with out any reservations whatsoever.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|IF YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC<br /><br />This book is very exciting. I love to read books for adolescent readers mostly because I didn't when I was young. I collect well written ones for my library so when my grandchildren come to visit I will have plenty of reading material to keep them occupied. The book was filled with mystery and intrigue and is very fast moving. Magic has always been a great fantasy of mine and this book and this series is all about magic.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is a highly addictive game. The only fault I find is the fact that u need to purchase boosters to move ahead.
B00FQ272ZI|5.0|Directed by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call), All is Lost stars Robert Redford (his character's name is never revealed) as the lone occupant of a lost-at-sea vessel, named the \\"Virginia Jean.\\"  After awakening to find water pouring into his boat, he quickly realizes that it has crashed into a large storage container, which has been aimlessly floating in the Indian Ocean.  The incoming water damages his radio and navigation system, cutting off his communication capabilities.  Although he manages to patch the hole to his hull and use celestial navigation to pinpoint his location, he is still ill-equipped to contend with the impact of being on the ocean during a major storm.  With his boat severely damaged and lacking supplies, he is forced to coup with the growing possibility that he will be unable able to survive.<br /><br />With the critical acclaim of 2012's Life of Pi, which earned director Ang Lee an Academy Award win, someone was bound to recycle the same idea - and that someone happens to be J.C. Chandor.  Naturally, it's difficult to look at this film without being reminded of Life of Pi, since it does seem rather convenient that another film of this nature is released only a year removed from wild success of Life of Pi.  Regardless of how enjoyable Life of Pi was - All is Lost is simply better.  Not only is it better, it's far more realistic, and removes the endless array of thematic, religious overtones that caused so much discussion and analysis after the initial release of Life of Pi.  Chandor's vision introduces a real-life scenario, along with a series of free-flowing emotions that are brought out in an individual while being stranded at sea.<br /><br />It's safe to say there are only a few actors that have the skill to star in an isolated character role like this and keep the audience's attention - and Robert Redford is one of them.  Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away and Sandra Bullock in Gravity, Redford is at his very best when all of the attention is on him. From the beginning of the film to the end, the only face you'll see and voice you'll hear is his - meaning you'll quickly have to get comfortable with the idea of the absence of dialogue (aside from a few words here and there).  For an actor well into his 70s, he still clearly demonstrates his mastery of acting.<br /><br />As the film progresses, Redford takes his character through the natural state of fear, and eventually experiences frustration, anger, and finally, acceptance.  He manages to accomplish all of this by using nothing more than the simplest facial expressions and interacting with inanimate objects.  Redford's nameless character does everything in his power to prove that he (who you'll biographically know nothing about) has the desire to survive this frightening predicament.  This portrayal is so flawless that it would be the ultimate snub if Robert Redford were not at least nominated for an Academy Award.  Early odds point to him earning a Lead Actor nomination and in the event that he won, he'd be the first person to win the award as both an actor and director.<br /><br />Honestly, the positive adjectives in which to describe Redford's performance are endless, particularly because he portrays a character without any sort of back story or character elaboration.  You can call his portrayal anything from moving and emotional to nerve-wracking and gripping.  In spite of everything, his character is only as powerful as the story that has been written for him.  Again, J.C. Chandor has written this story under the simple premise that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.  Even in the brief opening dialogue from Redford, his character openly admits to whoever he's speaking that \\"all is lost\\" - so right off the bat, there's an intense tone that's been set for the direction in which this film is headed.  First, there's a gaping hole in the boat to contend with, followed by various issues aboard the boat from water damage, and then, eventually the weather takes a turn for the worst.  When the weather calms, this character is faced with dwindling supplies, and flailing hope.  One thing is for sure, you won't look at water the same way after witnessing the nail-biting course of events in this film.<br /><br />Robert Redford's acting and the story are simply exquisite, but we don't often take time to fully appreciate the special effects that go into a small market film of this nature.  Gravity was a huge box office sensation, full of spectacular visuals, but oceanic visuals are far less mesmerizing than the sheer beauty of outer space.  Instead, the chaotic setting of an angry ocean has to be interpreted and depicted in a serious manner.  Obviously, this all takes place while Redford is within a controlled setting aboard a boat that's doing much more than just rocking back and forth.  In one scene, Redford is tossed overboard and another scene his boat completely flips over, and he clearly has to struggle underwater against the water-based elements in order to get himself back aboard his vessel.  While this may not seem all that impressive in comparison to an outer space-based setting, keep in mind that Robert Redford is 77 years old.  It's not just Redford's emotional acting that makes this role spectacular, it's also the fact that he does all of his own stunts - many of which don't look all that pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, All is Lost incorporates every element that a film requires to be entertaining and emotionally charged.  This is a sobering story that features even the most realistic elements, which is evident in the fact that Redford's character, despite his thirst, can't drink ocean water due to the high salt content, and can't catch fish because of the attention they bring from sharks.  Despite the most thoughtful inventions, like the inflatable safety raft and supply kit, survival still requires a substantial amount of luck - and it's painfully evident this main character is devoid of that particular good fortune.  Much like the conclusion to Life of Pi, All is Lost has already garnered quite a bit of attention over an ending that is open to interpretation.  Obviously, you'll have to see the movie to fully understand, but this happens to be one of those stories where you (the viewer) decide the fate of the character.  Any way you look at it and taking into account the traumatic series of events that this character must endure over an eight day span, the end result is cinematically acceptable no matter what your individual opinion happens to be on the matter.<br /><br />GRADE:  A-<br />FNDNreview.coms a turn for the worst.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a great series that somehow we missed watching when it came out but we are catching up fast now.  Can't wait to watch it every night.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|WHAT A SCAM!!!!! I admit, I'm guilty for paying this company .99 cents a few times to get some extra moves to get through a level...with only 2 moves left, I would have had it! But NO, the game all of a sudden TOTALLY avoids that area of the game. Now I'm to level 35, I get through it the 1st try...and it goes right back to level 35!!!!!! I'll be darned if I'm going to pay this company more money to play a so called FREE game!!!<br /><br />Kiss your customers FIRST before you screw them over!!!!<br /><br />AVOID THIS SCAM OF A GAME!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the most frustrating fun you can have for some &#34;down&#34; time. Very addictive! Hard to stop once you start playing!
B000HF4TIM|5.0|lmaoo..I am laughing because not only was it an action movie, but it was also hilarious and easy to follow
B001DE29SS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr at about his best.  Very insightful movie into Charlie and early Hollywood.  After seeing it a few times, got this for my dad.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|I have not seen the prequel but I am guessing it is just as interesting as this one. Great purchase
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book was amazing<br />I would recommend it to people who like adventure<br />This is the book you have been waiting for
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I like the game. It's worth buying. If you can't figure out<br />some of the levels (which,  belive me has happend to<br />me before) you shouldn't give up right away even though you might really wan't to do. You should get it.
B00G9U7NEQ|2.0|Had high expectations due to Monsters Inc and this was a little of a let down. Ok for the kids
B00881VLCE|5.0|UPDATED REVIEW! I previously gave this a 1 star review in error. Disregard that review....was meant for a different jigsaw puzzle app I purchased. As for Magic Jigsaw..this is by far the best puzzle app I've downloaded. No problems playing on the 1st generation Kindle Fire. Generous with providing free puzzle packs to try and the pictures are gorgeous. A multitude of paid puzzle packs to choose from. I downloaded this and deleted it because the puzzle pieces are oddly shaped but played every puzzle app I had and needed puzzles so I downloaded it again and realized the odd shaped pieces are more challenging so it takes way longer to finish a puzzle. If you love jigsaw puzzles you won't be disappointed if you download this app :-) …UPDATE...After the developer's did an update back in the late summer of 2015 we customers have experienced a multitude of issues with missing puzzle packs, inability to restore packs, including GOLD and all INCLUSIVE . I can tell you I was just as frustrated as the rest of the customers having the same issues. Although it may seem that whatever occurred with the update that started the issues should have been easy to fix on the developer's end obviously this is not the case. I can't speak for anyone else's experiences with contacting the developer's but I've been in contact with them via email and although I still am unable to restore the ALL INCLUSIVE I purchased they do answer promptly.
B000HF702E|5.0|I'm so excited to have this on DVD. I lost my VHS tape to a flood in my basement. Glad to have it again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read the other two books. They were powerful and strong. This book is soft. It is gentle. It tugs on your heart and makes you appreciate those things of value in life. It is a story of interconnections, of the tangle that is human emotion . . . and it ends where it begins, as life does, quietly, awash in memories and love.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|Love this movie!! Happy to have it on DVD!  I did not realize that I needed it on DVD...now I do.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is the one and only alarm app that I use. I've used several others and this is still my favorite.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|I just didn't like this game because it wasn't what I expected.  I thought it was going to be a really cool mystery game where you have to solve mysteries and use magic but it's basically just an adult I-Spy.  It was actually really boring.  Deleted it immediately.
B00821OX98|4.0|Although somewhat of a cliche' basis for story, characters, plots, multitude of sub-plots and show's abilty to make the unreal, possibly real,  make it fun to watch.
0307460444|3.0|First off, the book itself is falling apart.  the first few times i opened it i could tell the binding was terrible, and after a few months pages were falling out.  There is no way to open to book flat to read the recipes while baking that doesn't result in more pages falling out. This is shockingly bad quality for a cookbook.  It just makes it difficult to read and at this point barely functional, it drops more pages every time i open it.<br />The recipes are hit or miss, some good, some blah, but I have yet to make any that end up a go to recipe.  my main complaint is the varied amount of servings the recipes make.  The cupcake recipes may make 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, or 36 cupcakes, and the frosting recipes are shown in cup measurements or shown with the cupcake recipes, basically making it difficult to know how much you're going to get.
B0094MFITS|5.0|The story and music move at a pace that gives you a chance to absorb all that is going on.
B00CHILW64|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The tsunami scenes were pretty intense.  I found myself holding my breath thru a lot of them.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Brilliant.  Brilliant writing, brilliant acting, brilliant camera work.  Just brilliant.<br />I cried multiple times during this 1st season, which focuses on the theme of whether you can ever truly know somebody.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Has an alarm, timer, stop watch and lots of choices for different chimes/ring tones to wake you up.  What I really like is that it starts out quiet and gets progressively louder. It allows you to wake up gradually instead of an ear piercing blast that almost steps your heart!
B0014JKJJI|5.0|This is my third pair of Bistro's.  I use them so much, they wear down.  In wet conditions, around grease, soapy floors, flour, etc. - these shoes are the best.  I am a bigger guy, and car work a 12 hour shift with hardly any knee pain.<br /><br />The only drawback is that the tread pattern on the bottom can get plugged up with food and other things.  They need to be sprayed off every once in awhile, while you're working.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The show is great and Jonny Lee Miller is an amazing actor.  The chemistry is between the actors is apparent.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed it! In the middle I was confused and wondered where the story line was heading, but as per usual, great twist ending.
0762434279|4.0|I grew up in the “poor dads” environment.  Even after receiving a bachelor’s degree in business, I still struggled with understanding finances and how it all works.  It took me several years to realize there is so much more to success than a steady job with insurance benefits.  Wish I had read this book 20 years ago.  Thanks for sharing your financial wisdom with us!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the first 3/4 of this book. The last part got a little predictable,but overall a great novel that I really enjoyed!
0793518326|5.0|This thing is amazing.  This thing has everything, including notation for when to play sampled sounds.  Some of the notation is a little unusual (like chord frames), maybe it is British or something, but it is easy enough to understand.  You can't ask for more detail than this.  Now if they would just do this for other bands ...
B00A285OOW|4.0|Not a very good ending.<br />I did enjoy reading the book and I plan to read the next one after this.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|It's a great show. It won't win any awards but extremely entertaining (especially for the CW) with a great story.
0061969656|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite sequels of Bernard Cornwell.  I have read all of them twice and I am looking forward to reading this one soon as well.  Amazon has the best prices of books and I always receive them quickly
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's great but I can't find the breeding guide it sucks that I can't find it but a really good game
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I love this monitor.  It is the perfect monitor for a mom like me who went back to work when her little one was only a month old.  I could watch him anytime of the day to see what he was doing and talk through the monitoring program.  When the room is dark it has night vision so you can still see your baby.  Best of all it is portable so when he goes off island to visit his grandparents I can still check up on him.  it has a nightlight, a lullaby song that can all be turned off and on from my iphone, ipad or computer. I paid big bucks but it was and still is all worth it to have access to my baby boy!  The live stream is only delayed by two seconds
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was well written and humorous.  I enjoyed reading about each experiment.  Many of them have happened in my life, and I was able to make most of them work.  Some past the timeframe, but it worked! I do recommend this book.  I think you will enjoy it, and if your mind is open, you will discover the universe smiling for you!!!!
B00ESF285S|5.0|Sometimes the best message is the most simple one- great book for every leader at any level in their career
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a great game to play I always go back to it I have some trouble with logging in to Facebook and getting the deals to show up but I still love it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this clock app not only for the basic expected clock features but also for the benefit of choosing white noise which helps me get to sleep in a too quite hotel room!!  thanks for the great sleep aid and very cool features!!!  great job!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well written script delivered by fewer than usual mumbling actors.  It usually  completes a story within an episode without too many logic jumps.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|They sent me a very used and scratched up case. Besides all the scratches, the back is also very dirty and dusty. However, this dirt or dust does not come off with a good scrubbing as I have spent over 20 minutes trying to clean it. This case ultimately seems to be used and is hard to clean. I am pretty disappointed because I thought I was buying a new case, but instead received a case that had been previously used and very scratched up. The only thing okay about this product was the screen protector.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Never thought I'd be addicted to a computer game. I am playing on both my phone and Kindle. Making it available is the best thing since $.99 gas. I'm literally playing daily throughout the day......&quot;My name is Che' and I am a Candy Crush ADDICT&quot;.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|Love love love this story!  So many relevant applications to teaching students the passion of writing in an age driven by standardized and formulaic writing.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love Mahjong and this one fits right in with my idea of a good Mahjong game. I will keep this one.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Excellent story of a significant part of Frank Lloyd Wright's life.  The research, presentation of the characters and the period of time in which they lived was fascinating.  Would recommend.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Google search is okay but I much prefer to use it on my computer and will continue to do so.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a pretty decent mystery/horror? I found it a bit over the top at times making it unbelievable, but still an okay and quick read.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|People say this app sucks,but I'm really impressed the update for my kindle turned out fine so get this app it's a good one.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I'm starting to become a fan of Gillian Flynn, her books are a bit over the top making parts of them a little out there, but they flow very well and keep you entertained. This one I liked the characters and the plot, and parts of it kept me on edge.
B005LN5UOC|1.0|This is a big earpiece.  I don't mean a bit on the large size.  I mean designed to be comfortable for Sasquatch.  When I hang it from my ear, the ear bud lands on my earring.  I'm 5' 5\\", but I feel like an elf when I'm wearing it, and an elf trying rock camouflage-colored earpieces is just a bad idea.  So after I detangled the pretend military equipment from my hot pink beaded hoops (looked like Rambo meets Rainbow Bright) I tried adjusting it.  It doesn't adjust.  It is strictly one size fits giants.<br /><br />The sound quality is spotty at times, but overall decent.  If you're one of those huge guys who can't walk into a doorway without ducking, this might be perfect for you. If you're an orc, these are the earbuds you're looking for.

B004GYY714|4.0|The only thing that falls short of &#34;perfection&#34; is that stations tend to cut out after about thirty minutes, and sometimes I have had to tune to another one. I would prefer, when listening to German radio, to be able to receive the broadcast version, but overall I am very satisfied.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I like this game I could play it all day long if I had to. U can play with friends on facebook
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|Need to rely on hints a little too much. The &#34;map&#34; is not especially helpful and it is easy to get lost.
0793518326|4.0|FIRST, this is NOT a book for folks who want to sit down at the piano and bang out some Beatles tunes.  These are the transcribed parts from the original recordings.  There are other books on Amazon that arrange Beatles tunes for the piano.  Choose them instead.<br /><br />SECOND, this IS a book for gigging musicians, but take heed of the many comments on this board about inaccuracies.  There are many small and not-so-small errors.  But for performing, you've got 95% of what you need right here.  Just let your ear fix what needs to be fixed.  (I wish some enterprising nerdish would post a PDF of the book with all the fixes.  Me, you say?  Hmmm.)<br /><br />THIRD, this is a fantastic book for sitting in the yard with a snifter or two and just beholding the wonder and majesty of the Beatles.  These tunes are so familiar now that we forget there was a time before they existed.  If you open the book to a random page, the next time you look up 45 minutes have gone by.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Still enjoy reading it. A wonderful story of the zombie war told over the course via in person interviews. Absolutely believable while maintaining classic zombie tropes.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Definitely the best Stryper album yet!  Really heavy and melodic.  Not a throwaway track on this album.  Definitely worth getting!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Really good when it works, but cuts out for 5-20 seconds every 5-10 minutes.  Also doesn't work when I have a wireless extender turned on (as nothing can see it on the network).  With the extender turned off I get great pictures via Youtube or any Chrome tab, but it freezes intermittently.  Another downside is that it doesn't stream sound with Silverlight, only the image - if I play the sound from my PC when casting the tab with silverlight in, the sound is out of sync with the picture, unsurprisingly - I bought this hoping to use it with the BT Sport website, but that's not really an option due to the above issue.<br />All of the above means I probably won't use this - hopefully there will be an update that resolves at least the freezing issue... Google?
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Munro's writing is clear and elegant. I agree with an earlier reviewer that although &#34;Dear Life&#34; is a collection of separate stories the book almost feels more like a novel, where a specific time and place is evoked through different voices. The book is a true gem and I look forward to rereading it soon.
B00DWVOPHI|4.0|The Blu-ray audio will blow your mind! It's the best you will ever hear \\"Tommy,\\" unless Pete sets up the master tape for you. The live disc is a huge disappointment. It was cobbled together from various fall of 1969 performances, and not all of them are great. This stinks of Jon Astley who should have his fingernails pulled out. I know he's Pete's brother-in-law, but man does this guy have cloth ears! The hardbound book is full of errors. Really? \\"Tommy\\" was performed at opera houses in 1979? Really?? Still, the box is worth it just for the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Three of the live \\"Tommy\\" tracks on the new box set were taken from Swansea, 1976. No wonder \\"We're Not Gonna Take It/Listening to You\\" has such a bombastic ending! The official word is they didn't have those three tunes from any 1969 shows because the tape reels were being changed. Yep, one machine. Why not use \\"Woodstock\\" or the 1969 London Coliseum show? Those tapes are already out there.<br /><br />TheWho.com is offering \\"Tommy's Holiday Camp\\" and \\"Listening\\" as free downloads from a 1969 Ottawa show they found AFTER the box set was put together.<br /><br />My guess is, they wanted the live disc to be completely previously unreleased. Parts of the Swansea 1976 show are out there officially, but not the whole thing.

B008J8KBKY|3.0|The music is futuristic, the background is like space and as someone did mention, does remind me of star trek. what I did not like was that the lines when viewed from the many different angles during game, made it hard to verify what space and line that your on, so you have a hard time in making a straight four as well as blocking your opponent.  A suggestion would be for the developers to make lines beneath opeg.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|AN  eye OPENING look at our broken legal system, and the trails one woman faced during her year in prison. Very well written.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I read the reviews and purchased this book. I was extremely disappointed. The story was drawn out and the ending was rushed.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Can be hard at times but when you figure it out you wonder why you didn't see the solution sooner.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|this game looks fun but I haven't even been able to play it for a while now cuz its still installing and it is is vexing beacuase this is my second time trying to download it
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Can I just say thank you Jen from the bottom of my book loving heart?!! This was an absolutely amazing conclusion to this series! I really didn't think I could love your series any more but you proved me wrong.  Thank you for wrapping everyone's story line up with a nice little bow (except maybe Olivia's)!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Very good story, but too many characters.  Reading on a Kindle, it's hard to flick back to see who is who!!!
030758660X|4.0|This book is full of Unique, clever patterns. There are also lots of interesting facts and tidbits about vampires and such.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|omg. finally. it came to kindle fire or on amazon but omg you have to get it I mean who cares if some other reviews say this is the game to get!!!!!
078322737X|5.0|GREAT TO HAVE THIS ON CD. INSTEAD OF  VHS TAPES I CAN ONLY PLAY DVD S NOW HAVE A GREAT DAY
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I think Bosch is a great character as good as Henry Hole. The author also makes him sympathetic so one cares very much what happens to him as a person. I read all Connelly's books.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is hours of fun very addicting, facebook friends help you to move thru the levels. I absolutely love it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love all John Grisham's books.They keep you on edge until the end,this was no exception. I hope they make a movie of this one also since I was already picturing Matthew McConaughey as Jake throughout reading the book!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Very repetitive. Not a very gripping storyline, but I guess that's the point. Wouldn't rugs to read the next books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm mad at him. I'm mad at her. He's a real freak of nature! It makes you wonder what things you can put up with and trade for others that are equally as satisfying. I'm excited to find out what happens next.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I love this game and I have always liked Angry Birds, but this is the best<br />one yet!!! It is even better than Angry Birds Star Wars. I like Angry Birds<br />And Star Wars,but together makes it AWESOMESAUCE!! And now I am<br />waiting for Star Wars VII since Disney bought it.
B0094AH3NE|2.0|I MASNADIERI  VERDI<br /><br />Sorry folks! This one's not much better!<br />The cast are quite good and the orchestra is spot on. Sound and vision is great; but the staging is off.<br />Can anyone explain to me why a group of young \\"Goths\\" which appear with Francesco while he sings his aria and do nothing but stand around having weir hair colours. WHY!!!!!!!! What purpose does it serve and as for the machine guns I am at a loss. And with all the leather outfits; are there any cows left in San Carlo??? The set (I say set as it is the same set though-out with minor changes) leaves nothing to be desired. This production is a plus on the aural side but zilch for the visual.<br />I would recommend you play it with the TV OFF, to get any enjoyment out of it.<br />Again I would recommend the CD of the work; either the Sutherland/Bonynge on Decca or the Caballe/Gardelli on Philips.<br />It's a real shame as it seemed promising in Act One.<br />I would not say don't buy it, because the singing is really quite good and the ensembles are just as brilliant. Let's hope we can find someone out there who can actually direct an opera and NOT stuff it up.<br />It costs just as much to stage an opera with taste and decorum as it does to completely wreck it!!<br />Directors leave your ego at the stage door and have some respect for the composers you are trashing.<br />I am sure that if Verdi wanted goths & machine guns in his opera he would have written them in.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A Christmas classic for our family. Helps me get all pumped up for the holiday and makes me appreciate my crazy family cause not that crazy
0060853972|5.0|If Monty Python wrote the Revelation, it would be this book. The story of a Devil who likes people, and Angel whose fashion sense is stuck in 1950, the AntiChrist,who is pretty much a normal kid and a hellhound that chases rabbits and yips....<br /><br />This book had me laughing out loud Heartily recommend it... you'll never look at the End Times so seriously again
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install, excellent performance! I have tried various ways to watch iPad movies on TV, this solved it in 5 minutes!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game for everyone. Bright colors and music enhance the experience. I defy you to stop after one game!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book drew me in almost immediately and kept me engaged throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels. One thing I really like is that it has a moral fiber to it as well conveying a very real life truth, that it is not just what we do that matters but how we do it.
B001XUYA0W|2.0|The acting was average at best, with Penn being the worst. His sad father bit was completely unbelievable. The score was very distracting as it did not fit the movie at all. The plot twist was contrived. Sure, it could be casually linked, but I didn't care. In all, not worth the lengthy time to watch.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|This one was unfunny to the last.  They should have stopped at the first one. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to renting this. Now I'm $5 poorer.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This book is a great sequel to the first book, having many adventures just like the first book. I was just amazed at how Lewis described Narnia and it's beauty. This great sequel to, \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is amazing!! Although you don't necessarily need to read the first book to understand this one. I was just in awe at how Lewis wrote this. I love the movies, so I was so excited to read this one to see how the book would differ from th  movie. If you're like me, I like books that mainly have the same things as the movies. This book is one of those. There isn't much of a difference between the movie and the book, so you'll know what to expect if you have seen the movie first. J hi y recommend this book to ages 8 and up. Love this book so much!
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Chemistry! Gosling to Carell, to stone... This is the best rom com I have seen in recent years. And I love Ryan gosling...
B00APUQJLO|3.0|I didn't hate it, it was just hard to follow and a little dark for me. It was worth the watch to see him do something outside the box.
1451666179|3.0|The author is such a talent, and it was more sad than enjoyable to read story after story of her beating herself up for being a supposedly awful person. Her 'Depression Pt 1' and 'Depression Pt 2' were beautifully heartbreaking honest descriptions of suffering with depression. But her stories 'Motivation', 'Thoughts and Feelings', 'Identity Pt 1' and 'Identity Pt 2' felt less like fully realized stories and more like circular self-flagellation that left me shifting uncomfortably in my seat. The exuberance and joy that came along with such stories like 'The God of Cake' and 'The Party' were gone - these new stories were the stories of a human being in pain. I know that Allie is getting help, and I hope it will help her realize that she is certainly not as terrible as she seems to believe.<br /><br />I have trouble scoring my review because I don't think her book should be downmarked for writing about pain. I'd really give this a 3.5 if that were possible. But I do think that the stories above were pretty aimless, and the new ones that were full stories, like 'Lost in the Woods' were not as funny as some of the classics that had me rolling in laughter. However, some of the new stories were great, like 'The Helper Dog is an...' and really, anything to do with her dogs.<br /><br />I'm happy to support this author, and I hope that she will continue to make strides in her recovery from depression. I'm sure I would buy another book from her in the future.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|it's a very interesting book, but I wish it had a &#34;trouble&#34; shooting section.  &#34;Why Amazon is short and sweet not long enough for you?&#34;  This is why I rarely rate anything!!!
B003M70O5O|5.0|Awesome series to watch for action and drama. Story line is really good and somewhat real to life.  There are some things that children should not see
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Because it's a fun game and sometimes you have to actually think how to get past a level. It can get frustrating but try to see it as a challenge.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's so fun no issues buying gems only have to play for a couple minutes breed some dragons do my stuff come back later and go again five stars
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|OK, yes, it was derivative, but it was, like the first one, a good re-imagining of a Trek classic. All the actors have settled into their roles and this time there was a bit more development, although not a lot -as the action sequences came fast and furious. Still, I've been a Trek fan since 1966 and I enjoyed the hell out of this installment!
055358202X|4.0|Like the movie series.  The book is even better!  The book is slightly different than the series and goes into a bit more detail.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|It was awesome! Just as great as his other books. Solid consistent writing. Have been recommending it to everyone I know.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It sounds kind of rude to say, but Stephen King is BACK. The last few years I've lost interest in one of my favorite authors..but this book brought it all back for me. I enjoyed the characters, the way the story developed, the suspense. So good!!
0385345054|5.0|A wonderful book for crafters, community organizations, church groups, scouts, 4H, and anyone who wishes to produce quality flowers for home décor and events. Beautifully written and photographed with easy to follow visual instructions, supply lists, and templates. I love this book!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game if you have time to waste you can easily lose yourself in this game<br />It can lag at times but nothing really noticeable
006202406X|3.0|This book broke my heart. I skipped ahead and found out what happened and I only finished it because I thought I owed the series that.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I love the new update better than the other. It works well with<br />my device. It also takes some time to get use to.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|One if my favorite shows! Walter is hilarious....you just need to get past the believability factor and you'll love it too!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is extremely helpful and well worth the download. It is quick, efficient, and it tells the user clearly what actions it is taking.
B00499NHLC|5.0|An excellent remake of a great classic set of stories. Cumberbatch and Edwards make a great Holmes and Watson. Much better than those awful movies with Robert Downey Junior.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z is not your typical &#34;Zombie Apocalypse&#34; novel.  Fans of Walking Dead may have to revise their expectations for this.  The protagonist is in no way a gunslinging hero, but more accurately reflects your average person.  The writing and average nature of the individuals involved make this more believable and, at times, more horrifying than a typical horror novel.  An enjoyable read from beginning to end.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Very well made. Good story. Good acting. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. It's a great start to The Avengers series. The more I watch it , the more I appreciate what an excellent movie it is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Got a little bored (same as second book, oh and first) with ALL the sex. It really was a good story though, thank goodness!!!!!  All in all a good series.
006202406X|2.0|I was unimpressed by this ending to the trilogy.  The story was going nowhere...very slowly.  The characters seemed weak.  During crucial moments especially they were out of character.  There were two such specific moments when Four's parents went along with what was offered to them and I was shocked--\\"there is no way he/she would go along with this!\\"  It was unbelievable, too contrived.<br /><br />Revealing what was outside the fence was not dramatic enough for me.  There was no big disclosure.  The 2nd book left a cliffhanger so that there was anticipation as to what was beyond the fence and I was let down.  It was more of the same, just unsanitary and less civilized.<br /><br />It was written in two points of view yet they sounded monotone so often that I forgot which one I was reading...which made for a boring read.  The ending felt rushed and forced as if to get a reaction out of the reader.  I thought it was going to be an opportunity for Caleb to be redeemed and that wasn't the case.  As a result, the ending was not as purposeful as it could have been.  In a word, this conclusion made the trilogy unsatisfying.<br /><br />On a more positive note, here is my favorite nonsense scene: (comments made in regards to viewing screens) Uriah says \\"I don't know, if they want to watch me scratch my butt or eat dinner, I feel like that says more about them than about me.\\"  Tris responds laughing \\"How often are you scratching your butt, exactly?\\"  Cheeky.
B002UELJUY|5.0|Great book in great condition . Not in perfect condition but I didn't expect it to be. It is in better condition than I expected. The pages are slightly yellowed but there are no tears or markings of any kind. It appears to have been on a library shelf or stored untouched for all it's 64 years. (copyright 1949) The slip cover did show some wear. Without the slip cover on it, it looks much better than the illustrated picture shown.
0061122416|5.0|This book is truly allt hat it is hyped up to be. A well written story that leaves little life jewels along the way. Or what Oprah calls &#34;ah hah moments!&#34; I recommend it!
1402775458|5.0|I read this book when I was a young boy but I didn't really remember it too well so I reread it on-line recently. It was exciting and a real adventure. I bought it for my 8 year old grandson. It may be a little hard for him to read now but he will have it for a lifetime. It is well built and well illustrated through out to really get your attention. (Having an on-line dictionary was very helpful. Some of the pirate jargon is not in my vocabulary.)
B0011UBDTK|5.0|If you're a single girl and you don't own this, i honestly don't know how you do it! This is a must own! I have probably watched this series like 10 times already and it never gets old. I got the best deal on it too!

B009K86D86|4.0|This is a very informative movie about the food industry in America. It was very informative of what the farmers have to go through with the major corporations.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|It is a great movie done by some exceptional stars but most of all it is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|this is for people like BigBrutal164. If you do not intend to buy a product then you have NO BUSINESS reviewing it. its like someone who never ate fish saying \\"ew i hate fish\\". and for the people who complain about george lucas adding things to his movie - what do you think directors do when they make a book into a movie? and ro you think remakes of movies are exactly the same as the original? wow darth vader says \\"nooooooo\\" at the end now... that REALLY ruins the entire 2.5 hour movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not much of a reader anymore, but after hearing friends say that they couldn't put  the book down, I had to read this! My inner goddess went through this book in 3 days and is leading me to book 2!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The kindle version of this app freezes frequently and I have to power down the kindle just to get it to close.  That is the only reason I gave such a low score. Otherwise the game is really cute and I can't stop playing even though I originally got it for my 5-year-old.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Who would have thought a game could be so addictive. I play until I have no lives left and then I turn on the notification on to let me know when more lives are available. I recommend this game, but I do want to warn you, you won't be able to put it down.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game good graphics really fun to play. Have only had for one day but so far so good really like it.

B005C0DHEY|5.0|A must watch for everyone. Just when I came around to the idea that Natural gas was it. It still may be great for us overall but we have to weigh regulatory environment vs profit motive vs public safety. I am not a tree hugger, I'm not a dyed in the wool GOP'er either. Just a centrist. This film raises some serious questions that need to be addressed. I'm fortunate that living in Chicago means there's no natural gas shale nearby to explore. I'd always though the wells were safe and that may have been a little naive. However this film portrays all wells as hazards and I don't think that's the case either. In my opinion clearly the wells are not completely &#34;safe&#34; but I believe that natural gas should be able to be procured safely. This is an important film in that we all need to open our eyes that maybe propane isn't perfect and maybe just a little bit more research needs to be done.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I really think they earn a five star because the h.d is really good and it's just amazing I love it

B0030B624E|5.0|So funny and original. It also had it's emotional moments. Woody was the best part of this movie, and it was also Emma stone's first standout role. Loved it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham is probably the only novelist in America today who can get away with basing a novel on a probate court case. If you're tired of the traditional courtroom thrillers with murderers or corporate bad guys, relax you are about to enter the strange world of estates, wills and yes probate court when your read Sycamore Row. In my years covering court cases as a journalist, I may have sat through one probate case and quickly found myself falling asleep. However, Grisham not only manages to keep me awake, he weaves a story with colorful characters and a decent plot.<br /><br />I'm not about to spoil the ending but I suspect many readers will see it coming long before the final chapters. This is an excellent book but I was somewhat disappointed by a couple Grisham writing techniques that detract from the book. For example, in the final chapters all the major characters - except the jurors - know the ultimate twist in the plot. This does build suspense, but it's not an honest way to develop a plot, at least in my opinion. If the novel were from a juror's perspective, it would be understandable. However, most chapters are from the perspective of the protagonist, Jake Brigance. Throughout the novel, Grisham allows us to see the case through Brigance's eyes. In the final chapters he does not allow us to share in the information critical to the outcome of the case.  In addition, the author sometimes disregards point of view in certain chapters throughout the novel. He adds information that the particular point of view character in the chapter could not possibly know. This probably bothers few other readers, but it did somewhat disrupt the flow of the novel for me.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Sycamore Row is a very good read that captures the flavor of the South in a bygone era while making a strong statement about its nefarious past. It is well worth a reader's time. Read it before it becomes a movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow… what a great book! This is one of the best book I have ever red. I very highly recommend this book to anyone who likes sci-fi, action, or war books. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|One of Dylan's best. The instrumentation, usually with a constant, repetitive beat, holds you captive to the vocals which almost always have a moral. Although Tempest, an eight minute story in song about the sinking of the Titanic, is the featured track, the one that steals the show, in my opinion, is Roll On John, the CDs final track.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|A well-written mystery that has kept me 'hooked' all the way through.  Believable characters and story line.  What else could it be when it won the Man Booker Prize?  However, it has my approval as well.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Re-reading it, slowly, for the first time in maybe 50 years or more, I was surprised at the beauty of the writing,  Being a Californian, I particularly enjoyed the passages describing the Salinas valley, and the way of life there around the turn of the last century.  Some characters were more plausible than others, but all were interesting.  I think I need to re-read more of Steinbeck's works.
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|This is not only my favorite movie but my lil child's as well. we like to lay around and watch this together. If you haven't watched it, you dont know what your missing out on.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book. I have ever since i first read it and every now and than I will pop it out just to re-read and get lost in another world. I don't know why there is a sudden influx of bad reviews? Maybe it's some bookclub on a tear??? But I can only tell you what I FELT while reading it.<br /><br />I love getting lost in a book, so lost that world ceases to exist, my problems are gone, chores needed to be done are forgotten and my mind is in another world where I'm caught up in fictional drama as opposed to the depressing stuff we see every night on the news.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster - I move to a different world. I loved the excitement, the drama, the fact that I hated some bits. It makes me feel emotion for the couple, for those around them & the situations surrounding. I have to admit Abby annoyed the hell out of me sometimes. She is messed up and confused, a little too conscious of what others think of her and a bit judgmental. Travis is the sexy bad oh everyone wants to either screw or be. Such an opposite sounding couple you don't know why they work, but they do.<br /><br />Just at least borrow the book or read a sample. Don't base what over some other peoples reviews. I wish I could see what kind of books that person read so I could see if we had similar tastes in books ...... Probably not. But to take one persons view of things which  with some I disagree. I love how some reviewers nit picked on certain parts without explaining the build up or circumstances surrounding that detail. Read it!!

B009CF7JDU|3.0|Amusing and well made, but a little tame compared to more recent films of the &#34;naughty schoolboy&#34; variety. You should see it so Amazon Prime is a good alternative.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Sure, it's basically a hundred bucks for a bunch of painted plastic. However, my husband and I consider this toy an investment and the ticket to an early retirement as we are planning on our daughter funding our later years from her winnings in professional sports. Our six-month-old has been on a strict training regiment for the past two months of  three hours of jumping a day and we are confident that another few years of this will translate into millions of dollars in endorsements when she becomes an Olympic high jumper, or perhaps the youngest female to dunk a basketball. At the very least, she has developed some practical skills as she can now easily jump into her highchair. Five Stars. Boom.

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Patricia Cornwell's 21st novel Dust is a return to all the things that made the Scarpetta series great.<br /><br />As with past books Cornwell subtly and smoothly incorporates current technology into the storyline.  The reader is given a taste of this in Dust when a droid cell phone mixes into the crime scene and when Scarpetta uses cutting edge technology to autopsy the victim - technologies that may seem far-fetched to readers but that are actually currently being used in real life.<br /><br />The plot is an intricate web of Scarpetta, Benton, Lucy and Marino working to solve the crime as FBI hands of corruption reach out and try to stop the wheels of justice.  This brings Benton into the foreground and we get a glimpse into his world as he struggles to work against the FBI and solve the case at hand.<br /><br />Nothing is left out in Dust and character relationships are again at the forefront of this book.  Marino's new position has shifted the dynamics between him and other characters making everyone cautious around him.  Lucy is her usual strong-willed self and this time becomes embroiled in the case at hand.  And Cornwell finally reveals more information about Scarpetta's husband Benton Wesley.  The reader now sees a new depth to Benton, has a better understanding of how he works and ultimately gains insight about his important role in Scarpetta's life. (I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of Dust.)  Scarpetta is more like she was in the earlier books of the series and drives the story forward. Strong-willed, independent minded and protective of her family and friends, she carefully yet deliberately works the crime scene, slowly sorting through all the clues which ultimately leads to the case being solved.<br /><br />As I like to give a balanced review I will mention that in a couple of spots I felt the story slowed down a little bit - but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed Dust. It even had the added surprises of Scarpetta revealing secrets from her past and of meeting her mother.  If you are a fan of the Scarpetta series this one will hit the spot!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing x100. I absolutely loved it. The best book ever. I love how the rebellion is starting to happen and can't wait to see if it works in book 3.
1401201911|1.0|The greatest blunder in comics in a long time, Such a interesting premise squandered by a lazy writing. What could have being  a interesting character study in nurture versus nature and  completely role reversal of a icon , squandered..Superman is raised by Stalin and magically is the same  superman  in terms of character raised by the Kent's. If one was raised by a mass murderer you would think it effect ones character. And don't get me started on  Batman's idiot cameo.{with the stupid hat} . Russia under Stalin was one of  histories darkest times, and it feels that writers grasp of world history was lacking.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as creative and surprising as Hunger Games, but still an interesting read for Fans! Spoiler Alert: the sudden appearance of a certain District will need some historical justification.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've made my own rain combo with this thing, and I sleep to it most nights. Turns itself off with a timer.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is amazing. I love hazels realism and angst ridden rebuttals in terms of her disease. The characters come off as legitimate people whereas in other books I seem to feel the characters come off as disingenuous. Great book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter loves this game:) It was a must to download the game. I would definitely recommend everyone to try it!
B007AL48UK|3.0|its ok another Mahjong clone so if that is you thing go for it have fun with this clone is ok
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I believe that this may be the best book I have ever read. A great idea to have death be the narrator. The language is beautiful.
B00479SVBU|5.0|1ST UNIT WORKED BUT REMOTE DIDN'T, CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SENT NEW REMOTE RIGHT AWAY. 2CND REMOTE ALSO DID NOT FUNCTION, THEY SENT WHOLE NEW UNIT! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE THE UNIT IS THE BEST!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|candy crush is fun. great when you time to kill. I just wish it would incorporate some mini games so that players could try to earn additional lives. It can be upsetting when you are one move away and ready to try again but have to wait Thirty minutes or ask friends if.you are connected to facebook. overall it is a emjoyable game.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is one of the best games to play. Adults as well as kids.  It's easy to learn how to play it. The levels are enjoyable and help relieve stress.
0804137501|5.0|Another great book by the 37signals team! I was always on the fence about remote working because of my previous bad experiences, but Jason and crew have opened my eyes to the benefits by sharing tested practices. I will be implementing some of their ideas now.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Great light history.  When a newspaper in a movie came spinning out of nowhere carrying a lurid headline like, &#34;Marlowe Arrested for Murder&#34;, I have always been one to look past the headline to the &#34;other&#34; stories also on that page,  Such, it seems is with this book.  WE all know about Lindbergh, but not about Nungesser, or Byrd, or others...this fills in the gaps.  I never knew that Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig disliked each other because Ruth, allegedly, slept with Gehrig's wife.  Guess I'll never view &#34;Pride of the Yankees&#34; the same way again.<br /><br />This book is a good, fast, entertaining read.  Filled with the footnotes of history as well as the major stories...who were the Von Swerigans again?  Pick it up...it's like trying to eat just one potato chip.
B003L5HLSA|3.0|I bought this MP3. While I was listening, I noticed it bleeped out words. I did not click on the edited version!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard but not too easy.  I keep a scratch pad by my kindle to keep track of all the clues.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|In many ways it was a far cry from P. K. Dick's vision of &#34;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&#34; but nonetheless the best movie Ridley Scott has directed to date (with Alien a close second) . The transfer to Blu Ray was wonderful for all the versions of the film and Edward James Olmos' character is annoying as he is really creepy. One can't help but feel sympathy for the replicants and Rutger Hauer's last scene was poignant and touching. Less reassuring was Scott's future conception of the earth as a polluted wasteland devasted by greenhouse gases. I'm glad I won't be around to see that. in any case buy this collection.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Not much to it.  Would not recommend it.  Seemed to ramble and all the traveling back and forth seemed pointless.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The first two movies were great with the original being the best but as for the rest of the releases they all went downhill beginning with the third installment. The transfer to Blu Ray for all the films. however, was simply stunning. Well worth the price of admission.
B000O59AFC|2.0|The worst of the MI films. Had some good action sequences but the plot could've been more sound and suspenseful.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It really is one of The best books I have read and I envy the author for his skill. Darcy baker
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Bam!!  This is another 100 star movie.  Totally engaging and hilarious.  Can't help but love these characters.  Especially the Hulk!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Highly recommend this book...  I can see why Brad Pitt fought for the movie to be made. After watching the movie I knew there was more to the story. It was all I was looking for. And really scares me to death! I can see it happening...
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|THIS WAS THE BEST EVER!!  No words can describe the action, visuals or concept of this movie except for these: Watch this MOVIE!
B004ZQBOK0|4.0|I bought this as a christmas gift. I don't listen to this particular band. I'm just hoping she doesn't have it yet.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This was an exceptionally engaging, nostalgic drama that kept you watching and feeling and pondering what it took to get where we are.

B00FEN1C50|5.0|Over the edge in action.  This was great and mesmerizing with the giant (robotics).  A different angle on Robotics and sci-fi.
0062073567|5.0|A small village where everyone knows everyone and then there is a death of one Mrs Ferrars. Although attributed to an overdose of veronal, people suspect that she committed suicide because of guilt. According to rumors and widespread suspicions,<br />Mrs Ferrars had supposedly poisoned her husband, who died just over a year ago. But there was never any proof to prove any of this.<br /><br />While people are digesting these shady circumstances, Roger Ackroyd, a very close friend of Mrs Ferrars is found dead in his study with the door locked from inside and a letter missing which was speculated to have been sent by Mrs Ferrars before her death and contained the name of the person blackmailing her. This blackmailer claimed to know all about her act of killing her husband and could prove it.<br /><br />Suddenly the complete household of Roger Ackroyd comprising of his sister-in-law, Mrs Ackroyd; his niece, Miss Flora Ackroyd; his stepson, Captain Ralph Paton; his best friend, Major Hector Blunt; his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond; butler, Parker and housekeeper, Miss Russell are all under suspicion. Hercule Poirot, who has retired and now lives in the same village, is urged by Flora to take up this case. Poirot suspects that everyone is hiding something or the other.<br /><br />Why was Roger Ackroyd killed?<br />Did he finally know who was blackmailing Mrs Ferrars and so was killed before he could reveal the blackmailer?<br />What is the mystery of the pulled out and illogically placed chair in the study where Mr. Ackroyd was killed?<br /><br />'An opened window,' he said.<br />'A locked door. A chair that apparently moved itself. To all three I say \\"Why?\\" and I find no answer.'<br /><br />Who was the mysterious man Dr. Sheppard saw coming towards the house?<br />Who was Roger Ackroyd talking to at nine thirty when no one seemed to have entered the study?<br />Who called Dr. Sheppard and informed him of Mr. Ackroyd's murder when no one in his house knew that he had been killed?<br /><br />Can Poirot solve this baffling case where suspects are too many and each has a reason to commit the murder?<br />With conflicting statements and unreliable alibis, will this case prove a first time failure for the great Hercule Poirot?<br /><br />A case unlike any other, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a mystery in the class of mysteries where the concept is so novel that it will shock you and surprise you, leaving you with your mouth hanging open even though decades have passed since its publication! Howsoever, I tried I could not come up with one clear suspect. Agatha Christie expertly shifts her focus of suspicions from one character to another leaving the reader with no clue as to the real murderer. I tried all my \\"little grey cells\\" but could not pin point the murderer and when the killer was finally introduced I felt as if I had been punched so hard that no air was left in my lungs!<br /><br />The characterization and story development is exquisite. The interactions between the narrator, Dr. Sheppard and his gossipy and always \\"scandal mongering\\" sister, Caroline were just too good and highly entertaining. The wit, humor and outright funny descriptions of Caroline by Dr. Sheppard left me chuckling and looking forward to their playful bantering and Caroline's efforts at accumulating information from everyone.<br /><br />1) 'Caroline can do any amount of finding out by sitting placidly at home. I don't know how she manages it, but there it is. I suspect that servants and the tradesman constitute her Intelligent Corps. When she goes out, it is not to gather information, but to spread it. At that too, she is amazingly expert.'<br /><br />2) 'My sister's nose, which is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does when she is interested or excited over anything.'<br /><br />The narration of the incidents by Dr Sheppard was interesting and engaging. I loved his humor and his confusion regarding Poirot's actions. His description of the hobbies of the villagers was outright hilarious.<br /><br />Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the one word, 'gossip.'<br /><br />Like many of Agatha Christie's other books, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd also has a village setting with gossipy villagers who are more interested in other people's affairs and take great pride in knowing things about others that are not public knowledge. Caroline is the same. She is always nosing for information and so when a new man moves into the neighboring cottage she wants to know everything about him but is unable to do so. The results of her speculation about the mysterious man who happens to be Hercule Poirot are hilarious and very entertaining. The only thing she knows is that he is a foreigner and interested in the growing of vegetable marrows!<br /><br />'To Caroline's extreme annoyance, she has not been able to find out anything about him, except that he is a foreigner. The Intelligence Corps has proved a broken reed.'<br /><br />'But that is certainly not the sort of information that Caroline is after. She wants to know where he comes from, what he does, whether he is married, what his wife was, or is, like, whether he has children, what his mother's maiden name was -and so on. Somebody very like Caroline must have invented the questions.'<br /><br />Poirot is the constant source of discussion between the brother and sister and they come up with extremely funny suggestions as to his profession.<br /><br />'My dear Caroline,' I said. 'There is no doubt at all about what the man's profession has been.<br />He's a retired hairdresser. Look at that moustache of his.' Caroline dissented. She said that if the man was a hairdresser, he would have wavy hair- not straight. All hairdressers did.<br /><br />The character sketch of Poirot is like a caricature with 'An egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two immense moustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes.'<br />'Clearly a retired hairdresser. Who knows the secrets of human nature better than a hairdresser?'<br /><br />This book is clearly one of the superior works of Christie and recently also voted \\"Best Crime Novel Ever\\" is a book with the right mix of light and funny moments coupled with serious, dark and mysterious moments. The dialogues between characters are legendary and remain in our memory long after we have finished reading the book.<br /><br />1) 'The good dog, he does not leave the scent, remember!'<br />2) 'Method, order, and the little grey cells.'<br />3) 'Everyone has something to hide.'<br />4) 'Only one kind- the fool in love.'<br />5) 'it is not easy to hide things from Hercule Poirot. He has a knack of finding out.'<br /><br />The description of the killer is chilling and leaves the reader shuddering at the thought of such a person in reality. A man so normal and friendly that no one suspects him and he often finds himself playing the role of a confidante to many secrets which people, thinking him harmless, kind and understanding, share with him unaware of his \\"strain of weakness\\" and \\"blunted moral fibre\\".<br /><br />'Let us take a man - a very ordinary man. A man with no idea of murder in his heart. There is in him somewhere a strain of weakness- deep down...He may stumble by accident on a secret - a secret involving life or death of somebody...Here is a chance to make money..He becomes greedy. And in his greed he overreaches himself...Exposure faced the man of whom we are speaking. And he is not the same man he was -say a year ago. His moral fibre is blunted. He is desperate, He is fighting a losing battle, and he is prepared to take any means that come to his hand, for exposure means ruin to him. And so -the dagger strikes!'<br /><br />'Afterwards.' he went on softly,<br />'the dagger removed he will be himself again, normal, kindly.<br />But if need again arises, then once more he will strike.'<br /><br />This is one book that can be reread any number of times and it will entertain and shock us each time. An ageless and a gem from a legendary author, I give The Murder of Roger Ackroyd a full shining 5 stars out of 5 and very highly recommend that you read this amazing mystery. A must read for everyone and a deserving \\"must have\\" for every avid reader.<br /><br />This review is also available on the blog Njkinny's World of Books..ho knows the secrets of human nature better than a hairdresser?'<br /><br />This book is clearly one of the superior works of Christie and recently also voted \\"Best Crime Novel Ever\\" is a book with the right mix of light and funny moments coupled with serious, dark and mysterious moments.

B001OGWY1W|2.0|Yuck!  This wasn't worth the watching.  My teen boys didn't enjoy it either.  Batman was raspy voiced, The action was ...hmmm...lame.  What a downer.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Hi like the app alot and its very cool i can get the weather in less than 30 seconds bye
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Surprisingly good.  All of it was great.  Teen and adult approved for thumbs up.  Visuals were great. Story line worked.
0142406112|5.0|I was very surprised by how well written it was, much better written and more realistic than the graphic novel and movie. My students enjoyed it so much!
B000JO9JHW|2.0|Too many naked women and sex to enjoy the story line.  My teens were tired of turning their heads and they're boys.  There was no real reason to keep watching someone graphically killing others.  It seemed to say that knifing people is okay if you think they're bad.  You get the same effect each episode with a weak story line to lead up to a kill.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The author provided many twists and turns to her story that made you want to keep on reading until the end!
B00AA2W4L6|4.0|It was great.  Action throughout with a story line that continued to the end.  Visuals were great.  Teens enjoyed it as well as their parent.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|There are very few albums/CDs that I've purchased (ever) that I like from beginning to end - Blackberry Smoke's \\"The Whippoorwill\\" is one of the best compilations, of any genre, I've ever heard.  There isn't a single song on this CD that isn't good.  The band has captured what is great about Southern Rock in this album, and every lyric is crafted to perfection.<br /><br />Thank goodness I came across Blackberry Smoke - I would have been deprived of some amazing music had I not found this CD.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Definitely my favorite version of this book adaptation yet. I really appreciate the length, which gives us time for actual character development. Places and costumes and cinematography are all exquisite as well.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I read the books, so I went into this movie with a lot of expectations and to my delight the movie completely blew me away. My favorite part of this book to movie adaption, besides the incredible cast, and the amazing effects, was the way they remastered the story. I love E. R. Burroughs' epic story telling, but there were points in the story that felt a little forced. I'm happy to say that those parts were not mindlessly duplicated into this movie. No, they took one of my favorite stories, and made it better. Thank you Disney for letting this happen.
0553801473|5.0|I have been reading George RR Martin since the mid-nineties, and consider A Song of Ice and Fire to be a work of genius.  That said, Dance is my least favorite of the books so far, even though I have insider info on what will happen to Jon. (Cackle.) We all know how cavalierly he kills off beloved characters, but this book was a bit over the top for me.  But of course I am waiting anxiously for the next book. . . .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very fun and addicting!!  Love to crush those candies. Hate that jelly. ;)<br />Never thought I would like it as much as I do
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|A really great addition to the Star Trek family.  Exciting and fun to watch.  Enjoyed watching it with my family, I am really liking this reboot of Star Trek.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Easy to get into the tension of the plot and familiarity with the characters.  Unless the book is compelling and well written, I don't bother to finish it. Surprisingly, the book is both. I did finish it right to the mind boggling end.
B0036FYO12|4.0|Suspenseful, but dated.  Still a good movie for a date night or late-night-cant'-sleep-night.  Robert Redford is almost always good, except when he talks politics.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|I am a total nerd , I have no music talent other then turning a radio knob . But I know good music when I hear it , and this is about as good as it gets .<br /><br /> One often ask's the question , \\"are there not any classical music composers , or writers of today\\" ? With this CD work you can say , \\" here is a great one \\" . The music is crisp , ever changing , thoughtful and a delight to listen to . One walks away from listening to this CD a changed person for the better , it is not background music , it take every bit of energy and attention to listen it . It justifies the money you spent for a high end stereo system .<br /><br /> If I had the talent to write music , and I wish I did , this is what I would love to have said I wrote and conducted .
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Loved the idea of showing what everyone connected with a stage show goes through.  The producer, director, stage manager, ensemble and star all have their own problems.  All the actors are wonderful and believable.  Enjoyed Season 1 immensely.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|Love this game. So addicting and so much fun. I give it 2 thumbs up and would highly recommend it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't wait to go to next page. Could actually feel the anguish the characters were feeling as well as their will to survive
B00CEZJT2E|1.0|I purchased this backup charger to use on a trip I was taking to Nepal.  The Anker charger looks very nice, is lightweight, and is a convenient size.  I used it for two days before my trip at the office and at home, with no issues.  Then the day before I was to leave (the third day I owned it), it would no longer take a charge (multiple usb chargers tried, multiple outlets), and there is no way to reset it or see what is wrong.  By the time I came back from my trip, the return window had closed and I now have a samsung s3-sized paperweight.  Great idea, incredibly horrible execution.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Overall: This is by far Gaga's most diverse album pulling sounds from Rock, R&B, Rap, Hip Hop, Electronic, Techno, and of course Pop. Regardless of all the genre mixing, the album stays true to the definitive Pop sound and dramatic Lady Gaga style productions that we've come to know. Although the album isn't perfect, it does a darn good job of exploring various themes of sex, drugs, gender roles, exploration, maturity, exploitation, dependence, addiction, loneliness, fashion, love, heartache, and fame, often keeping all these themes candidly tucked away in between playful electronic dance beats and double entendre lyrics.<br /><br /><Song by song><br />Aura- Great intro song, produced by Zedd and Gaga, has a very odd eery sound that is hard to get past by at first but is quickly forgiven by the crispy chorus hook.<br /><br />Venus- Gaga's self produced track samples from a Sun Ra's Rocket #9 has a very retro feel, and is full of playful sexual innuendos, the abrupt skips in pace may not feel smooth to everyone but as more of a dance track, the changes of pace seem fitting.<br /><br />G.U.Y.- One of my personal favorites, great intro and catchy chorus. It feels like a signature pop song flipping the switch between girl and guy, top and bottom sexual roles.<br /><br />Jewels N' Drugs- This song is definitely not for everyone. Personally I doesn't drive me crazy but it's groovable. For those that actually listen to Hip Hop and Rap, this song might appeal them as Twista spits pretty decent raps in the ending bridge.<br /><br />MANiCURE- A very possible single track, deals with the dependence of love and the comfort and wholeness a man can give. This rock pop song has strong licks, playful lyrics, and plenty of room for bad*ss dancing.<br /><br />Do What U Want- Feels more like an R&B song it really shows Gaga's vocals with plenty of carefully carried out grovels and grunges. To my surprise the blend between Gaga and R.Kelly feels natural and has quite the sexy sound cranking a personal theme of the media and their love hate relationship with celebrities.<br /><br />ARTPOP- Psychedelic. Honestly this song feels entirely out of context in our current millenia but regardless is extremely addictive and as a title track, does a fine job of expressing Gaga's intention for the album as a diverse blend of music expressing the endless possibilities of how art can be expressed in pop music.<br /><br />Swine- Grunge and Electronic hit hard on this one as Gaga cuts the chord on an ugly character in her life. This song may not be for everyone but its probably the most era appropriate song in a world where electronic DJ's are producing radio POP music.<br /><br />Donatella, Fashion, and Mary Jane Holland are a little more forgettable. They're an easy listen and sometimes produce a few chuckles because of the raunchy and self aware lyrics, they serve as supportive tracks to the theme of the album.<br /><br />Dope- Gaga is a surprisingly good ballad writer. Speechless from The Fame Monster was a memorable ballad and Dope holds more than its own weight as a power ballad. The vocals are often unrestricted and do a fine job of exploiting harsh theme of failure, addiction, and love.<br /><br />Gypsy- Gypsy wraps the CD nicely with a power pop beats and a pounding bass expressing feelings of independence and adventure.<br /><br />Applause- It feels like the encore of the CD, through the entire coaster ride that is ARTPOP Gaga reminds the listener of why she makes all the music. She wants people to enjoy it and express it through Applause.<br /><br />Again the diversity of the CD may not be for everyone but that is what ARTPOP is all about, how POP music may be portrayed in all styles, genres, medias, etc.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I'm a Horror movie finatic and this movie really had me scared and that doesn't happen too often. Loved It! Deffinately Watch this is you Love Horror movies like me.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I had been waiting for a set like this for a long time. As I love the movies I did not want to buy them each singly as I knew there would just be another one to get eventually. I bought this set for about $62 and I thought that was a fair price for all 8 films on blu-ray.<br />These films and book are a work of art and a truly fun adventure. I have to have a marathon every year to experience it all over again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting! Once you start there is no turning back! I love this game....it is so fun but hard to put down!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game.  Kills lots of time! I highly recommend this game to all ages.  Good solid graphics. Smooth gameplay. Good sound effects.  Easy enough for anyone to play.
B0093LINVK|5.0|Great little machine.  Ubuntu works perfectly on it.  You do need to buy an mSATA hard drive, wifi adapter, DDR3 memory, and a power cord separately.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's fun and it's free. What else do you need to say. Rovio programmers are spot on with their games.
B008JFUO36|5.0|This is an action filled si-fi movie staring Tom Cruise.There are a few good surprises and a lot of adventure. Tom Cruise is good, but it is Morgan Freeman who plays an excellent role and makes this the outstanding movie that it is.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It's fun and it's free. What else do you need to say. Rovio programmers are spot on with their games.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots of hrs of fun. Not like others, you do 3 scenes n the game is over. This one is full version. Great that it was free.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's fun and it's free. What else do you need to say. Rovio programmers are spot on with their games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers could be better no efense but my cousin is absolutely addicted to it for an example when we were at the bowling alley after i was done bowling I got my mom's phone without asking and went somewhere private and she said  what cha doing and I said playing subway surfers and her face light up like you would not believe<br /><br />  THE.  END.  ...........
006202406X|4.0|Veronica Roth was under a lot of pressure to meet the expectations of the next big YA series and I commend her for writing the story through to the end as she saw and felt it and not to please those who need the happily ever after. I agree with some criticism that sometimes her writing felt stilted, but she is a young and developing author and she created and took command of her own world and filled it with characters that clearly, the fans loved.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the pace issue,the reader is either rushed through action or wading through arbitrary dialogue and waiting for something to happen. The author successfully brought many, many loose ends together and the story closed neatly, in my opinion, though extremely bittersweet. It was a quick and entertaining read with an emotional climax, and the series as a whole, is well worth the time spent with it if you can handle that love and loss always go hand in hand.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was an interesting story and kept me reading it throughout. I liked the characters and the interactions among them. Great read!
B00GMONG90|5.0|I've liked Pentatonix since their \\"Evolution of Music\\" video. And from all the comments on there, I figured it'd be a good idea to watch their season of The Sing-Off. That's when I fell in love with the way they build music and fill out their sound with so few voices. And you could just connect with each one of them and their specific charisma and quirks on stage.<br /><br />Their \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" and \\"Love Lockdown\\" replaced the originals for me.<br /><br />Now, I liked PTX Volume 1. I respected their more polished sound and it was a nice easy listen. But it felt more like a compilation, and I just wasn't especially interested in the originals of most of those songs to begin with. Their Gotye and fun. covers were especially good, and I liked their original \\"Show You How to Love.\\"<br /><br />Fastforward to this week, with PTX, Vol. 2 coming out and it's a whole different story.<br /><br />1. \\"Can't Hold Us\\" -- I liked the Macklemore track just fine, but didn't really get the whole 'song of the summer' hype it was getting. PTX's version, I love. It feels this epic battle chant, as if 20 voices were on the track. Scott, Mitch and Kirstie put so damn much personality into their vocals and every one of them gets a moment to shine, with Avi booming the hook. 9/10<br /><br />2. \\"Natural Disaster\\" -- a PTX original, but you couldn't tell without being told. It sounds familiar, but it's own thing. You can tell how much they've grown as songwriters, because this blends into the album so well. Scott's lead is heartfelt and the whole song is sweet and full of restraint. I'm not a big fan of the hook, but this is pop done well. 8/10<br /><br />3. \\"Love Again\\" -- another PTX original, and again, someone would have to tell you this was an original. It's a really good dance track, very much in the vein of \\"Show You How To Love,\\" but better even than that. It's getting to the point where I'm not sure how to address PTX originals, when they can stand shoulder to shoulder with their covers, like this does, because I honestly think this is better than anything on PTX, Vol. 1. 9/10<br /><br />4. \\"Valentine\\" -- now, I wasn't especially a fan of the Jessie Ware original. It was an alright track. But the sweet calmness that they approach it with, and their soft harmonies. Mitch comes in so softly underneath the melody, whereas Jessie has a bit of a pushier voice and sort of tells you, instead of pleading with you. They grab you from the first note and they proved they can make headphone music as well as speaker/dance music. 9.5/10<br /><br />5. \\"Hey Momma / Hit the Road Jack\\" -- half original/half cover. Coming in, this was the track I was most looking forward to. A modern remix of Ray Charles' Hit the Road Jack. Now, this is really well done. I love the transitions and how they worked in the original. It had great bounce to it and the 2nd half was the song I wanted the whole thing to be. It was just a bit too sweet and lovey dance club, when I wanted more of a bite to it? 8/10<br /><br />6. \\"I Need Your Love\\" -- a cover of a Calvin Harris original. And I gotta just flat out say it. It feels like a cover and it doesn't quite stand next to the original, or feel like a special different take on it. It feels like something that maybe wouldn't have even made it onto PTX Volume 1. It's not bad, but it is the weakest track on the record to me. 7/10<br /><br />7. \\"Run to You\\" -- an original. Wow. That's just about all I have to say. 10/10<br /><br />If ever those PTX kids made an original song that could legitimately chart well and break through, it's this. This is one of the best songs I've heard all year, and the best original they've ever made. It's gorgeous and somber and deep and it never lets you go from the first note. One of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a good while. Again...10/10<br /><br />8. \\"Daft Punk\\" -- a medley of Daft Punk songs including: Technologic, One More Time (several times), Get Lucky, Digital Love, Harder Better FasterStronger, Television Rules the Nation & Get Lucky. They. Killed. It. 10/10<br /><br />It is absolutely perfect, and that's coming from someone who always knew and decently liked Daft Punk songs, but never loved them like a lot of people. They'll make you love it. The transitions are so brilliant, and ever single of them has at least a couple standout moments. My favorite being Avi singing Television Rules the World. I'm not sure they'll ever make a more inventive and talent-stretching song than this again, because this is them at the absolute height of their powers. Again...10/10.<br /><br />9. \\"Save the World / Don't You Worry Child\\" -- a mashup of Swedish House Mafia's originals. It's an album exclusive track, and it is such a beautiful way to end the album. Save the World on its own would be a good, albeit sort of 'same ol PTX' dance track for them to cover, but this mashup is seamless, and Scott's vocals on Don't You Worry Child are so heartfelt, that it just raises the whole record up. It's beautiful, catchy and it makes you wanna dance. It's a testament to all of their strengths and interests and talents all at once. 9.5/10<br /><br />It goes without saying how great Avi and Kevin are, but the PTX kids really outdid themselves with this one. Their first album felt more like something they had to put out to capitalize on how YouTube famous their songs had made them, but this is just very, very good music. And if you're open to it, one of best dance albums of the year.<br /><br />Standout tracks: \\"Run to Me\\" \\"Daft Punk\\" & \\"Save the World / Don't You Worry Child\\"Stronger, Television Rules the Nation & Get Lucky. They. Killed. It. 10/10<br /><br />It is absolutely perfect, and that's coming from someone who always knew and decently liked Daft Punk songs, but never loved them like a lot of people. They'll make you love it. The transitions are so brilliant, and ever single of them has at least a couple standout moments. My favorite being Avi singing Television Rules the World.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun to play these games,  candy crush is a challenging and frustrating game but i love it  addicting
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Th  book was rely good I loved all the romance and katniss hunting to survive and how the ending was kinda sad
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'll give it a five star! The romance and thriller on these books keep me going and going. Unstoppable to read!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Really good album - Rap God has to be one of my favorites of the album. Kind of a different album that ones in the past though. But if you know his style and his humor (and like it), you'll enjoy the album.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I downloaded this for my seven year old son. He loves it. I have to make him stop playing it sometimes! Lol.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|love the way this movie unfolds. don't think its his best work but still a good film. I would definitely recommend and it was very good on the big screen.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Book was very informative and shows the true talent of Tesla. Another reason why I don\\"t like Edison was how he always tried to screw Tesla over. This book shows the truth.
B0094D462M|5.0|You can never go wrong with Top Gun.  It has a bit of action, love, comedy, and tragedy.  Everything people want in their movies all wrapped up, nicely by the way, in one movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have not played this game a lot on Kindle, but liked playing the game.  This candy crush is different, I play this game on other games sites.  Lots of fun, and a good way to pass the time.
0312430000|5.0|Oh, I love love love love love this book. So many applications, so relevant to many workplace and real life situations. My most memorable segment refers to the usefulness and reasons behind having everyone state their names when working in a team/group. Thanks Dr. Gawande!!1
B008XG1X18|5.0|Being able to get to Pintrest on my Kindle frees up my PC, Mac and phone. Now I can share on the go.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|The book starts well but quickly descends into a repetitive, predictable onslaught on the ideals being expressed. Ultimately, none of the characters are entertaining.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|I didn't knew what I have to think about this one. It is amazing and fun to read.<br />You need to keep your head around all the perspectives in the story but that is what makes it fun.<br /><br />A thriller on a simple case made complex and told simple.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I read books on the bus and I loved it=) it took me three days but he has a lot of books. Ricks books they have a lot of actions and surprises.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|If you enjoyed Men in Black, you'll enjoy this. Take it at face value and just have fun. If you're looking for &#34;High Art&#34;, this ain't it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simply perfect. Just the game in a simple playable format you come back to<br /><br />over and over again. This is what I like.
0399255370|5.0|this is the best book I have purchased in a long time.  it's so clever and I really love how he tells the story with letters which also exposed kids to letter writing which is rare these days.  The story is hilarious and our school rates it A+++
0143116738|2.0|It started off great for the first few pages. Completely agree about the education and all, but then it feels like there's some ranting. As the book kept going, the harder and harder it was to keep up and finish it. Literally, I felt like I had to truck through this thing. He basically just drills it into your skull that you need to find what you're good at doing and do that, no matter what anyone else says.<br /><br />Great! I learned that when I was 12. No need to write a book about it and bore me with example after never ending example, to then go on a rant.<br /><br />I wish it was presented in a better manner. It just kept dragging with no excitement or anything and I often times started to dinf myself day dreaming as I was reading. So in other words, the words just bounced right off my eyes.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it one star, was that I agree with what's in the book. The way it's presented is just terrible.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive!!!! I love it but it's very tempting!  You will feel the urge to pay for more lives and advancements. REALLY GREAT GAME!!!
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Great album! You must purchase it, is so relaxing. Can' believe that such a valuable album could be sold this cheap. It is worth the money 100%.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play candy crush on my phone and computer as well as my kindle, and this is by far my favorite. Keep it up!
B001NIA27E|5.0|Came in excellent condition and on time as promised. if you like Pierce Brosnan you'll love him in this adventure.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|I was ok.... I like the first two better, the beard guy is my hero.. Chang is a lill out there...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app because you can tell when you need to wake up with your own music. Also, I know you will love it to.
1936608898|5.0|I am more than 2 weeks into the 30-day plan, and I already am completely sold on the lifestyle outlined in this book. I feel better, look better (clearer skin, dropping pounds), and my energy levels and moods are more consistent throughout the day. My cravings for all the junk foods I was eating before this--cheese, sweets, breads--have been incredibly easy to manage. (I made it through Halloween without a single bite of candy, no sweat... and I normally am a sugar fiend!) I've also been forced to learn new ways to prepare vegetables that don't necessitate ranch dressing, ketchup or cheese.<br /><br />The book itself is really well thought out. I think they do a great job of outlining the problems with what most of us eat (they describe a typical eating day for most of us that could have been written about me), then making the case for the foods they are advocating. I think they strike a good balance between moderation and giving you strict guidelines so that you can't cheat so much that you don't benefit from the 30-day plan.<br /><br />I love that the focus is on getting you to eat whole, unprocessed foods, and educating you to carefully read food labels. (I had no idea that my almond milk had such nasty additives in it, or that you can't buy dill pickles in the normal grocery store that don't have Yellow 5!) They lay out a clear plan and give you tools to be successful, down to how to respond when loved ones pressure you to eat something off plan.<br /><br />Yes, it has been challenging to navigate this plan when I'm out to eat or dining at a friend's house (though not cancer-treatment hard, as they point out), but it can be done, and I've been surprised at how accommodating and supportive everyone in my life has been.<br /><br />I would say that keys to success include:<br />1) You have to be open to lots of vegetables, and meat.<br />2) You will need to do some basic work to make your life easier, like making homemade mayo (which has been so helpful so I can eat tuna fish for lunch!) and clarifying butter. Both are easy, but take patience and time.<br />3) Don't set yourself up for failure by building your 30 days around a holiday. (I strategically timed mine to finish 2 days before Thanksgiving. I won't go out and gorge myself that day, but it will be nice to have a glass of wine and not stress over the butter and milk in the sweet potatoes my sister makes.)<br />4) Know that it will take time and planning. Each weekend I sit down and plan out meals for the week, grocery shop for the ingredients I'll need, and prepare foods I can eat off for a few days.<br />5) Access to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's has been key for me, but I'm sure you could also buy some things online if you needed.<br /><br />All of this, though, is worth it. You will feel better than ever, and it can change your life if you're open to it. Good luck!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game takes a lot of skill and thinking outside the box, to solve it's puzzles. I have found some short cuts for some levels, but there are a few that &#34;kicked my butt&#34;. Lol... great game... great graphics...
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is great, it will keep you entertained forty hours on end. Even at its high price it is the best game on the market.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|If you love classical music this is the perfect item for you! I bought this album while reading the 50 Shades trilogy and really wanted something that came right from the book. Out of curiosity I would play the songs as I came across them in the book to see what song they were referring to and that made the book more &#34;real&#34; to me to engage in. I am not the biggest classical music fan but do see the benefit of listening to this type of music. It can be relaxing and opens another style of music to engage in and believe in keeping open and ever changing options available. At first the free mp3 additions were a bit of a worry. I am not the most knowledgeable when it comes to technical abilities and worried that I could not  figure out the Cloud Player. With the help of a very knowledgeable Amazon Employee they helped me get things set up and now have the benefit of both the cd AND the mp3 songs that are on my PC. I just bought an Mp3 player for my wife and now have some hope that I can get all the music from here to her addition as well. Thank you Amazon for all of your help and for helping me make all of this work.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It has up to three alarms and just as many as I need.And mutipule tunes +more. Thats my alarm clock.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you have go places and want to watch Netflix or other services via non-smart TVs, this is a great solution.  Pays for itself with the free Netflix!  I recommend it!  Love controlling from my phone, too.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I don't watch cable tv; don't like it... Having the chromecast and watching netflix and youtube allowed me to purchase a bigger TV without the smartTV stuff and save money. Works perfectly fine. Chrome tabs from my mac can be displayed as well and I can see my browser.<br />What I would really like is to be able to watch my full android phone. For instance I would like to have movies on my phone and stream them to the chromecast without depending on Netflix. Specially because not all movies are on netflix... I manage watching them on a chrome tab on my mac through streaming, but it's not the same.....
B0042QNP2S|5.0|Precision engineering and sturdy construction make this a really nice toy for the grand kids. It also teams up nicely with other toys from this manufacturer.
006202406X|2.0|With the exception of the GP v GD thing being very anticlimatic<br /><br />SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br /><br />Tris's death was unnecessary. The ending could have been achieved with her life. What's the point of her surviving the death serum and being shot? The ending would have been sad and complicated enough with Roth's love of killing people. Everyone's death seemed to have a purpose to drive the plot forward. But with Tris's, it seems like she just wanted to be one of those author's who kills the main character in a desperate flee from a cliche \\"happy ending.\\"<br />It felt forced. Weird. And not in line with her style. Honestly I just feel emotionally betrayed. Dead. -_-
B003Y5HWJU|3.0|I was looking for another HBO series that would force me to buy all seasons and be a keeper... but this isn't one. I thought Buscemi did a great job in the lead role and I didn't think he was at all over the top. I like period pieces, gangsters and crime but Season 1 failed to develop the characters and further the plot with some pretty interesting characters. We watched for hours waiting for something to happen and it rarely did. The show relies too much on the set, costumes and music of the 1920's and though it does a great job at that it does so by ignoring the action, plot development and use of character actors. Watching some of these actors sitting around in their apartments really did nothing but chew up some time. There were some interesting segments and cleverness but by the time you sit though all the dullness I really didn't care. I went with 3-stars because there's about one disc worth of good entertainment out of the five.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how easy it is to figure out percentages. Not that it was hard before but they somehow made an easy thing even easier. Nice big buttons on the Kindle Fire too. Great app, well done.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a fun game in the same genre a myst.  The play time was under an hour for me, but I plan on getting the sequel.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Page turner from the very beginning. You are pulled into the lives of the characters and will not soon forget them.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|So funny to learn the secret behind Randall's evil squint.  The Blue Umbrella short was really cute.  The only disappointment is that the bonus features are only on the Blu-Ray and not on the DVD, and I don't have Blu-Ray (yet).
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I  bought this for my daughter and loves this case.  She takes it to the pool and takes videos and pic under water.  Works great and no issues with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so greatful that candy crush is finally on kindle fire!!! I was feeling so out of the loop with all my friends bragging about what levels they were on.....better late then never!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|By far the best app for relaxation noises. It's fully customizable and can continue to play in the background. I use it at work all day, it really helps me block out the office noise and focus on my projects.
0765348276|2.0|Old Man's War was disappointingly lackluster. I had been wanting to read Scalzi for a while, but Old Man's War proved . . . boring, really. The characters are wooden and two-dimensional, and while the small glimpses of the protagonist's relationship with his wife were humanizing, they were minor blips on the screen between rapid-fire techno-jargon; hordes of aliens killing and being killed; and human soldiers we barely meet before they die, often for no significant reason. The protagonist, John Perry, is able to stay alive and find solutions to every problem thrown at him while others die, yet there's never even an attempt at explaining why he's smarter or his artificial body more capable than all the other soldiers dying around him. The author never really successfully made me feel connected to any of the characters. In the end, it was a rather banal science fiction story, inoffensive but utterly forgettable.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Action movie that will keep you chuckling throughout.  I'd categorize it more as a comedy with plenty of action thoughout.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|excellent movie sooooo well done and acting superb. the opulence just sucks you into that time period. cant say enough. if you haven't seen it your in for a treat!!!!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|not quite what I was expecting but pleasantly surprised and entertained.  good story line and effects are fantastic.  hope there's a part 2.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. I had to retread it so I could go see the new movie coming out soon.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Took a long time to get to the plot. Not the typical John Grisham novel. The characters were mot very interesting
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game its really cool fun and entertaining love this game . its amazing. kid friendly as well as adult friendly
B004J4WKTW|4.0|As some books take us into realms that fill our souls with dread or happiness, books that allow us to see into twisted or naive souls, this tale is filled with magic and enchantment.  A true pleasurable experience. Brain candy, filled with magic and love. Sorry it ended.
0316055433|2.0|I am trying to make myself finish this tome.  It is the biggest disappointment after her other glowing novels.  I felt like the story would never get out of the desert--literally.  I tripped through her others, sad when I finished them. I have read and reread the end flap trying to figure out why I feel so betrayed.  I would have to say this is beautifully written boring book.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Love this soundtrack! It is better than the movie itself! M83 did a great job setting the mood for the file.
1416550518|5.0|Kate Morton writes books you want to stay up all night for.  All her stories are set in interesting places and packed with characters who are believable and interesting.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|This was such a cute book! I was expecting more of a story, not just a collection of comics, but it was so adorable that I didn't mind. I think this is more for cat parents who can see their cat doing/acting like Pusheen does. I was raised with cats, but realized as an adult that dogs are the pet for me. Still, these cartoons are adorable, even if the length of the book itself was a bit disappointingly short.<br /><br />Copy courtesy of Touchstone, via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Very well written. Moves quickly. Very enjoyable. Well developed characters. Story moves among quickly, keeping you in suspense. Looking forward to next one!!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|It was so-so. From the details on the summary I guess I had a different expectation. The book was readable. Characters were okay. The &#34;back in time&#34; parts seemed confusing to me. Maybe if I could have read it all in one day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game so addictive could play it all day if it had unlimited lives five is just not enough
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|V disappointing how Kay seems to be always feeling sorry for herself and thinking that Marino is trying to get into her pants. It just distracts the reader from enjoying the story proper. It was makes Scarpetta out to be a whiner! Enjoyed her earlier books much better.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Creative. Doesn't take that much of a leap to see the natural progression where real time existing technology coupled with youthful inexperience and idealism enables a scenario that could be debated either way.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This was really enjoyable, a bit long but you hardly notice. The one question I have is why didn't they attempt to send another person through the wormhole? That way they could corroborate her story, or did I miss something that explained why they couldn't? That seems like the obvious thing to do. That being said this movie is definitely a modern classic worth watching, 5*
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I enjoyed this fun, well made, well acted movie. Thought all the actors were near spot-on and the special effects were a joy to experience. Yep, I'd watch it again with a smile. A++
B00BGI08GG|5.0|excellent show very well done.  Makes you want to binge watch though.  I would love to see more shows like this.  Well scripted with good acting.
B004WMKSH2|2.0|The movie was fine, what I could see of it.  The picture quality was awful, much too dark. Night scenes might just as well have been blank screens.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I really liked this movie and my mom loves Rupert Penry-Jones. After watching this movie, I bought the book to read it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clearly the one must have UTILITY. Without doubt it should be loaded before any other app. Really a space aver that does a REAL service. Why it's free and ad free with no &quot;buy this or that&quot; is something  that I do not question.
B0011UF79C|5.0|I LOVE this movie! Ethan Hawke is hot, too, but I also think that this movie is great for showing science fiction that can actually happen in the next decade or so with the advances we've had with DNA research and the ethical questions it brings up.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Very well written narrative of one of the most insane missions I've ever had the pleasure of reading the recount of.  Marcus does a fantastic job relaying just how brave his teammates were in battle.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app, first and foremost, has incredible variety. Dozens upon dozens of instruments- everything from obscure Japanese strings to calliopes to several different kinds of organ. There were several I didn't even recognize.<br /><br />The keyboard is adjustable, so finding a comfortable key size is easy. But perhaps best of all is the huge library of online songs, featuring easy and intuitive tutorials for everything ranging from classics to pop hits to movie soundtracks to anime OST s. It's terrific.
B007SVPZMW|3.0|Never got a chance to use it as I don't have a smart phone. But thanks for the chance to try it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this addicting game but frustrated when out of lives and need to wait. Don't like asking friends for help get to next level. Personally would like to have an option to purchase a version with full lives and levels with the option to compete with friends.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Just started playing this game.  It is very very sensitive and sometimes the shot is taken in error by just moving your finger over the area.  It is fun.
B001TW68P4|4.0|I loved the turtles when I was in high school.  There were 3or4 songs I was unfamiliar with but the well known songs \\"Happy Together\\" \\"Eleanor\\" etc are pleasant reminders of a happy youth.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was absolutely capturing! I could not put it down. Not a child's book but one to make you think.
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|Another great hit for my son.  His collection is complete.  Thank you.  He loves this collection.  This figurine is well made.
1451666179|5.0|If you read Depression Part I or II online like the rest of the world, you should have a pretty good idea of what this book is and what it does. It is hilarious and insightful, and it makes you laugh so hard your face is so wet with tears you won't know if you're sad or happy or just confused.<br /><br />You'll either get this or you won't. Don't take my word for it, read one of her blog posts, and if you love it, you'll love this. If you don't, you're probably the Grinch Who Stole Christmas and you shouldn't be allowed to buy books on Amazon anyway.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love playing this with my 7,9 &amp; 10year old. They like to compete, and they don't even realize their learning. My husband and I also have with this game
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|1st 3 albums great we all know that. I was looking forward to this album with no expectations. The last three albums have their own sound, but have remained congruent with the sound of Arcade Fire. This one certainly has its own sound and sounds nothing like I could have dreamed this group would write. Its not horrible, but I'm not going to pretend that this is something I could get use to. I'm not going to train my brain to like it. I commend AF for writing music they believe in, but this is not for me. Maybe I'm not \\"cool\\" enough.<br /><br />Update 3/26/2014: I actually like it. I get it....0_0
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I thought it was a great series!  If it you like Divergent, you will like this series as well.  I really like the strong female characters that this series and Divergent has to offer.
B00FN811SY|5.0|So much information at your finger tips, so easy to use. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to quickly compare different Bible translations.
037575251X|5.0|I HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT BOOKS FROM JACK LONDON.  THE STORIES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS AND I JUST HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TIME TO READ THEM.  I NOW OWN SEVERAL OF HIS BOOKS AND HAVE ENJOYED EACH ONE.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I must say the lady gets a lot of crap, I can't seem to figure out really why. I really am digging this record. I think its better than the naysayers have been saying. whats wrong with a little sex. This is a sexual record and I think it may be a good thing. songs that I really did are all of them. sexxx is very hot. thanks gaga for a great pop record.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|Gave it a four but more a three star rating, a bit heavy going jumping about between characters. Ending a bit strange/incomplete. Suspect I may have missed the point of the story some how.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I really enjoyed the storyline.  A good, easy read.  Although clearly targets a younger audience, I really liked it.  Great trilogy.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I would not recommend it to anyone.  Sorry, but the S&M stuff just really turns me off.  Guess I have suffered too much of it for too long.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I am no stranger to P. D. James' work. I have read several of her books and have found them interesting enough to hold my attention readily.  This book was so boring that I found it extremely difficult to read. The narrative was repetitious  and overly wordy.  It was definitely written in a style far different from that of Jane Austen.  Darcy, and even Elizabeth, came across as entirely different people than their characters in the original Austen novel. I have always found them to be very charming characters; in this book they are just boring.
B000I62JBE|5.0|Loved this movie! But, how can you go wrong with a cast like this!?!? They were really great together. Need I say more?
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed this book, even all of John Corey's smart alecky remarks.  I also learned a lot more about Yemen than I ever thought I wanted to know.  One suggestion I would like to make that I think would increase readers' enjoyment of this book is a map.  Mr. DeMille needs to include a map of Yemen so we can picture the route his subjects are taking when they are traveling through this very frightening country.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I use to play candy crush on facebook but now play it on my tablet thru amazon.  I play it for hours.  I am stuck on this game and love it.  I think anyone who plays this becomes glued to it and can't quit either.  LOVE IT
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Very well organized, with excellent T o C and index, well written (the occasional bursts of humor tolerable), and very thorough.  This is a very professional work and well worth the price.  LR is a complex program, and while the book doesn't simplify the program itself, it does provide a clear guide to using the program.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|I did not like this movie. It would have somewhat much better if Denzel was not the star. This is not a type of character for Denzel. I love Denzel Washington, but not in the character
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wanted to stream Netflix. I am not tech savvy but this was easy to install,even for me. Nice to watch tv instead of tablet.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Ones of Steven Kings best. This film I really like. Add this one to your Steven King collection today. Great film
B00A4GXJD0|2.0|Rehashed and uninspired. This is NOT worth buying. Nothing on this is new or artistically interesting. It's too bad - I bought it without pop reviewing samples first.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Love point and click mysteries/HO games. This one  is another hit with me. Story is top notch. I'm playing on my kindle 8.5 with no problems. Can't wait for the sequel! The keepers 2.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I've been looking forward to \\"ARTPOP\\" for a long time, and while I enjoy the album very much, it reminds me so much of Lady Gaga's previous work. Nothing wrong with that, but it's nice to see music evolve after a while, you know? Any of these tracks could easily be from one of her prior albums...that's how similar the styles are. Favorite tracks for me are \\"Applause,\\" the first single off the album; \\"Gypsy,\\" and the emotional ballad titled, believe it or not, \\"Dope.\\" The other songs are all very good, but nothing really rocked me to the core. It's all more of the same Gaga. Very good, but I was expecting something more.
B00G32OER4|3.0|I had a solid start. 3/4s of the film was really great. It was atmospheric, suspenseful and downright creepy.  There came a point where the movie seemed to turn into just about every other horror flick and I felt it lost its mojo. It's worth watching, though.
0788859544|2.0|The disc was poor quality, terribly overused and scratched, and somehow extremely thin. But, better than nothing I guess. Pretty disappointed though to be honest.
B001MM28JG|5.0|If you like movies that are really funny and have nice special effects then you have to see Galaxy Quest. You'll laugh till you cry.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is another one of those books by Kate Morton that swings back and forth from the past to the present, and from one generation of characters to another.  It had many fascinating twists and turns, and I couldn't put it down.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Simple and great action/adventure movie.  Great actors.  Good Dialog.  The pace moved very nicely and some of my all time favorite actors were in this.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Brilliant fun, very well done.  Laugh out loud funny throughout which is why we fell in love with Bridget in the first place.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This was a good movie, my whole family enjoyed it a lot. It is not a movie we will watch over and over so we will not be buying it for our collection.
B001FQMOCA|5.0|I never appreciated Johnny Cash while I was young until I saw this movie.  Reese & Joaquin really set the mark for them.  What an amazing performance by these two actors and was dumbfounded when knowing that is was their actual voices singing.  Amazing and mesmerized by their performance.  I wish they would really get together and be a couple.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|My family enjoyed watching it once but we will not be buying this one for our collection. They just said it wasn't exactly what they expected.
159463176X|5.0|This book is the third written by Khaled Hosseini and is, I feel, his best yet.  It is the story of several generations of one family that leaves Afghanistan ond grows several fold.  I do not want to give the plot away, but this book will make you glad you are human.  You will not be able to put it out of your mind until long after you finish it.  DNA now proves that everyone in the world all had the same great-great grandmother and great-great grandfather many thousands of years ago.  This book shows us that our brothers and sisters, no matter where they come from, are just like us.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an excellent book to teach you a lesson on how good your life is and to show you that even when you have hard times there is always someone going through something harder than you!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love!!! Wonderful book, can't wait to finish the series. Best book I have read in a very long time!! <3
B009YN2M7S|4.0|This was a great book. But I must say it could have been in more detail. It was  a great book (even if you have seen the movie, by the way the book is way hchxhdhhdhhdhdhdddhbvexgjhexjhsuck a sick bitch this book sucked :)
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Although this show has a &#34;dark passenger&#34; it is still very good.  I will be sad to finish the season/series.

B001GXYBY6|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.
B00A92MDH2|5.0|Yes, I love Frank Zappa and Specifically this album.  I heard this album for the first time when Franklin himself played it for free. This album is a must have for any Zappa fan.  This is his master work, I think.  Thank God its available again!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.
B00005A0V0|5.0|This album is consistently referred to as the best example of the Canterberry Sound.  I just think that it is a great album.  Caravan hit one out of the park on this one.

0142405809|5.0|My grandson is two years old and is starting to love to look at books.  Last time we sat for about 20 minutes just turning the pages.  He likes this book.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Memory and childhood. Those two words sum up The Ocean at the End of the Lane but they do not do it justice. I LOVED this book and it packs a lot of punch in such a short novel. I do not want to get into spoilers and I am not sure how to talk about this book without revealing plot.<br /><br />I simply recommend The Ocean at the End of the Lane for any fan of Neil Gaiman.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book was much better than the first.  It had enough intrigue to keep you wanting to read more.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|From page one till the last page, this book was everything one would expect from Grisham. It told a story that is from the history of the old south and that is still to this day such heart wrenching. You will not be disappointed in this book. Gotta love Jake.
B00DD49R0E|5.0|If you enjoyed despicable me then you will love this DVD. The minions was the biggest hit of the original film. They realized it so this film has a lot more minions in it! Minions are hilarious! Enjoy the film!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Creative insight into a well-known story, with interesting applications for today. Once again, Malcom Gladwell stirs our minds to unveil well-established misconceptions.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I love this album!  It is original, creative, and fun to listen to!  After hearing the first song &#34;Up all Night...,&#34;  I wasn't convinced; I like the song but it is definitely not the best on the album.  The rest of the album is super cool!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This app keeps me busy while I'm waiting for all the Tv commercials to go by<br />really amazing app<br />never be bored again
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Loved this book... I read it throughout and am now reviewing it. Seeing some results already, even though I just started following the training method... Working on following the eating method also!!! I would recommend this to anyone interested in being bigger, leaner, and stronger!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thrilled to be able to crush on my kindle. wish the program had a undo button even if it only worked for one move
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|A five star game that occasionally freezes up. I have this app installed on my Kindle Fire HD. I am not really sure what causes the freeze. Fortunately it only happens between levels not in the middle of a game.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is easily the best keyboard I have ever used. And the fact that the team continues to improve the already awesome product is testament to their commitment, which easily shows to users like me.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|The talent in this video is so amazing ... If you love the Beatles and the Beatles music you will love this video...<br />I bought a 82\\" Mitsubishi 3-D TV right here on Amazon.com 2 years ago also Bose 7.1 surround sound system<br />OMG this Movie is so beautiful and sounds so amazing... Please don't miss this one and buy it in Blu-Ray ...<br />I promise you will love it...
B00F3VOL38|5.0|I have always been a big fan of the B.B.C. live session's involving any band I like! The wonderful thing is you get the best of both world's! You get the sound proof recording studio along with the Brits attention to detail & anal perfectionism with the sound board recordings along with the energy & personality of a live performance as well as the improvisation & deviation from the locked in stone studio versions we have all heard thousands of times. Everyone loves the spit & polish of a good studio recording but after so many years of hearing every note exactly the same its great to hear these classics done in a different way. And when heard Via the B.B.C. it sounds like a studio version. The Beatles grew up listening to the B.B.C. programs & went into those songs with all the excitement & energy of a live concert, & you get all of that power without the ambient noise of drunken fans screaming & yelling. It is also a joy to hear some cover songs I haven't heard from my favorite band that broke up some 40 odd years ago! What a wonderful surprise it was in the 90's when technology allowed the surviving members of the Beatles to get together  to work on some of John's unfinished project's two give us two new Beatles song's. Now in 2013 archived B.B.C. recordings are made available to revive the Beatles once again. What a treat for all us older fans & how great it is to add to the many great songs yet to be discovered by the young new fan's! To think that in ten extremely fast paced years the Beatles were able to create such great music & four movies, its amazing & then when you start to think of all the musical first's & all the accolades that they had earned its easy to see why a band that broke up so many years ago keeps gaining new fans every year! If those four men could have endured the insanity of Beatles mania & remained together as long as The Rolling Stones&#34;... well to quote John Lennon &#34;Imagine?&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you are looking for something to play every once in a while... then move on. This game will suck you in and you'll love it! But then wonder what happened to your free time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an unforgettable book.  The  writing is spellbinding and so unlike any other author's.  Through out the story, I felt as though<br />I was listening to powerful, classic music.  The characters are clearly drawn and so real.  In my opinion, one of the most exquisite  pieces of literature of our time.
B0093QJY0Y|5.0|It's a great a classic it's part of our modern world I don't want to say any more than that
B008J8KBKY|5.0|The three-dimensional aspect is new to me and challenging. That is good and probably very good for an old duffer like me. They say we elders should exercise our brains and this really does it for me. It is just plain fun but very rewarding when I win. I feel like accomplished something worthwhile and not wasted time.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The views and dialogue work because the reader accepts almost immediately that the author is a dog. The story has all the elements of life captured over a lifespan of a very interesting dog and his owner.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE this game and was so excited when I could get it on my kindle!! I admit you get mad but then it's lots of fun when you figure it out!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|An enjoyable puzzle game with decent graphics.  Liked the multi levels with increasing difficulty.  Did not like having to write a review to continue on.<br />Www.
B007WPM4P0|5.0|I really enjoyed this!  Well made and not your typical love story. It is not really wordy and really relies on the actors to tell the story.  The scenery is beautiful.  The tragedy of war is really felt in this film.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|...so not sure that it is applicable to every business. Some entrepreneurs may have different visions…<br />But then again, there are great deal of information that every wannabe entrepreneurs should know.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Read it while my Dad is in hospital. Thank you Ellen for the grief relief!<br />Can't wait for your next book!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty cool game, but some aspects are a bit tough. Like that you don't have to shake and tilt the tablet.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is enjoyable, easy to play and the different jet packs and bonus rides along the way makes things interesting and challenging.  Really,  the only thing lacking is the ability to save the distance you've gone. Not a big deal except it lacks an overall goal. My young kids enjoy it too.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|V for vampire , I got this game when amazon had it as a freebie it was played on my velocity micro cruz tablet there where no problems with game play.<br />I got into the game playing one or two levels a night some are easy and others hard, i'm going to keep this game and keep playing
B00902AKK4|4.0|Can't get the game to recognize that the wifi is turned on. Keeps coming up with the warning \\"Internal Service Failure. An internal error occurred.  This can be caused by a lack of network connectivity, please make sure you have a good network connection.\\"  This is happening on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Update: After redownloading it twice it started to work. Instead of doing the review over I left the original one so if anyone else was having an issue they would not give up on it. The game is worth having. It's cute and makes for a good leisure puzzle game. Good for all ages.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have been very pleased with the Duolingo Spanish.  It introduces enough content with each lesson to keep it interesting, with a good deal of review mixed in.  Repetition is the key to learning...or so I have heard. I especially appreciate the capacity to slow down the spoken sentence it is asking you to type.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the volume of material included for free without obnoxious ads!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|The other versions of Angry Birds are mildly challenging but Angry Bird Space is much harder. Now you have to deal with weightlessness which completely changes the dynamics of the game. No longer do our bird allies react like they once did. Still lots of fun though. Works well on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book may not necessarily end the way you want it to...but then again, whose real story ever does?  Despite the previous negative reviews  I thought this book was well written, surprising, and true to life.<br />I loved the part about how love is forgiving each other over and over again, and when it comes down to it, you don't choose each other once, you choose each other all the time, every day, every month, every time you fight, etc.<br /><br />This book evoked strong emotions, which is, after all the point of reading..and how you can recognize a good author.  Don't believe the negative reviews...read it for yourself! It finishes the series nicely, if not the way you thought it would go.
B007N85POS|5.0|In this installment of Angry Birds we have our heroic birds setting illegally cages birds free instead of killing evil pigs. Based on the movie Rio in graphics only this is a fun and colorful game. If you like the Angry Bird series you'll enjoy this one. Advertising makes it free but the ads are not over intrusive.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0307476073|2.0|I am an avid outdoors person; Hiker, backpacker, runner, camper, etc...<br />I was expecting that a book about a woman hiking on the PCT was going to be about trail descriptions,what to expect, what to pack. I also thought it was midleading because she didn't complete the whole distance. I wanna read about people who complete the feat!<br />It bothered me that she had left a great husband. Did she not know what she had in him?<br />Talk about condoms, being ill-prepared for the trek and so much self involvement reminded me of Chelsea Handler. I didn't finish the book...I just hope her ex-husband has healed from his<br />trauma with all the years  waiting for this woman to find herself
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is lots of fun. Not overly challenging but enough to keep you from using expletives.  Our Angry Bird friends are now characters of the Star Wars universe. They use light sabers, pod racers, laser guns and even the unbeloved Jar Jar comes on the scene using his tongue. You get the play the good guys and the bad guys with unique challenges to both. Extra bonus levels create a tougher challenge.  The is not finished yet but as they come up with updates we will be the first to play them. Music, graphics and sound effects are wonderful. It plays perfectly on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie. Probably not appropriate for younger children to be present given the violence. Probably wouldn't watch it again. 4 stars.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Put out the fires, save the villagers. Sounds simple doesn't it? It is, on the first level anyway. Eventually you'll have to put on your thinking cap. Very nice graphics, cute characters,  clever game play.  The only issue I have is that at times the fire hose can be difficult to maneuver.  Fun for the little ones but still good for adults who want to save lives instead of end them.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B008J05EL8|1.0|I can't get it to work at all. It doesn't work on Android / Kindle devices.  Definitely not worth any money or time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app, it freed up an enormous amount of space on my kindle fire. I recommend this app for all devices
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|Dream Theater have set the bar very high, and... while this has all the inventiveness, creativity, amazing level of musicianship and proficiency on all their instruments - something is missing. After having listened a dozen times at least, I still feel it doesnt measure up to their previous work.I will continue to listen, and expect that there is some unique aspect that I am not hearing yet, but... it seemed appropriate to set expectations.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Cool special effects, lots of action, but campy and the premise is a BIG reach beyond the laws of physics.  What's worse is the stupidity gets worse at the end, making it harder to remember in a positive light.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Nebula and Hugo Award winner. Massive amount of praise from the science fiction community. And now, a feature film almost thirty years after the novel itself was published. Of course, I had to finally find out the hype that's been around for years and years. Somehow this book never came across my path over the course of my childhood, and I do regret that now. For the kind of child I was, the intelligent kid in the room that was picked on relentlessly, this book would have had magical effects on my brain. Regardless, I still felt like I appreciated the book for what it is, even if there are a few things that do bug me about it.<br /><br />The intelligent boy, a social outcast, becomes the military leader the world needs in order to fight a force that has threatened humanity for a century. In a sense, a fulfillment of fantasies that many of us have had at some point or another. \\"You'll see, one day I'll be more powerful than all the popular kids.\\" And as far as I know, some people discount the novel for this very reason. But it is so much more than that. The politics and methods of war. Leadership. Prophetic visions of how video games will become (I give Card a lot of credit here for this particular point in general). It delved much deeper into such themes than I ever expected. Surprised me, even. And best of all, there was no forced romance throughout the novel. Well, not maybe the best, but a welcomed relief. We instead get the love between Valentine and Ender, the unconditional love of family. Bonds that can never be cut.<br /><br />We also see the bonds between soldiers and their commander. Almost familial, with great respect, but not quite the friendship Ender so desires throughout the novel. Isolated they want him and truly isolated he is, even with the others around him. We get a lot of what is going on with Ender psychologically due to this and other reasons, especially through the Fairyland game.<br /><br />And of games we get many. The Battle Room is the most exciting and action-packed venue of the story. Zero-gravity laser tag that freezes the suits you wear, with the objective to get your players to the enemy's gate. Game after game we get, with different armies, different tactics, and eventually different rules. The concept was amazing and fun to follow, though sometimes a bit difficult to reorient to what it would be like in such an environment. Though, Ender and Bean do help us with this. Always remember that the enemy's gate is down.<br /><br />My absolute favorite part of the novel has to be the big twist at the end, which I unfortunately feel like I shouldn't discuss here. Let's just say that I will never think of playing video games in the same way again.<br /><br />The one thing in the novel that unfortunately suffers from age is the Locke and Demosthenes scenario. While highly important to the novel, the concept of using what is essentially blogging to try and gain political power does not hold up in today's world. Where most of the book does not suffer from longevity issues, this is where a reader today would have trouble suspending disbelief.<br /><br />Overall, the strangest aspect of this book to me was attempting to reconcile it as a bildungsroman (coming-of-age story) when the characters were practically like small adults. Ender Wiggin is expected to save the human race as a rather young child, and as so I expected a great amount of character growth to occur. In many aspects, though, he remained rather static. He always is afraid of becoming a ruthless sociopath like his brother Peter. This point is again and again pushed at us through multiple different incidents that occur throughout the novel. Hurting others makes him feel like he will become as his brother is. Though I do feel that Ender does reconcile this, at least somewhat, in his mind with the events at the end of the novel. I figure I'll have to read Speaker for the Dead to see if this pans out?<br /><br />One thing is for certain. I will at least pick up a copy of Speaker for the Dead at some point. Ender's Game was one hell of a ride.east pick up a copy of Speaker for the Dead at some point. Ender's Game was one hell of a ride.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book has a very interesting take on the lives of people who lived and died during the Holocost.  It is narrated by Death, who actually becomes intrigued by, fond of several of the characters.  This is a bittersweet story, and quite unique.  I don't want to give it away, but simply want to highly recommend it.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|it was so cute and funny i have watched 5 times the sever guy was the witch who put the spell on the family
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I re-read the Shining before getting this.  This is a great modern day sequel!  One of the best King novels I have read in a long time!
B0073COMUW|4.0|This is a great product, no issues with flickering so far.  The light is very white, bright.  Just realize it does not have the warm glow of a incandescent bulb.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles so this is fun and stress free. If you enjoy puzzles then you will really enjoy this one.
B006QPVH6O|5.0|I don't watch scary movies but I do enjoy space movies....they are the kind of spook I can handle without freaking out at night. I enjoyed this one on the edge of my seat. It's spooky. Makes me wanna know more. I thought it was pretty good considering the premise.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|wow! what an amazing book. This is what fantasy writers should aspire to achieve! A Quest of Heroes (Book #1 in the Sorcerer's Ring) is one of those few books that plays to your imagination while at the same time gives you a story so thrilling, mysterious, heroic, and adventurous that it makes it VERY hard to put down. I have read many different styles of writing from many different fantasy/medieval books but, this book stole my attention and made for a heart-stopping, and fast paced adventure of a story! I certainly plan to keep reading this series and whatever else comes next from Morgan Rice.<br /><br />Happy reading and Seek the Greatest of Adventure Always!
B000000WZ4|5.0|One of the first DM cds I ever listened to. It was nice to get it again. It's so hard to find great music.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great, Superb, awesome, great movie, great characters. I would recommend to anyone. Not recommended for young viewers. Go see it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Cd was in excellent shape; no scratches. It didn't have a case, but it was well worth the value. A good buy.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I've been a Gaga fan since her first album, so this is absolutely a biased review.  But after Born This Way, I was worried ol' Mother Monster was having trouble finding her sound: don't get me wrong, it's a great album too, but the tracks are all distinct styles and it would be easy for a person to like a few but not all of BTW.  ARTPOP, however, has a much more unified sound.  And that sound is the sound of AWESOME.  When the delivery person dropped it off, I tore it open and haven't stopped listening to it since (7+ hours ago).  Her voice is as good as ever (and occasionally really shines even beyond normal), her lyrics are fantastic and range the gamut from serious to silly, and the beats are killer.  Buy it.
B006CUDDUG|4.0|Prepare to be completely lost for most of the course of the novel, and just try and keep up with the quality prose. Don't obsess over following the novel's every detail, everything will become crystal clear at the end. The denoument is truly something spectacular!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|25 Jan 2014 - I want to update my review and upgrade my rating for the Chromecast to 4 stars.<br /><br />The wireless N router that I was using previously was just the built in one that came with the modem from my cable provider.  It was crappy and was using it for a long time.  I have now changed my setup so that this modem is switched to bridge mode, and now I am using a new ASUS dual band wirelesss AC router.  The video on the Chromecast improved.  It looks very much like 1080p streamed from the net.<br /><br />I still did not give this 5 stars simply because of application support.  In Singapore, I am only able to use this with YouTube on my phone.  I tried Avia but it still need me to buy an add-on that will allow direct streaming from my phone.  And even when I tried to buy it, Play store did not allow which I believe is a country restriction as at now.<br /><br />Almost perfect.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />I'm using this only for YouTube and casting Chrome tabs only.<br /><br />Compared to my WD TV Live using the enhanced WDLXTV firmware with YouTube 1080p set, the videos via Chromecast were disappointing.  If you do not have a way to stream YouTube videos to your TV yet, then this is a good way start.<br /><br />Sharing YouTube videos on a big screen TV is always better than from tablets and smartphones.  Using your handheld devices like a remote is way better than your usual TV remote.<br /><br />Casting Chrome tabs is a plus.  Its wireless, so you can easily toggle casting on/off.<br /><br />Its cheap.
B00E8S2GJI|2.0|I got this version, with the digital version, specifically so I could add the Hobbit easily to my media library-- right alongside the LOTR trilogy movies, which I also bought with the digital versions. If you run your library through iTunes, DON'T waste your time on this one... It only works through this Flixster/Ultraviolet thing and their specific apps, which is useless to me as with the DRM garbage, it'll never work with my AppleTV. To watch, I have to download THEIR apps just to watch what I already own.<br /><br />Movie is awesome, and I can't wait to see the extended parts, but this particular version of the buyable movie is a waste as there was no actual notice, until I had to register for two more online accounts just to redeem, that it wouldn't work with iTunes, and thus it won't work with my digital library, and is basically a waste. Was I stupid for not noticing that this didn't have the exact same phrasing as the other movies I've bought and redeemed and can watch easily? Apparently so. The digital versions I have from Ultraviolet **also** mentioned the phrase \\"digital copy.\\" And I now know that if I can't see a \\"compatible with iTunes\\" label on the back, not to buy it.

B009CGGCSC|5.0|Look, we all know that some in this cast don't have the strongest voices. But the energy in this movie is outstanding.  My wife and I went to see a live production of the show just the other day, and I kept coming back to how definitive the performances of this case are for Mama Mia.  It's clear how much fun the cast had making this movie...it had to be a labor of love.  If you like ABBA, or like to reminisce about the 70's and 80's...this is a great movie to watch.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|Although the research was interesting, I found the story and the prose forced and the characters literally unbelievable. But then I should have figured that after the first best seller by this author.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|The entire story trudged along with the outcome having been glaringly obvious from about the middle of the book.  The reader is bogged down in details and legal processes without any surprise ending redemption.  Grisham has written better books.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Probably not as brony as others but yet I still enjoyed this movie, it totally is worth the buy, but no sure if enough to buy it on Blue-Ray, but yet is a good movie, totally worth even watched for a movie night in family or by yourself. The animation is cool, although might not be the huge fan of this type of animations but I like it anyway. Probably the thing that I enjoy the most was the songs, that might be the main reason why I was kind of interested on this movie, since the series show some cool songs, I knew that maybe one song would be my total fav, anyway, the movie is great, it's great option to watch, I bet as well as me you will like the music of the movie. character design might be hard to get use to see since all had senn them as ponies :P :P :P
B000NGTJTY|2.0|I remember a course in college which showed us classic Greek sculpture at its peak and then how it deteriorated over time, becoming a parody of itself, embellished with fancy stuff after the heart and coherence had run downhill. So it is with director Martin Scorsese. His early work had the purity and tightness of art. Now we get Hollywood dreck like \\"The Departed.\\" This was produced as a Hollywood insider tribute set up to honor Scorsese; that he received an Academy Award for it was a foregone conclusion, more a 'lifetime achievement award' than a true upvote for the film.<br /><br />It's unfortunate a Scorcese tribute would turn out to be so mediocre, poorly designed, overly long, and overpacked with big names, none of whom does a very convincing job. It's clear they are all just putting in cameos to give homage to Scorsese. Too many hard to believe plot twists, such as the hero and villain both somehow falling for the same woman - really? Way too much pointless violence, which just becomes fatiguing. Some producer, aware the movie was flagging, punched the \\"add more stars\\" and \\"add more violence\\" buttons too many times. Of the big names, only Decaprio offers anything like a solid performance; not even Jack Nicholson is very good here, playing the crime boss as a cutrate Batman Joker. Mark Wahlberg is particularly offensive as an overly aggressive, overly foul mouthed cop who cannot contain a never-ending stream of verbal abuse. This is so overblown I almost laughed. An appropriate part for ex-skinhead street thug Wahlberg, but just not credible. No such behavior would last a day in any law enforcement workplace, certainly not the conservative and beaurocratic Massachusetts State Police.<br /><br />Two stars.

0062107313|5.0|I am never disappointed in Amy Tan's novels. Having last night stayed up until the wee hours because I literally could not put down The Valley of Amazement, I raise sleepy eyes to tell you this is a brilliantly told story, but I warn you it is not for everyone.<br />Violet Minturn is half Chinese and half Caucasian, a child torn by her own identity. This story is about her coming of age at too young an age, and finally, as many people discover when they reach the end of their twenties, discovering their own self worth and identity. It is the story of miscommunication and estrangement, of mothers and daughters, of motherhood and childhood, of survival itself. It is the story of friendship and what it means to really behave like a friend. In this novel's surprising twists and turns, some less surprising betrayals and abuses, mothering is laid bare in its essence - simply having carried a child and given birth does not a &#34;mother&#34; make. Understanding comes late to children, often not until they have their own, but only if it comes from love and forgiveness. I have read some of the other reviews of this novel, and a few have stated that &#34;it's just another mother-daughter&#34; story. My belief is that that is like saying &#34;your mother/daughter story is exactly like my mother/daughter story&#34; which is patently not true. I never tire of Amy Tan's writing, although there are similarities. THIS mother/daughter story is not like any of the others although all are fraught with the usual misunderstandings, the teenaged angst and attitudes, the heartbreaking loss. I think it was risky and daring to place this story the way it was done, and these characters are not at all carbon copies of others in her stories. I never tire of them, and the story telling is so vivid that although this is not my personal experience, I can certainly walk with the author through this world of another woman's life.<br />All of this is set against the very disturbing and graphic background of the courtesan's point of view in a Shanghai business which caters to the many and various whims of sexuality. Violet has been raised behind the doors of such a house, but never intended to become a courtesan. Lest you think this novel is only the Chinese version of Memoirs of a Geisha, I insist it is not. It is so much more. However, you should know going in that the sexual foundation of the story is boldly graphic and unashamedly addressed from the very beginning. What makes it more palatable is the no-nonsense authorial voice, which seems perfectly in tuned with the no-nonsense approach of women whose very existence must depend on being able to function in that hidden society, being able to judge men and be judged by them. It is a compendium of the craft of seduction at least in that time and circumstance; it is a lesson without judgment on how far the human heart can stretch and how fragile it is.<br />The writing is gripping, taking you well in hand from the first paragraph and never letting you go. The characters are well drawn and evolving throughout the book, and the plot feels so real I had no problem imagining that these were very real people.<br />There is much in here with which many women will identify, then again there are stretches where I simply could not go, but still could accept the &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; offered.round of the courtesan's point of view in a Shanghai business which caters to the many and various whims of sexuality.

B00BATG18K|2.0|I was very excited to see this new Amy Tan book appear in my \\"recommendations\\" section. I thought it would be like a nice, warm bath. However, the primary emotion that seems to be portrayed by this book is pure, unadulterated anger. Now, there is nothing wrong with an angry book, particularly when the subject of the book seems to be the rampant mistreatment of women. However, I felt that the unmitigated harsh tone was quite unexpected coming from this author, and it made it difficult to slog through the 500+ pages without sinking into despair. This despair was not brought about by empathy toward the characters, but rather by the fact that neither of them seem to grow or mature.<br /><br />The book follows the story of a courtesan and her daughter in Shanghai in the late 1800's and early 1900's. There are some sections of very striking and elegant writing to which one has become accustomed from Amy Tan. You sail on these short parts of the book until you are abruptly deposited into a startling, dissonant narrative. Thus, the writing is incredibly uneven. I was not captivated at any point in the story, and I felt nothing toward the main characters, who were both portrayed as spoiled, bratty girls who grew into spoiled, rather gullible women. There was really no sense that anyone had learned anything, with the daughter's story arc being very similar to the mother's. In addition, while I personally have no issues with the language and sex portrayed in the book, there are only so many times that a person can read the word \\"pudenda\\" without some eye-rolling. Further, some of the more colorful language at times seemed forced and gratuitous, rather than authentic.<br /><br />All in all, I can't recommend this book for the reasons listed above. The story is meandering and in this case, unfortunately the writing was not enough to carry me through the less compelling parts.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This was another wonderful series by Jennifer Armentrout and the last book was a cliff hanger!  I have enjoyed these characters very much and am sad to see them go.  Hopefully a new series is on the horizon that we can enjoy.

While this movie was the worst one of the Resident Evil movies, I think they were just trying to wind the story line down so she doesn't have to continue the series.

B00DRZP2MG|2.0|Depeche Mode does a great job of scattering their remixes across formats: for any single, if you want to get all the mixes, you have to buy the 7\\", 12\\" and CD versions. This single is no different: all of the mixes on this vinyl single are unique to the vinyl release and you can't get on other official releases (they may exist on promotional CDs somewhere). Note: there's no 7\\" release of this single, just the CD and 12\\" vinyl.<br /><br />Typically, you can find some real gems on the vinyl-only singles. Some of the mixes of \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Soothe My Soul\\" (both from DM's 2013 album \\"Delta Machine\\") are quite decent!<br /><br />Sadly, this is an exception. Of the six mixes, only one is worth listening to (The Uberzone Remix). The rest are throwaway and completely uninteresting. Is it worth $15 for 1 mix? You decide, but I'd suggest avoiding this release unless you're an avid collector. Casual fans should probably just get the \\"Maps Remix\\" from the CD single (available as a single-track MP3 download) - it's the best of all the \\"Should Be Higher\\" remixes and the most economical.

0307730700|5.0|This is the true life story of Navy SEAL Adam Brown. This is truly an inspirational story as you see how one man is able to overcome so many obstacles to succeed at the highest level in the US military.<br /><br />What is amazing to me is that this is a story of a crack cocaine addict who is able through the help of the Lord God to overcome his addiction which basically had destroyed his life. His focus on being the best he can be through the military and defending his country is amazing. Over and over again the principles of patriotism, hard work, being a team player, family, and of course serving God above all come shining through.<br /><br />Although Adam Brown was by no means perfect, he is an outstanding role model for men today and I am very thankful his story is told. I hope that this story will inspire many others not to be a big hero in lifting themselves up but in being a servant to lift others and carry them. Selflessness is the core element seen over and over again in Adam's life and that is what it is to follow after Christ.<br />We need more true life heroes like Adam Brown!

B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|There is no denying that Lady Gaga has an amazing voice and can actually sing. And yes at times she may copy others, but what artist doesn't. After listening to the album two times through I can say proudly that I like this effort from Gaga better that her previous album Born This Way. But that does not mean that it does not come with its occasional misstep. Here is my track by track breakdown.<br /><br />1. Aura- a bit of a bizarre track, it fits well for the movie Machette but I don't know if it fits for this album. should have been a soundtrack only song. 3.5/5<br />2. Venus- At fist I did not care for this track, but now I love it definitely takes a few listens. Has an extremely catchy chorus. 4/5<br />3. G.U.Y- A neat song about a relationship with great play on words. 4/4<br />4. Sexxx Dreams- I just don't feel this song. There are just to many things going on here and none of them seem to mesh well together. This track is just BLAH! 2/5<br />5. Jewels N' Drugs- Absolutely Horrid song. The worst she has ever put out. I have now idea what she was thinking with this crap, it in now way fits in with this album and sticks out like a big red sore thumb..THE WORST 0/5<br />6. Manicure- This is a fun catchy track, very Rock. 3.5/5<br />7. Do What You Want- An obvious single choice. Just wow love love love this track. Has a great beat, chorus, and her vocals are great. 5/5<br />8. Artpop- Another great song its breazy midtempo and sort of robotic. its kinda hard to describe this one. 5/5
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|I love Bill Bryon's work but One Summer was just not that great. If you're into reading a lot of facts laid out in helter-skelter form, then it's for you. He jumps from one subject to another just when things get interesting and once you get back to that point, it's like--oh well, big deal. Byson's at his best when it's on a personal level, and with Katz, such as his travels in Neither Here Nor There, or A Walk in the Woods. The writing is good, but the Bryson magic (and his humor) is not here. If he was around in and involved with 1927, I'm sure it would have been a lot more interesting.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I bought the single for Woman's World this summer, and decided to get the album, too.  It's a great collection of catchy dance songs and ballads.  My favorites are Woman's World, Take it Like a Man, My Love, Red, Lovers Forever, Favorite Scars, and Sirens.  I think Sirens is the best song on the album as well as one of the best in Cher's catalog.  Red and Woman's World are my favorites of the dance songs.<br /><br />I bought the standard edition on pre-order, and two of the bonus tracks separately.  Then I saw the Target version and got that.  Get either deluxe version-they are both better than the standard.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is great.  I downloaded four different ones at the same time, and this one is the best by far.  They say everything out loud so you can hear it. The best part, is it's not just one method... you have to translate Spanish to English, you have to translate English to Spanish, translate what you hear, and translate what you see.  Plus, if you get it on your phone you can do the audio part (on my kindle I had to change settings to opt out of this feature) where you actually have to speak Spanish out loud!  And moving between two devices works - it still tracks your progress! Lessons are short, and they stick.  I have no real reason to learn Spanish, other than it's just something to do, and I crave doing it like any other fun game app I have!

Visually, it was awesome to watch, so maybe in theatres i would have liked it better. Charlie Day was the only entertaining acting in the whole thing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me hooked from the very beginning.  It is rare that I can read a book and not &#34;see&#34; the ending but this page turner fooled me.

B00FPH6AXE|3.0|This was a good movie, but the way of speaking took away from it. It was an odd accent to get used to and it seemed forced when the characters used it. A little slow in the beginning. Seemed like it was going toward action/drama, when it should have just been action and not try and force the drama and characters epiphany's so much. Visually, it was worth the watch.

B004I744AS|4.0|This works pretty good. I would recommend it to anyone who has the patience to write anything on a Kindle.
B000F8O35U|5.0|love it unopened and perfect its a movie I enjoyed as a little girl and now I can enjoy it with my three girls(5yrs, 3, 8mos)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Each chapter enticed me to the next! Can't wait to hear about what has happened to Jon Snow, is he dead?
B00CEB5QU2|1.0|It's not that this flash reader doesn't work. It does. But it only does so sporadically. Although it's been about a year since I bought it, I just now am finally so fed up with it, that I'm writing a review to warn others.<br /><br />For a few months after I purchased the reader, the main issue was wireless connectivity from my iPad and win 7 machine to the reader. The wireless connection between the computer/ipad and the reader would constantly drop and a connection, once established, lasted for just a few minutes before it the connection dropped. The MobileLite app on the iPad would no longer see the SD card contents. Frustrating, but at least I was able to copy files from the SD card to the MobileLite app's offline storage when I was fortunate enough to have the reader see the SD card contents. Still, I was so annoyed by this device that I put it in a sock drawer for a few months. What a waste of 100 bucks.<br /><br />A few months later, I decided to try it again today. I see that the MobileLite iPad app has been updated since I tried working with this reader last. Great, I thought, the kinks are worked out now. No such luck. Now I'm not able to simply copy a file from the SD card to the offline area in MobileLite app running on my iPad. I keep getting an error- the file I am trying to copy is 1.29 MB- hardly a taxing feat. The files on the SD card only sporadically come up in the MobileLite app even though my iPad is connected to the reader via wifi just fine, seemingly. Also, I am not able to open the files on the SD card. At least not reliably- sometimes I see a list of the files on the SD card on the MobileLite app and I can open them, sometimes I don't see them at all, sometimes I see them but can't open any of them (mostly PDF files under 5 MB). It's the uncertainty that's annoying. If you want a reliable wireless reader, stay away from this product. It's so bad an unreliable that it borders on a fraudulent sale.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book keeps expanding on the previous books.  It keeps you involved in the story couldn't wait to start next book.
034580404X|4.0|Story line similar to that of the Twilight saga although the sex scenes are much more graphic in this series.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really liked this game!!! it was like temple run but way more fun. I loved minion beach best.<br />my only problem is that it tends to freeze up at times which screws your game up and is super annoying. overall its a good buy and great way to pass time.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Nice underdog movie here. good action scenes, great acting group, added some humanity to it and the soundtrack was appropriate.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Great film - BUT - here - LOADS of extras on Blu Ray and only ONE - a short - on DVD. Oh dear oh dear. VERY ANNOYING. Those folk who only have a dvd player are left out in the cold yet gain. For Shame ! Lets hope for a Special Edition. Very measly and tight fisted of the folk at Pixar.
B00E0PT0FC|4.0|Excellent example of the kind of jazz-rock that Miles Davis hoped for.  Tight drumming from Harland, excellent groove, and some killer tone from Eubanks's guitar playing.  One of Dave Holland's better albums.
B004GYY714|2.0|Downloaded this one because Tunein Pro wasn't working right. Both versions now say it was interrupted as soon as you attempt a station.  It requests a forced close, and is currently unusable on my Kindle Fire.  What a disappointment!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All I am going to say is I really loved this book, Took me a while to finally purchase it after reading all the negative comments, but so glad I did. I normally do not read love stories but absolutely fell in love with this one.Would like to see the author do a follow up on the tale of Christian and Ana.
B008RF0M9O|4.0|I ordered generic headphone earpads for my Sony MDR-7506 and they fit perfectly. The ear padding is thinner than the originals, but they work fine. For the price I'm happy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought this based on other reviews but I wasn't really impressed. It was predictable and didn't really capture my interest.I wouldn't recommend it.
0399226907|5.0|great book; cant wait to read it to my 2 yr old grand daughter.  very well detailed for a young age
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The only disappointment was that this is the end of the series!  If you are looking for a great series to read, read Divergent, Insurgent, and then Allegiant.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. I saw things coming but I still loved it, it still tugged at my heart strings! I didn't want to finish reading it because I didn't want to read what I knew would happen, but once I finished it I cried like I hadn't cried in a very long time. Such an amazing book, and I hope John stays in control of the movie as well so that a director doesn't screw it up and change to much, keep it simple guys. I don't think if your an emotional person you should not read/listen to this while driving, or in public. You will cry, trust me.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is my go-to calculator app. Easy to use. Easy to see (no tiny print). Nothing fancy, just a great calculator app.
0789302691|5.0|I didn't realize it until I got the book...I had this book when I originally received it when I started being a member of the 10 club back in 1999-2000.  So now, I just have a newer version.
B008EL25LE|1.0|Not a fun game. Thought it would be similar to Azkend. Played a few stages and then got rid of it. I won't try it again.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|It's hilarious.  Book includes a few items from the best of the blog, plus a bunch of fantastic new material.  The single flaw of the entire book is that there isn't more of it.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|game. Challenging. Great graphics. The story doesn't have much correspondence to the game play but doesn't detract from the play.
B00GBCMW9S|1.0|Album is amazing. However, amazon cut the last few seconds from some of the songs. Will buy physical album next time from someone else.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Highly customizable. Great for changing tones, effects, etc. Great presets. Makes any device sound good. Definitely worth using. Easy on memory.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game with good sound and graphics. Enough change ups to keep it interesting. Looking forward to see how far I can go.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Really fun game. My boy loves it! I like it as well, fun game and good graphics. Definitely a keeper.
B002WVCRHO|4.0|Great movie. No slow parts.  I enjoy watching this again and again because it shows the resilience of the human spirit.
B00902AKK4|4.0|I haven't played this game much yet but it seems pretty good. Makes your think. The tutorial is helpful when first starting out.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Kept me engrossed. I watched the entire season in just a few days! Lots of surprises. Not too much gore.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I watched the movie several times and still want to watch more. It is a fantastic thriller and action movie. I liked the story and how the planned it.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Steven Pressfield extends on his themes that begun in the war of art and gives a clear and simple guide on applying those ideas to our projects. In the foreword, Seth Godin tells us to read it, then read it again. I will do just that!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The color and effects are great and I do not mind a challenge, but when I have failed six times I question the purpose.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|You know from the very beginning how it will all end. But we go along for the ride because it's a beautiful journey.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Let me be rather honest before writing this review, I'm not an enthusiast when it comes to reading. However, when I find a good book, I can't help but look forward to reading more. I enjoy a good book that has an immediate attention grabber; The Fault in Our Stars  has that. Green has such profound diction, such intense depth, and a sense of humor that is intelligent and at the same time understandable. I loved how Green also mused his book on a topic that is rarely touched upon: cancer. He put so much heart into his characters filling them with such palpable emotions. I've read the book multiple times and have enjoyed it even more than the last time read! Just note, you're going to need emotional stamina to be able to make it to page 318 (the last page). Okay? Okay?
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This certainly a life-changing book. I have Always heard of it and finally read it for myself. Wow. Truly life changing.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I am loving the triple part Nina is playing; tremendous acting!  Whose the best doppleganger?  Stephan/Silas vs. Amars/Katherine/Elena vs. Tessa/Questya?
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I've read many horror writers (King, Saul, Straub,etc.) and this Crouch guy makes most of their work seem like a musical comedy. Seriously. When I began reading, I went from thinking Hmm, off-putting, to disturbing, to starkly terrifying. Now I'm finished and must read Wayward. What it will contain is beyond my imagination. My dogs better not bark at ANYTHING tonight. If you like being scared out of your wits, join me, won't you??
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The movie is superb.  It makes you laugh, but still touches the heart strings in remembering the cultural biases in the deep south prior to Civil Rights legislation.
6305428042|4.0|This is one of our favorite Halloween movies and it was sure nice to be able to watch it this year commercial free.  Fast shipping and product arrived in excellent condition.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This is a challenging game, and is a lot of fun! Hours of enjoyment for anyone who loves a challenge.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|It was a very interesting movie, but I cant say I love it. its something that might happen and its not something I'd want to  happen. so I liked it possible awareness to a hazard and yet I know its a movie.
B004OR199G|5.0|Inspiring and helpful!!! Kris Carr has an amazing energy that shines through her book. It is very informative and she provides a great list of examples and recipes to help you get started.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|This thing works ok by itself except like everyone says it picks up ALL the noises in a room. So what I did to watch TV is I bought a 15 foot extension audio cable for $3.50 and place the mike right in front of my TV.<br />That makes this work excellent. I only hear the TV and no other ambient noises. For that reason if I could I'd give it a three stars without the extension and a ten stars with.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|I really enjoyed Ender's Game, however this book was truly a drudge to get through.  Terrible and unrealistic characters dealing absolutely pointless religiosity that makes every task Ender undertakes unwelcome.  Gone are the battles, the action, the thought provoking story telling of the first book.
B006LXQID8|5.0|I love this film, I am French, I have watched when it was released and several times afterwards. I always gives a good spirit.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm happy to finally have candy crush on my kindle fire! I haven't experienced any glitches yet. It's been a smooth app
B003B02O0A|5.0|John Grisham practically invented the legal thriller and this is the book that started it all. A wonderful story with belivievable and interesting characters.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Star Trek The Next Generation is a well written and well crafted t.v. show. I enjoy watching it. The show has some of the best characters ever created for a t.v. show. The show is one class act.
B00CITOS4A|5.0|Really enjoyed this book can't wait to read the whole series. Great tips for everyone, made a lot of highlights in this book and I can't wait to try out all the tips!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Gets a little boring after awhile. Something levels are kind of annoying. I hate their morphing chocolate levels. They are kind of creepy. Every one Andreas the then I think about un installing it. I am now on level 107, my daughter is on 240..I don't know how long I will continue.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was probably the best series I've read, and I so can't wait to start &#34;The hero's of Olympus&#34; woohoo!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Monetary is the best AROUND it is one of the best you can play it in your car and you can find BUTTER diamonds and iron+lapis and redstone
B0000041XX|2.0|I thought I was getting the whole concert from 1994.  This collection left out the hungarian march<br />with Mehta conducting and others by the three tenors
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased this because lightning fried my Ruko box. I wanted to get aplple tv but now is not the best time as the lighting also took with it a tv, router, 2 DVR's and more. Chromecast was my savior. We have been streaming on RoKu for 5 yrs and I missed it so much. The set up was very easy. The ability to control from our iPads and phones is awesome! My 5 yr old is now able to play his YouTube and Netflix on the big tv all by himself straight from his iPad. This is great, I agree with others that it can not totally replace my RoKu's features but I believe they will add more options soon. In the mean time I am thrilled that for $35 I am now able to watch my netflix, and hulu again. I will be adding a streamer in the future with more features but I believe that this product has its own little niche in the market. We will continue to use it.  I can now watch my stuff at the out of town visits to moms. Thank you Google from your biggest fan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|a real page turner.  Flynn keeps you guessing even when you think you've figured it out.  Some may be disapointed at the ending, but it's perfect when you realize justice isn't always served.
B000W93CXQ|4.0|Changes everything , There is a battle being raged, we can now all see it. We will win , we will fight back for lives .
B00G32VYDG|5.0|this movie is so funny even though it is a love story of sorts Jeff Bridges makes this movie great
B002GYI9C4|5.0|When I was younger I really enjoyed Fantasy. As I got older, I turned more towards Science Fiction. I definitely have a love and enjoyment for both. My main criteria for both is at least a semblance of believability. If I'm not exposed to your \\"system\\" (magic or science) by the end of the sample, then I won't purchase the book... because I have no idea what you're selling.<br /><br />Now, apologies for the introduction, but it builds for this book (and this series). The opening pages kept my attention, and then snared me. Sanderson creates great main characters (I felt the secondary characters don't really develop until someway into the third book of the series), and has an awesome and unique magic system. I was also blown away the \\"Ocean's 11\\" style plot. The characters all being a part of a rugged band with an impossible mission... what a fun and neat mashup of a fantastical world and something I would expect from a good movie.<br /><br />Mystery, excitement, magic, plots and plots. Read the series!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found that using Nikola Tesla as the figure to tie into the theme of fully utilizing one's imagination was a great choice, as Mr. Tesla's imagination and tenacity has helped to pave the way for many of the technical advances that we enjoy today often without giving the great minds behind them a second thought. In addition to a renewed interest in learning more about Nikola Tesla, what I came away with after reading this book is that although everyone has imagination, it's what we do, or don't do with it that can make all the difference -(maybe even make a global impact, as Tesla did)- regardless of whatever roadblocks or challenges are in front of us. I learned some facinating things about Tesla that I didn't know prior to reading this book, and will think twice in the future before becoming my own roadblock to following through on the next spark of creativity I may have. This was a fun, educational and inspiring book and I'm glad to have added it to my Kindle collection.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|What a wonderful work! So skillfully crafted and what a marvelous style Stoker chose! I just loved this book, every step of the way!
0061544493|5.0|Excellent book. Lots of great ideas and love her advice. She seems very good at this fashion thing. I actually trust what she says.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|Very cool movie! I've been lending this out to friends and family and everyone likes it. Of all the movies in my collection this one gets passed around the most!
B00DYFCZ2Y|4.0|I love John Legend and has fromt he beginning. I just wish the album was more uplifting like the first album. He has lost that ability to make me smile and want to dance.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|finally a game that hooked me....couldn't put it down and cant wait for a sequel!!  so many unique puzzels and amazing graphics.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has hit another home run in &#34;The Signature of All Things: A Novel.&#34; She takes you on such a wild adventurous journey from humble beginnings in Amsterdam, to the South Seas, to land in the United States through the eyes of a genius in botany.<br />She weaves an interesting family tale and takes you deeper into mind of a young girl whose entire world is shaped by her eccentric mother and father. She's fluent in 5 languages and is able to converse with all the great minds who come to dinner at the family estate, White Acres. You then see her flourish, fall in love, travel to Tahiti and live out her dreams.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Smart show but it's a little smug.<br />The rat guy is annoying.  He would be better cast as charming and handsome but loathsome.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|If you have an android and are not using this app, you are wasting time. Really. If you have an iPhone, buy an android just for SwiftKey. Seriously, I type an average amount per day, and this application / keyboard cuts the time I spend by at least half.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Loved it! Good sequel. Better than the edge of reason. Slightly predictable but still very happy with it. Love Bridget!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great story. I needed a break from the real world one weekend and this book helped with that fun read
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an inspiring book. A child is ripped from her family by Hitler's war machine. Thrown into utter chaos, she hangs onto life by the slender three of reading stolen books as bombs fall and loved ones are slaughtered. A war documentary like you've never read before---part history, part poetry;filled with pathos but always in awe of that which can never be crushed or defeated in our enduring human Spirit. Even death itself, that irresistible carrier-away of all mortal remains , stands speechless before ordinary people who are able  not only to stand erect but actually triumph even in the face of every suffering the world is able to inflict.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|Really enjoyed this story.  A lot of action and on the edge to keep you turning the page.  Good read.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is one of the smartest tv series ever.  Just good writing and acting making it a show to look forward to.
B0031RSBS2|4.0|This story not quite as exciting as the other Jack Reacher stories.  Too much travelling between Hope and Despair, tiring.
1442444053|5.0|I would give this book 1000 stars if I could! The quality of the book's paper stock  is fantastic as well. Richard Adams did such a wonderful job writing this most captivating story about rabbit life. I adore rabbits so much I never tire from reading it. Now I have the audio book and oh my..Ralph Cosham was truly made to narrate this story. He does such a great job as he brings the character's to life.
B0031RS44S|5.0|Another really good story, with the old crew back together.  Fast moving and action packed. Still keeps you turning the pages.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|I loved this book. I literally read it in one sitting i loved it that much. Beautiful story with lovely poetry. I found myself laughing and crying at times. If you like a good love story this is for you with some twists of life!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game! Graphics were beautiful and puzzles were challenging. I also liked how the hints did not flat out give you the answer but alluded to what you could try to figure out the answer. I can't wait for the Room 2 to come out!
B00275EHJG|5.0|One of the greatest and heartfelt animated movies I have ever seen. Pixar is truly made of magic. This film was fantastic!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is free and amazing I love it I can take all my vids for my family all in all I love it five stars
B001AVCFJM|5.0|A refreshing reboot of Star Trek. The acting is great, the visuals are stunning, and the story is powerful. What more can I say.
B00C0EA1TO|5.0|Great for both the movie and the special features if you're one of those people like me who don't have blu-ray.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. kills his performance of Sherlock Holmes. I hope for many more to come in the future. Bravo!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I can honestly say after waiting two years it couldn't be better!!! There are allot of fun danceable songs on this album and very good hits! I really like Gypsy,Venus,Aura,Applause,Donetella! Thank you GAGA!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Pretty good game once in a while got to reset system so it will  allow you to collect coins. Wish it was easy to get pearls. Kids love the game keeps them busy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is very addictive and it's finally on Kindle. I've been waiting seems like forever for it to be on Kindle and now I play it all the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft should be for free on every device. So I think everybody should be able to get it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|One of the  best free games around for both young and old. I would recommend this one to anyone e and I have some of my friends.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|One word &quot;Fun&quot;! Love it this game is great! Quicker paced than the original CastleVille. Hard to put down! Must go now, I have a kingdom to build.
B008I34YYY|3.0|To promote the president and maybe pick up a little hydrogen 3 on the side astronaut are sent to the far side of the moon. There they find that they are not the first to do a little mining. Yep the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP) has been there sense 1945. This triggers the plans of the NSDAP to take over the world.<br /><br />Will they succeed or will they only buster the president's chances for re-election?<br /><br />I tried hard to keep a straight face during the movie but they got me going and practically non-stop. One of my favorite spots is when everyone in the UN was trying to find out where the threat was coming from; each country denied it was their people. Then North Korea representative admitted that they are behind it.<br /><br />The acting was great the dialog pungent. There was a little too much potty mouth but it was not enough to be gratuitous. The CGI was quite adequate. The back ground music was not overwhelming the dialog. They did not try to be too campy. In all it was a well balanced movie with a big budget fee.<br /><br />It was nice to have the subtitles. However 90 percent of the German used was so fundamental that you could follow quite well at that pace.<br /><br />I look for more from this team:<br />Original story - Johanna Sinisalo<br />Original concept - Jarmo Puskala<br />Screenplay - Michael Kalesniko<br />Writer - Timo Vuorensola<br /><br />I will watch it again to see the nuances.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is fun but the fact that you have to wait for more lives is annoying.<br /><br />and it shows that you have abooster when you have to buy it. other than that inlove it
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Reads like a book that was always intended to be sold - and rewritten - as a screen play. Watch for it in your local theater.
B002P79KAC|5.0|Sheldon!!!  Never thought I would like a show such as the Big Bang Theory, just wasn't my genre!  I eat this show up and became an instant fan from the first viewing.  If it wasn't for Sheldon not quite sure I would be the fan that I am. Thank goodness for Penny also, for she is the conduit by which I understand the science of it all.  When he explains things to Penny, thus go I. If this was the only show I could watch.....I'm there!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything is magnificient about this show. The script, storyline, characters, setting, costumes, acting, actors and anything else I have failed to mention!  It's a show that can be watched over and over, always with something new and enjoyable coming to the forefront.  Thank you for this marvelous show!
B003SQVI54|5.0|This genre of show is likeable. The cast is so funny and laughable.  This show easily distracts me for the 30 minutes I need to unwind. Aging issues are so identifiable!
B008J8KBKY|3.0|4 IN A 3D ROW is &#34;just&#34; like the 4 in a row game from your childhood, except that it utilizes 3D space to do it.  This opens up a ton of ways to win (or to lose, as I found out).<br /><br />It's fun.  I'll probably keep it installed for a while.  I just wish that things were a bit more &#34;spread out&#34;.  It is sometimes hard to tell which moves are where, and occasionally it is hard to get the right angle to tap your move into the right place.  The 3D angles can play tricks on your mind.<br /><br />It's fun.  I picked it up as the &#34;free app of the day&#34;.  I don't think I would pay the regular price of $2.99 for it, but it might be worth a buck.  It does look nice, and it's a fun game, but I just don't think it is worth the normal purchase price.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|A must have! You have to get it I'm so addicted it's totally 5 stars why doesn't everyone have it
0375842209|4.0|Very we'll written... I loved the plot! I really had a hard time putting it down I know that sounds so clichés, but it's the truth .
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Great quality video for an awesome movie! If you love the idea of traveling but don't have the cash to do so, this is the video to watch. You get to see the beauty of Barcelona and get to see a very interesting love triangle at the same time. Win/win!
B00EVW04PE|4.0|The special effects were terrific it looked real.  It was totally entertaining.  I recommend this movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Not a lot of surprise at the ending.
1742204147|4.0|If you're considering buying this guide, you need to ask yourself a couple of questions first. 1. Are you a Japan/Travel Nerd? 2. Do you like to research? If you answered yes to both these questions you have found your guide.<br /><br />Some people like to travel by researching with Google and then making their travel arrangements piece by piece. Some people like to see a travel agent and have a vacation package planned out. And some people...uh... want to know more about a place than people who live there.<br /><br />This is truly the everything (including the kitchen sink) guide to travel as it seems to list absolutely EVERYTHING a traveler would want to know. Is there a system or organizing this info? Is it thorough? Does it have easy to understand and useful info? Yes, yes, yes. But if, like me, you are a busy person who doesn't have time to thoroughly research EVERYTHING about a place you are traveling to, this might not be the guide for you.<br /><br />As for myself, I'd like a color, lavishly illustrated glorified travel brochure that shows you the highlights of a travel destination. While this book is excellent, it's really for me at this stage of my life because I'm transitioning from the super nerd to the busy professional, and yeah, I'd like a guided tour handed to me when I read a book on a subject, not an encyclopedia.<br /><br />If you are a nerd for all things Japan, or planning to go there for an extended stay (or just are a travel research hound) this will undoubtedly be the book for you.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|City of Ashes is the second book in The Mortal Instruments series.  The transition from book one was smooth.  As for second book, City of Ashes, it followed along the same path as the first.  The loss of stars was as follows...<br /><br />To read the rest of my review, go to my blog at catalleyreadthis.wordpress.com/hello-readers-of-the-world-2/city-of-ashes-the-mortal-instruments-book-2/
0316226130|3.0|Now, that the Twilight hype is down and looking back I almost now realize how much grammar erros Mrs.Meyer had done with this book, it very much had a lot of potential, but if I think about it. I might as well write it all again and make it more clarifying for a reader to get, or \\"hate\\". I didn't like the ending that much as I'd like the movie version, which would have been a lot better written in the book; perhaps this last book would have been a lot better than the sappy original. I honestly think after reading tones of reviews over and over, that Mrs.Meyer really did rush into this book.If she could have waken up 'from another relentless fascinating dream' maybe this last book could have done her more justice than the first one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is so moving, full of adventure, love, tragedy, and death.<br />so hard to put down this book!  loved it do much.
0545586178|5.0|This book was even better than the first one in a FANTASTIC WAY, every chapter was filled with depths of adventure in a torturing way. You feel as if your riding the Everdeen roller coaster. This is a definite must read, before the new film comes out November 22nd. If you have not read this book yet, PLEASE what are you waiting for, GO PICK IT UP!!! EVERYONE GO GET A COPY OF THIS!!!!
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Fun to play with and hear what the spirits have to say to you.  My kids get a kick out of it.  We just bought a 170 year old home and the machine goes nuts!  fun and creepy at the same time!
B00F35BV64|2.0|Been a Star Trek fan all my life, and was looking forward to the latest installment. Was hoping it was going to be an improvement over the previous release. As my guy summed up, it was \\"oh-kay\\". Didn't mind missing large chunks of it (to get a bite, answer calls, whatever), which seemed more like a PS4 game than a movie anyway. The story line had promise, but went overboard in digitized uberkilling.  Extra scenes of completely unbelievable \\"action\\" was tiring. I also pine for the day each story gets away from using time travel in some fashion. I'm scared to see what JJA has planned for Star Wars....Sigh.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game keeps my mind working while trying to match the pieces.  Fun to play a quiet game by myself at times and this is it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Extremely addictive game. If it didn't take time to get new lives I'd never stop playing. Its also very challenging. I love it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is one of the best series I've seen. I could hardly wait to see the next episode. The characters are truly believable in their portrayals of the country way of living in the beautiful English countryside. Perfectly cast are each and everyone of the characters. I highly recommend seeing all the seasons.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Loved the legos for my 5yr old neice.  Great product! Her brother loves legos so this gives her a chance to play along side him
B00EEPFOH6|4.0|The Place Vendome project is comprised of Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Unisonic, etc) on vocals, Dennis Ward (Pink Cream 69, Unisonic) on bass, Uwe Reitenauer (Pink Cream 69) on guitars, Gunter Werno (Vandenplas) on keyboards and Dirk Bruineberg (Consortium Project) on the drums.  As on the previous album, the songwriting is provided by different musicians. Timo Tolkki (ex-Stratovarius, Avalon), Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear), Alessandro Del Vecchio (Hardline), Tommy Denander (Radioactive), Brett Jones, Sören Kronqvist (Sunstorm), Andrea Cantarelli and Roberto Tiranti (Labyrinth) make up the songwriting team.  The music on Place Vendome's third album is a mixture of the previous two offerings. The sound is more guitar oriented compared to Streets Of Fire and more AOR focused compared to the debut album. A good mixture of melodic hard rock and AOR with plenty of hooks, good dosages of melodic and heavier riffs, some astonishing solos, lots of keyboards and tight rhythm sections.  Although the instrumentation and the production shine it is vocalist Michael Kiske who steals the spotlight once again. For one more time he proves that he is still in perfect shape and probably delivers his best performance with Place Vendome. The songs contain a wide variety of vocals, although this time Kiske focuses more on the higher end of his range to great effect.  The melodic hard rocker &#34;Broken Wings&#34; and the soaring &#34;Thunder In The Distance&#34; are the stronger of the heavier songs. The up beat and uplifting &#34;Never Too Late&#34;, the energetic &#34;My Heart Is Dying&#34; and the melodic &#34;Lost In Paradise&#34; offer some very solid AOR. The dynamic &#34;Heaven Lost&#34;, the power ballad &#34;Maybe Tomorrow&#34; and the mellow &#34;It Can't Rain Forever&#34; are the best of the slower songs. In all the mentioned tracks you find addictive harmonies, memorable choruses, impressive guitar work and stunning vocal performances.  Even though the album is extremely good, it is not perfect. The opener &#34;Talk To Me&#34; is energetic and catchy but similar to the song Streets Of Fire from the previous album. &#34;Hold Your Love&#34; and &#34;Break Out&#34; are two average songs that could be labeled as filler.  Thunder In The Distance is on the same quality level as the project's previous album and a definite highlight for the melodic rock genre. If you enjoyed Place Vendome's previous releases buy this now! If you are into melodic rock or AOR, definitely give this project a listen.
B008D36INE|2.0|Turned out to be rather slow moving yet curiously disjointed & unsatisfying lack of character depth so that I never really connected with characters.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is a massive, intense wall of digital, well-mixed rock and roll. If they were trying to prove something, they definitely did on this CD. The DVD could have had a couple of extra songs, maybe some concert footage thrown in somewhere. Otherwise, this CD blew me away. Jesus is the rock and roll of my salvation.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|It is a wonderful movie.  The only reason I gave it only four stars is because the original Cranford was better.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Why Does This App Require Precise Gps Location? There Is No Reason A Game Like This Should require This New Permission
B003UESJH4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  All the actors did a wonderful job. I knew the king had a speech impediment and it was great to learn how he conquered this handicap.
B0091VYG86|5.0|Special plot twists. Special film coloring. 1950's Nostalgia. Good Actors.<br />&#34;Father Knows Best&#34; meets 1990's suburban LA High School Culture.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, just because of its bulk.  Other than that, it is easy to set and easy to read.  It's the first silicone banded watch I've had, and really is pretty neat since it doesn't shimmy-shake on your wrist like metal link bands do.  All in all, this is a terrific watch!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Use this app on my original Kindle Fire.  It is quick and efficient.  Space is critical on my Fire so I use this app to clean old programs and cached.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Though this game is not truly free, the amount of gameplay options is incredible! Not long ago I purchased a similar App for my Xbox 360. The application on the Kindle has nearly twice the options the Xbox 360 version of this application contains! Defintely worth the money!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|A little more than half way though the book, I just gave up.  Moriarty seems to be trying to make the story intriguing by adding numerous characters who eventually meet but it just doesn't work.  A lot of the book just isn't very intelligent.
B000P0J074|5.0|You know you love this movie. Tim Burton directed it. Michael Keeton is BeetleJuice. All-star cast and great story telling. Buy it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I could barely put the book down!<br />I would say the first 60 pages or so are boring but then there is soooooooo much action!<br />You just HAVE to get this book!
B002UNXSBS|5.0|Simply a classic. Depp is great, the story is excellent, the execution is fantastic, and the movie came out wonderful.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I have only heard and seen Lindsey on utube, and she seems quite talented, along with the beautiful scenes. If you like her music, I must tell you about someone else very similar who changes the music unlike anyone I've ever heard that plays the violin. Listen to David Garrett. I feel like he is a 21st century Mozart. He is unbelievable and in my opinion, beyond amazing.I have bought all of his albums since running to the tv when I heard his music on the Today Show.I crave more of his music, and that is why I'm viewing Lindsay.
6305077630|5.0|One of the best. If you have ever seen this movie, or if you have even just seen bits and pieces, you know there is a reason you're looking at the DVD. Buy it. This one does have all those classic lines in it as well. No editing.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Everything about this series felt forced to me. I wanted to like it, but I never became attached to any of the characters and the plot was flimsy. The writing isn't bad, which makes it readable, but of all the dystopian novels that have come out in the past few years, this is one of the least enjoyable that I've read, and the least convincing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is easy enough to play and enjoyable. Too linear for an extended play game but for the time needed to play it will suffice for cheap entertainment.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|This series is a sort of guilty pleasure; a kind of reality t.v. soap opera. I don't feel any strong attachment to the characters, but the plot is interesting enough. The writing isn't flawless, I sometimes find myself jolted out of the story by a phrase or a word that seems 'off', but over all it is entertaining, and I like that it takes a dystopian world and blurs the lines between good and bad, making it a more believable situation.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I join all  those who have enjoyed this engaging fiction story. It is not only well written but also much more entertaining than the TV series. I will acquire the next volume as soon as  I finish this one.
037571457X|5.0|What do you think of when you hear the phrase \\"graphic novel\\"?  Most of us, I believe, have visions of comic books or maybe science fiction or fantasy stories full of little green aliens or mythical visions of things never seen on earth.  As the parent of a young child, I'm also familiar with the rise of graphic novels to appeal to younger or more reluctant readers.<br /><br />This book is definitely not for very young readers, and it turns the comic book paradigm on its head.  It is the profoundly - even brutally - real coming of age story of a young Iranian girl growing up in a radical household just before and during the Islamic Revolution and the fall of the Shah of Iran.<br /><br />I am no scholar of Iranian history and even after reading this book twice, I don't feel like I have a very solid grasp of the history or major players in the Iranian political scene.  But that knowledge - and the accuracy thereof as presented in this book - are only secondary to the story itself.  This isn't meant to be a history book.  It is the story of one girl's experience of the transition from the freedom of boing about unveiled and attending co-ed classes at a French school to being veiled, separated from her male peers, and living in fear of her own government.<br /><br />If you are of the belief that children should be seen and not heard, you will not like young Marji.  She is spirited, outspoken, sharp-tongued and sharp-witted, almost to the point of being sassy, and most definitely irreverent.  She has been encouraged to read above her age level and think for herself, and she doesn't take kindly to propaganda or conformity.  She demands the right to bring her voice to the world at large - by attending the same protests as her parents.  Until the protests get too dangerous for any of them to attend.<br /><br />Marji learns little by little that the events, people and ideas she is protesting are very real and how her life is directly impacted.  At first she is very proud to have an uncle who was imprisoned and she basks in his reflected glory as a hero.  Until he disappears again.  Other people that she knows also disappear, get tortured, and get killed.  Despite her seeming irreverence and flippant attitude, Satrapi deals with these events head on in a way that confronts the reality of the horror and anguish for those who lived through the period.<br /><br />Marji is also confronted by what it means to be female in Islamic Iran.  Her parents have raised her in a very egalitarian way to stand up for her rights equally with men.  But the introduction of forced veiling is only the beginning of Marji's education in femininity in a totalitarian regime.  She learns why virgins can't be executed and how they work around that.  She has a run-in with the women's branch of the Guardians of the Revolution.<br /><br />Marjane Satrapi's story is full of humor and pathos, warmth and contempt.  It is the story of what free people face and what they will endure to hold onto even scraps of that freedom, even in the face of loss, death and constant fear.  It is both heart-warming and heart-wrenching.  It also confronts us personally, as we learn that there are few clean hands, even here halfway around the world.  I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to truly understand our shared humanity in all its glory, with all its faults.have an uncle who was imprisoned and she basks in his reflected glory as a hero.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This album is one of the best pop albums I have ever listened to in a very long time. I purchased it for my brother, and ended up falling in love with it as well. Very enjoyable, and FUN. If you are looking to be up-lifted by some good music and powerful vocals, this is the album to purchase.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app you can do so many things all free. This is not one of those things that are free but you still have to pay to get good.  Even though if you want you can make in-app purchases.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Is is the real, updated design to catch the rubber seals on newer lens. Nice tight fit. Not much Else to say.
B00005MNP7|5.0|Blondie's 4th Record from 1979 just before the best decade in music began and years before I was even born...This album came out before the famous \\"AutoAmerican\\" in 1980 that launched Blondie to New Wave/ Post Punk Royalty, originally released with 12 tracks this 2001 CD re release features 16 tracks... We of course have this amazing lineup of the beautiful iconic Debbie Harry with vocals, Clem Burke on drums, Jimmy on keyboards, Chris Stein and Frank Infante playing guitar and Nigel on bass flying this record to #1 on the UK music charts. I love all of Blondie's albums but this one sometimes goes fogotten and yet it has so much to offer, I have owned this re release since highschool! 5 STARS
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really don't understand what all the hype was about. This book really was not that good and the characters are so unbelievable. Don't waste your time.
B000ESSTKQ|5.0|What an AWESOME album it was in the early 80's several years before I was born! What an AWESOME album it is today in 2013...TIMELESS CLASSIC and this re release remastered album version is just perfect... lately I have had \\"Photographic\\" on replay and I Just Can't Can't Get Enough Depeche Mode! I can't say I have a favorite DM album because I love them all, but it all started with \\"Speak and Spell\\".
B006LSZECO|3.0|Started as such a page turner and ended so flat, so annoying- couldn't wait to finish it because it became ridiculous.  The ending truly ruined this book.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman is a short animated film based on the childrens book by Raymond Briggs. This inspirational film came out in 1982, several years before I was born. The film is scored by Howard Blake with the exception of the nostalgic song \\"Walking in The Air\\" sung by a choir boy Peter Auty of the St. Paul's Cathedral. The Film was directed by Dianne Jackson and produced by John Coates. May John Coates R.I.P. This film features an introduction by one of my favorite Artists David Bowie in the 1983 release. Some of the animators involved include Arthur Butten, Tony Guy, Hilary Audus, David Baillie, Vicky Emptage, Vanessa Clegg and others. I know that Hilary Audus and Dianne Jackson were the Storyboard artists. John Cary was the film editor. This Film reminds me of my childhood everytime I watch it in which words cannot describe. I would watch it with my Grandmother and Great Grandmother and it would bring comfort through my parents divorce. I also played the song for my daughter the day I brought her home from the hospital after she was born. I laid with her caressing her head listening to this beautiful tune. I have shared it with those special in my life as well. Today at 28, this film still brings tears to my eyes. With it's soothing pastel colors it brings an aura of magic and innocence. This film takes you into a journey of love and hope, but most of all a friendship between James and The Snowman. Full of emotion this film has no speaking and that is where the wonderful music and soft visuals take you on the journey.Such a simple tale yet so heartwarming it gives you comfort in any struggle that you might be having in your life. The joy of your inner child is any remedy known to humanity to those who embrace it. The ending is sad and painful yet a reminder of reality and that the memories that James shared with The Snowman. These memories between this friendship will live on forever. The memory of sneaking The Snowman into his home and of flying through the sky while visiting a faraway land and meeting Santa Claus as well as other Happy Snowmen is priceless. If you haven't seen this film its a must! Now as a father I relive the magic every Winter when I watch it with my daughter. This Film is very special. Enjoy!visiting a faraway land and meeting Santa Claus as well as other Happy Snowmen is priceless. If you haven't seen this film its a must!

B00006IM9Q|5.0|As a longtime fan of Blondie and the 9 albums to date, I am excited for the 2014 release of 'Ghosts of Download\\", if you are looking to get a piece of Blondie, this \\"Greatest Hits\\" is the best one that has been released by them, I usually prefer the genuine feel of actual albums rather than greatest hits but this one is a must... The sound quality is fantastic and all the songs are Awesome! A perfect starting point for anyone interested in getting to know this amazing band. 5 STARS
B008602KQI|5.0|It was almost as good as the books!  The cast was well chosen, and while I will always love the written form....this was a nice watch.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I liked this book because being a mother of a toddler,  I can relate my current situation with her. I think every new working women should read this book. Some of the work related things that she mentions are so true. I feel sad that I cannot overcome them and become a true leader like her. I feel more so because my culture taught me to do certain things. However, this book is about keeping our hopes high as a women in leading roles in spite of all the social and cultural barriers. I would be interested to know how many men have read this book ...
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Great movie - it will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of the whole movie.  What a movie!
B0060YIBLK|4.0|A good practical guide to establishing interpersonal contact.  The methods described are easy to use and should help anyone be more comfortable around other people.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun, chanlenging, and I don't have to be on-line to play.  I'm glad it has been added to the Kindle family.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Great, original fiction from Hugh Howey.  I read this based on the number of 5 star reviews on Amazon and didn't regret my purchase at all. This book is a real page turner and as soon as I finished it I had to buy the Shift books straight away to find out more about this fascinating world created by Howey. I will definitely try other books written by this author.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This book gives me a new reason to live. Remember to always consider your choices, and think before you do. Everyone needs someone to be there for them. I have a band new aspect on how I look at things in life:)
B007EW9ISM|5.0|It is difficult to think of enough things to say past the arrived on time, in good condition, love the product (that's why I ordered it), and had no reason to contact the seller.  This is why I click excellent.  When everything is A-OK, it's the best rating to give and hard to put into words, so I think 5 stars should be sufficient.  Very useful and amazing to use with my cell phone.  A legally blind student uses one of these on his I-pad and loves it also.
B00GEJS6GG|3.0|Here's yet another movie from Marvel Studios--Thor: The Dark World. The trailers looked like typical blockbuster adventure trailers, but they did promise a big fantasy in worlds far from our own. I tempered my expectations, though, after being disappointed with Iron Man 3. I must admit that I'm somewhat of a sucker for big fantasy adventures. I was hoping that this would indeed be better than Iron Man 3.<br /><br />If you're expecting spectacular imagery and intense action, you'll find it here. If you're expecting plenty of funny gags, you'll find those here too. Tom Hiddleston steals his scenes as Loki, but all the other actors are effective too. The whole thing is a pretty wild science fiction high fantasy mash-up, especially with the somewhat convoluted, but still fairly coherent, plot. I really don't have much else to say, as what you see is what you get and the movie is indeed typical.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a story. The writer takes what could have been a slightly dull story a couple of pages long into an extremely well written book that examines two people's travel, people whose lives were intertwined though they did not meet for decades after the war, through the war. Sometimes this would be a bad thing, sometimes a good thing. In this case, the result is excellent.<br /><br />One interesting that that I learned is that the German fighter pilots were as jealous of the Spitfires and Mustangs as we were of the BF-109 and FW-190. German fighters were typically faster and better in dives than Allied ones, whereas Spit's and Mustangs could out-turn the German ones.<br /><br />A very human story that even non-military or war buffs will love. Highly recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I first heard SK was writing a sequel to the Shining ... possibly my favorite modern horror novel ... I couldn't believe it. Then, I became nervous. So much time had past, both the author and his audience are very different now in hyper informed '13 than pre Star Wars '77. Well, I'm delighted to say that not only is Doctor Sleep a great sequel, but it's a great novel in its own right. characters and themes are reverently re-captured, and new ones added to enhance the mix. While the story wasn't what I expected at first, after reading,  it's exactly what I wanted it to be.
B00CAEVVYS|1.0|Kay (Meryl Streep) and Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) married for 31 years. Their marriage is getting stale and they are becoming more like business partners. Kay wants the magic back and forces Arnold to go and intensive course with Doctor Feld (Steve Carell.)<br /><br />Actually the actors look a little better with some age on them. The primes are not that interesting. The excision is mechanical. It looked like each character was acting by his/her self and they just patched it together to make a film. It's like watching Dr. Phil on steroids.<br /><br />The film starts to get repetitive and then just quits.
0786948523|3.0|Fourth edition D&D sucks, plain and simple. I played as a kid and the rules made so much more sense. Maybe this time around they'll listen to the players?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game.  I have in on my kindle and my phone.  Something to do in doctor's offices, etc., any time you have time on your hands.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|Not as in-depth as I had hoped, but there is a lot of story they tried to pack into 2.5 hours of screen time. They did a good job of interpreting the book, left out stuff they could, kept what they needed. It's been fun to watch these actors grow up on screen, too!
B005544V6A|5.0|Now I know what all the talk has been about! Very fun show, solid acting, entertaining writing. Can't wait for the next episodes to air!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a moving and nuanced take on one of the seminal moments in American History. Watching it reminded me how complicated and delicate our democratic process is, and how hard it has always been to find compromise in the face of strong opinion.  Day-Lewis towers over this production, one that every American should watch to see what greatness involves.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|This is a wonderful story of a talented and forgotten man. It is so touching when he finds his recognition. He is a modest man with a great talent and he passes his values to his family.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini weaves a net that draws the reader in. I went through all the emotions, trying not to laugh out loud or cry while on the stationary bike at the gym. Looking forward to his next book and my next journey.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This lil app has been great for me. So intuitively designed, using it for many applications was a joy. Nicely done AVG Labs.
B000YHG72E|5.0|At the time that Elf first came out, I like many others had fairly low expectations for a Christmas movie with Will Ferrell in it. I was completely blown away. This movie has all the fun, laughter, heart warming and tear jerking moments that a Christmas classic should have. It is at the top of my list of movies to watch every year during the holidays.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these primarily for very long haul airplane flights, when I wear headphones for up to 8 hours at a time. With the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions they exceeded my expectations. When playing high quality digital recordings on my computer (FLAC) the sound was terrific. Of course playing MP3 format was disappointing but through no fault of the headphones.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|It kept freezing & it only has videos from all the up & coming Disney kids. ....bummer..... It's like an so w/ a preset song list.
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Consider for a moment that, after all this time, we can have the joy of receiving and listening to a NEW Beatles album.  We are so used to the endless box sets and out-takes that our favorite geriatric bands keep pumping out.  It is easy to be a bit jaded about each new release.  Somehow, I had faith that the Beatles would be different.  Thank goodness I was right.  BBC vol 2 is very satisfying.  It is not earthshaking, of course, but it is very good over all.<br /><br />In my opinion it is definitely better than BBC 1.  The track sound is clean, and it brings you back to when the Beatles were new, and the interviews let us relive the newness they felt too.  Their musicianship is solid.  The performances are more inspired than BBC 1.  There is more banter on this album, but they don't overdo it.  I can say that this one will be on the track listing quite a bit longer than the average new disk I receive.<br /><br />However, for people still getting started in Beatlemania, I would recommend starting with the standard UK releases, in particular Rubber Soul and Revolver.  Then you can start adding the oddities and rarities.  The best of these \\"others\\" are Anthology 3 and Let it Be Naked.  This new BBC 2 follows those two.  As such, it is certainly worth having, but not at the expense of the original releases, Anthology 3 or Let It Be Naked.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am now reading book three and am caught up in the lives if the characters! There is more to these books than the hot scenes you hear about!

I obviously don't want to pay every time I die, I wish there was some way I could earn lives quicker... but I LOVE this dang game!!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|addictive game. gameplay is very good. I have played other games that had an on screen d pad and it didn't go well none of that here good control good graphics and fun

B00ECUARO8|3.0|movie was slow...really slow.  It was borderline dull.  The storyline never went anywhere..there was no real progression.  The kids were cute.  Of course, as in every one of Matthew McConaughey's movies, his shirt didn't last long and the remainder of the movie he went without a shirt - predictable.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very fun for this type of game, the only<br />Thing I would change is h o w slow the cut scenes are.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the challenge! Can't wait to play again, everytime I put it down!!!! Always sending things to my friends so they will return the favor!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is so much fun.you get to play cool games.but the only bad thing is you half to by things with real money.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is so inspiring! It kept changing my emotions so that I was happy at one point, sad at another and then happy again!!
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|the HD added so much more to the movie and the better sound track. thanks for a great evening of entertainment!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think the minion rush game is adorable. I wish it didn't cost money to do certain things! But overall very good, especially for children.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like how all the pieces are on the side and can be scrolled through instead of having them all on the screen and have to move them around to clear the area. Easy to find all the side pieces to get started. Best puzzle app I've come across!
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Good movie! Better than I expected. Great quality audio and video through Amazon as always. Cool special effects. Godzilla for the new generation!
0316204366|5.0|When you have kids that struggle in school, you want to read this. I learned a lot from this book that I will keep in mind with my kids. It is very comforting and eye opening. Gave me a different perspective about success in school - life.<br />Malcolm Gladwell is a fantastic writer. I love his books!
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Great movie! One of my favorites. Totally worth it. Brand new in plastic and everything. Came on time. No worries with this one.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|A great album. I've been a fan of KoRn since 1993, and they are still one of my all time favorites. The songs on this album are excellent. Great to see the band reunite with Head, and their composition reflects his return. With some elements sounding like old KoRn, the new KoRn album is a must have. Haven't taken it out of my player in my car for several weeks now. Favorites are Prey For Me, Love and Meth, Mass Hysteria, and What We Do. Watching the Reconciliation video is great, but makes me wonder what happened to &#34;Kage,&#34; as it sounds like a great song that didn't end up on the album.
B0060CV6ZA|5.0|Was cutting egde CGI in its day. I enjoyed it when i was a teenager and enjoy watching it now.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|What a wonderful series! I had just finished all available episodes of the wonderful &#34;Call the Midwife&#34; and was looking for something else to dive into. This was a great choice -- it centers on a hamlet (Lark Rise) and the neighboring market town (Candleford) in late 1800s rural England. Great characters, interesting explorations of the class divide, love and hate, poverty and riches, togetherness and loneliness, and so much more. Thoroughly entertaining ensemble acting -- I'm already almost through Season 3. Downton Abbey lovers will be pleased to know that Brendan Coyle, who plays Bates in DA, is one of the major characters in this: Robert Timmins.
B00GMONG90|5.0|They are truly amazing...i fell in love with them the moment my sister introduced me to their music...love how they arrange the songs😊💙🎧

B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app makes eBay so incredibly user friendly and is organized into sensible tabs. I love it so much!! I would recommend it to newbies AND experienced users.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|I have been a huge Gaga fan for many years.  I have bought every album and every remix EP.  I can confidently say ArtPop is GARBAGE.  I am so disappointed.  Drugs are distorting her creativity.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|The vocals together are sweet!  The choice of songs fantastic.  I have played it over and over again and love it more each time.  I recommend this album to everyone.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|It is not as good as the first two Ironman movies.  No real character development.  Visually it is an amazing movie.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|This review has a few spoilers.<br /><br />I apologize for being \\"old-school\\" and therefore being really disappointed with this attempt to update Superman.  Actually it's beyond disappointment...I hated this film and what they did to the hero I grew up with.  This is of course a personal opinion only...a lot of folks liked the film and who am I tell them they are wrong?<br /><br />There wasn't one redeeming quality about it at all, well maybe one.  I didn't give a crap about any of the characters including Superman.  The dialogue must have been written by the same people who wrote \\"The Brady Bunch,\\" especially Kevin Costner's dialogue.  There is absolutely no warmth or emotional attachment between any of the characters, even between Clark and his earthly mother, Diane Lane who played Martha Kent.  Even the make-up was terrible; the older Martha Kent looked more like a crack addict than matriarchal.<br /><br />The tornado scene was absolutely ridiculous.  Why didn't Clark rescue the dog?  He could have easily done it without giving away his secret.  Instead he lets his father push him away pretty much knowing dad is a goner.  And did I miss something, didn't Lois Lane and everyone else already know that the alien was Clark Kent from Nebraska, so what was with the ending?  And what was with the suite?  There was no explanation why there was a suite or why it had those colors or anything, it just happens to appear on a ship, put there by the dead Krypto father 20,000 years ago.  How fast Lois and Clark became an item?  The casual way earth accepted the news about alien life?  How quickly Lois and the scientist were able to understand, interchange, interconnect, blah blah General Zod's ship's drive field with Clark's baby ship's drive field blah blah and send everyone except Zod back to the Phantom Zone? I could go on and on about the things I didn't like about the film and I hate that I spent $30 bucks to buy it.<br /><br />Maybe I'm totally off the mark and not getting it.  Maybe if I was 16 or 17 I would have enjoyed this version of Superman, but I'm not, I'm 56 and remember Superman from the old comics, Saturday morning cartoons and the 1978 version of Superman with Christopher Reeve.  The only thing I saw in this version of the story that impressed me were the special effects...excuse me...CGI; therefore the two stars.g it.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It is easy to play.  It charges back up if you wait.  There are ways to pay for upgrades if so desired.
B000EUDAWG|2.0|Moves very slowly and is small. Looks cool but not for the price! Should have just went to nearest toy store to compare them.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Game is a great game just wish it was easier to get diamonds. I love hidden objects games. keep them coming.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|love twitter.............its free, follow entertainment, politics, sports, breaking news, weather, you name it you can  follow it, pics too..if you dont have you gotta at least try it....hello ..its free
B00338QENI|4.0|I thought the story was eye opening to what went on in America and probably still does.I enjoy true stories
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|A little over simplified but is a good time killer will play it for a while maybe it will grow on me.
1451683405|1.0|......then what use is it to try and persuade people that there is no free will?  I cannot figure this out.  Can anyone help me in this regard?
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good story from the start.  For me it was a page turner.  I only have time in the morning to read a chapter, then I can't wait for the next day.  I say to anyone that this a buy book.  (^_^)
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This tells us how utterly depraved some people are, and how fortunate we are that Jaycee's experience is not a common occurrence. That such a thing could and did happen is frightening.
159463176X|1.0|It's just heartbreaking to really be into a character and eager to know what's next and then POOF!  Turn the page and that character's gone never to be heard from again.  Mr. Hosseini creates these delightful, lovable, multidimensional characters and kills them off in cavalier fashion. I have about 30 pages to go and I can't finish it. I'm done.  Very annoying.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Pretty good I hate waiting for lives though. I like the Facebook friends because I always want to beat them.
B005JE1JZC|5.0|Lyrical and compelling. And I think I just formed a Wit bond with my cat. It must be feeding time.
B00FRYJHZI|5.0|I love everything about this soundtrack. Let's hear it for Belgian/Dutch Bluegrass! They get to the core of the music. The heart of it. Beautiful and tender soundtrack for any relationship breakup worth its weight.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Action, Drama, Acting, Tension, Smart, Story and a sprinkle of Sex - has it all. This one screams for marathon watching in vivid and pristine blu-ray colors.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The 3 stories that come together as 1 make it interesting.  It has surprises and twists that make you keep on reading.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|One of the best movies this year.  Well casted, and visually stunning.  It leaves me hoping that they just keep on going with more and more.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Could have been a 5 star, except for the abrupt (and to me disappointing) ending.  Wonder about keeping or ever joining another Social Network!!!
B00DW36G32|3.0|Not so much, I liked it enough to finish it though.  But I felt like they could have done more with it.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This series keeps on getting better! It hasn't lost the focus on the PEOPLE on the show. How the characters interact and deal with one another in this extreme situation is AT LEAST as interesting as how horrifying the walkers look as they are being put down!<br />Can't wait until next week's show and the return of the Governor! Two big thumbs up!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|V for Vendetta is a thinly veiled analogy of what has taken place duing the Bush-Cheney years. A brainwahsed population basically nodding their heads in agreement to whatever their government or the news media puts out as the truth. One man cuts through the bulls*** to empower and educate the citizens to fight back and take control of their destinies. The operative catch line in the movie, \\"People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people\\" has probably been adopted as a rally cry amongst Tea Party zealots in this country, although they'll never really grasp it's context. And maybe that's what writer Alan Moore wanted. Hugo Weaving plays the title character V with Natalie Portman as his reluctant accomplice in mayhem. Good supporting cast with the always reliable Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves. Well worth watching but the graphic novel packs more of a punch. After this review I'm sure I'll have the NSA on my ass.
B002FFVF1G|5.0|I have always loved Doris Day movies since I can remember- these are classic movies that I can watch over and over- and I look forward to renting or buying my favorites- thanks
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|A gripping, shocking, thoughtful, and thoroughly enjoyable movie. Denzel Washington was magnificent! The supporting cast was outstanding as well. Definitely worth watching and more than once.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I loved &#34;Walking Dead&#34; from Season 1. Each season it gets better and better. The characters make you feel like you know them. I root for each of their survival in this horror they live in.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|The Man of Steel 3d collectors edition is a must have for all superman fans. Watching the movie in Imax 3d was great and now owning it at home for 3d will be just as great, watching it in the comfort of my home. I recommend this movie for all comic fans and people in general, you won't be disappointed.
0446581356|5.0|What can I say, Bobbi Brown is one of the best. Enjoyed the book and am using her info everyday at work. I work for a cosmetic company.
0140157352|4.0|Classic book on negotiations. Even the most soft-hearted individual can be a great negotiator when you focus on interests over positions and creating value all around, and the book is extremely applicable and worldly.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Didn't think i would like since it was referred by my wife. Ended up being a good read after all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! Hands down the work of a genius! It works really well on my kindle fire. Highly recommend!
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Glad we don't have to wait a whole week to see what happens next. Great series. Watched from season one on amazon.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|A great look in to the consciousness of a girl of that period...and you really get a sense of life in the Vermeer household  Also of what it takes to be a great artist.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Loving every season. Plot twists and turns each episode. We end up watching 3-4 episodes a sitting bc we want to know what happens next!
B003O86FMW|4.0|After reading the Hunger Games I looked forward to book two.  It was very good.  I didn't really appreciate the cliff hanger ending but here I sit awaiting book three
B008Q08IV4|5.0|the movie is about all that can be good in us, human beings. By looking at things in a very simple moral way Forres Gump becomes a success without really wanting to be. he is not conceited, he's modest. Of course one can quickly determine he might not be capable of 'forming the intent' as they say. he is everything one should try to be. He falls in love, but to his dismay; it's not reciprocal so he patiently waits for his love to come back to him.<br />Very few movies tap into these particular feelings, and this movie does it very well without being religious.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Refused to try for a long time but now I am not sure why. Fun and gives my brain exercise. I would pay for a version though that didn't ask me to buy things all the time.
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|I's vintage Paul, just as expected. His voice is better  than  I had hoped. I only hope it isn't his last.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's a great game. It has great graphics. And almost all of the robots are cool. Buy this game NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is very entertaining.  The graphics are interesting and beautiful.  I gave it a review, but it asked me to review it a second time.  I would like to continue and get to see the other pictures.  So far it's been good.<br /><br />I love this game and want to marry it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun fun fun and highy addicting! No more needs to be said about Candy Crush! Everyone should play it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I wish there wasn't so much &#34;Jesus, Mary and Joseph&#34;. The profane use of their name so often are it almost difficult at times to get through.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoying the light to medium challenges.  Good graphics, smooth movements across the screen, and I Hate being forced to use a minimum number of words of characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy the game! Was very glad I was offered it for my Kindle Fire. Happy, Happy, Happy, .:-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game. I have been playing this game for a short time but I really enjoy it. It is very addictive.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Great read. It's got something for everyone. This was my first book by Diana Gabaldon and I bought all seven books in the series plus the four book series of Lord John. I read all seven books of the Outlander series in two weeks and I can't wait for the eighth book that's due out next year, 2014.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|love this show!!  keeps me guessing at every turn and I've grown to really care about the characters. when I  started watching the series I thought oh this will be dumb but really it's an engaging insightful  show.  plus  Norman r. makes it worth watching.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|set in a future where androids made of organic parts but lacking empathy can be hunted down and killed. Philip K. Dick brings this strange place to life. you choke on the pervasive radioactive dust. you bleed when a rock thrown at an odd religious man hits you. you root for the animals that, rare and revered, are introduced to the protagonist. and you wonder at the alternate universe that takes hold in the background of your mind.<br /><br />breathtaking, if you dare to let go. like bungee diving.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very good i love how they did the compititions  so well done<br />the compitions the horses just so beatiful<br />love it.
B001EC3JME|5.0|THIS WAS THE SECOND Nite Ize LHS-03 Clip-On Flashlight Holster IVE BOUGHT, AND IT'S WONDERFUL FOR ON DUTY POLICING. HOLD LIGHT WELL, AND HIGH ENOUGH NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF SEAT BUCKLE. WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THESES. QUICK SHIP. GREAT PACKAGING. SEE YOU IN ABOUT 4 MONTHS!! WORTH EVERY PENNY.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Really creepy and scary.  Truely terrifying story that is simply told but keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it - but I was hoping for more.  The video from my Chromebook is VERY choppy at best (even on the lowest setting).<br /><br />Surprisingly, everything I cast from my phone is PERFECT.<br /><br />Using the TV as a monitor is not bad either.<br /><br />Its worth the $35 - I am hoping they come out with better versions.
0375413405|5.0|If you like french food which I do you will love this book. The techniques and recipes are awesome. Thank you Julia!
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|Lots of the concepts are not new and covered in other pyschology books, neverthless they are delievered in a convincing and interesting way. A worthy read.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Great fun to watch MacGyver get out of jams with his many makeshift inventions.  Richard Dean Anderson, who also starred in the Stargate series, is so young as MacGyver.  I love the catchy theme music.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great read. Extremely hard to put down. Extremely smart storytelling. Lee Child has outdone himself on this one. I hope the next follows suit.
B000V39KDO|5.0|I like this movie it wasn't too long or short it was so real like what you face today in life! would buy or watch again
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome it is a great book for young teens This will be one of my FAVORITE books
B001MM28JG|5.0|Wonderful satire of shows like Star Trek - but can run on its own merit. Showed this for the first time to my  wife this weekend (I know, right?) and she couldn't stop laughing.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|By the time I got through these three books, I had to admit they were a pretty good indictment of current society, plastic, uncaring, affected, and viciously materialistic.  I didn't like the books though (or the movie).  The characters seemed a little two-dimensional and the plot lacked that fundamental connection to realism that makes fantasy actually really work.  Although there were plenty of worthwhile parables and metaphors for contemplation, I just didn't find the entire universe of this fantasy believable enough to make it rise above the level of &#34;meh&#34;.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|I thought it was a good movie but it was way too short. Graphics and scenery were amazing but the movie was over too soon.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|I, as many others, did not read instructions (who has time for that) and thought this was junk until I removed the plastic screen protectors from the front and back.  Now my wife took it and won't give it back.
0596101996|5.0|Very, very pleased with the book. It's worth every cent! The writing is clear, paced and suited for both the expert and the non programmer (like me). You'll learn JavaScript, with great confidence and in a very light manner.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|Cecile McLorin Salvant has a voice.  To call it &#34;rich&#34; is a huge understatement.  She is a throwback to all of the superb voices that have come through the age,  while maintaining her own individuality in song.  She's got such a magnificent,  wondrous, soulful voice it's hard to put to words.  You feel everything she is,  all the emotions that go into producing that sound,  you experience right along with her.  She has a way about her,  a gilded batch of tentacles that reach through and into your soul.  You will dig it.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|This was my first Longmire read.  It has spawned the desire to read them all.  Very clever dialog and believable story line.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift  for my 8-year old nephew. He has been a  big fan of LEGO products and really loved this item.
145162445X|5.0|He  offers  an  excellent  and  logical  explanation.  I  had  to  read  it  twice  to  put  the  pieces  together.  It  helps  to  view  his  lectures  on  you-tube,  probably  before  reading  the  book.  A  brilliant  mind.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This is probably the best cd this year. Best Eminem CD Yet. You Must buy it. It is really awesome!
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Such a good movie - makes you believe!  My husband really likes this movie, requests to see it every year
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|These are all 4 of the Beatles performances on ed Sullivan show featuring such songs as help ticket to ride I saw her standing there from me to you and many more all original commercials and some bonus features as well a must for Beatles fans
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a powerfully captivating book.  Expect it to keep your turning pages,.  Probably his best book out of all he has written.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Phenomenal.I love it so much. The best feature in my opinion is that it notifies the weather to you and it provides accurate info.it would be 5 stars, but it can sometimes be confusing
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I needed to understand this creative giant better. He was driven by his vision and passion.  It hurt me badly that the cost to his personal life was so high.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love love this game. Thank goodness it has a time limit because I would be on it all day.
0345803485|1.0|Disgusting! All I could think of after reading is I wanted to rewind my brain to never having read any of this crap!  No one who loves someone does this kind of thing to them! We were all appalled at the real life terrors of the 3 young women who were victims (sex slaves) of Ariel Castro - yet when the media hypes something like this book people don't realize how damaging this is for women.  Makes me sick!
B0091VYG86|5.0|Great movie! This is the kind of movie you could watch over & over & over & over & over!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is fun, challenging, and highly addictive.  I cant seem to stop playing. it is aggravating as well, the jelly squares can be a challenge
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Update. 3 months later, this device still doesn't work on my downstairs TV. Google of course has not addressed such issues, so if it works, great, if it doesn't, you're on your own. Skip this and check out EZcast; it works much better and isn't locked down like this device.<br /><br />This device is still in the premature stages. It doesn't work with all HDMI ports on all TVs. On mine it works with one tv's HDMI ports, but not the other TV. It's a problem, and there is no support from Google on this. The casting is pretty basic at this point, you can't even cast the movies you made using your phone/tablet camera. Basically you are locked into casting only \\"bought\\" media, or your web browser. Would definitely not recommend wasting your money on this at this point until it can be used to its full potential.
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|Fast Pace, entertaining, and makes you think.  Love the movie. I would reccommend it to any adult.  The violence; however, made me decide not to allow our 12 year old son to watch it.  It was just a little to intense for the young.
B00AHG9KYE|2.0|The franchise deteriorated with each passing book.  2001 was brilliant, in my opinion.  I've read it countless times.  2010 was very good, although what I might call the &#34;kumbaya factor&#34; was already rising.  2061 was a moderately enjoyable read, but throwing Heywood (or a clone of him) into the &#34;immortal spiritual aliens&#34; pool was not at all credible, and the overall story arc wasn't terribly interesting.  In this book, we are told that an astronaut floats around in a vacuum for one thousand years, and somehow survives.  And that's just the silly premise on which the book begins.  The rest of it is hastily thrown together, and features many tedious, banal letters written between characters (&#34;Dear Penthouse Forum, I never thought I would see the rings of Saturn, if you know what I mean&#34;*), among other shabby devices.  I won't try to read this one again.  It wasn't as bad as the later installments of the &#34;Rama&#34; franchise, but it's not worth the effort.<br /><br />I'm glad there were no further installments; I'm pretty sure there would have been a family reunion, including all the guys who were in suspended animation in 2001, along with Moonwatcher and the other apes from three million BC.  This week, on a very special episode of Space Odyssey:  &#34;Moonwatcher want HAL make grog, grog GOOD!&#34; *canned laughter* &#34;I'm sorry, Moonwatcher, I'm afraid I can't do that.&#34; *canned laughter* &#34;Now Moonwatcher has sad, go on killing spree.&#34; *hooting and shrieking noises*<br /><br />*Yes I made that up.  The actual letters are duller.

B00CWY76CC|1.0|I put a hate on here, which isn't really fair. I just could NOT figure this game out no how, no way and it was very frustrating! Others may love it, but I have no common sense and I think with this game you need it.

1936891026|5.0|This is a great book that is a good read for anyone young and old and can enlighten you to yourself.
B004G8QTS4|3.0|Too much lingo.  The interesting part is that the author does some good research on the Southern California area and lifestyle.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Grandchildren love this game. Good for hand eye coordination. Would recommend to anyone with children. Girls as well as boys.
B005MRXS78|5.0|A fun item to have for panning and tilting your camera with, especially with the use of the remote control device. Price is reasonable.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|Lots of fun but the popups to buy more options make it a game I cannot let my grandchildren play without supervision.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Overall, I wasn't impressed with this book. I had a hard time getting through it, it didn't grab my attention and force me to read as the other books in this series did. The science experiments seemed dull and stilted. The explanations around genetically damaged and genetically pure were utterly absurd. I think the author was trying to get at a chilling, Hitler esque idea around race and purity, but it was ineffective. I work in the field of science and was disappointed in how ridiculously science was portrayed in this novel. But worst of all, how boring it was.<br /><br />The shifting perspectives was a neat idea, but poorly executed. Tris and Four's voices were so similar as to be interchangeable. I like the idea of the author exploring how Four's abuse shaped him, but it ended up feeling very shallow, somehow lacking a believable voice, depth, or something.<br /><br />The main reason I am giving this three stars rather than two, is that I do appreciate that the author took a risk in the end and ended it in a way that she must have known would be unpopular. I've read many YA series, and this is the first one I can think of where the author dared to *SPOILER ALERT* kill off the main character. I like that. Many other YA books explore war and sacrifice and hardship, but it doesn't impact you in the same way when you KNOW the main character is safe.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|powerful and moving, great actors<br /><br />I had my daughter who is 15 watch with me as she was assigned to give a debate on civil disobedience vs use of violence, and felt she couldn't argue the use of violence side which she had been assigned.  This is a remarkable story of when violence is justified, although not successful.  She thanked me after she saw it, she said she truly understood both sides now.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|This is a great album!..Different than \\"Black Radio\\" in that its more radio friendly and less adventurous musically....Have read other reviews from musicians complaining that its not like Black Radio. I play guitar and have no issues with it! He's said on interviews that he intended to make this project more radio friendly and I think it will get heard by more people!...Musicians calm down! I don't think he's abandoned us!! LOL!!...This is still better than 99% of the stuff on radio!!
B002SJIO5E|4.0|A wonderful film that brings Sci fi into apartheid in South Africa. There is much to think about as you watch this film. The choice of actors and nationalities is interesting. Much of it reflect the struggles that this planet goes under every day.
0316322407|5.0|Such a strong and wise young woman. Solid character beyond her years. An inspiration to all women and girls.  Highly recommend the book.
B000H1RFKU|3.0|I very much enjoy Denzel Washington and the film and story line is great. I  really enjoyed the film. Well done story and great Blu-ray. I pretty much only use Blu-Ray discs, unless I really want the film and it is only in DVD.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|This CD is actually my second purchase, as a gift to family. I am a loyal listener (since early '70's) of music produced by the Eagles.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|Not a bad movie on DVD. I purchased used and it was broadcast originally before 16x9 television or HD was normal. It is in old fashioned 4x3 so I set it up to stretch so the screen was filled. A well done film for a broadcast movie. I would very much like it to be available reformatted in HD.
0374533555|3.0|Isn't that an absurd question?<br /><br />That's the way I felt about many of the so-called experiments conducted by this 'Frazier Crane'. As one reviewer noted, this can be dangerous stuff when used by governments to maximize societal happiness. I believe one can gain useful insights into our thinking processes from this treatise, but you have to take it with a grain of salt. The book is full of psycho-babble.<br /><br />I wouldn't go out of my way to read this, but I suggest flipping through it a bit.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Really a prequel for Alien, it is a very well done and well directed film. Ridley Scott did Aliens better than the others and this one matches up. There are some things that can be argued against but that is just opinions. Good stories, fine effects and as usual, great story line.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Steinbeck's characters and their interactions with life and each other don't tell me what to think of good and evil. They invite me to think in shades of grey, and about good and evil.  Outstanding writing that has stood the test of time - - a sign of genius!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A wake up call delivered in an entertaining no-nonsense way.  This is not your typical self help book.  Choose Yourself is written from the perspective of someone who has failed miserably and has also been wildly succeeded in life.  James presents his personal learnings in a non-preachy or &#34;I'm smarter than you way&#34;.<br /><br />I think his main point is that only after being healthy from a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual perspective can you then have the energy and clarity of thinking to come up with 1000 (mostly bad) ideas and then pick 2 or 3 good ones to pursue.  This path will allow you to take control of your life vs being controlled by others or things that you may choose to own.  Something like that...<br /><br />Check out his blog as well.  Very well done.  Hugely entertaining at worst.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Quite the tale and it's thread is absolutely incredible. Several times I just burst out laughing wondering how the heck Jonasson could have thought that up. I enjoyed every page.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Shallow, heavy-handed, totally lacking in the wit, subtlety and sense of irony I'd come to expect after reading &#34;A Hologram for a King&#34;
0385349947|5.0|Loved the book so much, had to buy one for each staff member!  Sheryl's phrase &#34;lean in&#34; is a short cut to reminding people to take a chance and communicate fully!  Very well done.  A must read for all females in the workforce and a wonderful way to educate their male counterpart!
B000U6BT40|5.0|Intelligent, quirky sci-fi storytelling with a light heart, sense of humanity and humour. Eureka has characters that you will enjoy loving or hating.
B00280LYIM|5.0|this book was amazing! I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Rick Riordan did an amazing job of of interpreting a lot of information of Gods and their Greek legends. It was the book that got me into reading again, I swear once you pick it up you won't put it back down until you've finished it.
B00DSO9RMC|4.0|I approached this book with mild trepidation  after reading some of the reviews on here.  It seemed like people were saying the evil publishers were milking the cash cow one last time by taking advantage of a sick guy etc....<br /><br />I read the whole thing in 2 1/2 hours as it was simply unputdownable.<br /><br />Maybe not the greatest Discworld novel ever but we all have our favourites Mine being a straight draw between The Truth/Nightwatch/Small Gods/Mort/Monstrous Regiment/Jingo/Unseen Academicals/Feet of Clay/Lords and Ladies etc<br /><br />But a very good one nontheless- better than the last 2 it leads on from some of the events in \\"Thud\\"<br /><br />Some very good twists at the end 8 out of 10
B00464AVXW|5.0|Good quality CD but with no extras.  I purchased this movie to replace my video version.  I'm a Morgan Freeman fan and actually forgot Brad Pitt was in it.  It's classic Morgan Freeman.  Brad Pitt's character has an attitude leaving him with a two dimensional character that yells and swears alot.  It's really quite disappointing that he wasn't given more to work with.  He did an excellent job for what he had.  For anyone that hasn't previously seen this movie, I advise some parts are quite graphic.  If you don't have a strong stomach you may not want to watch it while you're sitting at a tv tray eating dinner.  Gwenyth Paltrow should be mentioned, she plays a smaller role as Brad Pitt's wife.  It's a good twist on an old theme: serial killer.  I want to reach through the screen and choke the life out of the killer myself.  You'll love it!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I just haven't played it enough to learn how to do it correctly and make more points.  I think I will enjoy it when I have more time to mess with it.
B0090X4GLW|2.0|The musical presentation and quality of the sound tract is excellent.  My low rating reflects that I did not like the musical - both the book and musical score.
B000HL09SA|5.0|We like a story about kids and their dogs.  This was well done and enjoyable.  It showed how much a dog can mean in the life of a boy.
0446555002|5.0|All the Pendergast series books are great!  This was the last book of the Helen Triology and I couldn't put it down!  A real page turner!
B001MSMULG|4.0|Mr. Silva writes closely woven mysteries that entertain the casual reader.  He has done well to find a new enemy to challenge the Cold War dramas.
B006O2QNOU|3.0|It started good but ended lousy. The actors acted great, ending of the story was not satisfying.<br />The message was not clear.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This game is amazing. I usually don't buy apps but this one is well worth it. Defiantly a good buy, first good rpg I've played on the kindle fire that I actually could follow the story and love the characters AND the gameplay. If your thinking about it stop. Just get it and thank me later.
B00DONVMFM|5.0|I was given Downton Abbey Seasons 1&2, as a gift from my daughter, and her family. I was vaugely familiar with the first season, having seen bits of it on Netflix. After watching season one, I took a little break, thinking pethaps that season two might need to be viewed a bit later. What a surprise was I in for! Season two, was every bit as delightful as the first season, the story line was as good or better than season one. After finishing season two, I immediately ordered season three.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love it when Superheroes come together and battle &#34;the Dark Side&#34;.  Takes me back to my childhood days watching the Justice League of America.  Still missing Aquaman...just saying!
B00CDTSFF8|4.0|Actually I give this show 4 1/2 stars. Naturally I expected some liberties to be taken. I spotted some immediately, but figure they were using the incorrect timeframe on the attack at the Lindisfarne Monastery, to add drama. This is where the Lindisfarne Gospels were being created. I thought that the actual attack by the Vikings at Lindisfarne was closer to the later part of the 8th century. The early 9th century was about the time frame that the Book of Kells had to be hidden, as the Vikings were invading Scotland and Ireland. The Lindisfarne Gospels date back to either the late 7th century, or early 8th century.<br /><br />I understood that with this series would come gore, but I think that it was not overly done. Truly, I did expect far worse. I feel that there has been an honest effort to get the story of the Viking invasion out, to those not familiar with how these events unfold in the course of history. Had the Vikings not invaded, the world would be a much different place today. True, they were seen as barbarians, but then these were dark times.<br /><br />I am curious how Rollo will finally find his spine, and become a great warrior, or if he will remain a shady sort. I see the jealousy and envy he has for his brother. Envy and jealousy that runs this deep has to result in some sort of deceitfulness, or evil action against his beloved brother Ragnar. I would think that the betrayal wil be a brutal one.<br /><br />I anxiously await season 2 to be made available on DVD.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|The genre of animation has grown quite a bit in the last couple of decades. When movies like Finding Nemo came out years ago we got to experience how much could be done with this genre. As more and more films came out the law of averages prevailed, some were good, some were pretty bad, and only a few were truly great. That is why I stopped watching everything that came out in this category and tried to concentrate on those I thought were gems. I am not sure why I never got around to watching this movie, but now I realize that I was missing out all these years.<br /><br />Let's start with the biggest plus I found. The story is absolutely enthralling, with a plot the overflows with imagination and provides the audience with a nice combination of laughter and tender moments. There may be a few scary moments for little kids, but these are truly few and far in between, and as soon as they figure out that the monsters are actually more afraid of the kids than the kids are of the monsters, it goes away.<br /><br />The voice acting is what actually takes this film to the next level. John Goodman and Billy Crystal deliver with their voices better performances than many actors can deliver when acting themselves in films. The inflection in their voices, cadence and emotion provide the story with an added layer of awesomeness. Finally, the animation and graphics are really stunning, with smooth action, spectacular level of detail and vivid colors.<br /><br />I regret having waited this long to watch this one, if you are in the same boat I was, stop dilly-dallying and watch it now. You'll be glad you did.
B000255LIY|5.0|Well I suppose in choosing a favorite version of The Lion in Winter, it all depends on taste. I happen to choose Patrick Stewart over Peter O' Toole, but both Katharine Hepburn, and Glenn Close were Eleanor to the T. Both women capured that strong willed spirit, that makes Eleanor of Aquitaine my favorite queen, hands down. Both O'Toole, and Stewart deliver a king with a bellow, in the winter if his life. But, Stewart in my opinion takes the crown. He is regal.<br /><br />There is no historical data backing up the Christmas spent in Chinon castle, in the year that Henry II and Eleanor's eldest son passes, to my knowledge. However, Henry II &#34;allowing&#34; Eleanor to leave Salisbury castle, where she has been locked up, after a failed revolt against Henry, makes for an interesting story. All of the elements of the personalities of Henry II, Eleanor, Richard, Geoffery, and John are there. I would have thought Henry's mistress would have been Rosamond, but I woukd need to refresh my memory.<br /><br />As for Phillip of France, and the relationship with Richard the Lionheart goes, I think the jury is still out on that one. But, it added drama to the movie, so I suppose that is why it was included into the storyline.<br /><br />No matter which movie you choose, The Lion in Winter 1, or 2 you will be in for a treat, the costumes are elaborate,  the scenery beautiful, and the acting superb!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like the looks of this app.  It's informative and has options that I like.  With the weather info, I wake up to see how I need to dress for the day.
1608838137|5.0|Season three of Downton Abbey delivers all the joy, hardships, and personal struggles that seasons one and two delivered. The setting is breath taking, the costumes remain lovely, and perfect to the period in which the storyline continues. I suppose for me at this point is concerning Mr. Bates...is he a good man, or does he hide a deep dark secret? Perhaps season four, might lend some more hints which will allow an accurate conclusion.
B00006AW63|1.0|Bought this Dvd not realizing it would NOT play on a US dvd player.  Why would you sell dvds that can not play on US players without being clearly stated in the header not some fine print in the details.????  It costs more to send it back than I paid for it.  Why are you all not watching this?  How much money have these people made from unsuspecting buyers.  Have bought dvds from Amazon before with no problems.  Very dissapointed.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game to play. It even fills in the time when you have nothing to do. Especially when your waiting at the doctors office. I can't wait for another game like this from this designer.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Worst movie I ever wasted money on!  You made me give it one star.  It didn't deserve one at all.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|Its Ezio...need I say more.  Great figurine.  It is a great addition to my collection.  I left him in the package though, so not sure about movement and accessories.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Its worth renting. It was entertaining, and Ryan Renaolds was great to look at. I also like some of the camera angles...
B00FEHXISA|3.0|This was kinda disappointing.  The Iron Man suits and super heated bad guys was a bit of a stetch for me.  The story was decent enough, but it went way beyond the borders of Sci-Fi into the realm of pure fantasy.  It just did to feel or look like it belonged in the Iron Man saga.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I thought that this movie drug on a little bit. They defiantly could have edited this movie to be about 45 minutes shorter.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Really good and scary movie.  The story is a little hard to follow and piece together, but it does come together and is a good watch.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this series. Great books, So easy to lose yourself in the story. I know a lot of people are complaining about the ending but I didn't mind it, When you love a series, there is no way to end it perfect because you don't want to see it end at all!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game its so sick fun and awesome .if your reading this right now trust me its a fun game I'm already playing this non stop maybe you'll like it to try it out see wat you think if you Lii it then keep it if not then o well ur lose but its cool
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!! It's very addicting though! A lot of different boards and different challenges! If you like puzzles and arcade games you will love candy crush!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The question here is who is helping who.  The interplay between the two main characters is fascinating, poignant and enlightening.  The pace of the story keeps you hoping for a happy ending but who would really be happy.  The story also clarifies the indignities of a person trapped in his body and always having to rely upon others for day-to-day bodily issues--from having to be fed, clothed, bathed and &#34;arse&#34; wiping.  In the end, both main characters win.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Item works exactly as it's suppose too. A great way to game at Grandma & Grandpa's, friends or while traveling :)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|AAwesome show. Great writing. We watch two shows a night.  The acting is top notch and story lines really pull you in.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My family loves this movie!  It has become a family tradition to watch the movie during the holidays! This movie gets 5 stars from me! It jus warms your heart!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie is fun.  The 3.5 and 5.5 plus the husband laughed all the way thru.  Good family times.  Actually heart warming as well.
B004KSRPX8|3.0|I feel as though I read a different book to the rest of the reviewers. 'Romancing Mr Bridgerton' started out well enough with Penelope having been in love with Colin for years, but never getting past good friend status, but it never delivered on the early promise. As Colin gradually comes to realise he loves Penelope (in the first third of the book), they kiss and each likes the other but minor problems are strewn in their path - the tension dissipates and I was left...well frankly, bored.<br />There are some nice touches, such as the formidable Lady Danbury, but the whole mystery over Lady Whistledown was OK at first but then became tedious. If this was a school report it would be a case of 'Could do better.'
B003XRELEI|1.0|200 % negative view of this country. There are things to be improved/corrected, but crapping your own nest doesn't do. Vonnegut can write and be funny too, but I didn't finish this book.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|I just received this in the mail after having ordered it yesterday at Amazon's Gold Box price of $77 (tax included) and I am completely satisfied with the set so far. I was pleased to see that the box comes with the 10 original season set boxes that were sold individually in the past. So many complete series nowadays come in cheap envelopes that easily scratch the discs. I can't wait to start watching these as soon as I have time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A happy ending isn't a necessary , don't listen to the hate,a fantastic ending to a great trilogy. Life is a box of chocolates.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Each book keeps getting better....I really thought book #1 was tough to read,but everyone told me to keep reading.  Glad I did, now on to #4
B002UZCJP2|5.0|SciFi plus Bruce Willis, worth watching until 5th Element 2 is thought of, he kicks butt even when he doesn't know why.
B00FAEPX9Y|1.0|I hope she gets some direction in her endeavor....otherwise..she is a one hit wonder. I wish her the best. Keep trying...
B004JHY8A8|4.0|Excellently written, an eye opener into the world of the holecaust victims and the role France played. A very emotive piece of work. Very good read!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Works great with my Britax B Agile stoller system. Very nice to carry cell phone and bottle of water or coffee cup. Much cheaper than the Britax one and works great.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|it,s a ok game and fun. I play it when I,m board.  The only thing is it crashes at times
B004E2XAHK|4.0|Great talent, but not as amazing as their other albums.  If you're a Within Temptation fan, is a definite buy, but if this is your first introduction to them, consider &#34;The Heart of Everything&#34; or &#34;Silent Force&#34; first.
B008ASGP3U|2.0|This was my first book by this author and very likely my last.  The book was extremely slow moving.  Halfway through the book, very little had occurred, and almost no action.  I hoped that perhaps the second half of the book and the ending might redeem the book, but it was not to be.  The ending was inconclusive and gave no explanation as to the motive for the crimes.  The book was a total disappointment.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|When I'm close to clearing the screen, I'll buy 5 moves or other bonus. Many times the app store<br />purchase resets the page so I lose my game progress, negating the reason for this purchase. Too long to regenerate lives. Only have a few minutes to waste time each day!
B0002KVULG|5.0|langella is the ultimate dracula.  sorry chris lee!  great cast, beautiful photography.creepy and sexy at the same time.  watch it.
039916409X|5.0|Great book. Tapping for Wealth is full of valuable teaching on getting through the emotional dysfunctions.<br />I am grateful for these teachings
B000XUBFE2|2.0|Tedious format.  Somehow I couldn't keep empathy for the characters.  I know their deaths were supposed to be for their better tomorrow's but .....
B00BC254I8|5.0|I confess I am only on chapter 2. It was very hard to put this book down after starting it yesterday. I found myself thinking about what I would say in a review. So far, it is a great read.  It is well-written in a style that lets Mike Tyson's own personality and the unique flavor of his experiences tell his story.  This is coming from a 60 year old, conservative, white mother of five, who thought Mike Tyson a bad role model for the same reasons he did. I was the last person who would have wanted to read something by Mike Tyson.  A few years ago after one of his well-publicized scrapes, I saw him do a couple of interviews and realized he was developing insight.  Suddenly, I liked him.  I was rooting for him.  I still am.  I wonder if he even knows how important his story is.<br />I will update this after I finish.<br /><br />Finished it and still give 5 stars.  Got reminded of why I did not like him and then reminded of why I like him now. What Cus taught about becoming a champ now is being applied to the next phase of Mike's life. I believe he can do it.  This is absolutely a story of one man's very tough journey.<br /><br />A great read. Now wondering who will play the young Mike Tyson in the movie. There is so much to tell, maybe it should be a series (on cable, for the language and subject matter ).
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This save from typing in browser google.com always good fast app happy with it never crashed good sturdy app try it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Only reason for 4 stars is they need more levels, otherwise it would be a 5. Just a heads up for mobi!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest  it is so much fun searching for recipes handy tips how to's so many things and create folders to store and share your findings great great great !!
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|No storyline. No character development, no arc. It's all about the monsters, which you don't see much - nor have any understanding re: a motivation, except for 2 lines near the end of the film. As a fan of del Toro's other work, very disappointed.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This does what it says and the notes are easy to print out no completed things to do just click to print or edit a note.. I like the fonts very nice selection great job Thanks Evernote Group
B002VH7P4O|3.0|Despite handling it with care, the stem can easily come off. It then has to be reattached with glue before you can pull the USB out of the apple.Certainly, not a strong enough attachment. The collection is great once you've made the repair.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Amazon Brings it home again great app  Thanks Amazon keep up the great work Does what I want and searching is a breeze
1416595236|5.0|Flynn's books move at lightspeed and are great reads!! I've read all of his books in the Rapp series and look forward to the next!!
0802473156|5.0|I bought this for a friend after I read it years ago.  I recomment it to anyone who is having communication issues with a friend, family member or coworker.  I wish I had read this back when my parents were alive.  It would have explained a lot.
B00005T7I1|5.0|This movie will always be a favorite.  It is campy and fun.  The colors are magnificent.  The cast is terrific.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Not only  is this good for managing your storage, but it  is so big  to have a free and quick method of clearing your cache. If you ever have  a program crash or glitch, just just this really quick, and it usually solves most issues for me!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I'm usually a little bit dissatisfied with mysteries, but I loved this one. It has good characterization and great, evocative writing about Wyoming.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Another excellent piece of literature by Mark Twain. It is cleaverly written, peppered with perceptive quotable observations and evokes nostalgia in the mature reader.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Best Iron Man yet. Interesting storyline and great action scenes. The comedy was by far what made it. Excellent timing and in all the right places.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I like the director. The actors are good. It is more than I expected from the stripper backdrop, but less than I expect of a movie that I want to see more than once.
1476727651|5.0|I will admit I recently got into Stephen King and less than a month ago I read \\"The Shining\\". I've also read \\"Carrie\\" (before the movie came out), \\"The Green Mile\\" and now \\"Doctor Sleep\\". Even though I haven't read a lot of King's work I will admit that this is my favorite thus far by him. I liked it better than \\"The Shining\\" even though that was good as well. Movie sucked. Not getting into that rant.<br />I'm sure from other reviews you know that \\"Doctor Sleep\\" follows a now adult Danny Torrance and his life after that fateful winter at the Overlook Hotel. He meets with another girl with \\"the shining\\" named Abra and together must stop a vampire like tribe known as True Knot from killing children with the shining.<br />I found myself laughing out loud and also glued to the book like no tomorrow. I'm going to purchase it come the holidays or at least have it on my Christmas/birthday list. It really was an incredible read!
B009WHDE3C|4.0|Great cast and good screenplay. Uplifting and life affirming adventure with some solid performances by the cast. I recommend it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  Wonderful book with a wonderful message.  I read it aloud to my 6,8, and 10 year old children.  They loved it as much as I did.
B00196YNWU|5.0|One of my favorite all-time films. Something people of all ages can enjoy. Not many movies like that are made these days.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|A bit predictable but I enjoyed the book. I've been lucky to know several people on the Autism Spectrum so I could relate to the friendships in the book.
B0067TGSOK|3.0|I guess I liked this book. There's something in it that sort of smacks of exclusive-ism, like &#34;leave the 9-5 jobs to all the other suckers.&#34; Lots of people have to work normal jobs that they don't enjoy, for a variety of reasons. I don't believe the answer is to do as little work as possible, and to constantly &#34;love&#34; what you do. I think it's a great ideal, but there are a lot of people out there who could use encouragement in other ways
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row reminded me of earlier Grisham books that I loved. The lawyer, Jake, in the book &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; as his life has progressed a few years after the trial, has a new case.
B004FWPK7M|1.0|The movie was good but the ending was completely retarded what the hell?!? I would love to know why in the world did they even give it such a crappy ending? Was it a set up for a sequel? This movie would have been good if the ending did not destroy the whole freaking movie!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This story will grab you right from the start and is hard to put down until you reach the end.  If you haven't read any of the Lee Child Reacher books, I recommend you read them in order starting with this one.  Reacher's character is developed a bit more with each novel.
B003XU02QG|3.0|This is an western trying to look like a period piece.Dominic West,playing the rough and rowdy commander,could just as easily be John Wayne in \\"Fort Apache\\".This character follows the myth from \\"Gladiator\\" of the rough and ready Roman General, at this period and even in 180 A.D. the time of \\"Gladiator\\";legion commanders had to be of Senatorial Class.The battle in the Scottish Moors is well staged and exciting;the rest of the film is standard soldiers trying to escape marauding savages fare. Fortunately West and Fassbender, have and will do better work in their careers.If you treat this film as a dressed-up Western,you can enjoy the experience
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Funding game different than other games. no issues with freezing. Makes waiting for those candy crush lives easier!!! Play and happy shooting
B00FX8CLSI|5.0|as in everything he seems to try, he has produced a item that only someone who believes that he is bringing art into the world can produce. thank you for your contribution to my passion.
1250038820|5.0|I was mesmerized by this book. Opened the package, started reading, and did not stop until the last page. A brilliant way of bringing the human element to the forefront. We are not just masses of people. We are individuals that are unique and often quite charming, funny, and incredibly wise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had to read this book after I saw the movie and I was not disappointed. The author kept me wanting to read more, I couldn't even put the book down. Time for book 2 now 👍
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game very much wish that it was longer...but it was fun and worth every second can not wait for more levels
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|This movie is not just about action or some sci-fi thriller. This movie is about consciousness!!! We have the power to control our thoughts. If we are conscious of those thoughts we can design our lives the way we want.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I dont write many reviews, but I must recommend this movie. Its a scifi romcom, and done very well with great actors, plot, and background. I saw it years ago, and laughed til my face hurt when I watched it again. Deniro out does himself, Pfiffer is wicked good, and our &#34;star crossed lovers&#34; are adorable with out being saccharine. the ghosts are a riot! its fairly kid safe too, no sex, minimal non- gory violence. a definite popcorn pleaser that will leave a smile on your face
B007T8BYWE|5.0|This is a great game and it is also a game you no th it not realise but u have to think about it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great acting and writing on all parts!! Such great history there and giving it a twist was a brilliant idea. The show gave me so much interest that I went out and bought a book on King Henry VIII.
B00C50NV2C|4.0|I have a question that nobody can answer for me and its getting really annoying! do these have to be worn with a 3d TV?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good time playing makes you think ahead even if you don't get it after a few times there is always later.
B00F031XPS|3.0|First of all, watching this documentary, you wouldn't know that Jimi had a brother.  Jimi and his brother Leon grew up together.  You might also believe that Jimi's dad supported him in his musical pursuits.  He did not.  Jimi's dad Al considered a career in music to be impractical and did not buy Jimi any guitars as he said he did.  Jimi's aunt bought him a guitar.  Jimi's grandmother (his mother's mother) spent time with him when he was little while his dad was at work.  She was half Cherokee and told him old legends of the Cherokees and this had an influence on his songwriting.  Another influence on his songwriting were the science fiction novels he liked to read.  For example, the phrase \\"Purple Haze\\" came from one of those novels.  He liked Bob Dylan's lyrics and these also influenced him.  Another important issue is that Michael Jeffrey, his business manager, hid away most of the money Jimi earned from his concert performances, money that has never been found.  Let's hear more about his playing style, too, his technique.  Just what is he doing with his guitar?  Instead of having a bunch of talking heads saying \\"He was great!,\\" have them describe why he was great.  They are all simply too vague.  These are a lot of the details that deserve greater attention in a documentary about Jimi Hendrix.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!! I.SPEND SEVERAL HOURS AT A TIME ON IT.  I would recommend this game to others. Good way to spend time!!!!!!!
B008EAVFFW|1.0|As many others have already stated, this novel is deeply flawed.  I'm a huge Murakami fan, but (and rarely was there ever a bigger &#34;but&#34;), this book is vastly over-written--tedious at best, maddening at worst.  Murakami's publisher and/or friends should have had an intervention.  If you have never read Murakami, attempt no landings here.  Read A Wild Sheep Chase instead.  That will leave you in a much better frame of mind than i'm in right now.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This works so great on my kindle  hd . It takes awesome pictures and amazing videos. You must get this app
B00821OX98|5.0|If you love sci-fi then you need to watch this series...if the pilot captures you like it did me then you will find yourself getting involved with the show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush it was about time kindle made this app it fun and i.love  that i can take it anywhere with me
B00CNBS40M|5.0|I love Lego and their inventiveness when it comes to their product and their ability to model any ship (I wish they'd do Star Trek).  A challenging set that my son love.
0316322407|4.0|She is amazing! Very thoughtful and inspiring.. Will make one want to follow her career. It will be fascinatingly spiritual.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Best show on television - consistently great since the first season.  Lots of new characters in Season 4 and even more plot twists..  Great Stuff
B008JFUPK8|5.0|A great new modern take on superman!<br /> This combo pack comes with a dvd movie, a blu-ray movie and a blu-ray speacial features disc.
0345803493|3.0|The book is good but the USED book stunk!!  I had to wash it and try to air it out before I could even try to read it.  It smelled really musty, not a good smell.  I will never buy a used book again!
B002L3RVCY|5.0|If you like Obi-wan or Anakin this series is for you! This Series is set between episode two and three so it shows stuff you've never seen before!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|So glad John Grisham wrote a sequel to A Time To Kill, my favorite book of all John Gresham's books and I've read them all. This book was 2nd best to the first book I just mentioned.  I could hardly put the book down, great story to it, sad, happy, some funny areas and I would recommend this book.  Great ending!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|It is just a really good book. Would give it 10 more stars than Fifty Shades...definitely a book I would recommend...a great read.
B00AO686MY|5.0|Loved this film when it first came out - enjoyed it even more in Blu-ray format.  Totally enjoyed.  Reminds me of a time when movie theaters showed cartoons before every feature film.
B008Y79IUE|2.0|creepy movie. Full nudity. Live sex, not what I expected at all. The story is very interesting, but also very disturbing. Is this reality for some?
B008602KQI|5.0|I had heard good things about the Hunger Games from my parents and had never gotten around to watching it. The movie draws you into this world and really makes you start to care about the characters, the little mocking jay pen is a powerful symbol I think in the movie and I am definitely going to go read the books now!  I give this Movie an A+ and look forward to more
B001O96JC4|4.0|It's a silent movie with all the requisite scenery chewing that the silents required. The images are of relatively poor quality,  rescued bits from old nitrate based film. The old hand cranked camera makes the action jumpy at times.That said, the story and and the imagery are remarkable for their time.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie is very well cast to help you believe the characters would develop into the familiar faces from the original series. I enjoyed watching the original TV series, none of the spin-off shows ever captured my attention like the original. During this movie you learn the background of the characters and it still holds the excitement of exploring new and wonderful worlds never before seen by man.
B001V7SME2|5.0|This is a frightening but heartwarming film about love and the many strange forms it may take. It is, none the less, love. I wish I could understand Swedish to feel it in a purer form. You will want to watch it more than once, hence I bought a copy for myself.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Although sequels are not always as good as the original, this one surprised us. The movie is fantastic and gives a lot of background information on one of the earlier Star Trek movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and have already watched it a couple of times. Highly recommend it to Star Trek fans.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This story is ponderously slow. Step by step it creeps along. You'll be tempted to give up on it about a third of the way through. Don't. The last 20% is worth the effort. And if it dawns on you what's really going on, you're have a whole lot more imagination than I do.
B00EODUWQ6|5.0|I really enjoyed the concept and seemed a believable future Not usually my kind of book so I was pleasantly surprised
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|I think many of the reviews here are overly harsh. The app works fine, does what it claims, and the ability to review and edit your past calculations is a very useful feature. Yes, other calculator apps (like \\"Office Calculator\\" and \\"Calculator Plus\\") also have history features, but that's not a good reason to downgrade this app. The other apps mostly display the history on a separate screen, which makes it slower to access (though perhaps easier to read) than on this app. Only you can decide if you like the style of this app better than the others, so why not give it a try? They have a free version if you don't want to spend the $2.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great, the best, great present for the holidays.  I watched the series twice.  It provides a different view of the future and technology.
0765325950|5.0|Great series. This was the last one in the series I've been reading for about 14 or 15 years. So happy they tapped Sanderson to finish the series after Robert Jordan died. He stayed true to Jordan's vision and the transition has been seamless. Highly enjoyable read for those true book lovers of fantasy fiction like myself. Though, frankly, I'm glad to finally have this series over. I thought I was going to die before they were finished!
B009JZSC9S|4.0|really interesting and unpredictable and fairly accurate as to how a big law firm is run.  The cases would never get to trial as fast as they show on television.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|It was okay movie.  It was well acted and directed, but kind of slow and basically too long for what it was.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Amazing, very easy to browse. Was available to rent very soon after the movies was released. Was not available on Youtube or on Netflix. So its the best possible option for those who missed the movie on theater.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|I had heard that the antagonist in this film was \\"beyond evil\\" and \\"unbelievably bad\\". I found him to be trite, predictable and at the end of the day, easily defeated. The action sequences were good, the story, as many have mentioned, was humdrum and telegraphed the entire way. Too long a movie for a story this basic. Towards the end when it became \\"Home Alone\\" domestic defense preparation, I nearly laughed. I'll take a pass on this one. Not recommended viewing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It seems to work very well even with my slow connection look out RoKu new kid on the block great deal 35.00 set up was easy remember you Chromecast has to have the same setting as your wifi.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The quality when casting a tab from Chrome is not as good as I had hoped. Working from an app like YouTube works well and i wish there was more support for the unit from others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like the matching concept, like Bejeweled. Like that each level is different.  Like that it's challenging.  All my friends are playing it.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite show. Loved it!! There is no better show on in my humble opinion! Must see TV for sure.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief was so very creatively written, I was immediately absorbed and I could not put this book down!
B003O86FMW|5.0|So detailed can't wait to read the next one. I have loved these series so much. Thank you Suzanne Collins.
1401938906|4.0|have skimmed this book. haven't had a chance to READ it.... so I may change this comment to even better. But this looks amazing based on the TOC . I think it will be amazing!
B000OBYLVO|3.0|Good movie--escapism!  Funny but not GREAT.  Loved the British scenery.  Warm, fuzzy story line.<br />It's what I would call a &#34;girlie&#34; flick.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm loving this game so much. It's like being in the movie. The graphics are great and so is game play. I love the scrat game. Only issue I have is it costs 10 million coins at a certain level to expand. I'm busy completing my families right now. It's fun and you should try it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|When I first got this, it was really fun. But...honestly It got KINDA boring later on. I found out how many levels it had,  and I'm like WOW!! I think I read 3,000 somethan... So you should try it and see if you like it. Its free enyway!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I am absolutely into this game so much! It's cool and the graphics are great. I love rescuing the sick animals and putting them in my park.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive I see striped candy in my sleep!!!  I just wish you could accumulate more than 5 lives!  Love it!!
1476727651|5.0|This was an awesome purchase!  The book is in great condition and I'm very much enjoying reading it.  Price was great, too.  I would definitely make other purchases from Amazon again in the future for books like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is different from any others&#34;switch&#34; game in that most levels are not timed, each level is different and each has it's own goal.  It main negative is that it is very addicting and thankfully you are given only five lives at a time and only earn another back every 30 minutes or I would not get anything else done!  Fun game.
0739341243|5.0|An &#34;Ah Ha&#34; book explaining introverts, why they are the way we are and why that is OK.  Introverts are highly beneficial to society.  Introverts can adapt to an extroverted society, but not change who they are. Both introverts and extroverts have their societal roles.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Not a bad movie. It was neat to look at and had it's moments (so, in addition to green chicks, this CPT Kirk likes girls with  tails?).<br />But, I've seen \\"Wrath of Kahn\\", and as whacky as the \\"Genesis\\" thing was, it was more enjoyable, with having Ricardo Montalbán in it and all (dude was a class act). But if all these guys are gonna do is re-hash the '66-69 episodes to conform to what they may have wanted them to be, well, I may have to pass on any others. (Bring back \\"Enterprise\\" - oops - did I write that out loud?)<br />Oh yeah, and \\"Wrath\\" also had Kirstie Alley (at her absolute cutest), in it as well.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I was looking for a game where I did not have to be hooked up to the Internet<br /> all the time. This was it. You just have to update with wireless. Connection once in awhile. But the other reviewers say it best.<br /><br />This game is a dream come true.
B001EPYQO6|5.0|WOW! Brad Pitt in high def, Blu-ray, and extra scenes. What else could a girl ask for?!  This is really a &#34;must have&#34; for history and Brad Pitt lovers.
B000095K7A|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing, I've listened to it over and over since I've received it!  As far as the actual record goes it arrived in perfect condition and has not disappointed me one bit.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|My all time favorite movie. This Blu-ray edition of &#34;HELP!&#34; looks better than ever. The sound is awesome, it sounds like the Beatles are in the same room with you. This is a real &#34;must have&#34; for all Beatle Lovers.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had been hearing how wonderful this book was, but I didn't realize how wonderful until I began reading it.  If I could have shut out the rest of the world and read it in one sitting, I would have.  ORPHAN TRAIN shifts from a story set in 1920-1930's to one set in 2011.  We are first introduced to Molly who is entrenched in the foster care system.  She has been shuffled from one place to another after her father was killed in a car accident and her mother prefers her drug life over being a mom. She is currently living with a couple who appear to only be in it for the monthly income of having a foster child.  When Molly decides to take a book from the local library that she is sure they won't miss and gets caught, she decides to serve her punishment via community service.  During her time, she will be helping a 90-year-old woman clean out her attic.<br /><br />Vivian is the only surviving member of her family left.  Her attic is full of items and her housekeeper feels it is time she gets rid of some things...with the help of Molly.  What ends up happening is through the boxes and boxes of items, we learn Vivian's story of a child orphaned after her family immigrated to New York City from Ireland.  After a devastating fire, Vivian ends up on the orphan train, headed to the Midwest in hopes of finding a family.<br /><br />I have read several books where the storyline travels back and forth from the present to the past and this book did it right.  The author gives you just enough information and weaves the current story into the story from the past, traveling through each story with ease and keeping the reader intrigued.  Each chapter is well-labeled with time and place so you can get your mind set before you start in on the chapter.<br /><br />The horrors of the life of a orphan, both present and past, will give you great sympathy for those who have been in that situation.  In this story we also go through The Depression as well as WWII with the characters and can feel the agony of those times in the words of the novel.<br /><br />I chose ORPHAN TRAIN for our book club this month.  All of us loved it and we had lots of rich discussion about the characters and their actions.  There were discussion questions included in the book as well as historical facts and photos about the real orphan trains that traveled to the Midwest.<br /><br />The author has based this novel on facts.  She happened upon the history of the orphan train and found a way to tell their stories.  Thankfully there are still survivors left to interview and have their stories be told.  It is a part of our history that shouldn't be forgotten.  I highly recommend you place ORPHAN TRAIN at the top of your reading list.l the agony of those times in the words of the novel.<br /><br />I chose ORPHAN TRAIN for our book club this month.

B002JI94J4|5.0|WOW! Those were the days! Beatlemania had just started and the Beatles were the hit of the land. This movie takes you back to the beginning and 50 years later, I still enjoy this movie. A real &#34;must have&#34; for all Beatle fans.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Incredibly sad at times, but the story is mesmerizing.  I loved this book in spite of it's heartbreaking cruelty and callousness by fellow humans.  You will fall in love, cry, be outraged and also see that small kindnesses can make so much difference in a person's life.  The story rings all too true, sadly.  This was a great read and I highly recommend it.
B00005221M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie at the theatre; but, this home version with the extra scenes was even better than the original. And Daniel Day Lewis was such a STUD!!
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini at his best.  I love all his books!  This story meanders through several lives and compels one to think about life and what it all means.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Frankenweenie was a fun and silly movie.  My husband introduced it to me and I had to have it for my collection.  Shipped very quickly.
1451648545|5.0|Isaacson's biography made me feel like I knew Steve Jobs.  Loved him for his passion, hated him for his selfishness and 'does not apply to me' attitude.  Very insightful book about a very complex man.  Highly recommended!
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS is great and the 10th Season is no different!!  Always great quality picture.  Can't wait for the 11th season to come out on DVD
B008XBCJ34|4.0|It's a great movie.  The only thing I didn't like was the the 3D effects didn't seem as good as the theater.  I don't know much about 3D movie watching so I'm not sure if that's the way all 3D movies are.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great story, super special effects. What a movie should be! Mr. Washington never fails doing a great job of acting
B000062XFG|5.0|Always been a fan of Star Trek.  It was easy to order and it was delivered sooner than forecasted....  The special effects are out dated, but the story lines are enjoyable...
B007R11DKQ|4.0|It was a fun , uplifting, creative, feel good movie....good for a family to watch also. The ghosts and witches were hillarious...
B00AFEX83C|5.0|One of my faves! a great family movie. Entertaining and funny! Love the characters especially Boo, she's hilarious! Could watch over and over.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|super addictive! I am so happy to have this on my kindle now. no more having to bring multiple devices everywhere so i can play :)
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is such a great movie, it does start slow, but gets so much better! The characters are great and it's funny and sweet!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Love the series and have read all five books. It is a good read. Cannot wait for the sixth one.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The show is the best on TV.  I own seasons 1 through 3 already, and I'm sure I'll buy season 4.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|Excellent video release of an excellent movie! Robert Downey Jr. shines with an excellent cast and visual effects work in one of the best sci-fi movies made in recent years.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|It is nice to see an old movie that has a good plot without all the violence, blood and gore. And of course an icon actor and director. I have always wanted to see that movie but never did. Glad we saw it.
B00FEN1C50|3.0|Not a big review.  You know what it is and whether you'll like it.  It's a monster movie, giant robots, and eye candy. A modern day Godzilla movie with a SLIGHTLY better plot than I expected.
0743270754|5.0|Awesome book. Ole honest Abe. We'll sort of, he was a politician wasn't he? But it was a part of American history.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We were hooked after only a couple of episodes.  This series is wholesome and captivating.  The story of these people's lives keep us spellbound without resorting to violence or sex.  Truly a delight!  Young Laura, an apprentice at the Post Office, learns about life and is guided by Dorcas, the Post Mistress, who knows all the secrets of the community.  Downton Abbey fans should watch this series;  Lark Rise to Candleford does for the common folk, what  Downton Abbey does for the aristocracy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I generally have no interest in typical zombie thrillers, but all three seasons have been fantastic! Great storyline and excellent acting.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't guess the secret.  I loved that!  I kept reading to find out what was coming next. My favorite part was the epilogue.  I'm always so sad when I finish a book, wondering what happened after... I loved the finish on this one!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a fun game that i found easy to play and I can share it with grownups and kids.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|They have great sounds, I choose 4 to play all at once they go so well together. And they are free, it's a dream come true. Thank you.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It's a book I couldn't put down!  Make sure you read the first book Maze Runner.  Surprising events and an outcome that made me want to read the next book instantly.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First two books were awesome.  Certain parts in this book feel forced, unnatural for Katniss' character, especially her treatment of Peeta.  I thought the ending was well done, however.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Real music making at it's finest! Great Follow up to the first Black Radio  Album. Robert Glasper<br />is what the music industry needs right now
B008NEMPTO|1.0|The blueray was not 3D as listed. the supplier promised to replace with the correct item. have not heard from him since. I feel as though I have been ripped off,
0307743721|5.0|Alice Munro is my favorite author.  The stories in Dear Life didn't disappoint.  I especially enjoyed the autobiographical sketches at the end.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|brilliant game, all the fun of the pc edition - but in tablet form. fun game for little uns and big uns
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|This movie ROCKS!  It's fresh & original & exciting. I really enjoyed this at the movies, so I pre-ordered this. Seller shipped on time
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Interesting to the end.  I had no basis for comparison so it was all new and it kept me reading.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|what can i say it was fun even playing by yourself against the CPU. I played it a few times before giving it a rest but i must say i like it
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|Because this video made me insane.<br /><br />I'm going to join the naysayers after this blu ray.  I tried to be supportive of their new choice of musician but Portnoy is greatly missed.  That drum machine... I mean robot... I mean Mike Mangini is nothing more than a drummer reproducing sounds.  Portnoy would accent something different during every show.  If I wanted to hear the record, i would listen to it.  It's great they can replicate complex rhythms and flurry of notes but the soul is missing.  It's certainly amazing they can jerk off on there instruments, that's why I first fell in love with them, so no need to get into that.<br /><br />Next, The mix.  What happened?  Sure, I'm a guitarist but that's not all I listen to DT for.  It's the collective of musicians that makes the band.  Where is John Myung?!  No really, you won't be able to hear him, or even see him since he only has about 5 minutes of screen time in 3 hours.  I'm just glad other reviewers have made the same comment.<br /><br />Lastly, the actual film it self.  Let's just say if I were a squirrel the editing would have been amazing, but since i have an attention span it's too fast and scattered.  This is Dream Theater, not Green Day where it needs to be flashy or you'd be bored to death.  And because it is DT most fans would like to watch each musician a bit closer and for longer, especially during their respective solos or parts.  This concert is another example of Portnoy's great talent.  He was excellent in the editing process as he painstaking made sure every cut coincided with a musical theme going on.<br /><br />For the points that are decent.  The band, tight as ever.  The JP12, yum.  The songs from there back catalogue.  With great performances of \\"Spirit Carries On\\" and \\"War Inside My Head/Test That Stumped\\" as they loosened up a bit to play those.<br /><br />Definitely watch it if a fan or new comer.  It's a good reminder of why music is so fun.<br /><br />Thanks for reading
0399157565|5.0|I love the book. I love how quickly it came.  I love the great condition it was in for a &#34;used&#34; book!! Awesome all the way around!
B003W77SA8|5.0|Purchased this on cassette when it first came out… now almost 30 years later I have it again… and it does not disappoint. The music is timeless. Hasn't dated at all.
B000LB7G00|4.0|The spaceball installs easy and works well. The only issue I have with it is that it is easy for the base to rotate without you knowing it and then your either spinning or panning in directions that you didn't intend.  Pretty much expected that though.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|This item works well...even with my cars Kenwood radio!  I recommend this inexpensive option for anyone looking for this type of adapter.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|These days with all the cheesy and unwarranted remakes. You just can't go wrong with the original classics! Exorcist Rules!
1439181780|5.0|I love this book!  Although I am very familiar with other books by this author, I still found The Power to be a wonderful addition to my understanding of the Law of Attraction.  This book is written in a clear and easy to understand manner and I often find myself just picking it up to re-read a chapter or two.  This book is a gem in helping us to remember what we already intuitively know to be true.
0894803123|3.0|Looks impressive. If you have time to fool around hunting for all of the items needed. Takes to long to make ice cream.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I'm such a fan of John Grisham. And this was another great story  I could hardly put it down! Highly recommend for any fan of courtroom drama!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive game! I like that you can still move on by playing the quests, if you can not purchase to move on. It is a challenging game.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie makes you think about spirituality regardless of your religious views.  I for one am not a faithful person or anything, but this movie had me thinking about life and death and the idea of spirits and a soul.  Its also just a beautiful movie to watch, if you aren't the kind of person that analyzed movies.  Its full of suspense and pleasant imagery.  Fully recommend watching this movie in blu ray as well.  Ultra crisp!
B00FPH6M82|1.0|It would be a great movie, if jaden smith wasn't in it. He's just a horrible actor. So much that it ruins the movie.
0679809015|5.0|We got this book for our 2 year old nephew. He loves the pictures and I like the sturdiness of the books!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Very good, suspenseful book.  Out of reality thinking.  An adventure from one end of the earth to the other.  Great entertainment.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It is extreamly limited, performance was not bad, it needs to have capibilities expanded to become useful.  Google Chrome is much better than this and I am suprised they released this item way to early.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Awesome!This movie is CLEAN, family-friendly, funny, suspenseful, and exciting, in all the right mixes. The movie is well made - We were hooked, it was a great movie!
0316074314|3.0|Although the novel is brilliant in it's writing and plot--I didn't really care about the story or its characters; the plot concerning who owned the gold was so convoluted I could have cared less and as for the characters--didn't care for any one of them.  But it's still a major achievement and the prose is marvelous. But the novel did not capture me--I finished it only out of respect for her obvious talent. I prefer THE TRAVELS OF JAMIE MCPHEETERS--a novel about the American goldrush.
B00271SFB6|5.0|These movies are usually pretty good. Just like most of James Bond movies, it was very action packed and entertaining!
0345803485|5.0|Best series of books for the imagination and what twists it contained.  Really enjoyed sharing it with my spouse.  Touched me emotionally as I connected with the characters.
B00DJ3ITKS|5.0|Jeff Bezos changed the way to make money, This book show us who is Bezos and how he built this organization.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book. Can't wait for the movie. The writer has a great imagination and the creation of the characters is so real.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Well written and compelling, The Grain Brain is essential reading for anyone who wants the current science on nutritional choices.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Very scary movie! Knowing that it was based on a true story made me even more scared. Lots of scenes that make you jump!
B00EUS6FR0|5.0|Amazing music with an international flair.... fun and engaging.. Pink Martini delivers music that will make you smile. Totally unique.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Better than the movie. Dark but enjoyable. Even humerus at times! I strongly suggest!<br />Give this one a read. You won't regret it!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This album might be the best album they have made to date.  That is really saying something because all their albums are filled with talent.  This album sounds like it would have come out after To Hell With the Devil more so than IGWT which took a more glam/pop metal feel.  So if you like the oldschool metal of that time, this album is for you.  This does not sound like Murder by Pride or Reborn albums.  Those seem to sound more like Michael's solo albums.  Here is a quick look at the songs.<br /><br />No More Hell to Pay and Revelation songs are straight from the THWTD sound<br />Saved by Love sounds like something from Against the Law era<br />Jesus is Just Alright is a great bluesy rock/metal cover as only Stryper could pull off<br />The One sounds like a great ballad off IGWT album kind of in the vein of Lonely<br />Water to Wine, Symphathy, and Renewed follow in the vein of their early work from SUC or THWTD<br />Marching into Battle sounds like something from Roxx Regine demos<br /><br />Hopefully this helps.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|All the visuals from previous films by Wong Kar Wai are here, this is his most conventional film since &#34;As Tears go By&#34; and his first &#34;Wu Xia&#34; since &#34;Ashes of Time&#34; but it lacks the weirdness of all those movies, anyway this is something special and over the top.<br />PD This DVD don't have any extras, shameful!
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|Loved the story line, kept you engrossed all the way to the end. It was hard to put this book down, the movie was not the same the book was much better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It challeneing, it fun and makes you use your brain cells. I would highly recommend it to my friends and family.
B002RI9ZPY|3.0|Good read, sad story but has some very funny moments, i enjoyed this book as it really shines on what did happen in there day.
B000002JEV|5.0|got for my husband and he says it is excellent. the first live performance of stairway is on it.  that is more than enough to make this a great gift for any classic rock or zeplin fan
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|It was extremely well done and had a story to tell, that needs to be told.  Everyone should see this video and see the effects of alcohol when it rules your life.
