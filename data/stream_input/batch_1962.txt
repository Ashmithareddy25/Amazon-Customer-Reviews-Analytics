B007HJ91HU|5.0|I was in High School in NH when the orignal movie came out.  I remember sitting between 2 of my friends and letting the movie take me to this magical world where music and dance could unite a community.  When we left the theater, my car was covered with snow, and I remember taking the snow brush out of my trunk and doing the \\"footloose\\" dance to my cassette of Quiet Riot (in the movie) while my friends cheered me on.  One of the best memories I have of being a teenager.<br /><br />My teen years are, well, over 20 years behind me, so this movie means a lot to me.  When I heard they were remaking it, I was not happy.  I began watching this movie with a well deserved hatred.  How dare they mess with my memories??!!  Outside of the bus racing scene, this is an absolutely A++++ revision of the original.  The current version is respectful of the movie it is based on without being a lame carbon copy.  The leads are under appreciated actors and incredible dancers.  I defy anyone of my age (46) to watch the new Ren teach his best friend to dance and not remember Kevin Bacon teaching Chris Penn to dance.<br /><br />This movie has the heart and soul of the original, while giving it a time-sensitive make over.  No Gen Y or Z kid will watch an 80's movie, but they will watch this.  Finally, a movie we can all enjoy!  You can fly if you'd only cut loose!
B007SGM084|5.0|Very rarely I find a book I cannot put down. My sister told me yo read it so I did. It took me only 4 days to get through the whole series!!! It reminds me of the feeling between me and my husband when we first met!!
B004P2HMNM|5.0|I bought this set for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and she has been entertained for days.  I have to pull her away from it.
B005HSL626|5.0|It gets five stars since its just like the one I play with my kids on Kinect. Nice little touchscreen game I can enjoy while waiting on the train.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It was one of my favorite books, it moved along quickly, the plot changed often, I thought I knew how it would end but I never quessed correctly.  I came to the end and was so sorry to have to say good by to all the people I came to care about.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game at first I thought it was realy stupid but then I started playing it more and it started to get dealt fun
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I usually enjoy John Grisham's work but this was too much I kept going back to see if there was something I had missed. A waste of time.
B004132HZS|3.0|please correct me if I'm wrong but here in the states a season of a television show is usually 10-12 episodes<br />season 1 of Sherlock is 3 episodes and season 2 is also 3 episodes, who in their right mind would box this up<br />and put it out to the public as a season !!!???? wtf??? if I new that I never would of bought it, the show is great, amazing<br />actors both of them, but you cant legitimately  call this a season, the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is solely based on<br />the content and quality of acting by these brilliant actors and their writing team, but you cant call 3 episodes a season, maybe in the U.K. you can but not in America
B0001CNRSE|5.0|This was part of a birthday gift for my wife.  The DVD played flawlessly, and although not my style, my wife was excited to receive  this movie in great condition!
B005LAIGJQ|5.0|Lots of laughs. Actually I saw it first on Video-On-Demand in Macau Wynn's Hotel Resort. Then I decide to keep a copy of it.
B002ZG997M|5.0|This is one of his finest performances! If you are a fan of Denzel Washington this is a must see movie!

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app!! I have it on every night when I go to bed. there are many sounds to chose from.
B007UXSKMU|5.0|This was action from start to finish and I believe the best MI movie to date.  Tom Cruise shows his best acting skills in this one.  A real nail-biter.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Well I guess it's okay it is just a dictionary. It helps allot on homework. I think that all dictionaries are the same.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Nashville never disappoints, and this album is no exception.  All the great music from the show compiled into an album.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Honestly I read hundreds of books, I'm a writer at heart and a good story is like my TV. For some this book may be immature and not worthwhile but it does not hurt to try. I was surprised when I could not put the book down, normally I'm a fantasy fiction person but I wanted to try a new adventure. Enders Game was impossible for me to put down, I sat reading at four pm and finished the book at around three am. Which by the way made me super tired that day. It's worth diving into, but the real choice of is it good or not is up to you.<br /><br />If its hard to understand, Orson Scott wrote Enders game like a play in a way. Try reading it out loud.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is the best.  It has everything at your fingertips and easy to use.  Highly recommended.  Would buy again. I love G-mail also.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I'm a big fan of Transformers going back to the 1980s cartoons.  This movie, like all the other recent ones, do a major disservice to the franchise.  But at least it looks good while doing it.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|The LEGO Shuttle Expedition 10231 was just what my grandson wanted. It was perfect and a joy to see his face light up at Christmas time.
B008WK30XO|5.0|has a few repeated, remixed tracks on this.... but other wise an epic album that goes with this epic movie
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Amazon Instant Video iOS app crashes about once every two hours of play time. Mildly annoying. I'm sure it will be addressed at some point.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The girl with the dragon tatoo is is a great mystery but it tends to get a little confusing but worth the read
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really enjoy this app. Being able to check in and see what all my friends are up to is great.
1449415881|5.0|This item came intact and seems to be in good quality.  Was packaged well and not damaged at all.  Would order again
B003NF0G12|5.0|This movie has stayed with me since I first viewed it over 10 years ago.  Rob Brown was an unknown actor when he auditioned for this movie, and his performance is outstanding.  What I liked most about the movie, however, is the plot.  The main character's knowledge of classic novels and his ability to quote from them is something that I would love for my own children to be able to achieve.  The music, specifically \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\\" performed by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, really adds to the sentiment of the characters Jamal Wallace and William Forrester.  I highly recommend this movie for almost anyone.  If you share a love of classic novels and/or quotations this movie will really be a treat for you.  I would love to see an Blu-ray release for this movie, I'm surprised that there isn't one already.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game, it is additive. I think it help keep your mind alert and is really a challanging.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|Perfect to use in a French class and watch with friends. It's a really nice story and really well play
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is a great sounding dual purpose SACD/CD for those who have SACD capability.  One of the best CDs of all time.
1610390938|5.0|In this book two upstart economists show how to break the debilitating stranglehold of ideology on academic economics:  A laser focus on empirical understanding (how economies of the poor actually work), using scientific methods (in depth interviews, randomized controlled trials) long common in related disciplines.  What's missing is global context.<br /><br />For example, there is no way more than a tiny fraction of all the world's tiny businesses run by the world's poor could ever rise to the level of supporting middle class incomes. Each such successful business must be run by relatively few people commanding a relatively large amount of global resources, especially cheap energy and all the products and services and distribution systems enabled by cheap energy. Energy from the most useful source, oil, is maxing out right now, collapsing global economic growth, with coal and gas not far behind, while realists expect renewables to replace only a fraction of the coming decline in fossil fuels.<br /><br />So it doesn't matter how clever we are at helping those millions of tiny businesses, few will succeed because neither the markets nor the supplies will be there. To overcome the current limits-to-growth without major economic contraction, we'd need very rapid development (over 2 to 3 decades) of the technology and infrastructure for massive amounts of cheap energy from a new source, such as nuclear fusion. Despite much hype of new technologies by a host of entrepreneurs, nothing like this is in sight, leaving incremental improvements to mitigate, but not stem the long fossil fuel descent ahead.<br /><br />The good news:  Somewhat better incomes for the poor are possible by not only reducing corruption, but also monopolies, tax evasion, and all the other ways that channel most of the profits to a few owners and executives.  Too bad that Banerjee and Duflo only address corruption, and even that in only a fragmentary way. The bad news:  Even the world's most productive economies, such as North America, Europe, and China are failing on this score, with radical increases in economic inequality over the last two generations.<br /><br />Reality check:  Even though global population growth is now slowing, if the long term goal is at least a very modest middle class life style for everyone on the planet, it is likely that global population will have to shrink to something like the 1 to 2 billion people who are currently somewhat middle class. Of course a utopian could cite the fact that the global population could be cut in half over 40 years if women on the average were to have only one child, with that child born in her mid thirties. Now a dystopian ... well, you fill in the blank.<br /><br />So Banerjee and Duflo are to be commended for actually investigating how the world's poor deal with hunger, health, family size, education, work, risk, etc. Yet their work needs a sequel that puts it in a limits-to-growth global context.  Part of the problem undoubtedly stems from the focus of mainstream economics on an absurdly narrow micro-economic view of the world, with a superficial and distorted view of macro-economics.  Only a few economists, like Charles Hall, understand that cheap energy (and associated technology) has always been the driver of economic growth, going back to our hunter-gather days, where energy came to us mostly from eating scattered plants and animals.<br /><br />Today the poor are poor because very little of that cheap energy is serving them, most of it goes into serving the rich because they control it in one way or another. Fundamentally this is an issue of political economy. The bad news is that changing a political economy from within often involves prolonged struggle, including violence. The good news is the work of Banerjee and Duflo suggests that well researched interventions from respected forces on the outside can make significant improvements by a series of carefully chosen low cost tweaks to the system. This is of course exactly what one expects from the complexity of real world economies as opposed to the simplistic and misleading models promoted by most economists.s is of course exactly what one expects from the complexity of real world economies as opposed to the simplistic and misleading models promoted by most economists.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent, Grisham is the master. I killed me to wait until my family gave me my new kindle to order this book!
0765325950|5.0|More than I expected, just as I hoped. The ending of this series managed to keep the tension while at the same time fulfilling everything built up over the last 13 books.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a outstanding read, a great mix of hard scifi technical details and down to earth story telling.  Can't wait to see what else the author may write!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read. I couldn't put it down. Loved the story line. Definitely would recommend it to my friends. Disappointed the third book not out until May.
0385493800|5.0|I reordered this book by accident, then sat down and read it again. Awesome. I weent back to the jungle!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is challenging and lots of fun. Occasionally it stumps me and a few of the games I still haven't managed.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I thought it was just ok. Would not watch it again.<br />My 12 year old daughter thought it was funny though. More of a teen movie.
B009O07NDY|2.0|The booklet is nice and elegant with nice pictures and drawings.  Could have been better though.<br />The music was nice but It lacks an epic feel. I loved all three of the Lord of the Rings soundtracks.  They were Epic!  This soundtrack lacks something, it's just ok.  I do love the Misty Mountain and Lonely Mountain songs though.  THESE are Epic!<br /><br />I really hope that the next two aren't as disappointing.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This book was a good read, just like all of Preston and Child literature.  However,  I didn't think this one was as good as the previous two in the series.  There were no boring moments in the book as the pace was very fast.  I would recommend it.
B003NX75B8|5.0|It's not fair anymore John! And this time you dragged another author in on it too. It happened in Looking for Alaska, you left us hanging. Come on man....<br />Also, I assume that Levithan wrote the no capital Will Grayson and you wrote the other. But can someone confirm that?
B005LAJ17M|5.0|can't wait for season 2. This show is electrifying , full of suspense and is just a good example of good acting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Having read all three books a couple of years ago, I had to take in the movie. When Hungary Games was released o DVD I received it for Christmas 2012 After watching the movie a second time I had to take in the book again. I really liked this book both times. Lots of action, a bit of romance and still the hate for the Capital. Now I have to wait until next Nov for the second movie release...<br /><br />One more thing, I have never watched a movie that followed the book as close as Hungary Games did.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a wonderful bargain for a gift for my husband.  He is a kid at heart who has never grown up.  He loves the set that it came in.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Now...I'm only 12 and I loved the series to the very end of this book, now let me tell u something<br />This book may seem boring to people who don't fully get wrapped in the story like I do, I remember falling into a trancelike state until someone had to shake me to get me into reality unlike the book one and two, this one doesn't house to much action of the hunger games, yet it's more about the emotional toll of katniss ever since the games, and I do love the ending if I do say so myself!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book! Reading this was like being on a roller coaster of emotions. It has been a long time since I have laughed or cried out loud while reading. I wonder if men like Holder really exist!
0060594896|5.0|This is a book full of wise information, one of those books that you continue to go back to and  re- read.
B001DRF84W|2.0|This Hulk was inaccurate to the comics. It had few scenes of great comic enjoyment. It's not that great, and I knew when I bought it. I only wanted to have it to my superhero collection. And Lee isn't a bad director. In fact, there are some moments when he does a superb job, and other times I feel like he was just not fit to take the lead in a movie like this.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is a great book for children 7-15 this book entertained me as well as my siblings and family this book is quite the book
B009NOVCTM|5.0|As always another Rolling Stone hit. The music as always is great just like their first. Looking forward to the listening to it over and over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, can't wait to read to read next book. I can't wait to watch the movies. Great read! Peace
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|With a fifth installment to the Alien series, I was really excited. It was so much different, but not terrible. It was good, and the 3D was okay in the theaters, but way better on a personal television. The price was just right, and I think it is a great purchase.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love this story. Read it in two days. Alex the handsome widower what's not to love. Erin aka Katie a distressed soul ready for a change in her life made it really easy to continue reading page after page.
B009186JYI|5.0|Brought this for my husband who is a Hugh Rolling Stone fan and he just loved it. It really tells the story of the Rolling Stones. I know they did want this to be published but, glad it was.We really enjoyed it a lot.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great way to get caught up on a series we missed the first time around.  We watched for hours and were sad when we were out of expisodes to watch.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love this album. I just like to tune out, lay back, and listen to this album. It's kind of my go to musc now when I want to relax. Some of it's a little faster pace I just like to relax to faster music. It has a mellow yet insistent sound. Definitely go to buy more of their stuff when it's available.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|The story itself is horribly ridiculous, even within its own world of contrivances.  I am still stunned that absolutely every aspect of the story is so groaningly, eye-rollingly ridiculous.<br /><br />The acting is good, but marred by the awful story and dialog.<br /><br />The special effects are good, but are also marred by the awful story.<br /><br />I, however, can not say that the direction is good, because a good director would have changed E V E R Y T H I N G.  Yes, even Ridley Scott can make stinkers (and this one isn't his first).<br /><br />Basically, without a good story, you have nothing but well-done crap running around in a ridiculous plot saying and doing ridiculous things.  And that's exactly what we have here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. I have a problem trying to find the sequels on Amazon though. It's as if your company does not have the rights to them and you are inundated with books ABOUT the books, references, crap about everything but the two actual sequels.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book was eerily similar to 50 Shades of Grey, similar scenes & phrases but all in all it was a good read.
B00785P2QC|4.0|If virtual games is your thing you will definitely love this. An extra bonus is that the app is free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Grand daughter plays it more than I do on the Kindle, but she loves it!!! Now if she could only beat her young nephews score.....
B0066WJLU6|2.0|LED only  works on camera, so if something else is using it, then the LED  is useless. Also the colors really don't have a purpose for me.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|not normally my style of reading, but found i just couldn't put these books down, also on a few topics found them interesting.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Bruce Willis is a legit action hero. Gritty characters, excellent story line and Willis actually shows wear and tear throughout the movie. Must-have for the action movie junkie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was not a typical thriller. It had me hooked from the beginning and I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read more novels by this author!
B000NPF5ZC|5.0|Perfectly Balanced Studio Recording. Every Instrument comes out evenly<br /><br />My favorite from the monolithic Crimson King!<br /><br />Give it a listen, yeh?
B000001DU5|5.0|This was replacement for a scratched CD.  The songs are still as good as I remembered.  If you are in to the 80's music, this is a must have CD to your collection.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|*SPOILER ALERT* Although I was admittedly disappointed that Michael did not have a real part in this flick, it was still good enough to keep me interested and certainly good enough to have me looking forward to seeing it again. Hopefully not the last movie in the series!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It is filled with every aspect that a good book should have.  I read this book in less than two days, and I laughed and cried along the way.  I am a sucker for books that take me deep in thought, and that make me feel like I am experiencing each and every emotion with the characters.  This book makes you think hard about the joys and sometimes sorrows that come with love, life, and the past.  This was one of the only books that I have read that truly had me laughing and crying for the characters. It is a MUST READ book.  I have not read any other books by Colleen Hoover, but after this book I plan on reading more of her works!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I have pretty slow internet at my house, so I gave the free version at try first and it worked just like they said. I can access and edit documents and play games. I can't believe that this is all provided for free. People that complain because they can only access there computer through their home network are just selfish in my opinion. The paid version is only 5 dollars that allows remote use, a small price to pay for an app that does so much and cost much more to develop. It is free what do you expect. I will probably not use the app remotely too much because people have said that with lack of encryption your information is not safe, but I bought the app to support the developer and to thank them for making a great product.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This search tool does not function very well on my kindle fire. It loads ok but then does not allow enlargement of the text, if i get a page at all.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I usually listen to country music but I kept hearing songs from this artist while traveling with my boyfriend and I finally decided that I was going to find out who was singing these songs! I was surprised when I found out that it was an artist from the UK! I decided to download the album and buy it as well so I could listen to it and needless to say I haven't been listening to country music for at least 2 weeks now! I think I have &#34;worn out&#34; this CD because it is so fabulous! I urge everyone who usually does not listen to this type of music to give it a try! She is a very talented and wonderful singer! I hope she comes out with some new music soon as I cannot wait to hear it!
B007EPESOS|4.0|Interesting facts indeed, though the language was quite difficult for a foreign reader (Swede). I found myself looking up 1-2 words per page, which quite slowed down the reading process.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I like this app a lot, but some features are missing from the paid version that were in the free copy. The toolbar in the free version was a lot easier to toggle on and off then it is in the paid copy. Also there is no longer a log off button that I can find. This makes it more difficult to close. Not sure why these features weren't I included, but I would find them helpful.
B00594XOZU|5.0|ITS GOOD BUT IT TENDS TO FORCE CLOSE ALOT AND U CANT DE LOGGED INTO MORE THAN ONE DEVICE BUT ITS REALLY GOOD
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The only reason I own this bag, is because it came for free with the purchase of my canon camera kit I bought at amazon.  It looks like it was made for Amazon, as it has amazon written on the zipper handles.  It appears to be well made but is too big for my needs.  I have a canon T4i with the 18-135 lens, plus the 55-250 lens, plus manuals and charger and I am swimming in this bag.  I could store twice as much as I have.  This bag has several pockets on the front and back of the top cover, has many moveable partitions in the main compartment and would work great for someone with a 1/2 dozen lenses.  I purchased a medium sized SLR bag from Case Logic, so I can more easily carry around the items I REALLY need to take pictures.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|The acting was good, but the story seemed to fall apart toward the end.  I would have liked more of Travolta's character involvement to be told.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book made me think that I was in the story. I was pulled in. It seemed so real.  The attention to detail is mind blowing. Even if Brad Pitt is starring in the movie, the silver screen can't tell the story you will get reading this book.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|ITSS GOOODD OMGAAA BUY IT ITS ONLY RITE . TRUST MEE ITS WONDERFULL OMGAAA LOL . BUT YEA DEFINETLY BUY ITS ITS REALLY WORTH IT
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have all of Vince Flynn's books and would recommend them to anyone who loves a good story and loves intrigue, mystery with a strong character like Mitch Rapp!!!!  Can't wait for his next book!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I read the books.  I thought some parts were interesting, but other parts were very dull and I would get distracted easily while reading.  This book is definitely not for everyone.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|A combination of a great timely story line and superb acting.  I became addicted in the first episode and am anxiously awaiting season 3.
1416572295|5.0|Granted, I will admit that there wasn't as many quips as a Dave Barry book, but Chad made quantum physics easier to understand and quite humorous.  This book has helped me understand photography to a much greater level, too.  I would recommend this book to anyone with a desire to learn and photographers.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I am on my fifth attempt at downloading 329.9mb of resources.  It gets to the end of the download, then starts up again.  How many times do I have to do this so I can commence the game!  Pity anyone on restricted download limits.  I am already over a gig of download and still cant play it.  Not good enough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought I was going to lose my mind when Katniss and Peeta are forced into the arena again. I want the third book. Now! Lol
B000654YRY|5.0|This DVD is excellent. I can't speak highly enough about it.<br /><br />Great music, great camera work.<br /><br />Love it. Mesmerising!! I can't remember how many times that I've watched it now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|like the best supersize caculator ever!  As i get older it will sure come in handy when my eyes start to fail.. Many thanks to the developer and look forward to whatever else you got..
B005LAIGSM|2.0|I sold it back to amazon, It was too much hipe and when I've watch the movie I just didn't like, it wasn't my cup of tea.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|What a great movie! It is excellent for both children and adults. Furthermore, it contains humor, a great plot, and loveable characters.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Love the book, love Harry Bosch.  It downloaded perfectly and was enjoyed by all who read it.  Thanks so much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished it fast. It was so good I couldn't put it down. It was the best book I ever read.
B004R2DS9C|4.0|This box is decorated exactly as my lego lover would like.  The size is good, the zippers have worked well so far, and my son likes to zip it down into a play mat and then store his creations inside when he's done.  A good experience with it.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is a very fun game. The neon colors are very fun to stare at. Furthermore, there are several different game boards to choose from! I highly recommend this game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just started watching this series and I am hooked. Love the story lines and dry humor, and a look into days and an era gone by. Love being able to catch up on the past seasons with Amazon video on demand!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a must have app for you kindle, allows to side load apps and keep your kindles files organized and easy to search
B003K16P3M|5.0|One bad thing about reading mostly in one genre is finding the same tropes over and over. I've read some fantastic YA and some not-so-fantastic YA, and this book falls into the category of fantastic for some really big reasons. But, more than anything, what I really liked about the novel is that it avoids most of the tropes that seem to be littered all over YA lit: there's no love triangle, the heroine is strong and capable, and the characters are a part of the world rather than the world simply being a vehicle for telling a romance. Spoilers to follow.<br /><br />I don't see how I can review this book without addressing its feminist message. I can understand how some readers would be put off by it, but I personally didn't feel as if the author was beating me over the head with it. Instead, I simply felt that the message was an essential part of Katsa's character and, moreover, I understood precisely why Katsa felt as she did. That's not to say that I didn't think the author was a little too severe at times, but I wouldn't have found it at all realistic of Katsa up and decided she wanted to get married and have babies at the end. It's pretty patronizing to believe that all women aspire to be mothers, even if they're adamant that they don't want to be mothers, as Katsa is. It didn't seem to me that the message here was that having children was a bad thing, just that it didn't appeal to Katsa. Because of this, I thought it was entirely responsible of her to make the decision not to have children--it's not something anyone should go into unless they're willing to accept the responsibility. As for the marriage end of things, it also made sense to me that Katsa didn't want to get married. The world of Graceling dictates that women are the property of men. Even given Po's open-mindedness and respect for Katsa, she would still technically be his property and subject to his rules. Perhaps Katsa would feel differently if the laws governing marriage were different, but that'sreally neither here nor there. Katsa is operating as best she can within the confines of the system, and I thought that made perfect sense.<br /><br />The reason why the marriage message in particular didn't bother me is because it seemed clear to me that Cashore wasn't saying that a relationship of equals was out of the question. One of my favorite things about the book was Po and his attitude toward Katsa and their relationship. Po respects Katsa and loves her, flaws and all. When he expresses a desire to protect her, it's out of a sense of love and not wanting someone he cares about to suffer, not because he thinks her incapable of taking care of herself. I found Katsa and Po's relationship to be very give and take. Each makes sacrifices for the other, and each respects the other. It was one of the best portrayals of a relationship I've seen in YA lit, and Po was one of the best love interests I've ever encountered. Since Katsa is so adamantly against marriage, it made me respect Po even more that he accepted her position and didn't try to press the issue. Because of his love and respect for her, he understood why she felt as she did and he acted accordingly.<br /><br />Another aspect I really liked about the book was the path Katsa carves out for herself. She takes control of her own life and finds a way to bring about some positive change in her world, which I thought was very admirable. Yes, Katsa does rail against the injustice in her world, but rather than sit back and passively accept it, she decides to do something about it, and she does so in a realistic way. She can't change an entire culture on her own, so she finds a way to alter it ever so slightly, in a way that's sure to have a positive effect on the women Katsa touches. What made this even more meaningful is that Katsa decides to pursue what she feels is her calling in life, even if it means she and Po will have to be apart at times. There's nothing wrong with making sacrifices for love, but it was wonderful to read a YA book in which the heroine decides that her own needs and goals are just as important as those of the man she loves. I felt this was further proof of the solidity of their relationship: each of them encourages the other to do what they feel they need to do.<br /><br />The world building in this book is excellent. I had a real feel for the setting, and the idea of the Graces was fantastic and really well thought out. The fact that there is a price to be paid for being Graced, that society looks on the Gracelings with a suspicious eye was a strong aspect of the narrative. I appreciated that the author explored the idea of what it means to have such a huge responsibility, how such an ability can be both a gift and a burden to bear.<br /><br />I initially had misgivings about reading this book because I'd read some negative comments about the book's underlying messages. I'm glad that I set aside my reluctance and read the book. I thought it was extremely well written with a vividly drawn world and compelling characters. I'm not always a fan of fantasy because I feel it devolves into the realm of the too fantastical, so I enjoyed reading a fantasy book that felt so well-grounded. The characters were people, not mythological creatures with awesome, limitless power, and I thought that was a very good thing. Their peril felt real, and the emotion in the book really resonated with me.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Relax Melodies is a great app and I highly recommend it. There are many different sounds to choose from such as night, campfire, rain, and city noise. All of the sounds are high quality. The layout of the app is also wonderful and very fun to look at.
1416972242|4.0|City of Ashes hooked me in just like the first book, City of Bones. A page turner and definitely did not disappoint!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The show it self needs no help! What a great performance and storyline. The special features on the disk were very helpful.
B005XI9456|4.0|This was a gag gift for a friend. We are older and make jokes about Justin. We both enjoy the album very much.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|does what it says it does. keeps track of battery charge, estimates time till charge used up for various types of activities, and how long until fully charged again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There is not much more to say besides its amazing! This book is filled with drama, passion, hope fear just everything you can think of. Its definitely a page turner. The best part is that colleen wrote it to where I can feel every emotion the characters do. Its just amazing in every way. I don't read much but I will definitely be reading this again!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|great time killer! I feel a smidge smarter each round.<br />could have used a hint ft rather than that whole mushroom growth thing!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|If you love to draw then you will love this game. You can play friends, family members or just play random players.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great price.  Great series.  Can't wait for the new shows to start.  Lots of other good &#34;walking dead&#34; items to purchase also.
B008602KQI|5.0|this whole series was fabulous...kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time not one of the series ever disappointed me
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was s wonderful read. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. There isn't much I didn't like and I'd give it to my grown daughter.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is getting older and I just didn't have the can't put it down syndrome that plaques me normally... Not Connelly's best but hey, he's had a great run and I will probably buy every book he ever produces as he is consistent.
B00000K3D4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE<br /><br />EVERY KIDS SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE.  IF YOU LIKE MUSIC OR IF YOU LIKE DAVID BOWIE YOU WILL DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King in years, and was reminded what a good author he is.  Good story, excellent writing!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|The book kept me interested.  I was eager to continue reading even after I was sleepy.  Took it with me on a trip.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour bookstore was such a delight to read! There were so many things I like about this book. Really, what other novel would have programming languages such as C and Ruby mentioned in its contents, albeit briefly?? I didn't even realize those terms can be used outside the IT world. And come on, programming languages in fiction?? That even sounds like a joke - but it's not! And I love it!<br /><br />Aside from the techy stuff, I also enjoyed the way that books were in the center of the story. Of course the setting was in a bookstore, but aside from that, the author added little details that tugged at the heartstrings of book lovers like me. I couldn't help but smile while reading about the smell of real books, emergence of ebooks, and Kindle. It's like a breath of fresh air. It's so THIS generation.<br /><br />But I think the best thing about this book is its impeccable storytelling. When I was reading it, I felt really connected with the story. Maybe because there were many things I (and a lot of people, I'm sure) could relate to - web design, Kindle, books, fruit ninja, etc. The book was written in the first person point-of-view and because it was both funny and oozing with charm, I felt like I wanted to be friends with Clay and his super talented friends if only they're real. Honestly, I was more interested on what the main character would \\"think\\" and do than what mystery he will solve in the end. Don't get me wrong, the plot is okay - not mind boggling, but it was okay. I think this is the only book that kept me reading not so much because I was too excited to know how it will end but because the storytelling was wickedly good!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|so much fun my 4 yr old plays it n we laugh at what the monsters say cant get enuf
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game combines addicting Facebook games with adorable ponies and fun mini games! Best of all? IT'S FREE! Love it.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Not your typical Sherlock fare.This is quirky, gritty, and a very original slant on the ancient Sherlock slow moving, pipe smoking, brilliant character. Johnny Lee Miller does great work developing a complex role in a modern world of smart phones, tv´s, and, computers. The best detective show to come along in years.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A clearly written account of an extraordinary experience that is difficult to explain on medical grounds.  Not absolute proof but leaves you thoughtful about this possibility.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great. Verry addictive. Tye only issue I experience with it is going to other peoples lands. But that is minor. This game is great.
B003VANOFY|3.0|First of all - Sound Quality. This IS the best sound quality for gaming next to Plantronics Commanders, Audio Technica ATH-AD700, and Sennheiser products. I owned the Logitech g35's and I believe the bass quality was better wired, and I have received numerous comments that the microphone was better on my old g35's.<br /><br />Second, CHEAP QUALITY. I had to buy this because my g35's broke. There's a piece where the screws are above the earpieces that broke THE EXACT same way on both sides after 1 year of use. Of course logitech claims it as \\"USER ERROR\\" even though it's an obvious flaw in their production. I bought a Square Trade warranty in case these break.<br /><br />Third, the price. The price/performance of Logitech headsets is GREAT. Audiotechnica AD700's are next in line ($100, but no mic, so get a nice mic +$20) Logitech does a great job of 7.1 surround sound which I absolutely love watching movies, listening music too as well as gaming. The sound quality is just amazing. There is a stereo to surround switch that never gets used, not sure why it's there, but it's a good way to show the difference of 2.1 to 7.1.<br /><br />The battery, most important of all. I see people bitching about it. I have owned this for almost 30 days now. I game for 7-8 hours it will last. Even when it runs low it gives you different beeps. The cord is long, so I just plug in and play. I have 1 problem though. there's a slight \\"Zezezeez\\" sound of static in the background when it's plugged in. That could be because of my USB station that I have extended from my PC, but it is powered and has a lot of amperage. Static sound is always there when charging, barely noticed unless you are browsing.<br /><br />Wireless capabilities: I went outside and walked out about 100ft. It has the same range as my wireless router. After a certain length they just cut out. The wireless is AMAZING with 2.4 ghz. I don't have any interference problems, or random static when wireless.<br /><br />So, overall Ihave this 3 stars. Cheap build quality like the Logitech g35's I owned, static when charging, loss of microphone quality compared to the wired brother (g35). Pro's: Amazing sound for the price, great wireless capabilities, comfortable.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't believe I have to wait until 2014 for the last one, but I know it will be worth it!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Great movie with lots of action! Liam Neeson is perfect as the father of kidnapped teen in a foreign country.
1416583432|5.0|My beloved irish setter died last year, so when someone gave me this book I thought it would be another sob story about losing a dog. As such I put it off. Egads, was I wrong! This book is a scientific look at dogs and actually explains how dogs perceive us humans. I wish I'd read this book when my dear Glory was still alive. I would have been such a better human companion. Please, please don't miss out on reading this book. This author is a genius.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Such a good story with a horrible and disappointing ending!!  It had such potential and ended up being such a let down!
B001KZG99A|5.0|I loved the Dark Knight.  I loved Batman Begins.  They are great movies.  But I ask myself, would I watch either over and over again - not so much.  This movie pulls that off.  Robert Downey Jr. is charming, engaging, funny, as Tony Stark.  The movie is fast paced and exciting, the evolution of Ironman well thought out, and believable.
067144901X|5.0|And start with this one. Her books are fantastic. Amusing for the reader and the read to. This was one my son and I would tell together by heart - me with the words and him with the sounds. Great memory!
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I loved this movie, it was true to the story and the acting was amazing! Great cast! And the costumes were lovely.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I really love this movie. I mean thats why I bought it. Nice price 5USD, I cannot ask for more.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|What works in Ironman?  It is a FUN movie.  Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark.  It has action, comedy, and excellent pacing.  Too bad Thor did not learn that lesson...it wanted to be the Dark Knight, but did not have the gravitas to pull that off.  The parts were all there but the package seemed incomplete.
0920668364|1.0|Please tell me I will not become like this freaky mom. Buy &#34;Guess How Much I Love You&#34; and you will get the same message in a much more beautiful way.
B0009MDPYW|4.0|great movie my husband loved it he has been looking this movie so when he opened it he immediately stopped what he was doing and watched it .l way to go
0062101897|5.0|This book is huge!! really huge!! and with A LOT information about harry potter, so what are you waiting for? 45USD is nothing because this is a awesome book!!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Captain America is well done.  Chris Evans does a marvelous job as Steve Rogers and Captain America.  Haley Atwell is both beautiful and convincing as Peggy Carter, the British Agent/liason to Col Phillips (the always great Tommy Lee Jones)  who watches the development of the hero Captain America, while mentoring the man, Steve Rogers.  All the &#34;loose threads&#34; in the Marvel Universe eventually get tied up and this movie, with Ironman, Thor, and the Hulk lead us to the Avengers.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved how the story alternated between husband and wife each chapter, each telling his/her version. Not sure how I feel about the ending though. Lost a couple hours sleep each night while reading since I didn't want to stop!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What a delightful story, if it didn't end I'd still be reading! Allen is so unbelievably likeable that he brings out the best in the characters he meets. Read it - you will love it.
B00AXVIFSA|5.0|.<br /><br />This review is of Seasons 1, 2, and the first episode of Season 3.  I'll be watching the rest of Season 3 as it becomes available.<br /><br />I want to avoid spoilers or plot giveaways, so I'll just describe overall characteristics of the show.<br /><br />This fascinating, serious drama evinces a subtle, generous love of humanity, and makes you love humanity, the wonderful qualities, the foibles, and the frailties, and how all that stands up to the darker side of human nature.  The writing is excellent; the show's plot always has me on edge.  Out of dozens of characters two or three are bad and rather wicked, but on the whole it seems every episode moves me at some point to shed a tear or two because of the kindness and goodness and generosity of various characters.  And it's not that the writers set out in a contrived way to do that.  It all unfolds very naturally out of the drama itself.<br /><br />The show is not a comedy, but there are touches of humor here and there that manage to be moving even as they amuse.  The show is about an extended family of the British aristocracy and their servants.  The daughters are looking to get married.  So are some of the servants.  There is even a murder.  Oh, yes, and World War I is going on during a number of episodes, involving all the characters in huge changes.  And it turns out there are some beautifully noble qualities in some of these titled nobles, as well as in a number of their servants.  The few characters with a more or less sinister side just add more drama, nuance, and depth to a show that on the whole reveals the best of human beings, without oversimplifying them.  Something about this show trusts human beings.  It makes me think that perhaps the best of Britain is something \\"very good indeed.\\"
B0098VXE50|4.0|The style and visual effects are good.  The change in Snow Whites Character is good.  BUT it is the queen, Charlize Theron that steals the show.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|Classic text book for New Thought Students.  The compact Kendal edition makes it readily available and always at hand for classes and discussion points.
0765325950|1.0|No e-book gets my one-star protest. Bad decision and I have no other practical means of getting that across. If the problem is Bestseller Lists, then lobby to change how Bestseller Lists are determined. Don't cut off your nose (readers/customers) to spite your face.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|DVDs are of great quality and clarity.<br />A great purchase for any fan of Columbo - at a not very expensive pricel
B009CGAAQM|4.0|Blast from the past. Liked the movie but watching you have to explain whats going on a lot. we may have still had zip tops on cans when this happened.
B00008GKEG|5.0|We really enjoyed the DVD set.  Each DVD provided an understanding of what was going on with the Beatles at that time in their band.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was not shocked at all by the sexuality of this book.  It didn't do it for me and I didn't care what happened to the characters since they weren't developed enough.  Dumb dumb dumb.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! Once you start you can't put it down! Hoover does an impeccable job at captivating the reader's attention, emotions, and heart.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As an aspiring writer (translated - have a million stories running through my head but no writing experience) I must admit I downloaded this book for the sheer purpose of seeing how a successful self/Kindle-published book reads. Not being a huge fan of science-fiction, I truly did not expect to love this story as much as I do! I've read all 7 parts and can't wait until the 8th is released! The plot is very compelling and I felt an immediate connection with the main characters (and without giving anything away will say I'm excited to have hear that one will finally return in part 8!) This book was extremely well written and edited and I have recommended it to all of my friends. I love that each book reveals a little bit more insight into how this civilization has become what it is. Something inside me just longs for them to go \\"outside\\"...yes, I said it! ;) I hope we get to experience that at some point in this amazing series!
B007SGM084|5.0|The book is very interesting, you do not want to stop reading it. It is not only the sexual content that makes it interesting it is Christian's Grey personality and power which will attract most of women.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing twist this story takes. I loved it!!! I would tell everyone to read this book. I actually kinda miss the book, I got so into it. Amazing!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the hunger games<br />I think that kattniss is still going to fall  in love with him<br />I think she's going to get in trouble for almost eating those berries
B005FPT51K|5.0|Being a modern parent I wanted a little more than just an audio monitor, friends have one of these and recommended it to us, after messing around with a standard IP Camera (which turns out was a cheap knock off) I decided to give this one a try and have not looked back since.  The night vision mode is brilliant and really clear.  One thing I would love to be added is a mac app, they have windows and iOS but no OSX
145210655X|3.0|We bought this for a 3-year-old who is quite a fan of Darth Vadar.  The book is not a story.  Rather it is a collection of cartoon jokes that he doesn't really get.  He doesn't know the difference, but it's not what we expected.
B0091REZMW|4.0|sometimes the game can feel monotonous but it is possible to play without diamonds if you have the patience. not good if you only want a quick distraction but a decent long term game
B0058YPL66|5.0|This show let's me escape the real world and step into a world full of characters we have all known and loved. The storyline is complex enough to keep my attention and I love the visual effects as well.
B004QDCZ3M|5.0|Lungs is filled with enjoyable music by Florence and the Machine. I highly recommend their music for anyone that enjoys pop/rock.
0811879542|5.0|It's amazing that this book makes you think you are actually causing things to change on the paper.  Fun to read with a child.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|i bought this for my super Les Mis fan, my wife, and we listened to it together several times before seeing the movie on opening day.  It is great and any Les Mis fan must have it!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Wow!!!  interesting concept.  Acting was good.  After watching this film and it sunk in, I almost believe it really could have happened.  Then I woke up the next morning and found bite marks on my cats neck and a tall black top hat lying next to her.......... hum
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I didn't know much about this group when I bought this CD as a gift. However, I have come to enjoy the music and I think that others will too.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This CD made the perfect gift for my friend who loves the TV show Nashville. Every song she talks about the episode and some songs havent featured yet, which makes her more excited to keep watching.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I rated 4 out of 5 stars. To me it is wonderful book. Excellent. Enjoyable. Fast paced.  I will definitely read other Mitch Albom books. If I put 5 stars on it, this book would have be my best book of the year or best of all I ever read. Well I had other book that I like the best.<br /><br />I like the way the author put a few characters came together at the end. Science Fiction. Unique. Time related. Year from 4000 BC to 2012 AD. Dor, Father Time, was confined solitarily in the cave for about 6,000 years for trying to measure God's gift of time. His mind and body never been aged. Until many years later, he was released but he needed to help other people's problem before he started to age again.<br /><br />I was a little irked by the name: Dor.  Later I think I understood what Mitch Albom was trying to tell us that he was coming from 4000 BC. His year and culture were different than ours.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any of you who would enjoy something different and unique with time.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Visuals were great, just an awful lot like Alien.  It definitely was a Ridley Scott film  :)  :)  You could feel it there, so that was cool.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Not quite up to the TV reviews but still an enjoyable childrens movie. Definitely something new but a little deep in some spots for the young.
1595827684|5.0|I'm an avid Mass Effect fan and being able to find a book with new material is great! Benjamin Huen's work really shines here. I saw that this book is also available in eBook/Kindle form, but the hard cover copy is the way to go, especially with the big glossy pages.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie kept me revited in my seat the whole time. Willis is great and Morgan Freeman is outstanding. Good plot.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a fun read and my first Kindle book.  I'm sure I will get more as the winter goes on now that the holidays are over.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The Lumineers have a great sound and it is very apparent in this CD. All of the cuts are in the &#34;Easy to listen to&#34; category. I highly recommend this CD to popular music enthusiasts.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Very entertaining show. As a dude...I don't care for all of the lovey dovey stuff. But the vampire scenes are fantastic and the plot is extremely well done.<br /><br />This show is a more mild version of True Blood. Not nearly as much sex/violence/cursing as its HBO cousin. I am a little old school, so I like that there aren't boobs in every scene. This show is just as good (if not better) than True Blood simply because the show doesn't have to flaunt sex in every scene just to keep people interested. Plus the Vampire Diaries doesn't have fairies. Which is always a plus in my mind.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0063GORYU|4.0|best game I played online. fast pace, easy to learn. great way to pass the time waiting for appointments. would recommend to everyone.

B008P1EWIM|3.0|I wanted it to be more. I do not go to it everyday and that is what I wanted. I expected it to be zeroed in on my area and it is not. read reviews before I downloaded and it had the best.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This is a new favorite for my 5 and 6-year-old boys!  Their dad and I also enjoyed.  Grand Santa makes the movie!

B000P12LWY|5.0|It did not take long for me to become, \\"hooked\\" on this DVD series. To begin with, I find the costumes that people wore during the 1500's beautiful ~ especially the elegant dresses the women wore! In addition to the fantastic acting and scenery, I enjoyed the musical score that accompanies this series. After watching seasons 1 and 2, I plan to view seasons 3 and 4. Viewing the first two seasons of \\"The Tudors\\", has inspired me to research more information about Henry Tudor and his many wives.
B009CPES4I|4.0|l LOVE Judy. I am 76 So there are not very many movies that deal with seniors problems.I could relate as I have just recently was laid off from my job which has made me regards my finances.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this was definitely worth the money!! my son and I stayed busy with this game for hours. I would certainly recommend this game.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This is GREAT!  The combination of bright colors, music, and lights really entertains the baby!  It is obvious she LOVES it, and anything she loves, we love.  It is difficult to find a mobile that is geared to the baby's vision, with bright colors the baby can actually see!  Pastels can't be seen by babies until they are much older.  I HIGHLY recommend this mobile!
B00005JKHP|5.0|Always wanted to buy it ! Some people thought it was boring but I really loved it. Everyone looked young and the story was great !
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Loved all the actors. could relate to the time. Boy Scout Camp awesome.Loved the schoolhouse effect of the home. Very unique in every way. Will watch again.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Beginning to end, a hilarious and thoughtful read. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to think and laugh.  If you don't like thinking and laughing, you probably shouldn't read it, though.  If you happen to be a member of that set, just curious, but what do you do with your time?  More significantly, how did you come to be reading a review of this book?
B009AMALGM|3.0|WOW THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY I DONT KNOW IF I WOULD GO SEE IT AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO BUY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4: UNRATED EDITION (DVD) GO TO AMAZON.COM
B002LFAHBO|5.0|It's one of her favorite movies.<br /><br />It's my first time watching a movie on Blue Ray.<br /><br />Thanks for sending it quickly.
B005LAII8K|5.0|This movie is so great, I had to watch it twice in one sitting. And it got better, the second time around.  This is a very well done action, science fiction movie.  I can't think of one story plot hole, or acting problem to list here. The pacing is perfect. The scenes are well done.  The mix of narration, dialogue and scenes explain everything very well.  You MUST pay attention to the details, though, for it to make sense. Watch it, buy it, it's a fun movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't watch the show when it first came on...the title alone made me think it was something I would not enjoy.  Got my daughter the first season for Christmas and I started watching it.  Although it is quite violently graphic when it comes to killing the &#34;walkers&#34;, I have truly become mesmerized by the cast of characters and their interpersonal relationships.  Looking forward to see where the story goes throughout the rest of season 3.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I used to love this app. Everything worked fine, but lately I noticed it wasn't installed anymore so I checked here and now it's not compatible with my Kindle Fire HD.. made me really sad, since it used to be compatible - and it's a great app :/
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Me and my wife were catching up on the series on Netflix, but season 4 was not available, and we wanted to be caught up before the start of season 5.  We purchased the entire season as soon as it was available and watched it online.  Good picture quality, and it is still not available of Netflix.
0446554995|4.0|I have mixed feelings about the last several Pendergast novels, the \\"Helen\\" trilogy in particular. Two Graves are solid. It's a good read and I wanted to know how it ends. It's nice that this one wraps up the \\"Helen\\" trilogy and we learn a lot more about Constance Green. But...I miss some of the old Pendergast. The Pendergast of Relic and Still Life with Crows. The brooding, Sherlockian Pendergast who pulls on the threads of an unusual scenario and then finally springs to action to catch a killer is still my favorite.<br /><br />I'm of the opinion that some characters should develop and other characters really shouldn't. They should be the anchor around which other characters grow. In the early books, Pendergast was the anchor. D'Agosta, Corrie and others grew around Pendergast. In the last few books we more development of Pendergast and I'm less excited about it. I miss the mystery that was Pendergast.<br /><br />As others have commented, the subplot with Corrie Swanson seems out of place. It feels like they are setting us up for a series starring her. What I would love to see in a future book is a Pendergast backstory, how did he come to join the FBI? Why to they pay him a dollar a year?<br /><br />All in all, a good book. Maybe not the direction I was hoping for, but good none the less.
B000002J1U|5.0|This was the worst reviewed Zeppelin album upon its release, but now it receives just as much praise as the other albums, and rightfully deserved.<br /><br />It just wasn't what fans were expecting at that time. Zeppelin 2 was fully of hard rocking riffs, and after hearing Immigrant Song, you would think this album is going to give you the same. Then the rest of the album are a bunch of acoustic songs, and you're wondering \\"what happened?\\"<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Zeppelin albums, and Jimmy Page shows us just how amazing of an acoustic guitar player he is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down! Its an amazing love story that over comes major odds. I loved it and can't wait to read the third book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So here I am, nearly a year after I received a kindle fire for my birthday, (and at least 150 read books later) and I am writing my very first review! I have read TONS of books that I have just loved but this book has moved me to my core. I would fail not only you as the possible reader, but the author as well, if I were to try and sum up this book. I failed miserably trying to recall it to my husband before just huffing and puffing and giving up. It has been two days since I have finished and my thoughts are still consumed with this story. So here is my review... READ IT! You will not be sorry!
1400067820|5.0|In principle I do not write reviews for Amazon on books already discussed by many. But this is an exception, because of the outstanding importance of the book combined with my feeling that published reviews miss at least one critical issue, epitomized by the author's statement \\"We need to...\\" (p. 412). But no agency which may act upon the crucial insights and recommendations is indicated. In this respect the book, however iconoclastic and paradigm-leaping, follows the usual reliance on some deus ex machine.<br />Taleb is too knowledgeable in the ways of the world to expect his moral insights to change actual behavior, or his ideas on antifragility to bring about a metamorphosis in the thinking of Nobel Prize economists. Hopefully, with time fuller recognition of Black Swan effects, possibilities to strengthen antifragility, ways to think on very small probabilities (p. 454) and so on may percolate into the minds of those who matter, adding up to a kind of paradigm shift. But humanity may not have so much time.<br />A current and a global futures example: What insights can be gained from the book on the problem of Iran moving towards nuclear weapons? And, to move to humanity as a whole, a robust prediction (yes, there can be some such predictions despite the counterclaim of the author) is that science and technology will supply easily available instruments of mass killing, and these are very likely to be misused for the worst by diverse fanatic \\"true believers\\" (a reality well known to the author in view of his background, as interestingly mentioned in the book).  Consequently, prevention of production and diffusion of mass-killing instruments is imperative, leading to the need for a strong global security regime, contrary, however based on subsidiarity, to a main line of thinking of the book if I sense it correctly.<br />Therefore, critical audiences for the book include the relatively very few who exert significant influence on the future of most of humanity. Accordingly, senior politicians and their policy advisors, as well as public interest thinkers, must urgently study this book and apply it. And it would be good if the author would help by devoting his next book to the domain of public-political action.<br /><br />Professor Yehezkel Dror<br />The Hebrew University of Jerusalemdingly, senior politicians and their policy advisors, as well as public interest thinkers, must urgently study this book and apply it.

B000002JSN|5.0|This is why Zeppelin is the best. Every single Zeppelin album is awesome, some more awesome than others, and Physical Graffiti is my favorite Rock album of all time. This is the album that never gets old and every time I listen to it, it's a reminder of why I love rocknroll.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is a wonderful book! I enjoyed every page. I don't understand why anyone would complain and put down a book. It is fiction after all.....
B0031RS58I|4.0|This is a lovely light-hearted read; the author demonstrates an endearing humour in this charming engaging story.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a light, easy, amusing read.
0345803485|2.0|Reading this book does not answer the question, and no, it's not about a Sherwin-Williams salesperson.<br /><br />The point-of-view woman, Anastasia Steele, is a recent college graduate, who perhaps experienced kissing but, unbelievably, is a virgin. The other unbelievable person is Christian Grey, a 27 year-old CEO billionaire, who possesses the usual billionaire trappings--jet, helicopter, luxury cars, chauffer, maid, monster apartment with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Seattle skyline, and walls of art masterpieces. However, he's the son of a \\"crack-whore.\\"<br /><br />The first seven chapters are focused on the rather mundane life and attitudes of Anastasia, who is instantly smitten when she interviews Christian for a local magazine, and for the rest of the book there's an avalanche of thesaurus modifiers for this handsome man--smoldering gray gaze, freaking hot, a dazzling, unguarded, natural, all-teeth showing, glorious smile, dark smoky gray eyes, dark copper-colored hair, beautiful sculptured lips, the epitome of male beauty. And over and over and over he \\"runs his fingers through his hair\\" and she \\"bites her lower lip.\\"<br /><br />Some creative descriptions: \\"He smiles, but the smile doesn't touch his eyes.\\" \\"His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel.\\"<br /><br />If the reader searches for sex scenes, the first one, plain vanilla, is in Chapter 8. And though feeling a \\"quivering mass of raging female hormones,\\" Anastasia must question a man that says, \\"I don't do the girlfriend thing.\\" Then, Christian asks her to sign a contract before they have more sex. The printed contract specifies Christian as The Dominant and Anastasia as The Submissive. The non-disclosure agreement outlines terms such as required obedience, sleep, food, clothes, and exercise; the possibilities of masturbation, cunnilingus, and vibrators; the types of bondage and restraint; plus deserving punishments for breaking rules like caning, whipping, and hot wax.<br /><br />A troubled Anastasia ponders the contract, the fact that previously fifteen other women had agreed to these terms, the conditions that she must not touch him or sleep over, and his youthful sexual relationship with an older woman, a friend of his adoptive mother. But mainly Anastasia wants to be more than number sixteen, that is, she craves love, however, her instant arousals and thundering orgasms scream yes to his every demand. On the other hand, controlling Christian desires only sex per his direction in his scary \\"playroom\\" of erotic equipment, definitely not love, though he surprises himself by progressively allowing Anastasia latitudes beyond the contract.<br /><br />The one-dimensional characters and tiresome story line make this a dull read. I struggled to finish the book.t wax.<br /><br />A troubled Anastasia ponders the contract, the fact that previously fifteen other women had agreed to these terms, the conditions that she must not touch him or sleep over, and his youthful sexual relationship with an older woman, a friend of his adoptive mother.

B005LAII80|5.0|I do not read the comic so the only other exposure to the Judge I had was the Stallone movie. NOT EVEN CLOSE! This was a really great movie. I loved the villain and it has violence and bloodshed with plenty of gore throughout. However the MEGA CITY shots could have been better to give the viewer a better idea of the scale the massive block buildings are supposed to be. The 3D was OK especially when viewing the scenes when the character is on the drug SLO-MO. The most spectacular thing about it was the sound, it was loud and in 7.1 surround. My house sounded like a war zone watching this movie. The feel of the cinematography made it seem more lifelike and grittier. Karl Urban was great in the role putting anything Stallone did to shame. Lena Heady was FANTASTIC as Ma-Ma, one of the most ruthless villains I have seen in a while. For the price ($19.99) it is a great addition to your 3D video library.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably  in one of my top five favourite books by Nicholas sparks. It's an amazing book that will keep you on your toes and guessing what happens next. I can usually guess the ending of books but not this one.
B006KP3XCQ|2.0|We used this as a Christmas Gift and had it shipped directly to our friends. We were told that cover of the movie was really messed up. Disc was good. Considering it was a gift we would like to been presented better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good deal for a free game. Easy to play and fairly minimal ad disruptions. Would recommend it.<br />Get a copy.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I read Sherlock Holmes years ago in the Hound of the Baskervilles, and I loved it.  As such, I definitely couldn't pass up the cheap deal on this, and I have not been disappointed.  They stories are all unique and entertaining for works written decades ago.
B002XMGJHG|5.0|This was an amazing album from Europe (before they became famous).<br />This is more of a melodic rock (somewhat metal) album, just like Europe's first album.<br />I rated this album 5 stars because its has many great riffs and nice choruses,<br />and on top of that, it is well composed. Its hard to find a musically rich album like this.
1611134226|5.0|The book totally took me by surprise, and like all the previous Pendergast stories, I just hope there will be another one!!!
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|Slightly overpriced, and some of the items were really not that exciting to assemble or look at once assembled. If you don't care about opening them one at a time and you only want to add this Lego set to your collection, you can get it half-price in the new year. But if you're like my young daughter and very much *do* care about discovering one new item each day, all the way to Christmas, this is a great buy. She didn't open it before December, and was not peeking ahead of time at the next day's toy. She was excited at the prospect of each new day's surprise, and was overall more pleased than disappointed when she was done putting the items together. Maybe three items in the lot were really “crap”. It’s not the first Lego Advent Calendar box set I get her, and it won’t be the last.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|Simply brilliant debut album. Her voice reminds me of Ruby Turner - Women Hold Up Half the Sky Album.  I look forward to more from this artist in the years to come. Buy it - you won't be disappointed.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|My son loves it !! Brings back memories of a playing as kid!<br />Controlling is weird at times but overall good
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced action adventure. Gives the reader insight as to how the CIA and FBI might work and how easily an agent could become corrupted by the free flowing money used to pay off our adversaries. If you like American Heroes you'll love this book.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Not good at all very disappointed in the movie I didn't even finish watching the movie. Not what expected  I'm sorry I purchased the DVD!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I love Bruno Mars! Great voice, great songs! Music to sing along too or chill out with. Highly recommended buy, you won't regret it!

1594744475|5.0|A few people complain about the use of hot dogs and spam but there are actually only a few recipes with these ingredients.  Unfortunately, they were unable to think outside of the (bento) box.  There are many organic, natural, and nitrate free versions of hot dogs and sausages available today that can easily be substituted for the unhealthy dog.  You can also find nitrate free versions of lunch meat as well.  Regardless, you can always substitute cheese and veggies that can be cut and cubed into those shapes and skip the dogs and meat products all together.  Just use a little bit of creativity.  Isn't that what cooking (and bento) is all about?<br /><br />I also like the fact that the authors include some natural dye ideas for the colors.  I tend to skip the dye portion anyway since my kids are happy with the cute faces regardless of the color.  As for those who say it uses repetetive ingredients.  Well I find that in a lot of my regular box luches already, so this is a welcome addition of new ideas.  I won't be making bento every day anyway, so this just adds more options to their regular lunch fare.  This book is well written and fun.  I am glad I purchased it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|My son loves Legos so this game is perfect! It is very fun for the whole family! My only recommendation is that Lego adds a timer. As us it does not have one so we had to use my phone.
B001QWBM62|4.0|The sound quality isn't perfect, but it's very good and I got this unit at an excellent price; the positives far outshine the negatives, and I'm looking forward to using the H4n in all kinds of contexts: practicing music, recording live shows, and of course the purpose I got it for: recording audio in an indie filmmaking/video context. It's portable, it didn't cost me too much, and it works quite well for the price point. Would I love to have something fancier? Sure. Am I sad about having to use this? Not so far!
B007HO392S|5.0|I love the mellow tones in many of her songs and she sings with her heart as well as with her voice.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was actually a replacement cable from one that was lost/misplaced by Amazon.<br />When I called Customer Support, it was immediately handled and a coupon code was given to me so that the cable was sent completely free!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon - you rock!
B008VBYN80|4.0|fun game. passes the time quickly. keeps my from being bored. would highly recommend to others. very addictive. yaaaaay kingdoms and lords!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Suspenseful love story with characters I instantly fell in love with...I was easily lost in their world,definitely a great read!!!!
B000HC2PCM|5.0|His distinctive voice adds a melancholy feel to the songs he sings that cause them to stay in your head.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I bought this book based on the reviews alone, and I truly didn't know what to expect. This book has touched me in a way that few have. It just gets you at your very core. Charlie is one of the most beloved characters that I've ever read. If you have any misgivings about purchasing this book, cast them aside. Prepare yourself to be so emotionally captivated and moved by his story!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  We have spent (wasted) many hours since trying to solve the puzzle.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews have stated that it is delecate and easily broken.  I have not had any such problems with my puzzle.  However, I can see how you have to be gentle with it.  There are a lot of internal &#34;pins&#34; that could come loose.  There are also many obstacles that have moving parts that could break.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This movie was a fun one my wife and I really enjoyed and I wanted her to be able to enjoy the music from it
B003FSTN5C|5.0|This is an example of taking a good concept and changing the cast and location yet coming up with a terrific show that carries it's own story lines very well.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A great primer on World War I history, I knew the basic background of the politics but this book goes into a great deal of detail from many different perspectives and seems very appropriate for today.  It's so interesting how no one country with the possible exception of Austria wanted the war and yet all of Europe and America is sucked in unwillingly?  Special interests, connections, the different view points are all discussed well.  In this book the fictional characters are likeable, likely and well used to tell history and insights.
0439023491|5.0|These books grabbed my attention from start to finish.  I couldn't put them down.  The story was unique and very well written.

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|The harmonizing is good but the young lady's voice is distinct enought to add a special charm to songs such as If I die young.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|I've been considering this book for a while now and finally decided to go for it.  Afterall, the Kindle price is really nice right now.  And I wasn't disappointed.  I enjoy all the genres this book encompasses and the author did a good job mixing them in.  I liked all the characters and am especially interested in some of them that were supporting cast in this book, such as the human queen and Barrons.  The romance was better developed than I feared it would be, the sex doesn't happen until further into the novel and not til after they develop feelings beyond physical attraction.  Nice build-up between our heroine, Honoria, and Blade, the Demon of White Chapel.<br /><br />I will admit I've read paranormal/steampunk/historical romances that I've thought were better developed and better written ([[ASIN:1420106813 Rebel (The Blades of the Rose)]] comes to mind) but I still found this book very fascinating and I will be reading the next one.  If I had one issue with this story, it was the flimsy excuse the author comes up with for putting Honoria and Blade together in the first place: the elocution lessons.  This was unnecessary to the story, feeling forced and contrived, and clearly Blade didn't need lessons as the author mentions more than once that he can sound like a real Blue Blood if he wanted to. Just didn't make sense.  Also, the story itself was rather predictable.  But that's hard for an author to avoid, I suppose, and it didn't distract from my enjoyment of the book.
0765325950|1.0|Read that Jordan's wife wanted to \\"protect his memory\\" and help ensure that book went to top of best seller list as the reason for the ebook delay.  I would hope that one of Jordan's legacies would have been caring about his readers wishes more than some best seller list.  The book is going to the best seller list in either case but delaying the ebook release is a bad decision.  Wont be buying new at all.  I will pick up used or library just to make sure that the poor decision to delay the ebook release does not increase the book sales for best seller list purposes.  Terrible decision by Jordan's estate or the publisher.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Thjs was a very fun game. I enjoyed the challenge and the differnt ways the game went on differnt levels.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's so good!! Almost morbid and disgusting, but a true love story!! I could absolutely not put it down! Who knew that fighting for your life could end up as a beautiful love story! I'll admit, I teared up at the end when Katniss sang the song about the meadow that she sang to Rue in her first games. I love it,by far my favorite book!!!!!!:)
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I downloaded this movie and watched it on the new Kindle Fire that I got for Christmas.  The quality was awesome!  I had read the book previously, so the story line was familiar to me.  I loved the scenery, the acting.  I highly recommend this classic.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is fun. The graphics are nice and good quality. I enjoy earning coins and expanding my reserve. The only thing Is I wish there was a free way to earn more peanuts. Since you need them a lot.
0765325950|5.0|The wonderful ending to a wonderful series.  Sanderson builds up the climax to the point were you honestly can't see how the Light can win.  And in those moments of despair, everything changes.  I cried, I yelled out in excitement, and mourned.  Thank you for finishing the series, Brandon...it was worth the wait.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game keeps me up all night. I can't get enough of it. Some of the puzzles are really challenging, but for the most part you can breeze right through them.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|i saw this book got alot of negative stras but all im ganna say is this was my favorite one so far, if this isnt your faviorite  story then i guess you wont like this one, but if game of thrones or a song of ice and fire is your favorite book and you compare everything to it, you'll love this one
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Quick read. Interesting plot. Characters overly fictional and dramatic. Strong sexual themes.  Language/dialogue alternately fun / witty and cliche / sappy.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I have read all of Jo Nesbo's books so I had to read this. It's a bit different because Harry's not at home, he's in Australia. Story is quite good but Harry's behavior is getting a bit predictable.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Just getting used to my kindle, bought this by mistake. not my type of book. must learn how to cancel purchases,
B008220D5K|1.0|I mostly wish I could wipe this horrible movie from my memory.  It is not funny, the characters are not likeable, and it actually gets very mean-spirited a couple of times like when Debbie curses out a 13-year-old boy in a scene that does nothing to advance the movie, bringing the boy to tears and even mocking his physical appearance.  This leads to Debbie's husband, Pete, having a confrontation with the boy's mother, where Pete says some horrible stuff to the mother in front of the boy.  Finally all three parents end up in the Principal's Office, where Debbie and Pete both proceed to lie and say they have neither cursed out the boy or said bad things to his mother. The mother gets crazy in a scene that is so far over the top and so not funny.<br /><br />This is the worst movie I saw in 2012.  I never want to see any part of it again.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|I love music and I had no idea what I was missing out on until I bought this DAC totally worth it
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I had somewhat high hopes going in, but felt the movie was flat.  No likeable characters to really care about and the forced relationship they put the daughter in was unnecessary.  Clint basically repeats his performance from Grand Torino, which I really enjoyed, but it really is too strong for this setting.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|This album has more diversity of music than some of his earlier albums.  Also he has a few guests sit in with him, well worth a listen if you like Joe's playing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending was the best part of the whole series and I loved all the other books SUSAN COLLINS IS THE GREATEST
0765325950|5.0|For myself at least. I haven't been reading this series as long as some, but it's been part of my life for more than 10 years, and while it clearly would have been better if written by RJ himself, I feel that Sanderson handled all three books--and this one in particularly--capably, and even improved some elements (such as pacing).<br /><br />There are some loose ends I would have liked to have seen wrapped up, but that would have necessitated at least another book, and I'm happy with the finished product, very happy. I'm woman enough to admit I cried many, many times, and felt emotionally gutted at the deaths of characters I don't even like, because the story just draws me in so totally.<br /><br />I was particularly happy to *finally* get into Logain's head--yes we finally get POV from Logain!--and watch him find his way to the glory and power Min foresaw. He's hands down my favorite character (well, ok tied with Verin), and I feel satisfied with the way his thread was woven in the the pattern.<br /><br />It could have been better, sure, and some of the situations seemed a bit forced perhaps, but tying up such a massive series as this would have been difficult enough for RJ. For a man stepping into RJ's shoes, I think Sanderson did a great job, and I thank both men, and everyone else involved over the years in the creation of this series, because it has brought so much joy to my life, and inspires me to follow my dreams of writing and creating works others can enjoy too.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I don't usually rate games but this one was really good.  It has lots of games and a good story line. Well worth the money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book . I  meant to give it five stars. This was the best book of the trilogy by far .
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am a nurse and so what Dr. Alexander said was relevant. Yes I do believe in NDE and something hereafter.
B009329Y30|5.0|Nice movie with some  morals.  Except for the fornication that happens.  About time a soldier coming home gets something good.
B00280LYIC|4.0|So many ups and down  and so intense I just loved the adventure can't wait to read the next book

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book! The middle was the best part- this book tells<br />Of survival faith in God and courage. Great read!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Really good book that helps you understand a lot of the basic concepts. Nothing fancy just the fundamentals that are needed.
B00009MGGI|5.0|ian richardson is blood-chilling and the actress who plays his wife is even worse/better.  this is a look at the workings of politics the world around...fabulous.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|The shipping was fast, but, when the package arrived, the case was damaged with a hole punched through the back. The disc was in great condition but the packaging through me off because I like to keep my movies neat and pristine looking.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|I was really happy to have this copy of the movie. The DVD version I had was far shorter than the Blu-ray version. Actors were great and it gave me a deep appreciation for the ideals these men fought and died for.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I use this every night as white noise to fall asleep to. its really relaxing. my only question is: what on earth is the brown noise for??
0765325950|5.0|An excellent book.  Brandon Sanderson did the best he could to take up Robert Jordans mantle,<br />and I am glad to see the series make it to the end.<br /><br />And what an ending it is.<br /><br />Well worth it for any fan, even lapsed fans of the series should buy this book.<br /><br />It will be worth it!
B0061S073A|4.0|There are a few quirks about kids place, but overall it works as advertised. I like that it can lock the home button, and it can also start up on reboot.<br /><br />It is however not foolproof, and my son has broken out of it somehow more than once, so unsupervised use can be a problem.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Firefly is a fantastic series. This review is not about that. This review is about the absolutely terrible experience you will have with these Blurays. Not only are they slow to load but they don't remember your progress through episodes or allow you to access the disc menu while you are watching an episode. Seriously, there is no way to return to the menu without stopping playback. On a PS3 this forces you out of Bluray playback entirely and you must reload the disc, which is quite slow, to get back to the menu. Absurd. That there is no additional commentary and only a single 20 minute retrospective added to the Bluray beyond what came on the DVD set just adds insult to injury.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am captivated by this series of books. I have read them all at least 8 times. Cannot get enough....I wish Christian was a real person, cause I would so rock his world...LOL
0743243153|5.0|What a great awakening that many people believed that suffering was ment to be. In a way, the suffering is not a neccesary ingrient of growth.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|the game is awesome but I was in it so far but then it went back to the beginning it was fun
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Love this movie (of course it helps that I am in it right next to Gary Oldman). Video quality is excellent and I like that they kept the different format ratios so can alway see the full frame.
B009329Y30|3.0|Got this for my wife knowing it came with a digital copy, but it came with ultraviolet. Which required software or additional apps to play on the computer or iPad. Doesn't work as well. Movie is fine
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I liked the movie but it doesn't compare to the first Alien in story or shock factor. Quality is excellent in all the formats.
B001NHNG64|2.0|The story is slow, filled with descriptions of bullets, how they travel and the impact of each.  The story was predictable, so unlike his other cliff-hangers.  I would not recommend it unless you are doing a report on bullets and guns.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It works great<br />I am a woodworker it saves me a lot of time<br />I woud recomend it to anyone
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Super story, great writing, hard to put down.  Definitely recommend reading this one - and all his other books except for the 2nd one.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great app.  Better than the pc app. Mobilityware rocks w/ card games!  Ease in use, grest color + movement. Well worth it.
B0072HXVRS|2.0|I bought this for my daughter's 13th birthday.  She is having an Asian, \\"Year of the Dragon\\" birthday party.  She fell in love with it on Amazon while we were looking for party supplies.  I ordered it for her and had it sent 2 day shipping to get here in time for her party.  It just arrived and I'm VERY disappointed.  The paint job is nothing like what is shown in the picture above.  The colors are muted and washed out.  I would not have ordered this if I had seen it first.  In the dimensions above they say it is 3.4 x 5.9 x 7.1 inches.  Don't let the 7.1 fool you.  That is the height of the packaging not the toy.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|These are such cute and great movies!  I enjoy watching them as much as my two year old son does.  Would totally recommend to a friend!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this limited-edition series a lot; however, I do NOT APPRECIATE having to write a review to change my debit card info! NAUGHTY! NAUGHTY!
B001NN4162|5.0|this is a really cute and funny movie.  My two year old son asks to watch it all the time.  We can't wait for the sequel to come out!
B007XELMO4|5.0|Took this on a two week hiking trip to patagonia.  Everyone else had their SLR's in their bags and took time to get them out.  You know the hassle if you photograph while hiking - either drop the bag completely to pull it out of the main compartment or slide around the sling.  Thing of the past - I have a full DSLR and was shooting with a nikkor 18-300 - pretty heavy combination and the weight was handled easily.<br /><br />Couple notes:<br />- The review about the camera falling out - I have no idea how that happened - you control the angle at which the camera has to be turned to remove it.  The kit comes with a high-quality metal piece that screws into the tripod hole.  There is one angle the camera comes out - you can make it 90 degrees, 20 degrees - believe me you'll understand if you get it.<br /><br />- The piece they give you (to screw into the tripod hole) has a hole for the tripod - it's not ideal but it works fine.<br /><br />- The safety strap is garbage - toss it first thing.  You'll want to keep the neck strap and just loop it over your head like usual.  The difference is there is no tension.  If you need to take off your pack, however, you just let it hang like you always have done.  Easy.<br /><br />- The hand strap is garbage - toss it alongside the safety strap.  It's set up for some kind of alien hand ergonomics.  But it's free with the strapshot so whatever - if you like it.  Don't buy it separately.<br /><br />- Make sure your bag has a d-ring on the shoulder strap - you strap off of it and I wouldn't carry my camera without that security, even if you can rig it somehow without it.<br /><br />- The instructions suck - there are none.  They give you pictures and you figure it out.<br /><br />- The chest strap is key for support and stability - without it, your camera will roll around on your chest.<br /><br />But once it's up and running you'll be the envy of the hike - I'm telling you.  If you're used to stopping the entire group hike or taking five minutes to unpack, shoot and repack, get ready for some true ease of use.  I won't go on a photo hike without it again.

B002UM5BXW|3.0|I enjoy Bourdain's shows, and was hoping to enjoy this a little more. It's got some entertaining stories, interesting cooking and restaurant tips, but nothing spectacular.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's a good book. But a very slow read. I liked it just wish it moved at a faster pace.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I have always love this game and this is a good app. It is a little difficult to see how some of the tiles are stacked but it's a lot of fun.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|My granddaughter is a fan of all the Twilight Saga issues.  Through her and her comments, enthusiasm, I have learned what a genius we have in the author.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|It was a sweet story, unfortunately the plot was predictable and the book ultimately forgettable. I'm glad I bought a soft copy version as now I won't be faced with disposing of the hard copy of the book.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I gave this CD as a gift to my son and we together remember how great the Beatles were and still are.
B00ADQPA38|1.0|I loved Season 1 of American Horror Story and couldn't wait for Season 2. Unfortunately, Season 2 has been sickening and a big disappointment. Season 1 was clever, fresh and delicious fun with just the right mix of scare, weirdness and humor. It seemed effortless. In contrast, Season 2 feels overwrought, overly complicated and is over the top in moving from the supernatural scares in Season 1 to a plethora of brutal horrors and atrocities that extremely sick humans do to other humans. Examples include a serial killer who skins his female victims alive, a Nazi doctor who mutilates his \\"patients,\\" a serial killer who crucifies a priest, a man with \\"mommy issues\\" who drinks breast milk and a range of inhumane \\"treatments\\" utilized at the mental hospital where Season 2 takes place. Only two of the multiple plots are supernatural. The first involving aliens seems like one plot line too many and feels contrived. (Season 2 takes place in the 1960's when aliens were all the rage so let's include some aliens!) The second supernatural plot line involves demonic possession with a good nun gone bad. This plot line was interesting and was the best part of the season in addition to Jessica Lange's performance of Sister Jude. In fact, the Season 2 cast are great actors who deliver solid performances but the material they are given  seems to just be sick for sick's sake. For Season 3 I hope American Horror Story can get back to the elements that made it great in Season 1. I miss that show. Season 2 just left me ill and disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't think this type of book would be for me,but I couldn't put it down!! Can't wait to read the rest of the the series.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I heard this cd 2 years ago and i put off buying it cause my cousin played it so much it was stuck in my head so i just didn't buy it till now. It came quickly and in great condition.

B004R1Q296|5.0|Ms Tuchman combined a talent for story telling with being an excellent historian who researched an incredible variety of sources.  I would recommend it heartily to anyone who loves Europe and wants to understand how we got to the world we are living in today.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book starts off with a impulsive wedding in Vegas and then changes from the predictable outcome to a bit of a difference with the groom at least wanting to make it work.  There are a few too many ups and downs before the happy ending, but it was ok for some light entertainment.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|My relationship with Tim started with 4-Hour Body. I enjoy the way he writes. I enjoy his stories. His books have been nice collections of things I've found interesting. Will I cook all of the recipes in this book? No. Will I endeavor on a hunting expedition in the near future? Probably not. I will, however, continue to reference this book anytime I need to kickstart my brain. If 4HB was a guide to hacking your body. This serves as a guide to hacking your mind.
0765325950|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but in light of the poor overall rating this book has garnered due to disappointment on the part of Kindle users, I feel I need to give it the rating it deserves.<br /><br />What can I say?  I've been reading and re-reading this series for seventeen years, since I was ten, and when Mr. Jordan passed away, faced the horrible thought that I would never know just how it all ended.  Then Mrs. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson stepped up, and to my surprise, the series, if anything, improved.  I can't describe the welter of feelings I had reading this.  Joy, anger, sadness...Now I feel vaguely hollow; not because the book wasn't everything I expected--it was--but because I can't believe that I'll never read any new adventures of the characters I've grown to love so much.  Mr. Jordan and now Mr. Sanderson have created an amazing world, and this last book is a fitting end to it.  Read this series.  Read this book.  You won't regret it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I enjoyed this story immensely.  There were a few parts that upset me and I wanted to smack the characters but it all worked out!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great entertainment and suspense factor. Loved the different perspectives and storylines that Nicholas Sparks has been mastering now for over a decade. His books will never get old.
1857988132|4.0|Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter.  Working for the San Francisco Police Department, his job is to seek out renegade androids and \\"retire\\" them.  After one of his superiors is injured by an android, Deckard is given the task of retiring six Nexus-6 type androids.  But Nexus-6 androids are clever and can be tough to distinguish from actual Human beings.  And so, Deckard gets thrust into a job where not everything is as clear-cut as he thought it was going to be, and it may wind up costing him his life...<br /><br />Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? reminded me quite a bit of the old Star Trek:  The Next Generation episode The Measure of a Man, where there is a dispute between Star Fleet and the android Data.  Is Data a sentient entity capable of making his own decisions, or mere property and able to be ordered about as such?  Many of these themes of sentience, free will, and self-determination also show up in this novel.  I would like to have seen these arguments fleshed out a bit more.  Despite the fact that Dick goes to great lengths to explain that the androids in this story are very near Human, the androids themselves seemed stifled by their own perceived inhumanity.  Are they more than the sum of their parts, or not?  Dick seemed to toss this question about throughout this book, but doesn't seem to come to much of an answer.<br /><br />Nonetheless, one can't help but feel sorry for many of the android characters in the novel.  They couldn't control being an android (any more than Humans can help being flesh and blood), but all they seemed to want to do was live lives that allowed them to experience life.  This is where Dick's story was most successful.  Dick made it evident, that despite flaws, androids dream too.

B008602KQI|4.0|I have read all three books.  The movie was ok but the books were better.  I like the movie but there were things that the movie left out that will continue in the other books so that is why it wasn't given 5 stars.
B007704HO6|5.0|Comment from one recipient: I am really writing to say I have read \\"BOB\\" in one sitting.  Couldn't put it down. an excellent read.<br />Agree with friend's comment, hence me buying 3 copies to gift for Christmas. I've also downloaded as an ebook, to read it again.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I a big Blu-ray disc buyer and when the complete seasons come out they be about 50-60 bucks. I've followed the graphic novels for years and when AMC picked up the series I know it was going to be a must own. Waited for about a year and a half and now I own it for 22 buck saving a lot of money and now two seasons of DVR space. I'll buy Season Three when it's under $25 to.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This was given as a gift and all I know is that the movie was watched and all who view enjoyed it.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I purchased the ebook edition of To Sell is Human and read it on my Kindle, which of course meant that it was quite easy to lose track of just where I was in the book. Lo and behold the book ended long before I was ready for it to! I wanted more! Like Mr. Pink's previous books, this one is a bargain when you consider the value of the content against the purchase price. His style is conversational and his passion for the subject evident. I will be rereading this one soon in order to better absorb the content and apply the lessons to my work as an introverted freelance entertainer who struggles to make those brutal but necessary sales calls.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone (and according to Daniel Pink that's everyone) who is required to move others.

Also, be sure to check to see if Røde is offering any deals for getting this microphone.

B0019NB9A2|5.0|The first sci-fi movie I've seen with my dad in Theater.<br />In Europe was never been released in DVD, and now I can have it in Blue-ray!<br />Amazing!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Do yourself a favor, and refresh yourself on Bourne Ultimatum. This story takes place somewhat parallel to that story.<br /><br />In saying that, I found the setup of the movie quite long in the wilderness. The middle also drags a little relating to the pharmaceuticals story. The end has a great chase scene though that makes up for some of the moments that drag a little.<br /><br />OK, so this review is rather vague, but I don't want to give too much away in terms of the story. Check it out as a cheaper rental or once it hits the Prime 'free' streaming.
B000056HE9|5.0|....and I've not been able to find DVDs of it before. The quality of the image is certainly not HD but is as good as I've ever seen broadcast on TV so it's fine for my needs.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|First of all, I'd like to say I was obsessed with this trilogy and while reading the first two books, I felt like I could never get enough of them. As many other readers, I had high expectations for the big finale that were crushed by the author.<br />***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br />1. The first noticeable difference in the book is the rhythm. Unlike the other ones, in which each page would bring a new twist to keep you interested, Mockingjay is slow and full of endless descriptions concerning the rebel's preparation for the war. There's a long time gap between one important event and the next.<br />2.The characters. Mrs. Collins dedicated so much time to war, weapons, training and technology, that the interaction among characters that we were exposed to previously went missing. Instead, new minor characters were brought in and out without a reason. But the major mistake was practically erasing Peeta from the story and then bringing a VERSION OF HIM back, a Peeta completely transformed by the Capitol. Why? What was the point? To go all dark? I assume yes, because Katniss doesn't know how to shine without him. The book itself doesn't shine without him. He would've brought some light to that heavy sad dark environment we were locked in for the most part of the book. We get it; it a story about war, death and how to fight a Government that doesn't work to overcome the necessities of its people, but that's no reason to make it so hopeless. Not to mention what happened to Finnick. When we finally get to understand him, love him, when he can finally have Annie forever with him, Mrs. Collins decides that MUTTS should take his life away and that all the others should just let it go, accept it easily, including Annie. REALLY?! I know Mockingjay is not a fairy tale, but wasn't going through all the torture the Capitol put them through enough? I was chocked and disappointed when I read that page. Could used the same words to comment Prim's death. And what to say about Gale? For no reason I can explain, he was always making Katniss angry. Was that the only way to give poor Peeta some room in Katniss thoughts? Sad. Also, I believe I'm not alone when I say we should have had more of President Snow, a more complex dialogue about the whole situation of Panem (including the reason why the Hunger Gamaes still exist) so that we could have the chance to see the story through his eyes too.<br />3. Last, but far from being the least of my disappointments in this book, the finale. It's been two days I finished reading it and I still cannot believe that was the end. It felt like the author didn't have much time to finish the story , so she just came up with some cheap way to give it an ending. First, after the war is over, Gale goes to District 2, finds a job and stays there like  nothing ever happened before. Is that how BEST FRIENDS vanish from each other's life? No attempt to fight for what he claimed  he wanted the whole book or even to help Katniss with her new internal fears? That doesn't sound like Gale. That sounds more like a reason to make Peeta the only option available for Katniss to choose. Yes, \\"choose\\", not \\"fall in love with\\", but choose. After all Peeta did for her, after proving how much he truly loves her, that's what he gets: A girl who had no other option given the circumstances. Because I didn't buy that \\"REAL\\". That broke my heart, specially because I wanted Peeta to make her love him. We understand that the war changes people, and it wasn't supposed to be different with Katniss, but what I don't understand is the lack of development of this possible \\"love\\" she suddenly admits to feel, since there was more evidence that she loved Gale in Mockingjay (which I hated).<br /><br />Well, I guess that's all I can think of for now. Regardless the third book, I like the series in general and hope that the producers of the third movie take the time to give the Hunger Games trilogy the closure it deserves.<br />REAL OR NOT REAL? ;-)
B008HTQ28K|2.0|Not great really for John Grisham, I often thought reading his books that they were a bit overdone on the details and all I wanted was a good stroy but this was just a story and not a great one at that. I had it figured out almost from the start. It's ok if you want a light read while in bed recovering from the flu.

B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Mostly ridiculous and completely predictable but if you just want to watch something silly and meaningless this one is for you
0316228532|5.0|Forget about Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling has reinvented herself as a Dickensian writer with a social conscience in her timely first adult novel,The Casual Vacancy. It is so good it left me in tears. It even has a 'Tiny Tim' and an updated ghost who, unlike the one in A Christmas Carol, can hack into a website.<br />The question posed is, Who can fill the council seat vacated by the shocking natural death of 44-year-old Barry Fairbrother in the idyllic parish of Pagford,<br />UK? He was a good man of humble beginnings, genuinely loved and missed. With him gone, First Citizen (Mayor) Howard Mollinson, puffed up and elderly,has won! No one else has the power to defeat him on zoning and tax issues. Rowling invents 22 true-to-life, aptly named townspeople, injects humour and entices the reader into an increasingly less lighthearted labyrinth of follies, foul-ups and interrelationships. Teen-agers can't stand their parents and grownups fail to understand their kids.<br />No one heads in a good direction and finally tragedy strikes with few pages left to go. Yet, masterful storyteller that she is, Rowling deftly uses the shock to have some of the characters mend their lives and make a better future possible.<br />[...]

B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, that's why I tried sticking with it.  But the reality was that I was bored by the characters and the storyline.  And fell asleep half way in.
B00A757EFW|5.0|brings back memories of my younger days. my first video game was the atari and pac man was the best!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A wonderful book that kept me reading until 4AM and I didn't want to stop.  I love the main character's wittiness and resourcefulness.  If only NASA could operate like this today we'd be much farther along.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is a little hard to manuever for me but my 4 year old loves it. So does my 9 year old.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|It is amazing that someone could fall so far and come back.  It was definitely the work of our Lord
B0086700CM|5.0|got this game on my iphone, children loved it, so we put it on all their gadgets IPod, and Nabi
B0060D0XE4|4.0|I watched this movie with my 7-year-old son and found it to be entertaining and gripping throughout. I would have given it a five star rating if there weren't so much person-to-person violence.  If you are sensitive about this type of violence, you may not want to watch this film.  If it doesn't worry you, you'll likely enjoy this storyline which includes both some predictable and unpredictable twists.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Steamy content but not raunchy combined with a great love story - I loved it. . . . . .
B004G606K8|5.0|First book I bought for my kindle, great read all the way through! Can't wait to start the next one!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|getting too big. Annoyed by people u don't want to hear from.to difficult to use anymore. Can' t find help I need
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This book is still residing in my Kindle waiting for me to read it. I just have to finish my other reading projects.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Easy, breezy, cozy...the way a mystery should be. I like Lexy and her grandmother, what an adorable relationship! A handsome love interest, baked goods, and a murder, makes for a quick afternoon read!
0684824906|4.0|This book is still resting on the shelf nearby waiting for me to read it. I just have to finish my other reading projects first
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|5 stars. This movie kept me on edge. Wasn't disappointed. I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|I love the Sting and now on Blu-Ray both the movie and the score are better than ever. From the Joplinesque music to the Newman Redford action, this is GREAT!
B009OXS8RQ|4.0|Fine set of songs. If they aren't up to Video Games or Blue Jeans they are better than some of the filler on Born to Die in my opinion.<br /><br />My issue is with the vinyl edition I purchased. Side 2 has a lot of background noise...noisy groovz. Too bad. Otherwise the album comes with a nice lyric sheet.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|Definitely not happy with purchase. Poor quality, material,is cheap. Not easy to fix if there is a leak. Not happy at all
B001KQZ7I8|4.0|Francl seeks to demonstrate that, contrary to our natural inclinations, man finds true meaning in life by not focusing on self.  While it is my personal belief that this is especially true in relationship to God, Francl demonstrates that it applies not only to the spiritual, but to every aspect of living.  Even in the unimaginable conditions common in the German concentration camps of world war II,  people survived by focusing on the needs of others or doing some greater good.  Fascinating and thoughtful reading.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Nice hidden object game with decent storyline.  Would be nice to have a hint button. However I made it to the end without it. Game is fairly easy with a couple spots I struggled a bit with.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ I HIGHLY CONSIDER THIS BOOK TO ANYONE IN DA WORLD
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was thinking a large font calculator was needed for the kindle fire and then here it is!  I downloaded another calculator last year but it was hard to use just because it was so small. It looks like a desk model calculator sitting on the desk.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I wanted to catch up on the Diwton Abby series before the new series came on. This series is a keeper!
B005LAII8A|5.0|The movie is very well-acted, written and directed. At first you think its simple for Joe to kill Old Joe; wrong as the movie progresses the story gets more complex. With some great action scenes and dialogue and an outstanding breakthrough performance for a certain little kid, you'll see what I'm talking when you watch the movie. Arguably it was one of the best movies of 2012 so do yourself a favor and buy it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this game to my new KINDLE FIRE HD. I have really enjoyed the game so far. The color really pops out from the Fire HD which makes for a colorful gaming experience. As you move through higher game levels, the number of colors used in the level increases so playing on the Fire HD makes the color distinction quick and easy. That is not to say you can discern the colors on other tablets/phones, etc. It's just say on the Fire HD, the colors are crystal clear for added enjoyment. The game is easy to play at the lower levels and gets increasingly harder as you move up to higher levels. Not many instructions but you soon figure out that as you play each game in each level you will receive a check mark or a star upon completing the game. A check mark in the game number square means you finished the particular game your were playing but a star in the game number square means you finished it in the lowest number of moves possible. Therefore, stars are better than check marks. You can play the game on a timed basis but I prefer playing the game without using the timer. This game can be addictive if you are the competitive type and an hour will zoom by quickly. Give it a try. And it is free!!!
0765325950|1.0|I don't understand how a newly released book in this day and age would not be available on kindle. Shame on the publisher!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|best game ever !!!!!!!!!!! install know !!!!! so so so so so so so fun !!! I like the game install and see if you have fun on it
1574216988|2.0|I bought this as a gift for someone and i thought it was going to be more instructive, longer, and just.... more.  But it isn't.  It's really thin, a lot of advertisements and other projects.  I was not impressed.  Also, not beginner.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book and wish Enzo was a real dog or human for that matter.<br />I actually miss the character and will read this book again.  I've told all my friends about it.
0765325950|5.0|I have been a fan of the Wheel of Time series sense the 90's.  Every time a new book would be coming out, I would read the books i already had over again.  After Mr. Jordan passed away, before the finish of the series, I was crushed.  When I had heard a few months later that Mr. Sanderson would be finishing the series, I was torn.  After reading a couple of Mr. Sanderson's books, I found that while not the same writer that Mr. Jordan is, you can see the influence his writing style has on Mr. Sanderson.  I became excited when the release dates of the next 3 books.  With the date of A Memory of Light to be Jan 8, I started reading the series again in October, 2012.  I finished this read threw on December 27.  When I got my copy of A Memory of light on January 8, 2013 I dove right in.  I have spent the last 2 nights with about 6 hours of sleep, reading as soon as I get home from work, and during my lunch hour.<br />I have finished reading the book today, and as Thom would say, I can even find the right words to describe how I am feeling.  Parts of the story made me laugh, and one part of the story with a horse that has been a small side story sense the first pages of the series almost brought me to tears.  Major things happen that were shocking to me, and other fit right in line with the prophesies, and visions that other books have fed us all along.  One chapter, &#34;The Last Battle&#34; has a ton of pages, probably close to 200, and I was reading so fast I had to stop myself and read them again.  Simply amazing things are going on!!<br /><br />For all of the people giving this a one star, you should be ashamed.  You are upset that you can not get the electronic version of this book on the day you can get the hard copy.  That is no reason to give it a 1 star.  The BOOK is amazing.  It is not the BOOK's fault that you are upset you can't read something that isn't on a gadget.  You are even giving it a review when the label is &#34;HARDCOVER&#34;<br /><br />Once the ebook comes out, I hope you do not hold your grudges about this book, and still take the time to read it.<br /><br />If you have read the first 13 books, you will want to see how the story ends!
B00015YVD6|4.0|I bought this because I liked the movie and I hoped it might be kid friendly enough for watching with little girls who love mermaids. NOT lol. When a movie starts off with the main guy's brother dropping coins so he can look up women's skirts ...that tells you right there it isn't not for children lol. Even when they hopped right into bed after a few hours seemed so silly. As an adult I laughed but sighed too. So wanted to show the mermaid stuff to my girls. Oh well. I still got a great movie I can watch while I clean. :) The behind the making of the movie was awesome too.
B0001I55OC|4.0|After reading all the reviews, I thought that it would suck worse than Gigli.  Or any other Paul Walker movie.  And while Walker's acting is still atrocious, in this film it is at least 2 notches ABOVE Keanu Reaves.  The sets, special effects, and especially the costumes were fantastic.<br /><br />Timeline is probably my favorite Crichton novel, and this movie did change some things but IMO nothing crucial.  Every movie adaptation has to take some shortcuts somewhere.  (Except for those interminal LOTR movies; those things left in EVERY bit of boring detail from the books, as far as I can tell).<br /><br />Basically, what I'm saying is that if you like the book, you should give the movie a try!
0307951529|3.0|It's a good book, really inspirational at times, but not very helpful for giving you ideas to set you off on your own.  Mostly just success stories of what others have done.
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|Entertaining movie. With a title named Premium Rush, expect some cheesy moments, but overall I enjoyed it and would watch it again. Lots of car chases and action.
B001O2MBMI|5.0|Beautiful songs, beautiful voice, beautiful artist.<br />All together becomes a dream of how music has to be.<br />When you listen to her singing, you know,<br />that she got soul.<br /><br />Friendly greetings from Germany. She`s got<br />many Fans in my country.
B0013V3GN8|5.0|this was great, i really enjoyed this documentary, however elvis on tour is done slightly better if you are a big fan check it out. however i really did enjoy this on elvis' birthday was very enjoyable!
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|Great performance at t 10th anniversary concert. The music is awesome as always. And to have the whole musical to listen to is great.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I loved all 3 books. Couldn't put them down. Never really wanted any of them to end. Kept wanting more
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Love this musical! The actors in the movie cast aren't exactly singers but this soundtrack still evokes the feeling and power that a good Les Mis soundtrack should!
B009ANP48G|5.0|was better than I thought it would be.  liked the dance scenes better; acting could have improve but since I'm not an actress I will give the stars on the movie a thumbs up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|t it shows more than a reviled calculator it can also say words like hello hole and other words. like sweres. and other stuff
B004HW7JMY|5.0|was surprised; it was good and gory and exciting; a lot of killing which is the best part; i enjoyed it.
B000068G5F|5.0|I knew it was going to be good, but I heard Californication on vinyl first and I was sure there was no way it could live up to that.  Well, I was wrong.  Now I couldn't possibly pick between the two.
B005544V6A|4.0|The show was generally enjoyable and acting done well.  The script was a little too glib for my taste.  But all in all I enjoyed it.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you are a fan of the show family guy you will like this movie. It had some crass humor but we thought it was pretty funny, but if you like family guy you would like the humor. A little on the childish side but overall pretty amusing. I think my favorite part was when they were partying with the actor who played Flash Gordon.<br />  If there was a rating between &#34;I like it&#34; and &#34;I love it&#34; I would go with &#34;I really liked it&#34;.<br />  Not an appropriate movie for young kids but fun for the adults.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies ever! The audio and video are without flaw and I am so pleased to have it downloaded. The movie itself is a nerdy love of mine thanks to the fact that I grew up a Trekkie, but this movie is a must see even if you're not as nerdy as me!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so so so just like a circus!!!! cant wait to see how much drops next time LOL so excited about it
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I am personally a big fan of Enya and I very much appreciate the fact that I could buy this collection for my KindleFireHD. All of the songs are beautiful and relaxing and I simply enjoy being able to listen to such beautiful songs when I have no stereo or CD player. And I can even read at the same time! Wonderful!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We are hooked! Couldn't stop watching until the tapes ended.  Then passed it on to friends for them to enjoy.  Others are waiting!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|While I still have yet to play all of the songs, I've found the songs I've been playing to be enjoyable and very much in the Holiday spirit. I love the challenge and the fact that if you're paying attention, this game will definitely teach you how to play your very favorite Christmas songs! Very nice!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is just lovely. It is more than just romance, it is about love. Love that you feel for your family, friends, and for THE ONE you love.<br />I've read at least 7 romances on the last month and I can't not love Slammed.<br />As much I couldn't stop reading it, I couldn't stop myself from crying something, and laughing.<br />I loved it so much that I am buying Point of Retreat right now.
0307388921|5.0|This book was a great read.  Far better than the movie.  Another one of those Chuck books that's impossible to put down.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Game is wonderful. The only problem I am having is adding friends. Some people can send me gems but I can't see them on my friends list to send gems back.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Does exactly what it should. Hold my camera steady. This is a durable product with everything as expected. I like the legs on bottom so you can set camera down as well.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I'm already a big Mitch Albom fan. I've read several of his books, including The Five People You Meet In Heaven; which is one of my all time favorite books. He has a nice way of building relatable charactors in a short time and delivering a message that's uplifting without being too preachy.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love the game just wish you didn't have to pay for bucks or to get more energy when it runs out if not for that I would give 5stars all the way
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|Another great album, and even better because it was recorded in a garage with old equipment.  If you like the sound of the Foo Fighters, then you will not be disapointed in this album.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|What else can I say? There's something new I pick up everytime I listen to this album.<br /><br />The record plays seamlessly on my new Audio Technica LP60 turntable.
B008G12ERC|4.0|A little on the lighter/mellow side than some of their previous albums, but overall it's a good listen.  The case on my album was a bit broken on the inside and outside, I hope it was from shipping, but it still should of been in better shape.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|Most of the funny scenes were the ones they showed on the trailer, after that it was just a lot of fluff. Cohen's Borat movie was the best by a mile, it's hard to come even close to topping that one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to admit when I started, I had to get used to the writing style because it is all done in first person and it is done in a bit different style. But as you get going in it, you really get engrossed with it.<br /><br /> I think most people will love the twists and turns of this book as I did. There were many surprises in the plot that is hard to see coming.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this book if you enjoy a good mystery.
B0095R76EW|2.0|Midwest in the winter ugh! It felt it took me five years to watch it. Too bad they were a nice cast.
B009O07NDY|5.0|My dughter fell in love with the music from this new movie and this soundtrack made her very happy at Christmas time.
B008UJDOOC|4.0|for my nephew he's 14...hard to buy for...but I listened..no bad words so it was safe there music sounded ok...nephew said he liked the group...
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It won't let me update the new York update I want it it is so ducking gay in a break my kindle
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I thought this book can teach everyone a lesson to not judge a book by its cover. I thought this book wouldn't be that good but it was one of the best books I've ever read.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Great mystery, scif-fi, time travel, adventure, this book had it all.  It's a great vacation read, or something to take on a trip.
B00003CXMG|4.0|A fun movie and light hearted break from reality.  Good music included throughout the flick and puts you in a better mood than before you turned it on.
B00AE2I4WK|2.0|fun dancing.  terrible acting.  oh well.  we thought it'd be better with all the hype.  best character was the mia michaels from so you think you can dance.
6304698623|4.0|A good hearted movie about love, loss, and the challenges that we may encounter along the way.  A very worthwhile watch.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I've puchased this sorting board as a gift for a one or two-year-old several times.  Plan toys are some of the best designed, most eco-friendly, and most well made learning toys out there, and this one is no exception.  Very solid multi-tasking toy that should last through several kids, if not generations.  The toy is rated for 24+ months, but is going to be given to a one-year-old on his birthday.  The pieces are large enough to be safe for a one-year-old, and I think he'll be placing the pieces on the pegs long before he reaches 24 months.  Will update this review if I hear more details.  Great to be able to find toys like this on Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was present at the opening of this gift to the one-year-old recipient.  He spent a lot of time handling the pieces (chewing on them, inserting his fingers in the holes, banging them together, etc.) and was able to place the circle pieces on the pegs almost immediately.  He had to compete for custody of the pieces with the two three-year-olds who were present.  The littlest three-year-old, who had some trouble matching all the pieces to the \\"correct\\" pegs, was the most intrigued and returned to this toy over and over again.  It seemed to be challenging to her without being at all frustrating.  Watching the three of them use this board in so many different ways, fight over it, and return to it again and again, convinced me this was an excellent gift choice.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a great book to read!  So many different emotions, so much love and hate!  I fell in love with it!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I think Gillian Flynn is a great suspense writer. I've really enjoyed both of her books and looking forward to seeing more from her in the future!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|As a woman who enjoys working with flowers and finds much pleasure in studying them, I'm in love with this novel.  As much as it tears my heart apart at times, I found myself sitting in Elizabeth's kitchen, listening to the silence of her sadness and grieving with her.  My heart was put together again, meeting Hazel.  Love and life, entangled hopelessly like the vines in a vineyard left to wander, alone.
B0086700CM|5.0|a fun game that my kids and I all enjoy.<br />very easy to learn and you can never get enough playing time!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I feel God chose Dr. Alexander as a messenger of hope and inspiration for all of mankind in a modern world filled with despair and materialism. We must all realize that this life on earth is merely a proving ground for what is yet to come.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I feel the author was promoting under age drinking and I mean stupid under age drinking, like lets do 16 shots at a time and try and make it look glamorous.  The story was okay, not something I would read again, or suggest my friends ever read.
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|My wife and iI were disgusted by this movie.  We like Matthew as an actor and thought it might be an interesting change to chick flicks but the content was repulsive. I wished we would have read the review or plot before.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was very well written and I really enjoyed this book. I have told several of my friends about it.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Perfect movie, perfect price, perfect shipping. Twister is my favorite movie of all time, so it would be a sin to give it anything lower than 5 stars.
1400069181|5.0|If following the lessons in this book change the lives of more people than it disadvantages then it is a plus. I for one was inspired by it and will follow many of the lessons in my future business ventures.
B006G2124E|4.0|The dvd skipped in one spot, but overall quality good.  Felt the service was speedy and still comfortable with the product even with the minor glitch.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|\\"Jack Reacher\\" is a very good fun action movie!.....I liked the acting...the characters...and the action!...If i had never seen Tom cruise in a movie...and went to see this one...I would want to watch all his other movies,too..Robert Duvall...Werner Herzog....put in fine appearances in this movie,too...I really enjoyed the action scenes...the fights and car chase scenes..stand out as being some of the best i have seen in a movie in a long time..The audience ...loved this movie...at the theater i was in..Go see this film and decide for yourself..I don't go out to view many movies in theaters anymore...I'm glad i went to see \\"Jack Reacher\\"...
0743517849|5.0|It is always helpful to have the audio of a book for me because I can listen while I work.  Helpful for my personal financial education.
B004DM0UII|1.0|This is the only internet streaming application I've ever used on PC or Android that the music is distorted and full of static like I have no radio signal. I can't find any radio stations I've ever heard of, and with over 100 apps on my phone this is the only one that I cannot figure out how to close, it remains paused in the background, task manager won't even kill it?
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you are looking for great craft ideas and you aren't a crafty person, this is the place. There is everthing from ridiculously easy to extremely difficult ideas. Same with food! I'm not very artistic but I have found many cute ideas and things that I know I can do! I have a lot of fun exploring!
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I love love love these books. There was drama in all the right places, fights and makeups right where I wanted them, twists and turns I didn't expect but that felt exactly right. And an actual arc that follows the characters as they grew! With an actual good ending at the very end!<br /><br />This series is a rare jewel, and I can't wait for more.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Foul but bunny.  One of the only movies recently that had me laughing for a large portion of it. Actuallyl managed to hold a decent storlyline also.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story and great characters.  Could not stop thinking about Wool when I wasn't reading it, and didn't want to put it down.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading this story of survival and triumph for the human soul. Yann really did a great job of letting you get to know Pi and making you root for his survival.  The book is serious but it also has some funny and sage prose.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Playing for hours at a time.  Can't seem to stop.  Even just glance at the TV when it's on.  NOT a 5 star review but rather a 6 if that's even possible.  This game is downright ADDICTIVE.
B008BM9L72|5.0|great read<br />every women and man should read<br />liked the way ;kept you hanging on every paragraph  had to put down
B009JZVT70|5.0|Very fun to watch...Great story line....A twist on every story you have ever watched or read...Very Good Character set up.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I loaded it for my 7 year old Grandaughter who loved it! She was excited about how many levels she conqured.
B001JFZ118|5.0|By far, Christopher Lambert excels in his portrayal of Connor McCleod!  The storyline is unforgettable making you want to learn more about his world.  Excellent movie!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The storyline was good.  Although it was a little predictable the story took  some really interesting turns before it ended..
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I purchased this app to stream video from the PC to the Kindle Fire.  Video playback is unwatchable inside my LAN.  Did not try outside my network.  Uninstalled from both machines.  Waste of money.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I thought this movie was amazing! It had a lot of action, plenty of story line, and kept true to the Halo franchise. The actors were perfectly played, and the only thing I could say about this movie is that I hope there is another one soon.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I thought this book was well written and informative.  This book really made me think about what makes a healthy diet and why I continue to gain weight on the USDA recommendations.  I wish the author included a little more information about the diet recommendations in the back of the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A book you don't want to put down. Not predictable as you think it's going to be. You might even want to read it again after you finish to have a new experience and different perspective.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|been using for a year. when playing words with friends my contacts were GONE.  Sick of trying. sent email --no help yet.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|How much easier could they possibly make it to order something from Amazon.  Turn on &#34;one-click&#34; ordering, and buying stuff is as simple as clicking on a link.  Done!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is a very funny movie one of the best in the series one of my personal favorites the bluray DVD looks better than the regular DVD this movie you watch all year round buy it on amazon you won't be sorry
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was hesitant when I started reading.  I couldn't figure out where the story line was going, but it didn't take long and I was hooked.  Wow!!  More, More, More from Ms. Hoover.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|Good book and can show you some techniques, but it can be very opinionated of what the author prefers as far as taste goes.  Some of the repeated recommendations for seasonings etc are just recommended so often on personal preference, not everyone will have the same opinion on what tastes good.  Worth getting and following along to learn some cool little tricks and how to be efficient in the kitchen.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Enjoy playing as long as I can. Then I have to wait to build up energy. Good fun on a slow day.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|If you read  &#34;Kid Lawyer&#34; you may have expect this book to be a continuation - but it takes a completely different turn.
B00979CS50|5.0|Psychedelic Pill is just one of those Neil Young albums you know it's great. There's no explaining really, it's about feeling. The eight songs that grace the album are all done in an effortless, laid-back way reminiscent of the younger days of Crazy Horse around 1969-1970.<br /><br />It's actually a feat in itself for Neil and the boys to have drifted back so naturally, at times it feels like you're listening to Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere but it's just a feeling which doesn't necessarily mean it's sounds like a copy or something. They've just managed to succeed in getting the music to sound right and free flowing - some songs are quite long for untrained ears but they are great just like that.<br /><br />Lyric wise, Neil sings about different topics - from his concerns over the quality of music nowadays (the way it sounds) to his debt to Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone to lost hippie ideals and so on.<br /><br />Summing up, a great release overall. My only issue is with the size of lyrics printed on the booklet, which are far too small for the human eye.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was as exciting as the first. It's riveting plot has me starving to read the finale. I can't wait to see how everything plays out.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love to play the game.  When waiting on something this is a great way to pass time and be entertained.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Sound Quality is excellent for gaming, the battery lasts 9.5+ hours, and the range is easily 40 feet. Comfortable and easy to set up.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is a great movie.  Watched in on my kindle and was very impressed with the amazon marketplace.<br /><br />If you are a star trek fan and have not seen this movie do so now
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game.  .it is my favorite game. .it was the very first thing I downloaded. .I hope y'all enjoy it as much as I do . .

B0066W1AZK|5.0|I like to play chess, although I'm not very good at it, and what I like about this particular chess app is that it is very user friendly. Over all I am satisfied with the product and hope to hone my chess skills with the help of this app.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Loved it.  Could not put it down!  It had me totally engulfed and I cannot wait to start the next one!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book a lot because it gave me a realistic view of what cancer patients really feel like. I loved the romance between Augustus and Hazel. I would recommend this book to all teenage girls.
142313494X|5.0|I put 5 stars because I like movies. And I think of  Times I did stuff in the movie. Love kallie
B008KP2VZY|5.0|This is a very nice tool to have in your app drawer.  The user interface is clean, well designed, and easy to use intuitively.<br /><br />Using this app has rather made my phone the center of my files and documents &quot;universe&quot; and is actually helping me get a bit more organized.  Most of the apps I've tried seem to make things more of a pain instead of less.  Nice work, and thanks for your efforts.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's just like the version on my laptop. It's great. I play it everyday on my break and when I bored. It's a good he to help pass the time.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I couldn't watch the movie after the poop sceen. Just too stupid. I know people are saying this is comic genius but I tried watching 3 times and hated it more each time. There are far better movies by ANY of the poeple involved in this move. Sorry Ted lovers- this movie was too dumb for me.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|If you like to play pinball and don't care about playing multiple boards then it is fine.  If you want more than three different boards to play though you must pay.  I like it but it might get old.
B004DM0UII|4.0|It's a great radio app. It's much like slacked or Pandora but without the limited skips, periodic redundant ads, and the &quot;are you still listening?&quot; pause that makes you mad every time. Does it request a lot in order to run? Yeah, it does! I could care less, it's a freaking radio! Not like it's going to spam me with Bob and tom stuff or try to hack my bank account to fund am radio stations. I would 5 star this bad boy but I can't. There are many stations that are not at all what they are described as or named after. Beach tunes: George straight, Kenny Cheseny, Jimmy buffet? Nope! It's the who and other classic rock bands. All in all its pretty darn good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I had no idea I would love this game so much.  I practically become obsessed with getting to the next level.  Love it!  Can get annoying though when you get to a hard to complete board but I like the challenge.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I have a nine year old daughter and this game keeps her busy for hours-she loves this game I think it is fun as well
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun to play once you get the hang of it.  A great way to waste a little time.  It worked great as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I Loved it! Was a great story, loved the suspense. Nick is a great author. Have loved all his books.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Story moved right along.  Interesting characters.  A little put off by the &#34;Deus ex Machina&#34; appearance of Karen Delfuenso at the end, but it was explained well.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent read. up to the usual standard of the Reacher Series
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|Great method, but it takes alot of practice and determination to change the way you think so that you use the strategies in the book.
B0054U58AS|5.0|Excellent book.  The authors Provide Great Insights.  Entrepreneurs or policy makers can learn from these insights.  Read it if you are one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you are not the century Fox news and it is the world of to be the game is to try to be able the century and a few years ago when I enjoy the century and it is a great job on this one that has the world and is a very small number and it is the result is that it will not the world is a few years ago I had.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Interesting biography about a great distance runner.  A good read for runners and any athlete who enjoys pushing their own limits.  Addresses the mental aspect of sport and touches on good nutritional ideas.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Full of suspense, charm, and even wit. And what can be said about Cary Grant and Grace Kelly? Worth every moment spent watching it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this love story very much. The twists in the story were brilliant. I did feel it was a bit too melodramatic for my taste at some point, too sentimental, but then again, the topics were pretty heavy so... (Will not give away spoilers) :) Great read!
B00003CXCD|5.0|Beautiful fantasy about a princess who escapes her controlled life. Anything with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn are always worth watching.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|A proselytizer once asked me why I didn't believe in god. I replied that there was no proof. His rejoinder was: \\"Believe, and the proof will come.\\" But that's just it: Believers don't require proof.  Faith is supposed to be blind and unquestioning. So, for whom does this book constitute proof of heaven? Those who don't require it? For skeptics, this is just one person's predisposition to believe turning to actual belief as a result of a hallucination.<br /><br />The author is suggesting the existence of a mind that is completely unconnected to a brain, and he's pinning his hopes on future research that will prove him right and change mankind forever. His \\"proof\\" is essentially based on our very incomplete knowledge of the connection between the mind and the brain.  And he buttresses his argument with our even more incomplete knowledge of quantum physics.  Way to go, Doctor.
B00871C09S|5.0|Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are terrific in this suspenseful thriller. And look for Aaron Burr as the heavy in this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a very hard time putting this book down. It is one of the best written books I have read in many years.  I read a review saying they didn't like the ending, they thought the author didn't know how to end it, and just stopped.  I think she left it open for another book, or to just keep you thinking what will happen next.  Overall a great book.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|You can hardly catch your breath when something else happens. Cary Grant is, as usual, wonderful in this role of mistaken identity.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|The movie makes absolutely no sense and creates numerous paradoxes one after the other. The paradoxes created rule out the existence of the main character on more than one occasion. Don't waste your money.
B003VANOFY|5.0|To begin, these are five stars because nothing is perfect.  I am not an audiophile, so I may be wrong, but I think these sound great.  Pros -7.1 surround sound. - Over ear design blocks out a great deal of sound.  These are not noise cancelling or isolating. - Wireless can reach all the way out to my car (30+ ft) - There is a volume scroll wheel and macro buttons on the headset. - The Logitech software is highly functional with some fun voice options. -  My friends say I sound great. - Adjustable head band.  I feel comfortable wearing them for hours.  Con - I had an issue where they disconnected frequently.  Seems to have been better since I plugged the adapter directly into the computer instead of the base. - Bass could be better. - Sometimes ear cup get messed up by my glasses.  Overall I would highly recommend.  Update: 2015-04-01 Still using these as my primary headphones for gaming and chatting.  Battery is strong and everything is still working and in great shape.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it has all the games I like. I wonder if they would create a new version of this game.
0765325950|1.0|Well, I started this whole series on a lark, read -ALL- of them to date via Kindle.<br /><br />On a whole, I found the action very well written, and a large part of the handling of men in general annoying / borderline insulting.<br /><br />To my mind it did get better with the new author (my sympathies on the death of Jordan), men weren't quite as muddle headed, women weren't always pulling on their ponytails or thinking that they were the only ones that knew how to run the world.<br /><br />The last book?<br /><br />I really just want to read it for completeness, ending a chapter in my life / reading.<br /><br />Hoping it will be good.<br /><br />On Kindle, well, if you're going to gouge your audience on pricing and plan on a goodly portion of your profit coming from kindle sales, it's really a poor business model that doesn't have it out for 3 months after the book becomes available.<br /><br />For those who claim \\"well, you can't judge a book by it's lack of Kindle...\\", I have to say the whole thing is one package / user experience and to me this is just major fail.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is wonderful.  As soon as you open it you get the current conditions.  Love the extended forecast and hour by hour forecasting.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|As a huge Harry Potter fan, I like this collection because I got it for a really good price. I used to have all the individual movies on DVD, but they were all stolen when we had a break-in. I wanted to replace them but not spend a fortune on all the individual movies again. This did the trick. It is not fancy, they do not come in their own little movie sleeves on anything. If you are looking for the movies but not for the frills, this is a good buy!
140053271X|5.0|I had some issues first learning it, but now I love my NOOK!! I am very happy with this purchase.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I love this album. I love every single song on it. It is beautiful and raw. I would highly recommend it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I stared out with Gone Girl. Read it in 2 days. Then I searched to see what else she had wrote. I read Dark Places second, again read it in 2 days. Sharp Objects was my favorite. Very dark, dirty, and twisted. My favorite kind of books to read
B0000AM6IY|5.0|i love this movie and i love all the choreography in it. if you are a dancer you could definately learn a lot of great moves from this movie.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was a page Turner. Loved how it bounced around from past and present and from the multiple characters stories. What a great read
B000V8A95C|5.0|Just went to see the musical, and needed to get the album to hear all the great songs again.  They really grow on you!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I could hardly stand to put it down.  Quite the page turner!  Thank you Suzanne.
B000001EUR|5.0|The CD contains original, must-have recordings such as Bad Boys Running Wild, Rock You Like a Hurricane, Coming Home, Big City nights, & Still Loving You. Scorpions fans can buy with confidence! Thanks, Mary
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was an interesting read, but the ending is not what I expected.  I'm a happy ending kind of gal.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I have so far enjoyed this music very much and again it was a very easy and quick process to dowload and pay for this music once I downloaded it to my cell phone.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|With my daughter's encouragement I started reading this series of books. The keep your interest. I laugh, and stay on the edge of my seat to see what will happen to Stephanie next. Can it wait to read the next book.
0393327655|4.0|I love this guy *but* ... it does get tiring having constantly to change his male references to female or neutral the whole way through a book. He refers to people as 'men' and uses male pronouns throughout. In the 21st century. Not good enough.<br /><br />And he's far better onscreen. Youtube him.<br /><br />I don't agree with Sam Harris on one point. I'm pretty sure the super-rich manipulate religion to control the masses, keep us fighting amongst ourselves whilst they hoard the Earth's wealth. If the super-rich thought it would benefit them to dismantle Islamic fundamentalism, they'd have the resources to do so.<br /><br />Natasha Holme<br />Author of [[ASIN:B007NZRQAC Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder]]
B000QFW7UA|5.0|Does it comes with the deleted scenes? I know there are a few scenes with an octopus and many others. Anyone?
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I am a great fan of this show, of a woman who fought great odds to become a doctor in those times. There is adventure suspense, romance, and caters to all ages as you watch this family come together through all sorts of trials and fun times. Jane Seymour and Joe Lando did a great job in the lead roles but the supporting roles were also great. Would recommend to everyone it's a great family show, and to have the whole series for the price is a gem. Order it now you wont be sorry.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|My all time favorite movie.  I love this movie.  John and Olivia are my all time favorite people who can actually act.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is my favorite game of all time! I've gone through the whole game once already and I am almost through my second time. I got it for free but I would gladly pay money for it now that I know how much fun it is! The graphics are fantastic and the colors are beautiful. Try it! You'll be glad you did.
0756405890|5.0|How to describe this book. It was amazing. I don't mean it was a good book because honestly it wasn't. The plot barely went anywhere, some of the characters were shallowly developed and so many other things that are necessary make a book technically good were missing but I LOVED it. Absolutely LOVED it. To me that's what matters. I WANTED to keep reading. Even when I realized I was going to get to the end without a completed story I didn't care. I wanted to keep reading the story. To see where it went. More than once my heart raced and I feared for Kvothe. Not that he would die. It is a trilogy. I feared for Kvothe, that his story would never be happy. I wanted HIM to get the answers to his questions about the Chandrian and the Name of the wind as much as I wanted the answers for myself. Oh how I wanted the Name of the wind from the first moment Ben calls it. It may be safe to safe that is what kept me reading more than anything else. What is the Name of the wind?! Occasionally I wanted to strangle him and Denna and all the minor characters that surrounded him but that just made the story more real to me. I felt his arrogance and fear. I pitied him and was angered by him. Kvothe was a real person to me as I read. I cannot describe this book except to say wow and rank it among my favorite books
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I have a garage office I had to give up due to poor wireless connectivity (about 75 feet to the wireless connection point thru 2 brick walls 3 Sheetrock walls).  I decided to reopen my garage office and searched for a range extender.  Reviews pointed to the AWUS036H but further research indicated that the AWUS036NHR was better for a Mac running mountain lion.  So I made the purchase despite mixed reviews on the later model.  It arrived today and I installed it on 2 different macs.  One using the enclosed cd for 10.7 and the other by downloading the driver from their website.  Simple install and reboot. And both worked.  I only used one USB to connect despite it coming with two (had no choice because my pro is a retina and only has one USB on each side).  I went from 30% to 95/100%.  I have only used it one day but am satisfied.  I did purchase the upgraded antenna but haven't used it as my connection is fine.
B00365EVWE|4.0|I like the sound of these earphones.  Nothing really blows me away about them.  They can get a little muddy on the high end.  When listening at a louder volume, the simblance is quite noticeable.  They are not as loud as some other earphones I have.  I have to put the volume higher to get the same kind of output. For everyday earphones they will do.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Bought for my teenage daughter and she loved it. The price was much better than it was in the stores.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Grabbed this when I noticed that the author is Andy Weir - who once upon a time wrote two of my favorite web comics (Casey & Andy and Cheshire Crossing).<br /><br />This is a quick and gripping read, and surprisingly well written. There is a lot about this that feels like an old-school science fiction story, with a focus on speculation based in some sort of actual basis of science.<br /><br />Liberties have been taken here and there about the conditions of Mars but nothing that took me out of the story.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I plead with you to read the negative comments on this book.  There will be two common sentiments.  One, what sort of campaign was able to generate so many 5 star reviews?  Two, nothing happens!  Granted, the first book was intriguing, however a little predictable, even enjoyable, as it was so short. That and the multiple 5 star reviews prompted me to buy the series.  Big mistake.  I didn't even get through the second book.  I got about 100 pages through it and can sum it up here.<br /><br />Characters walk down a lot of stairs, then talk to 2 people, then begin walking back upstairs.  That was 100 pages.  Nothing happens.<br /><br />There is no conflict, no subplots with different struggles, just page after page of mundane descriptions of everyday actions.  You don't need to tell me for 3 pages what the stairs are like and another 15 pages about how tiring it is.  We have all walked up and down stairs!<br /><br />I understand almost every book can hit a point here and there where it looses the reader to details that the author goes on about, but it is usually brief and is leading up to something the reader wants to see resolution to.  When you give the reader no hope of a payoff, you lose them.  Definitely did for me.  I found myself just skimming pages after giving up at 100 pages or so looking for something other than people walking.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, save some money, have a friend describe their drive into work for 100 pages, and I can guarantee it will be more entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are not words for how incredible this book is. I was sucked in from the beginning, every emotion the characters felt, I did too. I can't even count how many times I smiled, laughed & cried along with the characters or the last book that made me feel this way.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil the story by revealing any bits & pieces of the content, I'm just going to leave it as one of the best books I have EVER read and encourage you to read it, too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me on my toes. I always wanted to read more and now I wish I hadn't quite finished it yet.
B004S5FWEC|5.0|Started reading cannot put it down had to burn the midnight oil finished in record time,the whole book was exciting from start to finish
0765325950|1.0|What else is there to say? Not happy at all!! I feel that my being a digital customer and fan is not important.  Wake up and smell the roses.  Is this the digital age or are we still living in the dark ages.  What a waste of my time. I may just read the book at the library and not give these clowns any more money!
B009A9BF5G|2.0|pense que estaria mejor .me imagine otra cosa , espero que los que vengas de luego esten mucho mejor, gracias
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Mr. Flynn's books and he continues to give me a read that I can't put down until I am finished.  I look forward to his next book!  I like all of his characters.  Clifford A. Mitts III
B005LAIIPS|2.0|Too much action, not much story.  Poor linkage to the past.  Mediocre at best.  Misss Matt Damon who personified the role.  Without Damon, should stop trying to stretch the series.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was a great easy read! The whole time you're reading all these questions are going through your head keeping you interested the whole time! If you're a fan of the hunger games you'll like this book!
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Good, because Harry Hole novels have been really good reading, but the series is turning dark.  His latest, &#34;The Phantom&#34; is the darkest of all.  I am worried for Harry.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|absolutely loved this game!  it really kept me on my toes and interested to the point ididnt want to stop!
160094048X|4.0|I am not vegan, but my daughter is.  Both of us have this book and have made some of the cookies.  They have become favorites.  Anyone would enjoy the recipes in this book.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Terrible  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh  i could barley understand what the whole point is you cant understand it and why have a dictoniary on your kindle when the make millions in the world!!!!!!
B004EWFV9K|4.0|I loved this book, but was so sorry to see the series end.  I had great affection for the troubled Kurt Wallander.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I don't think I can live without this one.  I like being able to pick which of my songs will wake me up.  There is a great selection of ringtones if you don't want to use your own music.  And honestly, first thing in the morning I usually can't do the harder level math problems without getting up and out of bed!
0307269981|5.0|I am so sorry Stieg Larsson is not here to write more novels.  The Trilogy about a gutsy girl and a nosy reporter are so good.  I found them fascinating and was never bored at any time reading them.  Warning:  they are gruesome though.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Love Calvin Harris, I only wanted four songs but at $5 I couldn't pass it up. Excellent beats, easy listening, great for all moods.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|My 5 yr old daughter loves this movie. It's about fairies and a little girl-just like her! She makes a whole journal about fairies which modeled for us to make our own! More like this please.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I took my niece to see this movie in theater and she walked out sing the little songs. I knew I had to get this when I seen it on sail it's just as fun now as it was in theater.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Greatly restricts your ability to search for items.<br />Very good to monitor items you are bidding on.<br />Would like to be able to shop more.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Right now I'm loving how Robert Downey Jr. can do no wrong right now. I love his arrogance and cockyness it makes the movie. It just as good as the first one and if you loved that one than this one won't disappoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fun read.  I gave it five stars because the story is very dynamic and has several different levels to it.  I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys adventure and fair off imaginary world's.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I got this for my nieces tablet she just got herself a new kindle fire and this was the first game I downloaded for her and she just loves it. I've downloaded other games but she keeps going back to this one.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This show and it characters are amazing. I was very entertained and my sides hurt because Sheldon is some kind of wack-a-do. Seriously if you want a show just to get out of your blue mood this one will start the process.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I have already seen the movie so I knew that when it went on sell that I would surly get it. It rocks with good action, a good story hook, and an awesome revenge plot.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|There was so much I had forgotten from the theater. If you haven't seen it since then see it again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addicting, i cant stop playing it unless i run out of coins. i gotta say, i like it alot.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I am terrible in math and having this at my disposal without having to search for a calculator is a life saver in my line of work.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great Harry Potter Collection movies, it was brand new had all 8 movies and it arrived just in time. I'm really happy with my purchase.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am not a big reader, in fact the only books I really have read are Harry potter 1-4, Chronicles of Narnia, and of course The Hunger Games.  For my new years resolution, I decided to try reading as many books as I could (I didn't want to set a limit for myself or a unreachable target).  I am very happy that I decided to start with this book!  I fell in love with the characters, the two main characters have such great personalities!  It was very well written!  I look forward to reading more of Green's works in the future!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Good game. Quite fun however I wish there were a bit more to do. My two year old likes to play with me. Very easy since everything is tap activated.
0545265355|5.0|I burned through all three books in about a week!  It is easy to get lost in Katniss' world and when I was finished with the books I wanted more.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I hope this is the first of yet another great series from David Baldacci.  It was outstanding, a real page-turner from Chapter One to the end... Can't wait for Robie's next \\"assignment\\"!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final tale in this trilogy gives the closure and ending of a true heroine and two people despite all odds stacked against them survive for one another
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The production and concept of the movie was great, however I feel like they missed an opportunity to really make something special.
1451648537|5.0|Good. (One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen.)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|No surprise on this application. I have the comparible application on my Windows Phone and the functionality between the two is identical. The ease of use is also &#34;very similar&#34;<br />Very impressed with the quality of the application.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|As an adult male I don't get it, but who cares --- my daughter loves it :-)  And everyone she shows it to, boy or girl, loves it.  A couple weeks later, she's still playing it, taking photos of the hairstyles she has created, etc.  Crazy fun.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Great protective case and even bettern price!  You cannot go one with this one!  Clips in easy and works as it designed.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I'm really not judging too hard on this movie. I enjoy action movies, cop movies, thrillers, etc. I also have not read the book.<br /><br />However, one major complaint is that this movie should have been rated R. For such a tough character as Reacher is and the dark-ish plot, an R rating would have been much more interesing. The sniper in the beginning isn't as effectively portrayed without the \\"pink mist\\" which is even mentioned later on in the movie. No, I'm not obsessed with violence and gore, I just feel that it would have been more effective considering the movie is about a sniper. Just my opinion.<br /><br />I think Tom Cruise, as crazy as he is in real life, plays a decent Jack Reacher. Again, I don't know the book but he's pretty good for what I do know. I just mean as a character, it was fun. Tom Cruise, like him or not, can definitely pull off a lot of his characters very well. (Mission Impossible, Valkyrie) Some people simply dislike him, but they're often considering his personal life.<br /><br />Some things are stupid. Jack never uses a gun, really, unless he has to. I mean, he should get his ass beat eventually. I understand it's a character trait, but there is a stupid point where he has a gun pointed at an enemy much larger than him but tosses it aside to brawl.<br />There is a scene where two goons basically beat each other up instead of him by accident. Funny-ish, but dumb.<br /><br />The story is intriguing. I never read the book, so it was all new to me. I don't know what's been changed, but Reacher's realizations about the conspiracy are interesting to me, and you say \\"Damn, I should have noticed.\\" They're not too far-fetched, which is nice.<br /><br />The best part about the movie is the audio. Some people may say this is the worst part. Very little music, some ambient bass. The movie feels real, not clouded by \\"epic\\" music. Everything takes place in a realistic setting and I feel like it's more \\"authentic\\" if you will.<br /><br />For example,there is a car chase. My favorite scene in the entire movie. No music, just muscle cars racing through streets with cops. Some may say it's boring and generic. I find it real and authentic. No crazy jumps or maneuvers. Just speed and wit. It's almost worth watching for this scene. It's amazing. The classic cars in the movie help, too. Besides the newer Crown Vics the police drive, Reacher grabs a Chevelle SS and I saw some classic Mustangs and Camros (I believe, even if only for a second).<br /><br />Unexpectedly, I found plenty of humor throughout this novel. Not bursting on the floor laughing humor, but clever, witty humor that fits perfectly into the story and makes the movie just that much better. Without it, it's close to a generic \\"badass\\" movie, but instead becomes clever.<br /><br />All in all, decent movie. I'm going to read the book now because I enjoyed it. Maybe it'll be better, I don't know. But I'm interested. As for a sequel, I wouldn't count on it. I know the books are separate stories and this one takes place later in the timeline, so I don't think many of these characters would end up returning in a sequel. In Hollywood, it's tough to do such a thing- except James Bond, but that still has some recurring characters- considering that only one character is important.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|The first Kate Morton book I have read, but i will seek out more. I class it as LitFic along with the likes of Jodi Piccoult. The story is an intriguing story with a number of twists, ranging from South East Queensland to Suffolk and London during the Blitz. The characters across three generations are well formed and described. The plot kept me &#34;turning the pages&#34;  till early in the morning.  Loved it..
0345803485|5.0|My daughter requested this book for Christmas. She read the whole thing within a couple days. Said she didnt want to put it down. Will be ordering next book in the series soon!!
B005P06AAO|5.0|Is it possible?  Am I actually recommending a show that airs on MTV?  I AM.  But I will preface all else by saying that it's scripted - it's not reality - and Matty, one of the characters, is shirtless as much as possible.  Is that kind of pointless?  Maybe, but he's pretty good-looking so who are we to complain, really?  Also it's still a high school show so there's not supposed to be a lot of depth.  Boys without shirts are always something good to add to the equation.<br /><br />The series follows Jenna's mishaps through high school and while some of them are super ridiculous - the first episode is a prime example - a lot of them are totally relatable.  She has a friend with insanely strict parents, a friend with awful taste in guys and has no clue when to leave well enough alone, parents that seem great but don't always get it and, of course, that one boy.<br /><br />Who would I be to review something without talking to you about the love story?  We're in season two right now and Jenna's involved in a monstrous love triangle between Jake and Matty.  I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who have yet to watch, but it's seriously ridiculous.  I'm positive that this show is the only one that I watch live every single week no matter what.  I tweet with my friends while I watch it and I rewatch the episodes obsessively.  All because of this love story.  Pathetic?  Maybe a little but at this point I'm past the point of caring.  All I care about is resolution.  TEAM MATTY ALL THE WAY.<br /><br />Now I know a lot of you are like, \\"Why the hell would I watch another teen dramady?\\"  Because it has spunk.  And it's one of only two teen shows that I watch.  So you should watch it!  Just try one episode.  I bet you'll like it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|took forever to download but it was well worth it. And it was worth the $2.99. I played the easy version and it was easy...but still fun. Highly recommend this game if you like a game with a storyline, mini hidden object games and good graphics.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This album could have been s*** and I still would have given it five stars.  Thank god it's not, right?  It's amazing.  Mumford and Sons is by far my favorite band and has been since their debut album came out almost three years ago.  I've seen them live twice in the past year alone (they don't come to my neck of the woods often so I'm pretty proud of myself) so I've actually heard about half of this album already but live versions and studio versions are so very different.  That said, this album more than delivered.  It captured the intensity that I saw in concert while maintaining the raw-ness that has always been a Mumford staple.  Everything about the band is great, but it's the combination of Marcus' vocals along with the choice of instruments in each song that makes each song and performance so perfect.  Not to compare them to other artists, but there is no autotune or other nonsense and you can definitely tell.  It makes them sound more real.  It makes their songs sound more real, the emotions sound more real.  It makes the connections more real.  It's perfect.<br /><br />Comparing Babel to Sigh No More isn't easy because the band has grown so much in so many ways (front man Marcus Mumford is married to Oscar-nominated actress Carey Mulligan now!) but sound wise, the core is still there.  I will say that Babel is slightly more mellow than Sigh No More, however.  As a self-proclaimed lover of up-beat songs, I was a tad disappointed that there weren't more songs that had some get up to them.  But seriously, only a tad, because the songs that do get you out of your seat really do.  The big three would have to be \\"Babel,\\" \\"I Will Wait\\" and \\"Lover of the Light\\" - there's a reason \\"I Will Wait\\" was chosen as the first single after all.  And \\"Babel\\" is also the lead song on the album and the title track so it has a lot to live up to and it definitely does.  It includes a wide array of instruments and uses Winston on the banjo really well.  Plus the chorus makes you want to dance.  \\"Lover of the Light\\" has been around for a while and while the live version is slightly more up-beat, this one still has some gas with a heavy drum and bass line.  It's definitely not one to overlook just because you might have heard it before.<br /><br />Now my favorite?  Well that's easy.  \\"Below My Feet\\" is by far my favorite track on the album.  I loved it when it was still just a live song that they performed and I had no idea if it would ever see a recording studio.  Hearing a polished version of it with real audio makes me love it even more.  Keep the earth below my feet / For all my sweat, my blood runs weak / Let me learn from where I have been / Keep my eyes to serve / My hands to learn.  LOVE.  IT.  Not to mention there's some electric guitar in there - not the norm for every Mumford track - that gives it a little edge.  It's a beautiful song that I've just been dying over for months and now that it's on the album, I can't stop listening to it.  Truly.  I can't put into words how much I adore it.<br /><br />While the entire album it stellar and I don't want to point out other songs and leave out others, I must mention these next few - it's almost obligatory.  When I saw them in concert a month ago in Bristol, TN/VA and they performed \\"Ghosts That We Knew\\" it was almost a religious experience.  The entire audience got quiet and swayed and sang along.  It wasn't like the acoustic \\"Timshel.\\"  This was different.  The lyrics hit home just a little bit more.  I can't explain it really, but you should definitely put it on your radar.  \\"Lovers' Eyes\\" is also wonderful and something they've been performing for over a year.  And I must point out that they first performed \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" for the first time when I saw them last year in Raleigh, NC.  I felt pretty special.<br /><br />Anyway, I felt like I was bragging for half this post talking about seeing them live but seriously...it influenced my opinion of the album a lot.  Even if I hadn't seen them, however, this album would still be the love of my life.  I can't imagine myself listening to anything else in the near future.ld still be the love of my life.  I can't imagine myself listening to anything else in the near future.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought this book would all be lovey dovey but then all of a sudden it takes you on a journey that is completely engulfing and makes emotions run through you like no other book I've read. Highly recommend.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game and is a wonderful change up from normal board games. It is fun and easy to understand.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This was a perfect chipset for me.  It is incredibly fast and goes great with my new gaming build.  It is very fast and offers great overclocking speed and would highly recommend this to anyone in the price range. It gets great FPS overall on all the newest games (as of late 2012/ early 2013).<br /><br />That being said, the standard cooling fan that comes with it is bad.  I would suggest an upgrade immediately, with even a small upgrade, my fan never exceeds about 125 even under intensive gaming load.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a must have for anyone wanting to improve their network performance. It showed me that my wifi signal was overlapping my neighbors causing problems. I changed my broadcast channel and increased reliability.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|Great phone cover.  Semi bulky, but for a butterfingers, this is a great product.  Also comes with a plastic screen cover (make sure you clean the screen and keep the plastic cover clean while installing, mine had dog hair on it).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for an Otterbox, it is slightly bulky, but still fits nicely in a tight jean pocket and keeps your phone very safe.

1401937519|5.0|Very interesting account of her near death experience.  I have read hundreds of these accounts and found hers to be unusual...in the way she described heaven and the beiefs she returned with.  Her account was wonderful, but some may not agree with her conclusions, but again it was an unusual account.
B00514HDNW|4.0|This is the first Matheson book I`ve read. Nothing like  the films I`ve seen based on it. Good read. Short but sweet.
B00867GHS8|5.0|For starters I'm incredibly bias here, this movie is one of my Favorites as far as Disney goes. Bluray takes the movie to the next level as far as detailed images and sound goes. It makes you appreciate the quality of the CG animation that DVD tends to hide. As for the 3D, its effective yet natural. It's not over driven, no pop outs, just depth and shape. Some scenes there's no effect at all. I'm a fan of 3D so I like it but some might just prefer the Bluray by itself. If you haven't seen this movie, take the time, it's one of their best.
0896898288|4.0|Shipping was prompt, and the book is in excellent condition.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my printer won't print the patterns out the correct size.  The book mentions the possibility of that happening, but it wasn't mentioned on the website.  I'm having to go to a friend's house to print.  It's definitely an inconvenience.  If the buyer has up-to-date equipment, it probably won't be a problem, but my HP 922 All in One printer won't do it.
B001E5CH0G|4.0|Yes its bluray quality, it was new and works fine in my players. The item looses a star because Im not sure I like this movie. Will Farrell is hot and cold for me. It questions the reality of xmas entirely too much to be a children's movie. I prefer to watch xmas movies with my kids so its hard to recommend as a film. Amazon did their job as usual I can't fault them at all.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love to be able to put document on my device.  I like to be able to view documents any where I am and as I need too.

0547564651|5.0|It's a great book for everyone who comes in contact with children and wishes to help them.  Mr. Tough spells out how to help children succeed but most importantly how to form a good character because this comes first and everything else hinges from it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I played temple run and its ok but this game its so addictive I change put is down that's how fun it is and I highly recommend it!!!!!!!
B004EPZ034|5.0|The kids I bought this for really liked it. Very good movie. Just the right age for the kids. Thank You.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Okay, so my titles not the best one! I know that. But at least it's true!!! Well, for me anyways...<br />But seriously. In my opinion, the beginning sucks. I found it hard to read and it seemed sloppily written. But I was determined to stick it out. ( mostly because I'd paid $6.99 for the thing...) But as I read, I was relieved to find that, yes. It did get better. I love The Hunger Games a lot, and would've probably cried if the finale was a total dud. At some points, this story makes you cry, and at others it makes you mad. (That's one of the things I love about Suzanne Collins, her ways of twisting your emotions...) but all in all, this book was amazing. You just have to get past the beginning...
B005DOKM9M|2.0|The sleeve is ok but not what I expected.  I would have rather had one that unzipped on three sides so I could keep my kindle in the sleeve while I use it.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This is sort of the first comic book I read. I have to say, this is really amazing. The characters were all so cool and strong I  their own way. I love how it tells a good story of not just the fall of superheroes, but the fall of great things in the U.S. I myself have been planning on drawing some characters and writing some lines after I read this. I wonder if there will ever be a sequel to this in the \\"unforseen\\" future.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|What a great series. Love, hate, betrayal, dedication, sex, history and everything between! I only wish the series had been continued.
B009T3AHDE|1.0|If you are interested in trading fifteen dollars and two hours of your life for two hours of complete boredom, this deal is now available to you via the purchase and subsequent viewing of the film in question. I can't even believe that this was directed by David Cronenberg, the guy who directed 'The Fly' (a significantly awesome 80's sci-fi flick). Making a film this awful and boring is an actual achievement. It is so bad that it literally almost deserves some kind of award, hence, the title of this review. I wish I read these reviews before purchasing this film on a whim during a visit to my local Best Buy. Now, go do what you will, but consider yourself warned.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|I have never finished the entire book but it is a great concept. I am hoping so,easy to finish it.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|A collection of columns that looks like an autobiography.  The first chapters that deal with her wild and raucous childhood are hilarious.  Later episodes left me cold.

B003WJQ74E|5.0|This is a book that stays with you--a great premise and well constructed...but it is hard to reread once you know what's coming.
1891252089|3.0|This particular yoga manual is best for those who are already very flexible, with some yoga knowledge. The book's spiral-bound format is extremely user-friendly, and it's filled to the brim with clear, helpful photographs and various one-page \\"full-flow\\" to \\"short-form\\" synopsis of various routines. I'm sadly no contortionist, but the kind of athletic person who is stiff and terribly inflexible. Currently, I'm severely laid-up with another ankle injury after two surgeries, in a support-boot for months. I desperately need basic yoga to regain and maintain muscle-strength, and become more limber, and will have to look elsewhere than this book. Author David Swenson is so advanced and limber that many these positions are far beyond the horizon for a stiff beginner.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This terrified me as a child, and still holds remarkable power to this day.  The collection of characters, the remote island, the charming rhyme that turns sinister...no one plots like Agatha Christie!
B000M341RI|5.0|I almost forgot how much fun this film is. The fantastic soundtrack, great crew of actors (good sports all), and Sheffield's scenery add up to a classic. I just wish the film were longer. At least this edition contains extensive extras, such as \\"Translating English to English,\\" but the \\"Focus on Sheffield\\" is disappointing - an art-house short, not a documentary. But when life gets you down, when the bills are too high, when you feel like something the dog forgot and the cat dragged in, or some other stress is seeping into your life, grab a great bottle of port or a fine dark ale and treat yourself to a goofy, lighthearted reprieve with \\"The Full Monty.\\" There is room for a sequel in those tiny sequined bits.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Love it!!! Have lots of fun with my friends playing back and forth. Never know what the dice has in store for you.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Intrigued by reviews that promised this was more than a period-fluff piece, I thought this might aid in getting through the travails of the holiday season. But the first scenes featured ballroom dancing and several heaving bosoms; I had to tell myself and the other resident curmudgeon to give the thing a chance. We were amply rewarded. This is so densely packed with excellent acting and writing that it seems longer than it is, in a good way! Richard Armitage is perfection as John Thorton, the dour proprietor of Marlborough Mills, and Daniela Denby-Ashe strikes a fine balance as self-righteous young Margaret Hale. Sinead Cusack is remarkable as John's demanding, indomitable mother, wary of Margaret's misguided judgements. Edinburgh is a splendid backdrop as the northern mill town Milton, where Margaret and her hapless parents are exiled to. The landscape of steep, coal-stained streets and ghost-ridden graveyards lend depth to the story. Brendan Coyle, magnificent in [[ASIN:B008FYZIVY Downton Abbey]], is superb here, as a poor mill-worker and union man. The social, economic strife of the industrial revolution and it's effects are deftly blended with romantic drama, where all the characters are forced to grow beyond their presumptions. Not wanting to miss a word, I found the subtitles quite helpful.
0765325950|5.0|First off I just read some of the one star reviews, not one about the book itself, just a bunch of whining about not getting an eBook, please give me a break, I can understand if you're in the military, they should get free copies of either the Book, eBook or Audiobook!  Its up to the publisher, I've seen many new releases that have no eBook at first plus books that have been out for years!!<br /><br />Just finished the book last night, didn't want to put it down.  It went back to the great writing that started the series.  No going on and on about the color and design of dresses, food, homes...  Nothing but pure story the give and take, all about the characters and the story.  Brandon Sanderson did a great job finishing the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome.You are challenged and you get to unlock stuff.Also it is very fun.The I don't like about it is that you need to unlock so many things.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game. Great animatoon and plot. I would buy the full version of this game!! I could play this game for hours and hours. I love all the G5 games.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I have always been  bad at naming songs or artist that I hear at various places daily.  This app works better than I thought it would and it's so easy to use.  Now I never have to ask other people the name of songs or artist performing them.

0765325950|1.0|Once again, like the evil in our own real world, it's all about money, money, money, money.  Who cares about the \\"little\\" people where all your money comes from.  We all will inevitably buy the book one way or another.  So frustrating and a major change of my perspective on Amazon and their morals and ideals.
B008PWUXQQ|2.0|I do like the the styling of these: very sleek, the thinness of the cover makes it easy to fold over and hold comfortably on the downside there's no padding so probably won't absorb much shock if dropped. The little grip feet design really does work on any surface and at any angle however the grippy feet also like to grip dust and cat hair making your cover look fuzzy on the sides. I like the holder design for the Kindle-you just slide it in and it stays nice and snug but the plastic piping on the holder is coming loose everywhere. The construction of these is what really gets me angry though: the stitching is done with some sort of plastic thread which feels scratchy and looks bad, when I hold the case against my palm longer than 15 mins the inside fabric &#34;bubbles&#34; like the heat from my hand loosens the glue or something [it goes back to normal after I stop using it], also the velcro strip is ripping right off the cover after two days!! I don't know who would pay full price for this.. I'm glad I got mine on sale.

I have the LG Optimus V, so as any LG Optimus V owner who's had the phone for 6 months or more will tell you, the thing is a piece of crap.<br /><br />Kindle for PC is awesome as well. So is the Kindle. But don't be surprised if nothing works on the LG Optimus V.<br /><br />I hate that thing.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|We all know this show is still very young and looking for its direction, but from the episodes so far we are looking at a great series about the Green Arrow!

(Sister as a party girl)<br />Knocking off the weekly bad guy from his list of names.<br /><br />This show is still very young, but from what I have seen, the future is going to be great.

B001JFZ118|5.0|While there were many others that followed, this is the orginial and I'm glad I have the Director's Cut..because it has many of the scenes that were left out. In some there would have been no difference, but in others, it will explain a few things. Christopher Lambert is great as McCloud and it should have been the only movie in this series. It answered just about all the questions you needed and although it did leave a few unanswered, so what...Not everything has to have an answer, it just is. And this is the way it should have ended. I never did like the sequel to it since it was so far away from the message and tried to answer questions that had never been asked or really needed. This about a man who has learned he is immortal in a time when sorcery, witchcraft and magic was as much a belief as was christianity....of course when he is struck down in battle and is near death, he is believed to be cursed and almost burned if not for a friend that helps him escape his clan.<br />He is still unsure what he is since he has never met anyone like him until Sean Connery comes into his life and Conner experiences his first &#34;Quickening&#34; which is what happens when 2 immortals meet.<br /><br />He finally learns to live with his 'curse', and his mentor teaches him how to fight, survive if necessary in a what is now going to be a fight for his immortal life because &#34;there can be only one&#34;. And nothing in this unknown history of immortals says they are all good..as in the life of all humans, there are those that are truely evil and will stop at nothing to be the one to recieve the final gift.<br /><br />Of course he has to leave those he loves behind because inevitably they will grow old and he will continue. His one true love died many years ago and he still honors her on her birthday as he promised. He is not cold, callaused or uncaring as his opponent  and tries hard not to interfere in the affairs of mortals. It is however impossible to do and although he has tried to keep himself free of relationships, it is hard for him to do,because although he is immortal, he is still very human with human feelings and emotions.  But he is the Highlandeer and the last...he is Conner McCloud and they should have left it at that.s tried to keep himself free of relationships, it is hard for him to do,because although he is immortal, he is still very human with human feelings and emotions.

B0052UYJDC|1.0|There wasn't anything new in here that I haven't heard before. She claims to be a minimalist, but her advice shows that she doesn't truly understand what the word means because she seems to have more &#34;stuff&#34; than even I do. This book was a waste of money and time.
B005LAII3A|5.0|Okay, anyone that was expecting an Arnold remake can just get it out of your head. The movie is based on Phillip K. Dick's novel &#34;WE CAN REMEMBER FOR YOU WHOLESALE&#34; so it will have some of the scenes in the first movie. But not all of them and Colin Farrell is great as Carl Quaid not Dennis as was AS. And with 2 very strong women co stars this movie kicks! Kate Beckensale is great as Quaid's wife and agent sent to keep an eye on him. And boy does she turn on the preformance taking the place of Michael Ironside's character and Sharon Stone rolling it into one. Jessica Biel is great as Melina and she is just as great as Kate Beckinsale. There is no other world plot, instead it stays on earth and follows the novel a bit more than the original movie. Although I've only recently seen a few of Colin Farrel's movies he is very verstital as an actor whether he is playing a ruthless vampire, helpless sexually harassed assistant or an agent that has no memory of who he. Very few actors have the ability to take such a variety of roles and be believeable. In this case, Farrell is very believable and his training comes back to him subconciously to keep him ahead of his pursuers. The action begins almost immediately and continues at a faster pace than AS's movie. Like I said, it is not Arnold's movie so don't look for too many similiarites although some have to be there in order to keep it as close to the Novel's plot as possible, look at it as a very different movie and enjoy the ride!

B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|I read this many times as a child and am enjoying it all over again.  Yes, the language is a little dated but the story is still touching and the book is filled with life lessons that still apply today.  Worth a read.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|With last episode had some issues with losing the stream.  I ad to re-connect with the stream.  This occurred however only one time.  Just never had this issue before.
0765325950|1.0|another 1 star review because of the uncontrollable greed of Tor/Harriet Jordan.  i've been reading a pirated copy of the ebook that's widely available on the internet and it's not that great of a book anyway.  series ended with a long whimper that started back around book 6 or so.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I have not experienced any issues with this product.  The stream is always strong and there haven't been any problems with it.  I would recommend to friends.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|A really good book,it keeps you thinking of the clues to what is going on and to what he is missing until he ties it all together in the end.
B003TH14H4|5.0|I have not experienced any issues with this product.  It was received timely.  The stream is always strong and I would recommend to friends.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this game. It's very addictive. Just wish it played better on my phone so I wouldn't have to fight my son for his kindle fire.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I have not experienced any problems with this product at all.  Have re-watched many times. I would recommend Amazon streaming to friends.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am still reading it due to the fact that it is time consuming.  I have to read carefully not to miss details.  Some of the book has been very good.  Other times I have found it boring.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book was really well written and the plot line was interesting but it was really predictable.  And the ending was kind of abrupt.  It was a decent book though if you don't have anything else to do one afternoon.
B005LAIHCW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. There were a couple really good moments that will most likely make you jump, the story was rather good with a couple nice twists towards the end. The casting and acting were spot on.<br /><br />If you are looking for a gore fest, you won't get that with this movie. There are some instances with blood, but there is very little and to be truthful I hardly even noticed that because I was so drawn into the story. It holds alot of suspense, and feels very much like a Hitchcock film.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent as is the audio. Overall there really isn't anything to complain about with this movie and I definitely recommend it, for rental or purchase!
B003VWW23M|5.0|Nothing else needs to be said.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the genre, GET IT.<br /><br />The review is now complete. Enjoy.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|entertaining, funny, and the mash ups of the songs were well done. everyone in the movie had a great voice
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Great DVD. I was watching and it just got better and better.  Jimmy and John Paul were spot on, and even though Robert sounds a little rusty at times, he sounded pretty darn good. Jason Bonham was so good.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|As short stories go, they were clever.  They are not about Detective Bosch.  I guessed the ending on one. I think it should be free or 99 cents for his work.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|What can I say.....Rod Stewart is one of the best...great album , lovely selection of songs and music .This is a great buy.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I am so addicted to NCIS in a totally bicoastal sort of way ... I love the DC branch and I love LA.  Great viewing pleasure with interesting story lines and a sometimes not so subtle jab at both sides of the aisle and the political machine.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Love this show.  The blueray shows the sets and costumes in stunning detail.  I would recommend this series to anyone.
B0053FANT0|5.0|I got it for a good price!!<br />It was just as described<br />It was what I knew that i wanted
0307474259|5.0|My husband read this book in January of 2012 and lost almost 90 pounds during the course of the year.  It works and Gary Tauber is a genius.  This way of eating can be done at home, on the road, at any restuarnt and is completely sustainable and easy to follow.
B000YHG72E|1.0|I don't know where this came from. I did not rent this video on Amazon but yet it shows up, and says I have a 48 hour rental but it gives me 5 days?
B0083DJWGO|4.0|This book gives a very good perspective after getting through the beginning which takes some doing.  Between reading this book and &#34;Ameritopia&#34; understanding how government runs makes much more sense.  Good job.
0765350386|5.0|...Cinderella thrown into the mix. Yes, that sounds utterly ridiculous, but that is the only way I can describe this superb novel. If you enjoy more than one of these stories, then you will love Mistborn: The Final Empire.<br /><br />Sanderson has created an ORIGINAL fantasy novel without the cliched wizards, dragons, orcs, and magical items of immense power they threaten to destroy the universe. If you want that sort of thing, then you can always read the D&D themed novels from Wizards of the Coast, or play World of Warcraft.<br /><br />This books follows the exploits of a female street thief named Vin, who joins a thieving crew led by a \\"gentleman thief\\" named Kelsier who kills noblemen and redistributes their wealth to those in need of it(the Robin Hood aspect of it). In fact, in the opening scene of the book, he does just that. His ultimate goal is organizing a rebellion to overthrow a tyrannical regime led by the fascist Lord Ruler (the Star Wars aspect of it).<br /><br />Kelsier is a Mistborn, a wizard that has the ability to manipulate metals (Magneto anyone?), manipulate emotions (Professor Xavier?), and increase speed and strength by burning certain metals. His crew also have various powers, which they will bring to bear in their struggle against the Final Empire.<br /><br />I highly suggest any fans of the fantasy genre to pick up the trilogy and read it. I promise you won't be able to put it down...<br /><br />Here's to hoping they make a film or a HBO series out of this someday...
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Just watch the trailer, all of the funny parts are in it. I knew this movie would be stupid but it was awful!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A truly wonderful, amazing, and inspiring love story! Thanks to a great friend for recommending  this book to me! Loved it.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|Great for kids of all ages. Even adults. Makes for lots of special times with grandkids on a rainy day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i like this game so much the more u play the more u have a feeling u went to do it
B001NE80P4|5.0|I chose this for my grand daughter for Christmas. She loves musicals and this could not be a better one for kids her age.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|The story hits home for me. The actress are hot and have great chemistry. I can't wait to see A Perfect Ending, by Nicole Conn.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|It seems to me that the more successful a writer becomes, the more susceptible they are to become very formula driven.  The last two books that Tom Clancy has written are even more so.  Perhaps they all have been but it took a while to notice.  While it was mildly entertaining, I found it quite predictable as a result of the predictable formula.<br /><br />I
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down; read it all in one night! Liked it so much, I downloaded all of her other books to my Kindle!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a super good book that you will not want to put down.I highly recommend it!!!  Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The show itself is awesome - I love everything about it. If you like the superhero kind of theme, then I am sure you will like this show as well.<br />As for Amazon's video on demand service - this was the first time I had purchased any kind of shows online. The streaming/download was perfect - I was able to watch the entire show without it &#34;buffering&#34; midway through. The picture (I purchased HD) was extremely clear. I loved being able to catch the first few episodes of this show since I missed recording them on my DVR when the show first aired. The cost is reasonable and much better than paying to go to a theater!
B00009TB5G|5.0|My boyfriend loves LOTR so I bought him this extended edition for Christmas- it came in amazing shape and of course he loves the features too!
1582701709|5.0|This book is a great read and very helpful for people who work in the counseling feild or for teens.
B001706I5I|5.0|great movie!  Always fun to watch the classics around this time of year and this just adds to the excitement!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is an awesome game! Great graphics, fun, fast-paced... the only problems I have are you get coins really slowly and it may mess up what you wanted to do. I have lost many times because of that. Otherwise, great game!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never fails.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  An exceptional love story and a story of perseverance and courage.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I rarely watch any thriller/horror type made for tv shows, but this series is definitely worth taking a look at.
B005LAII12|4.0|Good movie! Laughs the whole way threw! Then there were some serious parts that were good also. Very good graphic with Ted!
B005LAII80|5.0|I highly recommend purchasing this movie. Deserves the investment for a sequal. It isn't an \\"oscar\\" film but it should be a cult classic.
B006VJMZXY|5.0|I was delighted to find a Phillipa Gregory I hadn't yet read. I have been a fan since I read &#34;The Constant Princess&#34; five or six years ago. I love the way her style immerses you into the life of her characters and shows the female heros often forgotten by traditional historical novels. The story is made believable by so many well known facts powerfully woven into an interesting and thought provoking yet enjoyable story.
B000I0QL82|2.0|The DVD I got was in excellent condition, but it was Going My Way and Holiday Inn on the same disc. It was also the black and white, not the remastered color version, of the movie. I was hoping the &#34;Special Edition&#34; would be in color.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I recommend this program for your kindle fire...it keeps it from getting congested and is an excellent program to have.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|We got the DVD in excellent condition and about a week faster than the estimated shipping time in spite of the holiday season. I did notice that a scene was missing: the song Scrooge sings with his former fiancee was completely gone. Still, it was really special to me because my birthday is Christmas Eve and my family has celebrated by watching this movie every Christmas Eve since it came out.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong, is a game that makes you think a lot ..This version is a wonderful version...I love playing it and would recommend it to anyone!
859037985X|5.0|Programming in Lua is a great book to learn the ins and outs of the language. I'm learning lua for use in the Corona Sdk and being able to have this reference at hand is a must. Great writing style and I love that this new edition has exercises after each chapter. Keep up the good work!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|i chose this rating because this game is teaching me coordination as well as eye hand perception...i recommend it to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I'm faced with a situation that makes me wish I could \\"smack some jerk silly\\", whether it be a non-driver who cuts me off on my drive home, a smart-aleck store clerk, or yet another telephone money solicitor during dinner, I use Angry Birds to vent my frustration.  Instead of limiting guns to law abiding citizens who have almost been driven to violence, Angry Birds might be a harmless substitute.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I chose this game because of the anxiety I have at times and this helps take my mind off my troubles...because I have to think about what I am doing and it is a blast.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a great book, and it is easily understood.  It emphasizes reading food labels.  Wheat is, in some form, in nearly everything pre-cooked or pre-mixed.  Once I started eliminating wheat in my diet, the stubborn pounds began melting off.  You don't have to eliminate every tiny bit of wheat in your diet, just the major sources.  It may just be my personal metabolism, and I would suggest that anyone contemplating the elimination of wheat in their diet check it out with a physician first.  But it did work for me.  My skin cleared up, I had more energy and slept better, and as I stated, I lost weight.  I believe the wheat we eat today barely resembles the wheat our grandparents eat.  The farmers may get more bushels of wheat per acre today, but I believe that the chemicals used and the genetic engineering is affecting our health in a negative way.  My unscientific theory:  &#62; bushels of wheat per acre = &#62; # of people fed @ the cost of &#60; human & farm animal health.  And no, I don't work for or even know the author or publisher of this book.
B004YXE438|3.0|I chose this program because everyone said it was great...I love puzzles but when I went to open it ...it said I needed the expansion pack...so get the expansion pack too
B005DOKIYG|3.0|It does its job, but nothing else. There is no WOW! factor here. The sleeve is just that, and it fits tightly so you cannot add anything to it. Thus you need to carry a stylus separately as there is absolutely no way to get one into the sleeve.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The first book was good, the second book was great! But mockingjay is fantastically, amazingly epic! The whole story kept you at the edge, always guessing but your predictions could never come close and always surprised you in a way authors have seem to forgotten how to do. I read through the story with tears of fear for the characters that I've become attached to but by the end I was balling with tears of joy. READ IT!!!!!!!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I do maintenance work, so am able to listen to music, throughout the day.  This is a much better solution than loading apps for individual stations, as It is much easier to switch between stations.  I do wish there was an optional interface , where you could toggle between my favorite stations without having to look at the phone.  perhaps by swiping, or shaking the phone. overall a fantastic app!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Easy to learn, fun to play.  My children range in ages from 9 to 16 and they all 4 love this game, and I am addicted as well.  You can expand faster with actual money, but I don't allow in-app purchases - and my kids don't mind at all!  They spend a lot of time planning whether it is better to spend their earned game coins on food to make the dragons grow faster and yield more coins, purchase decorations to give them more visitors and thus more xp points, or save the coins to buy larger habitats to fit more dragons.  They understand that they aren't guaranteed a certain dragon every time they breed, they wait with excitement while the egg grows, and they put a lot of thought into which habitat the dragon should live in to bring them the most coins. In a world full of games that promote instant gratification, results without any thought or effort, and easy payoffs, this game is a welcome relief!  Without realizing it, my children are learning to use logic and strategy, exercise patience, ask others for advice when they can't seem to advance to a new level or figure out how to make a desired habitat fit on the island, and put a lot of thought and focused effort into collecting the dragons they desire.  A dozen times a day I find two or more of them sitting and discussing strategies they used, and cheering for each other when their sibling breeds a rare dragon or advances to a level no one has seen before. We've been using a website with breeding charts and learning about ratios and percentages too (and no, we do not homeschool - I just take advantage of learning opportunities when I can to advance their life skills)  Is it a game?  Yes.  Is it fun?  Yes.  Is it addictive?  Certainly.  Do you have to spend money to enjoy it?  No - but you can if you want too (just don't tell my kids that is how I caught up with them!)  Kids are going to play games, and they are going to want to play the popular ones - I don't feel bad about them playing this one because there are so many benefits as well.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son. he seemed very happy with it . He told me he watched it
0765325950|1.0|Misguided decision to delay ebook version until April represents a callous attitude towards even the most faithful of fans. And yes, voicing this protest is a worthwhile use of the review process.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is very fun for both young kids and adults. The problem is that it only allows you one life before you either need to buy more life or wait 20 minuets to play again. Stupid!
B0060AY6FO|2.0|James is a good writer......usually.  This was a dull mystery with so little energy.  The same scene is played out a dozen times.  Focusing on Darcy was a mistake.  The court proceedings had promise but more repetition.  And it is all solved by a contrivance.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Our petite one year old niece began cradling and hugging this doll immediately. It is just the right size for a little one.
B008O2T3O0|4.0|There is very little that i can add to what has already been said about this disc.  But i just wanted to add my two cents.  The real star of this production is definitely Leo Nucci.  This is definitely a Rigoletto for the history books!! Both vocally and acting, this performance is incredibly good.  Beczala is well suited for the role of the Duke vocally, but his acting could use some improvement.  Compare this to the Pavarotti performance mentioned in other reviews.  Mr Pavarotti was far from being as good looking as Mr Beczala, yet he could charm the pants off anyone !!  We next come to Ms Mosuc.  What a beautiful voice, but what a bad actress!!  She stood there half the time - like saying to the audience \\"look at me, what a great singer I am!!!\\"  Even her duet with Beczala where they are saying goodbye to each other in Act 2 - no passion, no feeling. She should take some acting tips from Ms Peetz (Magdalena) who was incredibly good in her role.  By the way, this is the first performance I have seen, where the singers take bows after their aria.  I have only seen this done when the audience applauds for an ENORMOUS length of time and practically stops the show. So I am going to \\"assume\\" that part was cut from the final product for brevity sake. But all this aside I do have to agree the real reason to get this disc is the high quality of the recording itself.  The visuals and the sound are incredibly good, unlike any I have seen before (including other discs from Arthaus).  All I can say is that I was hesitant to purchase this (even at the low price) but now I am glad I did!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have NEVER been someone who followed a show. I scoffed at those who did, until Downton!! I am addicted...and I mean addicted!! It is my break from reality! I am a Registered Nurse and when I get home and just want to relax and float away on a cloud....I turn on my Kindle and watch the Seasons 1, 2 and now 3!!! Well written so that all members of the cast are integral parts of the whole...I want to know about each one! The surroundings and the attire is magnificent! Maggie is utterly fantastic- her sarcasm is just too cute!!

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|The app keeps freezing than quits. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice and it still won't work. I love the app on my ipad but HATE it on the kindle fire.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this is a great game good graphics easy game play good for hours of fun only down side is having to pay for some of. the better abilities and fairies
B00785P2QC|4.0|One of the best city tycoon games I've played, although it is definitely a waiting game. You wait for money to build up, you wait for energy to build up, and its almost impossible to keep your citizens happy without extravagant spending. So, like real life, then :) You should definitely try this as long as you`'re prepared to be patient or shell out some cash to make things go faster.
0307730697|5.0|Enjoyed Adam's story when I borrowed the book from a friend and then had to add it to my collection.  It's amazing all the demons he had to fight and still be one of our great american heros.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Loved every minute of it--and it didn't take many of them since it was as riveting as they all are.
0891419063|5.0|This is a great book and makes me have even more respect for the guys who fought for our freedoms.  I wish that the people of today could get a glimpse into what made this country so great and remember the heros (even though they don't think they are).

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I really love Mitch. I thought for the most part the book was good. Short sentences and chapters make it more suspenseful than it probably was.

All in all, a quick enjoyable read.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of an author friend on Facebook(South of Bixby Bridge) and the reason I'm mentioning this, is because authors don't often recommend other authors unless they're extraordinary, and Colleen Hoover is just that.  Through a link, I immediately looked up Hopeless and was amazed at over a thousand glowing reviews by readers.  It takes a lot for an ordinary reader to both giving a book praise, but all these readers did so, which made me click on the buy button to download Hopeless on my Kindle.<br /><br />I was not disappointed! Hopeless is not your ordinary teen romance novel, filled with mean girls, hot guys, werewolves and vampires.  Sky is a real 17 year-old with serious problems.  And throughout Hopeless, she shows great courage in facing her demons, while falling in love with one of the best teenage boys in the history of writing(okay, Rhett Butler still holds my heart, but he's not a teenager so it doesn't count).<br /><br />Holder is sensitive, and hot.  Everything a teen romance novel needs, but he's far from one-dimensional.  What makes Holder so sensational, is that he's a rock when it comes to supporting Sky through the worst time of her life.<br /><br />Beware parents.  This novel is very layered, and therefore contains some pretty heavy things that a younger child might not be able to deal with, but on the other hand, I feel like this book would be a good one for older teens, and even adults, because it brings up a subject that is far too often never talked about.  I won't go into more, but along with teen sex, this is a mature audience only book.<br /><br />Hoover's writing is so true-to-life-emotional, that it's nearly impossible not to feel everything along with her characters, and completely impossible to put down.  I noticed that hundreds of readers highlighted the same phrases in this book.  I believe that it's because Hoover's writing is so honest.  It's like she's reading from a 17 year-old's diary.  Her writing painfully honest, vulnerable, and achingly beautiful.  Hoover really connects with her readers, who I'm assuming are teenagers, a group that can't abide anything fake.  Hoover's writing is anything but fake.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Hopeless, especially since I'm not usually into teen novels, mostly because I'm not a teen myself anymore.  Hopeless transcends the teen genre, speaking the truth that all great writers must if their writing is to live on after the current fad wears off.g painfully honest, vulnerable, and achingly beautiful.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is easy and fun. I enjoy getting on my kindle except I cant figure out a few things
B008J1QFLU|5.0|It is really not necessary to add anything about the artistic value of this Ring, a true pioneer recording that assembled the greatest Wagner singers of the era, brilliantly produced and performed by the inimitable Wiener Philharmoniker under Georg Solti, a great collaboration.<br />The present edition is a beautiful labor of love for this great recording, offered in a true deluxe packaging, the newly remastered Cds sounding fresher than ever.<br />But what prompted me to write this review is the ground-breaking inclusion of a Blu-ray audio containing the 4 operas in true lossless sound, a staggering listening experience. For the first time I can understand what all the hubbub was about the Sofiensaal, the recording location not only for the Ring but for countless other fabulous Decca recordings. The lossless audio brings the full warmth and brilliance of this exceptional hall, highlighting the great playing of the Viennese orchestra and the true heft of those legendary voices. Just listen to the very beginning of Rheingold with the E-flat pedal and the crystal clear first utterance of the Rheinmaidens, or listen to Flagstad's and London's first exchanges to be completely bowled over by the wealth of detail and punch the 24-bit is capable of rendering.<br />I would strongly urge Decca to fully embrace this medium and perhaps issue other great recordings of the period like Solti's Salome and Elektra, Mahler's 8th, etc. in Blu-ray.<br />In all strongly reccomended, a Diamond Ring indeed

B0083P1QUM|3.0|I found it was a slow read in the beginning . It took a while for me to get into it and I was extremely disappointed. If I hadn't paid for it, I probably would have stopped reading it. But I'm glad I didn't. It turned out to be interesting
B0063IH60K|5.0|When you just want to relax but keep your mind going it's the best game to play. Highly recommend downloading!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is a fun toy.  We bought it for my 7 year old who loves figuring out how things work.  It keeps him busy.  He is able to do parts of it, but definitely not the whole thing.  Actually no one in the family is yet to do the whole thing.  Very challenging.  I would consider getting him another version.  I've seen some that weren't as challenging.  He would probably like that too.  Good toy for when boredom sets in.
1878424319|5.0|Teaches valuble lessons about how we come to believe things and how to update beliefs that no longer serve us.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show, and I HATE CBS's online interface.  I'd rather sign up for the season pass and pay per episode than deal with their player.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesome job guys great game. Couldn't ask for a better game. Good job one can only wonder what more in store.
B009M7G1PU|4.0|Lots of typos and punctuation errors in this kindle edition but not so terrible that you can't read around them. Book itself- classic and a very interesting portrayal of life and issues in post-WWI England. More explicit than expected, but I didn't mind. :)
B00866JL96|2.0|Of course the heroine is beautiful. Of course the hero is attractive. Of course the ex-husband is a jerk. Of course the scenery is romantic... but that's not the point.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br /><br />There's no reason for me to write a review for this movie. I do it simply because i wanna share a common trend in Hollywood that is truly dissapointing, story-wise. I wrote about it previously for two other movies but it could be the same for countless of other films. That is, what i call, the \\"stretching effect\\". You have a good idea. Not necessarily original. But good nonetheless. You set the story in motion with interesting characters and a captivating plot. Then, the hero needs to tell something to the heroine. If he does, it will destroy something. Drama will follow. We are at about thirty minutes, or so, in the movie. My point is: why not reveal the darn thing right there? Let it break something. Let drama unfold. And then, go in a new and original direction. Instead, the hero will shut up, for X or Y reason. He will not reveal what he should reveal. The story will stretch for a good hour before, finally, at the end, the hero can at last reveal what he should have revealed sixty minutes ago. But then, when it becomes interesting, well, the movie is over. Plus, with all the films built in the same fashion, you pretty much guess everything that's gonna happen anyway. No suspense there.<br /><br />And then, there's another sad trend in Hollywood: the overlong and unnecessary intro. Why not start immediatly with a close-up on the picture, then on the soldier who picks it up? You see the explosion then, on to the hospital where the hero realises that the picture actually \\"saved\\" him by moving him away from the explosion. There. Not even five minutes. Done. The real movie can begin. Instead, we go through scenes and scenes of war, explosions, dialogues, so on and so on. It's not a war movie. It's a romantic story. There is plenty of original ways to suggest whatever you want without spending too much time on it. But that's Hollywood. Always putting more.<br /><br />And then, there's Zac Efron. I thought he was pretty good. Surprising even. But i never really bought the fact that a woman like that would fall in love with a boy like that. Not a man. A boy. He looked like a teenager. I would have prefered an older actor with a harsher face. Like Daniel Craig, for example.<br /><br />When you spend more time wondering about how a movie could have been better - while the movie is playing - well...
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I didn't like this app, because of the fact that it didn't give me what info I was looking for. Only a bunch of unnecessary questions that didn't even have anything to do with what I was looking for.
B003H8WSLQ|3.0|I want to love this album but just about every other song channels that awful, 80's fringe-rock vocal whining that makes me cringe.  The band sounds good... is that a drum mistake about 2 mins in on the first track or a badly placed echo effect?  Anyway, I'll say this - I will probably check out some other music by them.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I intend to  use this app at church, bible study and at home too. I really like having this app on my tablet.
B003V1WTMM|2.0|Good mystery, but based on mental illness, alcoholism, and codependency that I found depressing. I loved Forgotten Garden so I was looking forward to this book.
1401323820|5.0|Love it! Can't put the book down. Got hooked on it from the tv show on ABC on Monday nights
B004VMUS9G|5.0|My kids and I all use this alarm clock because we can personalize it.  Thank you for making this perfect app!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love this show! Watch it every week and think the characters play well off of each other. Going to get season 2 now!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very nice download and quality picture. Would highly recommend using Amazon videos. I intend to make more video download purchases.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|A big mess trying to get on Says another user has the account A big disappointmentWhat else can I say
B0084IG8TM|4.0|But this one pulled it out. Jennifer Lawrence does sulky disadvantaged teen better than anyone, Woody is great as Haymitch and I was surprised and touched at Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. Special effects and adaptation of the story are well done-looking forward to &#34;Catching Fire&#34;.
B000FC10WU|5.0|This is the first book I purchased for my new Kindle Paperwhite.  I've always loved Agatha Christie, and this book didn't disappoint! The quality was great. Definitely a great beginning to my relationship with my new Kindle.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|How often does that happen? But Will, Tommy Lee and Josh Brolin with a surprisingly good performance as young K give us another hilarious story of wacky world salvation.
0553386697|5.0|This book is a easy read and will give you a wonderful insight into how the brain works and ways to integrate the brain in a very mindful way.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Billie Joe's finest brand of rebel potty mouth, the boys get back to what made them famous in the first place.  Of course American Idiot was great, I just happen to like it a little rough.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|May the Dark Knight live forever with Nightwing! What great way to end the Dark Knight and bring in Robin presumably as Nightwing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Enjoyable and interesting. Graphics are very good. Story line is creative and easy to follow.<br />Hints are useful and give good direction to continue play.
B006QS07IK|5.0|This book is a classic.  They have bound it in leather with a wonderful picture on the front.  It looks like a classic novel on the bookshelf, but when you pull it out you can see how modern it really is.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is a wonderful backup alarm. Great for travelling. Works just as advertised.  The<br />versatility. is amazing for a free app.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This box set has so much in it.  The box itself is very nice, similar to the one for Star Wars.  This is a great series of movies to watch, and don't forget Prometheus, too.
B008KMHFJY|3.0|Its not the most amazing book and the plot it not that thick, but I couldnt put it down. so there's  got to be something said for that.<br /><br />Quite dark in terms of the the really warped relationship shared between Abby and Travis but if you've ever been in a &#34;blind love&#34; relationship you'll be able to related somewhat.<br /><br />Its a holiday read. Don't expect it to rock your world though.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is fun and challenging,and easy to learn.I Have recommended this game to all my senior friends. Sometimes I get so involved,I loose track of time.
0765325950|5.0|Just finished it. Gonna keep this short.<br /><br />Wow. What a saga. It was the ending I've wanted for more than a decade, the ending I expected, and yet the twists along the way were interesting and surprising and fitting.<br /><br />I'm not sad it's over; I'm happy it happened.<br /><br />Thank you, Jim and Brandon.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Yet another fantastic story that features shifts in narration and time and that presents a haunting and ultimately satisfying  resolution.
B009VL299E|5.0|Got it about a month ago and what can I say its fricken awesome!!! This is the exact same tour I saw them on back in 2009 In D.C apart of their Death Magnetic tour. Entirely the same setlist and the same intensity I witnessed when I saw them 4 yrs ago. I love this band they are my favorite I would kill to see them again they are without a doubt the greatest metal band that ever existed. If you are a big Metallica fan you know you gotta check this dvd out or hell even buy its def worth $13 bucks or $15 whichever it is I mean thats cheap for a two disc set that spans over 20 live tracks some new (Death Magnetic) and some older Metallica classics my only complaint is I wish Metallica would play some more of their older songs you never hear much like Orion, Escape, The Call of Ktulu, The thing that should not be, Leper Messiah, Metal Militia, Jump in the Fire, The God that failed, that would be great! But at least they threw Phantom Lord, and Whiplash in their that was a shocker alright. And too bad they didnt do anything from Load and Reload some of those songs would have been great to hear but I know all about the haters on those two albums and I wont even mention St. Anger which I loved btw. Bottom line this dvd is badass!! A great show that could be yours for a very low price I wouldnt hesitate on buying this easily better then their Three nights in Mexico, The Big Four, and Cunning stunts dvds. BUY THIS!!!! You'll love it I'm telling you.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best written by John Grisham. I have not read his books lately, but am so glad a friend suggested it to me . This book does 'drag&#34; in places, but it worth a good read. I am an avid reader for relaxation, and it was one I had difficulty putting down.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Granddaughter wanted this CD for Christmas. She was excited to open her package and find it. Local prices were higher as usual.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|One of the more attention holding movies that I have recently watched that it made me watch the next in the trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is better than temple run because you do t have to tilt your device. All you do is swipe I give it 6 out of 5 stars
B002U6CJCO|4.0|I am a fan of the series, and I loved the interactions with Dolph, but it could have been a little more.
0143034901|5.0|This was a summer book club selection that I read 4 ? years ago.  It was so much fun to read...so many twists and mysteries to solve....it was a romance, mystery, rags to riches story....I couldn't wait to pick it up and read it further that summer.  I feel sorry for the bad reviews....you guys didn't give this book and chance or even worse ....just didn't get it.  It was the same in my book club....some ladies didn't get it.....but if they kept at it they would have read a memorable book that I still can't get out of my head as the one of the best books I've ever read.  :)
0807014273|5.0|simply an amazing book by a inspirational person. I could tell right away from reading the first few pages I was in for a treat. THANKS Bryan Callen for referring this book!<br /><br />-Ralph M., from Huntington beach, ca
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Simple and addicting game. Makes me laugh every time I shake. Definitely worth taking the minute to download. BONUS this app is free!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it!! Very addictive and fun! Recommend it if you have free time!! There are many fun games to play and all are different
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this product. The keys are big and easy to see. I love the fact that it is easy to touch the keys the first time.
1781163243|5.0|Its an art book. Really great art from story boards and concepts from the aliens and ships and environments to the various armors wore by Spartans. Really nice layouts and well worth the price of this book. Again the art is beautiful with little notes from the artists about their ideas and what they were going for. Again if your a Halo fan it cant be missed. If your an art lover its got some beautiful enviroments and character concepts and just an overall great reference book as well for the aspiring artist.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Rattling good yarns - always with a twist, just when you think you know 'who did it' - you are wrong!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|If youve been following the show then its a must. I cant really say much, the cover art is what you see but how it book opens is nicely layed out with beautiful artwork and photos.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read too many books to not recognize what was going to happen in this book! But the love from these two was overwhelming enough to keep turning the pages! The innocence of each other but yet the hidden parts of each other's love is so intense! Thank you for this story!  I will highly recommend it to all my book reading friends!
1581806248|5.0|This is a great book for painters to learn how to paint almost every flower.  It's a great learning tool.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My 4 year old loves this game! I have tried many of the free games for her. This one I may even purchase.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read all 3 books in this group and I enjoyed all three of them. I would recommend this book and I have to a few people and they have enjoyed it as well.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|Was a gift for a man. Its padded on the inside and protects the kindle from harm. Looks nice and durable on the outside.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this was and is an excellent app. get it I you want something fun and useful, not to mention beautifully crafted.
034580404X|4.0|The series was okay. Although after the first book some scenes seemed very predictable and repetitive due to overuse of the same word phrasings and such. Overall it was a good series but I found myself skimming past quite a bit as I read.
B006H5120E|5.0|Leonardio DiCaprio is an Animal and Kate Winslet is a Monster, LOL.<br />Everyone that was involved in the making of this movie did a phenomenal Job.<br /><br />I wish Jack and Rose would of really met aboard the Titanic in 1912. These Characters had something very special even though it was short lived. However there are many events throughout the movie that were told by survivors to have happened as depicted. I recommend checking out IMDB for trivia, goofs and quotes.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love shopping on my amazon app, I can mostly everything on here as if it was on a real desktop.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|He is always readable, but his plot goes beyond credibility.  What's with the title? I didn't get who the Racjeteer was supposed to be.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|It´s the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, what else could be said?<br /><br />The 5 albums included in this boxset are staples in the prog genre, this classic albums have been remastered in both stereo and surround mixes, the surround mixes are a reason alone to buy this boxset (at least for me, as I did).<br /><br />I was surprissed by the excellent work that was put in all the albums, the first 2 (Trespass and Nursery Crime) sound like new, like if they had come to life for the first time, Foxtrot it´s back in all of its glory; Supper`s Ready has never sounded better, Selling England By the Pound its terrific; I was able to hear new details in most of the songs, specially on The Battle of Epping Forest. As for The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway... WOW, it`s like a complete different álbum, so much more detail, Back in NYC has some notable changes, Carpet Crawlers fills the room, The Waiting Room gives you chills, The Lamia sounds beautiful and many more.<br /><br />There´s also an extra tracks disc which includes two superb singles (Happy the Man and the famous Twilight Alehouse), some demos and the very rare Genesis Plays Jackson soundtrack that contains 4 songs that would later become part of many songs on later albums.<br /><br />Each album comes in a CD/DVD package including the surround mix, interviews and video footage, in case you`re wondering, all those extras are excellent and complement the experience in a lot of ways, and as a bonus; The Lamb includes the original slideshow of the whole album that was used back in the days when it was on tour, it`s such a nice addition.<br /><br />My final veredict is that, If you like Gabriel´s Genesis you should get this boxset ASAP.<br />  SIT DOWN AND ENJOY
B0001JXQDI|3.0|I bought the DVD just to listen to the DVD audio sound. It wasn't that much better than the regular mp3. I'm keeping it as souvenir but would not buy another DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best stories I've read in a long time. I stayed up all night reading just to see how it would end. This book has so many twists but flowed so well!
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I saw the performance on the OPB fund raiser a yeaar ago and felll in love with the Celtic singers and violinist.  The talent is amazing.  How your found four ladies with such beauty and composure is a treat.  The music and photogrophy is wonderful..I have spread the word and our circle of apppreciation is growing.  When will you be in Portland, Oregon !<br /><br />Don Stepp
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We are enthralled to the story line and the history that it portrays in a dramatic setting.  I can't wait to watch the other installments.  I will be purchasing Season 3 as soon as it is on the market.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|To predictable, I found the book to be little boring actually. I have heard so much about this book , but was not impressed by the story.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I think the costs for advancement are a little steep. still entertaining tho. miss the original ponies from the early 90's from hasbro. add me on fl for gems... yzrider3
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down I read it in just days and as I lay here having just finished it I have renewed hope for my own life and I will never look at the sky the same ever again .thank to the author
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book is awesome and should be in every high schools library.  Once you start to read it you wont put it down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you are interested in law/ crime, defending Jacob is a great book that I couldn't put down. The book is a lifetime/SVU/ Criminal minds episode all in one. The story is twisted and you're not really sure until the end.
0765325950|5.0|Anyone who gave this a 1 star rating simply because of no e-book should be ashamed. You people are an absolute disgrace and your selfish attitudes should be taken elsewhere. You know, before kindles people read actual books, and it is still my favorite way to read. Maybe if you guys didn't expect everything to be handed to you and stop whining like a bunch of babies, you'd realize that rating it 1 star does absolutely NOTHING for you so called \\"cause\\".<br /><br />With that being said, this book is simply the perfect ending to the series. Could'nt have asked for anything better.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD was a gift, but after using it, I would recommend it. The tutorial could be more clear, but I'm and old timer.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Amazing beginning, awful performance and hateful character in regards to Jim Kirk , very short and sometimes not believable script, in general the movie respects the saga, excellent visual effects, poor finish
0316056871|5.0|got it for my mom for Christmas, she keeps telling me it is hilarious and says thanks.  Great gift idea!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The story is a troubling but very well written.  The gist of it is all about the awarkwardness of high school with some added complexities from Charlie.  Definitely recommend but it is not light reading by any means.  I saw the movie first and really enjoyed the movie.  So I would also highly recommend that as well.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|&#34;An Awesome Wave&#34; is one of those undeniably great albums.  The more you listen to it the more details you notice.  Definitely worth the purchase.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I THINK COIN DOZER IS NOT A BAD THING BUT NOT A GOOD THING BUT I LOVE PLAYING COIN DOZER ;)'
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|This was a great movie. I would sugest it to other people. Would rent again if going on a road trip
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I actually purchased this hoping that it would work with my digital cameras. I asked sellers all over online for the inner measurements, and couldn't get anyone to understand, and write me back a proper answer. But I was right, it works/fits with my Canon A34000 IS HD PowerShot digital camera, my Canon S500 PowerShot digital camera, and my Cyber Cam point/shoot digital camera. My Cyber Cam digital camera doesn't have a screw hole in it for regular tripods, so I was determined to find a tripod that would work with it. And this one does!!  I believe it would fit camera up to a 7/8&#34; thickness width.  I hope this info will help others.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Very relaxing and enjoyable. Somewhat challenging. Had to use the hints often,  but sometimes have think outside the normal. Nice and clear scenes.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|A good story of ancient times when men were men and life was hard. It is a story about life in the middle ages and religion is regulating peoples' lives and their professions. It is a story about the corruption of the Catholic church and the mysteries of the church and the dangers of defiance of church ritual.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a very fun book.  There's plenty of humor, and the engineering/science is surprisingly plausible.  At the price I paid this was a steal.  I'd say this book resembles Ben Bova's \\"Mars\\" without being any kind of rip-off.<br /><br />I recommend this highly if it's even vaguely interesting from the description.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This has become one of my favorite book series. I highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone. I look forward to reading the next one.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Was just a great show. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean was superior. The best part was the end when the original casts came on stage.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I bought this DVD for my brother for Christmas. It came right on time and was in new condition. My brother has not watched the DVD yet, but the disk looked brand new.
0763657875|5.0|First grade class loves this! It also seems to be will built although all pop up books are prone to damage if not careful. It is quite accurate in my evaluation as we lived in London for some time and just moved back. After reading this and another children's book in my wife's first grade class the students checked out every England themed book at the school library.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I am pleased with this purchase. I bought this DVD for my brother for Christmas and it came on time and was in perfect condition. He has not watched the season yet ,but the DVD looked like it was in new condition.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|This book explains the story without giving away the plot of the previous books.  New characters are introduced which deepens the story.  Great read for middle-schoolers.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|what else can i say. It is a slightly watered down version of the full website. The latest updates are solid, but nothing crazy awesome. sometimes is does not work right, but will work if closed and re-opened.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|Absolutely love this CD,Vivere Live in Tuscany-Andrea Bocelli. The best one of Bocelli's that I have. Listen to it over and over again.
B006O3MU96|4.0|I got a Kindle for Christmas and downloaded this with in minuted of activating it. It was really fun and similar to the original. I would come home from work to find my brother and mom fighting over who got to play it.
0321857895|5.0|Loved it<br /><br />Very useful tutorial and help<br />Would recommend it without reservation<br />Easy to follow and useful<br />thanks Mike<br />Rob
0307341577|3.0|After reading Gone Girl and Sharp Objects, this one went a little slower for me.  It was interesting, but I loved the twists and turns in her other novels, and this one didn't happen until the very end of the book and was a bit far fetched (yet expected based on the characters in the book).  I'll keep reading her as her others have been fantastic - this one was just okay.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|An amazing inspirational story, written by an amazing person. How she not only survived, but also became the positive person she is today is a mystery, and a testament to her and those surrounding her.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Won't go into the series in this review.  What I can say is that after watching every episode in the box set, and reading the inserts, and extras included on the discs.  Highly excellent quality to match an excellent series.  Will definitely buy season 2 on BRD when it becomes available.
1419703692|5.0|As a huge fan, words cannot describe the attention to detail and how complete this is; I totally recommend to anyone looking for a piece of The Dark Knight history. Lots of pictures, and inside access to this aqwsome trilogy.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The first three books in this series were excellent.  I could hardly put them down.  The fourth book bored me almost to tears.  This book wasn't quite so boring, but was still not up to the standards of the first three.  I read it because I'm committed to the series.  Lets hope the next book is better.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I saw this cd in walmart, and I have read part one of the trilogy. I don't know if I'll read anymore of them, it seems a little &#34;f----- up to me but the music is beautiful. Great service great and cheaper price than walmart.. A ++++++
B00005N6KG|5.0|So I was looking for a set of headphones. Most of the really good ones are a bit high-priced and I didn't want something that would just sit on my ears and itch, pinch, or otherwise irritate them. Maybe I'm a tad hyper-sensitive, but I hate having big ugly things on my ears just so I can listen to music in public. So I bought these. I just received my headphones and had to test them out. For the price, I don't expect much and these aren't noise-canceling headphones, but they're good about delivering Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's \\"Hawaiian Suppa Man\\" straight to my ears with better quality than my laptop speakers. They're small and lightweight and I did have to extend the sides a little bit to get it to fit on my head. And they don't irritate my ears at all. Basically, it suits my needs.<br /><br />Edit 8.26.13: These headphones were destroyed by my kitten. Pretty good while they lasted though.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is definitely a must read! The author uses enough detail to give u vivid images of the characters, but keeps u guessing all the way to the end....I am ready for the next one.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|It is a great book I love it, everybody that I know who read it loves it, Stephinie Meyer you are one of my favorite authors.
0785139168|5.0|I bought my 13 year old pseudo step daughter a collection of Jane Austen... she was having problems understand Regency speak so I figured that a comic version may be more understandable.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I was surprised by how much I loved this book! It was quick, entertaining and delightful to read! The amalgamation of books  and technology was superb and like nothing I've read before. I've recommended this book to several people already.
0345529057|5.0|My wife loves these books. Shipped on time and the books are quality. 5 stars for the book set, yay. She is on book 5 and raves about the writing.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|Great price and arrived quick. Perfect purchase for my twin girls.  Always looking for Disney at a low price.  Perfect
B002MQYOFW|5.0|-The Hunger Games Book Review-<br /> This book is a thriller, a love story, a mystery, and an action novel. It always has you on your toes. You think something is going to happen and then \\"Bam!\\" the total unexpected happens. You can find yourself reading a chapter, then get so caught up in all the action and mystery that you just go ahead and read through the next three chapters, without even noticing. You just can't seem to put it down.<br /> I must say, my favorite part of the book is when Katniss stands up to the Capitol when one of her fellow tribute friends die. The way she comes up with speaking out to the Capitol, about how the tributes are real people and not just game piece's in the game. She does this in such a way where she doesn't even have to say a word to the Capitol. Like the famous saying, \\"Actions speak louder then words.\\" Her action said it all to the Capitol and the Capitol's fellow citizens, watching the games back home on their TV screens.<br /> Overall, this is a very good book to read. Its a great action book for teenagers and adults!<br />-Morgan Russell(:

1400067936|4.0|Having reviewed Taleb's new book Antifragile (Taleb, 2012), I was encouraged to go back and also review his earlier book Fooled by Randomness (Taleb, 2004). As with my previous review, I ask three questions: `what is the book about, what can we learn from it and what do I think of it'? Why these three questions? They help me think in terms of the objective (what is `it'), the inter-subjective (what can `we' learn from it) and the subjective (what do `I' think about it), i.e., the three domains of knowledge that philosophers have long thought to be present in each and every phenomenon (Kant, Plato, Torbert, Wilber).<br /><br /> What is it? The central theme of the book is that we are Fooled by Randomness. We are not wired, says Taleb, to understand probabilities and thus we underestimate the share of randomness in almost everything. This is primarily due to a lack of appreciation of how our emotions rather than our thinking influence our actions. The main point is that estimating probabilities in `symmetric' environments (such as in a coin toss) is completely different to estimating probabilities in an `asymmetric' environment were the odds payoffs are different (as in the stock market). Taleb, by his own admission, comes from the `tragic view of mankind' side of the house as opposed to the utopian view of mankind as proposed by Rousseau, Thomas Paine and others. The tragic view of mankind believes there are inherent limitations and flaws in the way we think and act. His major influencers include: Karl Hopper [scientific falsification and distrust of intellectual answers, actually of anyone who is confident that he knows anything with certainty]. Frederick Hayek and Milton Friedman [suspicious of governments], Adam Smith [intentions of man], Herbert Simon [bounded rationality], Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman [heuristics and biases], speculator George Soros, philosopher Charles Sanders Pierce and perhaps most important John Maynard Keynes [Treatise on Probability].<br /><br /> What can we learn from it? A few things stand out; a) that random events happen more often than we think, b) that is doesn't matter how often you win if a large loss can wipe you out, i.e., a black swan event, c) that we don't `intuitively' manage probabilistic thinking very well - it requires discipline, d) that we are wired to react emotionally to uncertainty and thus need cognitive tricks to help us avoid it, e) that our cognitive apparatus generally plays an inferior role to our emotional machinery in directing our actions, f) that we cannot judge a performance in a given field from the result - we need to know how the game was played. Why?  Because certainty is something that is likely to take place across the highest number of different alternative histories, uncertainty concerns events that should take place in the lowest number of them. Improving our probabililty thinking is about identifying the `uncertain' events, the invisible risks that might harm us.  Taleb uses a monte carlo simulator to help him generate these alternative paths, g) that the impact of holding debt is asymmetric; a small drop in the market is rapidly multiplied by leverage - how well has this lesson been learned in recent years, both when markets went up and down?<br />Early in the book he provides a list of `tensions' which he calls his `table of confusion' and says that, often people think they are talking about the former when in fact they are referring to the later, i.e., `skills and luck, `historical determinism and randomness', `certainty and probability', knowledge and belief', `reality and theory', `casuality and anecdote', `prophecy and forecasts'. He also highlights `a lack of understanding of standard error and critical thinking' and how `probability is a qualitative subject' by which he means that what matters most in probability is not the quantitative statistical method used but the qualitative `assumptions' underpinning ones approach to it.<br /><br /> What doI think of it? I am pleased to be reminded of the core concepts of the book. When I first read Fooled by Randomness in 2006, I didn't fully appreciate the difference between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of probability; I was assuming a quantitative only approach. I am also not sure I really understood the `inductive problem', i.e., going from the particular to the general. This becomes much clearer when put in the context of behavioural science and how heuristics and biases influence decisions under uncertainty. In this context it is useful to read Kahneman's (2012) latest book Thinking Fast Thinking Slow. I am also pleased to be re-introduced to the scepticism of David Hume and to Karl Popper who both addressed the issues of inference and the induction problem. For Popper there are two types of theories; those that have been proven wrong (falsified) and those that have yet to be proven wrong (falsifiable). How much closer can we get to the truth if we concentrate on `falsification' as opposed to `verification' and how could we improve ourselves and our research by offering up conditions in which our theories and results could be rejected? Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's business partner of 40 years), who also comes from the doom and gloom side of the house, says that until you are able to argue the case against yourself you are not ready to go forward. In my own experience I have found this kind of `falsification' very difficult. As I observe myself, I am draw to `confirming' as opposed to `disconfirming' evidence of my underlying view, whatever it is.<br /><br /> The standout learning for me however is Taleb's highlighting of the confusion between `probability and expectation' in Chapter 6, `Skewness and Asymmetry'. That is the first thing. The second thing is what has it caused me to do? Perhaps the easiest way of explaining this is to assume you are making a bet where the probability of winning or losing and the gain from winning or loosing are notthe same. In this case the environment is `asymmetric'. This is by way of contrasting a `symmetric' environment, such as a coin-toss, where the odds are even and the winner takes all. Warren Buffett describes this issue as follows: Buffett (1989)  says, that in estimating the probability of an event (could be a bet at the races) you should, \\"Take the probability of gain times the amount of the possible gain from the probability of loss times the amount of the loss\\". This is another way of saying, `take the weighted outcome of the probable and improbable outcomes'. For instance, in a bet where you have the same chance to win $200 as loose $100, the `weighted outcome' is $50 which is in your favour, whereas the other way around the weighted outcome would be -$50 which is not in your favour in which case it would not make sense to take the bet. This may seem obvious, but it is nonetheless the kind of simple mistake of reason that can lead to a sub-optimal probability decisions. The other key point is to `do your own estimates', i.e., don't take the odds offered by the track or the prices quoted on the exchange - do your own estimates of the probable and improbable outcomes and then look at what prices are on offer. If the weighted outcome is your favour then you can consider proceeding, if not' then don't. Of course you can't do this unless you know something about the environment you are in, hence Buffett's definition of risk being \\"not knowing what you are doing\\".<br /><br /> This has caused me to reflect on whether this simple approach to estimating the `weighted outcome' can get over the inductive problem and the extent to which `heuristics and biases' occupy the path. I was thinking this morning for instance on a bet on a forthcoming game of Rugby (partly as a way to improve my probabilistic thinking) and I wondered where the information to make the decision was coming from? I noticed a few things; firstly I wasn't taking a very disciplined approach to working out the probabilities. Secondly, I hadn't considered that I was operating in an `asymmetric' environment and what that meant, i.e., that I needed to do more work on the `alternative histories' in assessing the risk. Thirdly, I don't think I have sufficiently acknowledged that in `asymmetric environments' that are certain things that are `unknowable' and so even after working out the probabilities you are still taking a `punt' so to speak. (Buffett would cover this aspect of risk taking by having a sufficiently large `Margin of Safety'). Fourthly, this approach also has some consequences, i.e., that I am likely to turn down many more bets than make them. I was presupposing I was `taking the bet' whatever the odds - this more disciplined approach is likely to stop you making those kind of `entertaining' bets. It will offend your response of probability. Fiftly, I noticed the extent to which I was heuristic information (rules of thumb) as well as cognitive and emotional biases to form my opinion which I would then act on. For instance a friend of mine mentioned that one of teams was doing really and had great players this year - I trust the friend so I seemed to also trust his judgment on the team. I processed his comments like picking up a `tip' at the racetrack. I also have an emotional bias in favour of this team because I went to school there. Is this really the best I can do in making a decision to `bet' (change the word to `invest') in a positive outcome? Finally, I also began to see the extent to which `heuristics and biases' were apparent in other decisions - such as in my approach to investing and to making decisions generally. This is the real learning for me.<br /><br />Much as I like the book however and much as I have learned from it, there are some things that I think Taleb misses. For instance in his critique of Warren Buffett I think he is exposing himself to being \\"hoisted on his own petard\\". For instance, I am not sure why he takes a cut at Warren Buffett while at the same time demonstrating his admiration for George Soros. Taleb seems to be letting his `irritation' with Buffett get in the way of seeing someone who is truly skilled in probability and risk taking and someone who could be an exemplar for the kind probabilistic thinking he very much favours. Charlie Munger would be another one. Looking through the lens of Taleb's latest book Antifragile, Buffett and Munger have possibly created the most Antifragile business (Berkshire Hathaway) in the S&P 500. Further, Buffett is not at all Fooled by Randomness. If anyone that gets the importance of randomness in life and business it is Buffett. At the core of Buffett's and Berkshire's business is insurance. Buffett's ability to estimate the probability of events and to charge an appropriate risk premium has meant that Berkshire has had a positive combined ratio (premium to payout) for over a 40 year period. Taleb later said (Taleb 2010) that we don't have enough information to say with certainty that Buffett is not a random event. In a very narrow technical sense he may be correct, but in terms of the second-order effects of such a conclusion it is nonsense. Even the most recent academic coverage of Buffett is coming around to the seeing the `Buffett alpha' (Frazini, Kabiller & Pedersen, 2012). Time manages to smooth out much of the impact of `unusual' randomness and in Buffett's case what is `unusual' is that he doesn't outperform the market every year. Over the past 55 years there has only been 8 years in which Buffett has failed to outperform the market. In other words the randomness is in Buffett's failures, not his successes i.e., Buffett's deviation from the `norm' of his own outperformance `can' be explained by luck and randomness and not by any lack of skill. I have been working through these issues in a separate paper entitled, Is Warren Buffett a statistical anomaly? (Kelly, 2006). For instance, when Buffett started out as a funds manager in 1957 there were only 453 listed fund managers (Burton, 1968). The chances of anyone of these achieving the same kind of results as Buffett, by chance, are incredible remote (i.e., 0.0000050%). Perhaps I am however missing something about the underlying randomness of the environment that Buffett operates in that would allow Taleb and others to effectively dismiss him as chance occurring. Finally though, what I think Taleb misses is less important for me than what I think I miss and in that respect I am grateful to him for highlighting the inductive problem in thinking, the importance of qualitative assumptions in bets on probable and indeed improbable outcomes and how emotionally susceptible I am to being Fooled by Randomness.<br /><br />Edward Kelly
0439023513|1.0|You ever get the feeling that an author is having a bad day a work? Never since the Matrix movies have I seen a trilogy fall so flat on its face.... Wow. The best part about this book is that there is still time for the director to have the screen play rewritten before making the movie.

0340822783|5.0|I'd seen the movie first, which should have had Oscar nominations! I wanted to know more details. The movie was an incredible adaptation -- left some things out but changed very little. The ideas presented are largely dark, but very well done; the format is unusual & effective (switching back & forth between story lines) -- & despite all the darkness, the ultimate conclusive suggestions are positive. I do think the story used to end the movie (the latest chronologically) was more effective than the book (the earliest chronologically). I want to read his other books now.

0765325950|5.0|Really?!  I have been looking forward to this book. So, I log on to see a two plus star rating. Had to dig through a lot of stuff, but giving a book a poor review because you have to wait for the format you prefer is bad form. So, without reading the book, I will show bad form by giving it a 5 star reading.  Love the Wheel of Time series. Love my Kindle.  I will eagerly purchase the book in Kindle form when it is released in April. It's not a matter of price, I would happily pay today's price on the hardcover for a Kindle version. But, I will wait.  As someone else said, the industry has protocol on the way publishing takes place.  I don't hate a movie because I prefer to watch it on Netflix or Amazon Prime, and have to wait until it is through playing in the theaters. Wish those people that posted the 1 star would take them back, and just check that they would like to have a Kindle version (like I did a month ago).  Can we let the reviews reflect the quality of the story?  Update:  so I waited for the Kindle version, and this book deserves he 5 stars.  This is well written, and kept my attention to the end.  I am kind of sad it is the end of the series.

0761169253|4.0|There are two types of creative books in my experience. There are books that will give you practical creative techniques that you can actually use ([[ASIN:1580087736 Thinkertoys: A Handbook of Creative-Thinking Techniques (2nd Edition)]] and [[ASIN:0452273226 The Mind Map Book: How to Use Radiant Thinking to Maximize Your Brain's Untapped Potential]] for example), and there are books that mostly serve to motivate you to go create something (like [[ASIN:B007A4SDCG The War of Art]]).<br /><br />This book is a mix of both. Though I have read many of his practical techniques in other places, the material here is arranged well. The author has selected a nice mix of practical and motivational pieces, and the overall result is a book that will you will really enjoy.<br /><br />There is enough here that you will like, and it will take less than an hour to read.

B005LAII80|5.0|Wont drag this on. The directing is really good. A lot of style and 3d that is as good as it gets! The slo mo scenes are so euphoric and elegant amid this carnage ridden action slug fest. It's such a strange combination but it really works so perfectly. View this in 3d because really it isn't just a gimmick, it truly takes the film to the next level of how 3d can utilized to its real potential. Just a great movie. Buy it. It's a movie you'll watch more than once.

The biggest gripe I have is that the light really only comes out of the top 1/3 of the bulb.  If you have this in a lamp and expect it to provide an all around glow, it is not going to work.  Virtually no light comes out the sides.

I sincerely hope all TNG fans with BD capability will indulge themselves.  This is primo work.
B008476HBM|3.0|Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.<br />I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.<br />When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.<br />I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?<br />Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.<br />Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book. I will definitely be reading more of her books sooner than later.hat Lydia had run off with the right guy.

The book is very well written... allmost like, can be read in one time. Sometimes i did put the book aside for a few hours... to think things over. The (global) area where things all happened is not known by every reader... but internet made those (minor) details clear. Beyond this life... i've no experience... but Dr. Eben Alexander wrote about his wonderfull and beautifull experience. Because of reading the book i understand a little more about life after this life... but also about why living now and knowing a bit better what to do with life now.

0375701427|5.0|This is Philip Roth's best book! If you have not read it yet, put it on your list. It deals with life & aging.<br />Seriously, it's one of my Top 5 of All Time! It also won the Pulitzer Prize. It will really get one thinking...
B0084U0IEG|3.0|It was a fun read that could be tedious at times. Overall I enjoyed reading it but it is not the type of book I would enjoy reading twice. I loved Atonement so maybe my expectations were too high!
B003O86FMW|5.0|A+++ I recommend this book. I believe all will enjoy it. I am going to read the next book in the series.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I typically fall asleep during movies but I stayed awake because it was so good. The characters were so adorable and it made for great family time.
1475143389|5.0|I have been seriously trying to lose weight for a little over a year know, we'll I thought I was serious about it. I had lost a little over 20lbs in 8 months or so when I started to read Bigger Leaner Stronger. After reading this book and putting the advise to use, I have lost a total of 53lbs. Eight months - 20lbs, 5 months of BLS diet and 5 days/wk of interval cardio - 33lbs.<br /><br />Bottom line, this stuff works. It's not too hard to follow the diet recommendations once you get the hang of it. The weight training is challenging, but not too hard to start at any level. I have recommended this book to everyone who asked me how I lost all the weight.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating since I find this book very interesting and it's really enjoyable. Can't wait to read the next book!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is a really good game I like that the hint are right there when you need them. I have never paid for game and I'm still not sure if I'm going to pay for. this 1 but I'm may.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great on my kindle fire and I love how many levels are in this one also I love the challenge of the bigger playing field.... the hubby and I stayed up til 8am playing this lol it's very addictive!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I always love playing mahjong tiles and was happy to see it for the kindle fire. I can play for hours! The one thing I wasn't used to was how it scrambles the tiles until you match them all automatically. Also have to get used to what tiles go with each other and how small it is on the screen. But overall a good game app for the kindle fire.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|This is definitely the new batman, modernized, and very cool. The canon shooter things were a hit, though in my household those pieces are always lost by day two.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This is a great movie. I will b adding this to my collection of Tinkerbell movies. This is my favorite one yet.
B004K7HMJ6|1.0|Urgh.. I bought this CD after hearing Do it Like a Dude (still one of my top songs), Nobody's Perfect and Who You Are and it all went rapidly downhill after that. After listening to the first few tracks on the CD I realised one thing - I really can't stand her voice!! It's so shouty and over-exagerated and grates on me big time. And the only songs worth listening to are the single - the rest are badly written and have little meaning. I'd reccomend you check it out on youtube before buying or face making the same mistake I did and end up carting it down the charity shop! :D
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am just now getting into Evermore, but I like what I see so far.  Easy to use and it does help keep me organized. I can't wait to unlock all the possibilities.
B006ZZAMWK|1.0|Seriously, is it really necessary for these tools to release an album about every month (and if it isn't, then it seems like they do!!)? I'm just counting down the days all the nursery's stop playing this CD on rotation and most of this manufactured-to-every-inch-of-it's-life band fan base will forget about them - seriously, Justin Bieber has gone up in my estimation since these wannabe's came out, I can actually look at his face without wanting to punch him! :D
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I love the first song on this CD, but I can't remember the other songs on this CD.  I recomend buying the MP3 files of the songs you like, and leaving the rest.<br /><br />Will look forward to the next album, and I could see them in a smoky bar sometime - that would be cool.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|The only problem I have with Katy Perry is it's been 3 years and there's still no sign of another CD! I love this album, it's fun, easy to listen and have a sing-song to and it just put's me in a good mood! Yes, it is as as poppy as you can get but pop it in the CD player on a sunny day and chill in the garden and I can guarantee you'll love it! The only song I skip is Peacock because it sounds like some cheerleader chant. It's got the fun songs: California Girls, Last Friday Night, Teenage Dream etc.. but it's also got some really meaningful songs such as Firework, Who am I Living For? and Not Like The Movies. Would recommend this to anyone! :D
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Ever get a CD from start to finish that's entertaining?  Well, this is one of mine, I love these guys.  It's one of those CDs I don't listen to too much for fear of being burned out.  I listen to them on occasion, and love the album when I do break it out. Kind of like a fine beer - too much is too much, but this album once in a while is very nice.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Love this movie. It's a Christmas classic!  We cut the cord so collecting special Christmas movies for the season and keeping them on rotation is better than flipping through channels looking for seasonal shows
B0087JTAKW|4.0|4 stars because 5 is virtually perfect and no one on earth is perfect.<br />Anyone able to read, I recommend this story. It provides a worthy, emotional and thought-provoking lesson. Dob<br />.
B000UDJS2S|1.0|Beware... This film combines Nicholas Cage's lack of acting talent with a terrible script. The results are disastrous. I read the comic book a few times back in the eighties, so I was familiar with the story of Ghost Rider, but not particularly a fan. I do remember enough to know that they could have made a decent film with the content.
B004NNUZ5K|4.0|This is a very good book on the nuts and bolts of mixing, written by the person responsible for each month's Mix Rescue column in Sound on Sound magazine. Mike Senior has impeccable credentials and years of experience in crafting mixes. And that shows through in the book. However, for all I wanted to, I could only give this book four stars. Why?<br /><br />The book is well-written, but the prose varies between very technical and familiar styles. It feels like his editors came in at the end and said, \\"Mike, this is a great manuscript here, but it seems technical and cold. Could you tart it up with a few colloquial expressions? A bit of badinage?\\" In the end, it makes the book feel a bit wonky.<br /><br />I'm not sure that the idea of \\"multing\\" tracks is a good one any more, leading to the possibility of phasing issues if parts of duplicated tracks aren't muted properly. These days, with most DAWs supporting addition of effects in segments of tracks, it's not necessary to mult to add an effect or an EQ to a particular section of the song - clip the track and add the effects you want to the clipped segment (I know that Sonar, Cubase, and Reaper support this - maybe you still have to mult in ProTools, but they're *always* behind the times).<br /><br />Similarly, I'm not positive that the notion of \\"fader stability\\" is a great one either. It's an interesting approach to telling if the mix is good, but in the end, it may be more of a distraction than an essential.<br /><br />That being said, the rest of the book, full of good advice on the nuts and bolts of the mixing process, is quite nice. So it doesn't hit 5 stars, just 4. Even so, it's well worth the price and this book should be part of anyone's production library.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|Best multi-tool out there for the price. Nice solid build, strong metal all around. Packaging could use a little updating, it was made of some pretty cheap plastic.
B0085YNML2|1.0|this game is so boring that I cant even stay awake playing this game!<br />just NEVER EVER EVER get this game
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game to work at getting better running away and getting coins.<br />I know there is way more things to come in Temple Run...bring it on!
B0017I1FNK|5.0|This album lives up to her high standards.  I believe I have all her albums, plus some that she guested on.  An amazing talent, though no longer popular with the &#34;modern&#34; country fans.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time! Great book for reminiscing about the 80's. Great character development. You feel like you know the characters. Just a great read.
0765325950|5.0|I received my copy 2 days ago. I am reading it now. I love these books and feel that B Sanderson honors Robert Jordans vision. I have read and re-read these books at least 5 times over the last 20 years. They have been a great part of my life. I am disappointed that I can't read the e-book on my Kindle as that is more convenient. On a side note I thought the kindle version was out, because as of last night there was a copy on various sites on the internet. I was just googling and found it was on bittorrent sites. So has it been released elsewhere for sale?
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It is difficult to change an alarm setting once you' ve set it.  I  need something easier to set.  I could also use a timer with it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|my son says: A collection of the only good Batman movies, is very rare you should get while you can.
B000JQV68A|3.0|A love/hate experience.  Glad I read it, but also glad to finish it. The characters are aggravating and the story seems irrelevant.  However, it's by F. Scott Fitzgerald - and the man can write.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I give it 5 star because it the beatles and I've collect them sense 1995 and I feel like I'm starting over again which is a good thing I'm starting a hobby of collecting vinyl and this is a good starting point and fun to do as well and can't wait to collecting vinyl down the road because I like music.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|fun fun fun it is simply addictive And very interseting there is always someything to do. tries to suck you in with money and social media though.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I ENJOYED this fantasy very much and thought worthy of high rating.  I particularly enjoyed the unique approach to the people and history of the land of Oz.  I also felt the story's storyline regarding the effect of believing in oneself having the effect of making it true.  OUR minds have great power if we would only believe it.  I also liked the emphasis on good being more powerful than evil.
B001974DG0|5.0|Best one so far! Made me cherish my dog even more. She won't be like Einstein, but she's a smart one too. Very protective. Will read again and again. Thumbs up!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie. My kids love it and so do I. We can't wait for Despicable Me 2 to come out.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great story. Finished the book in 3 days. Can't wait to see the movie. I recommend this book to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Compared to other solitaire programs, this one is easier to use and more fun to play. The cards are moved to their places with just a touch, eliminating the tedious need to always drag them into place. The undo feature reverses your moves all the way back to the beginning if need be, as a teaching tool. The auto finish feature saves time allowing you to move on to your next game quickly after you have obviously won. Great app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the rest of the series - and watch the movie again! Let's get started asap !
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Great first album from alt-J. Very unique. I've listened to it several times and still love almost every song. Even the interludes and the intro work nicely to tie the album together.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Wish it was easier to earn coins on here or games cost less coins. The games I have played have been fun.
0316069434|5.0|Have enjoyed the entire Harry Bosch series ever since picking up my first used paperback at a Friends of the Library outlet. Soon started looking for other Connelly novels. Paid full freight for The Black Box in hardback, and did so gladly, because I couldn't wait to catch the latest action.
B00000K31V|1.0|I really wasted my money on this item and the only reason why I got it is because it said that this movie was better than the Matrix Reloaded, well, someone lied to me, at least I was able to trade it back in to amazon for something...
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Best musical soundtrack! I would highly recommend purchasing this album.  It is utterly amazing with the actors voices and the story
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|the book reminded me of a drive from Manitoba to Alberta, flat and repetative. A nice begining, with a boring middle, and a beautiful finish.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app. Love all the features. Never thought I would pay for a battery app but it was well worth it.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Anorher great kevin James movie I can watch with family and friends it was a classic great movie and a cast of awesome actors that can't be bad at all
1932073221|5.0|No explanation is required.  The headings speak for themselves.  These are simply beautiful affirmations.  They work, too.  I refer to them often for different situations in my life.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I would highly recommend  I had a great time playing Finished in one sitting Very creepy good  good smoothie graphics nice music
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy playing mahjong and this game is particularly nice because when I get 'stuck' it will let me 'reshuffle' the remaining tiles.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is something like Jewels in that you can get lost in it.  The time will get away from you.  I really enjoy it and my husband enjoys it as well.  That is a success story for any game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series. Enjoyed it. Would recommend.<br />Need to go back and reread the first one now just to refresh.<br />Suspenseful.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another great book by my favorite author. I haven't finished it yet, but so far it's exciting and informative, just like all of his previous works.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Only reason Looper does not get 5 stars is because I am not a big fan of sequels and I like flashbacks and (spoiler) if the main character is dead in the present and past, there will be no flashback! Also, I saw it in theaters not on dvd.
B0099114WO|3.0|I thought it was going to be a comedy, if so, not my type of comedy.  Too real to be funny.
B006S08RLU|5.0|It really kept my attention and gave me many laughs. I'm quite impressed and plan to buy the DVD for my home collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so fun! But of course this is my opinion. I think everyone should try it out and its free so its easier! If u dont like it jusy delete it!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a wonderfully written book that gets you into the Christmas spirit and teaches a great lesson about generosity
B005P3NPXG|5.0|We've been following Seal for a number of years and we we're blown away by his renditions of old classics....like 'What's Goin On' and 'Love TKO'  This is a great album to buy if you're over 45 and love great music!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I have to say that Season 5 of Castle is the Best yet. There is a lot of story lines that have opened up that has made this show an exciting Season for me. This show has a Great Cast and the Leads Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic are so Charismatic together that they are so much fun to watch On Screen. The rest of the case are Amazing too. There are some things I want to see more of but overall I'm very satisfied with the progress that has been made. I've been watching this show since Season 1 and I will definitely continue.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|there isn´t much that I can say about this particular movie, aside that once you hit the play button in 1080p is WOW!!!!
B000YMQI6E|4.0|pros: Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling make this movie great.<br />cons: The plot is somewhat predictable but still nicely put together
B0034G4P26|5.0|It cannot go wrong, love the animation, the quality of the film and is great fun for  children and adults
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I rented this because the movie created such a hype but I thought it was just a very average and predictable story. Not really worth the money. Jennifer Lawrence is good though..
B009KHDT0C|5.0|this is a great movie. I use to watch the old series with my mother years and years ago. very funny and weird show.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|good game to pass time with. I will recommend it to anyone.  I think it needs more levels to play longer.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|my kids love this movie. there is no age that should not like this. I am older and still enjoyed this.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is so fun and we really enjoy playing it! Love seeing how high we can get before we have to start over!
B0063IH60K|1.0|The actual game was fun and I loved it but as soon as I was done with my first game and tried to play a second game an aggressive message popped up with a dating match-up proposal message.  There was no way to end it and go back to the game except to turn off my tablet completely and restart.  Then I was able to play one more game and it happened again.  I ended up deleting the entire Amazon Android app store off my tablet.  I was sorry to see it go because the Solitaire game itself was enjoyable with neat sounds etc. I haven't had a problem with any of my other many apps on my Galaxy Tablet, only that one.  It was the first one I've downloaded from that &#34;store&#34;.  I have no problems with the Amazon.com site on my regular home computer.  I hate to give bad news but there it is.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just like playing mario bros so you will love ... must download as a app!! My kids love it also ..
B000AJIF4E|5.0|YOU SIMPLY CAN'T BEAT THESE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE. SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE IS TRUE. BEST FOR SMALL STUDIO RECORDING TYPES.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|There has not been a movie in quite a while that could match the Sister Act trilogy but Pitch Perfect has done it. A great movie with a lot of talented actors and actresses. Would love to see more of these types of movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book.  Lots of action.  Kept me interested all the way through.  Cannot wait until Book 2 comes out.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. It was very uplifting and well written.I enjoyed it very much.Proof of<br />Heaven is and inspiring read.
0345525558|4.0|If you're a gardener, this book will pull you in and keep your attention all the way through.  I liked the Victorian list of flower meanings the author included.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book. Another winner! Couldn't put it down. I even bought copies for holiday presents for family Grisham fans.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|We purchased this CD on Amazon as it was received b-4 even being available in Stores-none of our Local Businesses even carry what they consider &#34;The Devil's Music&#34;. As a 46 yr old mother of 2 teens, I see nothing wrong with the BVB,nor their Lyrics or music-The Bible Belt (where we live) and their so-lld Miniaters need to &#34;get with the times&#34;!
B004GVUPFE|3.0|After loading the game I started playing it.  I was able to play through all the levels very fast.  I wish it were a bit more challenging.  Otherwise, good game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the read and the author did a great job of weaving truth and warning into a fictional construct in the same vein as The Prince to convey her message. Don't know if I like the idea of young kids reading it though.
B003YL4L0W|3.0|The characters Jodi created were outstanding in this novel, and I just wish I could have learned more about them to after the conclusion of it.  The storyline also proved that much more could have been told our included, but the room for imagination she left was also pretty fun!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great, what an awesome story of a woman's struggle to start over an  the place  she finds herself.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I loved the first season, the second season has surprised me so far. Worth watching, cant wait for season 3!
B0098WWEH8|4.0|The first couple of times I heard this album, it sort of whizzed past me with brevity. But, each time I heard it, it seemed to \\"unpack\\" more and more in my brain. Now, when I listen to it, it's more like a never-ending epic saga. One thing that hasn't changed, is the strangeness of this album. Of course it's just some mellow music, so it's not like it's too strange. I just mean that their other albums are more similar to each other, but this one stands out. This is mainly because the tones and vocal textures find new spaces to inhabit. The tone colors seem to draw from some entirely new palettes.<br /><br />I first fell in love with Yellow House. After a few listens, I realized that what at first seemed sort of folksy, was actually more like golden era Pink Floyd. I used to listen to a lot of folksy and hippie type music years ago, but now I mainly listen to the electronic side of indie rock or rap, and yet I adore Grizzly Bear. Vecatimest was a direct extension of Yellow House for me, but in general they seem to have started with a certain dusty/nostalgic/atmospheric feeling, on Yellow House, and gradually branched out into more vibrant hues and shades. I only give this 4 stars because I prefer Yellow House, but by the same token, I would not want just another Yellow House. Shields is great, and certainly not without some haunts of it's own.<br /><br />Buy it! These guys are rad!
B0000683DH|4.0|Did not disappoint - thoroughly enjoyed the extras - Designing Khan, Captain's Log and Interviews.  A great cast and production and seeing the background made it all the more enjoyable.
B003N7GATM|3.0|This is the sort of song collection that you put in your iPod to shuffle with your industrial and trip hop collection, but it's not really vital or anything. If you plan to buy all of Trent Reznor's music, then stop reading and buy this, but it's clearly not an example of his \\"top shelf\\" work. It's just mostly good.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|When I ordered the DVD I didn't pay close enough attention to  realize it didn't come in the original case... My own fault. I received the DVD in a timely manner, it was in great condition and it came in a new disk case. I was happy with my purchase and everything :)
B0074EIQQU|4.0|This might be their best album, but their output is so exhausting that it's hard to tell. No amount of side-projects can seem to slow them down either. Oh well, at least I can tell that this is really good. If you just now heard of them, this is a great introduction. These songs are very palatable in their length and their lack of extreme departures into freeform jazz-rock aesthetics. This is a very prolific group, sometimes to a fault.
B00333NCTM|5.0|When I listened to Ozzy on the radio I knew he had been through a lot, but a lot is an understatement. This book not only made me laugh, it also taught me how devastating hard drugs can be.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I don't listen to this too much with other people. I prefer to listen to it alone in headphones or while cooking. At first I didn't like Super Rich Kids and a few other songs in the middle section, but I always listen through to the whole thing usually, and those songs that bug me are just part of the whole masterpiece. My favorite song is Pyramids. You should just stop reading this right now and go watch the epic Pyramids video on Youtube instead, then come back and buy this. My second favorite song is Pink Matter. This album has an \\"exposed\\" feeling that makes some people feel uncomfortable. I don't listen to too much R&B, but this album has haunted my brain. The songs are so memorable. Frank Ocean is a young Stevie Wonder. I hope he turns out to be equally prolific.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wow, if anyone reads this book the Patriotism in their heart will ignite. As the story goes on Mark Owen is one of the most respectable people you will ever hear about. Remember what true sacrifices these men have made.
B0033AGPF8|5.0|I can't really comment on the packaging or sound quality of this particular run, but hopefully no one is reading this review to decide if this is a good album. If so: give me a break, you can't be serious; of course this is an amazing album! Why would you doubt it? I have the original vinyl version and it's pure magic. I don't know which Hendrix album is best; are there any bad ones? I don't think so.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I downloaded this product assuming  I can use it with my Kindle Fire but message says it does not work with Kindle and I don't need it since I already have 2 other email programs on my Kindle that work and I had no issues with them so far
1451695195|5.0|This is coming from a neurosurgen who understands brain function.  His experience is profound and it discounts any idea that the brain was just having a vivid dream.
B008476HBM|5.0|An English classic which needs no introduction or explanation! Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!
B000MRA5EM|1.0|my DVD did not work at all. That is why I am in the process of returning it, and there are no extra DVD's to replace the one that I ordered. (IMAX; Deep Sea).
