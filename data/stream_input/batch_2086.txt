B00683JK9K|4.0|Luckily I form my own opinions and don't base it on others, otherwise I would not have downloaded it. I had no problems with the puzzle at all. It could have more puzzles for a paid app, but it worked just fine and the graphics were nice.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I first found out about this book from Family Guy, lol.  It is jam packed with a lot of good information.  I absolutley love it.  Richard Dawkins is the man!
B00006JU7T|5.0|Al Pacino is at his best, protraying Frank Serpico and brings him to life on the screen.  A must watch if you are a Pacino fan or are interested in learning a bit about Frank Serpico.
B00B935SUY|5.0|One of the best music docs I've seen.  You follow the journey of a sound board through the life of a studio and in the process see popular music history being made.  Groundbreaking records from Fleetwood Mac in the 70's, Tom Petty in the 80's, and Nirvana in the 90's demonstrate why this place and this Neve console was so important to Rock N Roll.  Highly Recommended!!<br /><br />Also, the best line of the movie comes late in the 3rd act from Sir Paul McCartney, \\"It is.\\"
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This is a prime example of an action movie executed perfectly. Every facet is just right. The dialog is simple but effective, the action sequences have just the right amount of flair, and in general nothing is over done. I'm sorry that I missed supporting this movie when it was in theaters.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|when I first got the game I was very excited about it. but after playing for a week the game stopped working. amozon should Check that out
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a app that makes you think. I would recamend this app. its free so give it a try..
1603429999|3.0|When I got this book, I was really excited. I had heard a lot of good things about it. However, I have found it to be disappointing.<br /><br />If you are going to include patterns within an instructional section of the book, make sure that you specify what part of the text is the pattern, and what part isn't. And if you're going to have one pattern start at a certain point of a previous pattern, be VERY clear, or just put in the duplicate instructions anyways.<br /><br />Don't say that something is complicated to explain, and then proceed to give very little instruction on how to do it.<br /><br />The author appears to be writing to an audience who they must assume know exactly what they are talking/writing about without a great deal of explanations. This is a good book if you already know what you are doing, or if you already have a lot of experience with circular knitting. If you, like myself, have limited knowledge and understanding of the ins and outs of circular knitting, PLEASE go and find a different book!
0811870413|5.0|This book is amazing, and beautiful.  The pictures, the stories.  I read it over and over.  It's beautifully bound, and just holding it feels nice.  My copy is covered in flour.  this should be necessary reading for home and professional bakers as well.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|again not sure why could not find it once it was purchased on the tablet must not have been compatible
1452101248|4.0|this book is beautiful.  I love it and already own a copy, and find inspiration from it every time I cook.  The recipes are pretty simple, with a fresh take on the ingredients ( especially in the Midwest in the Winter.)  It arrive later then the projected time, which normally is not a huge issue, but was for a time sensitive affair.  I blame Chicago mail service.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|again not sure why could not find it once it was purchased on the tablet must not have been compatible
B0049IWQJW|4.0|The only complaint I have about this movie was the volume- it was either VERY loud or way too quiet depending on what was happening.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|must not be compatible with this tablet could not find this after it said it had been purchased not sure why
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|In this novel, we follow Jamie and Claire, having rescued Ian,  in their venture in North Carolina. Vivid descriptions of life in the colony bring history to life. Bree joins her parents, and Roger follows Bree. Add a dash or two or piracy, lost treasure and you have a great read!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I haven't played it much but when I did it was okay like any other solitaire game but it helps when your bored
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to play . And it's even free. Cards are easy to see and I've never had a problem with game like getting frozen.
B008XG1X18|1.0|again not sure why could not find it once it was purchased on the tablet must not have been compatible
B00365EVWE|5.0|Great bass and good fit. Changes the sound of music a bit. Wires dont tangle up and the three different ear sizes help fit into the ear canal.
B009UWYFFK|3.0|This is a good movie. My 6 yr old realy likes it. However, towards the begining of the movie, when the boy shows up to check in, he says, \\"I can't F-ing breath under here\\" when he is under all the suit cases. I had to replay it several times to believe what I was hearing.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Plus, it has an audio commentary track that is one continuous musical. How awesome is that? Few authors can make me laugh and cry in the same minute. Joss Whedon can.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|Each season keeps getting better than the season before.  The show is very funny and keeps me very interested in every episode.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|A great story like Dark Knight Returns gets a two-part treatment, and just like Part 1, Part 2 is just as great to watch, even with some parts that got cut out of the adaptation (like Joker's \\"kiss of death\\" with the Dr. Ruth Westeinheimer expy). Again Peter Weller voices the older Batman, and I'm surprised to notice Justice League's Maria Canals voicing his pursuant Commissioner Ellen Yindel, who at first sees Batman as a menace but then realizes her predecessor Jim Gordon's words, that he's just \\"too big\\". Superman comes into the picture to try reining Batman back into silent compliance with the government, but that doesn't go over too well for a man who best works in the shadows and tries to avoid being front-page news even as the press still continues to report his activities. And of course, the Joker comes out of retirement for one last go-round with the Dark Knight, seeing how far he will push his nemesis to ultimately killing him.<br /><br />As with Part 1, the animation and artwork is excellent, as a sort of mix between the original comic book style and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. It's definitely worth a purchase if you're into Batman.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I choose this rating because I loved it was so fun to read.I think any one would love this book.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I usually like sequels, and thought I would really like this one because the first 3 were so good. But this was slow, boring, and just not interesting. A very ineffective transition from the previous movies in the series, and poor continuity. The cast was dull, just punching a time clock to eek out one more movie.  I tried to like it, but was disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever you guys have to try it I really love it so come on tell them what you think.I really love this game and I hope you love it to
B000077VR3|5.0|this is easily one of my favorite movies and when i couldn't find it at walmart, target, or netflix, i was devastated! thank you amazon for always having exactly what i need when i need it. and the price was a steal for the perfect condition the DVD was in! (:
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a book, bought & couldn't put it down, even reading it at work!  Can't wait to start on the next one.  Five stars for sure...recommended it to all my friends at work!
0321701763|3.0|I jumped the gun on this one. Did not think that kindle edition would be sans lesson disk. These titles usually help me learn the subject material in the most efficient way for me. This book is likewise helpful.
0143112724|3.0|Overall it was a bit more beat up than I expected but still use-able. Worth the price I paid for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A fun time filler with no glitches and simple enough to play profficiently in little time.No need for thinking or tactics.Ideal for passing a few minutes.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Great story. If you are a Rankin fan, you will love it. We've been waiting for the old crew to come back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I own a horse my self and this game is the closest you will get to raising a horse online hope my review is help
B008O037RG|5.0|I wish i could have gotten the Deluxe edition on vinyl!<br />Oh well.<br />Sounds amazing! love the band and the music!<br /><br />The album may not be as good as their first one, but it's still very much worth the listen if your a fan.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love keeping up with everyone including he celebrities!! I would love for more of my friends to be on Twitter tweeting with me.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|Great album, great songs, great band.<br />The vinyl is good, clean, sounds great!<br /><br />Cons: none<br />Pros: Great music sound quality is excellent
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book was a good book it was so good that I finished in a hour.:) ;)<br /><br />Ashley Gallegor<br /><br />Cabin Fever
B005MYWZKM|3.0|I love the band, great music. Maybe not their best album but it's still great music.<br /><br />The vinyl came clean and undamaged with no warping. Thanks amazon!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book reads as if it is taking place, And will be knocking on my front door any day.<br />I bought it expecting a light read with a few laughs. When I finally Forced my eyes Close at 3 o'clock the following morning my mind was still popping with zombies. Excellent read
B007885IJU|5.0|Love it on vinyl, sounds great!<br />The vinyl came clean, undamaged and wasn't warped. Thanks amazon!<br /><br />Great music and band. if you like them on MP3 then give em a try on Vinyl!
B009IA9OLE|1.0|This is a dreadful boring game.  It does have quirky characters, but as far as game play it is the equivalent of watching paint dry.  Save your money.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|Sounds great on vinyl!<br />When i first listened to it the first track has an effect on the voices that makes it sound like there is clipping happening. I thought it was my set up, I ended up getting a new table (not because of that) but it sounded the same on the new one so i'm certain it is just the way it was made. (it's much less noticeably on the other tracks.)<br /><br />I love this album though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Kept my interest to a<br /><br /> point where I had a difficult time putting it down.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Best 'Harry Bosch' so far!! (and I've read them all!)<br /><br />Way to go - Michael Connelly!<br /><br />Have been and will continue to be a life-long fan.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book I've ever read<br /><br />Greg is truly a wimpy kid.<br />I mean he send 20 messages to a girl
B008XCJ03K|3.0|Very good album that I bought after listening to one track on Pandora.  Problem is that it is too mellow.  Not enough variation on the tracks as they all sound slow and depressing.  Still a good effort and worth it on a digital sale or other...
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This movie was fun!  Great family movie with relevant and easy to understand themes.  Enough to keep parents entertained, as well as kids.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Its interesting. I've watched the brothers kill the yellow eyed demon, Lillith, Famin, pestilence, war, negotiate with death, capture Micheal and the devil and stop the apocalypse several times and I always think, \\"How are they going to top this?\\"  and they always do. This season is more introspective that apocalyptic,  but I look forward to every show.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I though t it was lots of fun! I loved the music, especially in the last scene! I watched it twice.
B0059F7I24|5.0|Always loved Trivium, but it seemed their sound was getting more &#34;pop&#34; than metal. I say this because they started playing them on other stations (doesnt mean much, but still). Anyway, I decided to get this finally, and wish I got it sooner.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you like any of Trivium's other music, pick this up ASAP.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|I believe it has only been a week that I owned this product, but it doesn't charge anymore nor power on.<br /><br />When it was working it brought life to my various gadgets. My sources were Lenovo Thinkpad laptop (aux), Nokia 920 phone (aux) and PS3 (optical). My outputs were: Pioneer SE MJ 591, and Creative Labs 2.1 t3030.<br /><br />On the laptop, it sounded better connecting via aux on my laptop instead of USB. I think the reason was because my laptop was already running 24 bit 192khz, so aux input would just amplify the quality. When I used USB, it was downgraded to 24 bit 96 khz.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sound<br />-Build finish and packaging<br />-Simple User Interface<br /><br />Cons<br />-Poor durability (did not last even a month and it stayed on my desk only)
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Nice and easy read, also motivating to get you out for a run.<br />Recipes are healthy and simple to make.
030758836X|5.0|Flynn's attention to detail is astounding. Her ability to articulate the thoughts of so many men and women in a marriage is uncanny. And then.. she takes it somewhere else. Where, you'll have to read and find out for yourself. But I promise, it will be a thrilling endeavor.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|this is the better trilogy about Batman that I see in my life. I'm very satisfied with this movie and suggest the buy to others Batman's fans.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the first two crossfire novels, can't wait for the third! The relationship between Eva and Gideon is like a rollercoaster! I love the ups and downs, keeps me drawn in!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Really excelent. Avatar changes the way of enjoy a fiction movie. Two thumbs up! I'm very satisfied by this item
B007SGM084|4.0|Great read, great book, looks great. My wife loved it so much that she showed me just how much she loved it.
1592537251|5.0|Inspiring! Full of illustrations from around the world in many artistic styles with short stories and the drawing tools used for each one. Beautifully laid out, interesting to read, just a very nice book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is addictive because its so much fun. its ten times better than the first temple run.I cant wait for the third one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun. I can not get enough of it. I play it all the time.
B00005OCMR|5.0|this is a great movie from my childhood.  i loved it back in the 80s and still love it today
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love the game but the update hasn't come out on the kindle and it is annoying my sister cant get the update and now I cant play with her until it comes out please come out with it it is a really fun game though
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We loved this movied!! Really cute and streaming through with my prime was great!!!!! Thnak you Amazon! again... Will order more soon!
0446547573|5.0|This book truly offers a great romance. For not being a big reader of romance novels, Nicholas Sparks nailed it. He crafted a way of grabbing the reader in and making sure to get emotions and reactions out. This novel truly made me happy, sad and mad at times which is key to enjoying it. Please read this book, can't wait for the movie now!
B000H30B2C|4.0|I liked the quality of the dvd and extended version.<br />I wish this would had that choice of viewing full screen or letterbox.<br />I prefer full screen movies.<br /><br />.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its amazing but the only problem I have are the bugs and there are no mines. Regardless, this game is sick! Not as good as the Pc version obviously.
B001N8V7KA|4.0|Considering that this movie is dated to before the fall of the Soviet empire and involves a &#34;state of the art&#34; plane, it is still a very good action thriller.  A must have for any Eastwood fan.
B00999DFP0|5.0|Loved this. Received all the DVD's quickly and with no problems. Would recommend using this same buying option to anyone.
B006885FZI|5.0|Epic story of the war in Japan! The cinematography was was classic and the graphic violence was realistic and sad. I really enjoyed how the film dealt with the human reaction to the horrific violence and sense of hopelessness. I was especially saddened at how war affected the individual psyche of the participants and how it carried over into the personal lives of those who survived. It stripped the romanticism of war and showed what real war was like.
B003297I1U|5.0|We gave this to my son for his 5th birthday, and he loves it.  It's his favorite toy.  It's a plastic toy but seems very durable.  The hook is actually metal, which my son really likes, and it can really lift heavy things.  It's expensive, but I think it will be played with for a very long time.
B000T46O52|5.0|I wanted to watch this movie due to a project on my health class. I thought it gonna be a boring movie but i was surprise becaus  It is an awasome movie.
B0071F3T0K|1.0|Was so looking forward to this work from one of the most acclaimed American writers of all time.  By the time my Kindle reached 11% I had to surrender.  It was a dull rendering of even duller characters written by a writer who, IMHO, came across as if he was already bored with life.  Remove the &#34;Hemingway&#34; name and let the work stand on it's own merits...it is simply not entertaining.  I might give it another try some other day but I doubt it: life's too short.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great writing and great acting.  Cast selection was also excellent. I also bought season 2.  the review required all these words.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is fun but there are still a lot if glitches. I've played it both on the kindle and my iPhone and it has the same problems on both. Once fixed I would rate it higher!
030759565X|3.0|While there are a number of things I like about this cookbook, such as helpful photos of each recipe and measurements also provided in weights (very important for baking accuracy, ultimately it would just collect dust on my cookbook shelf.<br /><br />Why?  These recipes just are not practical for everyday cooks.  They seem tailored only to foodies with large and very hungry households who have easy access to fresh and specialty ingredients.  The recipes use many ingredients that are acquired tastes.  I will eat just about anything remotely classified as \\"food\\", but few people are like me.  They won't eat the goat cheese or dill, provided I can find it in a local grocery store, and won't even touch chicken cooked with grapes.  The majority of these recipes cannot be halved, do not last long enough for me to eat myself before they go bad, or cannot be frozen and saved for later.  This cookbook would only be useful if I were hosting a dinner party for foodie friends.<br /><br />Some of the recipes I tried were good, but to some extent not worth the expense or effort.  They are often unnecessarily overdone.  The brownie cutouts were pretty decent, but I'd have rather had a truly great drop cookie.  I liked the idea of a simplified brioche, but the recipe is made complex and turned into a pretzel, and then chocolate chips are added, spoiling the simple flavor of the brioche.  Why?<br /><br />Some recipes were failures.  The apple cake was terrible.  It was so eggy and oily that I barely noticed the apples.  The black bean recipe, despite her claims that it cooks in a few hours in a slow cooker, was awful.  I prefer soft beans, not crunchy ones.  I finally had to cook them on the stovetop for an hour to just get them to stop tasting raw.<br /><br />These recipes are also expensive to make and not practical for anyone on a budget.  Ms. Perelman says in her intro that she tried not to use hard-to-find ingredients, but I live in a big city and couldn't find cranberry beans or fresh peas at 3 stores before I gave up.<br /><br />Also, JACOB JACOB JACOB JACOB JACOB.  Yes, she does write about her kid a lot when I wish she would write about the recipes, but there are only a few small photos of him.  It's the same level of mild annoyance of meeting a stranger on an elevator who won't shut up and stop showing you pictures of their offspring.  It is not as bad as some other reviews described.  In fact, it's nothing compared to the ersatz Pioneer Woman cookbook that has more pictures of confused children and cows than of food.<br /><br />I applaud the creativity and variety of recipes, and again kudos on the excellent format, but for me this will not be anything other than an attractive book to flip through on occasion.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|No extra features, but it has all the movies in a nice compact movie box, they played and looked great.  It was exactly what I wanted at a price that made me  happy too.  :)  Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending wasn't the happy conclusion I thought it was going to be. However the series that began with the hunger games left me adequately satisfied.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very easy but useful tool. It works properly with my Kindle Fire HD. Nothing to complain ...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good reading & suspense.  Didn't figure out what was going on until late in the book.  Another good John Grisham story.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I can not say enough good things about this show. The characters are so easy to follow and you really become quite interested in their lives. The show, in my opinion, is never dull and never has that &#34;c'mon already!&#34; feeling to it. Keeps you watching and truly does become addicting!
B00APJLX8E|1.0|When I watch a movie, especially pay per view ones, my connection to amazon breaks at least half dozen times.  Very annoying!  I would hope that with a 30mbit connection and no other downloads going this would not happen.<br /><br />Movie 3 stars<br />Amazon service 1 star
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is a great ending to the series. I like that the author tied up all loose ends with the characters and that the ending was a decent one.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have always struggled to fall asleep in a noisy household. This app made it not only possible but easy. Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have had no problems with this game. Great graphics. Good way to pass the time but not tons of repeated moves.
032147404X|4.0|This is another good book about photography. A lot of good tips about your camera and how to use it. This book leads you into a series of four books so far. I recommend this book.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Bought this case for my neice for Christmas to keep her Kindle from it from getting scratches and when she drops it it won't break the screen.
1582701903|5.0|It gives you excellent insight into the power of consciousness and the proper use of it. I'm thinking of buying this book for my daughters. Good stuff!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicting It his game is the best ever I love my hubby he is the best man in the whole world
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What i like about this game is its creative and fun I like how they have different types of themes like Christmas and New York and Brazil it's so so so fun how they get faster than faster I love this game
B004WR125O|4.0|The only down side is that I can't turn on a Pandora station immediately after turning on the receiver.  Not sure why but it takes a good 30 seconds or so to make the connection and work.
1594745692|1.0|Received this a gift - threwit away....absolutely a waste of time, paper and the author's ability to write tarot is dismal. So is he personwho gave it to me - dismal. I wouldn't give this deck tomy deg to chew on.
1603425381|5.0|When I first purchased this book it was very in my crochet adventures... I was such a Newbie that I honestly bought this for the mere color stimulation... then it arrived and I was stunned by the ease of reading and following along on the instructions...<br />Since purchasing this book even my simplest projects are elevated by adding or combining any of these spectacular borders!!<br />I highly recommend this book regardless of your current level of crochet!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game a lot when I get home I play it. I finally got fresh he is my favorite.
B0068C9W44|5.0|I love Rihanna and I love this album! It is just what I need to get me up and moving!
B00003CXA2|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I have seen most Tom Hanks movies and I have really liked them a lot...This is a very heartwarming movie for the whole family...
0307341550|4.0|All I have to say is, messed Up! I have had this book on my to-read list for a very long time. It was advertised one of the book sites I frequent and the description was enough that I was curious. When I started this I didn't know what to think or what to expect for that matter. My wife decided to check this out as a possible book club pick and I figured it would be a good time to read it myself so we could talk about it. I always like talking over books with her and was just as interested in this as she was. I was not expecting what I got.<br /><br />This book has its ups and downs as most thrillers do. I chose to listen to this and I found myself tuning out from time to time so it was nice to have my wife help clue me in or say, go back and re-listen. There were times I was totally invested in the story and sometimes it was because I couldn't believe what I was reading. The characters are very well developed, but some of the actions are just appalling. I didn't know how to react at times, should I be disgusted or sad for this person, I was torn. Gillian Flynn does a great job with describing each character in a way you can understand. I may not have connected with every character but I at least knew where they stood and what they were all about.<br /><br />Having read quite a few mysteries I had a few characters pegged early on as to who the killer was. Even though I had thought this person was the killer I was miss-lead and still shocked when the reveal came. The twists and turns were worth the down spots and where I started out thinking this was going to be a solid 3 star review, by the end I had to give this 4 stars. I would say this isn't for every one but I thought it was a very good read.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This is a great starter set of Duplo animals. It comes with four nicely sized animals - giraffe, polar bear, elephant, and lion cub plus a female zookeeper. It has a grass piece, two flowers, five square pieces, and five long pieces, including a long clear blue piece. Minus the two flower pieces, all the pieces are large enough not to be choke hazards.<br /><br />Our 14 month old picked this set out himself at the Lego store and loves it. He makes noises with the animals and is learning their names. We paid $9.99 as of January 2013, and for the number and types of pieces, this set is a great buy at that price.<br /><br />:: posted by Rob's wife
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really really like this game. ot is just awesome. getitget it get it GET IT!!!!!! just do it.<br />l love it plead get it
B003Y5H542|5.0|La mejor pelicula animada de todos los tiempos. Es una tremenda opcion de regalo. La version blu-ray hace una experiencia diferente con esta pelicula.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Was a great read with likeable characters. Couldn't put it down even though I kept thinking this may be geared more towards teens. Great story line.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is great....you can combine sounds to get that perfect match and its all free...many choices...just a great app period.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I got it 4my littel grile and she didn't get it to work and hated it. I flet like I just killed a puppy trust me mom to mom don't get it 4your grile!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I am new to loving these types of action movies and this one is OVER THE TOP fantastic.  Love the actors/characters and after went and watched all the other movies of the individual heros.  The best is Iron Man - gotta love him!  GREAT movie - my 10 year old son watched it and I'm usually pretty protective over what he watches - a few things were a little violent but overall ok and he loved it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This  is a really fun game. It has an engaging storyline that keeps you coming back to play it. Worth a download.
1619491486|3.0|Why is it that academic types always think they are so above the mundane pleasures of lving??? What a bore!
B00000DRA9|4.0|I like the movie I also like the soundtrack very much. The instrumental music is a peaceful way to listen to music when you don't want to hear silence.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|I find this book to be trite and stereotypical. I am definitely not a fan! Stopped reading after a couple of chapters!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I can recommend Total Recall to anyone who liked the first film as well as any other sci-fi fan. The changes in this version compared to Arnie's really makes it feel like a different movie. Similar... but different. The action was there, the sci-fi was there, and of course the triple nipple was there! Really had me laughing at that.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo Blitz and have the app on my iPhone. I was very happy that it was offered on the Kindle
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Looper's storyline is fantastic. I wish it had more on the timelines though. Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails it again. It is really hard for me to not like movies he is in.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|It was a good book and kept me interested. Just a little disappointed in the ending. I would recommend it.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|This is a fun App.  It reminds me of the PC game &#34;RC Copter&#34;.  This feels like you are controling a RC but not as complicated as the real thing.  Lot of obsticales and challenges.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Definitely a teens book, but the action is new and exciting, worth the read and looking to see how the trilogy ends...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great Nicholas Sparks book!! He always knows how to grab a reader's attention! I love his use of Southern towns!
1616550414|5.0|Warning: The timeline in this book is about as official as every other one out there.<br />(As in, totally subject to change by future games, but as accurate as can be for an ongoing series).<br /><br />Puts all the games in context with each other, explains how the plots link up.<br /><br />It is also full of awesome artwork.<br />Be warned: This is primarily an ART book. The Chronology and timeline are a fairly small part of this work.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Ordered this dvd from Amazon to complete my set.  It was the only one I was missing.  Got it at a good price and it arrived within the alloted time frame.  Old dvd and I was glad to be able to find it so easily on Amazon. Definitely my on-line place to shop! Ellen P.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a really good book but NOT for kids. I think that it is kind of inspiring for people with bad  life's.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I was looking for Monsters Inc and found the 2 disk edition on Amazon and was delighted to be able to get both of them in one unit.  I have been adding a lot of movies to my kids collection but adults can enjoy this one too.  It arrived within the alloted time frame and was well packaged.  Another good find on Amazon.  Ellen P.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Incredible series cant wait to read this from his point of view.  The teaser they had was just that a teaser
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first heard about this book, but I really liked it. The book is more about the training that SEALs undergo to prepare them for missions like this than the mission itself. Nevertheless, the book is very good and at times moves like a good action movie. I recommend this book.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks that religion is a scam, a system of brainwashing individuals with an agenda to take your money. I always though the idea of God and what people portrays him/her to be is a bunch of ridiculous nonsense. I agree with this book that our society is being held back on the notion that God is in charge of our lives, we could have been far more scientifically advanced and appreciate the wonders of this universe we live in. Please read this book...and thank you Mr. Dawkins for open up my mind to this wonderful world we live in and makes me love science even more, I mean when your passionate about science you can expect to be amazed every time. I must stop now before I start to make no sense.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love the acting, and the sets are absolutely amazing. However, the plot is getting a bit too preposterous -- on the other hand, it's still a wonderful series.
0802798225|5.0|Great book, very true to the condition of the book as well. Very recommended if you like mushy lovey romances.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This covers a 5 yera olds Kindle.  It is easy for her to open/close adn access all buttons. She has been using it for about 6 month now without and damage to the Kindle.  If she can keep it dent free so can you :)
B000VHMF0A|4.0|I'm just learning to appreciate the music of Jamaica.  Now I can't wait to take this album out on the lake on the sailboat.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|this is an awesome app and loved I played it. ONCE. now it wont open!!!! amozon are u listening? I luv tho s game and want to play it amozo please fix!!I am not the only one complaining! !!!!!'
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics. Very interesting storyline. Keeps you interested and wanting to play more. I would recommend this game to friends.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is probably the best book I've read by Stephen King since &#34;The Stand&#34;. Very suspenseful with characters you are truly rooting for. I am truly enjoying the 'average joe' that caught up in a plot that is trying to change history and therefore the world around him. King does a great job at having his main character, Jake Epping, explore the ramifications of his time travel back to the late 50's early 60's w/o having any techo-jargon that would seriously detract from the story.<br /><br />I haven't gotten to the ending yet, but I haven't put the book down (other than to work and sleep). Its a great novel and I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />I'm currently reading this on my 2nd Gen Kindle and the formatting of the book is very well done. The only complaint I have is how the photographs in the book (heck, in most any Kindle book really) are formatted on the Kindle. They are sometime difficult to see and I can't zoom in on the photo to see it better. Perhaps this is just a limitation of the 2nd Gen device or perhaps just another reason to upgrade to the Paperwhite!
B00005JKDR|1.0|I ordered this DVD which was rated used but in Excellent Condition. I received this Two-Disc Collector's Edition with the second Bonus Disc missing and it shipped with no DVD case. It arrived in a paper envelope.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|My wife made me watch it and now I'm hooked. My daughter is now hooked and she has my Ipad and won't give it back until she catches up on the seasons.
B0039N74CW|5.0|I received this DVD in great condition and quickly unlike other sources I ordered from. I have to return 3 DVD's from other sources because of scratched DVD's.
1594744769|5.0|Great read for young adults or fun loving adults.  Very fast paced, quick and fun read.  A peculiar book for a peculiar reader.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I choose this rating because I love this book! I like everything about this book and I'd recommend it to everyone!!! :D
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I loved the show and caught every episode on television but wanted to rewatch.  Great extras and you catch a lot more detail on the second watching than you did on the first.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's wonderful and awesome everyone should download this game. My favorite part is the zipline. I adore temple run two!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Too wordy.  Takes forever to get any of the story out.  Seems like a contest to see how many adjectives can be used to describe any little bit.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Had the free version before, but love the paid version.  Use this when not at home to go to sleep, it works great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played it on my cousin's itouch and its so fun I'm doing it on my kindle I can't wait .  and to my itouch.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I finally decided to try the very popular angry birds. Both my 3yr old and I enjoy playing together and alone. You can turn off the in app purchases!!!! Thank you angry birds
B004XGN8W4|5.0|My son loved this gift for christmas. its very light weight and the picture quality is awesome! It arrived ahead of schedule.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game it is awesome they added way more fun to it than the first one. You should really get this game it is so fun and remember it is free.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Enjoyed it very much. Another great Sparks book. Easy reading and make for a quick read. I recommend it to all.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very addictive and I really enjoyed playing this game! Great graphics and story line. Hopefully there will be a part 2.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is such an inspiring book for anyone in high school. The adventures that Charlie goes through can help anyone in need.
B001IXXYBA|3.0|Ordered this for a neighbor and it arrived like stated.  He and his girlfriend have said it is good and plays well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|AMAZING app, this is recommended for creative people that like to build things. Survival gives out alot of fun as well. All the mobs and buildings really make this a good app
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Love breaking bad very over priced i dont get to townload it and i  had to pay alot for a 1 sow
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Now subwaysurfers has new cities you can play at every month the map changes best game ever you should really get the game  peace out fans of ilichirias@ instagram
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Enjoyable movie. It stayed within the story of the book, but not entirely. If you read the book, there won't be any surprises. The action in the arena was very good.
B009KNPM9W|4.0|\\"Trouble Man\\" captures Marvin Gaye at his musical peak and hits the mark as a great, if understated and overlooked soundtrack album.  With dreams of going to Hollywood at one stage, this was as close as Marvin got to the movies.  While the film has faded away into the annals of blaxploitation, the album remains eminently listenable.<br /><br />Written and produced by Marvin, the album features arrangements by various musicians.  Some 70s themes will sound familiar.  But the strength of the album is its jazzy atmosphere and moody grooves.  Super chill and super mellow, but never boring, TROUBLE MAN is Marvin at his meditative best.<br /><br />The Expanded Edition looks well worth the purchase.  The extras on Marvin's reissues have rarely disappointed - giving diehard fans a deeper insight into the man's work.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|If you're a baseball fan, you'll like it. Gets into the non-glamourous life of a baseball scout and the foibles of older adults facing the realities of health issues.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I was not drawn to reading this book but was told about it and decided to give it a shot.  Well I was pleasantly surprised.  It kept my attention and had a few twists and turns that I did not expect.  I would recommend this book.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Was so thrliled to see that this GREAT movie/musical was finally updated to Blu-ray!  If you have never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to see it first in Blu-ray!
B00B19F3PG|4.0|If you like horror movies this is a good one to watch.  It will definitely keep you awake and paying attention.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|OMG!!! $19 bucks... for ALL three... AND in Blu-ray!?!? I am seriously afraid that one of the Godfather's hit men are going come knocking on my door for, &#34;stealing from the family business!&#34;  Frankly... Amazon, you just made me an offer I couldn't refuse.  :~)
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzel Washington is known for playing good parts in all his,movies. This particular movie give your more of his talent and ability. I really would recommend buying this movie.
0380018179|5.0|Excellent powerful novel.  Staged in two countries this epic novel includes the opposition of man against man, nature vs. man, and man against nature.  This bitter sweet story is so very much like the song of the thorn bird.
B00683JK9K|2.0|The app loaded fine on my regular K.Fire. Graffics are beautiful ' layout and options are exactly as the impressive description video preview showed. However! ! as mentioned in other reviews ... it has MISSING PIECES. This is unacceptable and unplayable considering the object of the game so to speak.<br />I really hope this is resolved with an update otherwise I would expect you owe credits and apologies.<br />I cant imagine a company would make the effort to create such a beautiful layout options and subjects and then not tweak and fix the errors.  So we can hope.<br />If in working order I still would not pay full cost.  It only has 20 puzzles. These are my thoughts about app.<br />Florida Mom
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a super fun game but it freezes sometimes but not much overall great. its super fun to be able to take care of them.
6301670132|4.0|This movie is a classic, and one of Marlon Brando's best in my opinion.  It is a bit out of date, but I like it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|How could you give the BIBLE anything but 5 stars. I have been reading the book of Joshus and I'm loving it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This cannot be beat!  Period!  I hate now that I have to wait until season 4 comes out.  My husband even loves this, and he is PICKY!
0316232955|5.0|Never imagine that he can wrote this good and totally worth your time and the laugh at the beginning then the end is just...well read it then you know
1601251831|5.0|great price and top shelf product. typical quality of pathfinder books and game items.could be bound for flat open use.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Too short of a game for the price. If it were cheaper or longer game play I would have rated it 5 &#9733;s!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this game! It's definitely worth the money. The puzzles aren't too easy, which is a good feature. The graphics are cool too.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book and have been buying copies for family members and friends every chance I get. Enzo, a truly amazing dog, reveals his strong character and integrity as he tells us his master's story. The book made me laugh and cry. It also gave me hope in the human spirit. OK, the canine spirit. But there's still hope for the rest of us. You'll see.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was apprehensive about buying my kindle because I &#34;just don't read that much&#34;.  WOW, I can't believe how the kindle has changed my reading habits.  It is so convient to have the kindle with me around the house, in the car or my purse.  All of that means that I readily have books with me at all times so I can read for a few minutes or long leisure amounts of time.  I haven't taken time to &#34;play&#34; with all of the features because I'm so enjoying the books I've selected. Yes, you should get one.
0765325950|5.0|I'm both sad and relieved the saga is finished.  Kudos to Sanderson for doing the impossible AND writing better than Jordan himself.  I question only the ending SPOILER ALERT!!!  Rand should have either died or been stuck with the one power seeing as Moridin could channel.  That he just got a new body and life free from responsibility seems rather weak.
0399160450|5.0|Threat Vector is one of the best Tom Clancy books I have read.  I found it hard to find a good spot to stop reading as it is a very fast paced story.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm about half a dozen times through it now.  Nice beats, lyrics are clever, and there's some powerful stuff there, too.
037575251X|5.0|I received fast svc. Book in excellent conditionI love the stories by Jack London. Your ratings process is very tedious
0312370849|5.0|PROFOUND... BREAKS YOUR HEART, BUT SHARES<br />ANOTHER SIDE TO THE HORROW OF THE WORLD'S<br />WORST NIGHTMARE, AND HOW SOME BRAVE SOULS<br />HELPED SURVIVORS PAST IT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its so fun. I play it all the time. Its like taking care of a real horse. It is cheep too. And u don't really have to pay for anything unless u want more gems or money. But money is really easy to earn. I love this game!!!!!!!!!!
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I bought this DVD for my kids. I LOVE this movie. I watched it many times and still like it my self. It is a must have a nd one of the greatest classics.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a very good Temple Run variation.  It seems to be very glitchy and not work well when not connected to the netwok, but fun nonetheless.
0545400163|5.0|I bought this book for my son school readings. It is a great reading for a kid in the middle school. The book came in great condition as described. Great price!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest and finding lots of ideas to try out at home.  i have a huge list of foods to make... but i haven't gotten to many of them yet. :)
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Best book I've ever read when it comes to haircare.<br />Great advices and based on scientific research.<br />Loved homemade recipes.<br />I wish every girl in the world would embrace their curls, this book really helps.<br />Loved it.
B004I744AS|5.0|Been looking for a good dictionary.  Ran across free dictionary on an app search and decided to give it a try.  Turned out great.  Love the different languages and all the information it provides about the word outside of the definition.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a book &#34;nerd&#34; and am always looking for a good book.  I honestly don't know what made me read this one but I am so glad I did.  It is one of the best books I have read in a very long time and it was so hard to put it down.  I work a full time job and am a full time Mom and still found enough time to read it in 2 days!  It tears at your heartstrings and keeps you guessing and wanting more! After I finished Hopeless, I looked up the author on the web and emailed her to let her know how much I enjoyed it.  I have never done that before! 2 thumbs up!!!
B003SI600K|3.0|Very entertaing if you're into the style of music and dance themes.  Good follow up to the first movie and has a slight message built in.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I love these books it's 5:34 am cuts I had to know if they made it n than I had to know if Cole made it wish it went on for ever :/ I love wolves and Minnesota  wish there were another book to come out <3<3<3
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Kids play it all the time. The graphics and new scenes are better than the last one.  Very addictive and entertaining
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This is a fun game but it's only free for about the first 30 minutes then you have to buy (or borrow) energy. At that point I stopped playing.  I would rather pay $5.99 up front and play it as much as I want.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is my third time watching this, wanted to get it in before the Super Bowl.  Michael Oher is indeed an awesome player, a truly lucky individual to have the Tuohy family step up.  I hope that he has done the same for others around him, especially his siblings.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The best app...Dream and be functional at the same time! This has everything. Cant belive I didn't have this sooner!
0060556501|1.0|At the time I am writing this, the product listing still says<br /><br />\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (picture book edition) (Narnia) [Hardcover]<br />C. S. Lewis (Author), Tudor Humphries (Illustrator)\\"<br /><br />(Look at the top of the page).<br /><br />The author is INCORRECTLY LISTED as C. S. Lewis.  He did write the story on which a movie was based, and then this book was probably based on another book that was based on the movie.  C.S. Lewis wrote several versions of this story, including some beautiful picture books for children.  This is not one of them.<br /><br />With all due respect to the writer who edited... no, who RE-WROTE this story...this is 1) not written with the tone or style of C.S. Lewis's original, and 2) shortened in a way that shows this new writer does not care as much as C.S. Lewis did about the children themselves, who are the reason for the story.  Just look at the first couple of pages.  Nothing about wartime, the train ride from London into the country, or finding their way to the big old house which is home to the infamous Wardrobe.  The children were already on a journey of adventure before they ever got to Narnia, and this writer doesn't even mention the backstory.<br /><br />In my view, the storytelling here was not a children's edit of C.S. Lewis original work, at all.  At best it is a children's edit of the adult \\"pictures from the movie\\" book.<br /><br />Very dissapointing.  I returned mine.
1476712042|4.0|There was drama and kept me wanting to turn the page. I just ordered &#34;Walking Disaster&#34; and am looking forward to it!!!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews about this book, but I loved it! I loved travis, everything about him! Pidge annoyed me at times but it was a great read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is much more realistic and I think that this is well worth the price. I highly recommend this app for people of all ages
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I moved onto Sylvia Day after reading Fifty shades of grey, and I found myself thinking surely I cannot love this more than Fifty Shades? But I do. This Series is addictive, obsessive and just all round brilliant.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|Bought this collection for my husband as a surprise gift. We both love the Bourne movies.  A must for movie lovers!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was expecting porn and found a sexy, psychological, mystery, love story. Wow!! This is an excellent book. Author wrote a book with descriptive sex scenes and a compelling story!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer! I am not a big reader but this book has captivated me.  I read until I literally fall asleep because I can't put it down.
B001DA9VJW|5.0|Robert Johnson really brings the blues and love to the surface.  Definitely a legend in his own time.  His music gives a new definition to soul and blues.  Great purchase.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|Wonderful whimsical story. Ah - childhood, whether human or alien is much the same with the same parental consequences. Fun to watch.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Brad Pitt did an outstanding job.  Could not believe that he could play so many different phases in one movie.  Great movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played the first Temple Run and it was fun. This game is fun and its sometimes frustrating and its free of course! so yeah I would recommend this game for any age
B0002KZAKS|5.0|The reviews are true.  This mic rocks.  How can it be so cheap?  You got me.  I first took notice of this mic when one of our band members' mics was clearly better, more present and clearer sounding than the lead singer's SM58 mic.  So I asked him what it was, expecting it to be a $200 microphone.  When I found out it was around $22, I couldn't believe it.  I still don't.  I bought one immediately and have been very happy with it so far.  And now the singer from our new band is thinking of getting one too since his expensive, more powerful mic may be TOO responsive, picking up noises and sound from all over the stage, creating feedback issues, etc...  I told him that he should try this one out and sent him the Amazon link.  He's all over it.<br /><br />Great tone and response from this Behringer XM8500.  And, at a price that simply can't be beat, if believed.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I must say that the Brits do a fine job with their productions.  Wonderful acting, props, costumes, and overall...Everything!  I am enjoying the series many times over.
B00A5052YE|5.0|great, best one yet. I always love her work this is no different amazing.  can't wait until more to more
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is more challenging then the first &#34;Temple Run&#34;.  Better graphics, with a lots of screaming from me, woo.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King outdoes himself!  Couldn't put it down!  A must read!  King at his best!  You never know what the future holds, if if we try and change it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game it is fun and challenging and I would recommend it to all my friends & family
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was a fast read for me .  I couldn't put it down.  It had me laughing and crying.  Definitely worth the money and time!  Great read!!!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Well-written plot with a good twist. Enjoy this writer, uses minimally profanity, able to create suspense and appears to know subject well. I will buy the second book and begin reading it next!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I decided to download a few games on my Fire. This is a good one. Fast and fun to pass some time. I like that you can have different Solitaire games and multi players.
146923033X|5.0|I bought the audio version of this book.  I listened to it on a long business drive.  The information was fascinating and helpful.  I just wished that I could drive and take notes at the same time!  I will be purchasing the book so I can highlight the finer points.  This book is a must have for anyone who has to do any presentations.  Whether you are doing presentations for school, work, interview (that is a presentation of yourself), venture capitalist presentations and sales.  The information outlined in &#34;The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs&#34; can be used in many ares of life.  It gives you the tools to help you to become a more persuasive communicator.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|great movie.. had no problem with it . i love 3d movies shop around and this is the best price ever.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best Game I played in the whole world.  It is fun because it is hard and fun and cool.<br />Kina (age 9)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this is a great app and you should at least try it, it's really cool.<br />It's a great app also for HorseLovers, it's like taking care of a real horse.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It deserved every single award it won and then some.  I honestly don't understand why HBO nor the other premium channels failed to show it (although I reserved mine before its release).  Yes, it's a silent movie, but it is true, silents were never silent, and this modern one is proof of that.
B000ID1J40|5.0|Love this movie. Very clever story and some fine acting by Redford and Aykroyd. Actually everybody in this movie has a great part. Very fun movie
B000HT3PPG|5.0|All time classic. I have watched this movie sinceI was a small child. It was a tradition on Christmas Eve. Wonderful movie.<br />Would recommend.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I play this game every day and I love it. definatly worth the ninedy nine cent cost. I hope u can enjoy it too
B002VWNIAY|5.0|One of the all time greats for Bogie and Bacall. I could watch this movie over and over. Great plot. Great movie. Fast shipping
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best because it is the original and not those worthless kickoffs they make the only thing I think they should do is let you detonate TNT in creative mode<br /><br />I like pie
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I great reference for those of us who are working on e-books. It has everything we could possibly need to know.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I wasn't sure if I should buy this video in Blue-ray but I am glad I did. The picture and quality is awesome. I also love the first and second movies. The third movie is a little cheesy.
1401223176|4.0|Setting the stage and covering just about every major character (both hero and villain) Hush is a perfect jumping on point for new readers. And while the big reveal can be seen coming a mile away, the story is taught and rewarding.<br /><br />Lee's art is impeccable as usual, with tiny details waiting for you in every panel.<br /><br />If you're looking for a jumping on point, or want to see an author shoe-horn your favorite Gothamites into a tale of deception, this book is for you.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I just recently discovered this group. Love their style of music. I will definitely be buying more of their music.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|there is a glitch in temple run two when you get the power up and on one of the open turns you will run straight throgh it and will be running on air then somewhere the monster gets you
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought it would be difficult to follow a book that was all one-sided letters, but this one was a really easy and interesting read!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|In spite of the disgusting display of projectile vomiting, this movie had heart and wonderful music. Would recommend this movie.
B005Z28M58|4.0|Maybe not the best season of the show, but it's a very satisfying end for this great TV show. We'll never forget our housewives
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its all right but a pain to unlock new games I wish it was easier to get the games unlocked
B003L77GH4|5.0|After a perfect first season, the challenge was big and it's well done, as good as the first one. Let's hope the 3 will be as good
B00AHXIC50|3.0|There are some songs on this album that I absolutely love.  Especially &#34;Natalie&#34;.  Bruno has a penchant for making amazing music with his old-school crooning abilities.  But some of the songs just don't do it for me.  &#34;Making love like gorillas,&#34;...this phrase makes me want to barf--not make love.  I feel like most of the songs had the potential to be sexy...sentimental...etc., but then he just loses it with the lyrics.  Still amazing beats and a stellar voice to back it, but I only listen to about half the album.  I was pretty disappointed by this.
B005FISBTO|5.0|After a season 5 good but not wonderful, this sixth season is astonishing. And that's without talking about the what the **** cliffhanger !
B007M45PMU|5.0|My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Not as good as the firsts seasons. Better than the sixth. Maybe less funny but I can't stop following these new friends.
B00138KEZ4|5.0|My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|I liked first season... I loves second season. Let's hope the third will be even better. For a start this first one is quite good
B000TEMRXA|5.0|My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This serie is magical. the casting is perfect, the music too and even if all the episodes are not good, this complete first season is great
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Best album I have heard in a really long time. Front to back. Her voice is so haunting! Love LovE LOVE it!!!
B004YM6JI2|4.0|Great begining, middle season not that good, better end. Way better season than the sixth. Season 8 is even better
0812993292|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, mostly because the story is well-paced, engrossing and easy to follow.  This is a story of an ordinary person who tries to do something extraordinary and supposedly very out of character for him if we are to believe what the author tells us about the rest of the main character's life.<br /><br />This is just a sweet and accessible story, well-written and charming.  I wish that the author had included more stories about strangers that Harold Fry encountered on his journey because the were really highlights of the book.<br /><br />However, this book is worth taking a look at if you like British-themed stories, or simply enjoy a sweet story that attempts to dig out some of the truths of life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely loved reading the series! I read it over night, on my Kindle app. Well written, thought provoking. I wouldn't let anyone to young read it though, considering the content,
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The mix of hidden object searching, which was entertaining, and puzzles with adventure story was well worth the price. I enjoyed it but couldn't put it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely loved reading the series! I read it over night, on my Kindle app. Well written, thought provoking. I wouldn't let anyone to young read it though, considering the content,
1451695195|5.0|I do believe this is a very true story and the experience was similar to many other NDE experiences people have.  Gives you some insight into what heaven will FEEL like.  And is a great testimony for those who like to explain NDE's as the brain playing tricks.
8866130915|4.0|Keep your weekly life organized on one page & record your thoughts (or whatever) on the other. And your concert(parking/raffle/etc) tickets in the pocket. Go thru one of these each year, & always by the end it's starting to come apart a bit, but nothing a little tape can't handle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The early levels get you hooked on the game while the harder levels make you think and plan. Look forward to the next puzzle.
B00B3MN65K|3.0|I am a great Josh Groban fan. His previous album, \\"Illuminations\\" was his best yet. My expectations were high, as I feel he gets better and more creative with each album. The songs on this album, however, left much to be desired. The tempo was slow on most of the songs, and I was tired of the songs about half-way through. There isn't a whole lot of variety, or progression of sound from track to track. The best track on the CD is \\"Brave\\". At best, this will be decent background music, but nothing that would make you stop and listen. Better luck next album Josh.
1419705849|5.0|This was a purchase for our 11 year old son.  He enjoys this series and wasn't disappointed in the least with this addition!
B00000J048|1.0|Child almost 3, does not hold her interest at all  The bottom puzzle like pieces come apart as the gears spin.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie!  It was light hearted & fun to watch as a family! We aren't sad about this purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I can't stop playing it. It has really good graphics and it looks like a real horse
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I found this series quite by accident. After viewing seasons 1 and 2, I purchased 5 episodes of season 3 to catch up with the episode currently being televised. The characters are well developed and the actors who portray them are excellent.
0345803507|4.0|This books definitely completed the trilogy.  It leaves you wanting more...hopefully the author will continue this story from a different point of view.  This book needs to be read in order of the trilogy but worth completing the series.
B00005JOHC|5.0|My husband and I love this show! We can't seem to get enough of it! This is perfect for watching at the end of a hectic day.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I really like chistmas music and this cd is great. I listened to it multiple times and is still very festive.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I purchased this for my nine year old son for his birthday. He loved it! My son played with this for hours!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I first heard of the &#34;IZ&#34; on my last trip to Hawaii in Sept 2012. After I listened to Over the Rainbow during my trip I just had to buy the album.
0802473156|5.0|I purchased this book for an assignment in one of my courses. I love this book! It ended up being so much better than I thought it would! I actually shared the information with my husband and it became useful in our marriage. The author provides you with so many helpful ideas.
B000FJGWBC|4.0|Good movie. Action/adventure. Moves right along. Fast paced. Great underwater scenes and beautiful girls in bikinis. What more can anyone ask for.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I purchased this movie for my eleven year old daughter. This is one of her favorite movies to watch. I like it, but she loves it!
1455502758|5.0|It was not a book to read to cheer you up.  But, it had a lot of references to other books and sources that piqued my interest.  It did make me realize how cancer can completely take over your life.  I had cancer, but luckily I did not suffer any of the effects like Hitchens.  I do want to read more of his work after reading this.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Our whole family watched this movie on Christmas Eve. This will continue to be a family tradition each year. This movie is super funny!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I was not really familiar with Led Zeppelin except for a couple of songs that play all the time on radio.  However, after seeing them on the Kennedy Honors, I decided I needed to hear more.  It is unlike most of the music I generally listen to, but I think this CD is making me feel 20 years younger.  I wish I had known more about LZ before.
0987300911|5.0|I think its a great book, and it helped me a lot. So friendly, and useful, I think you should try it :)
B009KNPNT6|2.0|First Clapton CD I bought.  I guess I did not realize what I would be hearing.  I will admit I wanted to hear some of the popular songs that he put out more recently, and I think this is some of his early work.  If you are a real fan of R&B you might like this.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I rated this 4 as I felt it was predictable and and a bit of light reading and nothing spectacular
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun & addictive says it all.  Nice that it has 'level's now .. gives you something to shoot for ... challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is fun. i am really good at it. it is like temple run .  i love it i hope u do 2
B0086700CM|5.0|Good start up game ... Temple Run 2 came out 2 days after I downloaded this one and that one is better so this one is played rarely now.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I really loved the first book in this series &#34;Ender's Game&#34; (Soon to be a movie) and so looked forward to reading this one. I wasn't disappointed, in fact was please that Orson Scott Card had written an introduction to it (he did on Ender's Game also) that gave a history of it and the next book in the series, which was interesting and informative. Helped inspire me to read on. I like how much happens in this book as compared to the first. I liked the development of the characters and the ideas he (OSC) tries on. I love the way he writes about humanity with all it's faults and promise. I recommend this series to anyone who liked &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and the like, even though this one takes our &#34;hero&#34; into adulthood, and a lot of the concepts are an adult way of thinking, it isn't outside the realm of adolescent minds.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this one is much better then the first one and I loved that one too. the only thing I wish is you could transfer the lives left over from the first one
B000EYK2GE|5.0|If you like Elvis, Ringo, George Harrison and Eric Clapton, you'll like this CD. Carl was a very talented writer and made some of our greats greater. I recommend this to anyone to see how it's done...
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|So far into the story I have enjoyed it. If it stays the course it will be one of the better games I've played.
B0092W59VW|5.0|Heard about this band on NPR and was intrigued by the excerpts I heard there, especially when I heard they'd recorded it in New Orleans. I have a soft spot for that magical city... The music is folk-rocky with a bit of anything else they like at the moment thrown in. I will try their other albums. I recommend it if you like this style of music. I hope they do more like this!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I've only just begun playing it so far it has been exciting.  I have to say however if it continues to deliver it could be one of the best G5 games I've played to date
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely, the most exquisite, well-cast, beautifully enacted human story of all times. i live from Sunday to Sunday evening and I watch each of the episodes at least three times each.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This product, game, took too long to download. I canceled it because I wasn't satisfied. I hope the other games aren't as long to download. I love my Kindle.
B00AOMV7VK|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Black Veil Brides really outdid themselves this time. Not only does it have a good sound, but it actually means something, unlike a lot of the music floating around these days. Great music, great lyrics, wonderful band!
0811806405|4.0|The standard criticism of this book is that it deals with both steel string and classical. True, however, the separation in the text is very clear. I have read through the book and although I have not started my project yet, I have no concerns about being able to follow the directions ending up with an eminently playable guitar. Shipping and pricing fully met my expectations.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I was impressed by the attention to detail.  I personally could never believe that all of the life critical machines could be &#34;fixed&#34; that many times but then there would be no story.  The author has done an excellent job of spinning a yarn with a great deal of accurate observations.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is a very intense, fast paced book that hardcore action lovers will enjoy! It's such a great book, I have to have someone surgically remove it from my hands to stop reading it.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I would have given it five stars if I could combine sounds.  Otherwise I really like it.  I like being able to choose my favorites.  I have downloaded more sounds from their website.  I use the alarm functions often and love waking up to a rooster :o)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is very well done.  Scenery is beautiful and the story line keeps getting more interesting as the episodes progress.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|adicting but fun I love it is the best game ever I have never played anything like it before it is awesome
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love how this book was written. A story of deep heartache, true love and the real meaning of family. Loved it.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book was amazing and very heartwarming. Morrie gave really good advice and I will definitely use it. My favorite book by far.
B0063M22QO|5.0|If you like a game that is fun and also needs a degree of observation and thinking, this is it.  If you don't like the tiles presented, you can choose others.  Also backgrounds.  Tip:  If you purchase this, you will note that many tiles are &#34;blocked&#34; until the tile above them is taken.  Always &#34;peek&#34; under the edge of the tile you are about to move and see what is underneath, although you will only see a small portion.  Sometimes this is an advantage to choosing what pair to move.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|This is under Top Free and it's $1.99. I'm confused. is it free or is it paid? it looks fun.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is a fun game!  I didn't like that you have to buy the Jedi Training Level.  You can also 'earn' it by getting 3  stars on Every level.  This takes awhile.  I would recommend this for any Star Wars fan that also likes Angry Birds.  (This review is from my 11 yo son.)
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Nice  graphics.I think this could also help you if you are into horseback riding or you want to know how to take care if horses
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I will  read other books from this author,seem to insert some facts into his investigations,much like Clive Cussler.<br />Larryboutin  thanks
1452101248|5.0|buy a copy of his 2 books today-not only is it inspiring to read the recipes but also inspiring to read how love of food transcends politics
B004BBDHEK|4.0|Not as epica a return to earlier style as expected and a little light on imagination but otherwise a solid work
B00005QGAZ|2.0|I don't like all the tracks with talking at the beginning-I just wanted the great music to work out to!
B0082XJGRK|4.0|this is a very nice read. Reminiscent of Khalil Gibran in style and delivery, has very deep insight and metaphors. I really like it.
B005LAII12|5.0|my son said he had to have this dvd so I got it for him for christmas-he probably watches it every night!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Great game but randomly closes sometimes after using a  Save Me and all work is lost. 1 star until fixed
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This reminds me of the games you see in a lot of truck tops. It is a slow game that is easy to play.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I don't like this product. I thought it was going to work like Adobe but it is not for that. So, what is this?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun and addictive!  My kids got me hooked and now I can't stop playing!  I would definitely recommend this game.  Challenging and good clean fun for the whole family.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Happy with the deal and it's serving it's purpose :} Was what I was looking for. Would recommend if it's what you are seeking.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|This movie so funny, Johnny Depp plays his role so well and Benicio Del Toro as well... The movie is very trippy and spontaneous at times... All in awe the movie is great
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Okay, so I've read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series along with the Kane Chronicles, so, naturally, when The Lost Hero came our, I was ecstatic. I read it, loved it, waited an entire fudging year for The Son of Neptune, loved it (My reaction: PERCY'S BACK O- TO THE FREAKING M-G!!!!!), and the waited another excrutiatingly painful year, and bought this book. I loved this one, too, exceprt for about two minor setbacks.<br /><br />First of all is Annabeth and Percy's reunion in Camp Jupiter. Naturally they make out and there are fireworks that blot out everythimg else in the world (Awwww!), but then Annabeth gets mad at Percy. Why? What did he do? She judo-flips him and is all like, &#34;If you EVER leave me again, I swear to all the gods--&#34; Yeah, DUN DUN DUUUUN!!! Like she'd really kill her long-lost boyfriend right after she found him again. Just blame Hera/Juno! You know very well that it's her fault (the word-I-can't-call-her-because-my-parents-are-going-to-read-this-even-though-she-deserves-it), not Percy's!<br /><br />The other thing I have a minor problem with is Percy. Well, not so much as Percy, but more like the fact it seems like he's lost almost all of his powerfulness. In all the other books, Percy is smart and amazingly powerful while knowing how to use it. In this book, he's still smart, but now it just seems like he's been reduced to a pathetic little weakling. He hardly does anything at all in the book! The best thing he does is kill evil what's-his-face in the aquatium in Albany (or was it Atlanta?) in Georgia and when he doesn't let Annabeth fall into Tartarus by herself and instead falls with her at the end.<br /><br />NOOOOOOOO PERCYYYYYY!!!!!!<br /><br />You really had to make me wait another YEAR for me to see whether he and Annabeth are still alive in Tartarus and whether they live to get out? Come on! I burst into tears at the end of this book when that happened! I don't want to wait!!!
1451662432|4.0|This is a good book.<br />Now to expound on that...<br /><br />When I tell people that Arnold Schwarzenegger has a brilliant mind the response I get is usually a laugh. But his memoir describes exactly what I am talking about. His physical accomplishments not withstanding it amazes me that this man came from a small town in Austria to America and became not only an international movie star but the governor of California. When he first arrived he could barely speak English!<br />Schwarzenegger capitalized on every resource America has to offer and that enabled him to become a million BEFORE he ever became an action hero. He is incredibly smart and has a savvy business mind.<br />I very much enjoyed reading how all of this unfolded. From his humble upbringings, through how he got started in the movies and how they were made, all of it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because as soon as you get to the chapter on meeting Maria Shriver it starts to get a little political heavy and that isn't something I cared to read about. It became dry and uninteresting.<br />The rest of the book is entertaining and thought provoking. He even adds tips and lessons at the end that have made him the success he is today.<br />Yes, he has some skeletons and made mistakes...who hasn't. But Schwarzenegger is an example of what you can really do with your life when you put 100% effort into it.<br />I recommend Total Recall even if you're not an Arnold fan.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|Worth more than it costs. A lot of fun, it was hard to put it down just to write this review.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it......everything about it.  I would recommend it to all my friends and family and its a great gift.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My kids age 4 and 6 love this. We rented it from the library so many times it was time to buy it! I find myself singing the theme song all the time and the kids go around saying pop it open like a soda can!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I downloaded this flick to my Kindle Fire. it made for a really quick plane flight to NY. Would definitely recommend this!
B004FP1WX0|2.0|Not my kind of a movie. Would not recommend.thought movie was very boring! Not a lot of action and was boring.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a great game for the kids. Hell I find I like it too!! It's lots of fun to slice and dice up fruit without the mess!
B009186JYI|5.0|My husbands favorite band! Can't say much really myself but according to him: This was very good and he loved it!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The Adobe Reader is a good app. I installed it on the Kindle Fire. I noticed that I like reading with the Kindle Fire program better than reading with the Adobe App.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I haven't completed the 30 days yet due to various issues.  The dvd is a good workout though.  She swears (&#34;@ss&#34;) in the workout which bothers me.  If you have young children you might not want them around so they don't hear it. I'm hoping to start the dvd again when I can find time.
0446547573|4.0|I grew up on the east coast of North Carolina and are familiar with many of the small towns that Nicholas Sparks writes of.  I've always had a certain affinity with that part of the world.  I've traveled to the warm sands of Aruba, to the rolling green hills of Ireland, to the orange groves of Sicily, and from coast to coast of the United States. With all of those wonderful places that I have had the chance to explore, nothing holds a candle to NC coasts.  North Carolina coasts will always hold a special place in my heart and encouraged me to pick up one of his books despite my qualms with avoiding romance novels in the past.  This was my first Nicholas Sparks novel and I am officially won over.  I will have to go back and read his past stories.  His writing is very fluid and very easy to read.  It admits to darkness and sadness in the world but proves that hope and love exist as well.  I literally read it in a day.  Overall, it was a very pleasant read.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|This is a great set.  I gave it 4 stars because it was cheaper at Costco but I had already bought it.
1439192812|5.0|It is books like this one that we should be reading to our kids.  Maybe if more parents taught their kids facts from science books and less myths from religious books our species could evolve into something better than it is today.  A must read for those who enjoy learning basic science from brilliant scientists.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a wonderful product, especially if your imagination runs wild.  It calms you down AND you can play it while doing something else on the kindle.  Another thing, I have one those leather cases that turns the kindle off if you close the flap, but even though you close it, the app still goes on.  So you can sleep with it on, which is why I got it in the first place.
0140544518|5.0|This is the third copy of this book.  I've given the other away as gifts, so had to have a copy for myself.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Hours of entertainment and TONS of fun!  I can hardly wait to get off of work so I can play.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Too difficult to move man also has perpetual shadow behind moving pac man making it difficult to see and control
0756665949|5.0|It was a surprise how complete & encompassing the LOST ENCYCLOPEDIA is...<br />As any LOST fan knows, you miss one episode....You're LOST.<br />The LOST ENCYCLOPEDIA keeps me on track with my LOST DVDs
B00AKOB7CG|1.0|i had limited use of this app. The second time i tried to use it I found out that to use it further I had to purchase the app.<br />Just what does free mean?  I felt deceived by Amazon.  A SCAM and I am not a happy amazon customer.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Well written.  I could almost physically feel the travails that Cheryl faced on the trail.  I usually don't enjoy narrative that focuses on vegetation or terrain, but this book carefully covers this and the human side. Cheryl's quest to find her true self is an old theme but she has deftly woven her story.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are at their best here!<br /><br />My favorite movie of all time without a doubt!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great characterization, wonderful dialogue, twists and turns galore.  Looks like many people had problems with the ending; I thought it fit the book wonderfully.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|If it told the date would be better and get rid of those ads people get distracted from them a lot of times
B006MW3VGA|5.0|I bought this video $0.00 in Amazon in my Amazon Video, I love to watch this movie relaxed in bed at home instead to drive to the City. I recommended, I love it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great little app and gives the usage a lot of information on the condition of the battery of the Kindle Fire.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book!!!! It is terrific amazing topic and it gave me a message.a think this I recommend for everyone
B004LZFWJO|5.0|It is very good. I am so addictive. Love this application. I recommend that you buy this app because it gets u to think
1616550414|5.0|All I have to say is this book rocks. Everything I ever wanted in a Zelda title. Can not wait to read it.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Great birthday gift for a fan of the movies.  Thought of it because it is the 50th birthday of the screening of this oft remembered classic.  Wonderful all around.
0553801473|5.0|This book was a long time in coming.  It was cheaper than at the local book store and arrived in the mail when they said it would. I just wish Volume 6 was ready for print.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time,it could and should have been a really cute movie if they would've made it so dirty.There were parts we could watch,if I didn't have to pay for it I would stopped it,terrible.I would not care to see it again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line of this game. I felt like I was a part of it. Very exciting!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Like all the Ice Age movies this was great,waiting for the next one to come out.They are so enjoyable,to sit back and just relax and laugh.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|This is a nice enough movie with the usual themes:  the Indian hotel manager is a buffoon, the caste system is unjust and the Europeans address the injustices somewhat, and one man's searches for his sometime homosexual lover.  Couples break up and couples get back together.  Scenes of India are okay; not much dramatic.  Yawn.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|A good action movie with a alot of the older stars,just a great movie to sit back and enjoy.They should make another.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great Book! Good story line. If you are looking for a good book to read, then you need to read this one..
B001DJLCPO|5.0|I didn't buy this movie from Amazon.  That said, I urge you to buy it immediately.<br />If you aren't the type to take unsolicited movie advice, then I urge you to stream it from Netflix (then come back to Amazon and buy it, because you will want a copy).<br />If that isn't your \\"bag\\" then (and I'm NOT condoning this sort of thing), go online and download a copy.  Trust me, you will then buy a copy because you will want to financially support the people who made it in the hope they will make more.<br /><reverse psychology><br />And if all that doesn't make you want to see MIRRORMASK, then you are hopelessly mundane and pedestrian.  This movie is not for you.  Do Not Bother.  You will not understand or appreciate it.<br /></reverse psychology>
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Cheap to purchase<br />Great quality<br />Great movie for kids and family<br />Good entertainment, full of colour and lots of characters with a good story line.
1250007305|2.0|Well first off if you do not finish the book you cannot really write a book review can you? Well I read it all, only took me about 4-5 hours. Any way for a first time author I give him some slack on writing style and plot deployment. That said what really ticked me off about the book was the piss poor way he explained the technology. Sure I understand he knows windows and code, I been using his tools for years now. Still while this is trying to be a techno thriller even most layman would know this is so far fetched it not funny.<br /><br />1. 787 do not use windows 7/vista whatever to fly them. Plus they have some manual gauges even in the most current glass cockpits. How does a virus from the internet get into a 787 that does not run Linux/mac or windows code? Your not going to reboot a airplane, lol<br /><br />2. how does a root kit or virus just kill a pc, wipe the boot disk sure, wipe the bios maybe but I doubt it. You can fix those and reload. Data DOES not get infected.<br /><br />3. etc etc on other things many have said.<br /><br />its a ok 1st try but he had a ghost writer, you think it would be better. Get the book at the bargain bin and you will not hate it as much as I did. For me the big turn off is the tech being all wrong. It does not pay to be a security/network engineer and know servers and read this book, you will laugh your butt off.<br /><br />actually enjoyed the tech babes, never really seen any in real life myself....
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I have read 4 hour body and work week books before and even though I am not a fan boy of Tim, I did enjoy them and found a lot of useful materials inside. 4-Hour Chef had too much of old materials recycled and repackaged. Furthermore, although the book is touting itself as the guide on how to learn anything - in reality it does not go deep into any of the topics of learning.<br /><br />Cooking recipes were pretty good and it is a different way to introduce cooking to someone. Although I would not necessarily call it simple cooking because the number of recipes was very big where for the beginners it is most useful to learn 2-3 good dishes and focus on them. Then branch out to the other areas.<br /><br />Overall was very disappointed with the book and returned it after couple days of reading it.
B00683JK9K|1.0|Those two words sum up this Magic Puzzles app. The music and the puzzles are pretty. The app itself is terrible. No amount of tapping, double or otherwise, would rotate the pieces...and without that feature working, I decided it wasn't worth keeping.<br />It needs more options and it needs to have all features working properly. It has possibilities but not as is, and not today's release.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I liked the movie, it might just be after a few people that I know said the movie was bad so my expectations were lowered when I did see it, but I found the movie to be true to the other Bourne movies.  Lots of action and a fast paced movie.  The movie itself didn't really offer up much of a back fill and didn't give any secrets away but was entertaining anyway.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I loved the movie and the sound track as I love country music and Tim McGraw was awesome as was Gwyneth Paltrow.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I've lost the wheat and feel great.  4 stars because some of the narrative seems to me, extreme and unnecessary.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|We love this movie so much we had to buy it, it was truly moving and one of the great all time movies out there.  Good clean entertainment without sex, violence, bad language and no magic or spiritistic creatures.  Disney needs to produce more of these movies.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You pretty much love Firefly or you don't. I love it.<br /><br />A cross between old west, futuristic technology, great soundtrack, good cinematography, excellent writing Firefly weaves the story of the people on Serenity after Earth is no more.<br /><br />I just wish it hadn't been cancelled and there were more seasons. However, after the movie Serenity, I don't know if I could watch it.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I have seen them in concert twice and I am telling you they sound equally as good both live and on their recorded albums.
B000OIZSVY|5.0|I enjoy this book very much. It's very informative and educational in the use of punctuations. It's fun to read.
0446547654|5.0|I love his books, I have read them all and find each of them equally moving, I especially enjoy when they are a movie.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A must read.....the human side of our real life Commandos!!!! The general public has no idea how valuable these guys are, or the supreme sacrifice they give.....They are the real deal that the action movies portray...only they do it for real--every day. these men are priceless in our value to our society and deserve the utmost respect and devotion.....I could be a &#34;groupie&#34; if Navy Seals could have them.....
B002SAUCBC|4.0|A good solid SK..Bachman book.  The characters draw you in and keep you there, BUT the ending left me so unsatisfied
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie--have been looking forward to watching it since it first came out on the big screen.  It did't fail me, it was very good, both Batman and Catwoman were excellent!  I would highly recommend it!!!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|The best movie ever, i love it. I recommend if you are looking for action and thriller i dont know what else
B00170I7GG|5.0|This has been a favorite movie in my family since it came out.  My kids grew up and moved into their separate lives and took the movie with them.<br /><br />I believe this is one of Bill Murray's best acting movie's he's ever made.  I was thrilled because I actually rented this movie from Amazon.  The only time I've used this tool in Amazon.<br /><br />You should try this new ability on Amazon, I highly recommend it.  Just like watching it at the movie theater, but right in my own home.....Rafinaz
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. You on this emotional rollercoster through out the whole book. You get mad, sad, and you will cry!!! Great book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I LOVE horses so this is the next best thing to really having one! And you have to completely take care of it too.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good fast read! Light hearted and just fun to read. I would recommend it for anyone who loves a good book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.6.1 is here I just got it if you don't have it rapidly touch the sync button<br />So for you people that want it try that
0316224588|5.0|What more could a crime-novel enthusiast want than a new Inspector Rebus novel? And this one picks up where the series left off. Rankin at his best, with his finest character.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Robert deniro and Joe pesci are great together wish there are more acting teams like them if you haven't seen this movie and I don't know who hasn't you are missing a masterpiece
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So much happens! I laughed I cried! And now I'm sad is over. Can't wait for the movie. So amazing
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book I have read it more than 5 times already! Even when I read it before the suspense never lets me put it down.
B0030IIZ1A|5.0|Blu ray feature is waaay better than the original DVD or vhs.. Its the only way to go with these classic Disney movies!
0307474259|1.0|I can save you time and money by telling you this is an endorsement of the Atkins Diet. He gives the history of weight loss and why it is all wrong, and some unnecessary naked photos of poor fat people or people with unusual shapes with the black bars over their eyes -- and then finally tells you how to eat in the Appendix, which starts on page 219. I don't need to know why you think this works. Just say this works, eat this way. I'll try anything for a couple of months. I do know you can lose weight on the Atkins, but it is a really difficult diet to stay on. You can't have any sugars or sweet things on this diet, and most starches including rice, cereal, bread, pasta, muffins, bagels, crackers, beans, carrots, corn, peas, potatoes, French fries, potato chips, fruit, juice, milk, yogurt, canned soup, ketchup.<br /><br />Plus, you have to eat two cups of salad every day and 1 cup of vegetables and drink 2 cups of bouillon. This is not an easy lunch to prep and pack.<br /><br />So you tell me, can you do this? Good luck.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the this app. It's a lot like temple run but there's way more characters and the boosts are better.Again I love  this app so much.
B008J34466|5.0|I got this at a great cost and Pink is awesome! Purchased this for a family memeber and Pink is the best!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is funny so that it is like a games like on a10 this is also funny so my big sister like it
1616550414|5.0|This is a great history of the Zelda universe combined with quality art & construction. This book is heavy...a solid cover/spine with thick glossy pages to preserve the beautiful artwork within.<br /><br />This book is underpriced at $20, based on the quality alone.
B001P06GX4|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game with kids and adults.  It was easy to learn and challenging enough for most levels.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is the best looking and best sounding Blu-ray I own so make sure the neighbors are gone, crank up the sound and enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Short games that can be played quickly, but are still fun.  I haven't had to pay for any points yet, but I haven't played for very long yet.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Bought it for my grandson, he love it and I like it too. The quality of the movie was very good.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|More illumination than the bulb gave, and more even. All that is missing is the click sound when you press the end for off and on.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|You're not looking at this DVD for Oscar material so it's fine that it's a little thin in spots.  For me, it works as a nice, grown-up holidays movie.  I first saw it with my sister-in-law around Christmas time and it was just right as a girls day outing, all cheerful and full of varied romantic situations.  Michele Lea (from &#34;Glee&#34;) even does some singing in Times Square to round out the NY's Eve theme.  So if you want a light, fun, ensemble rom-com, this fits the bill.
B008PWUT9M|5.0|bought the kindle for xmas along with this sleeve and she was very happy.  Protects the kindle very well and doesn't take up to much space in her purse.  Fast shipping too.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Really.  Streep crosses all genres, doesn't she?  I think ABBA's music's great, the fun story is deftly plotted, the characters all interesting, and the singing mostly enjoyable (although Pierce Brosnan is definitely stretching it).  But Meryl Streep is the real reason to watch this.  She's a bubbly hippy delight, dancing around the sets and throwing herself into everything.  This is a great adult romantic comedy for those who find today's young, brooding hipster romances as irritating as nails on a chalkboard.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this is a great game  this game doseverse a lot of stars  every one shold play this game people should play it a lot .I think this app should be the best game ever . I love this game  it has made me a even bigger video  game player.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|This is a surprisingly good film which vividly portrays a day in the life of a wall street firm, albeit one that is in full crisis mode and about to implode (or bring the whole market crashing down with it, if need be). Given what happened with the market meltdown of 2008 it may be hard to watch for many, especially those who disapprove of the casino-like nature of modern finance (myself included). But the movie does a decent job, according to a relative who spent years in this field, of highlighting just how fragile the system is, and how few safeguards are in place to protect against reckless speculation. The tense plot is supported by a brilliant cast (Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons are stand outs). There are no real heroes to applaud, but it's worth watching nonetheless.
B000001GX5|3.0|Respighi's Pines and Fountains have been well served by many recordings.  They span classic accounts from Reiner and Toscanini to more modern recordings by Gatti, Maazel, Muti, Pappano, Rizzi, and Dutoit.  I completely disagree with the review by Santa Fe listener (with whom I generally concur) which indicates this is \\"second rate music\\", and has little to offer outside the mere sonic fireworks.  Perhaps Santa Fe doesn't care for Respighi, but to me this music is very special for its pictoral qualities, as well as the way it virtually evokes the spirit and feeling of Rome.  My opinion is these compositions are among the finest of the 20th Century by any composer.  In terms of recordings, my personal favorites are Maazel with the Pittsburgh Symphony, and Pappano with Santa Cecilia.  This recording by Karajan has good sound, and is played with the usual panache by the Berlin Phil.  Unfortunately it just doesn't quite measure up in terms of performance.  It is too lush, too homogenized in my view, with few of the evocative characteristics this music requires.<br /><br />There are better recordings of Ancient Airs & Dances, namely those by the Australian Chamber Orchestra under Gee and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra under Wolff.  Again, Karajan here is too heavy, and a bit too ponderous.  The Boccherini and Albinoni are well played but again cannot be considered primary recommendations for these works.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I love Glee and this album is great! I watch all of the shows and download the music all of the time!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series was awesome but there was occassionally glitches in viewing due to internet connectivity (my probelm not theirs).  I would recommend watching this show.
B005721W9O|4.0|I think this movie is a great movie very funny Tim Allen did A wonderful job and so did the rest of the crew I will sit and watch this movie and just laught for hours
B001I45UFC|5.0|This was a pleasant read---interesting plot, good vs evil!  Was wondering if they would every get back to<br />the wardrobe closet---read it, you'll enjoy it!---<br />JCA (not JVA)
B00004YA66|5.0|I had this movie a long time ago, but loaned it to a sick friend of mine, as she had never seen it. While it was there, she died. I let the family know I had loaned her some movies, however, they never returned them. Amazon is the only place I knew to look for it. Thankfully now I have it again. Look forward to more business in the future.Great movie!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I have always loved the story, it was great to be able to read a classic tale and fall in love with the characters all over again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely love this game! I play it everyday and look forward to when it changes to a different area. Wish you couldget double coins with coins though
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's been a long time since a television series has held my attention as long as the Walking Dead.  With incredible acting, interesting characters, and marvelous direction, this is a show for everyone regardless if zombies are not usually your cup of tea. My wife hates movies/shows in this genre normally and she loves it too!!!!<br />  I look forward all week to Sunday nights. It's a Blockbuster summer movie in one hour time slots that just doesn't end. THANKFULLY! Well done AMC, well done....
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|It is an excellent movie that tells the story from her point of view - great work to tell a true story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Don`t buy the demo the seven dollars are worth it<br /><br /> The game is awesome best game ever made  super cool
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the message of this book. It should give inspiration to women who have been abused and don't think they deserve to be loved.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is so addicting! I just don't like waiting for my energy to fill up so I can explore the rooms. Since it is a free game though it is worth it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very enjoyable...i love how you have &quot;toys&quot; and other carnival like pieces..to roll down the conveyor belt...you get to earn coins as you play..to do nothing with...:)  but it is still fun to play.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I bought this to work with Kinect and a projector with a 140&#34; screen. Due to the nature of projectors, all of the audio/video equipment is on back wall, so I needed a cable to get across the room. I bought this active usb extension on a whim to see if it worked, and it works great! Now my Kinect is hooked up to my Xbox 360 at over 40 feet away and it still works perfectly.  Now my biggest issue is that my living space is too big and I have to move the Kinect closer to the couch, but that's a different story.
0345803485|1.0|This is a Stupid book and was not worth my time reading it. I felt the sex scenes in it just were the same old thing by the end of the book. They were not that exciting to begin with!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Worked fine on my Nexus 7 and was enjoyable.  I always look for big fish games when shopping for entertainment.
0553801473|4.0|Good book but once again the author rambles on on. He needs to get to the point of the story faster. It is still an enjoyable read but it would be a smaller book and a lot more interesting with out the rambling this author does in all his books.
B001EO748M|5.0|Loved the second season of the Tudors.....I purchased a used DVD set which for the most part was fine, 3rd & 4th discs were a little dirty and had some trouble with skipping at parts but was able to clean enough to not miss anything.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|seen this movie years ago could not remember the name than found it got it quickly in the mail and have enjoyed watching it sharon stone is awesome in this role.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing from beginning to end! Every time I thought it was headed in one direction it took you in another!! The emotional journey is intense and you can't help but feel like you are right there along for the ride. I was left speechless more than once. Great read!
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Purchasing movies on here is HORRIBLE! It plays for 3-4 minutes then freezes and you can't cancel it or start over.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The wonderful characters combined with the history made it hard to put down. I'm planning to read the second book soon. I was dismayed to read that the third book won't be published until 2014. My memory isn't as good as it used to be!  LoL
B00008CLIP|5.0|I have been looking for these discs for months. They are a great addition to the collection. I'm very pleased.
B004N66XYE|2.0|fairly poor interpretation of the libreto, disappointing decor,seen much better british series , i will not recommend this production to anybody
B006FE83V8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. In blue ray, the quality is magnificent. By all means, if you love this film you need to own it in blue ray.
B00006J3WH|3.0|I got this CD or my sister when se was a Buffy fan.  She liked it !  Perfect for any fan of the Buffy series.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Bought this for my Kindle. I've played it on the XBox 360 and while the generated worlds aren't that large I find that the survival mode is still much more interesting. It has almost everything you need but you need to manage your resources a lot more closely! Definitely worth the price and I love seeing how creative my boys are with the creative mode!
B001FKKLNK|5.0|When you discover the Bill Evans trio for the first time, it is a moment to relish. When you've had a satisfactory day, or a unpleasant one, Bill Evans is there, either easing you into the next or calming you down. Bill Evans, is the type of artist that makes the world a tolerable place. Bill Evans, Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian created a unique chemistry that can be heard in the beginning of, &#34;My Man's Gone Now,&#34; with each of them showcasing their talents. George Gershwin wrote the song for, &#34;Porgy & Bess.&#34; The mourning in the original aria of a woman whose husband was murdered is carried to its full emotional intensity by the Bill Evans trio. Scott LaFaro's bass is used as singular voice with Bill Evans as a counterpoint. A memorable interpretation. That is one example of many about the power of this recording. This recording, along with, &#34;Waltz for Debby,&#34; is a must have not just for your record collection, but for your life.
B002RI9HUM|3.0|ok for chic lit but a bit of a non event for my liking.  characters didn't engage me at all.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game sucks! Exspecially with the s***y made kindle fire hd! Whcih lags, shuts down ur games. This game lags, and has bad reading when u swipe on the screen! And i know irs not just my kindle, my friends sisters kindle does the same thing, honestly just by a ipod 4 th gen or 5 gen, when i had mine it never lagged and did great with apps! I thought selling the ipod to buy this kindle would be a good chose and the kindle would be a faster device! Well its not!
B009IU6N5Y|3.0|Of course you have to totally suspend belief to get into it.  It's a fun premise though and the movie quality was very good on my Kindle Fire HD
034580404X|5.0|This is an AWESOME series of books!!! .<br />NOTHING like the porn everyone said it would be.<br />It was actually quite a neat love story.....
B003ASLJK4|3.0|I absolutely love this movie!  Playing it on my laptop and getting &#34;skipping over damaged part&#34; (or words to that effect) ... ???????  Why is it damaged?  Got this message twice!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Good read,moved along well. Words very descriptive of what was happening. Easy to put yourself in the book. I would recommend it to friends.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves horses and this app is blowing her mind! She's 3 so it's a little over her head but what she can do, she loves!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the way she ropes you in. I couldn't put it down. I've recommended this to many of my friends.
B000BNX4MC|4.0|One of the daughter's favorite movies. Just good clean fun and Let's you know how to just enjoy life because it just might pass you by
B007J4T2G8|5.0|EL James ropes you into this complicated story and leaves you wanting more. I could finish this book fast enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome. It sometimes freezes. Other than that it's the BEST.  Game!!!!:) GO SUBWAY SURFER! PEACE OUT YO!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a great book hoping that a sequel will be on the way. I hated to finish the series EL James leaves you wanting more.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I have heard of this show but since I do not have cable never gave it much thought until my sister suggested watching the first episode. I was hooked! Not only are the sets and clothing gorgeous but the actors really pull you in and the story is well written.
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|Michael Corbett Shannon gives a really great performance as the detective, and the whole cast, including of course Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are good.  Both the action and the plot are compelling.  I first saw this movie on a plane, and I never knew what to expect next, and felt it just kept getting better.  This is not a pretentious film, and it seeks to entertain, which makes it a nice choice when you want to seem something a bit different, fast paced and funny.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was hard to put down, I really liked the author switching from present day to the past every other chapter.  I really enjoyed this book!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was looking for a new series to start on my kindle and because of the movie coming out decided to check out the Jack Reacher stories.  I was immediately drawn in and barely put it down until I finished it.  Book 2, Die Trying has had the same effect on me.<br />LOVE IT TIMES 5!!!!<br />Cindy
B0007TKNII|5.0|I had to own this but I have downloaded the bluray version on bit torrent. so you can too.... do that..
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is a great app, you get  exactly what you want a simple solitaire game and the card settings are easy to use, perfect for passing the time
B0026772N8|4.0|Great read. Definitely a little more philosophy than I was expecting, and surprisingly little zen. But a great and thought provoking read.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|a friend raved about this show so I thought I'd see what it was all about. have watched 5 episodes. so far so good. not for every one, but for those of us who like things a little off beat it works
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It is very engrossing to read about the way the zombies took over and how humanity fought back. The way Brooks ties personal stories and geopolitics into the zombie apocalypse is amazing.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I did not receive it so how can I review it?  I was told that the file was to large for my  reader.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|A quirky and somewhat heart wrenching account of the second world war and how one man copes with his experiences there. A little hard for me to put a finger on what it all means, but definitely a good read.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|When I got to the last page I wanted to cry.I loved it!I think it is a five star book!
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Was not going to watch it initially due to warning of being very graphic but love Kevin Bacon.  So ended up watching the first 2 episodes on Amazon and could not believe the constant level of suspense.  There were very graphic murder scenes but they were visible for very short periods of time....it definitely does not cater to the slash and gash but is more mental and emotional suspense.  Love it!
B001ANSSDC|1.0|i seriously cannot believe that this book has so many five star ratings. the narrator of this book speaks like a child, eschewing contractions, calling a mental hospital \\"the bad place,\\" calling a restraining order \\"apart time,\\" etc. reading in his voice is beyond tedious, and makes it impossible to believe that anyone could ever care for the main character. the author relies on stereotypes about mentally ill people to create a character, and as a result the author is portrayed as unintelligent, unstable, violent, and childlike. the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic (the main character's mother tells him, twice, that his father is a big fan of the eagles- if he grew up in a house with an obsessed eagles fanatic, why would they need to verbalize this?). the author's infantile voice brushes past and minimizes violence against women and borderline stalking.<br /><br />on top of everything, this novel is like anti-literature, because it contains 'spoilers' about a bunch of genuinely good classic novels!  not only do you have to read a bad book, but it detracts from the potential enjoyment of good books by revealing their plots.<br /><br />p.s. the phrase 'silver linings' appears about 12 times in the first 8 pages of this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|too funny and fast paced.  I loved it and will play the game again and will ask others if they like it too
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I made these funny videos and then all of a sudden it stopped and it hasn't worked since January and I'm so tired of it I'll change my review of it starts working again
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. I am not typically a drama fan but Downton Abbey has me hooked. I do hate what has happened to my favorite characters and am mortified that I must wait a year to find out what happens next.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is great! Love watching the way of life for these people in this century. The entire cast is fantastic!<br />Would recommend it to anyone who likes watching a series with an interesting story and a lot of class.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I really liked the tunes on this CD, I had heard them all on Justin Bieber's YouTube, I bought this for my car. I would recommend it to everyone!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Hard to put down.  As a Flynn fan, I am always waiting for the latest and greatest of his stories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun but could use some work it is my favorite game to play when I am board I highly recommend it to my friends.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|changed the way we are eating!  Working for my husband...not so much for me.  But, I see and understand the science.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson and Team Jordan did justice to Robert Jordan's legacy and ended The Wheel of Time in style. A fitting tribute
B006RXQ8RI|1.0|thought I would watch this and then Volume 2 on a movie channel on TV...made it through this one and deleted Vol 2.
B0031ES8P6|2.0|When we received this item the skirt was folded up and we couldn't get it to stay down. That seems kind of silly, but it was an annoyance that we didn't appreciate.
B005Z28M58|5.0|It honestly was not as good as I expected it to be but over all good. Definitely worth the money though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I heard about all the hype about this show on CBS This Morning. It piqued my interest and I decided to check it out. I just wanted to watch one episode after another. It is a really fun story about a rich English family and their servants. Very fun!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Needed to put this down a few times, but it still took me only a few days to read. Reading about kids with cancer can be difficult, even when they're tough as nails and armored in gallows humor. John Green's tight thematic structure makes the read all the more intense. I will seek him out again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|totally worth the download. horse lover's and equestrian enthusiasts! it's awesome. if you've played non interactive horse games and gotten bored this is better for your entertainment!
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|Great purchase, arrived in excellent condition.  This was a gift for a family member, they were very happy with it.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Unlike other user's I've had no problems at all. All the pieces of the puzzles have been there very pretty puzzles and fun.
030758836X|1.0|There was not one character in this book that I could attach myself to and like.  The book was so dark and evil and the ending a hugh disappointment.  Wish I had not wasted my money and time on it.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A good over view of how our past and the then current presidents have worked together.  Plus views of how past presidents worked to extend their own agenda.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well worth the money to get caught up to date on Season 3! Love the ease of using Amazon Prime video.
B00003OSTV|5.0|This movie chronicles the treatment of Christians shortly after Jesus died. A very accurate portrayal of how they were hunted down and persecuted. No gore...but it will grab ahold of your heart and make you think.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a super fun game I loved it so much it is so cool you have to get it
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good game and you can set the degree of difficulity. Give more challenge options. Good game for the beginer of the seasoned player.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Although the author presents a logical and well researched explanation of his personal experience, and e en though he is a neurosurgeon, I still have trouble  believing that he is showing proof of consciousness without normal brain activity because I am not convinced that we know enough yet of how the brain really works and what it is capable of.

B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Here's Peter Jackson's long awaited follow up to the universally acclaimed Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the Hobbit, which is only one book, that's stretched out into the same amount of time. Why? Because f***ing $$$ that's why. But stretching it out adds a lot of problems, namely, filler. And adding in filler into a movie like this kills a lot of other things, the humor feels tacked on and forced, the action scenes are unnecessary and boring, and overall it's just a bad combination.<br /><br />So obviously everyone involved is super passionate about making the Hobbit, which saves it in many aspects. You can just tell Ian Mckellen is glad to be in his wizard costume again, the dwarves put their all into their roles, and Martin Freeman plays a perfect Bilbo, showing his initial trepidation slowly transforms into full blown commitment to the mission. The huge budget also works, the scenery is gorgeous as always and if anything works better as a big 3 hour postcard from New Zealand.<br /><br />But there are many problems to consider, the most obvious one was the aforementioned 'filler'. Many scenes just run on too long and feel like it's going nowhere, the most notable example is the troll scene. Before the actual part, we have to watch the 'suspense' of Bilbo lurking around their campfire, with Bilbo almost being caught by the trolls multiple times. All the while this is going on the trolls are talking like the three stooges with limey accents, and the whole time this scene was going on I just felt like Peter Jackson was saying \\"we know this scene goes nowhere, but look at the funny trolls and the suspense!\\" I felt neither except for my ass getting sore.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed me was when the wizards and elves got together on their big meeting. Some of the stuff they talked about was legit, like how Smaug is a major potential threat they should neutralize, but keep in mind, this is before Lord of the Rings, so how about we see a different side of their relationship? It was kinda cool seeing Gandalf and Galadriel meet, even though it seemed like they were sleeping around with each other. But then Saruman comes in, and he's the same prick we knew from Lord of the Rings. I mean I get that he'll become a villain, but can't we at least see some comradely between him and Gandalf? Instead he talks down to Gandalf, and Gandalf just rolls his eyes at Saruman. C'mon! They were friends! They warmly greeted each other in Fellowship, so showing a friendly side of Saruman would've been fine! In fact it could've showcased the great evil coming more, in that it corrupted their most powerful wizard! But noooo. That was a big missed opportunity in my opinion, if your going to show these characters again in a movie that doesn't focus around them, at least bring a new side to it.<br /><br />Then there was the head dwarf, who was literally just Aragon 2.0. He is the same quiet stoic badass leader of the group, and he goes so far as to even give off the same Bambi eyes throughout the film. Many times you'll see him and it looks like he's about to cry or something, and all we saw of him in this film was either silently being a badass or looking like he's going to cry for no reason at all. The main scene where Aragon looks like he was about to cry was the scene where I looked like I was about to cry the first time I saw it, when him and Frodo understood they had to part ways, and in complete silence, Aragon tells Frodo that he would've followed him to the very end. Now that was a powerful scene, because the entire film built up to it with more than just Aragon thinking Frodo is a pussy. In fact the entire scene of the fellowship disbanding in the first movie was pure cinematic gold, powerful scenes which added depth to fantasy characters, something almost unheard of. But what do we have here? An albino goblin mocks the main characters' dad or something, much less of an impact there. Though the actor probably did all he could but he was written poorly and was probably the least interesting character in the film. The other dwarves don't have much personality to them, and just like the book, distinguishing them apart was challenging, however the make-up department does a good job of making them look different.<br /><br />Another thing was how many big action sequences feel lifted out of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The warg chase in the open plains felt reminiscent of the Two Towers (they even retain scouts), the scene with them getting out of the mountain after being chased by a bunch of goblins felt like the Moria scene from Fellowship (I think they even have a scene where a few of the dwarves are stuck on an unsteady platform), and other would be the eagles saving everyone. I know some of this stuff was in the books, but it felt like I've seen it all before, and hopefully those are the last scenes reminiscent of Lord of the Rings scenes (I forgot the book, I read it like 10 years ago).<br /><br />Then there was the scene where they're crossing the mountains and it turns into a giant mountains fight. From the books I thought they saw it at a distance or something, but here they're right on the rock giant's legs, I mean why? So we can have more action? That's the problem with this film, it never really feels like a world like Lord of the Rings did, because there's too much sporadic unnecessary action, and not enough time where the film calms down a bit and lets you soak Middle Earth in. Case in point is the pointless mountain giant fight where the dwarves are right in the middle of it.<br /><br />Also the goblins seem much less threatening this time around, however that makes sense, because the Hobbit isn't as dark as Lord of the Rings, so I guess a cartoon King Goblin making silly jokes makes sense. I just remember how in Moria they looked like demons, and here they look like cartoon bad guys. The Riddles in the Dark scene was well done, and surprisingly they didn't drag that one out. The ending was sorta heartwarming, where the dwarves accept Bilbo, it was like now we were getting somewhere with the characters instead of seeing them fight all the time like video game characters.<br /><br />Overall the Hobbit isn't a bad film, but it's also no where near the heights that Lord of the Rings were at, but as I stated, Lord of the Rings is more serious and heavier than the Hobbit. So if they embraced that this film is more kid friendly, instead of mixing it up with some darker LOTR prophecy stuff, and if they trimmed it down to just two 3 hour movies instead, and come out with an extended edition later, it would've been much better. But then again they would make 1/3rd less profit, so that won't happen. So at the end we have an enjoyable fantasy that feels a little bloated.ten poorly and was probably the least interesting character in the film.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am not usually into teenager love stories, but this one was fantastic. Hoover did a great job of drawing the reader into the lives of the characters. I'd read more of her books.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes, I have all the stories by Sir Canon Doyle in book form. I have a number of the old movies from the 40's and when I saw this movie it was a welcome addition to my collection. I have been totally impressed by Robert Downey Jr. his whole career, I am so glad to see him in so many movies.

Whether its ornithology, archaeology, anthropology, or  present society his grasp and understanding of the world in which we live is enormous. For those individuals interested in where we came from and why we behave in the manner which we do, this and his earlier  research is a must read.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|A great puzzle game to play whenever. The puzzles are a little lacking, though, each one only taking about a minute to solve. Some are very difficult on the other hand, and require much more though. A very fun game overall, though.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was really excited when I see the Coppola Remastered Blu-ray edition of the excellent Godfather Series in gold deal. The price was incredibly cheap. I bought 3 movies for the price of one plus it's a blu-ray. Of course, do not expect something like Avatar, when you see the Coppola Restoration sign. Do not forget that this movie is old. The quality of the movie is quite good and it's definitely worth to add it in your archive. I would even recommend those who already have the movie to buy it too. The deal is pretty good and the movie is even better.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|good fun to play and to wast time on nothing and also look like a bum from far a way
B006GWO5NE|2.0|I bought this item with kindle powerfast for accelerated charging and it stopped working with the powerfast after a few months.
B003WQT2YY|1.0|I absolutely LOVED the theatrical release, bought the soundtrack on LP, the VHS version, and was delighted to see Amadeus on DVD at a video store.  I snapped it up without paying much attention to the words \\"Director's Cut\\" at the bottom of the case.  Then I tried to watch it.  The Director's Cut nearly ruined the whole movie for me.  The added material slowed down the pace, did not add to the story, and was a major distraction from the music.  I could hardly wait for our family's next yard sale so I could unload this thing.  Fortunately, I found a DVD of the theatrical cut a couple of years later.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game. I like to play it and so does my mum. Great fun  when you are bored. I recommend you get this app. FAB

His book will be enshrined as a collectible memoir of his achievements to his country and the world.<br /><br />Sad to hear of Chris' death at the hands of one of his own veterans, in his own country.<br /><br />FYI, I don't usually support war, but I can handle a sniper rifle and have spent thousands of hours handling live assault weapons during my full-time active service. The platoon I was assigned was also named \\"Charlie\\". Chris' sufferings, profession and contributions are something I can relate to.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Chris! I salute you and thank you for all your contributions in making this world a safer place!
B000BEZQ0Y|3.0|Of course, the music itself is just wonderful! Love the movie and the music. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was the order of music selection does not match the order on the dvd.( I considered leaving only a 2 star review!) I deal with sleeping problems including  insomnia. I often sleep with the movie on so my mind is occupied. I bought this cd so to just enjoy the music without having to have the bright light of the tv on all night. It took me awhile to adjust to having the order not match. I couldn't picture the movie scenes in my head with the cd. So it has been a disappointment.

With this book, you can take a Raspberry Pi out of the box and start programming your own games or applications in a very short time.

B00A9X9ORI|4.0|The actor who played the young Bruce Willis nailed his part, and I always love Bruce Willis!  The show was fascinating!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks' books and I wanted to read it before the movie coms out. It was an easy read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is ten times better than temple, because of the speed of the game and the updates. The way the game changes places is great, and the new boards that match the place is the cherry on top. This is one of the greatest games I've played in a while.

B005LAII8K|1.0|I found this story line to be stupid - It seems like Bruce Willis will take some rediculous parts sometimes but I guess its all about money - Save your money buy something else and send Hollywood a message.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|i am a big fan of this show and when the second season in the collectors box goes on sale at a lower price. im on it.

B006AX6ONI|3.0|I've been a huge Mark Cuban fan for a long time. Yes, he's a cocky guy, but he can back it up with his accomplishments. I found the material to be good, but was disappointed that it was all more or less pulled directly from his Blog Maverick website.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|This movie was in the consition it was supposed to be in and came in the time it was due to come in.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I have been a fan of Bad Religion for more than 15 years which sounds great until I remember that they have been around for more than twice that time. True North is yet another incredible CD, with songs that are both well crafted and deeply layered with thoughtful, relevant lyrics. The sound is predictably Bad Religion, but that is a good thing. If you are a fan, you cannot go wrong putting down a little money for this one.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I LOVE Batman and I was so excited to get all three movies together and for an excellent price!! The packaging was great and the movies as described.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|(This review is for the EXTENDED version, not the Blu-ray) I admit, I read quite a few of the 1 star reviews before I purchased this, but I thought I'd give it a chance.  Well, even though I purchased a used copy, i still spent too much.<br /><br />I don't want to be redundant about what's wrong with this mess of a film, but I will say that the attempt to retell  an old story was ridiculously pretentious and so far off the mark that I couldn't finish watching.  No, not even Charlize Theron could save this, and Kristen Stewart should get off the casting couch and learn a new trade.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I have not watched the movie as of now. However, the packing and the movie were as expected I was very pleased
B002Y7ZEMG|5.0|This movie is a must have for all Michael Jackson fans.  This movie has great special effects along with a personal view on how Michael feels about the pressure of the media.
B007L4HFDI|5.0|This was a good perchase for my husband. The movie came as expected and in the time that was said.

B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|What a coincidence that I was talking to a friend at the local record store just the other day about about how,in the last several years music in general seemed to be improving and gaining more depth. While we were referring specifically to more instrumental jazz,rock and soul the same is definitely starting to come true for pop music as well. Interesting though. Popular music,after all,ends up being something like chewing gum: it's strong at first but loses it's flavor slowly with time. That's especially true in an environment when popular music usually means overdressed female performers aggressively over-singing songs assisted mostly by auto-tune and other needlessly loud electronics,usually played and/or programmed in a rather juvenile fashion. Tegan And Sara have apparently been quite successful on the indie pop scene for a number of years now. Though I never heard there music outside a passing reference from time to time. But when I heard they were making a pop oriented record with Pink's producer Greg Kurstin,I wondered what was going to come of that so decided to pick this up.<br /><br />  The album opens with \\"Closer\\"-with it's punchy synthesizer's and danceable rhythmic sound the impression is something in the neighborhood of Madonna meets Belinda Carlisle. \\"Drove Me Wild\\",talking an even more uptempo look at things is a similarly well arranged dance-rocker as well. \\"Goodbye Goodbye\\",\\"I Was A Fool\\" and \\"Love They Say\\" take on a rather more nuanced musical approach-the former two very much more in the school of 3-chord indie guitar pop with some wonderfully recorded vocal harmonies and the latter with a mixture of atmospheric keyboards and a more rhythmic guitar attack. \\"I'm Not Your Hero\\" and \\"How Come You Don't Want Me\\" both build from a gentle and nuanced opening back into that dance/rock frenzy again. \\"On \\"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\\" that \\"big sound\\" Kurstin is so famous for getting (especially in the case of Pink) is prominent  in the rocked up dance arrangement. The album ends with the slower,almost trance dance styled \\"Now I'm All Messed Up\\" and the rhythmically slower,and somewhat funkier \\"Shock To Your System\\".<br /><br />  Working symbiotically with Kurstin Tegan and Sara accomplish something here that is a rare feat for modern pop artists looking to the music of the 1980's as a source for musical inspiration. Their entire approach to that form comes entirely from the concept that the pop music sound of the 80's was very much a production and compositional extension of classic 60's and 70's instrumentation and songwriting. The synthesizers and electronic instruments used in the arrangements of this album are completely melodic and flow ideally from the beginning of the song to the next. They never come off as purely gimmicky EDM-type pop at all. Not only that but Tegan and Sara both rely on their expressive,soaring singing style,two part and multi tracked vocal harmonies rather than any electronic device to make their voice sound inevitably more robotic. Along with the albeit more soul/jazz/funk oriented sound of newcomer Jessie Ware,the music of Tegan and Sara on this album represents a very welcomed return to live,organic yet studio-centric pop music.rangement.

0786962984|4.0|Dungeon! is a classic game the history of which predates D&D, though it wasn’t published until after D&D was. Invented by one of the players in Dave Arneson’s Blackmoor campaign and shown to Gygax during the same time that he was shown Blackmoor. This game actually influenced D&D.<br /><br />This version is pretty basic and lacks many of the expanded rules that fleshed the game out a bit. Still, it has the basics. It may seem mostly luck-based at first, but if you stick with it and learn some of the things that aren’t obvious at first, you’ll find winning strategies.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Well written screenplays, fascinating plots, and superb acting.  I have gotten through the first book and well, ya know, after re-watching the first season.... this is the first time I can say that there was very little depth added by reading the book, it's almost all in the series.... though subtle in places.  I really enjoy rewatching it to pick up those little details I missed, but it's there.  I'll see what I think after finishing the second book.  I cannot WAIT for season 3 !!!  George Martin better get busy, cuz judging from my colleagues and friends, this series is a real hit and HBO is gonna run out of books to produce.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's probably the best book in the world. Mixed with excitement and tragedies. It's definitely a good mixture for me.

B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Supernatural has gone from a show I thought I'd never watch, to one of the most addictive shows I have ever watched.  The first 5 seasons were fantastic, and it hasn't quite been the same since, but I have to see it through (because it was that good).  The writing is not as imaginative, and it often gives the impression they are trying too hard to be more gory, a little too hard to be as funny as in seasons past, and just missing the mark a bit on compelling story lines.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun game I have a high score it's really fun to play if it wasn't for my friends I would not play this game
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am additced to this game. So much fun and I can play for hours. Everytime I start playing I lose track of time.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and its great to compete against your friends on facebook. Super addicting and you don't have to pay extra to enjoy the full game. Highly recommended but very addicting
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Poignant from the first scene, by the end, when  the metaphor hinted at in the title is realized we have cheered, sobbed and remembered a game and a time that left a mark on our psyches. And if you're a woman it's probably a much different movie, but one you can't turn away from.
0062238868|5.0|god bless you chris kyle for insuring our freedoms in america---fantastic true story of americans fighting enemies then coming back home to continue to be of service to his friends returning from war---praying for his wife,children and family in this time of shock and sadness.
B000IDEORY|4.0|Good dancing, predictable story line, average acting.<br /><br />A fun watch, though. Music and dancing are great with an interesting assortment of characters.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoy games and this one is definitely full of action. I just haven't gotten very far yet because I don't turn my device the right direction
1884883303|5.0|If you buy, sell, or are just interested in Vintage guitars, this book is a must have. I have been reading this for years and will continue to do so.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I Figured that it would have more adult themes started reading and within the first few pages F bombs started flying.  Great.  Just what I wanted to read.  All that repressed profanity from 7 Harry Potter Books has taken its tole.  Just because a book is geared towards an adult audience does not mean that the language needs to be perverse.  It takes more talent to write without profanity.  Apparently, success does not breed class.  Good thing Ms. Rowling had ghost writers helping her with the Potter series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was so much fun and I love it. I am now addicted to my horse. The game is the Bomb-Diggity!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Although I can't play daily on my kindle like I did my cell phone, this is a very addictive game. It's cool to visit your neighbors restaurants and see their designs, tip, and gift them. The customers are some of the greediest folks I've ever seen ... Lol. Holiday themes as well as recipes are also incorporated. Just plain fun all around.
0425252868|5.0|One hears only the bad most of the time and here is a story of honor along with respect. A must read for anyone who seeks historical fact in the stories they read.
B003JHKORK|4.0|A few scary parts that would be scary for younger children. Definitely appropriate for older elementary and up. A movie the parents enjoy watching with the kids.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, great story line, I laughed and cried, classic movie, a must see
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I Thought I would be able to get online to bid and purchase items, instead I could only access my Ebay account to see what I was selling or bidding on with my computer.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I love this movie, great telling of this period of history and music, great actors, even Beyonce I thought did an excellent job in this film
0817439390|3.0|Not very informative from a advanced user perspective... although probably for a beginner.  Doesn't really cover all the ins and outs of exposure.  Kind of disappointed ..
030796664X|4.0|Not what I expected at all.  Very enjoyable and thought provoking.  I was in attendance at many of the Colts games referenced and am awed by what this book taught me about what the dynamics where behind the scenes.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Fell in love with this movie when it first came out.  Paid around $80 at the time for a Beta tape when Beta was the best.  Then a few years later bought a VHS tape.  Now, a DVD- quit changing the format please!  - costing me a lot to &#34;keep up with the times&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books are the closest anyone has come to writing about Vault life in the Fallout universe.  Amazing story that can lead to infinite stories in an amazing universe.  A Must Read for those who love end of the world stories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Similiar to Temple Run but I enjoy this much more! The missions are great and the daily challenge is an easy bonus. Recommend to ANYONE! :)
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was really sad when I was done.  This book would make great book club read!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Hands down this is the best show on TV. Writing, directing, acting top to bottom the best. We need more programs like this and no more reality TV.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a great way to pass the time while waiting for an appointment. I have whiled away many hours pleasantly while sitting in the doctor's office.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am an avid reader, and heart-felt love stories are by far my weakness.  This book was extraordinary.  The writing, the characters, the story, the twists; everything about this book keeps pulling you in.  When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it.  I even tried to stall in finishing it just so that it wouldn't end.  I definitely recommend this book to any reader who enjoys a book you can't put down.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I am absolutely obsessed with these games!! This one was awesome because it was almost like 2 games in one with the normal side and the evil side! I hope there are more of these kind of games coming very soon, especially with the point and click movements between places, all the games that have the same elements of this one are my absolute favorite, I wish there were more!!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|It will not download to my Kindle Fire!  Please advise me as to how to return this defective product . . .
B00913DPW2|3.0|I wish the hint would be a little more helpful, I'm currently stuck at one puzzle and there's no option to skip it and the hint was very vague. So therefore I can't move on and no matter how many times I pick it back up and try I just can't figure it out. Wish there was a skip.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|If you like action and adventure flims, you will love The Tourist. The Actors did great job, full of surprises, and very entertaining movie!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Perfect book. It was definitely worth buying. Now I just can't wait to see how the movie turns out. Amazing.
B006WPWH4E|4.0|Love this solitaire.  Only wish that it would automatically make moves when they present themselves......Otherwise, this is a great little game!
1451695195|5.0|This book appealed to me on all levels. Other books on NDEs bring religion (and usually one particular religion) into the mix which tends to alienate a large number of people. This book reaches out to every one with words of hope and love, no matter what your religious beliefs.
B006TLFPKO|1.0|ok I'm an older gal compared to most of the twilight fans, (early 40's) but I read the books and liked them.  Not ashamed to admit it.<br />I watched the movies and liked them too.  Except for this one.  I don't know what happened.  The story line while pretty exciting in the book was just so boooring and drawn out.  The acting while never Oscar worthy was especially bad in this one, unfortunately you kinda have to watch it in order to follow the story line.
B0083Z614S|5.0|When I was thinking about to buy or not this book, I trusted that it was a classic, so it would be a good deal. If it is realised that this is available for so many years, it is also clear that there is a reason to that be possible. The reason is - in my opinion - that this is not only a classic, but a great and well written one. It will be delightful to spend hours reading that so wonderful story!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and ...It never gets old.<br /><br />If you are a romantic like I am, this movie will take you away to a place of magic that only exists between two people that are truly connected for life. Their love is a love that could never die even when it was tested time and time again. I think it is hands down the best movie about true love that I have ever seen. I hope you will laugh and cry and feel every emotion that this story offers.
B000SEVVLK|2.0|Reading a book filled with shallow characters and flat story line- no thanks. I read this book for a book club and when we had our meeting, there was so little about the book to talk about we spent most of the book club time discussing other books we had read recently. Definitely skip if you're looking for something entertaining.
1401322786|1.0|I have been a great fan of Mitch Albom. Immensely loved each of his novels. I am sadly disappointed by his latest work,\\"The time keeper\\". The idea is good however it does not seem original to me. I do agree with the fact that one should value the time you have and not take it for granted etc. The plot however is very sketchy and stretched out. I will continue to read Mr. Albom's work but this was sadly a waste of my time.
B000002J23|3.0|As you already know, this is an album by a band called 'Yes' - but it was one of the few albums to lack lead singer Jon Anderson and one of the many to lack keyboardist Rick Wakeman. So, interestingly enough (and if you're reading this webpage you probably already know this) the gaps were filled by none other than The 'Video killed the radio star' Buggles, whose quirky disco-pop tune is still famous to this day.<br /><br />So, is this a 'yes' album or is it more pain for the radio star? Well, having listened to this album, I'd say that it was The Buggles out there to get some 'prog-cred', and they were more or less backed by Yes. The Yes Men were definitely not pushing Geoff Downes around the way they used to push Rick Wakeman around; his keyboards are very much a main part of this album, rather than a minor instrument in to add flavour. Trevor Horn does his best to sound like Jon Anderson.<br /><br />My biggest qualm with Yes is that they don't show a lot of respect to the vocals; it's like 'righto, here's a really complex piece of music, here's a lot of big words, you sing em really quickly so we can get onto those *important* instrumental passages... Jon Anderson is a very talented man and often you can understand his singing, even if he has to sing very fast, but it's a very big ask for just anyone, even if it is that long lost radio star.<br /><br />'Machine Messiah' is a big 10 minute epic with this version of the band out to prove their prog-chops, and this song is very prog, but it's a bit hard to understand the lyrics sometimes, though not too hard. I like the last two minutes of this song the best, but I didn't really enjoy the song. 'Does it really happen' is a more rocking song and it's a bit easier to understand the lyrics.<br /><br />'I am a camera' feels more like a 'Buggles' song - the song is built around the vocals, they're easier to understand, with a catchy chorus; it's like a Buggles song with a long, Yes-like instrumental section, while 'Run through the light' is a fun new-wave sort of song. The final song, 'Tempus Fugit' is a classic yes-sounding song, complete with very quick vocal delivery and wild Steve Howe guitar solos. The song very much feels like it's in a rush.<br /><br />Overall, an okay album but not worth opening a bottle of champagne.
B000001FS3|5.0|The producted was packaged well, was exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was in great shaped when received..
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I simply read all books and couldn't stop. I love the Stark family and the values they represent, as well the courage and determination of the dragon princess. In the story its hard to guess whats gonna happen, love the complex of the politics and how it always measuring whats its stronger honer or ambition which knows no limits.

B00466HM28|3.0|As a new music composer I was looking for something that would go along with Finale Songwriter.  I hooked up the Akai Pro Mini and no sound came out.  There is no manual to let you know how to set it up or a number to contact with questions.  I am sure eventually I will figure out how to use it, but I still can't get any sound to come out.

145552347X|2.0|This very small book with its very big print is a post mortem pot boiler. I was hoping for some of the famous Hitchens wit to spotlight questions of death and dying but instead we are given little snippets of some inconsequential and unedited raves. This publication was designed to cynically cash in on the Htichens reputation for intelligence and wit, but gives us too little of that. But at least there is no death bed conversion, atheists will be glad to hear if not surprised.

B0083Z614S|5.0|I remember reading this book when I was in Prep school and I loved it! I am now 20 years old and I was so happy I found the longer version of this book - I love this story!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the message of the book which was that your mind can either help you or harm you all because of your thoughts (therefore, perceptions).<br /><br />I love the themes, dialogue, setting and all the characters, I don't think I will ever get tired of this book no matter how old I am.
B0061S073A|5.0|So far this has been a great app to have to keep the kids from buying unwanted purchases and only lets them play the games I set. Have not had any problems, works just like it says.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|With Amazonl Mp3 you. only have buy a song once and it can be downloaded to multiple devices.They have a varied selection of music to choose from.

B009O07NDY|5.0|Very nice presentation booklet and the music is just great.<br />When you've seen the movie, you may go back into each scenes just by listening the music.

B00APJLFEG|3.0|First one I paid for.. Expected high quality like the free Prime instant offerings I've watched, but was disappointed with the grainy, almost SD picture quality
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I've played it a few times since downloading it.  It's a lot more interesting and challenging than the first Temple Run.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|i love his song called home, and a friend of mine told me the whole album was good. so i bought it and took a chance. and i'm amazed to say that i love it!!!!! the whole album is great.
0618918248|4.0|This is a thought-provoking book covering a wide range of topics concerning God, but is mostly about religion. I enjoyed Dawkins refutation of various claims which are made in favor of religion. In my opinion, Dawkins lays a strong case against organized religion. As for God, as Dawkins himself said, it is impossible to prove (currently) that God exists and it’s impossible to prove that He doesn’t exist. Therefore, he is rather agnostic regarding His existence. “The God Delusion” is an intriguing and informative book that ought to be read by believers and non-believers alike.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|i'm not big on remakes of classic movies but this one was actually worth buying. it was a great movie. very well done.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I wouldn't wish this trash on anyone. It was not going anywhere, and what we did watch was pure dribble. Don't bother getting it.
B004529NKC|5.0|i love this movie. as well as the first 2 step up movies. the characters and the story lines are creative and some of the dance moves are insane. never a dull moment in this movie
B009X011UQ|5.0|I love it but wonder if it will hold up well over a long period of time; also love the color
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall and Casino Royal are my two favorite James Bond movies. Daniel Craig is awesome, and so believable in this role. Hot Stuff!!
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Ill keep this review short and to the point. The movie has a great story, a positive message, and is fun to watch at all ages. It's not too scary for small kids and it has plenty of hidden jokes to keep adults laughing throughout the entire movie. It's also fun to identify all of the character voices and figure out which actor plays them. Most of the voice actors are celebrities we see on tv. So there you go short and the point. If you want the plot then see the trailer before you rent or buy the movie.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|The writers seemed to go out of their way to make this movie as vile as possible. The characters were unbelievable. The scenario was a non sequitur. I found the language so offensive that I could not watch it for more than 15 minutes.<br />.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2 but it just won't open when I want it to:( I have played it like once or twice
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy,has a great story line to it.But she needs to make more of these kinds of books.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Simply amazing! It is such a great comeback.  This concert is tasteful and classy. \\"Jezebel\\" is my favorite one. Sade is still the queen of British R&B and her band is just spectacular.
B007MU85D0|5.0|One of my new faves!  Mellow, but not boring.  Very original sound.  I don't find myself skipping songs, as i love the entire album, which is rare!  Great price, too.  :-)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Time travel is always an enjoyable subject for me. I had heard this book concerned President Kennedy but did not know it was about time travel. We as people always live with regret in our lives, so being able to change the future through alteration of events in the past is fun and happy to ponder while reading this book.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Picked this up when it was on sale for 40$. All films look and sound great, and are noticably better than their DVD counterparts.<br /><br />Raiders fares the worst of the bunch but still managers to look quite good. Temple and Crusade had a bigger budget and it shows in the presentation.<br /><br />These are some of my favorite films; its great to finally see them in high definition.
B001HC8516|5.0|I absolutely love this book and will 're-read as necessary.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU Liz and Greg.  Funny and a great dose of what we need to hear!!

0765325950|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, Sanderson has brilliantly succeeded in a nearly impossible task... completing this amazing series.<br />I found the book exciting, gripping, revealing, and of course very difficult to put down.<br />All the events we've long awaited (perhaps too long) are finally presented to us, spun out in a dazzling weave, and tied up into a satisfying (I thought) conclusion.
B0094LDZ9E|4.0|My two year old loved the music and dancing! The penguins are so darling. We will watch again for sure!

B004SIP9VA|5.0|I really like the actors first off.  But I also like watching the dancing.  This is a movie I will watch over and over again.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Wow what a wonderful end to a story. Enjoyed every minute. Carried me with great interest. Hope Stieg knows we all love his work.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Movie is a good tribute to World War II, although one would think 'nobody' smoked or drank back then-I so detest political correctness and revisionist history in Movies these days. Some hidden details in the movie if you keep a careful eye out, aka, encased 'Human Torch' body in the 'World of Tomorrow display. I do like how this movie uses the costume of the 40s serial as well as the redesigned one later.Great supporting actors, actresses, Tommy Lee Jones is awesome as the hard nosed Officer and Peggy was captain America's love interest. The actor for 'Bucky' was spot on as well as Dum Dum Dugan. The Red Skull actor was brilliant. I hope they find a way to have him return sometime.<br />Very patriotic movie if you are an American,go see this. If not, then liberals can enjoy Harry Potter films or something.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This showcased Neeson's talents and was a thriller throughout, we liked it. Not sure why we had to pay $2.99 to watch it, especially since Taken 2 is free right now on Amazon Prime.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Lots of action in this movie. It was better than I thought it would be. Mickey Rourke pulls off a very convincing villain. However, I was dismayed to see Tony Stark reduce himself to being the a-hole he was before the war accident. The whole idea of 'Iron man' was that he changed his ways after coming close to death. Eventually we kind of see why he goes off the bend and Tony does turn himself around ,although he almost loses all his friends doing so. Hammer Industries CEO was really cheeky and some of his antics reminds me of OCP in the film, 'RoboCop'. I am still glad i watched this finally. Probably worth 3 stars but I give it 4 because the movie does have some great content: Suitcase Amour, references to the comic book,aka the automobile logo in Morocco Race, and some back story with his Father, Howard Stark. Iron Man perseveres in the end.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Such an amazing series! We are HOOKED!<br /><br />But beware - it is dark, depressing and pretty violent. Not for the faint of heart or emotionally fragile. Definitely NOT a feel good series...<br /><br />Awesome writers, amazing music, and great cast.<br /><br />Long live Walter White!
1451695195|5.0|Thought provoking and reassuring that there is life after death!  His account of his NDE reads like fiction,<br />but contains vivid details and explanations of  the whole experience.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Puzzles that are challenging enough to require multiple tries and a little bit of head scratching, but not so challenging that they'll have you quit in frustration. Took several play sessions to complete. Looking forward to more levels being released.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son wanted these legos because he's crazy about the online game of mindcraft. These were perfect for those days when he couldn't play online. :) 4 stars because it is a bit expensive for a rather small set, however, it does have TONS of tiny little pieces so I suppose it's priced adequately as far as legos go.
B0038VPB5W|1.0|IT JUST DOES NOT PACK THE PUNCH THAT THE PREVIOUS ALBUMS HAD.. SAF WAS THE TURNING POINT ALTHOUGH I ENJOYED THE ALBUM, I NOTICED THE DIFFERANCE IN THE SOUND. I REALY ENJOYED HAND OF BLOOD AND THE POISON BUT I SEE NOW THAT THE EDGE THEY HAD FROM THOSE TWO ALBUMS IS LONG GONE AND NOW THEY HAVE MORE OF A COMMERCIAL SOUND.  I GAVE THE ALBUM A FEW TRIES BUT I JUST DONT CARE FOR IT, JUST BORING TO ME REALLY.. I STILL LIKE BFMV AND STILL LISTEN TO THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS BUT AS FAR AS THE NEW BFMV EGHHHH YEA I JUST CANT GET INTO THE MUSIC..
0307361012|3.0|The Bat is the first Harry Hole thriller, and Nesbo's first novel length publication also. While quite a good police procedural there are a flew problems that halt this book short of being awesome<br />(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />The story finds Harry sent to Australia to investigate the violent death of a Norwegian celebrity. The expectation is that he will do some per-functionary liaising with Sydney police, sight-see then return to Olso. None too surprisingly Harry finds himself not only drawn into the case but also a personal relationship with a colleague and friend of the victim.\<br /><br />Nesbo explores Aboriginal myth and 'King's Cross' culture quite deeply adding strengthening the book substantially. While starting pretty slow, Harry's suddenly but inevitable plunge into a bottle revs the pace and drama of the book. I like Nesbo's technique of bringing in other characters perspective's while Harry is on a bender - it somehow adds to the tension of knowing Harry is really messed up.<br /><br />As promised there are some flaws (aside from being a little slow starting) - MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />First there is a fight scene which is just awkward slapstick - Harry approaching some thugs and taunts them into punching his head, whereupon he gleefully shows them a tooth knocking from his jaw. At times Harry also doesn't present as the jaded alcoholic he claims to be. In fact most of the time he presents as humorous and witty. Not that these character traits don't necessarily fit together its just that often Harry's dialogue suggests he is a grim old man immune to humour and fun.<br /><br />Second there is a part of the final climax which is not only clich&eacute; but completely impossible to believe could happen SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Harry convinces his girlfriend and police buddies to let her wear a wire and approach the suspected murderer in an attempt to make him accidentally admit something. Not only is this incredibly unlikely to happen at all and predictably leads to the girlfriends capture, it is also weakened by the fact that Harry has begun to suspect the suspect isn't the true murderer anyway.<br /><br />The final weakness is the antagonist. I won't say too much, only that the character introduced early on does not fit at all with the character presented as the murderer (without excuse)<br /><br />Despite these somewhat major flaws, The Bat is a strong story nonetheless and Nesbo certainly knows how to pen a high-stakes tale that does not pull any violence or character death, or the alcohol debauchery of the protagonist.ably leads to the girlfriends capture, it is also weakened by the fact that Harry has begun to suspect the suspect isn't the true murderer anyway.<br /><br />The final weakness is the antagonist.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|I had trouble with the writing style due to the poor grammar of the main character (but based on his upbringing it was very appropriate). I read very fast, so I had to slow down to fully grasp what he was trying to say at first. I got used to it after awhile. think that Emma Dooghue did a great job of bringing the story full circle. I couldn't have ever imagined that they would get out of &#34;Room&#34;, never mind how they did it and what happened after.

B00AFEXRME|3.0|Flight(released Oct/12)stars Denzel Washington as William \\"Whip\\" Whitaker,John Goodman as Harling Mays,Don Cheadle as Hugh Lang,Bruce Greenwood as Charlie Anderson,and many others in this nice tight cast of acting veterans and new comers.The story starts out with a bang but the rest of the film is taken up with the protagonist wrestling with both inside and outside demons.I saw this film in theatres and I knew from the get go it would elicit a variety of reactions.On one level Washington is bringing in close to an OSCAR winning performance.On the other the story,as good as it seems,works against him throughout.<br />The story finds Denzel as a flight captain.The movie starts in a rather shocking manner as he wakes up beside,as it turns out,a good looking stewardess and snorts a line of cocaine.Off he goes to pilot a passenger plane,having some vodka and OJ along the way.Just before landing approach time,the plane runs into severe turbulence.Denzel takes the controls and the upshot is,through his amazing piloting skills,while the plane crashes in a field,only six lives are lost.Denzel lays in a hospital bed and is visited by the NTSB and his union rep.Also someone comes along(Goodman)who we at first think is quite the flamboyant friend,but turns out to be his go to drug connection.While there he meets up with a red head who also has been going through her own hell with booze and drugs.<br />Denzel meets with the union rep and their lawyer,then the airline boss.This sends Denzel into the deep end and again he is drinking like a fish.Drunk he seeks out the redheads apartment,who it happens,is just getting kicked out.He offers his residence to crash in and and they end up closerthanthis.The investigation starts getting hot and heavy which sends Denzel heading for more drink and drugs from his pusher.This also pushes his girl friend to the limit,who leaves.Denzel has an emotional meeting with his ex and his son,who doesn't really know or want to know his alcoholic father.<br />The union and their lawyer only can do so much,and a formal hearing is held.Time and again his union has tried to get him sober,and gets all the promises from Denzel,but he never fails to disappoint.This time,of all times,is no different.With the help of his pusher he is \\"sobered\\" up and attends the hearing.All Denzel has to do is lie,as he has all along,about whether or not he had been under the influence of any substances or drink that flight.His team is expecting a \\"no\\",but Denzel cannot take it any longer and says \\"yes\\".The \\"hero\\" pilot goes to jail.The film ends as a now sober Denzel,in the can,meets with his son and reconciles,apologizing for all the years of hurt and pain he has caused.<br />I found the opening scene with Denzel in bed,a little \\"raw\\" for my taste,but I could see what the director was aiming for as far as realism goes.Then comes the titled\\"flight\\" and it is gripping.Afterwards,the emotional ride we just experienced starts to quickly wane as Denzel recovers,then slowly but surely the film shifts its focus from pilot hero,to a drug and booze soaked man with alot of inner demons.The fact that Denzel was one of only a few who could have done what he had done gets pushed aside as Denzel spirals ever downward.The rest of the film turns into a look at the sordid life and the extremes people in Denzel's state will go to to maintain their habit/addiction.Alongside this is his girlfriend who has gone through what he has experienced too,and we watch as she is able to overcome her problems,and Denzel sinks ever deeper.The pace never changes too much as we switch back and forth between watching Denzel abuse himself,to his on off relationship with the red head and to his legal problems.This,it seems,is the films real focus,the flight was just the catalyst for the events to come.And it is a long and windy road we go down;some of it interesting,but most I found a bit ponderous,with a been there,done that feel in so far as the addiction part goes.It wasjust dressed up prettier.This is an approximately 2 1/2 hr.film after all.As I said in the beginning I could see a lot of divergent opinions about this.Some will concentrate just on Denzels fine performance,while others will dislike it for its pace and length.Personally I am torn,as both sides have a point,and that is why I'm falling somewhere in the middle here.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.<br />All in all a good film but saddled with a terrible length and slow pace after the initial flight takes place.Denzel turns in a good performance but the film itself works against him,I thought, far too much.3 1/2 stars.just

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got this app for free as Amazon's app of the day a couple weeks ago, and it's pretty much perfect for white noise, with a great variety of soothing sounds. My favourite is the fire crackling noise- I let it run in the background while I browse and read on my kindle :)
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I haven't looked up Ernest Cline yet. I am almost afraid to. I would be willing to be my last dollar that he is a white, 40-something college-educated male. If he's not, then Mr. Cline is frighteningly talented since he would then be performing a pitch perfect imitation.<br /><br />If you are a man of a certain age (early to mid-40s), this book will likely give you provide you with a nostalgic smile on almost every page. The plot, such as it is (it's not the book's strong point - neither are the characters), is a delivery mechanism for myriad '80s pop culture references, delivered with love and reverence for the source material. Highly recommended, especially if you are among the target demographic cohort.
0525478817|5.0|I picked this book up in a bookstore when I had an hour to kill ... I hadn't heard anything, and had no expectations.<br /><br />It was truly phenomenal.<br /><br />As one can see from then &#62;2,000 previous reviews, I'm jumping on a bandwagon. But this story really managed to reorient how I think about life and death (and I'm finishing medical school, planning on a career specializing in palliative care, so this is something I've thought about).<br /><br />Clearly, I can't speak eloquently ... So, read this!

Recommended for families with kids between 4 and 12.

B009PU2SX8|5.0|First let me say I love Gary Clark Jr. I have been looking forward to his first full length cd since I first heard Bright Lights & When My Train Pulls In. At first listen I will admit I wasn't sure I liked the cd, yes there were a couple of standout songs, but not what I was expecting. After listening to it several times now...I have more appreciation for Gary Clark Jr. I was thinking it would be this in your face debut blues album, but it is so much more than just that. Gary shows his versatility throughout the cd. I am definitely a fan and look forward to hearing more from him. (I originally gave his cd 3.5 stars, but after listening to it more it grew on me. It deserves 5 stars in my book. Don't try to pigeon hole Gary's genre, he shows here he can cross those lines easily.<br /><br />Now if he would just come close enough to me so I could see one of those killer shows of his...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Because we have a busy schedule, we don't watch a great deal of television.  This was recommended to us by friends.  Thankfully, Amazon has all 3 seasons available for instant download.  I went through all three seasons in less than 2 weeks and am looking forward to season 4.  I'm disappointed that all the characters will not be returning, but it is understandable that actors will move on to other pursuits.  It's well worth a look and if you enjoy it like we did, it will be like one of those books you just can't put down.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book. Read it every chance I could and cannot wait to begin the next one!
030758836X|1.0|I enjoyed the beginning of this book, with the back and forth between the husbands current situation and the \\"diary\\" of Amy. When I got to the middle of the book (revealing no twists), I thought that this book was going to get really good.. what a dynamic twist, well-written. I think there was so much time spent developing the characters and the situations, that when it got to the end it was as if the author forgot who they were. There is NO WAY those people would have actually ended up like that. What a COMPLETE and UTTER disappointment to watch what could have been an amazing ending, some good spy craft and a nice setup, but no...... (spoiler alert) after all that is done, the end result is that they \\"complete each other in their absolute disfunction that even though I might get brutally murdered at any moment, it's totally the way to go... \\" Really??????? The hatred between these two is so well documented that this ending seemed so false and thrown together. Using hatred and fear as motivation to stay in a deadly situation because at least you're present??? Ugh... HORRIBLE... completely wasted my time on this book.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This is a great page turner. There are twists and turns and the reader is never sure what is real. The story may become slightly too convoluted as it contrives a little too hard to twist and then twist again. A surprising insight - well for a non-American - is the desperation and desolation that the recession has caused for many ordinary Americans.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is my forth time re reading this book. Marcus I still cry about how you lost your friends- and amaze at God's grace. Thanks you for doing what you did to make it home and tell what happened.
B005LAIHCW|5.0|I was surprised when I watched this movie, after seeing so many mixed reviews. This movie is very entertaining and if your a horror fan like me, there is a few well placed jump scares! So glad I got it, this is something I will proudly add to my movie collection!
B000286S8S|3.0|Definately a Best of Sammy Hagar with a few of the DLR hits. I don't mind that so much because I enjoy the Sammy Hagar period of VH. It's definately a different sound, but with plenty of its own merits. But if it's labeled best of both worlds, you'd think there would be a pretty equal output from both SH and DLR. The worst thing about this album is Disc 1 Track 6 \\"Finish What You Started\\" extremely abrutly ends; no fade out, no resolve, just boom it's over.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down! Bought it last night and finished it today. Sad it ended.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is a fun and intriguing game. You have to keep up with it and keep your horse healthy and happy, just like having a real horse. You get occasional challenges that are optional. I enjoy the extra challenge.. You also can train your horse for competitions and if u compete you can win money. And with money you can treat your horse or buy accessories for it. You are limited by your energy. You can buy more with gems you've earned, or wait and it does rebuild. Even if you don't have energy there is still stuff to do. And I got this game for free, so I can't complain too much about that. They do have to make money somehow.

B00000K0T8|5.0|I recommend this product to anyone who hates new (pop) rap and wishes lyricists still existed.<br />One of those CDS you listen to all the way through and cant pick a favorite or worst track because they all flow so well.
B00BB9PVQM|2.0|The characters are good, acting is good, however, this is a graphic, gory television show. The carnage detracts from the story. I wonder how long it will be before some sick person wanting attention starts to copy the crimes in shows like this one and Criminal Minds.

B005LAII12|4.0|At its best this is a hit or miss tale and it's worst it's a waste of your time. What you decide will pretty much boil down to your taste in humor but I will add that if you are a fan of \\"Family Guy\\" you will find at least parts of this comedy engaging.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays a guy named John who wished for a friend of his own as a child and got it in a teddy bear that came to life. It was big news back in the day but not society has cynically accepted it and moved on. Anyway, they're the best of friends but now that Johnny is 35 and with his 4 year old girlfriend (played by Mila Kunis) his teddy bear's hedonistic focuses are cramping Johnny's love life and future. What are ya gonna do when your teddy bear pal is doing drugs and has hordes of hooker traffic in and out of his place? Of course there are a variety of problems but I don't wish to give spoilers away.<br /><br />Also starring Joel McHale (of \\"The Community\\"), Ryan Reynolds, Tom Skerritt (more of a cameo) and Giovanni Ribisi (as the villain).<br /><br />Yes, that's Nora Jones as herself and yeah that's Patrick Stewart as the narrator.<br /><br />Spoilers below.<br /><br />The budget for this pictures was roughly $60M and contrary to naysayers who felt this picture was horrible they're most likely being ignored as this picture made over $522M at the Box Office.<br /><br />HUMOR: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: end of January 2013.<br /><br />SPOILER: I liked how this picture didn't do the typical \\"your childish lifestlye cannot coexist with our love relationship\\" that is common in the diluted Hollywood rom com pics. This one let the the lover and the friend coexist with the main character.<br /><br />TOP THREE SCENES: John and Ted fighting with the TV dropping on his private parts; the appearance of Flash Gordon with the music and Ted's hot yet slutty girlfriend who \\"helps\\"him keep getting promoted at the supermarket.

B009YQJ322|4.0|This movie is very good and deserves more than the viewing it got in the theaters.<br /><br />Dredd is back and much grimmer than when Sly played him in an earlier version of Judge Dredd. The humor is gone as this movie settles into a dark and foreboding future of a world mostly wasted beyond ruin and a concentrated mass of humanity in what are known as mega cities (800 million people and 17,000 crimes per day). But don't worry for the judges are here to run things playing judge, jury and executioner and being allowed to kill people on site for violating various laws.<br /><br />Tale opens with Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban) being given the task of training a rookie with psychic powers named Anderson (played by Olivia Thirlby) who failed her exam to become a judge. She gets one more chance training under judge.<br /><br />And thus do they come to investigating a drug den in a highrise. Guess what? Not surprisingly it's worse than they thought and the villains seal them in and try to wipe them out. Minor spoiler but I'm adding some details so that it might sound enticing enough to watch.<br /><br />Judge Dredd creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of Dredd. He said: \\"I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd ... Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson ... The character and storyline are pure Dredd.\\" (Wiki)<br /><br />Screenwriter Alex Garland started working on the script in 2006.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $45M and it made just a bit over $36M at the Box Office. Quite a disappointment from what some were expecting. However, it did well with home media and because it pushed over $50M gross a trilogy is in the works or so Garland claimed.<br /><br />SOUND/MUSIC: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING:B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2013.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I wasn't sure if this was going to just be a teen romance when I started reading with the conflicted relationship between the two main characters.  Fortunately I kept reading, because there are a lot of twists and turns that make the book hard to put down.  I bought the book because it was a top seller on Kindle & I know why so many people are reading the novel - it is a great escape read and would definitely make a good book to turn into a film someday.  I can't discuss too much more without giving things away - would recommend though for an involving, suspense filled read.
B0011MZOEI|3.0|I'm a big fan of this series.  That said, the original film left such a high bar, it's hard to touch that.  I guess I look at it like this:  Die Hard was a great film.  The rest are great action films.

057809665X|5.0|This is a short but simple, step by step explanation of what to do, how to do it, and why.  I suspect people who are already good at interpersonal communication will scratch their heads and wonder why this book even exists.  Then there's people like me....I'd *almost* rather plunge shards of glass into my eyes than try to strike up a conversation with a stranger.  After reading this book, I can see very clearly how and why these steps would work, but the concept is so alien to me that I probably can't make myself do it.  It will still improve my ability to respond to the efforts of others to converse, however, as well as give me greater appreciation for the effort involved.

B005HP2JAM|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but I found this a bit boring after about 20 minutes. I also seemed to have a bit of trouble with the 3d aspect<br /> off the dvd. It would show it in 3d then stop being in 3d .  then you would get a message along the bottom of the screen saying it has detected a 3d signal and to push the 3d button. I basically did that for the next 45 minutes turning the glasses off and on as welll . I am hoping that this was just a dvd problem and not my new tv or dvd player. Also I found the background music hard to take
B008KOTNVA|5.0|After purchasing a couple of other lower quality screwdriver sets, I noticed how important it is to actually have a high quality set.<br />Bad drill bits actually wear away extremely quickly, and even worse, they sometimes strip the screws. And that is not something you want to happen, especially with your precious and expensive electronics like in my case, my Macbook Pro.<br /><br />Since I bought the new Retina Macbook, I already needed a new drill bit (pentalobe) to be able to open it up.<br /><br />So I decided to buy this one and haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />High quality build and extensive selection of drill bit shapes and sizes.<br /><br />Did not strip any of my Macbook screws and I am happy about that.<br /><br />The case is a little on the cheap side but I don't think that should be relevant to your buying decision

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Another Grisham novel that I enjoyed but found very predictable.  A good airplane or beach book for you to read on a vacation.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I love this book, as does my daughter. The reusuable &#34;stickers&#34; are similar to window clings, they do not stick to the walls or carpet, and can be placed over and over again. This is a great quiet activity as well.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It looks like a great app but after trying to download it twice it wouldn't open so had to  remove it from my kindle
B0083Z614S|4.0|My wife was amazed that I,an avid 57 year old reader, had never read this book.  I' glad that I finally did.  It shoes the power of positive thinking and how this quality van make a major change in one' s life.  My only complaint is that I thought they ending to be a bit abrupt.  Otherwise great read!
B007Y36K46|5.0|This movie may not be a Hollywood blockbuster but I believe it was a reasonable interpretation of Mr. Burroughs John Carter story. I liked the movie and recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic science fiction!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|AWESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME.  The best book I've read in a long time.  Throughout every page I couldn't wait until I could read again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was fortunate enough to find a youtube version of the 2003 original \\"Wicked\\" with Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth and Leo Norbert yesterday and watched it. Even having read the book, I was blown completely away, and the music and certain twists add to it. Not to mention, the cast was SO amazing...<br /><br />It was at once hilarious, touching and intellectual. It really makes you think, giving layers you would not have thought possible to characters that have existed for over seventy years. (And, miss Menzel could not hide her beauty under all the witch makeup-- she may have been the most comely \\"Wicked\\" witch Oz has seen.) I know this was 2003, but I JUST was able to find it, and wish they'd get the original cast back together to make a movie version, because we all know we want to see it, and see it with THEM, hearing THEM sing these great songs and saying these words, which wouldn't sound right coming in other voices.<br /><br />The two revelations at the end about Elphaba and Fieyro... oh! Brilliant, and I never thought I'd be rooting for the witch... but you are. And the music, oh, the songs just MAKE it so... Whoever adapted Mr. Maguire's book into a play made something that was really cool into something AMAZING, and they should be lauded on high.

This one P8Z77-V PRO is great, for overclocking i5 3570 past 4,5GHz , for the great software included, the WIfi, the accesories. The quantity of Usbs, Fan Headers, SATAs, the Bios is great. Is an excellent Motherboard for the Ivy or Sandy´s Intel CPUs...

B0011U8NZ2|5.0|I love each and every song sung by the Doors! I was just a young woman when they were popular and did not pay much attention to them. The ironic thing is that I was living in Germany when they were there and to this day I wish I had gone to see them! They were awesome!
B00683JK9K|2.0|The app seems to be very slow and laggy, making it hard to control. I never could get the double tap to rotate to work. This was too difficult and frustrating to continue with, uninstalled. Might be good on a better phone though, I tried it on a Motorola Droid X.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|If you like quick reads. This book.is not for you. What i loved so much about this book are getting to know the characters and how they grow on you. The ending of a book never made me emotional like this one. Its an amazing read narrated by death which makes this book so different from the rest. Without a doubt the best book i've ever read!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Red Country is typical of Abercrombie books to weave old and new characters. Certainly some pleasant surprises for me in the characters that were there, and I hope for more of the same in future. There were typically some very funny and horrible parts of the book, but overall really made you think about the humanity of the characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Downton Abbey will appreciate the quality of the presentation on the Kindle Fire.  The ability to repeat portions and view it at one's own time is a plus.  I'm so pleased that Kindle Fire offers this particular show.
0394800184|4.0|Are You My Mother, a simple, well-loved classic, opens with a mother bird sitting on her egg.  When the egg begins to move, she leaves to find some food for her anticipated baby.  In her absence, the egg hatches, and the hatchling sets out in search of his mother.  He asks a kitten, a hen, a dog, and a cow if they are his mother, and each says \\"no.\\"  He sees a car, a boat, and an airplane, is disappointed that none of them are his mother either.  Finally, he finds a construction digger, which he calls a Snort.  The digger lifts him high in the air, frightening him terribly, then drops him back into his nest where he meets his mother returning home.<br /><br />This is a great read-aloud for preschoolers, who will identify with the baby bird's fear at being separated from his parents.  Its pacing is wonderfully predictable, with not-very-scary tension building to an exciting climax with the \\"Snort,\\" and transitioning quickly to a deeply reassuring ending as the baby bird snuggles into the nest with his mother.  It's also a good easy reader, although a student who has had the book read aloud in preschool may view it as babyish.  I recommend the full paperback or hardback version rather than the abridged board book, which loses much in the abridging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great stuff very fun especially the Rio version. Though it is harder to get a high score on the kindle fire.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My young grandson introduced me to Angry Birds and it's quite addictive.  For Star Wars aficionados, this version is especially fun as the birds resemble many of the main characters and have similar powers.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Remember please, not what WE think, but what the kids think; great movie that they don't have nightmares from folks!!
B0058YPL66|5.0|Being that I always enjoyed fairy tales, Once Upon a Time sounded like an interesting show so I got the DVD. I have NOT been disappointed. I have been really pleased. Such a nice change - very refreshing - from the usual shows on television.  For me, personally, it is one of those rare shows where I can get totally absorbed (and forget about the rest of the world) and want to see more. I won't say it will do that for everyone, however. It is very entertaining and well done. I'm looking forward to getting the second season, and hope it is as good as the first season.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|I think it was the blanket characterization of the woman with grenade as evil that illuminated the emptiness<br />and unreflective  quality of mind of the writer that repelled me. As if war could be only black and white,the good vs. the bad. The end of this mans life was as senseless as the war he glorifies.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|Zack Snyder has gained notoriety for his extremely visually-appealing films.  If there's something you can't say about his movies is that they don't look pretty.  When Sucker Punch was being marketed, people wowed at the looks of the movie, but they were mostly at odds at what to think at what little they knew about the film's plot.  Some people didn't care, because they knew they'd at least be entertained, while others pointed out that Snyder's most famous and best films have been adaptations, while this story was wholly original, and they didn't trust Snyder had what it takes to write a compelling story.<br /><br />When the movie was released it was inmediately panned by most critics and audiences.  I admit that was the reason I didn't go see this film in theaters.  Heck, even after I purchased the Blu Ray I let it sit there for weeks until I got the courage to watch it.  Everyone complained about the fantastic visuals being wasted in a poor story with bad characters.  On the one hand, it gave me hope, since it would mean people would finally be taking into account good stories in their films instead of just the visuals.  On the other hand, it gave me pause, since except for this particular event, people kept and still keep proving to this day that movies with terrible stories and awful characters are still successful, even with visuals much weaker than the ones in this film, or even terrible (for instance, the Twilight series).<br /><br />What happened then?  Why is that movies with worse elements had been less despised, or even loved?  Sometimes you can suffer from very bad marketing (like Green Lantern did), sometimes you'll have people believing so hard a movie will fail that they'll be conditioned to dislike it even after watching it (like happened to The A-Team).  And sometimes... sometimes a movie will simply be terribly misunderstood.  This is, I believe, what happened to Sucker Punch.<br /><br />I got this movie's Blu Ray on a whim, and I have to say, I don't regret having purchased it, and I do regret not having seen it on a theater.  The visuals are fantastic, period.  You know that, going to a Zack Snyder movie.  The story, though, can be confusing to the point of people not believing there's actually one.  Reading a bunch of reviews, I can see were the reviewers are coming from, but it looks like they didn't consider a movie that looked this good could have a good story and they didn't really bother to look for it.  On the other hand, I only saw the extended cut, and maybe the theatrical cut is harder to understand.  In any case, there's absolutely no doubt that lots of people failed to understand it, for one reason or another.<br /><br />Emily Browning plays the protagonist, a girl whose mother died and left her and her sister everything in her will.  Her stepfather, mad at that fact, decides to kill the daughters, starting with the younger one.  Emily's character escapes, gets hold of the stepfather's gun, wounds him but accidentally kills her sister (this part is ambiguous, the sister might be dead before she arrives, but there's no question she blames herself for her sister's death).  The stepfather takes this as an opportunity and interns her in an asylum, claiming she went insane and secretly paying a shady employee to get her a lobotomy.  Five days later, as the procedure is about to start, we get to see the story of those five days unfold as a fantasy inside her head.  That story involves her plan to escape the brothel with a bunch of other girls she befriends.<br /><br />Yes, a brothel.  As it happens, those five days are set in a brother instead of the asylum.  Why?  Well, you see, it's heavily implied (make no mistake, this movie's story doesn't hold your hand, that's one of the main reasons so many people misunderstood it) that the girls in the asylum are victims of rape.  The brothel fantasy makes the protagonist put some sense into a situation that's already happening without the girls' consent.  She knows they're having sex with strangers, but in her fantasy, they're not being forced, they're choosing to do it.  Also, the fantasy replaces her lobotomy with the loss of her virginity.  As an aside, she and her friends go by codenames, like Rocket, Blondie or Sweet Pea.  The protagonist goes by Baby Doll.<br /><br />After saving a girl from a tragedy, Baby Doll befriends her and her pals and devises a plan to escape, thanks to the one element of the movie that can be attributed to supernatural forces instead of mere fantasy: a guardian angel, an instructor, a wise man.  The plan involves getting a bunch of items from the asylum/brothel, which are stolen by her friends while she distracts the staff by dancing.  You see, Baby Doll can dance so wonderfully she mesmerizes everyone who watches.  Now, people who watch this and take it literally might (and will) scoff at the concept, but you have to realize that, leving aside the fact that this is a fantasy, the rating (PG-13) won't allow them to mention what's REALLY happening.  \\"Dancing\\" is code for, depending who you ask, either \\"stripping\\" or \\"having sex\\".  This is a brothel, of course it wouldn't make any sense to have a girl dancing fully clothed and that somehow being so good to distract everyone around.  Then again, since the entire five-days wait is for her to \\"lose her virginity\\" I'd say sex is out the question in the fantasy brothel.  I believe the easiest way to explain what happens is this: in the real world (asylum) she's having sex to distract people while her friends steal the items, while in the fantasy world (brothel) she's either stripping or masturbating (or both) while her friends steal the items, but this is called \\"dancing\\" for the purposes of keeping the PG-13 rating.<br /><br />In any case, you'd realize that neither of those would be a good fantasy for her to have while the stealing happens, so she replaces that with a Inception-style fantasy within a fantasy.  Every time she has to \\"dance\\" her mind switches to an alternate steampunk world where she and her friends are a group of sword-wielding gun-totting monster-bashing fighters on a mission to obtain an item that's a representation of whatever item in the real world they're out to obtain.  The best action of the film happens on these sequences, which are visually stunning and stylistic.  Every time the sequence ends and they obtain the item, we go back to the brothel, where Baby Doll stops \\"dancing\\" while her friends have the real item in their hands.<br /><br />So, as you can see, the film borrows heavily from a couple of known movies, such as The Matrix, Inception or Shutter Island.  The problem with the back-and-fort between fantasies is that it probably confuses some people who are not used to movies not telling them exactly what's going on.  I have to say, you might have to watch it more than once to get what's really happening.  I don't think it will be necessary, since I only saw it once and understood it perfectly, but you can clearly see by reading the reviews of the theatrical release that A LOT of people didn't understand it.<br /><br />I will concede a couple of points for the early reviews, though.  Despite this supposedly being a fantasy inside a girl's head, visually it's definitely a male fantasy.  Hot girls in skimpy outfits, doing cool, stylized moves with swords and guns while doing sexy poses is not something most girls would fantasize about.  And, of course, the story isn't very original (as I said, it borrows heavily from other films).  So, it's Sucker Punch a female-empowerment tale?  Not really.  Is it demeaning to girls, then?  No, not that either.  Is it all style and no substance?  No, the substance is there, but sometimes the style will distract you from seeing it.  Is it a bad film?  No.  It's not a fantastic film either, but it's definitely a good one.he knows they're having sex with strangers, but in her fantasy, they're not being forced, they're choosing to do it.

B007ZTLLMK|4.0|It is a fun interesting game. I cannot complain too much since I bought it as the free app of the day.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Acting and story line were subpar. Action scenes started out pretty strong but became pretty redundant.  Also, it may or may not bother you, but there sure was a lot of swearing. The original was much better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good app, I had no problems with it at all. There are pop ups between games, but it wasn't bothersome.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very fun game, although it sometimes freezes and/or makes me force close. It downloaded well enough and I love playing it with my friends and family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun! I absolutely love it! I play it fairly often and it keeps you fairly busy...it's hard to play one round without playing another
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Fun game, although I wished it had more recent songs in cloud sharing. Other than that, it's great. My favorites are Adele's &#34;Someone Like You&#34; and the Harry Potter theme. (:
0470474874|5.0|The book has a lot of detailed reference for the use of Excel 2010. If you are a quantitative job searcher, then Excel is a basic programming skill you should possess. What a great purchase from Amazon. 5-star has already been rated.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This morning I decided to play it for a few minutes. I had played it just the day before and all my coins were there. Well, today ... not so much. All my coins were gone, my characters locked, and I went down from x30 to x1. What happened? The only thing that remained was my Facebook info, which fortunately included my high score. Still fun, though.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|For teen fiction, I like the series. Don't go into it expecting literature, and you're fine. It's an addicting series; you want to know what happens next.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love playing it. I play it with my friends, my family, and even random people. The drawings are sometimes hard to guess but easy to draw!
B0001XALTG|5.0|This is a movie that is so heavily referenced that I finally could not ignore it.  I was tracking down the work of Mary McDonald after watching The Decoy Bride (a real treasure), and learnt that she was in Trainspotting and that nailed it down for me.  So, I bought it and, yes the drug use is off-putting, and the intensity is searing.  I have been a fan of Johnny Miller and he was really good in this (I was not so keen on the Flying Scotsman, though).  It is definitely one of those movies I will watch often.
B0086700CM|2.0|I got it and within an hour I deleted it. It was boring. I like &#34;Subway Surfers&#34; way more. :)
B005LAIGF0|3.0|So, I was inspired to seek out and purchase this Blu-ray Disc/DVD combo because, well the way it is written it looks like the extended version is also on Blu-ray as well as the theatrical version.  I heard a movie reviewer summing up 2012's best movies and he cited the release of the extended cut of Margaret as perhaps his best movie of the year.  I had seen in theater the other movies he listed.  He had made a point to mention that the original theater release was not at all interesting and that the only version worth viewing was the Blu-ray.  I was quite dismayed to learn that the extended version was on a DVD and the original theater release was on Blu-ray.  So, I buy this combo pack thinking I am going to get to see a really good movie on Blu-ray and it was not going to happen.  Big disappointment.  Did watch Margaret on DVD.  Interesting.  I might use the Blu-ray as a coaster.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It let me tweet live during an event and I can even use it without wifi to read older tweets & look through my photos. I cannot tweet without wifi, though.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The disc came two days before the movie started and I held off listening to the disc until I had seen the movie.  I was blown away by the movie.  I was at first a bit curious about Russell Crowe as Javert and the more I listen to the disc and the second time I saw the film, I got it that he was probably the best choice.  There are favorite tracks.  I often hit replay on 20 and 17.  I thought that I would wear out 5 with the Dream song and while it is one of the most evocative songs ever, how much emotional pain can someone endure and still get to work ready to face the day?  I have the disc from the Broadway version and while it is more complete, this is better.  I am overwhelmed with the feeling that is conveyed by the actors as they sing their parts.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun, fun, fun! There are many options to play and great things to unlock. It was recommended to me and I plan on recommending it to someone else.
B008220C56|5.0|This is really a Valentine's gift for my beloved bride of 32 years.  She has been a fan of Anna Karenina, Tolstoy, and Kiera Knightly for a very long time and for them to come together as one project...well, we were fated to see this production in the theater and I suspect that had my wife found a way to be at the premier, not matter the expense, it would have happened.  There was a lot of attention drawn to the staging and I thought it was brilliant and pretty soon was invisible - this story is character driven, especially as portrayed by the ensemble of actors.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|It crashed my Kindle three times. It froze a lot. I deleted it once but decided to give it a second chance. It ended up crashing my Kindle again when I was not even using it. I deleted it again and so far my Kindle is working perfectly fine. I do not recommend.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Whoever chose the preview clips for this movie should be shot.  Much better than the previews suggest.  A pleasant surprise.  It's a fun movie with good music, good dancing and lots of funny lines.  If you like Glee, The Voice, etc., you'll enjoy it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I wanted to download you tube videos and watch them later without needing the internet and it did just that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game  I suggest you get this game it is it is way better than the first one
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Great book really conects to the teenagers mind. Very funny and on topic. I love how certain days are different in importance.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book was almost as good as deVinci & Demons.  The plot takes breath-holding twists, including one that almost made me stop reading it!  Set in Washington D.C. many will recognize the places that are key to the solution.  It's also full of Latin, Greek and other language phrase which lend an exotic air to the piece.  I can hardly wait for Brown's next adventure, if he hasn't used up all of his skillful research and twisting plot lines!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This made my heart melt and made me jump out of my skin at the perfect times. This is is my all-time favorite book!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Need hand weights but you could use soup cans until you can get some.  Even if you don't do the whole 30 min. workout everyday as suggested, even 10 minutes makes a huge impact if you haven't been working out regularly.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book is not a fast pace book so far, lots of words that don't say anything. I am only half-way through and am struggling at this point. Hopefully things will move a little faster in the second half!
B00B2G4ZG6|4.0|I decided to watch the premiere of \\"the Following\\" only because Kevin Bacon was in the starring role. Since \\"Footloose\\", I have loved me some Kevin Bacon!! Anyway, as I watched the bloodiness of the first episode, I decided to watch just this one hour because, really, the bloodiness was a bit much. Yet, by the time the hour was up and next week's previews came on, I knew I wouldn't be able to stop watching.<br /><br />One thing I hope the producers are careful about are who the \\"followers\\" turn out to be. A serial killer is in jail, and has a cult-like following on the outside (\\"the Followers\\") doing his bidding. It has been shocking, during the last couple of shows, to find out that someone who you thought was perfectly nice, turns out to be a murderous follower. If they employ this tactic too often and too \\"conveniently\\", it will begin to lose its power. And you'll spend the hour with your eyes darting around suspiciously, wondering who the next \\"follower\\" will be.

B005OCFGTO|1.0|The quality of the CD's was not good.  The picture was too dark and you could barely see alot of the scenes.  Did not like the wide-screen format.
B007H1HQW0|3.0|I have only had this for a week but I am not sure I'm keeping it.  It is not easy to use.  Just putting it together took 2 days and 3 different people reading the directions.  The first bottle I cut, was pretty good and I was thinking this was going to be fun!  Not so.  The other 3 I have tried since, have not cut well at all.  Jagged glass at the score line on a couple and the bottom came out of one for some reason.  I will keep trying until I run out of saved bottles, but I don't think it's going to work well.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|After all the hype and reading the first book , I had greater expectations.  One sex scene repeated over and over again and little or no plot..  Am going to read the third book but I see a trend here.  This was really only one book stretched into 3.  Hope she made a  bundle.
0071762345|5.0|It's a great book you never will be disappointed<br /><br />Buy it if you wanna learn sth about the social media!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I cant enter the game every time I try to get in it crashes I'm the first in the world and now I'm really mad!
B003UESJHO|5.0|The Fighter starring Mark Wahlberg is one of those films I thought it would be overhyped, boy was I ever wrong! The Fighter is based on a true story of boxer Mickey Ward. Not only is Wahlberg fantastic in this movie but so is Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and the brilliant Amy Adams. This film has a lot of heart and I always root for the underdog, this is a must-see film...enjoy!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kids 7 &amp; 4 enjoy this game.  It does have a glitch on the Nexus 7 when trying to visit friends.  It states not connected to the internet although I am.
B0076DELIG|5.0|&#34; the black box&#34; is excellent. I would and have recommended it to many people. Harry Bosch novels, and I've read most of them, are all very good.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|First the only free part are the first few levels then I had to pay $4.99 to continue the game. Of course I paid because I was already enjoying the game. Good graphics and story line. Only complaint is that I finished the game in a few hours so didn't feel the fee was worth it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far my favorite Nicholas Sparks book.  I love the way I grew to love the characters. Although I had already figured out the twist at the end, I was glad to be right.
B000JVSUS4|3.0|Its been a while since I viewed this film but I have to write something so I hope this qualifies.

B000WAEK0E|4.0|A phenomenal talent and dedicated musician.  You can't go wrong.  Almost all of the 'classics' are on the first disc, and the music on the remainder of the album is just as good as the rest.
0385535147|5.0|Could not put this book down. What a twister and turner this one is - very cleaver.<br />Gave it to my husband and he inhaled it too!
B009MF56GC|5.0|great movie, love the blu-ray format, will defintely purchase more blu- ray in the future, outstanding value, thanks very much.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Great animation makes older stuff look bad. But this scares my 4 year old girl. In the post Newtown age we need movies where people are not killing each other. By the way Cars 2 is crazy violent.
B000FC130E|3.0|Vivid imagery.  However continuity difficulties at times due to frequent shifting scenes and times with multiple characters  enjoyed hero and adventures
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I really, really like the case I got for my Kindle fire.  It protects my kindle, it's easy to open, not cumbersome.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Was really loving this book but the ending spoilt it for me. So disappointed on the ending. Such a shame.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have to say, I was a bit skeptical when my girlfriend told me about the show, that all changed after the first episode.  This is a fantastic written, terrifically acted saga of an English family. I would recommend this to anyone who like a good plot, suspense and fantastic storyline.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|These sisters offer refreshing lyrics, harmony, instrumentation and vocals. Be bold. Buy their music. Your ears and mind will thank you.
1451627297|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  The size is so large it is tough to read in bed but worth the hassle!!
B0000T6JGU|5.0|The bare-bones, pre-Spectorized mix of &#34;Let It Be&#34; really comes alive in this vinyl edition -- it feels warmer and fuller than the mix on CD.  It's probably as close as we can get to the simple, back-to-their-roots album The Beatles originally conceived.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I had fun playing this game!<br />It was like being in the game, it was enternaining and sometimes spooky!<br />Hated it when the pule was completed...waiting for the sequel-
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|At the height of the Golden Era of movies, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilind were the perfect couple on screen.  They made you feel the joy, hope and desperate times for England.  Hope, love, romance.  What more could you ask.  It is a few minutes to suspend your disbelief and the movie will last in your memory for a lifetime.  With the thousands of remakes of this great &#34;fairytale&#34;, this one remains my favorite.  Basil Rathbone is the perfect villain in Sir Guy and the sword work was jerky, but, hey filming was not a perfect science at that time.  It was the triumph over tragedy and good over the evil, Prince John.  History may not write these men as they are in this move, but, just watching Claude Rains as the Evil Prince John, makes it all worth while.  They are the great actors whom Derek Jacobi and Sir Laurence were to be and they learned from the best.  Love, Hope, Joy and the triumph over evil, with a ton of laughter in each line.  Enjoy!
B0060AY85C|5.0|A beautiful, heartwarming novel. I am a huge fan of all of her books. I just wish it would have been longer. Great read.

B00AWFEBDK|3.0|Very slow paced.  Not in the same level as the author's best book, particularly Collapse and Guns, Germs and Steel)
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We had a marathon and watched all the movies in a row!  Nice to have just the movies, since some of the fancier sets cost a fortune, and what I really wanted was just the movies!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Having just devoured book two, I make a promise to join the real world for a while before starting book three. This book takes you on a journey that requires decompression by the end.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|When I was younger I really loved this franchise. I watched the first two films many many times. As I got older I fell away from them. When the trailer for Fast 5 came out I was very intrigued at how fun it looked. My friend and I decided to marathon the previous 4 before going to the theater. It was not like i remembered. The first one was alright but the rest were pretty awful imo. Fast and Furious (4th film) was incredibly bad and since it was the same director working on Fast 5 our expectations dropped. We almost decided not to go. But the film started to get positive buzz so we decided to go. One of the best decisions I have ever made. I was blown and extremely shocked by how FUN this movie is! The action is so thrilling and feels so real due to practical effects and stunts. One of the rare films these days to provide an old school type of action film with actors younger than 60. Shootouts, car chases, and hand to hand brawls that will leave you breathless. Highly Highly recommended.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Bought this for Thrift Shop, not a single song on here I don't enjoy. Very hardcore but with a positive slant on things. I support any artist who has the courage to stand up for their beliefs and try to be a role model.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Not the best book of the trilogy, and the ending is pretty predictable. I would still recommend reading this book if you have already read the first two.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books make up an awesome trilogy, but this one is my favorite of the three! It has everything love, adventure, danger, etc.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game has worked without any glitches for over a year now. For only a dollar, I've literally spent hours and hours playing this game. Well worth the money!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I really liked this book. I got it as a daily deal on Christmas and it was well worth the $1.99. The first few hundred pages are very slow, but the detail goes a long way to make the ending very interesting. I enjoyed how it was very character driven and the choices they made were very consistent with the information given about their personalities.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game rocks.I love it.super cool.I recommend you get it.if you don't you will be sorry.but I have it and it is super cool
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the first book of the trilogy. Nice to see that the movie followed the book fairly close.  Nice to be able to connect some of the important pieces ,not seen in the movie , that were important pieces of the back story.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I got it for free and I loved it until it crashed so I uninstalled and then tried to re install it but it said that I still had it and I'm still trying to re install
B001CDZZI6|5.0|As a repeat to all other comments, you need to buy a new book to get an access code. The alternative though is to go here: [...] where you can buy only the test for $9.99 for your top 5 (as the code is good for) or $89.99 if you do want all 34 listed. A good alternative for waiting for another book to arrive.
B000062V9C|4.0|The movie plays well over all, however, there is a scene in the movie where a scene from a different movie plays for 15 seconds.
B006TTC54A|5.0|This is a must have for any movie collector. And now on Blu Ray you get an amazing Picture and sound quality.
B009SJ46EA|3.0|This show is interesting and I do enjoy it. The atmosphere, creepiness, and great acting from most of the actors keep me tuning in. Ths show however has some annoying flaws that reduce what could easily be a better quality show. Chief of these is its tendency to have too many storylines. Many story lines that are interesting that I want to see more development in are curtailed to 2 dimensional snippets of an idea...more three dimensionality in the narratives are sacrificed for multiple ideas that seem more like outlines of a story rather than a developed idea.* This is very annoying*  The show clearly could benefit from the artistic concept of *editing* and *less is more philosophy*. Also some of the outrageouness of some storylines are overdone and seem downright cartoonish...which is a frustrating contrast to the gothic atmospheric aspect of the setting. The sadistic content is overly used and becomes very predictable. I feel a sense of inconsistency as the positive aspects of the show can be undermined but the negative. Finally, for those of you familiar with the concept of \\"gestalt\\" (the sense of an ordered whole).....overall there is too often a sense of a bad gestalt...too many disparate parts. Season one had a much better gestalt and sense of an integrated whole. Even though that season had many mini storylines it was integrated into a cohesive story and I felt that season one had a better quality of development with the storylines and characters.  I'm a little worried about what Season 3 may bring. I'm afraid the series my deterirate into a smorgasboard type narratives where it's like you eat at a smorgasboard and taste so many different kinds of food that you miss the depth and flavour and sophistication of a well balanced meal that works together.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very disappointed in the book.  Undoubtedly, J.K. Rowling is a very talented writer who does an excellent job of character development.  I just did not like the characters she developed.<br /><br />V Holmes

0425252868|5.0|I purchased this book for both of my grandfathers, ages 80 and 90.  Both of them managed to sneak away from the family fun on Christmas to start reading and could not put the book down! An expertly written story of true combat.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought this Lego set for my 9 year old granddaughter for Christmas. After I received it, I was so happy that Lego had finally made some cute and challenging sets for girls.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|So maybe Kevin Smith's dream of seeing Clint Eastwood play Batman in a live action of this comic come true, but this is pretty darn awesome.  Can't wait to see Part 2, which is on it's way to my house right now!
B00746TURW|5.0|This is a wonderful novel. It is beautifully written, with memorable characters and skilfully structured and crafted.<br />The beginning is stunning as is the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This kindle version is epic than the IOS version. Thanks for making the app it's to epic to give 4,3,2,1 stars it deserves a 5star rating.
B005LAIHTA|4.0|I'm not so sure you should classify this as a chick flick, even though there seemed to be a lot more females than males at the screening I attended. For me there were enough non-romance scenes to make it a more of a mystery. I can't say a lot about the plot without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it.<br /><br />The movie runs the course of your basic romance with an unlikely couple who meet and fall for each other in spite of their problems until their relationship takes a major hit due to revelations about a secret past. In fact, threaded throughout the story are short scenes involving a Boston cop obsessed with finding a suspect in an attempted murder. There are a few tense moments of violence and absolute terror, but it's not gratuitous or over done, only enough to reveal the mystery and lead to a satisfying conclusion, (or not). What I liked the most was that, just when I thought the plot had taken its final twist, a letter is opened and read which surprised me all over again.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie much more than The Notebook, another movie based on a novel by the same author, Nicholas Sparks. I felt this was more action packed, exciting and optimistic that The Notebook. I also felt the cast was strong, from the leading characters to the supporting actors. All in all, an entertaining movie that I would recommend.

0307740919|5.0|Toni Morrison never disappoints!!! I borrowed this book from the library and on my dresser it sat for two weeks because I was reading something else. After paying library fines for it, once I opened it, I couldn't put it down and dinner nor laundry got done for two days. I love a book that I can get lost in and her creativity takes me away like Calgon every time! This is proof that the right words don't have to be that many in order to get your point across! Classic and timeless!

B008MG1E4A|3.0|ANOTHER ANGLE ON HOW WE GOT BIN LADEN.GOOD READING BUT THIS READER HAD ALREADY READ TWO OTHER BOOKS BY THE PARTICIPANTS SO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is a highly engaging (some would say addictive) historical drama about a wealthy family in England.<br /><br />Since the first season set up the characters and cast out several plot lines, season two continues with an important plot element: the effects of The Great War (WWI) on the family, the town, the country.  Relationships between the characters continue to evolve, and begin to change here and there.  We see kindness, and ruthlessness, as they all interact.<br /><br />The intelligent story line has many twists and turns, and often ends with some kind of major event. There is more going on in a few episodes than an entire season of some TV shows; indeed, the end of an episode<br />often includes a cliff-hanger that made us think we were seeing the season finale.<br /><br />Casting and acting is superb. Even the minor characters are interesting and believable.<br /><br />We watched season one on blu-ray, and season two on conventional DVD. The blu-ray version was a bit jumpy, due to the shows many pan and scan shots, though this could be that I don't have a new enough HDTV to keep up with the data rate. Certainly, the picture quality was not so much better than DVD that it was worth the jerkiness.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I want to give this game app a 5 star rating because it is really fun.  But the one big flaw is the in game purchases.  I'm not the kind to just spend money on game apps just because, but if I really like the game and it will make it more fun or just a little easier I don't mind spending a few dollars here and there, especially for this game.  There is so much of the map to open up and so many ways to customize and add things to make your PonyVille the way you want it, and so many different ponies to purchase, the problem is it takes so much money and gems to get these things and getting money doesn't really get easier as you go, especially since things cost more as you go.  I would love to purchase some extra coins and gems, but they are just way too expensive to be worth buying.  Yes you can purchase just $5 worth, but you get so little for that money that you would barely be able to do one thing, and the bigger ones for $50-$100 is far too much to be spending on a game.  I downloaded a farming game for my phone and you can purchase extra money and bigger tractors for just a couple dollars at a time, but before I knew it I'd spent $20, and then another $12 on more upgraded equipment a week later.  At the prices now I won't be making any purchases in this MLP game, but if the costs were dramatically reduced, I'm sure that others as well as myself will spend money to get extra stuff in game.  It's the difference between selling a couple things to just a few rich people, or selling a lot of stuff to many average people, you'll make way more money that way.  So please please please fix this flaw, I would start making purchases immediately, you made a great game and deserve to make money for it, but it has to be affordable.  And I will do a follow up review if there are any changes made.  Thank you!

B009439HEY|5.0|I won't go into more detail than has been provided in the many positive reviews.  I find this an exciting, and timely, production.  I've seen Hackett's interviews (web site and YouTube) and he shows so much passion for this work.  It's interesting it's release follows his divorce and remarriage.  I think he's rekindled his youth with the wisdom and compassion of maturity.  We certainly benefit.  I wish his tour were coming to the Bay Area.  Sigh.  There's nothing like Steve Hacket liquid guitar.  I actually like some of these arrangements better than the originals.  Maybe its the 21st treatment.  Hackett also shared some of the originals were rushed between touring, so this is his labor of love and ode to perfection.  Great man.  I'm grateful to him for his efforts and generosity of spirit.

0307730697|5.0|Some people believe that heroes are born.<br />Others believe that heroes are made.<br />A few believe that certain individuals are destined to become heroes.<br /><br />What do you believe?<br /><br />After reading the story of Adam Brown - an American patriot and Navy SEAL who overcame incredible odds to serve his country and, ultimately, sacrificed his life in service to a cause he believed in and a country he loved - I cannot help but think there is a bit of truth in each of those theories.<br /><br />Fearless by Eric Blehm is the true story of an undersized daredevil from Arkansas whose greatest dream as a young boy was to play football like his big brother Shawn. In high school, Adam prospered as the proverbial big fish in a small pond. When Adam entered college, however, he found himself in an environment where he no longer excelled. Unable to handle the transition, he began a downward spiral and soon fell in with the wrong crowd.<br /><br />One bad decision led to another. Before long, Adam was spiraling down a path where death and destruction seemed like a more likely outcome than a future full of commendations and medals. But, fortunately, the story does not end there.<br /><br />God had a plan for Adam's life, and these pit stops were nothing that God could not redeem.<br /><br />In Fearless, Eric Blehm masterfully recounts how Adam overcomes a dark past of homelessness, jail and addiction to crack cocaine as well as disabling on-the-job injuries to rise to the ranks of the military's elite. In spite of the adversities Adam faces along the way - or perhaps because of them - Adam ultimately rises to the top tier of the military and serves as a member of the elite Navy SEAL Team SIX - the counter-terrorism unit that becomes famous for taking down Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />What makes Fearless such a great story, however, is that Eric doesn't focus solely on Adam's military feats or his role as a warrior. He focuses on his faith and his humanity. Fearless tells the story of a loving son, husband and father who lived life to the fullest and who gave that life for the people and country he loved.<br /><br />I'd like to share this journal entry that he wrote to his young children in case the worst was to happen to him:<br /><br />I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this Earth because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me... How much it pains me... to think about not watching my boy excel in life, or giving my little baby girl away in marriage... Buddy I'll be there, you'll feel me there when you steal your first base, smash someone on the football field, make all A's. I'll be there for all of your achievements. But much more, Buddy, I'll be there for every failure. Remember, I know tears, I know pain and disappointment, and I will be there for you with every drop. You cannot disappoint me. I understand!<br /><br />From the moment I picked up Fearless, I was hooked as I read about a man who was as reckless as he was courageous, as flawed as he was heroic. I not only appreciated his story and his sacrifice, but the stories and the sacrifices of his family, friends, and fellow SEALS as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a copy of this book from the Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for review purposes.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|Wonderful characters, although there are too many to keep straight at times, and great twists to plots.  Would still be a great book if it were about 2/3 as long.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Spiritual, masterfully and beautifully written book. Makes your imagine come alive! Worth a read for sure. Movie is also wonderful
B0076UXKDG|1.0|I bought this together with the Meike after market grip for 15% of the price.  I returned the Nikon.  The Meike has better bracing and there is no difference in function.  Neither fit perfectly smoothly, both are solid, both appear to use identical switchgear.<br /><br />You can get a digital SLR from Nikon for about the same price as this grip.  There is simply no justification for it.
1452105111|5.0|My son's first birthday party is Very Hungry Caterpillar themed. I was able to spell out 'happy birthday Ryland' with a caterpillar in between the first two words and a butterfly between birthday and Ryland. Perfect!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this wonderful film from Tim Burton.  I believe this is probably one of Burton's best films because I can see the love he has for film history and classic horror films.  He also reveals his heart by making the connection between a boy and his dog a central theme.  This tale of a boy genius who is inspired by his science teacher and his own intelligence to revive his beloved dog is made endearing because of the many touching moments between he and his dog, Sparky.  He does this out of love without worrying about the possible consequences.  The consequences take the form of the jealousy that exists among his classmates, the closed mind attitude of some adults, scientific experimentation, and ultimately a lack of compassion.  This is a marvelous film with many touching moments and winks to films like, Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, Gamera, Dracula, Gremlins, Young Frankenstein, Lifeforce, The Creature from the Black lagoon, and numerous mad scientist, zombie and alien movies.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Epic fail! The book had a few decent moments and I actually got excited about the big twist...and then pure failure came with the ending. Such a disappointment. Drags readers through a tale of misery just to leave them angry that they wasted the time wading through the disaster. Just sad.
B005LAII62|4.0|Paranorman is NOT a small children's movie.  I would not take anyone under 12 to this movie.  There are some scary moments about a young boy who sees the dead and can communicate with them.  There are some colorful characters in this roller coaster ride of a movie.  In the end, it is more of a psychological horror film than a spoof.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A some great book best 1 just buy it people you will love it trust me I'm not a big fat lair
0425263916|5.0|I'm enjoying this a bit better than 50 Shades.  It's hot & steamy without domination...at least so far. Looking forward to June 2013.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It does exactly what I need it to do.  There are no frills, but it works just as it is supposed to.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game and totally worth the seven bucks. It is a sandbox game where you can create whatever you want in creative mode. In survival mode you can light tnt, make a nether reactor, fight evil mobs like zombies, creepers, skeletons, and spiders. You can also craft armor in the new update, make a stonecutter, craft signs and enter text on them, and you can breed animals. You can go mining for coal, iron, gold, and diamonds. This game is definantly worth buying.
1616550414|5.0|With never before seen, stunning artwork, the official timeline, and an all new manga based on Skyward Sword, this great book cannot be missed! Any Zelda, Nintendo, or general adventure fan should not be without Hyrule Historia.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I've been battling restlessness and constantly waking up numerous times at night. A friend suggested that I try a sound machine, but those can run on the expensive side and I'm saving up currently, so I stumbled upon this app. Purely by choice of the lovely visual. Turns out to be a wonderful penny saving app. The first night I used it I. Slept a lot more sound and only woke up once during the night. It also wasn't hard to fall back asleep. Would definitely give this a try if you have trouble sleeping, need to unwind before bed, just want to space out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game so much fun with loads of things to do really addictive and can go a bit fuzzy at times other than that fantastic I would recommend it to everyone
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Love this cover.  Keeps my Kindle safe and makes it easy to carry around with me.<br />Chose the color purple because it was bright and easy to find.  Good buy.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|NICHOLAS SPARKS IS A WONDERFUL WRITER AND WHEN YOU START READING ANY OF HIS BOOKS YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM DOWN UNTIL YOUR ARE FINISHED WITH THE ENTIRE BOOK.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Although I only saw the reviews and haven't sat down long enough to watch a full episode yet, but with Kevin Bacon starring in it, it has to be good and the fact that it's a psychological thriller?  Even better!
B0024FAR5W|5.0|blu ray dvd is the best experience for any show or movie I purchased every sons of anarchy season on blu ray I couldn't be happier
B0094BB4TW|5.0|For a free download, this works very well.  I am so glad that I can get onto facebook easily on my Kindle Fire.  Thank you
B00683JK9K|5.0|I almost didn't download because of all the reviews...however...I know what they were talking about but is because of skipping a step..when you are selecting your puzzle before clicking start..click on the button \\"rotating\\" or the pieces will already be rotated in the right direction for you..and if you are showing missing pieces unlock the puzzle piece symbol in the right corner because that shows you only your outside edge pieces.... Good free app of the day...Very even has beginner's..advanced..etc. options for a harder puzzle. Keep up the good work guys.<br /><br />ALSO if you find a few pieces missing at the end its like life puzzles they have gotten under the puzzle lol.. but to get them back apparently all u gotta go is click the puzzle piece symbol on and off and it puts them back in the column for u... At least that's what I did and it worked just fine :)
6305428050|5.0|good entertaining comedy kinda like porky's or such, it is rather<br />juvenile but a lot of laughs, good for ther younger set.
B008C40218|4.0|Another enjoyable album from this Tucson-based Indie group. I hope to see them live again in the future(saw them in past in Chicago)
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|My new favourite band is Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. Just got this album and have also been listening to their other album \\"Here\\". Both albums are packed with great songs.<br /><br />I usually buy an album because it has 2 or 3 great songs that I like. Got this album for Christmas (1 month ago as of this writing) and so far it has 7 songs that I love - 40 Day Dream, Janglin, Carries On, Jade, Home, Black Water, and Om Nashi Me.<br /><br />I love their music style, but what really makes this album great is the variety of the songs. So many groups write good songs but then you buy their album and all the songs sound similar. NOT so with Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and for me that's what makes them so enjoyable to listen to.
B003VFEROQ|3.0|I have a couple of other Bowie tributes and am impressed by some of the songs that were covered on this one that weren't the 'usual suspects'.
B009329Y30|3.0|im not going to say I wasn't engaged with this movie, but I feel like ive seen it all before. also, the actors chemistry was barely there. I kinda felt like she would have been better suited to play his mom.
1568363931|5.0|I purchased this because it really had some good recipes, and tips. excellent book and best bento book I have come across so far.
1451695195|3.0|Nice story he told, but the idea that we all need &#34;proof&#34; of God completely contradicts the whole basis of Christianity. Also, the author probably writes as well as a high-schooler. The story was interesting though, give it a shot... Remember, God loves you for who you are- not because you read a book that PROVED he existed. :-)
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The DVD is a great value-  solid content with great graphics!  No cost cutting here.  I recommend it highly if the subject is in your interests.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I know that it's sad that I'm almost 23 and I'm still watching teen vamp shows, but I can't help myself - this show is just too juicy! Not to mention, uhhh, Mr. Somerhalder! The action and plots just seem to get better with each season... However, at the end of the day - any redeeming value? Probably not. But a wonderful way to waste time!
B000S88JTS|5.0|If you like the sport, you will love this historical piece.  I watched it online somewhere and had to have it.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This movie is amazing (Understatement) this is going to always be a person's all time favorite. I can watch it over and over again
B008011XQQ|5.0|I was very pleased with the download and purchase of Shape Shifter and got it at a good price. Thanks!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love the puzzles in this game.  I also love that you can add more games for free.<br />  I highly recommend this app.
0545128285|5.0|It's small, but if you are a Harry Potter fan, go for it.<br />If you are NOT a Harry Potter fan, don't buy it as you will be disappointed.
B004LROUNG|5.0|i think people will like this book because it also was will written i starts out goood and ends even better.
B00002DEBW|5.0|\\"This is about as rich of a jazz fusion album as you can get. Like Weather Report's Mysterious Traveller, Romantic Warrior revolves around a particular theme or mood which in this case is medieval knights. The sounds are spectacular and well-done for the most part with a quirky and rhythmically intriguing use of video-game like synthesizers, basslines, and guitar work. The mood of the album is appropriately fitting to where its sound can be said as being complimentary to a classic Nintendo game (the Zelda games, perhaps?) or even a Sim City game (composer Jerry Martin has a very similar sound of music in the soundtracks too). Sorceress, so far, along with the opening track Medieval Overture, both reel you into the music's elaborate and vivid universe that can only be describe on a morning get-to-work kind of drive. The album is best listened twice than once in order to get a better grip of its philosophy and vibes even if the essence of jazz, especially the experimental kind, is not necessarily aimed at proving a point but to accentuate a rhythm that is not otherwise found in more conventional music.\\"
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Many people were saying that the keymapping program is a pain, yes it is, but its much better than older keymapping programs that Logitech has put out. On that note the G13 has this incredible button called MR your playing the game have that key that you didn't or forgot to map you press MR push your Gkey and map it to the keyboard in game I setup all my controls for X3 reunion in game with the MR key (if you've played X3 you know how many buttons I'm talking about) anyway it takes just a few minuets to set up and so far the best game pad I've bought. The LCD screen I haven't played with it much, but it is nice to have a clock so you know how many hours of your life you just wasted without having to shutdown the game. The little joy stick is great except for the push down button its a little hard to activate, but with a little practice its easy. The color scheming is outstanding any color you want, you can change it for all three modes so you know at a glance what mode your in. The apps are cool I disabled some, I'm not sure as of yet where a good site is for downloading apps. This is absolutely awesome after about 12 hours of playing with it I would recommend it to anyone playing RTS, MMO, RPG, FPS in 2D or 3D in and out of vehicles, great for planes and helicopters. So far it's worked great with X3: reunion, C&C3 KW and TW , Arma II, TES IV Oblivion, TES V Skyrim, Borderlands, I also mapped it so I could use it as a one handed keyboard for typing. If your an indecisive gamer like me who changes games frequently or plays two at the same time this game pad automatically changes game profiles depending on what screen is up, entirely awesome. If my view point on this product changes I'll post an update.<br /><br />Adam--
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|It starts out slow and your not sure where their going with it until about half way through. But, when it gets going it takes off and starts blowing your mind and you will be asking your the whole movie wtf is going on!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Definitely worth the effort to download!  I would highly recommend this to my friends and family.  One of the best in free apps you can get on the store.
B008C20TDG|5.0|My daughter read this book and told<br />me I had to get it. She was excited about finding a natural way to<br />finally heal herself. The book explains the how's and why's we suffer from<br />disorders and diseases, in layman's terms. You will<br />finally understand how certain foods cause different health problems and how they can make you healthy or sick. This book will give you the knowledge to get you back to \\"Healthy\\" again, if you're willing to put forth the effort. My family and myself are excited and ready to do \\"THE WHOLE 30 CHALLENGE\\"<br />We're looking foward to seeing some health improvements.<br />I may come back in 30 days with our results.<br />I'm pretty certain the most obvious improvement will be weight loss and more energy. We'll see.
B000005AYL|1.0|When I bought this record I expected to receive it with the original album cover.  Instead I got a black sleeve with sticker with the track listing.  When I buy a record but of the enjoyment is the album art.  This was very disappointing...
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|If you enjoy playing Backgammon, I recommend downloading this one, it can keep you entertained for hours on end.  I particularly like being able to choose the difficulty levels.  I don't really understand the &#34;doubling&#34; option that pops up from time to time, but you can turn that part off and not be bothered with it.  The computer is a good opponent even though some of its' moves don't always seem logical, it does give you a run for your money so to speak, and it plays fair.  The only improvement I would make on this game is to also offer the option of playing Acey-Duecy, but for the time-being I'm content with Backgammon.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|The game was fun! but I was really disapointed because during the game it just kept restarting!!!  why? I don't know.

B003RV43X4|4.0|The product was great -but the movie was not as good as I remembered. Thanks for the speedy return.Great! Will do business again
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love this book. It is long, but it goes relatively quickly if you can devote some time to it. I knew next to nothing about this time period, or even of JFK's assassination besides the basic facts so reading this was an education for me as well. King keeps it interesting, adds the history in when it's necessary and you need to know the context, but creates a lovely story within as well. I could see the ending going so many different ways, but ultimately it had to be the way he wrote it. A happy ending to some, and maybe not to others.
1400097029|5.0|John Banville, The Sea<br /><br />The Daily Telegraph found Banville's 2005 Booker-winning novel his best so far.  This may well be the case, for I had to abandon his Doctor Copernicus when Nicolas and his clownish brother felt obliged to quit Bologna to see the Pope's celebrations, where `the Lord of Darkness himself had come forth to be acclaimed by the delirious mob.' This was in the jubilee year of 1500.  But then, I have always had trouble with historical novels - the dates, the whole battery of important names to keep in mind, the constant need to adjust to two timescales.  Maybe it's just my problem, as they say, or lately I've just had too much Hilary Mantel.  I never quite manage to lose myself, never manage to stop myself from asking why bother with all this fustian. I prefer history undiluted.<br /><br />So The Sea was a welcome relief and a book well worth re-reading.  Indeed, I knew I'd been impressed five years ago on first reading, but that apart couldn't remember much about the novel.  But this time I found Max Morden's nostalgic exploration of his past brought on by a recent bereavement even more seductive and haunting.  I believed his every word and needed to accompany him on this necessary journey into the interior to assuage his present grief.  As with all good novels it is the understated and not stated that intrigues, the seemingly irrelevant diversions that add ultimately the touch of conviction.  Thus Max recalls his boyhood curiosity about birds' eggs, his `simple passion to know something of the secrets of the other, alien lives.'  One day he visits the nest to find it robbed, one egg smashed: `All that remained of it was a smear of mingled yoke and glair and a few fragments of shell, each with its stippling of tiny, dark-brown spots.' The narrator takes time to speculate on the gorse and `the buttery perfume of its blossoms,' before returning to `those brown speckles' of the egg, `the emblem of something final, precious and irretrievable.' All of which would be fine and consoling were it not for the final shock of his wife `leaning sideways from the hospital bed, vomiting on the floor, her burning brow pressed into my palm, full and frail as an ostrich egg.' By this time both Max and the reader have forgotten all about his bereavement.  The sudden shock of recognition is poignantly true to life.<br /><br />Similar hints that tease the reader into Max's world are provided throughout.  The book bristles with unanswered questions.  Why is Max still obsessed by the Grace family, all now passed into the land of lost desires, in love with the mother rather than his coevals, Chloe and Myles?  What is the significance of his devotion to the work of Bonnard, about whom he is struggling to write?  And what about Cedars, the old house, lingered over, pondered on, still standing and still run by the same enigmatic Miss Vavasour, whose mission now seems to be dedicating herself to the Colonel, who may well be an imposter anyway?  What happened to Chloe in the end, a sparklingly independent lass who has some affinities with Dickens's proud Estella? Max's revelations are slow and stumbling, as he moves between the crowded past and the empty present. And behind it all is the ever-present allure of the sea.<br /><br />This is a fine novel, a worthy award-winner, one that stands head and shoulders above so many other flavour of the season best-sellers.  As The Times reviewer believes `it will still be read and admired in seventy-five years.'  Or longer, much longer.All of which would be fine and consoling were it not for the final shock of his wife `leaning sideways from the hospital bed, vomiting on the floor, her burning brow pressed into my palm, full and frail as an ostrich egg.'

I have my 72 Fender which i care for deeply, but never 'clean' only thing i change on it is strings and the battery for the pick-up.. you come near my s*** with fret board cleaner or say i'm going to 're-wire' it.. I'd expect a new dent in my bass from your head :)

B005CRQ3H0|5.0|In many ways Inherent Vice appears to be something akin to a classic 1950's gumshoe noir such as LA Confidential.  But if you keep believing that you'll be sorely disappointed. It may share a lot of similar themes, but this late 60's/1970 era private detective story is more about the foggy journey of life, and not understanding what's going on, and the idea that maybe you never will. It's a bizarre journey down an old L.A. with observations on the death of the hippie movement, criminal activity, and more.  And if you can enjoy something for the bizarre journey of it all, rather than some ultimate conclusion, then it can be a very fun read. Pynchon's penchant for describing a time and place as both mundane grounded reality and bizarre otherworld is as present as ever, but this time in a more fun, easygoing, era and location appropriate way.

B00AYB1RGG|1.0|If you are a fan of stalones version of judge dredd do not rent this... the movie has no real feel of the future other than the fact they tell you it is.... the whole movie is based in a tower and has no feel of the origional.... if you have never seen dredd get the stalone version first... and disreguard this version... waste of 5 dollar hd rental.....
B005JR47R6|5.0|I am so sad that House is over. I will be watching each season again. When the series was over, I felt I had lost a friend a friend or two. How pathetic is that? Just goes to show you how real the characters were portrayed.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I would recommend this to all busy professionals who need an easy to read and use calendar accessible by cell phone wherever you go!  It works well with google calendar and has not missed a calendared event yet!  You can set it to sync with your google calendar every few minutes if necessary, and it actually works--as opposed to some other calendars.  I tried another free calendar program as well as the one that came with my android phone, and both missed important calendared events.  The free program was difficult to read.  CalenGood is easy to ready your events each day.  The only problem I have with it is when you have more than one event scheduled at the same time (say for example court settings for more than one person), it can be difficult to read that way.  But you can work around that.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show draws you into its characters and you can't stop watching.  A magnificent cast of characters with a great story line.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the game but haven't had much time to really play it and get good scores.<br />I know that I will enjoy it more once I  really get playing it.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I have always loved this movie and wanted to buy the DVD for our family!  In great condition and picture quality is great!
B009O2XY12|3.0|I like the game and it is fun to play. I just haven't had time to play it very much.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I enjoy using this app while I read. A husband and four kids makes for a very noisy house this app helps me escape and get some reading done. I like Amazon and crashing waves the best. I also love the rocking ship.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It works. Not much more can be said for a cable that I needed because I lost the original during my move.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Continuing on from A Game of Thrones, the book brings familiar characters in new directions; constantly surprising and intriguing. Also new plot lines are dragged into the mix. George RR Martin is great at making strange people and worlds come alive. A habit of repeating himself, but this makes it really easy to follow intermingling plots.
0761163808|5.0|It's a great concept and my little guy loves looking at the animals in motion!! Definitely would for young or older kids!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great time filler for boring times and it's is addictive it's so fun I love this app I love the art
0307165485|5.0|I had this book when I was young. I loved to just look at the pictures. I wanted to get this for my young sons. They seem to get as much enjoyment as I did! Richard Scarry books are wonderful! Some of the pictures are a little outdated (the television looks more like a microwave then today's flat screens) but that's to be expected from a classic. The book has great pages for learning colors, shapes, letters, numbers, etc.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wayy better than temple run.reallyfun and the graphics are good nice n hd on the kindle also great for ipod or andriod
1907590331|4.0|Never have a seen a book of friendship, companionship, love, turmoil, and heartbreak so brilliantly played out as in this incredible Steinbeck gem.  These two young, brave men meander the sandy roads of California, escaping the peak of the dust bowl and searching for a job to pay for the trek from town to town.  If something permanent, or even longer than a three day stint seems like a gift from the creator that Must be followed through.  However, the massive and slightly askewed Lenny brings what seems to be a promising position to a terminal life sentence.  Lenny vividly captures 13 year olds and strategically roofies the poor symbols of innocence until unconscious sex is the only option.  Then, Lenny uses these absent bodies to suicide bomb the largest areas of tourism in Northern California.  The highways, traffic jams, public beaches, and Chinatowns soon become victims of terrible attack.  Lastly, in closing the story, Lenny orders and attack on a large naval base of the coast of Hawaii, Pearl Harbor.  The final paragraphs paint a delicate scene of two best friends, madly in love, inter coursing and Lenny tragically dying of myocardial infarction, a heart fart, aka heart attack.. Good read, slow moving at times
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Very entertaining throughout andalso informative and remindful of past history.Feel it very advisable to read Fall of Giants first.Looking forward to next book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a must read for anyone!  He is an example for everyone , especially fathers and husbands, to look to as a role model.  For any Christians that read this, take notes.  If you're not a Christian, find faith.
B0073RBQY2|5.0|We have over a hundred Schleich toys and this one is just as good as the rest. Very well made and lots of fun to play with.
B008AT71WI|5.0|We've all seen Little Shop of Horrors (and sang along with it), but now you can listen to director's commentary on all the scenes, and the alternate ending (never released, and because it tested so poorly [Twice!] it's not even edited or scored. But very cool to see!
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Good read.  The ending left something to be desired though but it was a good quick read that held my attention throughout.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Really good read, and the examples of outliers were well supported, but seems to give too much credence to the notion that success is mostly a matter of luck and circumstance.  Recognizing the stream of opportunities that presented themselves to these very successful people, they still had to actually take advantage of them with hard work and all the rest. I wonder how many stories could be compiled of unsuccessful people that let extraordinary opportunities slip by.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I am unable after many tries to find this app on my Nexus 10 or on my Gallaxy III,  Either I need help or this app does.  Amazon, p[lease help me.
B005723JSQ|4.0|It was cute!  A good beach book.  I would recommend this to anyone who has some down time, I think it only took me 2 hours to read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love it but I hate it. It's pretty fine though I'm having tons and tons of fun with it its really good.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|we were so excited to get the video we watched all in one sitting and came away both sad and with somewhat disappointment in some of the definite gaps. it was even more clear when we tuned into PBS on sunday the following weekends and rewatched the first and continuing episodes week after week, it was almost like it was two different versions of Downton Abbey season 3. i feel like we havent got the right version that we paid for . this one was a &#34;carnival &#34;  product would that have been the difference ?  we would like to send it back , is that possible ?
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is great. i love all of the Angry birds. I love the bright colors and all in the one.
