B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the most addictive game ever. I cant put it down. They need to come up with a C.A. group (crush anonymous).
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Please don't ever change this game  . This is the most incredible game ever created. Whoever created this game aid a genius. I wish that I was this smart to come up with a game that every one loves to play
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever but need more free lives.  and less time wait on challenges that's frustrating .love love this game
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I love this movie!  it is very intense and somewhat plausible.  Love the progression of the storyline, though unlikely that even Brad would have survived!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Just got the new kindle fire HD and I love this new app. Looking forward to trying out all the effects.
B009CVRQLY|4.0|While there are no My Heart Will Go On's or Because You Loved Me's, there are five major standout tracks on this album of 13 songs.  In this day and age, having at least five good songs on an album is a big accomplishment.<br /><br />The most memorable tracks from this album are:<br />Breakaway<br />Unfinished Song<br />At Seventeen<br />Always Be Your Girl<br />Loved Me Back To Life - written by SIA!<br /><br />The mediocre songs on this album are the ones that sound like todays current pop tracks.  Two such examples are \\"Save your Soul\\" and \\"Somebody Loves Somebody\\" which both sound like Maroon 5 tracks.  The collaboration with Ne-Yo isn't a terrible track but not my favorite.  With that said, this track could be the big crossover radio hit that Celine hasn't had in awhile.  I think it's a crime that the title track, \\"Love Me Back To Life\\" is not getting any radio support.  It truly is one of her best single in a long long time.<br /><br />Celine Dion is one of the greatest vocalists of our lifetime so highly recommend this album just to hear that great instrument come to life on this broad collection of music styles.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Oh who am I kidding I love this anyway. At least five great songs and the rest grow on you
B003G4W49C|4.0|Is this a junior high lit class and I will not get a grade if I do not tell you why I thought as highly of it as I graded it? Relish the praise, and bugger off!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I really like this game it's Super fun and additive I love that it's free and User friendly I totally recommend this game
0525953590|5.0|This is another great book in Theoretical Physics.<br />This one is by Sean Carroll. He is located at Cal Tech, CA.<br /><br />The book is well written. It is a down to earth explanation of this area of physics.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone interested in physics.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|This is a great game if you want to exercise your brain and to keep it clear, just don't cheat, it is easy to fall in the cheating
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally!!! I love this game it is so addicting! Kids and adults can share in the fun. Must play always!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I heard about this book on NPR and after my wife got a copy of it, I had to read it. I haven't read too many 5th grade books recently, so it was surprising to follow the tone and cadence oft his book. The author mixes in a lot of modern issues and mediums to make the characters and story come to life. Great lesson so or students and parents.
B000683VI4|5.0|Terrific movie when I first saw this movie I kinda thought this movie wasn't meat to be seen by a guy but the second time I watched it I found out it was a great movie to watch with your significant other.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|There must be something in my DNA that forces me to finish a book I've started no matter how little pleasure I get from reading it.  I slogged through to the end but found myself needing to gather strength at the end of each chapter so I could go on to the next. There is not an upbeat paragraph in this book. Every twist and turn of the plot ends tragically for someone.  There is no closure at the end, as if the author wrote the ending specifically in order to sell Book Two.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Awesome movie by far one of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time. Usually movies don't make me jump but this one did.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Phenomenal film based on the book of the same name by Jo Nesbø. Nesbø is an amazing writer so I was concerned that the movie would be a let down, not so. The film seems to stick closely to the plot of the book, no major differences that I can recall.  I highly recommend this film and the the book, as well as Jo Nesbø's books featuring Harry Hole.  Nesbø is a genius and this book adapted brilliantly to the screen.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Such a great story line, amazing character development and acting to boot.  Not happy with the last episode ending - but such is life :)  Still would recommend to ANYONE!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman is one of the best authors of fantasy stories that will bend your perception and change the way you view reality.  This is an example of an all around great story involving characters that you might define as normal.  You would wrong on that point.  There is not much that is normal at the end of the lane.  My only complaint is it is really a novelette and not long enough.  A very good read and time well spent nonetheless.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|First off, it is funny Oria's emotions control the weather. It would not be funny in real life, but this is fantasy and that is funny.  The family reunions were cute.  I think the story is interesting and you want to know what happens next. It is good to see and elderly couple who love each other, with all these bad marriage jokes going around. I'm glad the author resisted society's way of making marriage look like the worst thing to happen to anyone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the John Grisham we all love. I could not put it down once I started. It was great to pick up with all of the characters from A Time To Kill.  Keep them coming!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book kept me on my toes, but the ending brought me to tears, I mean if Veronica Roth walked up to me right I would be clawing at her screaming &#34;WHY!?&#34;.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not as good as the Shining.  But what could be?  Whatever happened to Danny Torrance as he faces his own trauma from his childhood and then becomes involved in the protection of another child like himself.  Very good sequel
0385537131|3.0|Repititous theme. Too much white versus black. Still a wonderful author who holds ones attention throught out the story. Will always look forward to another of his novels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I recommended this book series too all my friends. It's a great sci-fi story with a little bit of a love story. My only complaint is that the title of this Wool Omnibus Edition ( Wool1-5) Silo Saga makes it seem like you purchased the series but I only have Wool. Either that or I'm confused and as soon as this review is written I will be allowed to continue onto the series one book.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|The cost of the DVD is far less than going to the movies and the popcorn at home is ten times better than that at the theater  :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'd never even heard of candy crush until it was mentioned by my friends, so I decided to get and I loved it! By far the best puzzle game of this type. The only thing that gets me is that you have lives and if you run out you have to wait a long time to recharge. Kind of annoying. But it's great fun.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|it was ok i like how instead of using notes randomly i just use this this is a cool app if you are not orgonized
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting; Life....are there REALLY ever coincidences? Or do things always work out just as they are supposed too? This book does make one pause for a moment, or two, and consider their own life. I am thankful I can say I am pleased and blessed to be where I am overcoming where I have came from. The book definitely left me pondering about what I will never know about my life's cast of players! Great read!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Bridge of Sighs is a great classic cd!<br />I had this album before way back when I had an 8 track player 35 years ago - I wanted to get this again on cd and forgot how great the album is!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Once upon a time when  a women made a gingerbread cowgirl  she said giddy up giddy up you can`t get me I`m a cowgirl  as she ran  she met a cow a chicken a horse a Fox she met  a duck a snake and the same way as the first time when the women came by the gingerbread cowgirl and got the gingerbread cowgirl  and they got to eat the gingerbread cowgirl and made  another gingerbread  but this time they made a gingerbread  cowboy but they got tired after they made it .<br /><br />  The End
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Easy to set, no winding or battery required, and I love how it looks. I have small wrists, so dive watches or G-shock type watches are too big for me to wear comfortably long-term. The SNK809 is smaller, though a bit thick for the size of its face, and is very comfortable for me to wear all day, even typing at the keyboard. Finally, the included cloth band is more comfortable than most metal bands I've worn, and I like how it looks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although this may be considered a young adult book, I in my mid fifties, thoroughly enjoyed it! I couldn't put it down,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very intelligently written and for me it was a late night  page turner! Had a hard time putting the book down.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Spoilers Below**<br /><br />I don't review that often but I can now say I have seen all 3 films and Iron Man 3 was the cheesiest thing I have seen with this type of budget for a long time. I don't know if I am just old and cranky (I am 27yo guy) but I love good films. LOTR, Matrix, Bourne Identity, even The Avengers are all great movies. Iron Man 3 however misses the mark by doing things that just don't make sense.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Special Effects<br />* Robert Downy Jr's acting was solid<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Really no back story to the villain explained in the movie despite the fact that the comics have a well articulated background.<br />* Iron Mans new suit is a prototype throughout the movie that constantly gets knocked off his body in every fight and can be ripped off by almost anyone.<br />* Bad guys in the film have abilities that change when continent to the story. (Melt your face one moment, rip an iron man's helmet off the next)<br /><br />* Cheesiness example:<br />- Lady says \\"hey look at that missile 300 Ft away flying towards your house\\" which proceeds to move in Super slow motion until everyone looks at the T.V.<br />- Random kid happens upon Iron man in the middle of nowhere beaten and in temporary hiding and says \\"everyone thought you where dead..\\" and proceeds to hand Iron man a newspaper proclaiming his death that he carries around with him everywhere\\"<br />- Crazy Fire lady chases iron man with intent to kill him and gets handed a shotgun when she overpowers an idiot that walks up to her with a shotgun (Because Shotguns don't work unless you are within 1.20 feet of assailant)<br />- Iron Man needs to hack a satellite and so he immediately finds a news van with a tech inside who is able to \\"Boost Signal Strength 40%\\" by fiddling on the roof for 5 seconds.<br /><br />There are SOOO many more. seriously with the money poured into this film how hard is it for the director to actually try to put a movie together that that makes slightly moresense than this.<br />If you are reading this and you have never seen the film rent it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love the levels of difficulty and the ways the puzzles are set up. So glad this was the free app of the day. Love this game!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I prefer google for my searches because I always get the results that I'm looking for. I use google on my laptop, desktop, kindle and my phone.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I love this app.  The game is easy at the beginning.  You have to clear the cloth of all buttons, but they must be the same color when you eliminate them.  You can go straight up and down or sideways on a 45 degree angle.  As the games progress they get more challenging to eliminate the buttons as the colors are more disbursed through the piece of cloth.  When you highlight a group of buttons, the scissors comes in to clip them off the cloth to open the way for other colors of buttons to be eliminated.  It takes a bit of thought as the games grow in challenging your mind, but it is one of my favorites on my Kindle HD and I play it quite often in the evening.  Take a chance on this one - it's free, challenging and fun!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Best King Book?  Maybe, I loved 11/22/63. A lot!  But this was grand.  I felt the main crest half-way through and it was a great ride through to the end.  Can't think of anything I would have done differently.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This surpassed my hopes and expectations. Susan uses her full range throughout the songs and never misses a note. Her voice is serene and her selections are inspirational.  Her album is the perfect choice for reminiscing of childhood Christmases that still held magic. I hope she offers a new Christmas album each year she's recording!<br />Thank you Susan!!!
0812982606|5.0|This book is riveting, especially if you were around during the time the fatwa was issued on Mr. Rushdie.  It captures the era, and makes it richer and highly personalized, by adding the perspective of an amazing writer who was in the center of it all.  His poetic prose comes through (e.g., \\"...it would be his task, in the  years that followed, to rediscover, as Beauty did, the beauty in the Beast.\\")  There is also a self-deprecating honesty.  Most importantly, this is also a story of the temporary defeat of freedom of expression.  For many, it is mainly in hindsight that they realize the struggle to preserve the writer's right to write.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|I have had a fascination with vampires and things of that sort. This movie goes into the life of a vampire from a vampire's point of view. I don't think that I would want to live forever, oh but all the things one would see if they could.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This book is laugh out loud funny and touching too with characters you care about.  What a great idea for a book.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|This is a love story not only for loving someone else, but also learning to love yourself. I never get tired of watching this movie.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Lots of fun and lots of work!!!!!  Cute pets and houses.<br /> Earn more hearts by adding friend!  Add me please!!!!  Friend code ddd27f
B003G4W49C|4.0|This novel offers a great depth and breadth, encompasses so many disparate aspects of life and civilization that come together to create a rich canonical universe in one of my most favorite exercises in world building. Haunting prose and imaginative imagery.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|3 episodes in so far and man are things are changing!!!!  No shortage of walkers!!!!!! You never know who's gonna be gone next!!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Really awful , Mr hosseini should stop writing about Afghanistan. There are thousand of stories like these and many more interesting. The entire Greek insertion is totally irrelevant.<br />The originality of the Kite runner is lost and Mr hosseini doesn't seem to get it back.<br />After the equally disappointing sequel to the kite runner, I thought I'd give this one a chance. But sadly we have to recognize that some people are just one book writers
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie was gritty and intense at times. It was also very sad and bittersweet. It's important to note that this film didn't end in despair, like many films chronicling actual events tend to. This film also takes you straight into the middle of the tsunami without overdoing the carnage. Don't get me wrong. There are terrible things that happened, but the horror of it all is not the center of the story.<br /><br />The acting, as many have already said, was superb. The boy who played the oldest son did an amazing job, so much so that I felt as if I were watching a video of reality, not a movie. There was never a moment when I felt anyone was acting or hamming it up for Oscar buzz, which is a shame, because subdued but true performances are often overlooked by the Academy.<br /><br />Like any disaster where so many people lose their lives, I was haunted by this event, heartbroken for those who lost everything. This movie gave me a small sense of closure. I was not personally affected by the tsunami, so my emotional wellness is of little concern. But for what it's worth, watching this movie meant more to me than two hours of escapism.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love Mahjong so I decided to try this one.  It is lots of fun and different from just playing card games. Keeps you on your toes remembering where you saw that matching tile.  Addictive and fun. You can choose the difficulty level, how many tiles in play, and you can shuffle if you get stuck.
B00E8G5H6Y|1.0|Up date or not, right out of the package this will NOT play on my sony (bdp-s185) blu-ray player.<br />I have heard other people with the same problem.<br />Things like this should be fixed before the sets are released.
B007REV4T8|5.0|As a middle-aged dude who has watched ever single James Bond film enough to be able to recite dialogue, I have to say that Skyfall is one of THE BEST Bond films of all.  Yes, there are others, and everyone has their favorites, BUT Skyfall is an extraordinarily well-crafted blend of exceptional acting, superb script and well-balanced directing.  I've had people who literally dislike the Bond genre tell me they LOVED seeing this and thanked me for making them watch this.  In fact, I lent this dvd out and I have to get it back!  As I've said with other DVDs, there are some you buy and watch, and then there are those that are &#34;Go-To&#34; DVDs over and over again, even if you've seen it recently.  This is a MUST SEE and I like to have great DVDs with me for planes, trains and hotels.  THIS IS A GREAT FILM and DVD!
B002ZG99TK|3.0|OK movie to watch if bored or if one likes trains and this movie is predictable in the outcome.  Both major actors did a good job in their roles.  Nothing much to say, its watchable but nothing really note worthy to see it again.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great film with good acting and amazing special effects!  After spending $12 to see it at the cinema, this one is worth having with you for long flights, hotel stays, family get-togethers when no one has anything to watch.  This is another one added to my collection of go-to DVDs when I need a good flick, even if I've seen it recently-it's a great watch again and again.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|My mom acts like a teen and slaves over this terrible game. She just pays attention to her stupid iphone and nothing else. Its literally part of the mess my family has become. Thanks
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|This,in my opinion is the most listenable Pearl Jam album from start to finish since Ten. Huge fan,but as with most albums its rare to find one you don't feel like skipping any tracks on. Liked Backspacer but only loved 6-7 tracks. Highley recommend this one!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun to work out my brain. really like puzzle games.  worth the time and addictive.  give it a try you will be hooked
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved everything about this story. I loved the hopeless love, the selfless acts, and the desire to make a wrong right that was able to connect those living worlds away.
1451666179|5.0|This is one of the most brilliantly funny and insightful books I have ever read.  Laughed so hard and for so long I actually got a cramp. Just love Allie Brosh!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is not only beautiful but so talented. She delivers such an amazing sound with a dancing twist. Its fantastic!
B00DWAFB2C|5.0|Everyone complains on how this album is too soft etc etc and how its horrible. People seem to forget these guys have been making music for 20+ years. Everyone thought the \\"grunge\\" movement was a fade. Pearl Jam out lasted them all. They evolve with every album. I simple love this album and anyone who is stuck in the 1990s wake up and smell the coffee its 2013 my friends. PJ20
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love this game. Glad its finally on Kindle! Just wish it didn't take so long to finish a quest to unlock new levels!
1451666179|5.0|I bought this book for my girlfriend as a birthday present. She absolutely loves Allie Brosh's material. We were reading through it together and she was laughing so hard that she was crying at the very first comic. It was great.
0307386171|3.0|What a strange little book. Ian McEwan has a reputation for well written books, and although this was beautifully written it did not have much substance and the actions of the characters Florence and Edward are just not believable enough. There are major problems in this couples communication, which lead to a disaster of a honeymoon, This in itself is interesting enough, but it all is just a bit too bleak and miserable for my taste. The ending only enlightens us on Edwards life and feelings and not that of Florence which leaves a rather unfinished feeling . As I said a strange and also depressing book.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Can watch this show all day long. It is my favorite show. I have season one thru eight. Keep them coming!!
B005LAIGP0|5.0|A really good ghost story that didn't meet the critics expectations.  I need to stop listening to critics because i always disagree!  Love this movie and is a great ghost story!
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I really like the previous movies these two made together, &#34;Shawn of the Dead&#34;, &#34;Hot Fuzz&#34;, but this one is almost as entertaining.  That doesn't mean it isn't really good, it is, but those two are the best!
B002ZG9846|5.0|DIGITAL COPY IS EXPIRED!  I really liek this dark super hero movie, it is not tainted meet &#34;popular&#34; comic book movies.  Great time!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|These two singers are AMAZING!  And this album is exceptional.  I have always loved Vince Gill and this pairing of him with Paul Franklin is genius!
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|A wonderful retelling of the book!  The though of jay-z music in the 20's sounded a little ridiculous, but it was a great addition to telling this timeless tale!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|What's not to love?!?  It's Alan Jackson doing what he does best!  His style of singing lends itself perfectly to a bluegrass album.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|The best Iron man yet!  Some do not like that iron man has a version of ptsd, but i think it humanizes him!  I love the story line and movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad this is finally available for kinle fire! Now you need to make pet rescue saga available, too :)
B00288KNJU|5.0|Wonderful movie, but production of case and packaging is faulty.  When they packaged this film they over packed it with the 3D glasses causing it to break.  I have purchased this for several people, through several providers all cases were broken (Target, Best Buy, Amazon, and KMart).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't even count anymore how many times I've read this series. I love it! The characters, the storyline, it's a wonderful read.
B00887490Y|5.0|This story was AMAZING!  It was a direct to home media movie that was far better than most theatrical releases!
145210655X|5.0|My nephews love Star Wars.  This was light reading for the older one and a the perfect challenge for the younger one.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|This movies gives me the chills every time i see it!  Great acting talent that really makes you believe what you are watching!
B000035Z3K|5.0|great item
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Great live action version of the animated film!  I really enjoyed Jim Carrey in the role of the Grinch!  A few warnings about the packaging:  The Green Case is far more brittle than a normal bluray case.  I bought my initial copy at Walmart, the case was damaged and returned.  The Same thing happened with a target verison.  I bought my newest copy from amazon, same situation as well but i repackaged item into a after market blu-ray case that was double disk.  This is not Amazons fault, but manufacturing issue.  Also to note, the Green case does not old two discs, only holds one.  The DVD is in a paper sleeve.  I would recommend this product, but be aware that the case problems are not an issue based on seller (ie Amazon, Target, Walmart).
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Such a great love story. Love the characters. Great movie. Great battle scenes. Beautiful landscapes. A classic to add to your movie collection. Plus Mel Gibson is H-O-T
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Such an imaginative continuation to the Peter Pan stories!  I have always loved this movie, and you will too!  Glad i finally purchased!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|How can you not love Homeland!!  Really looking forward to the 3rd season.  Excellent video. Be prepared to become addicted when you start this series!
B0002S65W2|5.0|A thriller with horror elements!  A movie that has quickly become a favorite.  I will admit i was a little late to watching this movie, but i am glad i finally saw it in 2013!  This movie is not scary, so it should not be labeled as a horror movie, but it is thrilling.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Simple and really helpful, each step well explain and easy to follow.  A must read for those who start with Kindle
B00DXLO0D6|4.0|Great show, but terrible packaging!  The DVD's are in a void and just sit in a pile. The Show is wonderful but i find the new 2013 packaging far worse than the 2000 packaging (each DVD was in a sleeve).  I gave a 4/5 rating for the packaging alone!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|As usual, received on time as promised.  Couldn't wait to watch it with my daughter and wasn't let down.  Great movie and very nice very exciting in 3-D
B0059GVB5I|5.0|Not a feel good movie!  This movie does cover A LOT OF TABOO issues!  I do not recommend if you get offend easily, this movie will offend some audience members!
B00BWQW73E|1.0|I wanted to pick up this book to learn more from Bezos, then I learned that it's a fictional story and you never interviewed him. What a waste.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This movie is about robots, monsters, and fighting!  If you want more than that you might not like this movie!  This film does not lie about what it is, has attractive people in a world falling apart!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so excited that Candy Crush finally made it to the Kindle! I had been abut upset that the other devices had it &amp; I couldn't get it...thank you Amazon!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Scary and wonderful!  This movie is one of the best horror movies to come out!  Scary ghost story that should be in everyones collection!
B004JMY312|4.0|Best Halloween movie to watch with friends and family. Watching Hocus Pocus is our yearly tradition. It is 90's Disney at its best!
B00G722T22|5.0|I love this album, this reminds me of her first CD. A great mixture of pop rock music, and I feel like she really tried to make great tracks for the album. Go Avril!
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|This is a classic, beautifully done movie with two great stars. This movie will never grow old...wonderful, a pleasure to watch Audry Hepburn. Gregory Peck, as usual, does a superb job of acting.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|This movie has been on my husbands wish list for some time now.  We have looked for it everywhere.  Finally found it on Amazon and its a great movie. ( now that I finally got to see it)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Couldn't figure out what the big deal was about this game until I started playing. Every level is different; some are easy but most are very challenging. Keeps you coming back. The only thing I don't like is if you're not connected to Facebook you have do quests in order to keep moving up and it's a 24 hr wait time in between.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. I don't see why it got such poor reviews. Couldn't put it down. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
1452115567|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book. Would love to meet Maddie and her owner. If you are a dog lover this is a must have book !!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome and additive it starts out slow and gets super fast paced as u earn more points and coins high replay value
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card has been a dear friend and confidant of mine for more than 30 years. Granted, we met only once in Honolulu 30 years ago whilst skin-diving for conchs. But that meeting left an indelible mark on my career.<br /><br />He was just finishing the first draft of this very book, originally entitled \\"Eric's Game.\\" So like two brothers-in-arms, we spent many a Hawaiian twilight sipping Albino Mai Tai's and ruminating on the possibilities of extraterrestrial invasions. I argued that invertebrates make for terrifying antagonists. Orson however, disagreed. And we never spoke again.<br /><br />But his laser-like prose inspired something powerful inside of me--an unpublished, dystopian manuscript entitled \\"0101101\\" which was written entirely in binary code. Stephen Hawking dubbed it \\"highly unreadable.\\"<br /><br />So I am forced to revel in the greatest of Orson's masterworks, \\"Ender's Game,\\" content with the knowledge that I, Eric Jonrosh, still have yet to publish my own science-fiction epic. I can only compare this to my own heart-rending epic \\"The Spoils of Babylon\\" which is set to air on this very January the 9th, 2014. Fans of Mr. Scott Card's works may delight in a few subtle references to \\"Ender's Game,\\" for \\"The Spoils of Babylon\\" could have been dedicated to him, even though it is not. If you are reading this Orson, never forget the Mai Tai we shared on the warm, golden sand of Kailua Beach.<br /><br />Yours truly,<br /><br />Eric Jonrosh, Author of \\"The Spoils of Babylon,\\" coming soon to IFC.

0345803485|4.0|Now this, dear readers, is a lusty piece of fiction, indeed! I tore through it with prepubescent abandon of a stable boy tending to a pair of brooding mares. It oozes eroticism. With every page, I became more entranced by the densely layered characters this fine young upstart E.L. James has birthed. Anastasia, introverted, libidinous and ever climaxing. Christian, rich, randy and hell bent on ending world hunger. These two opposites attract like latex to a lint roller.<br /><br />I first heard about \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" as I was eavesdropping on a pair of young, 50-something housewives at a local Dunkin Donuts. I was drinking a Caramel Macchiato cut with a hearty pour of Bagpipes O'Toole Brand Scotch Whiskey. They were discussing the libertine source material in hushed, eager tones. Their sensual references to BSDM took me back to my early years as a lover. I apprenticed at an extremely popular BSDMHJMSNNBC club in Amsterdam for a time. I saw many magical things that glorious summer. If only young E.L. had consulted me! What stories of bonds and bondage I could have shared!<br /><br />Nonetheless, I do feel like I have, in some small yet marginally important way, influenced \\"50 Shades\\" through mine own great work, \\"The Spoils of Babylon,\\" set to air on IFC this January 9th, the year of our lord, 2014, which also steps into the world of forbidden romance and tawdry affairs. \\"The Spoils of Babylon\\" and \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" read like two great minds thinking as one. If you find yourself aching for more throbbing drama and pulsating literary members, tune in for the \\"The Spoils of Babylon\\" on IFC. Spend a few scenes with Devon and Cynthia Morehouse and you may find yourself imagining a fictional foursome of arousing proportions!<br /><br />Truly,<br /><br />Eric Jonrosh, author of \\"The Spoils of Babylon\\" coming soon to IFC
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I love having the weather readily available when I wake; I just wish the alarm was more functional.  It is not nearly as loud and annoying as I need an alarm to be.  If you can awake to quiet sounds this will be perfect for you.  Me, I need a little more noise.
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first 2 books in the \\"Divergent\\"series. The story kept me engaged and I loved the characters - Tris, Four, Uriah, Christina, and their group of friends - as well as the world that Veronica Roth created.<br /><br />My question for Veronica Roth on \\"Allegiant\\" is - WHY?????????<br /><br />** SPOILERS **<br /><br />Why does this third book change so drastically with no relation to the plotlines, premise and characterizations that you built up in \\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent\\"? Why did you write such an empty, hollow story and in such a way that completely severed the audience's emotional connection to characters that they have loved?<br /><br />I could go on and on, but other readers have already said what I would like to say: \\"disappointing,\\" \\"hollow, \\" left you drained,\\" \\"ending has no sense of hope,\\" \\"non-sensical deaths,\\" \\"empty,\\" \\"boring,\\" \\"devoid of emotional ties and connection.\\" I agree with other readers who indicate that they felt betrayed by Roth. I felt that as well and it is such a shame that the two books that I have loved are now completely damaged by this third, non-sensical conclusion to the story. I wish Veronica Roth made different choices to this book. The way the author set up the two narrative voices of Tris and Four (and flipped back and forth between them on EVERY - yes, EVERY - other chapter) just made it impossible for the audience to develop an emotional connection to the characters and the story. Did she really need to shift back and forth so often - too often that jarred the reader at every turn and prevented us from feeling continuity in the story and the character's point of view? In addition, this process made Tobias' thoughts too exposed. Any good fiction writer with a female protagonist understands that the male (romantic) protagonist always has to leave a sense of mystery in the eyes of his love interest. Even Stephenie Meyer understood this on the \\"Twilight\\" series. While we knew Jacob's thoughts, Edward's was often a mystery. Knowing Four's every thought and word diminished this sense of mystery. Four's character was also altered from a strong, protective, authoritative figure to a petulant, weak young man. I loved Tobias in books 1 and 2 but he ends up a battered and unrecognizable character in this one. And let me not even start with Tris. What Roth did with Tris was non-sensical in my eyes.<br /><br />I wish she decided to continue where she left off - continued with the characters and portrayals that she built; continued with the premise and plotlines that she created and developed and that the fans loved in the first two books; and fulfilled the destiny that was meant for Tris and Four - working together to rebuild the societies that have fallen apart (whether in Chicago or outside the wall) and mend the broken relationships with friends and family around them. Not like this. I did not expect this. I am upset, confused and angry about what she did with Tris and Four and how she ended this story.<br /><br />My final advice to anyone who is curious about how the story ends. Don't bother. Ignorance is bliss. You are better off just reading books 1 and 2. This book has ruined the series for me. I felt emotionally drained and empty. Angry. Devoid of feeling for the characters or the story by the time it ended. There is nothing in this book that gives audiences a semblance of hope or felt uplifting. Veronica Roth has not learned what Suzanne Collins, JK Rowling, JRR Tolkien, Jane Austen and many other successful and loved authors before her knew - that even with all the trials and tribulations that the hero or heroine go through in their journey, the ending has to lift the audience up and provide a sense of hope for the main lead(s). Harry Potter lost friends and family on his path to become a great wizard and beating Voldemort, but he survived and will rebuild with his best friends Hermione and Ron beside him. Katniss and Peeta may have gone through hell and back in the \\"Hunger Games\\"series - but in the end they will heal together. Frodo goes off with Gandalf, Bilbo and the elder elves to the Undying Lands while Sam, Merry and Pippin live on and raise families and Aragorn fulfills his destiny as King of Gondor in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Elizabeth Bennett marries Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\" And yet, here, Veronica Roth decides to rip the hearts of the audience apart and  leaves a torn Tobias and uncertain future for the very few left in the story.<br /><br />What a waste of an opportunity to end the story in a way that remains faithful to the spirit of the first two books. No thanks to Veronica Roth for ruining the series. This is going to be the first time where I hope Hollywood makes A LOT of changes when (if) they eventually make the 3rd film. Because at this point, nobody will want to watch this movie when it makes its way to the theaters. I know I won't.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Thoroughly impressed with the heft of this knife.  I have not used it in a camping environment, but I have no doubt it will perform just as described in Amazon’s write up and in YouTube videos.  I do have a small problem with the sheath.  The snap on the retaining strap just barely barely does reach.  I have yet to be able to set the snap with one hand.  So far it (for me) takes two hands and a struggle to close this snap.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Still, good knife – should perform well.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is a wonderful series.  All the seasons are wonderful.  I have enjoyed having this on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|Amazon again sold us an HD movie and then around 6:30 - 7:00 pm as Amazon movie watchers signed in greater numbers we lost the HD version again and could not get it back without a huge rewind / restart hassle. For this particular movie we just gave up. My system has plenty of bandwidth for HD movies and we have watched virtually 50 - 60 HD movies from Amazon no problem but not on Friday and Sat nights. Amazon needs to up their bandwidth and system server performance for HD movies on weekend evenings as what they are selling right now usually does not hold HD into the evening hours. I love the quality of the movies and 5.1 sound of Amazon movies but on weekend evenings my confidence and performance vote for this service goes way down.<br /><br />Keith Campbell
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Great album, while some fans are stuck on a &#34;particular&#34; Pearl Jam sound, like everyone they evolve. I pre-ordered the album, delivery was the day after the release and have enjoyed it ever since. if you like Rock music and Eddie you will enjoy Lightning Bolt, Enjoy! only down side is they aren't touring anywhere near Florida to enjoy it live.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|It won't charge my kindle. I plug it into my kindle and it won't charge it at all. Not happy.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|This is a great movie!  My kids kept talking about it for two days after they viewed it.  They really enjoyed it.
B008MM9630|5.0|Fairy farm has s just the right combination of the fun and whimsy that makes games like this work.<br />Love the colors and the designs.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|We loved Percy Jackson here (myself, husband, and our two sons).  And we loved the first book of this series.  The second was good - but for a bit too much sappy teeny-bopper romance.  The third has PAGES and PAGES of nauseatingly detailed accounts of how she felt when he looked at her and why did he say that the way he did and what if he thinks this or that and etc, etc, etc, etc....  And this occurs in nearly every chapter!!  Did Rick Riordan receive some advice from someone to increase the readership among pre-teen girls by drastically upping the romance content?  It was bad advice.  This third book was so annoying to wade through that we're not even bothering with the fourth. My son (13yo) was wanting to just read a plot summary of the 4th book to save himself the bother of wading through pages of adolescent love-sick journal entries.  We have heard that the 4th book is even worse than this one, in this regard. So sad.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Because of paying for more things to play with and i just want to play the game guess i just don't get the concept of it so for that reason i won't be playing that much
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie despite it having Tom Cruise. It hardly has any Morgan Freeman in it, despite being on the cover as well. But this movie is good speculative sci-fi with characters showing us a story. There's no obvious villain for most of the movie, so some people may find its pacing slow, but it has wonderful layers that it peels back throughout the story.<br /><br />Minus one star for Tom Cruise.
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|This is a BEAST of a card. Overclocking is a breeze with ASUS's GPU Tweak software that is really well programmed. If you want to settle for nothing else than top tier performance without dropping off to insane prices, look no further. It will play any current game with maxed out settings like a hot knife through butter.<br /><br />Quick Benchmark: I tested Battlefield 4 at 1440p on ultra settings. I get around 50 fps overclocked. BF4 is an extremely demanding game, and this is the card to meet those demands.
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|I prefer this Riddick movie over the more recent sequels. This one still has action and Riddick being awesome, but he has to work as part of a team to succeed and the other characters are actually useful/interesting to various degrees.<br /><br />Minus one star because the CGI is pretty dated at this point.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Ever since i heard the first track off of Ten, I have been a HUGE Pearl Jam fan.  They have easily become my favorite band and I consider them the closest thing us 30+ year olds have to a Led Zeppelin.  As much as it pains me to say, the past several PJ albums have been disappointing to me.  Then having to wait 5 years for new music was adding salt on the wound but it is all better now.  This album is amazing and has me excited to see them live again!!!  It is by far their best release since Yield and I highly recommend getting it.<br /><br />One thing you will notice on this album is that Eddie's voice has never sounded better.  Even the lyrics are top notch from start to finish.  It starts off strong with \\"Getaway\\" and \\"Mind Your Manners\\".  All Jeff Ament fans are going to love the bass in \\"Father's Son\\".  The song \\"Sirens\\" is a beautiful power ballad and it gets stuck in your head so easily.  \\"Lightning Bolt\\" is an instant classic and can easily be the best song on the album.  Another standout is the old school rock vibe of \\"Let the Records Play\\".  Aside from these rocking songs, there are 3 other slower songs that are just as enjoyable: \\"Infallible\\", \\"Pendulum\\", and \\"Yellow Moon\\".  My only complaint about the album is the song, \\"Sleeping by myself\\", which is just a rehashed song from Eddie's Ukulele album.  It is awful and doesn't belong here.
B002ZG9800|5.0|The movie was funny and honest. Some laugh-out-loud moments and some heart-squeezing moments. The romance parts were sweet despite mostly taking place in prison. In fact, from a relationship point of view they were probably better off in prison!
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|This movie is perfect for my 3 yr old. He constantly is fascinated by the cars (of course, he is a HUGE fan of any automobile). Such a cute movie.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|While I'm glad there's finally a Facebook app for Kindle that's not just the mobile version, it's annoying to not be able to update as they become available.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I like the music.  Alan Jackson did a great job of doing some thing new.  I love his other albums and will grow to love this one.  The music was well blended and recorded.
B00DCX08MW|2.0|Extremely hard to land without crashing.  Don't mind a learning curve, but this is ridiculous.  Aren't there any flying games between ridiculously hard and ridiculously easy?
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game rules! The thing about the thing about Grevous having a slingshot is true. You can play on the  Pork Side, what means you get to be Vader, the Emporer,  Jango , Grevous, Dooku,Droidekas, and droids! JUST PLAY THE GAME, DUDE. JUST PLAY THE GAME!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|I love it, even if it's difficult because I've never flown an RC plane, but would like to.  So, in essence, I'm using this as a learning device.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This show has an awesome cast and it never gets old.  My husband and I laugh at every show.  Keep it coming for many years!!
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Celine and this album is what the \\"Taking Chances\\" album should have been. That's the only album of hers I didn't care for as a whole but on this album Celine is back singing edgier songs but with the same emotion and passion she is known for. One of the best albums of the year and one of the best albums of her career! Love you Celine! :)
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was a pleasure experiencing the evolution and maturation of the trilogy's themes from beginning to end. I went back and reread the first and second before reading Allegiant and I am glad I did - it is a mistake and a disservice to expect this book to revisit or recreate what the reader experienced in Divergent or Insurgent, and I suspect that doing so is why some people were not happy with the book.<br /><br />Yes, there were some holes in the story, but anyone used to reading fantasy has long comes to terms with glossing over events that do not hold up to scrutiny, provided that they are not germane to the central story line. The one issue that did trip me up was the overabundance of blind trust exhibited by the central characters in the final rebel plot, particularly in light of their often noted skepticism. As if a viral truth serum had been deployed.<br /><br />I was surprised by the depth of emotion I experienced reading the final chapters, which I feel is a testimony not only to Ms Roth's skill as a writer but also to her eloquent insightfulness when describing complex human emotional experiences.
0764141201|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is trying to improve his English.  I was pretty amazed at the conversational quality of the writing.  And, I had no idea phrasal verbs were such a fundamental part of the English language.

B005EGXNLS|5.0|Wow! I fell in love with this author within the first 3 pages. His attention to detail is incredible but not boring. His sense of humor is injected appropriately. His view of history is impelling. The characters are to love or hate but so interesting I couldn't wait to find where the fates would take them.  I  flew through this book, ordered the rest of the series and will probably order everything he writes!
0316172324|5.0|Great book, haven't finished it but about half way through now. A really good read for anybody interested in the way our minds work
B007L96VCY|5.0|RAM is a classic anyway but the bonus tracks (which are a compilation of B-sides) makes it a must own!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I own a large variety of watches; however, this watch has quickly become a favorite.  In fact, it is the watch I find myself wearing just about every day thanks to its comfortable band, easy-to-read dial, and durability/reliability.  True, the watch loses a few seconds a day, but that is the reality of owning an automatic wristwatch--and, if it becomes an issue, it is easily rectified with a minor adjustment.  The 21-jewel movement, although manufactured by Seiko's factory in Malaysia, winds itself easily and maintains power for more than 24 hours when fully charged by your physical motion or a watch-winder.  Having owned the watch for several months, I have absolutely no quality-related concerns with this wonderfully assembled and executed chronological little workhorse.<br /><br />The watch is water resistant enough to expose to the bath/shower, and it can even be given a nice scrub with a small toothbrush and a little dish soap.  That's when you'll appreciate the finish given to the watch case: on top, it is a nice matte-finish of the stainless steel carapace; underneath, the stainless steel shines with a lovely polish.<br /><br />It's a lot of watch for not a lot of money--one of the best watch-values Seiko offers, in my humble opinion.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I'm not really a fan of Brandon Sanderson but I'm glad I decided to give this one a go.  I loved it.
B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|Too many &#34;songs&#34; that weren't songs.  Guess I should have paid better attention to the length of the tracks and only downloaded singles rather than the full CD.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|What can one say, other than...WOW! CBS Digital did an amazing job of taking Star Trek: The Next Generation into the 21st century. The picture and sound is incredible. They have kept everything original, recreating faithfully any effects that were not available from footage, or was missing. The model shots that ILM did back in the day of the Enterprise D during TNG's run are amazing. I feel there is a reason that TNG has been brought to Blu-Ray: it had the longest run of all the &#34;Trek&#34; TV series, and was the most popular show in syndication. To this day, this classic show is still being shown in reruns around the world. You have to see this show in Blu-Ray to experience it to the fullest. One of the best episodes of Season 3 was &#34;Sins of the Father.&#34; This was the beginning  of a series of fantastic stories revolving around Worf, and the Klingon Empire. Another favorite was &#34;Deja Q&#34;, where the infamous villain Q loses his god status, and must learn humility, and what being human is all about. And who could forget &#34;Yesterday's Enterprise&#34;, with the Enterprise C coming through a time rift. That fateful episode had severe consequences in future seasons. This was just one of many examples of why TNG was such a success.
B00DI75SWM|3.0|i got this from a friend, so ya know, i thought it might be fun! It really is, but it keeps sayin whenever i try to download it, ot says that Keep Calm And Carry On, has stopped working!! it makes me so mad!!!
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is well worth the money I had to go to my parents home and I didn't get bored a single second of this game
B00B0CU2CI|3.0|I cannot understand why the critics have raved about this book! It's a good read, but difficult to empathise with the main character. It's a sort of rambling story with very little happening throughout.
1451666179|5.0|Hilarious and charming. Love owning the old stories in hard copy and loved the intermingling of classics and new tales. The new stories are wonderful and my husband and I laughed lots while reading the stories out loud. Definitely pleased to add this to my bookshelf.
B008R96NIY|5.0|I rarely read non-fiction and at over 600 pages this was a daunting book. However, the writing style is great and the whole thing thunders along. The history Clark delivers goes back a thousand years or more and covers all of Europe and then some; so it's very comprehensive yet accessible. Despite the wide array of people, places and events, the focus of the book - the triggers which started The Great War - is never lost. Superb read, well recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A this is a way to say I like it in so very many words in only one sentence here.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|What a Wonderful Representation of the 50th Anniversary Tour. I was amazed when I heard the original lineup including Brian Wilson were doing a new album and a tour! I never thought I would live see the day! Both were great the new album and the tour! I saw them in Berkeley at the Greek Theater and the show was just amazing from beginning to end. All of the hits are here and it is a nice touch that they even played to recordings of Carl and Dennis Wilson so they could be included in it. I am not sure why I waited so long to pick up this CD but I am sure glad I finally got it! The minute I put it on the magic of that night in Berkeley came back to me as the music flooded the room with Good Vibrations. If you love the beach boys I would highly recommend that you pick up this 2 disc set with a whooping 41 tracks on it! I am sure you will enjoy the magic of the show too! The CD is well worth the price of admission!
B003Y5H574|5.0|Cute movie.  More adult theme.  Quite funny in parts.  Not one I'd probably watch over and over like I usually do with Romantic Comedies, but it was cute.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Not my favorite James Bond movie.  I do like Daniel Craig, but the movie relied more on effects than story.
B0099114WO|1.0|I have to say, this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Can we say too much sexual content that wasn't needed!  Such good actors were wasted on this one.  It went out to the trash and we didn't even finish watching it.  The only funny parts were what was shown in the previews...sadly.
0307949486|5.0|Simply wow. This book is not for sentitive people as it's quite graphic and brutal at times. However, it is one of the best books I've read in a long, long time!<br /><br />Summary (with spoilers)<br />Henrik Vanger, head of an old industrial family, is being tortured for decades by the killer of his niece Harriet by sending him the same birthday present his niece used to give him before her disappearance in 1966: a dried flower in a frame.<br /><br />Mikael Blomquist, renowned journalist and editor-in-chief of the independent magazine Millennium, is sentenced to 3 months in prison for libel after writing an article on the businessman Wennerstroem that lacks any kind of evidence.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, hacker, hermit, with serious emotional issues and a dark past is fighting against her new, sadistic legal guardian.<br /><br />The paths of these three very different people crosses after Lisbeth receives the assignment to research Mikael Blomquist for Henrik Vanger, who then invites the journalist to make the newly-convict an unlikely offer: to write his biography, and, as a secret side mission, to investigate the murder of his niece, which has never been solved; in return, he offers Mikael information to finish Wennerstroem once and for all. Mikael, who has to take a leave of absence from his magazine in order to avoid further damage after the disastrous article against the will of his partner (and occasional lover) Erika, decides to accept the offer and moves to a cottage at the Vanger estate.<br /> He learns the details on the disappearance of Harriet Vanger several decades ago; her uncle is convinced that she was murdered, most likely by a member of the vast Vanger family, even though her body was never found. During his painstaking research under the cover of writing a biography, he meets several members of the Vanger clan who still live on the estate and stumbles into an affair with Cecilia, another one of Henrik’s nieces. However, all the clues Mikael finds are either inconclusive or soon lead him to a dead end. As he works, he notices slight oddities on his computer, and as Henrik informs him about the background search he had conducted on him, Mikael is set on Lisbeth’s trail through her employer.<br /> As he confronts her, she is devastated about being recovered but agrees to work with him on the investigation of a series of Old Testament-inspired murders, that leads back to the Vanger family. Mikael also manages to locate a woman, who has taken a picture that helps him complete a scene of Harriet’s last day: she stares in panic at a young man hidden in the crowd at a parade. However, as Mikael and Lisbeth, who have also started an affair, learn more about the circumstances at the time of Harriets disappearance, strange things are happening. Someone breaks into the cottage the two of them live in, a few days later, the cat that roams the property is found skinned on the steps of the front door, and someone shoots at and wounds Mikael in the woods. They know that they are on the right track and intensify their efforts to identify the murderer of all these women and potentially even Harriet, even though by that time, Mikael and Lisbeth already have the strong suspicion that Harriet may not be dead after all, as they find another woman, who has astounding similarity with Harriet, on old family pictures. While researching the dates of the murders in the archives and comparing them to the Vanger family travel schedules, Lisbeth discovered that Harriets brother Martin is the killer, not his father as they had previously thought, and most likely the young man in the picture that sent Harriet into a panic the afternoon of her disappearance.<br /> At the same time, Mikael, who also identified Martin as the most likely subject and tried to confront him, finds himself in Martin’s private torture chamber. Martin tells him that he had tortured and killed countless women in that chamber over the years, but that his most valued prize, Harriet, has slipped through his fingers. As Lisbeth sees all the missed calls from Mikael on her phone, she races to him and manages to save him from Martin, who flees and dies as his car crashes into an oncoming truck on the road.<br /> With the new information, Mikael and Lisbeth focus on Harriet’s look-alike aunt, who lives in London and cut most ties to the family. As she refuses to talk to them, Lisbeth installs spyware and the two listen in on a phone call that is made to Australia. With this information, they manage to locate Harriet, who lives under an assumed name as the owner of a large corporate farm in Australia. Mikael goes and meets her, where she tells him the story of her abusive childhood and how she fled on the fateful day as her brother returned to kill her before she could confide in her uncle for help. She was also the one who kept sending the dried flowers to Henrik as a sign that she is still alive.<br /> Uncle and niece are reunited and also decide to merge their companies as Harriet assumes the role of CEO of Vanger Corporations while her sons take over the agricultural company in Australia. Mikael returns as editor-in-chief to Millennium with an article that indeed breaks Wennerstroem, while a small woman in several disguises relieves him of several millions stored in banks in Switzerland.<br /> Back in Sweden, Lisbeth is trying to clean up her apartment as she admits deeper feelings for Mikael to herself. She goes to buy a Christmas present for him as disguise to go and visit him again. However, as she is on her way to his apartment, she sees him leaving a nearby caf&eacute; with Erika, turns around and goes home after tossing the present.st valued prize, Harriet, has slipped through his fingers.

B008JFUNHI|5.0|Astonished by the story and the young star. This movie thrilled and fascinated me. I will be reading the book because the movie characterization of Ender (played by Asa Butterfield) shows an extraordinary person not easily, convincingly, found anywhere in cinema; a child's intelligence disciplined to the degree that we see a boy who truly blurs the line between child and adult. I figure it can only happen in a writer's mind and am grateful to the director for aiming so well at the writer's concept. Even if the question of age is not on target for some, the result raises eyebrows and makes age and maturity more of a mystery than I ever thought possible.<br /><br />Ender is obviously a child, but is gifted with a self-awareness that no child possesses. His military severity, coupled with great empathy and compassion, makes him much more than his age. But his innocent face begs the question, what is appropriate or inappropriate to have a child do, even at our country's most desperate hour? As if fighting and war are somehow more moral than any number of crimes against children. Of course, I value this movie for the way it uses fiction to make me think and not to get all wrapped up in serious issues. But I find it amazing that the boy-man concept could be brought to the screen so perfectly, so intelligently, in the performances of all involved. It's haunting and this is definitely one for my collection.
0743298039|3.0|An enjoyable read for a quiet winter weekend. The twin phenomenon is a little too drawn out at times, which for me hurt the story more than it helped.<br /><br />Summary (with spoilers)<br /><br />argaret Lea, a young woman who has grown up in her father's antique book store among the tomes of centuries past, is contacted by the world-famous novelist, Vida Winter to write her biography. Margaret hesitantly follows the invitation to Vida's countryside home, drawn by the promise to be given the truth about her life, of which is next to nothing known to the public, and potentially learn about the thirteenth tale of her debut novel, which had been missing. Once arrived, Margaret is drawn in by the family story of Miss Winter, who reveals her birth name, Adeline March: the twins Adeline and Emmeline are born out of the incestuous relationship between the siblings Isabelle and Charlie. After Isabelle's hospitalization at a mental insitution and her untimely death, Charlie retreats to his study, barely to be seen by anyone. The twins are being raised by the aging house keeper and display peculiar behavior early on. Upon the recommendation of he village doctor, a governess is hired when the girls were teenagers, to try and mold them into functioning people by rules and structure. While Emmeline, who seems to be mentally retarded complies, Adeline, who displays feral behavior, rebels. As a last attempt to civilize the girls, the governess suggests an experiment of separating the twins to the doctor, who takes Adeline in. Both girls are devastated at their separation, but while Emmeline slowly adapts, Adeline has fallen into absolute lethargy. Eventually, the experiment fails and the twins are reunited as the governess suddenly disappears. The twins are now alone again; both the house keeper and the gardener, who have taken care of them since birth die, and Emmeline becomes pregnant by the gardener's assistant. Shortly after Emmeline gives birth to a little boy, their house,Anglefield, burns down. Adeline leaves the boy at the doorstep of a neighbor and disappears, taking care of Emmeline, who is badly burned. As the story unrevels, Vida's strength wanes. On her deathbed she confides in Margaret that there had been a secret third girl, the ghost of Anglefield house, the daughter of Charlie with a peasant girl, who was abandoned by her mother at the garden gate as a little child but found and nurtured back to health by the housekeeper and the gardener to live in the shadows unnoticed. Due to her striking similarity to Adeline, she assumes her role after their guardians' deaths to take care of the affairs. At the night of the fire, the girl without a name saves Emmeline's baby as Adeline tries to burn the boy in the fireplace out of jealousy. She manages to save Emmeline, who ran into the flames to rescue her son, just to realize that she has indeed saved Adeline with her face badly burned. Shortly after the end of the story, Vida Winter dies; Margaret decides to not publish the story but to leave it for the family of Emmeline's son, who she had met during her research. She does, however, find the long-lost thirteenth tale in a letter from Vida, which is the story of Charlie and her mother, of her childhood and how she was abandoned, written like a Cindarella story gone wrong.

0316219266|5.0|I worked at amazon from 1999-2007. I've never worked anywhere that was so demanding, fast paced, aggressive, or whimsical. With that said, I've never learned so much. It was an amazing experience. Brad captures the culture and vibe of the company during that time. In many cases, he toned it down a bit. The OLR process was even more intense than he writes, as an example. There was far more yelling and near personal attacks then he shares, etc.<br /><br />I'm proud to have been a part of the revolution.  Thanks, to brad for capturing the history.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|got here reALLY QUICKLY AND i LOVE IT...LOVE THE eAGLES THIS IS STUPID MORE WORDS ARE REQUIRED LETS KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET
B008JFUO72|5.0|I think this is my favorite of the three Iron Man movies because so much of takes place without the help of his suit.  It shows that Tony is the hero and not just the suit.
B000000OU0|5.0|LOVE IT JUST PLAYED IT ON THE WAY TO WORK THIS MORNING GREAT PRICE AND CAME VERY QUICKLY LOVE THE EAGLES
B001KZG99A|5.0|Awesome, awesome, Awesome! I usually don't like the comic book genre movies, but this one got me. I Definitely recommend.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem's back, slim is back. Every song is epic he goes hard in every single one of these songs, my personal favorite is evil twin.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Lots of action. Great story line.This is a movie I could watch more than once.  More than two thumbs up!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works well with android tablet (hisense jelly bean) took a number of tries to connect to network initially (chromecast recognized network and presented matching ids on screen and tablet). When it connected, chromecast dongle updated itself, and has connected reliably since.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Not quite as good as the first, but it sets up more plot for the sequels. Can't wait for Iron Man 3.
B00EJOCAYW|4.0|While I am told this is an epic gift, I was a bit disappointed at how expensive it was for the number of pcs in the set when compared with other Lego sets with similar pcs.  It is a very cool set, but it'll cost you. That is the only reason for the 4 stars.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A truly inspiring, compelling journey from a totally credible source.  I laughed and cried and came away with an even stronger belief in God.  I would highly recommend everyone, believer or not, read this book.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I was looking for an app do I could keep organized and this was the best one by far. I was looking for something that had a checklist and a calendar this is the best one. Letting you customize it how you want is an important thing for a unorganized artist like me. I TOTALLY love this. Although when it gives you a notification it doesn't tell you which app it is coming from I still love it though.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|This Blue Ray set is great technically; very nice restoration. But, in my opinion, the original Godfather with Brando is FAR superior to the other two films. So unless you are a fan of the genre, just buy the original Godfather and save a few bucks.
B00001W9G0|5.0|I don't know if I stand alone, but I didn't feel this was a mutual love story, from watching women discuss this movie prior to my purchasing it, I thought it was similar to Casablanca, two people madly in love but who part in the end. That said it was a beautiful movie, and it just made me think of when you're in a relationship with someone who is checked out, but you never realize it, I don't think her character ever did, Hubble was not a great guy, but she was a great girl.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine's vocals sound amazing against the awesome bass lines across the album. Love listening using surround sound and in the car. I also purchased the Deluxe Edition. &#34;How Do You Keep the Music Playing&#34; really plays with my emotions.
B00F2HW220|5.0|As much as I love Arjen's works, futuristic stories and music never took a big part on my 'plate', I listened to every once in a while for a change of taste. But this album does not fall in that, this is far more than just a taste changer, this is something I can listen to with my eyes close and be a part of put it on a stereo and be loud!<br />This is so versatile and creative! All the musicians did a great job and Arjen did get the best out of them as well!<br />Great work...really great work!
B00275EGX8|4.0|Remember that John Lennon lyric?  That probably came to him with Vietnam in mind.  I was old enough to be drafted by the end of that war.  Went from being classified 1A to 1H (holding) as the draft and that war wound down.  I always wondered if I would have survived.  Movies like this and Platoon and Saving Private Ryan always remind me of that and just how much I hate everything to do with war and what it does to families.  It reminds me how democracy and a free press ended that conflict as public outcry eventually won, and it makes me wonder where that free press is during this war.  It reminds me that 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes pegged our species more than any other in that he stated that we are mostly given to selfishness and violence in our most natural state.  We hardly attain the youthful age of twenty before we're ready to kill.  And something as simple and arbitrary as beliefs, religious and cultural, neither of which are valid reasons, are all it takes to justify the violence in our minds.<br /><br />This movie, like all Hollywood movies, can only be expected to be technically accurate up to a certain point . . . After all it is a movie and not a documentary.  But it was real enough to bring all of that to mind.  It reminded me how our patriotic youth trust both the people in this country and our government to consider their welfare above everything else before putting them in harms way.  But I always have doubts about misplaced trust.  In Alan Greenspan's book he declares that the current conflict is largely about oil.  If that's true, then we are derelict in our duties to drive our elected leaders to do something about our gluttony when it comes to consumption of energy sources.  We are less than five percent of the earths human population but use 25% of the oil dredged up from the ground.  We import too much of that oil from places that keep the pressure pot boiling.  By contrast, Brazil is completely free of foreign sources of energy, growing it's own sugar cane crop to supply ethanol instead.  We've know since the early '70s that this was a serious problem.  I remember the long lines at the gas pumps then. And we knew that by simply changing our energy policy and fuel efficiency standards that it would equate to millions if not billions of barrels of oil per year.  And now we know the scientific facts concerning global warming and air contamination.  Forty years later, almost a half century too late, we are just beginning to wake up from our irresponsible slumber.  A nocturnal state that puts our forces, mostly Christian, in foreign territories, mostly Muslim, where we are not welcome.  To that extent, understanding the fanatical nature of our species to date, we are risking attack.  If we want to end war and keep our youth from harm, we have to change our own mentality and influence our political officials to act responsibly.  Now.  Our devotion to our patriots can't just be flag waving and patriotic song.<br /><br />This was a good movie. Like a train wreck, you can't stop watching. In many respects, it's too real.  But the truth is, I don't like war movies.<br /><br />I don't want to see the \\"next\\" generational war movie twenty years from now.
B0089LOG02|1.0|R eceived an corrupted file on my computer not my kindle.So have never read.WOULD LIKE TO READ.This is so absurd
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is pretty addictive.  I love the fact that it's not just gravity up/down like the original versions of Angry Birds, but also has planet gravities that you need to take into consideration.  My 4 year old loved it when she first saw the game on my Roku.
B00AEFY66U|3.0|Redford was only in this movie maybe 45 minutes? Had a hazy appearance to it....dreamlike maybe. Gather it was filmed that way? Compared to new one, this one was darker and sadder.
B00EIMJVOM|5.0|Jessie J has proven herself as a great singer and performer especially during the iTunes festival. It made me get the album!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Helps me organize all the things that inspire me. Hair styles in like, outfit ideas (comes in handy when shopping)
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I kept wanting to turn the page to see what else was going to happen. It had a twist at the end that I was not expecting. A very good read.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is pretty cool and free game. It would be better if you could upgrade your robots punching speed, if you didn't have to wait on your power  core to recharge in order to play.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I've been a life long Eminem die-hard. Being from the state of Michigan, I grew up listening to him. Always being stoked with every album he released. Up until Relapse.. I thought he had lost his flow and creative ability. The he releases Recovery which was amazing. From the beats, to the lyrics, and the overall flow. In my opinion, that was his best album since the original Marshall Mathers LP. Then he puts out this album.. and wow.. all I have to say is the Eminem I grew up listen is BACK! Everything about this album is off the charts. He uses an amazing amount of passion and lyrical flow with this album. This potentially could be one of the top albums of 2013 in my opinion.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|After reading the instructions, I carefully started to use the slide scanner.  I was pleased with how easy it was to learn to use, quick too.  I have already copied 57 boxes.  That's over 1000 scans.  The quality of the saved file is also very nice.  I look forward to doing a lot more conversions.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|My review would be the same as the other Hugh Laurie CD. Great music, bluesy. Hugh is multi talented- piano, guitar, singing and he puts on a fun show. This is a recommend.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My son was hoping for only 2 sounds, not four, but this was an unknown factor when ordered.  Otherwise satisfied.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|Too many things to remember. Help is not available on what to use. Screen does not expand very much to search for items. I prefer fun hidden object games not ones that are on a timer basis and way to much going on so it is confusing.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is fun and helps me get rid of my boredom.My friend and I play this a lot.fun for children and adults.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|It is an excellent portrayal of the whole era as well as a magnificent story of one of the greatest race horses.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I love Kik but it's not working for my android devices please fix this problem I need to talk to my girl I prefer this more than texting
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|Who doesn't love polar bears, and the premise of a polar bear sitting in an inner tube being slung by a slingshot down a tenpin bowling alley made of ice is a fun idea.  Powler Bowler does have nice graphics with a Coca Cola style polar bear wearing a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses being quite visually spectacular, more so after each frame played, than in the actual tenpin bowling part of the game.  You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this so you can play it anywhere.  It is repetitive though, you're doing the same thing over and over again, so it does get a bit boring after a while.  Worth checking out if it's still free but not one you'll play every day, or even often due to a lack of variety of actions for play as well as what you see on your screen.
B00FMZSN8Y|5.0|My 2 and 3 year old love this! I was skeptical because of the one star review but I bought it anyways and I'm glad I did. One star was unnecessary. Buy it! Your kids will love it and you will too!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This a visually impressive and fun game to check out and it is very entertaining while you explore the various dumb ways to die by doing stupid things and you can easily see why this became a viral marketing success. I certainly don't know of any other safety campaigns that you can get as Amazon game apps.  I don't know how effective the campaign would be though to stopping people doing stupid things in relation to trains and getting killed, since that's not really the message your thinking about when playing the game/watching the song video you unlock after completing various stages.  More successful popularity wise a game/song video than preventing rail deaths probably, but your going to be looking at downloading this for the fun experience rather than to learn a lesson and change your behaviour around trains for the better, anyway.<br /><br />The thing is though, although you'll enjoy this immensely the first time you play it, or even subsequent times when you show it to friends, it's not really one that you'll play over and over again.  There's nothing to achieve (other than unlocking new characters which you'll do the first time round), it's the same game every time you play it, you're doing a lot of repetitive scenes (just faster each time) so it's just the same experience.  The app is therefore more like an interactive Youtube clip that you'll download from your cloud from time to time to share with others, rather than keep on your device taking up space as your simply not going to come back and play it on a frequent basis.
0316219266|5.0|I've actually bought and read this book which I've noticed that since Mackenzie and the amazon people began their aggressive campaign against Stone, many of the reviewers (especially the one-star ones) have not. You can see that I'm a verified purchaser.<br /><br />Mackenzie Bezos claims this book is not accurate in her review. But she really only gives one example and a very trivial one at that: about when Bezos did or did not read a certain book that may or may not have colored his thinking about amazon as a startup. Think about it for a second: that is an incredibly minor detail. The Everything Store is a nearly 400 page book. If that's all that the amazon people can home in on as Stone having gotten wrong, then it actually indicates what an incredibly strong job Stone has done and how accurate this book is. The rest of the criticism Mackenzie gives is about tone and interpretation, not facts. She doesn't like Stone's understanding and writing about what he was told. But Mackenzie herself wasn't present for those interviews. She has no direct knowledge herself as to whether Stone is accurately portraying them or not. There's no reason in the world to take her word for it.<br /><br />Brad Stone is technology and business reporter with a sterling reputation and impeccable credentials. He's held major reporting positions at Newsweek, The New York Times, and now Business Week. He literally been covering amazon and other tech companies for 20 years. He has high level contacts throughout the tech industry.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know or understand, having never run or worked for a major corporation, let me explain to you that what's actually going on here is a coordinated campaign against Stone. Don't for a minute think this was a spontaneous review by Mackenzie all by her lonesome, curled up with her laptop in bed with a good cup of tea. I guarantee you that behind the scenes Bezos and the amazon PR machine made decisions about how to tackle this book.First, they waited to see if it just flopped and they could ignore it. Once it zoomed up best-seller lists, they decided that they would have the wife post a \\"review\\" which they then made sure the media became aware of. I'll be you anything that Mackenzie's \\"personal review\\" was in fact poured over by Jeff and others at amazon, all carefully crafted for content, tone, etc. In turn, they also carefully backed it up with a Corporate PR press release castigating Stone that was ready to go the moment she posted her review. There will probably be a next wave if this one fails.<br /><br />The fact that Bezos doesn't like and doesn't want you to read this book should tell you everything you need to know about how good and accurate it is. It's not Stone's job to act as a PR member of amazon. Wake up and recognize when you're being played by the billion dollar corporate machine. Better yet, buy this book and decide for yourself. It's a great read by a top reporter. You won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you. I love the challenges and occassional accomplishments! :) This is a great game if you want a quick play - in and out - then carry on with your daily activities until you have more lives to play again!
B009ZM74F8|5.0|One of my favorite Christian Bale movies! I have watched this at least 10 times.  A lot of my friends haven't heard of it so I always loan it out or watch it with them.  Love it!
1596177373|4.0|Got these for my kid for Christmas. She's going to love them because she likes Tim Burton's movies her fave is Nightmare Before Christmas! Can't wait to give them to her!
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|I was torn between either a 3 star or 5 star rating and took the coward's way out to give it a 4 star. This was a well written novel with an excellent plot but over-long. To me, the constant changing of storyline and time period, particularly early in the book, was somewhat confusing - but maybe I'm getting old! Overall this was a good read and recommended.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. I love drama love stories. I would recommend to anyone who likes that kind if book.
B001F6TXME|5.0|really super great duper great happ mood too many words required to review these sill postings makes me want to not do it
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|one of my personnel favorite collections! 2 for 1 a must for all WALKING DEAD FANS. very well made great detailing great price,
0375842209|5.0|really super great duper great happ mood too many words required to review these sill postings makes me want to not do it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait for the movie and the mockingjay movies that was not at all what I expected it was way better!!!!
0061992860|5.0|For the price you can't go wrong. The concepts covered in the book would be invaluable in an extended survival situation. The book is smaller than I expected, fits in your hand perfectly. I would like if they would release region specific versions of this book. For example, I would not need to know useful plants that are only native to Europe. If you need something to throw into a bug out bag this is small, compact, and well worth the space.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this application :)...........it's the reason I give it a five star. Are you happy now!, tree more words required....
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Elizabeth is the star of this book in my opinion....She made up her mind to be a mother and love Victoria no matter what.  That she had misgivings about how that should be structured and miss the adoption court date is normal.. a lesson leArned would have been for Meridith to meet with both Victoria and Elizabeth prior to the important date to allay any fears on either part.  It would have circumvented the tragedy and had a better outcome.<br />The missing information was how baby Hazel got her birth date and name registered with an absent mother.  No small feat in today's world.<br />I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others. I can never look at a flower n the same way Again.
0062255657|5.0|I adore this book. The writing is so strongly conveyed that I felt literally transported into the shoes of the main character. If your looking for a charming and fun story full of magic and adventure then this is the story for you.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game can be fun but I do not like how the levels are designed.  The levels rely more on luck than skill as they are randomly recreated when you lose a life.  Most of the time it makes the game almost impossible to beat, unless you use a power-up to even the difficulty a little.  It's a shame the power-ups can be up to $3.99.  If you don't mind waiting and losing quite often the game is playable.  It also helps that so many people seem to play it and will send you lives which you can store in your notifications until you need them.  I'm sure the more impatient (often younger) players will spend money in order to progress.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I did not see the major twist in the movie coming. Can't say more. If you like supernatural horror, watch this!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Unusual and very enjoyable tale. Borrowed book #2 which continues the story. Am glad I decided to read it. Not disappointed.
B000255LNE|5.0|I'm wearing it out already, I love Phil Collins music. This is my favorite CD of all the ones he made
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Still reading but enjoy it so far. I like it because it kind of picks up where &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; (great story) left off.  I can  picture MM as Jake Brigance in this one also if it was ever made into a<br />movie.  Hope it is.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Loved every minute of this book. Captured me right off. Characters came alive. I will miss them. Every twist and turn had me waiting more. I love bookstores and wish to climb the ladder at Penumbra's!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I wanted to try angry bird because everybody were talking about it and was not disappointed, a lot of games (for free!) and levels, and very entertaining. I can play for hours!
B00CHILW64|5.0|A thrill and cringe a second, especially knowing it is based on a true story! I only wish there was some sort of follow up on what the family is doing now.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I actually did not think it would be so useful as I had the non rotating one. But if you watch several series/moviesvideos from various sources/apps, it helps watching them and have the support whatever the app's sense is, and you can always use the charger while watching. Finally very usefull and I do not use the previous one any longer!
B005UG542S|3.0|Not quite as dark as Deathly Hallows part 1, but this is not a childrens story.  Teens can handle it but it is far to dark for a young audience.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|This item was really ok, until I found the rotating one and then I had to abandon this one because I watch a lot of videos/series and prefer the rotating one. However, to use as a book or  only cover etc, it is still very useful.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Brings the old hip hop feel back to me. Beats and lyrical! No one can copy his style or keep up. The whole thing is hip hop touching every type of beat that many cannot keep their hiphop style on. This album is RAW, REAL, AND CREATIVE! The only thing that can come close to compare is Ems old albums but he crashed himself with this one. Just like old school hip hop, it makes you want to stay up all night and jam the new lyrics over and over again. Em is his own competition and there are many artist I know with talent but Em lives his every word if you move passed the rhymes and and understand his knowledge on why he use the words he use. Rhyme or Reason will let you know. Look up Em's lyrics on rapgenius.com and it will break down his or another artist lyrics from the history of the words and comparison to pass works. Then you'll understand why he and others choose their words in rap.
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|Really great to watch French TV gratis. A lot of various channels, and really live (French time)!!<br />That's how I watch the news, live on BFM, France 2, France 3 and some series/other things in French.<br />Really love this app to keep contact with France.<br />Would be awesome with more channels, but they anyway constantly update, so it is already fine!

B009LDD1X0|5.0|Big Bang has been our favorite sitcom since it premiered and I have to say that while most shows start to age after about 5 seasons, the addition of Bernadette and Amy freshened the format. This Sixth Season is my favorite to date.
0385350864|3.0|For anyone who read the serialised third storyline in the Independent: confusingly, none of this happened, which is too bad.  It took me a bit to realize that narrative was completely missing and was not going to be touched upon.  I kept waiting for an explanation - after all, it's still been well over a decade in Bridget's life, it might have been acknowledged - but, no.<br /><br />Enjoyed visiting with Bridget again, in her familiar voice, slightly tiringly updated by use of twitter and hashtags (but not a blog, oddly). I laughed out loud a few times.  Wish that at age 51 she'd be over thinking weight gain of 2 lbs is a tragedy, but it seems that Bridget does not mature, she just ages - much attention is devoted to fine lines and appearances and age consciousness, but she hasn't processed any life lessons.
0670026638|5.0|The great Russian writer Nikolai Gogol once asserted, \\"Nothing can be more powerful than an impression made on a person by the perfectly coordinated unity of all parts.\\"  That is just what Ozeki achieves in this gem of a novel, intelligently and movingly rendered.  It is a thought-provoking narrative with an unforgettable, rich theme (Salvation?) which she explores by taking the sweep of our shared -often cruel- humanity and de-constructing it right down to its most intimate -and life-afirming- details.  She shows mastery in detail, in voice, in the pairing of characters.  The only weak point, for me, is when the character of Ruth tries to explain everything that is going on in terms of quantum mechanics; the voice of the author becomes confounded with that of the character and the reader senses the uncertainty; but the overall architecture of the novel is so solid that any weakness is easily contained, supported by the rest of the fantastic achievement of this unforgettable work of art.  I have yet to read this year's winner of the Booker Prize, therefore am unable to make comparisons, but I cannot but expect that Ms. Ozeki was nothing less than a close, strong contender.  Overall remarkable!
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|For some reason unknown to me I was charged for the HD movie Pacific Rim twice. Once for the regular movie at $3.99 and once for the HD version at $4.99.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|What a disappointment!!  If you know anything about late 20th century,  you would conclude that Maggie Thatcher was a towering figure in shaping the cold war history.  Even a heroic figure to many who lived under Eastern Europe's communist dictatorship!<br /><br />How can you call this movie as her 'biography'?<br /><br />It is absolutely clear that this movie is made by someone who hates Ms Thatcher.  The camera takes a joy, an utter delight in showing her suffering as an old, decrepit, confused person.  THAT is what the movie wants to impress the viewers on!  Whenever there is a brief segment about her triumph as a politician or as a powerful woman,  the movie always, and IMMEDIATELY, goes back to  Thatcher as an ill and  lonely old pensioner!  Even the cover photo of  Thatcher looks very unflattering.  Why didn't the movie makers use the picture of her as old pensioner staggering along a lonely, cold street as the cover?  That would have been more representative of this movie!!!<br /><br />In summary, new generation of young people may ask,  'Who is the 'Iron Lady'?  Why is she call that?'.  The movie quickly answers, 'Oh, she is nobody.  She is an old, decrepit, demented pensioner who sometimes has these wild flashbacks of delusion about her past'.<br /><br />And you call this a biopic?  Just horrible.  Absolutely horrible.<br /><br />The fact that Meryl Streep took the main role in this movie tells me that she IS the deluded fool about the cold war history.  I hope someone with less  personal hatred in his or her  heart can do some justice to the great life of Baroness Maggie Thatcher.

B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Like her voice and sound, but Royals is not her best work and it doesn't accurately reflect the album as a whole. However, some of this is simply because I no longer relate to the experiences of 16 year olds. Best song - Glory and Gore - hands down!

B00B8R1NP0|3.0|This story, like so many others was poorly plotted, ignored modern day forensics, and based it's success on sensationalism rather than suspense and intrigue true mysteries are built on. I gave it a tongue in cheek three stars after pondering whether it really rated two. Todd seems to have the skills necessary to write true mysteries but he has to get away from far fetched grisly murders, predictably one after the other, while disregarding clues that would surely have shown up at least at one or more of the crime scenes he created. For me, any good story has to have

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The chromecast has been a good addition to our home.  Setup was really easy to do and follow.  It works great streaming netflix and youtube videos from any computer in the house.  I love being able to use streaming music stations as well to send music to my sound system using any device that has the chrome browser.  One issue that I have run into and should note is that when using other video streaming services the video stream can stutter and is not as clear as netflix and youtube.  This is more of an issue when trying to push the video from a wireless connected device.  It seems this is a problem with my wireless network not having enough room or bandwidth to play video using a wireless connection from the internet to my computer and then using the same wireless connection stream it to the chromecast which can only be used with a wireless connection.  A computer wired to the internet and then pushing video to the chromecast using the wireless connection smooths out most of these issues.  Overall for the money you can't go wrong.

B009NY43NY|3.0|The end of the Southern Vampire series was not the best of the series sadly. It lacked the witty humor that I enjoyed so much in the earlier books. After the last book (which was a total dud!) I had higher expectations for this one but the spark was gone.

B00EL8I8IS|4.0|If you went into this thinking this was going to be an adaptation from the book and didn't hear any news about this not being a direct book conversion that was discussed 6 months prior to the film's release, either:<br /><br />1) You are a nitwit.<br />2) You are just trolling.<br />3) Or you have been living in a cave for an entire year reading nothing but World War Z and the one time you emerge is to go to the movies and say &#34;WTF?&#34;<br /><br />That said, for an action zombie flick it worked and was fun. That's all you can ask for from something that went through so much turmoil getting made.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this book and thought I would get done rather quickly. Nope. It was a slow progression into disaster. I am giving it 3 stars because it had a clear climax, ending and closed up a majority of the questions so the reader is not left hanging and wondering what happened to whoever, or whatever. Am I pissed, hell yeah I a pissed. What author in their right mind kills off that many main characters? I mean really! REALLY! ( I will say that Game of Thrones does an excellent job of killing of main characters meaningfully) This is not Game of Thrones. You need these people in these books. I was so excited and this fell completely short. Still well written, but there was too much jumping back and forth...Tris, Tobias, Tris, Tobias.....I was pulling my hair out trying to remember whose mind I was in and had to re-read some parts to confirm.<br /><br />Furthermore, I am all for inclusion in everything, including writing, but is it me or does it seem like the author tried too hard to put a gay couple in the mix. I feel like it came out of the blue and did nothing to help the story line at all. I almost feel like it was created because there is a movie coming out, and it would make a great scene for the 3rd movie ( Although this book would need a lot of work to make it a script, unlike the other 2 books) It was torture to get through this and I am glad it is over. Generally, I like to leave a series with a collective sigh, and feeling whole on the sense of the way it ended but this was not it. Hmm let me see 2 1/2 years seems like a great place to give people updates about folks, lets write about that.<br /><br />I truly did love the characters in this series. They were well thought out and had layers. I also enjoyed that family played a big role in the decisions that were made as well. I would like the writer to take the Truth Serum and tell us what was she was really thinking about while writing this last book because the end seemed to rush in, and the beginning seemed slow like she was not sure where to go. 3.5 Starse end seemed to rush in, and the beginning seemed slow like she was not sure where to go. 3.5 Stars
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book for my 11 year old nephew based on some of the reviews here.  He told me he really enjoyed it, and rated it 10/10.  He loaned me the book, and after reading it myself, I would have to agree.  I won't rehash the plot, but suffice it to say the story is ultimately about friendship and triumph over adversity.  If you're even a little bit sentimental, you better have some tissues handy.  It's also funny at times and very uplifting.  After reading the book, it really makes you think about the value of kindness to others, especially to those less fortunate.<br /><br />Although this book is aimed towards a young audience, I would recommend it for anyone from 10-adult.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|my only dislike is having to wait so long after I lose to play again. but the gameplay itself is fun and addictive.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Many details, which at times are hard to wade through, but a great book if you want to read about Jesus' life as a man.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Well written.  Interesting perspective as a non-violent offender seeing prison life as a person who isn't exactly a seasoned offender.<br />I think men, myself included, can get a real taste of life in a women's penal system.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|Inspired by a famous fairy tale, Catherine Hardwicke’s “Red Riding Hood” follows the story of Valerie (Amanda Seyfried), a young woman living in a medieval village haunted by a werewolf. An allusion to the tale of Little Red Riding Hood is, however, rendered pointless because of the uninteresting heroine and even more uninteresting (and confusing) story that goes on and on without knowing where it is going.<br /><br />Valerie has a childhood friend Peter. Peter and Valerie love each other and decide to run away from the dull community they live in, when a tragic death happens. Hunting begins.<br /><br />The film feels rushed. Things happen too quickly, without letting us know the characters. It seems filmmakers do not know what they are trying to make. As a horror or thriller, “Red Riding Hood” is not very thrilling; as a romance it is not very romantic.<br /><br />Only Gary Oldman as Father Solmon determined to hunt down the werewolf seems to know what kind of film he is in. He refuses to take the film too seriously, as his almost over-the-top performance shows. Oldman’s character and his story about his wife and two daughters is more interesting than the entire film, an empty retelling of a classic fairy tale.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|Bob Dylan The Complete Albums Collection. Every album is here. The new remastered discs sound excellent. The book that is included is very interesting. There are also a few things that are not so great. Seeing as how Volume 2 will be the Bootleg Series, it makes absolutely no sense why Volume 1 and the Side Tracks discs would be incomplete of so many essential tracks. I understand that some tracks can't be licensed due to the fact that they come from soundtracks, but that doesn't explain why several official Dylan penned Columbia singles/B-sides/rarities such as, \\"George Jackson (Band Version)\\" \\"Rita May\\", \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues (Live)\\", \\"Corrina, Corrina (Electric Version)\\", \\"Spanish Is The Loving Tongue (Piano Version)\\", \\"People Get Ready\\", \\"Never Let Me Go\\" or the Mark Ronson remix of \\"Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)\\" are not included. Other than that, this is a great collection at a great value.  Also, as others have mentioned, skip the USB version, as the resolution is 16 bit and identical to the CD set.
B00DWFQ2N4|2.0|I enjoyed the first release so much that this was a let down.  Many of the songs are simply a beat and one major line for a lyric.  It was a mistake for me to buy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive, challenging and unbelievably fun. This game trains my brain to look for patterns and make quick decisions but it's also my wonderful guilty pleasure.
1250012570|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book. Rainbow gets teenage love exactly right. There's not too much angst or drama - Eleanor and Park are REAL. Both of them are misfits in their own way. Eleanor is chubby, doesn't dress the \\"right\\" way and comes from a troubled family. Park is half-Asian is in a basically all-white part of town. They gradually connect with one another on the bus rides to and from school, over music and comic books.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever read a more authentic portrayal of high school. I felt like I was back in high school myself while I was reading it. I wish I could have been friends with Eleanor and Park back then.<br /><br />You may have heard that some parents in Minnesota tried to ban this book from their kids' school district. These people must be dead inside. Also, their main concern with the use of the \\"f-word\\" in the book. If your kid hasn't heard that word by the time they hit high school, you should consider unchaining them from the chair in the locked room you keep them in.<br /><br />I know this review is super gushy but this book deserves it. Love, love, love!
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Great songs and I love the overall sound. But what the heck is up with \\"Saved By Love\\"? I'm pretty sure that's not the whole song.. :( .However, I am pleasantly suprised by the rest of the album. Face melting solos galore.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|No holds barred lawyering. Spoiler alert! Things that have been simmering for several seasons really hit the boiling point. You may be able to guess what they are.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|I first heard of Gary Clark Jr due to very frequent, persistent but never tiring promoting of said artist by Epiphone. Clark uses Epiphone Archtop guitars and due to his sucess Epiphone has plastered him all over their newsletters. I am glad they did. I sampled his work by purchasing the Bright Lights E.P. and liked his sound quite alot. After that, I got my hands on the Gary Clark E.P., which featured some more great songs. Finally I got my hands on Blak And Blu and was very excited by my purchase. However, my initial reaction to the album was not very positive. There were alot of songs that were vastly inferior to what I had heard and expected of this musician. After repeated listenings I realized that there is some really great material recorded here, but that suprisingly are drowwned ou towards the end of the album, while some of the worst songs are placed in front and center. &#34;Blak and Blu&#34;, &#34;The Life&#34; and &#34;Travis County&#34; - the worst songs of the album that merited at best to be featured as bonus tracks - are placed in the begginning of the album. So the tracklisting is the first issue I have with this album as it may deter people from buying it if they stick to listening to the first 6 tracks.<br />My other problem were that the recorded version of the songs &#34;Please Come Home&#34; and &#34;Things Are Changin&#34; on this album are vastly inferior to the ones available on Clark's previous E.P's due to overproduction. Their live and underproduced previously recorded versions are alot better. That's my second issue with this album.<br />And in comes my third issue. I have bought the deluxe version with two added bonus tracks ( Breakdown&#34; and &#34;Soul&#34;) which are really good songs that merited to be included on the main album and should have replaced &#34;Blak and Blu&#34;, &#34;The Life&#34; and &#34;Travis County&#34; which are far inferior. I also do not understand as to why they did not include &#34;I Don't Owe You A Thang&#34;. The album has plentuy of recycled tracks from previous releases, what harm could there be in adding another? I can only suppose it aims to pushthe consummer into purchasing the &#34;Bright Lights E.P.&#34;.<br />So essentially it's a very good album, with excellent songs that grow even more on you as you listen to them, but the album is severly marred by it's somewhat inept and detracting tracklisting. Be prepared to hit the skip button on ocasion but even if you don't buy the bonus tracks version (which I would if I were you as it's two bonus tracks are well worth the few extra bucks) there will still be alot of great songs to go through even after skipping a few of them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I have read it three times.  Purchase immediately and get ready for a great love story.
B000HKYNQ0|2.0|This is not the enhanced version with the replaced space scenes and enhanced footage. It's nice to see the original but not the way it was advertised on the Amazon site.
0062255657|5.0|Nearly finished with Neil Gaiman's new book, Ocean at the End of the Lane. It is amazing how he weaves myth with reality, past with present, and memory with dream in his storytelling. The book has some pretty spiritual parts, and really taps into something deep. I am actually recalling parts of my own childhood because of this book. Aspects of the story reminds me of \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" by Madeleine L'Engle, other parts remind me of the stories from ancient Sanskrit.<br /><br />I think this would make an amazing Miyazaki style animated film. The descriptions of places, food, and memories were so vivid, the characters so warm or terrifying(depending on which one). Gaiman taps into some deeply moving archetypes with this book.<br /><br />As usual, Gaiman's narration in the audiobook is also superb.
B00FMFEA68|5.0|I eagerly awaited the release of this book and it lived up to the anticipation. Autobiography is well written and perfectly in Morrissey's voice. You can hear him reading it.<br /><br />The beginning is utterly poetic. It's great to hear additional details of his upbringing and family tree. There are many stories not previously shared.<br /><br />Morrissey lets your foot in the door to his personal life, but it's only opened a crack. There are new details, but often these lead to more questions. As is a very Morrisseyish thing to do ;)<br /><br />Also this book is very funny! So many classic lines! Believe me there are many people who do not get off easy and are subject to classic Morrissey zingers.<br /><br />Start reading it and really just try to stop! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game it's like Temple run but cooler.I like how you could get characters and I like how they are on a tour and when they change countries they have a cool new character. ^U^
B00BD99JMW|5.0|****Spoilers below****<br /><br />I love that Veronica Roth was bold enough to end this book in a way that shocked readers. I could not have predicted the ending to this series. I have to say, the Tris that I had grown to know throughout this series would not have allowed Caleb to go through with the task he volunteered for. So if anything, Roth stayed true to her characters. I admire and respect that. Not every story ends in a warm and fuzzy way. This story ended with strength, boldness, and in a way that backed up the characters she'd been developing for the last 2 novels. Some readers are giving this story a poor rating because they wished it had ended wrapped up in bows - but that's not the way this story was meant to end. In the end, there is still hope and new life; new beginnings and moving forward. I loved this book and I hate that Roth isn't getting the credit she deserves.

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Em has delivered one great album after another (with the exception of Encore), but with The Marshall Mathers LP 2 he has clearly returned to that dark, anger-fueled state he was in when formulating the original MMLP and The Eminem Show during the early 2000s.  Whether he is rapping about his fatherless childhood, being misunderstood/labeled, people who have come in and out of his life, apologizing to his mother or revisiting the awesomely sick humor of his earlier days, Em spits fire in amazing ways over all 21 tracks of this album.  Very, very good - a must-have for any Eminem fan.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A story told by Death himself. About a young German girl who stole books and some how survived WWII. The words saved her. They helped carry her through the loss of everyone and everything she loved. It is a story about horror, about family and finally it is filled with hope.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|It's difficult to start reviewing this piece of pulp fiction. To begin at the beginning, perhaps Seth was hung; if so, either genetics or an act of God created the adjective. I wonder if the word choice is Grisham's linguistic joke. At any rate, the fact that the protagonist of sorts was HANGED, by himself, no less, strains credulity, since said hangee had a pocket full of drugs sufficient to take him to the great beyond, out of his pain, without the concomitant querying.<br /><br />But Seth's having been either hung or hanged, or both, begs the query, \\"why\\"? From the get-go, only two answers are logical: either a Mississippi lynchin' or a bastard mulatto would cause a rich old white eccentric Southern man to choose such a \\"redemptive\\" ending.<br /><br />Either way, family bushes must be thrashed to get to the heart of the matter. And thrashed the bushes are. In one of the more comical pieces of dialog, the reader is informed that \\"she was born when she was sixteen\\". That's quite a feat. I think that the writer was trying to say that the sympathetic Letty, the black maid who is the beneficiary of the white man's handwritten will, had a hard life that somehow the white employer caused. Regardless of improper pronouns, the reader must thrash through the family bushes, and ultimately winds up with a bad case of poison ivy.<br /><br />Additionally the resurrection of characters and plot from \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Last Juror\\" is tiresome. Yoknapatawpha County this setting is not, and Grisham certainly is not Faulkner.<br /><br />Even as a writer of pulp fiction, Grisham seems to be running out of re-runs.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|The story should have stayed in Chicago. I agree with the other reviewers especially with the Trueman referance. The &#34;labeling&#34; and &#34;profiling&#34; got old really fast, I needed to put my kindle down. OK, we get it. Point made. The Tris and Tobias intervals did not work for me. Roth went down the beaten path on this one.  Should there be a movie, I won't be watching. The last book was no where near as interesting as the first two.

B0001I55OC|5.0|I never read the book, and I have to say. The movie really isn't that bad, when you consider the plot of the book, and with the french and the english duking it out. So, for all you purists. Give it a rest, granted, some of Clive Cussler's books have been butchered. But that was due to just pathetic writing, and bad casting all the way around. I will say that Paul Walker is a terrible actor, and brings the movie down a bit. THE rest of the actors do a pretty good job, a group of archeology students are sent back in time. To search for paul walker's character's father, the movie doesn't try to be anything other than what it is. An indiana Jones type action movie, I highly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|could not put it down. really well written. very original story and the different character's story lines are expertly woven together.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I like the concept of the movie, good effects but the acting is lacking....I really like Will Smith in other movies but on this one not. In my personal opinion, I can only describe his acting as 'robotic'....
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After investing your time and energy and money into a trilogy you should come away with something. Well all this trilogy leaves you with is devastating loss. Through 3 books we root for Tris to be brave and strong and we want her to have her happily ever after. But we don't get that here! I would not recommend these books and I will not be seeing them when they are made into movies.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  It can be very challenging but fun.  The more friends you have the better.  It's great helping one another.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Even the smallest and I am a bit like to have the same way that is a good thing about it will take you can also find that you have a bit of an excellent opportunity and a half
B00GBCMW9S|1.0|I spent $16 on this album and it wont play. I wrote customer service and they never responded. Guess I'm just out the money and worst of all still no eminent!
B005IDXIL2|2.0|I like PBA myself. Much better. I deleted this soon after downloading it. It's fun for kids, but us adults need something more challenging .
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I was thrilled to know that Candy Crush is now available for Kindle. Unfortunately, I'm not residing in the US and don't have a US address for my credit card to be able to download the app..tsk tsk..
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone in a relationship, it's helps to figure out what our spouse needs but don't know how to say
B00DJZR46G|5.0|i'm a big fan of Elton John's music and this album is very good. there are a number of songs on it that i like very much. if you like Elton John's music, i recommend this album.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book...not just the ending but the whole thing.  I didn't like the narratives switching each chapter but I could live with it.  The whole book seems like it was written just to kill off Tris.  None of the core characters grew.  I kept asking myself why Peter and Christina were even in the book.  They added nothing to this story but were interesting characters before.  And Tobias regressed into a whiny character who Tris would not have been interested in at all. Such a shame...it could have been so much better!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I love Dick Van Dyke.  He is my favorite Disney leading man! My daughter loves the songs.  So everybody is happy!
B00DZJ82W6|4.0|I was never too happy with the sound of the original \\"Moondance\\" CD. Buying the remastered LP a year or so ago helped me rediscover the album. This new multi-disc set is beautifully packaged in a cloth bound album, includes many outtakes and alternate versions which are interesting & enjoyable, including the studio chatter which allows you to hear the album coming together back in 1969. Liner notes are good and I especially enjoyed the recollections of Elliot Scheiner, one of several engineers who worked on the original (his 5.1 channel audio is included here on a Blu-ray). No lyrics, though.<br /><br />This set also includes the first audio Blu-Ray disc I've ever really liked. Most Blu-Ray discs take a few seconds to be read by the player, then the listener/viewer must sit through a 10 to 15 second logo and finally choose the audio format from a menu. The \\"Moondance\\" disc simply gets up and running all by itself, almost as quickly as a CD or SACD.<br /><br />Sound quality is very good, but there are limits. Each instrument was recorded monophonically onto a master with 8 tracks. Elliot's placement of instruments is tasteful without being boring. Van's vocal is up front and center of course, as are the drums which were not recorded in stereo.  The listening experience is hugely enjoyable anyway and I doubt I'll listen to \\"Moondance\\" in 2-channel stereo very often.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really do love this show. You get to know all the characters and i never cry at shows or movies and found myself tearing up at parts...you'll see. I like that that its a little different since the house and staff story lines are separated but also intertwined. Can't wait for next season so I can find out what happened since it left off with a cliff hanger..
0066620996|5.0|Excellent book - an eye opening read.  Very meaningful case studies are used to illustrate the main points of the author's thesis.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was an excellent gift for son for his birthday. Minecraft is his most favorite game at the moment. Russ
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is great and fun Its so fun I think it's great I recommend this  fun game great fun game to all. Don't miss out on this game it's fun and yea it's also great. Get it. :D fun fun fun fun fun fun great.
1449410243|5.0|this was a gift for my daughter. she loves cats and this book was perfect for her. she read it quickly
B0036TGT3E|5.0|classic movie that looks nice and they had the decency to have the version without the morning report song tacked in
0060751967|5.0|LOVE the Argeneau series! This book delivers as well as any of them in the series! A very fun read!
B008UWEFU6|5.0|It is unexplainable why I love these books. I have recommended them to all of my friends. I hope the movie is as good as the books..
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Started out slow but as it picked up, I was wondering what in the world the Secret could be, and it was not at all what I thought but it kept me wondering.  I couldn't wait until I knew how all the people fit into the story.  I couldn't it put down.  I thought it was very intriguing and well written and the ending was, after reading it thru, was perfect.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very nice but it take some time to load. Also when you kill an animal the bullet takes to long to hit the animal overall it's a pretty nice game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game, but it is too hard to complete some levels and you have to stay on them too long.
1452115567|4.0|I enjoyed the pictures and the commentary. I do wish the photograph of Maddie in her ghost costume had been included in the book. The author/photographer did a great job. Very enjoyable.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Awesome movie to watch.  Especially with surround sound.  I have already watched it 5 times.  Plan on watching it again
034580404X|5.0|Interesting reading, couldn't put it down.  Who would not love Christian Grey???  I read it 3 times and each time I found that I must have missed something first go round
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|awesome for my collection.  I have always watched this movie growing up as a child. This will be a treasure.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This book was light and dark without bringing you down.  The mystery was fun and entertaining. I liked the characters and how each brought a unique perspective.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|I learned of the book watching ancient aliens<br />Everyone should read it<br />The first book I've stuck with till the end in years
B00AXVIBKW|4.0|If you're already a Bad Religion fan, just get it and you won't be disappointed. If you are just getting into their music, this would not be the album to start with as it doesn't have the same impact as most of their previous works.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Early gift buying for my granddaughter's birthday, By the time December hits, selection in stores is slim, so this was fantastic! She loves monster high, and she loves cats, and this is a new doll this year, very happy I got it for her! Very cute, reasonably priced, and very fast shipping!
B000002KXV|5.0|Brilliant, from one half of the duo that is Steely Dan.  These songs are somewhat like the songs of Steely Dan, but with a straightforward, unabashedly romantic sensibility; sweet without being too sweet; openly affectionate, longing, hoping; showing vulnerability but without using it as a manipulative ploy; lacking Steely Dan's sour jaded cynicism and perverse outlook.  Clever, playful, humorous, knowing, mature ...<br />Musically delectable; nuanced, cultivated, jazzy, layered, complex, etc., yet full of vitality, passion, life, etc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good game and my family loves to play it with each other.<br />Would definitely recommend it to play with each other and my family loves the game a lot.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting is one of my favorite musicians, and I love the stories he can tell through his music!  I would love to see this on stage.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It is okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Animation was good in most of the show.  Just about what you would expect.
1451666179|4.0|Soooo happy to have this book :D<br /><br />Devoured the contents alternately laughing and crying. Part way through, I realized I was disturbing the toddler with so much laughcry and hid my face in the book for a minute. It was dark in there, and quiet, and moms don't get a lot of privacy so I closed my eyes and accepted the next five minutes for what they were. Book faced. Then finished the book! I was begged to re-read The God of Cake to my six year old several times (only had to edit out one word yay)but this is normal, kids like repetition. Toddlers don't like repetition, they LIVE repetition. An entire story is too long for a toddler, he will allow one page exactly.(spoiler!)Page 346 has circles on it. Circles and triangles! I am not allowed to look at any other page with toddler in room. Book is currently propped up with 346 on display. Because circles and triangles, you guys!<br /><br />So I read the book, I humored the kids, I had guests over, I ate an avocado --- When do you think I discovered the ink on my forehead that looks like I've been beaten and bruised? shortly after the avocado. Because of the handwashing. I'm not an avocado eating animal over here. The hands must be washed! And there is a mirror above the sink. sigh.<br /><br />Pro - one page will delight your children for hours!<br />Con - one teary nap will cause unscrubbable bruises that make your guests feel awkward.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Great action!  Just a little predictable. Would still recommend to watch for sure.  Helps to see the first one before the sequel.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Pretty good game except for the &quot;pay as you go&quot; aspect of this&quot;free&quot; game. They limit the number of hunts per day, put a time delay on some upgrades, and make some weapons ridiculously expensive so you either have to be really patient while you earn points with inadequate weapons, or pay money to get what you need.  I'd rather pay up front for a fully functional game than get &quot;nickle and dimed&quot; like this.<br /><br />Otherwise, the graphics are great on a Kindle Fire HD, and game play is excellent.
B0009UC810|5.0|Still irreverent, stylish, self-assured and riotously funny after all this time. Belushi and Aykroyd live and breathe the roles of Jake and Elwood, the buttoned-down, stern-faced suits who suddenly explode when the stage lights fire up, characters who seemed instantly destined to transcend the spectacle of their own story. Their plot is, really, embarrassingly simple - regroup the band, put on a big show, save the orphanage - but the strength of the brothers, the ad-lib mastery of their vessels and a staggering wealth of guest appearances mold it into a behemoth that's barely able to squeeze into a comfortable running time. It may seem random, zany and baffling at times, but it's impossible to look away and eventually everything comes together in a loud, reckless, picture-perfect finale. Viewed in a modern setting, it doubles as a fascinating glimpse at city life in the twilight of the 70s - especially when the boys lead pursuing police on a frenzied high-speed chase through the heart of a bustling shopping mall. Classic stuff.
B00D4ABW82|5.0|We Came As Romans puts out another hard rocking album that completely kicks butt. You plan on working out and need some motivational music to step up your routine? Take this with you and that will give you the boost you're looking for. Listened to it 3 times so far and still not tired of it.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I use it regularly and it is good for someone like me with a bad memory.  It syncs easily with my Android phone and my Ipad.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very easy way to pass the time. If you have any time to spare, this would be a great way to let it pass. With many cool items added in the update, this made a great game even better. Highly recommended that you get this app.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and have really enjoyed this Harry Bosch series. I have one left in this series to read and I hate to see them come to an end. If you like a good mystery you will enjoy these.
B001POX73C|5.0|Oh what fun! I found myself giggling and outwardly laughing a couple of times reading the dialogue in this story. I literally moaned a loud &#34;No!&#34; when I found out I was at the end of the book, finding instead that there was nothing there but the &#34;About the Author&#34; page. This book has a lot of funny, lovely, charming characters, best of all our hero: the Honourable Freddy Standen. I love Freddy! He is a great Beta hero-- not too handsome, certainly not the smartest of men but he is absolutely fashionable and incredibly practical. I've read this book 4 times now since I first read it in August, I even bought the two audiobooks (one abridged, the other unabridged). If you want to try historical fiction, or Georgette Heyer or just want to read a light, fun escapist literature, go ahead and venture into 1816 England and meet Freddy and Kitty in Cotillion!
B00288KNJU|5.0|I don't understand why the industry sells blu-ray and dvd combo packs.... and it's frustrating to try and find JUST blu-rays, but the movie is awesome!  The graphics are incredible.  The storyline is cute and the effects are very imaginative!  :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Nice app with a very user friendly interface. Works reliably and smoothly with very few hiccups.  I love this app.
B000002AGY|5.0|This Legacy pressing from 1997 is by far the finest sounding cd version of this classic. Only thing close is the original vinyl from 1975 on CTI. And even then, I would lean on the Legacy pressing because it is so clean on the quiet passages like the title track sound dreamy.
0307891372|4.0|This is a tall order because of the scale of the game itself. As I went through this guide, I felt like the editors had to make decisions that were difficult because of the nature of the game. I feel like Prima tends to spend more attention to detail in general and produces nicely polished guides. This one is no exception. I feel like this is necessary as you play Skyrim, because the in-game maps are poor. I recommend this guide.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote! I use it for my party planning business and it keeps me organized. I use it on my laptop,  Kindle and cell phone.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Definitely worth it for the HERO2 if you are planning on using it underwater.  The camera focus much better than the original case.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Fun, quirky, well-written book.  Sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and sometimes poignant, it offered a fast, enjoyable read.  I'm proud of you Rose Gardner!
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The characters crated in this book are astounding in there detail and forethought each with rich depth and genuine well character.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|The movie was intense, so many unexpected turns.  I was on the edge of my seat!  The Main characters were fantastic!
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I saw the play & wanted to see the movie.  It is just a fun, happy movie.  It can't help but make you smile.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|It is a very fun game. Jundroo LLC is right, go buy Kerbal Space Program, but when you're on your phone, you should buy SimpleRockets.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it, but can you add all blocks from the pc version? But minecarts,rails,mob spawning eggs,&amp; gamemode changing i would like that.
B00DYVU9K8|2.0|It was ok I enjoyed the first 20mins then got bored very quickly think they could have done there homework on the story but it is what it is if you can redbox do it i wouldnt buy it
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|This installment completely lacks the subtle humor and endearing characters of the first of this series.  There weren't any moments that brought a lump into my throat.
1781162646|4.0|Great mystery with a &#34;touch&#34; of King's supernatural.  Keeps you guessing. Enjoyed the characters as well as the storyline regarding carnivals.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|A variation on the  zombie movie theme, with better acting. The trailer is much more evocative than the movie itself...
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Hands down the most fun I have had playing a game. I can't put it down. I love the extra points for a lung shot!!!! You have to get this game!!
B00BF11UM0|3.0|The skinny, blond,'hollywood' protagonist is simply not believable as the hard nosed, determined, talented investigator. Can there ever be a 'non-hollywood' female star?
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Finished book number two, 50 shades darker, full of surprises. I am hooked. I have to know how this ends.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is so fun to play while relaxing in the evening, or while sitting in the passenger seat on a long drive. I would recommend it to anyone who would like a fun game to play on their kindle. Anyone can play this game and have a good time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works very well. My wife and kids love it as well.  Looking forward to more functionality but as is it was really worth the money.
B000TEUSJU|5.0|it was exactly as advertised!!! A!!!!! Arrived quickly....and was as stated!!!  Brand new and exactly as stated in the advertisement
B000J1AGQI|1.0|He uses a tragic period in US history to promote his very biased and narrow views of God & Country, Honor et cetera.<br />Were he not such a self aggrandizing self made martyr, this might have ranked with John Wayne's worst.<br />As it stands, this is trash and does no honor to the brothers who DID serve.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I am so excited that Justin can still turn out such good music!  His voice hasn't suffered much over the years, and what an interesting blend of musical forms.  To me, four of the first five songs are terrific, with great instrumentation, and haunting and memorable lyrics.  His &#34;On the Road to Love&#34; with Kenny Loggins is great!  Then we enter the country and western part of the album with some reworked old songs and a new one.  I like them a quite a bit, but many of his fans may not feel like me.  The last two songs, two renditions of Justin's &#34;I know you're out there somewhere&#34; are just strange.  Overall I love the album, and can repeat songs or skip songs as needed with the press of a button.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game for horse lovers.....great graphics...lots of different activities and mini games. I would definitely recommend this game..good fun....download this app.
B00BWQW73E|1.0|You just got another one star review, Mr. Stone. I do not find biographies valid when the author does not work with the person he is writing about, especially when the author publicly repudiates that person's wife.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows out there at the moment and it was a good price I couldn't miss out on!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love this series and I can't wait for the last and final book. I swear I never put the book sown! Loved it!
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Minna saiko, arigato, ka ka ka kawaii!  Anyone who doesn't like or get Avril's new album doesn't truly like or get her, it's perfect!  Anyone who disses the songs reminiscing about her youth, you're just jealous that she still looks exactly the same ten years later, and you definitely don't!  Anyone who disses the racier songs, just because you're not comfortable with your sexuality and she is (similarly to Xtina), that's your problem not hers!  Anyone who doesn't understand or appreciate why she included the two experimental wild card songs Bad Girl and Hello Kitty, doesn't understand or appreciate Avril!  And anyone who can't handle the swearing, please go back to the 1950's asap!  In all seriousness, between her perfect, angelic, crystal clear high notes, the subtle Cranberries influence and her adorable Canadian accent, nobody can deny this chick can wail!  My personal favorite track is You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet!  Meow!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|my daughter loved this movie when she was a child, and I know that my granddaughter will love it too!
B000003N7K|5.0|Stay home and let the club come to you a quiet night.<br />Enjoy John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman you are too beautiful and dedicated to you my love.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is sweet!!! Love it , lots of fun. Very good for kids to my 7 year old son loves it also.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has another hit on his hands.  This was a wonderful book to read.  I could hardly put it down.  The reader becomes so involved with the characters and the setting that you actually feel as if you have been transported into the book.  It also sheds light on a time in history that should never be forgotten
B00EDF43MY|1.0|Horrible over-priced, buggy and flawed software with developers who are money hungry, want educational apps? look else-where these are made for the less fortunate with no brains.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this bingo game the most!!! I play everyday enjoy trying to get items!<br />If you like bingo a must!!
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is wonderful!  We need more messages that uplift us and focus on what really matters.  Beauty and goodness come from within.  We can never judge anyone based on what we see on the outside.  What a meaningful and important message for us to embrace ourselves and one another for who we are.  &#34;Wonder&#34; what the world would be like if we were all like that?
0743289692|5.0|A very personal account of the hardships of a Muslim woman. Very impacting and eye opening. An educational read. I highly recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very well written if you like the first one you are going to be all into this one. And a special twist at the end woot woot
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Addicting series. Quick and fast read. Great for pre teens and young adults... And those who remember the turmoil of falling in love
B000TETD9Q|5.0|newly placed on my ipod.  This music helps me exercise more intensely and for a longer period of time.  I love the Beach Boys!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Looks great easy to read and use, will have fun with the music in the mornings, have been playing with the alarm all afternoon since I bought the app.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|It is a touching story of a teenager who stood up for girls' right to education in the face of mortal danger to her and her family. It is written with the clear conscience of a child. Although the events described agree with what one hears from the news media, it tells you what you don't often hear: about the resistance offered by ordinary people in spite of Taliban's reign of terror.  Although the book will enrage and sadden you, it will also up lift your spirits to learn about this child's heroism. I recommend this book especially for young readers.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Liking the movie version, I just had to actually read the book, after all these years. It was captivating and a most satisfying read. Highly recommended!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The numbers are bigger than the regular time that the kindle has and the alarms have choices; I couldn't ask for more.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Giant Robots fighting Giant Monsters!! A cinematic slug-fest with titanic special effects, over the top acting and just plain fun. Don't get much better than that and best not to expect more. Giant Robots fighting Giant Monsters!!
0670024856|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert’s The Signature of all Things has quite blown me away. Such a powerfully and beautifully rendered cast of characters, the amazing and riveting plot, the mind-boggling research rendered accessible to most any reader. I was drawn immediately into the book by Gilbert’s skill in rendering dialogue so strong that the characters emerge in all their brilliant color. At times I felt that I was tumbling from one story into another as Gilbert braids varied themes -- greed, power, botany, research and human longing into an historical novel told in a brilliant tapestry of color.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|never thought it would happen to me.. but damn this game is addicting! my 3 year old has no clue how to play but alwaus wants to match the special candies lol.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|This show makes me laugh out loud! I think the writing is brilliant and it's a fantastic ensemble cast. I bought all 4 seasons and will be getting the 5th as soon as it comes out.
1781162646|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Stephen King, and although this wasn't his best work, it was entertaining.  There is a lot of background into the 'carny' lifestyle that although not entirely true to life, is still fun to read/imagine.  I wish it was available on Kindle though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the most well thought out plots I've read in a long time.  Just when you think you have things figured out, a new surprize!  This book will have you guessing until the end.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie.  I couldnt wait until the dvd came out to buy it.  I want to watch it again  It was simple, sweet, funny, and I enjoyed the actors.  It may have been a bit over-dramaic, but I still enjoyed it.<br />the way I can tell I like a show or book is whether I would watch it again and pay for it.  I would this one.
B009AOFNU4|2.0|Doesn't work on Windows 7 well at all.  Failed driver support mentioned in the Steel Series product website, but doesn't seem important for them to fix.  Not detectable with bluetooth and only semi-functional with USB with software that only detects it once.  For it to work again, you have to remove the device and then add it again.<br /><br />I'll likely buy a cheaper usb only gamepad so that I'll have something that works until, maybe someday, they fix their software and device drivers.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|I purchased this set 4 year ago and found that a few of the discs did have some stuttering issues and the picture quality on a normal CRT TV via DVD was not bad, but it was also not great.  Late this year, I took the plunge and purchased a new HDTV, high end up converting DVD player, and new 5.1 sound to go with it.<br /><br />I have watched many other DVD's and found the more recent to be of better picture quality almost matching Blu Ray.  So far, I have reviewed three of the discs for this set, from the first, third, and sixth seasons and I can honestly say the lack of detail is apparent when up-converted.<br />Therefore, I cannot recommend the purchase of this set.<br /><br />Good:<br />Price is lower for complete season set<br /><br />Bad:<br />Quality of transfer is very bad and more pronounced when up converted to 1080P<br />Standard 4X3 screen dimension only<br />Some discs were incorrectly copied had have playback issues.
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|Legends in legendary performances!!<br />This is something one used to hear about when reading about the past and now we can listen to them!!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Really good book abouf the effects of socialism. But in a screwed up super socialistic fantasy way. Its a bit short.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great follow up with some cool ideas. The end fell a bit short but overall it was an entertaining read.
B00C2IGQBU|4.0|The steelbook is great, it stands out in my collection. The only thing I don't like about this version is the menu layout. When you put it in the blu ray player, it starts playing the film. When you press the disc menu button it goes to the special features, and there is no option for scene selection or audio options, etc. To get those you have to press a different button while the film is playing...maybe its just me but I don't like that at all
B00371V91S|4.0|Great book encouraging all of us become a linch pin or realising we already are.<br /><br />I like Sets good advices on what to do if you are in between or not sure what's next to succeed - very hands on a practical tips.<br /><br />I find this a good self help book for anyone at any level wanting to become more of a linch pin.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Very good episodes of the good wife. More law this time but it was excellent. One will definitely be pleased with this season. Promise
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This was a great book. I don't know if I'd call it a romance or comedy or suspense since they are all combined. The only thing that could improve it is if the editing was better. There were lots of missing words and some missing punctuation or I'd have given it five stars.
B00G32TD98|1.0|I  rented  this  movie  because I  wanted  to  enjoy it on my  big  screen  plasma  television,  but  there  was  some  sort  of  glitch  that  made  my  tv  shut off.  When I  rewinded  back  to  the  scene  that  shut  my  tv off,  it  made  it  turn  off  once  again  but  this  time  for  at  least 24hrs. I  thought I  had  to  return  my  tv  back  to  the  store  where I  bought  it from.
B00GFJ0NGQ|3.0|In any type of story-telling, the duration for explaining and transitioning from one occurrence to the next is just as special as the climatic and emotional occurrences that excites and involves a viewer or reader and the time needed to elaborate or illustrate certain occurrences is the \\"settle-ness\\" by which life operates within the \\"peaks-and-valleys\\" of climatic and emotional occurrences, for which this particular episode and Season 4 is good enough to keep me watching.

1451639155|5.0|Book number 15 of a 16+ loosely linked series of books with several other short story books.  Note, this book was published after _Cryburn_ but is about five years before _Cryoburn_.  Also note that this book was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award but<br />sadly lost to Scalzi's _Redshirts_ novel (which I have yet to read).<br /><br />I have really missed the Vorkosigan saga which peaked for me in _A Civil Campaign_.  _Cryoburn_, while very good, is not a great story.  Well, I've got a new story for you here about Ivan and I am finding it to be the second best book in the series.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book, I went, &#34;a book about Ivan?&#34;.  Yes, the book is firmly about Ivan and Ms. Bujold nailed it.  It has just the right amount of space opera, romance, intrigue, back stabbing, snarkiness and just all around things that make you stay up until 3 am just reading a &#34;few&#34; more chapters.<br /><br />BTW, I wanted to rate this book 6 out of 5 stars but Amazon would not let me.

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Easily the best, hardest hitting, most amazing album Stryper has done, and I'm a huge fan so that is really saying something!  I am so happy that it isn't a flat, &#34;Oh let's release and album&#34; come back!  I can not WAIT to see these guys perform these songs in concert!!!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is an excellent series so far, and this first season gets you hooked!  Here you are, rooting for a serial killer (who happens to be a blood analyst for the Miami Police), because he goes after the bad guys that justice lets go free on technicalities.  Lots of insight into what Dexter thinks, and the dilemmas he faces.  Very entertaining!
160774418X|5.0|First, I am a big Ottolenghi fan and have all of his cookbooks and from time to time use additional recipes from his Guardian column.<br />Second, I like near- and middle-eastern food and cooking.  One of the key things about Ottolenghi is that you can improvise as needed or desired -- with regard to the types and amount of ingredients.  He clearly has to do that himself depending on the season and location.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Mr Grisham has come back to a good story of the hard scrabble life of a good lawyer who fell on hard times.  He gets a big case, facing formidable odds.  The story unfolds throughout, mostly well drawn, that take the reader on a wild ride.  I enjoyed the book, like I did his earliest work.
B00FE5N09Y|4.0|Love this show!! Any ideas when this will actually be released? Yes, I'm aware the final season is still airing on TV, I'm just really looking forward to surprising someone with this.
B00FLDG52I|5.0|Did you know that Layla is on the 2004 DVD, even though it is not listed anywhere on the jacket? Here is how to find it: Disc 2, go to Extras, Interviews, Guitar Solos, then Main. Hit your left directional button, then hit play & bingo, you have Layla. At least, that's how I find it on my Oppo DVD player. I learned this trick from an Amazon reviewer years ago when this DVD first came out.
1250038820|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this book- as a fan of the blog and a New Yorker this book really is touching and amazing.  The images are moving and the quotes and essays are exactly what you'd expect from HON.  Highly recommend to everyone-- I have already sent a copy to one of my family members and I'm sure many others will be getting this as a gift this year!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Update: I am changing my Amazon rating to 5 Stars, and adding this update, simply because this is a very good bio and guidebook for entrepreneurs, and it's well worth reading, priced low, and fun and fast to read. My only gripe is explained in my earlier review below. For some inexplicable reason, Mark or his publishers chose to format half of this book vertically, making those portions excruciating to read. The poor formatting and difficulty reading those parts means that this item really deserves only 4 Stars, but because what Mark has to say is so valuable, I am listing it as 5 Stars. If the formatting was corrected, I would give this book 10 Stars.<br /><br />Former review:<br /><br />This is a well written, fast-paced, well-priced memoir. I only wish I could read all of it. 80% of the Kindle edition is formatted vertically, with letters and words going from top to bottom. I don't know if Cuban or his publisher are trying to be clever by using verticle layout to emphasize the important life principles, but it's so hard to read this vertically it's not worth the trouble. I give up. Sorry this didn't work out. Cute layout = Fail.
B00EDPFJA4|1.0|Drake uses auto tune because he can't sing. He has other people write his lyrics because he has no lyrical talent, he can't freestyle one bar, he acts emotional and deep with a fake 'gangsta' edge, etc.... If you are into hashtags, fitted hats, taking selfies, heroin, perk 30's, and acting like a hardass because you are insecure about your rich/white up bringing, you will love this! Fans of real music, stay far away.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|I pre-ordered this book, but only was able to read it a few months ago. I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. The First 20 Hours has supercharged my achievement. Since finishing the book (a quick, pleasant read), I have accomplished numerous goals, easily and fast. For example: 1. I wrote, formatted, and published my first ebook, \\"The 1-Month Ban\\", available on Amazon Lending Library for Prime. 2. I finally learned an effective touch-typing method, the Colemak Keyboard system, following Josh Kaufman's instructions after a whole lifetime of being a \\"search and poke typist\\". For someone who writes all the time like me, this one accomplishment is worth 5x the book's cover price. Even more, Josh explained in the book how to learn Colemak typing very fast and almost automatically. 3. Obviously, Josh and I have similar interests; we are both interested in the East Asian classic game of Go. Josh provided insights into the game, it's history, and learning it, which I can incorporate into my play. 4. Josh's step-by-step learning system simplifies the process of skill acquisition so much, it motivates you to make progress. I followed his steps, and outfitted myself with 3 musical instruments I am learning: A penny whistle, drumsticks and pad, and an inexpensive 54-key electronic keyboard. Since I move and travel frequently, I can carry the whistle and drum equipment in my carry-on bag; the $45 keyboard is cheap enough to leave behind or store. 5. Josh provides 10 Keys to Rapid Skill Acquisition that systematically guide you to make fast progress, and motivate you through simplicity and ease.<br />I could give you more info, but you really should just buy and read the book. It is well worth the modest price. Even if The First 20 Hours was priced at $50 or $100 or $200, the dramatic progress it helps you make would be well worth it.<br />I also read and use Josh's first book and website, The Personal MBA. Through that, I am refining my personal MBA with triple concentration in Finance, Marketing, and Economic Development, all for a few hundred dollars in books and materials instead of $200,000 for a business school.<br />Josh's research and cutting edge methodology is helping to revolutionize and advance the burgeoning self-education, personal/home-study, self-accreditation, business learning, and online movements. This book saves you time, effort, energy, motivates you and profits you with tangible progress and dramatic achievement. Don't put it off any longer, climb on board your train and leave the station on your personal journey with Josh's books.ance, Marketing, and Economic Development, all for a few hundred dollars in books and materials instead of $200,000 for a business school.<br />Josh's research and cutting edge methodology is helping to revolutionize and advance the burgeoning self-education, personal/home-study, self-accreditation, business learning, and online movements.

1573229725|5.0|Beautiful writing and wonderful characterisation, yet studded with plot twists and turns that give genuine surprise. Historical thrillers often fall into the trap of too much &#34;telling&#34; and not enough &#34;showing&#34;, as the writer tries to bring to life the details of the age. But in this book Waters does a majestic job of re-creating the world of Dickens without flaunting her research or over-explaining. The era comes to life naturally and with great vibrancy. Loved it. Given how the story unfolds, the title is also inspired.
B00376AVZ8|5.0|Great art. Great music. This looks so cool framed on the wall of my study where in case you have noticed Mingus rules
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very easy to use. And I use it all the time very nice for a free app on the kindle.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|As the levels progress the game finally begins to develop some difficulty but for a quick distraction between meetings or on a plane, this is great and keeps the mind active! Each level only takes me about 30 seconds to complete so they're fun and super quick :-)

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a really great game but sometimes frustrating! Sometimes it's like the computer won't let you win a level until it wants you to. You get stuck for weeks. And sometimes all your extra lives that friends give you will just disappear. I had 200+ extra lives and moves and one day they just were gone. Frustrating. Worth downloading though. Fun!!
B003XMWSSY|5.0|Most how to write books bog down in too much detail. Not so this one. The author keeps the chapters short, uses many examples, and assigns exercises. Concepts I had read about elsewhere finally made sense.<br />Too much to digest in one reading so it might help to come back for another read 6 months or a year later.
0385523912|5.0|What does it mean to be an ordinary citizen in a country as dictoral and as isolated as North Korea? Barbara Demick seeks to answer this question through the fated lives of a handful of defectors.<br /><br />Nothing to Envy follows six DPRK citizens from it's peak era [the height of the cold war] to it's most destructive [the late 90s] to it's constant brink of collapse, the 2000s. We take a journey through the countries incredible culture that is parallel to George Orwells 1984. The country is great, and questioning that will certainly lead you to dealing with the police, if not one of the countries prison camps. Productivity is high and if you dare mention that you can't get a pair of shoes, you'll vanish in the night. Food is aplenty, even if you aren't recieving your weeks pay for your labour. They have the best medical system in the world, even if they can't afford to treat illnesses that have all but vanished from the rest of the world. And worst yet, their country could be even greater, if not for the American imperialists, who seem to be providing food amist the famine.<br /><br />The history of the DPRK and all it's political details [at least what is available] is told through a variety of characters, from a doctor, to a high class citizen living in Pyongyang to a middle class girl, who was most vunerable to the famine in the 90s.<br /><br />It is impossible to describe the expierence I had reading this book. The phrase 'stanger than fiction' came to mind quite often though.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this all the time. Very simple and easy to use. I love the fact that the numbers are big, which makes it that much easier to push the right button. That's important who want to keep going back because the wrong buttons was pushed due to the fact that the keys are small. Keys are nice and big.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Amazing album.  Talented and unique artist puts his all into this.  Solid from start to finish.  I would expect some grammy's in the near future.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|Excellent film. It treats Marilyn as someone deserving of empathy as opposed to someone who just should have been pitied. IT shows her as human, unhappy and needy, but also showed that she had a charming and sensitive side to her. Very well done.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I have been a fan of the girls for the last year & a half & have been playing their songs on repeat via youtube for aaages. Finally some \\"new\\" music! There were just a few tracks that we hadn't heard before on this album and there wasn't a single disappointment. Saw them live last week and they rule. I cannot wait for SNL to give them more exposure in a couple weeks. It sucks when some artists have more talent than fame (and vice versa!).
B003INBNXO|5.0|I have seen all Bruce Lee movies and many other martial arts movies. That including Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal, Jackie Chan, David Carradine and Jet Li. This movie can be compared to Enter the Dragon or Return of the Dragon starring Bruce Lee. It is that good. I understand now how Bruce Lee became as legendary. He learned from the best: Ip man. There are many memorable fighting scenes in this movie; some emotional moments as well. Donnie Yen at his best. Excellent picture quality. The movie is dubbed in English with optional English subtitles.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Within the last four or five years the name of the band Arcade Fire has buzzed around in my ears and into my eyes from almost every direction. Something about the way they were set up to me though had a similar flavor to how My Morning Jacket were presented: as basically just another indie pop band whose devoted cult of personality were trying to use their interest in said band to start a new musical credibility war with other music admirers. Of course not listening to much radio and neglecting contemporary music press by and large didn't help matters in my case. Wikipedia can be a wonderful thing,especially when I found out the reason for this bands notoriety was because of their...commercial and creative success. Since two of my favorite artists,Rush and Gino Vanelli,both hail from Canada I had a good feeling about what I'd hear from these Montreal natives. So I decided to do my usual music research-a little sampling to see if the music would be personally appealing and than listening to the entire album to get the full affect. And...suffice it to say it's definitely quite the full affect indeed.<br /><br />  The double album starts out with the title song and \\"We Exist\\"-both pulsing,stripped down funk-rockers both coming out of a really strong groove. \\"Flashbulb Eyes\\" takes a very steampunk rhythmic approach with unique percussive effects before going into \\"Here Comes The Night Time\\"-another favorite of mine here that has has something of a skipping beat with this ARP string-like synthesizer melody leading it along. \\"Normal Person\\" is a driving rocker that avoids being stereotypical 90's hard rock revival by the sonically clean sea of what sound like multi tracked lead guitars that give the sound a harmonic hugeness. \\"You Already Know\\",a bouncy jangle pop number goes on into the 50's rock n soul oriented \\"Joan Of Arc\\"-both benefiting strong from Elvis Presley/Gene Vincent/John Lennon style vocal reverb. The second half of the album begins with a continuation of the already sonically heady \\"Here Comes The Night Time II\\" before going into \\"Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)\\"-another rhythmically complex number with an even faster paced use of that steampunk oriented percussive sound. \\"It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus)\\" again has this huge,almost angelic melodic dance/rock approach whereas \\"Porno\\" and \\"Afterlife\\" are more minimalist pulsing examples of that style. The equally stripped back percussive folk/rock like \\"Supersymmetry\\" concludes the album with a long 6+ minute ambient electronic outro.<br /><br />  If I can say one thing about this album is that it's possessed of a sound that's extremely thick with musical ideas. A lot of bands do this,especially from the more psychedelic angle where the sounds are all meant to abstractly bleed together in the manner of a hallucinatory experience. I personally don't find anything remotely hallucinatory about this album. However this albums does seem to come at the idea of organically creating this swelling mix of electronica,minimalist pop and rock 'n roll with a great deal of funky rhythmic undertones. Its wonderful to see a band sonically exploring musical journeys that were started some time ago by now iconic groups such as The Rolling Stones,Talking Heads and XTC. If someone were in fact to ask me to explain the music on this album to someone who was as uninitiated on Arcade Fire as I was before this album,I would in fact use those three artists as hopefully adequate musical frames of references. This also has the advantage of being one of those albums where its apparent that,the more times one hears it,they'll receive totally different qualities musically than they did the first time. Its easy to see why Arcade Fire are so revered today after hearing this album. So this has certainly peaked an interest in their musical art.he already sonically heady \\"Here Comes The Night Time II\\" before going into \\"Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)\\"-another rhythmically complex number with an even faster paced use of that steampunk oriented percussive sound. \\"It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus)\\" again has this huge,almost angelic melodic dance/rock approach whereas \\"Porno\\" and \\"Afterlife\\" are more minimalist pulsing examples of that style.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased this to use with my MacBook Pro, running OS 10.6.8. When I went to set it up, it told me I needed OS 10.7. If I upgrade to 10.7, I will have to upgrade over $1,000 worth of software. So, I bought a Google tablet, Samsung Nexus 10. This enabled me to set it up, but I could not cast from Chrome Tabs, because that app does not exist. I could cast from YouTube, Netflix, but not Chrome Tabs. So, I tried my Mac and I can cast from Chrome Tabs from it, even running OS 10.6.8. It works well, but I can't give it a 5, because I can't believe they require me to use my laptop to cast Chrome Tabs. I would love to be able to cast those tabs from my tablet, as it is a lot less to have in my lap. Oh well, maybe someday.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Lovely, well-written book. I wrote an extensive essay on my thoughts as a recording musician on my blog at [...] regarding this book and how introversion applied to me as a non-performing musician. This probably describes a lot of artists out there. Not everyone likes to be on stage and finds another way to oractice their art without having to be in an uncomfortable (and impossible) spotlight. I'm glad someone came along and encapsulated what we've known all these years so well. Many thanks to the author for writing this!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I absolutely love every track on this CD there is not one that I do not love ; it is absolutely the best Michael Jackson album ever!<br />Before this album I was a so-so M J fan, now I listen to this album often while sitting inmy Man Cave. If you are a Michael Jackson fan or just a memory lane listener (like me) buy this CD (you will not be disapointed)

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I fell into this story so easily as I know this boy as myself.  If only I had Lettie to shield me from and to teach me not to fear.  But that is what we all have to learn to do on our own armed only with the hope someone cares enough to come to our aid.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This is unlike any Bryson book I have read but being interested in history I found this book fascinating. The descriptions of events and and in depth look at the people that shaped them is incredible. I have enthusiastically recommended this book to others, a great read!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl was to me a reach of reality. Granted the world has seen many schemes for many reasons, this one did not hold much plausibility throughout from the very beginning to the very end. I imagined the author writing away to find herself in a place where she need think, 'Oh now, what do I move this story on now!' It felt as if she was winging it all the way. The fact that the story ends with these two people are staying together and having a child is sick.  Amy is still a flaming psych-path and he is an unquestioning codependent. Perhaps the main character Amy will follow the path of her writer parents and create shallow books about her own child. There was suspense and the vehicle of the diary and the flashbacks provided a semi-interesting way to slowly reveal the plot.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|My wife and I love most of what we've seen on 1800s English life.  We especially like class conflicts, and vivid depictions of society snobs.  In this way, Little Dorrit was wonderful.  Dickens treats the lower classes with considerable dignity and respect, and makes it very clear that they, too, are people, and are no less deserving of happiness than any of the \\"upper\\" classes.<br /><br />However, he also makes it very clear just how foolish it is for anyone, whether rich or poor, to strive for the acceptance of high society.<br /><br />This production was very well done, and it kept us up late for several nights.<br /><br />If we could add stars, this would probably rate a seven.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books!!!! I have read them several times and every time I am again completely engrossed!!! Amazing :)
B00742GBDM|4.0|This novel provides the usual pleasures of reading Jane Austen: Elegant and incisive prose. I took particular pleasure in her long sentences, often with more than one dependent clause, and even dependent clauses within dependent clauses, which remain lucid and thus articulate the relationship between ideas. A plot that is the usual question of finding a husband for the heroine and for other important female characters, threaded among complex circles character conflict and family and class relationships. Leading characters that are thoroughly realized human beings. Jane Austen tends to keep her distance from her characters -; she presents them a little bit as if they were in a painting we all admire. This distance is more striking in this novel than in, say, Pride and Prejudice. Austin does not like all these people she has created, and freely spends the sharpness of her wit upon them.<br /><br />The pater familias of this novel is Sir Thomas Bertram, baronet. His wife, Lady Bertram, is a woman so indolent as to be almost inanimate. Her younger sister had married below her class and had several children by a drunken sailor. The baronet takes one of these daughters into his household at age 8, the protagonist, Fanny Price. Lady Bertram has another sister who is part of the household by virtue of being married to the clergyman annexed to the baronet's estate, Mrs. Norris. Aunt Norris is not exactly a villainess, but she is so self-centered, self-deceiving, and power-hungry that she harms the lives of everyone around her especially Fanny. She never lets Fanny forget she is a poor relation although, or because, Mrs. Norris is in a similar position.<br /><br />Two issues interested me in this rereading of the novel: the limitations of Fanny as a heroine, and telling rather than showing.<br /><br />Fanny is no Elizabeth Bennett. Though she is smart and eventually grows up pretty, Fanny is a problematic because she is a boring little prig. I have heard her compared to the treacle-sweet heroine of Bleak House. There is considerable tension in this novel between what we might see as moderate sexual license versus an attitude of intense and fearful defense of an appearance of chastity and fidelity. All this in an society where the threat of scandal could quickly ruin a woman's life. For example, while the baronet is away tending to his estates in Antigua, the young people stage a somewhat flirtatious and suggestive theatrical. Fanny is stubbornly opposed to such goings-on, which earns her points with a clergyman cousin who is a potential suitor and with her uncle when he returns. But does it earn points with the author or the reader?<br /><br />To put this in context, note that Jane Austen's family frequently put on theatricals, usually restoration comedies, when she was growing up in which she almost certainly performed. Bear in mind also the recent republication of Austin's early novel Lady Susan, in which the heroine is a sexual predator, and that Jane Austen's aunt almost certainly derived what little financial security she enjoyed from being the mistress of Warren Hastings.<br /><br />Fanny has integrity, intelligence, and stubbornness and sticks to her guns when various family members put pressure on her to marry a man whom she perceives to be wrong for her. She also passingly brings up the morality of the slave trade with her uncle, albeit inconclusively. As far as I know that is the only mention of the slavery, a live issue at the time, in Austin's work.<br /><br />In creative writing classes and stereotyped advice to writers you often hear the formula, \\"show don't tell.\\" I note with interest that the final three chapters of Mansfield Park, which very successfully tie up numerous plot lines and consummate or foresee various marriages, are entirely told. Of course, we know all the characters pretty well by then so we don't need \\"showing\\" as an exposition of character. But still, it is a resounding example contrary to the \\"show don't tell\\" formula.'t tell\\" formula.

B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I'm a little late coming to the \\"party\\" for this latest release by Country superstar Alan Jackson, but I hope  my two-cents add some guidance to readers.<br /><br />Jackson has been around the \\"new country\\" business for years with many hits on Top 40 country radio but, as he says (yes, literally SAY as he recites the albums credits during the final track - Bill Monroe's \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" one of the six songs Jackson didn't write of the 14 tracks on this hour-long album. (60 minutes is long for both a bluegrass album or a country album.).<br /><br />As others have said, Jackson is trying to relax and play some down-home bluegrass but he also doesn't want to disappoint his \\"country\\" fans, so he gives a little bit of each a chance. Soungs like \\"Blue Ridge Mountain Song\\", \\"Tie me Down\\" \\"Knew All Along\\" are hardly bluegrass but \\"There is A Time\\", \\"Blacktop\\" and, of course, that closing track are. So you get it both ways.<br /><br />Unlike both country and bluegrass albums these days, the lyrics to all the songs are included in the 12 page booklet in the jewel box. And it's all in basic \\"black and white primt\\" too. The release is on Jackson's own label (ACR) but is distributed by EMI. This may not put him back on Top 40 country radio, but Jackson's fine financially outside Nashville. So he did this one for \\"fun\\" and, hey, I'm fine with that.  I've been replaying it a lot.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

1476734941|2.0|The great allure of this diet is that, in addition to reducing weight, it promises to increase your lifespan, lower the risk of cancer and dementia, and even improve your mood. Nevertheless, while there is indeed a lot of evidence showing that low calorie diets can extend lifespan, the theory that intermittent fasting can cause all these benefits by triggering certain metabolic responses in our bodies seems highly speculative. There are just no scientific studies yet proving that these effects are real.<br /><br />One of the authors – a doctor – urges people to follow a radical diet based on some preliminary studies that are still very far from understanding how fasting affects metabolism, and on anecdotal evidence from a few people who went on the diet, especially his own experience. The problem is that telling people what to do based on the experience of one person is like trying to publish a scientific paper doing statistical analysis on a sample of one individual (n=1) – it is not going to be accepted anywhere. He tells us that, while on the diet, he lost several pounds and that his blood chemistry improved significantly. But what would you expect after you reduce your calorie intake by 75% during two days of the week? Probably some weight loss, no? Traditional diets can lower your weight and your cholesterol levels, the main challenge is sticking to the diet. The authors argue that it is much easier to stay on the 5:2 diet than other diets. Now, if you take a look at their website, you’ll find that some people noted that they were not able to obtain the same results. The authors replied by saying that these people were probably not following the diet properly, but maybe it is not so easy to fast two days a week after all.<br /><br />My main concern, however, is that the book does not discuss the potential side effects of fasting, something that I have learned from my own experience. I suffer from atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia that can be dangerous if untreated because it can produce a blood clot that can go to the brain and causes a stroke. My arrhythmia was completely under control, no symptoms at all, before I tried intermittent fasting. However, it came back in my very first day of fasting. To make sure, I tried fasting two more times, and the arrhythmia always came back, and always disappeared after I interrupted the fast, so there was no doubt in my mind that fasting triggered it.<br /><br />Obviously, I should have checked with my doctor before doing it, especially because I had a pre-existing condition. However, even assuming that this could be a rare side-effect, it does not bode well for intermittent fasting diet as the wonderful panacea the book claims. Aside from warning that people with diabetes should not try fasting, the authors do not discuss potential side effects. If fasting can trigger heart arrhythmia, who can guarantee that it does not have other potentially dangerous side effects, as there are very few studies on the subject and even the authors admit that no one knows exactly how fasting affects the body?<br /><br />I hope the people who decide to go on the 5:2 diet get all the wonderful benefits that the authors claim. In light of my own experience, though, I just thought it would be worth offering a word of caution.

Netflix streams great all the way in the living room, away from the router's strongest Wifi signal area. I highly recommend it. Set up has been a snap with all three.

B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist (1973) was never expected to become the classic that it is today. With an estimated budget of $10,497,444, Director William Friedkin mortified and disturbed teens and adults so severely that The Exorcist is known as the “scariest movie ever made”. The version of this movie that I viewed is the Director’s cut; this version does not omit anything, it is actually longer than the originally released one. The Director’s Cut is William Friedkin’s original finished work, but because of the graphic nature of the Director’s Cut, some scenes were cut to be more suitable for movie theater viewing. The original and current Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) in the United States is R for its strong language and disturbing images.<br /> The Exorcist takes place in Georgetown in the current day of the movie’s release (1973). The movie follows the life of a twelve-year-old girl, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), during the duration of her possession by an evil demon that claims to be the Devil. The opening scene of the movie takes place in Iraq at an archaeological site where Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) is working; during this scene a figurine is found that you see throughout the whole movie and seems to have ties to Regan’s possession. You are then introduced to Regan and her Mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn). Regan’s Mother is an actress; she and Regan had just moved to Georgetown in Washington D.C. for the movie Chris was starring in. During this introduction Regan is a completely normal twelve-year-old girl who is excited about a horse she had seen that day and loves crafts; but Chris finds an Ouija board in the basement that Regan claims to use to talk to a ghost named “Captain Howdy”.<br /> As the movie progresses strange things begin happening in the house, like banging sounds in the attic and the window in Regan’s room being open, making the room freezing cold. After an incident where Regan’s bed begins shaking her personality begins to completely change. Chris takes her to the doctor where they believe that she just needs to take a medication, Adderall, and she will soon be better. After a scan of her brain they find that there aren’t any abnormalities which make her behavior much less explainable. The possession really takes hold of Regan after the scans. The possession of Regan results in the death of three characters and multiple scenes that contain an overwhelming amount of profanity, sexual references and innuendoes, and violence that all come from 12-year-old Regan.<br />Although The Exorcist was released in 1973, it displays excellent use of special effects. The face of a demon that appears in some places is used frequently; the demons face is always just an overlay on the film rather than an actor that is actually being filmed with the scene. They also sometimes overlay photos of the figurine found in the archeological site. Some other advanced and convincing effects used were making Regan’s bed shake, making her head spin around, violent thrashing, cuts that are caused by holy water being thrown as if it was a whip, and projectile vomiting.<br />Sound is something used very often to achieve different effects. Music played always matches the type of scene. For example, suspenseful music is played during suspenseful scenes. The iconic Exorcist theme song, Tubular Bells, is played right before some of the strange things with Regan happen while Chris is walking home. They also make sounds louder to put emphasis on things. During a scene where Father Merrin is going to leave Iraq, the sounds of traffic and working people is amplified as well as the sounds of dogs fighting when he looks at a larger version of the evil figurine that was found. You also see this in a scene where Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) is going to visit his Mother, in a city neighborhood that isn’t as well off as the other neighborhoods you see in the movie, any sounds that are negative like a woman yelling or children jumping on a car are very loud in comparison to other sounds in the scene. Another interesting use of sound is the many voices that Regan has when she is possessed. She takes on the voice of the demon (Mercedes McCambridge) as well as some other voices, one of which is the voice of Father Damian’s Mother (Vasiliki Maliaros); these voices are added seamlessly and match up with Regan’s mouth movements very well.<br />Lighting is something else that was used a lot (and well) to create different atmospheric effects. In Iraq most of the lighting that was prominent was from the sunrise and sunset. The sun would always be very bright yellow on a very red sky. Most lighting in the movie is created just by the regular light of the room, like a lamp or harsh fluorescent lighting.<br />The makeup used is very convincing. The longer Regan is possessed, the less human she begins to look; this effect is accomplished by first making her become pale with very dry and cracking lips, and then by progressively creating the look of sores, cuts, and bruises all over her. They also successfully created a false stomach over Regan’s real stomach that had very pronounced ribs and the words “Help me” that appeared to have been written from inside her stomach. There wasn’t any makeup that wasn’t perfectly executed.<br />The actors in The Exorcist performed very well. Everyone does an excellent job expressing the emotions that you imagine someone would feel in the situation that they are in. I am especially impressed with Linda Blair’s performance, she was very young when she portrayed the possessed main character of this movie, she had to take on multiple personalities for her character and she did so flawlessly. There wasn’t any acting in the movie that I can think of a complaint for.<br />Some people may argue that The Exorcist isn’t really the “scariest movie ever made” or that it really isn’t as good as I think it is; most of this is due to the age of the movie. Many people see the special effects in The Exorcist as cheesy and therefore the movie as not scary. When I see The Exorcist I see amazing effects for its time and an incredibly scary movie psychologically. Overall it is hard to argue that The Exorcist is not a great movie. Of all the horror movies that have been made, The Exorcist has to be one of the most classic and most compelling of them all.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I liked this app at first, especially the OCR feature - but I'm finding it to be very intrusive. I installed it on my PC so I could sync my notes, and not only did it sync several times a day even when there were no new notes, it also slowed other programs down.<br /><br />It seems as though every time I open my Kindle there's a new update for this app. Improvements are good, but there are so many of them that it's starting to be irritating.<br /><br />Apps should do what they are meant to do without demanding constant attention. I'm going to look for one that stays in the background until I need it.

B0046179EO|4.0|I've heard &#34;Baby Blue&#34; and &#34;Day After Day&#34; thousands of times, but I've never delved into their catalog much. I know they were signed to the Apple label and were kind of a pet project of Paul's. They even come off sounding a bit like the Beatles, which is why I kind of dismissed them before. When I had the opportunity of purchasing a greatest hits, or &#34;best of&#34; collection on sale, I bit. I don't regret it. They obviously had talent, or the Beatles would have never signed them! It's too bad they couldn't get out of the shadow of the Beatles the way Bad Company came out of the shadows of Led Zeppelin. They both had excellent singers, but Paul Rogers sounds nothing like Robert Plant!

B008UX8G5A|1.0|This would be a readable book (I forced myself to read it) if the author didn't jump back and forth constantly through time in the story. It makes it really hard to follow the chain of events and you end up forgetting things or becoming confused. Some of Weir's other books don't do this, so obviously she is capable of following a timeline. I also didn't need sentences randomly placed in the paragraphs that were written about the present, such as when and where they found Anne's bones. It completely ruined the storytelling experience for me. Footnotes or something at the bottom of the page or end of the book would have sufficed. This was poor writing whether you want this for the artistry or for the facts.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Don't understand how it works.  When you start out it gives you a TARGET of 23000 example.  THen you play and have a score of 65380 after you are out of plays.  Then it comes up Play and if you select that -- you are ask to share or pay .99 cents or 1.99 before you can play on. Your other choice is to end game and start again.  This is just not user friendly for me because I am not on facebook and I don't want to pay to play.  I have played BEJEWELED for years and enjoyed it a lot.  This is just not as much fun for me.

B002RZZIXU|5.0|Set in 1976, Restless is really two stories for the price of one. The daughter is, I suppose, the protagonist, writing in the First Person and discovering - much to her surprise - that the mother she has always known had a very different life during the Second World War.<br /><br />The mother’s story is told in the Third Person, thus firmly establishing the two distinct stories. And while the reader is with her she is the protagonist. Who can say which is the major storyline here? Who wants to? - it’s a well-crafted tale, not intending, I feel, to be a major spy thriller. Imagine what it would be like to learn that one of your parents was someone completely different many years before you were born. This is what the story is about, while at the same time taking us into a realistic world of espionage we’ve not been in before. I thank William Boyd for letting me see.<br /><br />I’m sorry that the reviewers who left negative comments are having so bad a time in their own lives that they want to sour the hard work of this author.<br /><br />I gave this 5 stars because of the book and not the TV movie, which I feel does not do justice to the book. No disrespect to the actresses, but it seems to me they were miscast. Please do not judge this book by the TV version.

B0030B624E|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I honestly didn't think I'd like it since comedy + horror usually ends up with something horribly lame and cringe-worthy. I watched this movie for the millionth time last night so I figured I'd write a review simply saying that this movie is one I can watch over and over and enjoy every time.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie was the culmination-and a perfect character and trilogy arch-of the franchise constantly building upon itself.  To come from a series meant for kids; then to be a legitimate movie regardless of genre, is very satisfying.  This is a great movie-full of plot twists you won't see coming-that becomes bittersweet (Christian Bale's last one).  The dark cinematography creates the mood for the film right from the get go.  I hope the next installment-whenever that is-honors this formidable trilogy!
B000SL1P9G|1.0|Ordered from America, received Italian version. Did not play in any device. Waiting for the combo pack, making sure it's coded for America this time
B00AW57L96|5.0|It took me a long time to decide to purchase this one as<br />I felt it might be a rather repetitive storyline. I am so glad I did<br />as I enjoyed it, and the ending may surprise other readers
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|works but a little limited in the services it can broadcast. Still a bargain for the price. Use it on a second TV
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Scariest movie I've ever seen and the first time I saw it, of course, I started watching it late at night in a basement TV room. Needless to say, it scared me to death but not so much that I can't watch it again!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Love this movie as well as Firefly: The Series. Great ensemble cast, action, and thrills. As far as I'm concerned Joss Whedon can do no wrong.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Its star wars and angry birds combined. Its the best of AB Space and classic AB with a Star Wars twist.
B0064MT1FI|4.0|I hate doing movie reviews because everyone likes something different... This movie is a little &#34;off&#34; the beaten bath, contains strong sexual content, material and nudity.  So if that offends you, you probably wouldn't like it. However, having said that, I found the story compelling and engaging.
006202406X|1.0|After finishing Insurgent I was counting the days because I was so excited to read the next book. I went to the mailbox searching for my book. What a let down!! There were times I would zone out and have to look back to see whose perspective I was reading. There were so many missed opportunities this book had. Shame on you Ms. Roth! Going for shock value does not make you a better author!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Awesome!!!! I had not seen this since I was 22 and I'm now 38. Still just as scary! I loved it!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Cute game! Delightful to play. Really keeps you focused and gives you a great challenge. Come and enjoy the fun. You won't be disappointed!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I Liked it all - the mystery and the characters. It was a fun mix of history, mystery, and fantasy and the pictures make you feel like you are there and it all might just be real.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|A  poignant story of a woman's dedication to a very impaired young man.  A beautifully written, sometimes unbelievable, but heart-warming novel
B00DW1WR14|5.0|As a person who relished Pearl Jam's music in the 90s and fell out of love with the band after 2000, this is a great album that reminds me why Pearl Jam's music changed my adult life.  The album ranges from a singer-songwriter vibe (Sleeping by Myself), to a dramatic introspective thing (Sirens) to true play it loud rock.  As usual, Vedder kicks butt as a vocalist bringing emotion to what could be hackneyed themes -- loss, love, freedom.  (I lost interest in Vedder's solo projects, however, because he can't do it alone.)  Ament on bass holds it down.  The arrangements throughout the album are fantastic, really giving you more feeling than the words alone.  Lyrics + Vedder + bass + arrangements = Classic PJ.  When I listen to this album, I remember why PJ inspired a lot of the great bands that are touring today. I will play this album for a very long time.
B0008ENIAC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. I ordered it before going to see a live spoof on the movie. I wanted to know what the movie was about so I would know what they were spoofing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. It's the best way EVER to waste time. Gets pretty hard in the higher levels but I always go back and play the easier ones I like.
B006O6F4O6|4.0|Very good, I only wish is a little bigger and the same scale as the tumbler, and that I could fit other Batman's figures in it, not just the stock one (it doesnt' move the legs, so it's made just to sit in the bike).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The author spins a good tale.  Seems plausible.  Starts to drag a little about three quarters the way through.  Liked the character development and with Mr. Grisham's twists and turns, the good guys win.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|The Superman reboot is what I considered the Matrix effect. It's a movie that suddenly blows us away with great speech, action and a reimagining of what we know about the Superman Mythos. Everything seems more realistic and relatable. The fights were hard core, such as the fight between Kal and Faora. The final battle between Zod and Krypton is like watching Dragon ball-Z but with superheroes, one of the biggest complaints was that there was too much destruction and fighting, but it's superman. That's like saying there's too much stealth in a batman movie, it's a man from outer space against an army of beings exactly like him that can't really get hurt in a city, there's going to be destruction. And there a lot of cameos. In the end, Man of Steel is considered the Matrix as it was unexpected and redefines the current era of Superhero movies. I gotta give it 5 stars!
B00123G51C|4.0|Have listened to Brubeck since the 1960's.  Still listen to &#34;old&#34; recordings.  Liked this one ... the artist grouping !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I seriously recommend this book to anyone who loves mystery and things like that. I couldn't even put it down! It was amazing, 5 stars!
1250038820|5.0|I love this book and the Humans of New York Facebook page.  I think the author should consider remaking the book Gig with photos.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is amazing. I could not put it down. I cannot wait to see the movie!!!!!! It's gonna be great!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|does exactly what it says.  works on my kindle fire<br />most of these that ive tried are crap.  this one actually works well.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|It's not perfect as a GPU but can run at very goes speeds is an amazing CPU so for games like minecraft it's amazing if you get a2gb GPU with this thing it'll blaze
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy way to stream YouTube videos or Netflix to your TV through your mobile phone or tablet.  Easy app download and setup.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game! I love how all the levels are different. I seen lots of games like this before but Bubble Mania is my favorite!!
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|I just got this app and before I got it I checked the reviews and they were good so I got it. Then when I opened it up it said &quot;you don't own this app&quot; and it said to &quot;exit&quot; or &quot;see more details&quot; I pressed more details and it came back to the app store and said &quot;open&quot; so I opened it again and the process started all over again!
0385366450|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints.  This is a long-awaited sequel to &#34;A Time To Kill.  Jake Brigance is back on the job.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|I hate books that go backwards. I would have liked to know more about their lives after children etc... but if you like these kind of books, then it's ok
B00EO4SBSG|3.0|I just finished listening to Vengeance Falls and I know I'm reiterating other peoples thoughts at this point but Jesus could you fit anymore of the Disturbed formula into this disc? While it's not as bad as say The Crusade (imo) I found myself drifting off in a lot of places because it all seems very familiar. It's not a terrible CD just extremely mediocre, It's missing the attitude of Shogun, which I was really hoping they would find that sound again. Draiman's influence is immediately recognizable, and while there are a few good songs peppered in at the beginning and end, it's just hard to sit through the whole experience. I hope this will end the Trivium/Draiman experiment.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love this show.  Great cast...great writing.  So simple...but so funny.  It's easy to see why Jim Parsons has won so many awards for this show...amazing!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Use your brain to solve the puzzles, but their not so hard that you get frustrated. Great way to s pass the time without having to think too hard. Need more puzzles for the price. Glad I got it for a free app of the day.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|Probably Biased Rating...<br /><br />My biggest critique of the show is that it is slightly over feminine for my taste.  I'm not Mr Rambo, but I wish there were a bit more of a masculine element most of the time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Well written, moves right along. A little repetitive. Not much new stuff about Jesus, see Steve Berry's Templar Legacy for much the same but in fiction form.
B002P79KAC|5.0|Love this show.  Great cast...great writing.  So simple...but so funny.  It's easy to see why Jim Parsons has won so many awards for this show...amazing!
159448385X|5.0|I chose these ratings because once I started reading I could not put down the book.  The story line flows so effortlessly and the writer's use of factual history makes it so compelling and brings forth so many emotions from the reader.  The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns are two of the best books I have ever read.
B0058BI896|4.0|This is probably my least favourite season of this series.  It's almost as if things get a little too pointlessly sexual.  I still love the show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it feels like you have a real horse. And it gives you facts and information about taking care of a real horse!!!!!!:)!!!:)!!!:)
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Love this show.  Great cast...great writing.  So simple...but so funny.  It's easy to see why Jim Parsons has won so many awards for this show...amazing!
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I love, studied, and know typography and wanted to correct this bafoon every time he made a blatant error around the history of type and printing. Gerritzoon drove me crazy. Can we just call it Bembo (the most beautiful typeface  of all time!) and give Mr Griffo some credit.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I've really enjoyed some of the creative surprises in this season.  Honestly, it seems like there have been some good &#34;walker&#34; scenes, but the overall plot almost seems to have slightly stalled...however, I look forward to the following episodes!
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Awesome movie. Full of non-stop action.  Fox and Tatum make a GREAT team. One of the best action films I've seen in a while.  I was on the edge of my seat.  You can't go wrong with White House Down.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book--struggled to put it down.  Characters were warm and believable.  Enjoyed watching them evolve.<br />Must read material about a little discussed period of our history.<br />I also enjoyed learning about the Native Americans and portaging--most interesting.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|My daughter loved this kit, it got her started making great bracelets, everything is included and it was easy to use
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never could quite predict what was going to happen. Character's were well developed. Lost sleep staying up reading it. Read it
1455807354|5.0|Every thing was as described. The story was very good. It was my first Jack Reacher novel. Very intriguing character.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Hey I love the show but I think it is losing a little excitement, I have only watched a couple episodes I hope we get something new. Right now it is getting a bit dull.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Amazon came in with flying colors with easy technology to provide me this movie. Never gave Amazon's service a second thought while watching this movie. That is what everyone wants in their shopping experience (its when we primarily indulge ourselves not anyone else or retailer/Amazon) to have now without any hassles. Sounds selfish, shopping is...shrug. My reasons for not doing it often!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|If this record had been released in 1988 as the followup to To Hell With The Devil, Stryper would have become one of the biggest acts of the era.  This is by far Stryper's heaviest record and every song is a keeper with &#34;No More Hell To Pay&#34; and &#34;Marching Into Battle&#34; being my favorites so far.  The guitar work is arguably better than anything Mike and Oz have put on tape before, Tim's bass comes across loud n' clear and the drums are tightly played by the visual timekeeper himself.<br />The vocals are what you expect from Stryper - amazing leads like only Michael Sweet can deliver and harmonic choruses that will be awesome to sing along to in a live setting, especially in songs like &#34;Water Into Wine&#34;
B000FBJHZS|4.0|I'm a big Dan Brown fan, and this was the second to last I read in the series. Dan Brown books can be a bit formulaic in their plot line, all following the same path, but this book held my interest nonetheless.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Extremely thought provoking material, well presented.  Hard questions dealt with by a knowledgeable source.<br />Very inspiring.  A courageous treatise for a man of science.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun, addictive, challenging game! Free download.  My husband and I both love playing Candy Crush.  We compete for top scores!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Would loved to have seen this in Imax movie theater.<br />60&#34; tv screen cannot due it justice<br />Movie is great
0062511408|5.0|Me enseño mucho de lo que puedo espera para el futuro ...Hoy se que tengo que tener paciencia y estar a tenta a mis señales y presentimientos para poder tomar cualquier desicion.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Sometimes when i think of this movie it explains a lot about the possible future of this plannet based on the mind sets of its poor leadership.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|This case has replaced my large Canon bag in airports and on travel excursions, opting, instead, to place battery chargers and lens covers in my laptop bag.  I am not a professional photographer so this little bag is handy to get about whilst traveling.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great cerebral game.  Wish it were longer.  It was a free game but would happily pay for a more in-depth version.
1609611543|5.0|Very thorough.  Excellent information.  Been using this plan for 8 weeks and am down 17 lbs.  This is a game changer!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I bought this for my daughter to complete her set of Twilight movies and she was happy to get it and I was happy with the price.
0307271080|5.0|Chiamanda Adichie's lead character Ifemulu is a woman who makes no apologies for who she is and who speaks her mind no matter what.  Even in situations where she is obviously at a power disadvantage/being provoked, she always has the last word. She would say something really funny and seemingly harmless but tart and(or) sarcastic in its delivery. As if  to say to the other party (often a higher authority of some sort) “I dare you to say something else(but never in a threatening or obvious way).”  Obinze her great love describes her as “the kind of woman who would make a man easily uproot his life, the kind who because she did not expect or ask for certainty, made a certain kind of sureness become possible.” This is what people mean when they say strong black woman. Well, at least this is what you hope they mean.<br /> Most of Chiamanda Adichie's work pre Americanah was reminiscent of the late 80's and the early 90's in Nigeria. Much like Lee Daniel's rendition of The Butler,  Adichie's earlier works instilled a sense of gratitude in me.  Even though I knew fully well that I would never really understand what it was like to live in that era, I was grateful for having been given a glimpse of it. Americanah however is the bridge between the 1990's and the post modern Nigeria as we know it.<br /> Americanah tells a story of a young girl who leaves her parents and her one true love(Obinze) in Nigeria to pursue the American dream. Upon arrival, Ifemelu learns the hard way that America isn't as easy as it is carved out to be.  By an act of god, she loses touch with Obinze and eventually meets Curt, whom she describes as having the “ cleft chinned handsomeness of models in department store catalogues.” Ifemelu and Curt's relationship is short lived because she cheats on him once with a neighbour.  In most of the chapters in Americanah, I am routing for Ifemelu because I see some of myself in her. But after she cheats on Curt, I felt a little resentment towards her.  And when Curt, calls her a b***, I am way ahead of him. . .<br /> Although seeing things from Ifemelu's perspective, interracial dating is hard on its own,  and I imagine dating someone who is thought to have won the genetic lottery among other lotteries that count in the upper class world by his inner circle including his pompous mother(who has a lot of similarities with Trey's mom in Sex and the City) would be a hard pill to swallow.  Regardless, all of  the problems they had(especially racial) which were through no fault his  and he always did his best to work around them by being very conscientious and perceptive. Like when he told Ifemelu that the  girl's(who were looking at her funny), their boyfriends were checking her out  all night or that time when he dropped her off at the spa to get her eyebrows waxed and the ladies there said they don't do curly. He rushed back in a fury and said “ You are going to f***** do my girlfriend's eyebrows or I'll shut down this f**** place. You don't deserve to have a license.”  Also, Curt always had the most interesting activities planned out for the weekend, he would fly her all around the world, got her her first job, adored her family and above all he treated her like a princess and held her like an egg. He was her knight in shinning armour, what more did she want. 21st century women say they want a chivalrous man, but can they really handle one?<br /> There are a lot of bold tones and themes in this book. Much like Americanah's lead character, the book is deliberately unapologetic and shocking. For instance Ifemelu having cheated on Curt with her scrawny neighbour Rob, in response to Curt saying “you gave him what he wanted,” she says “no I took what I wanted.” There is this general notion that women are not naturally inclined to want sex. Sex is something a man takes at the expense of a woman. Ifemelu's response challenges that notion. Another thing I found rather peculiar is the fact that Obinze finally leaves his wife for her. That almost never happens, well at least in the Nigerian culture.<br /> In conclusion, the mark of a good writer is capturing those mundane things about the idiosyncrasies of life that could go without saying and often do. Adichie does that brilliantly. Americanah is a vey socially dynamic book which is also generationally inclusive. Everyone can relate to the tone and setting in some way. A lot of jokes which I had thought to be 2% jokes were surprisingly perfectly understood by most of my friends who are from totally different cultures and backgrounds.  Americanah is versatile in its topics of discussion, such as: world travel, race, religion and sex. Americanah has been the precursor to very profound conversations I have had on the train as I flipped away at my pages on my way to work. It would be a good book to read in a book club. I am yet to meet a person who has read Americanah and does not have a strong opinion about it. Everyone has an opinion of Americanah!

B005LAIISA|5.0|Love all the Ice Age movies and this one is really good!  Definitely worth adding to your Ice Age collection!
0525478817|5.0|This is such an amazing story, i cried so hard reading this. I cant wait for the movie. John Green is an amazing writer.
0802473156|5.0|love the detail and then the Q&A section at the end with the tests that brought it all together.  I
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been watching my friends playing this game and now I can enjoy it too. Finally it is available on the Kindle and I am thoroughly enjoying playing this game. It was worth the wait.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|So good. Every song on this disk is awesome, and its long! 22 tracks and not one that I'd want to skip over. I've loved Eminem since he came out but wasn't as huge of a fan of Relapse. He won me back with Recovery, however, and I think this is better than Recovery. This disk is filled with differant beats and each song has a different feel (I actually teared up listening to Headlights). It just proves how amazing this man is at what he does.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I read all three and loved them.  I also saw the movie, &#34;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;; although, I really enjoyed it, as usual it doesn't compare to the detail in the book.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Ordered this for a friend and she loved the series  These wonderful British series are always excellent and a pleasure to view.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was imaginative and kept me wanting more. It's not my usual reading genre but I became intrigued and couldn't stop reading. Think about what we are doing to the planet now, and try to imagine the consequenses. What will happen 100, 200 or 1,000 years into the future. Howey presents one possibility that makes you think. Maybe this is far fetched but it makes you wonder if maybe we should be a little more careful about the legacy we leave for future generations.
B002QW5ZC8|5.0|AMAZING CD and DVD,  top quality everything. The elegant detail of the covers,  cds,  and booklet are astounding!!!!!!!!!!!!  I highly recommend!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Trucks tricky tricky  I totally as only love it!!!!!!!!!!!<br />My coolest game I have. Why don't you get this game
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Wow Franco can't act, and Mila is not. Believable.  You don't ever get the Oz character nor accept his behavior as being  cause related.  You gotta make us feel sorry for someone before we accept their being able to behave  outside morals
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm not the biggest of readers. My wife suggested this book and turns out the book is really well written and fun to read. Enjoy!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a nice fun app..could be a little wish it was more &quot;virtual&quot; with some of the tasks like cleaning and washing your horse.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|Matt Damon really is one of the best actors of our generation, and the Bourne series (at least the first three installments) is top of the line entertainment.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|A wild, wiggy, great-time!  I was never a fan of the comic growing up but the cast, story and direction really made it feel more real than the wig on Chris Hemsworth's head!
B000FC13UE|3.0|Not my favorite book written by Gaiman, but certainly it has its merits. As I've said in other reviews, it's difficult to rate some of his work due to how good certain of his novels are.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited Candy Crush is finally here for Kindle! Love it! I would play it more if my kids would let me.
0062255657|3.0|I give a three star rating based on how good Gaiman's other novels are. If I didn't have them to compare this one to it might rate even higher. It's a fairly short and easy read. Not your run-of-the-mill, mainstream fiction, but most of his work isn't. And that's a good thing.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show ever!! This season is even more gory and exciting than ever. Love the blood, guts, and rotten brains!!! Great entertainment.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I really like this app. You can pick and choose your own subject matter. Nice interface and fun to navigate through. You almost don't need any other apps if you have this one!
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I am so glad I went ahead and bought this CD.  I have all Celine's CD's and I have to say so far this is my favorite one. She is so talented!!!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This is actually a pretty good movie. Certainly better than I expected it to be. But the best thing is that it doesn't contradict with, and thus interfere in my love of the movie it's based on, the classic Wizard of Oz.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting book with many twists and turns.  The end left you wanting more.  Good for almost all ages from preteen to adult.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Not a bad movie, but nothing outstanding either. Nice look and a good idea, but it's just lacking something. Maybe for me it'll be one of those movies that is better the second time I watch it.
0071762345|5.0|A truly wonderful read for anyone that works in the field of sales and marketing. I currently work in college athletics in marketing and sales and given the constant change, strive to be unique, and push to sell, this book helped me discover a path through it all. This book is clearly written and provides real examples that demonstrate the discussed ideas.<br /><br />It was refreshing to consistently be reinforced to think as the consumer and to be given a simple line to work by - Be Likeable!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|It's not often that movies in a series are as good or better than the first, but all of the Borne movies are fantastic. Good acting, good story, and lots of action. Really better than most action flicks.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is finally on kindle been waiting for ever to get this game this game definitely deserves 5 stars
B006G3JPWO|4.0|Classic Halloween movie that - thanks to my daughter - I've seen at least a dozen times. Entertaining and safe for the kids. What more can you ask for?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it but it is confusion because they don't show you how to even play The game I mean who would do that?
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Very enjoyable movie and very well done. I'm an adult but I really liked it - so it's not just for kids. Very nice to look at too on a good HD TV.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app over all is good but I really wish they could make it so we can post pictures in comments and such
B0063HBPH6|5.0|How would you feel if you were a supernatural being enjoying the XX century on Earth when Heaven and Hell decide it's time to bring on the Apocalypse? Angel Aziraphale enjoys his bookshop on Earth very much and after so many centuries of companionship he even learnt to appreciate the bon vivant demon Crowley. In this way, they are both very disappointed to learn that the Antichrist was born and that in eleven years' time the Earth will be destroyed. Since they both believe they know more about humans than their counterparts (above and below), they take it to themselves to try and stop the Armageddon. But the Antichrist seems to be missing and people, being people, are not keen on letting the Earth go just yet.<br /><br />I've loved this book since the first time I read it so many years ago and it's amazing that it keeps growing on me. Maybe knowing the story helps to savour each paragraph more each time. The writing style is very Pratchett but the core of the story is very Gaiman - there's no way these two together could go wrong. The book is hilarious and you'll find yourself laughing out loud or trying to read passages out loud to people that have no idea of what you're talking about - it is that good. And maybe while reading this story you'll learn something about caring for our planet and humankind. Maybe.<br /><br />\\"And there never was an apple, in Adam's opinion, that wasn't worth the trouble you got into for eating it.\\"
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game. I just wish it was easier to get the chips in order to continue to play. I run out to quickly.
B005MYEPXC|4.0|Amazing film!  I loved it so much that I had to go to Paris just to see some of the sites.  One of Woody Allen's best films (Yes, up there with classics like &#34;Manhattan&#34; and &#34;Annie Hall&#34;).  Beautiful cinematography, directing, acting, and music.  Funny and poignant.  Fans who love Woody Allen will like it, and it will surely convert new fans as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of bonus features on the disc.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|I never could see it from my purchase because it was in a loop that kept telling me I had to download Adobe Flash even though I had done that multiple times.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|This review will probably be removed, but you can find this in an 11 lb bag elsewhere online for about $10 more than the 2.2 lb bag (including very minimal flat rate shipping).  Just search for 11 lb Kinetic Sand.  Why not get 5 times as much for an extra 10 bucks?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I WILL recommend this book to all those ACTION SEEKERS ! I thought the ENDING was BEAUTIFUL, although many think otherwise... And OF COURSE this book is at the TOP of my FAVORITE BOOKS list ! :)
B003VS0CYC|5.0|All three films look great, very clear and crisp sound, the third film is the weakest of the three but hey it's still RoboCop.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Nice app I would recommend to all kids who like angry birds and temple run very similar concept and a very nice non violent game for kids & all kids that love angry birds would like this
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I had been wanting to see this movie since it was released in theaters but never made it. One night my friend and I were having movie night and I suggested Now You See Me. She had seen it before but said she would definitely see it again. I enjoyed watching the story develop and was completely thrown off at the end. It left me speechless and wondering what just happened. So, I bought it to watch it again! One heck of a good movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Amazing app for all kids and adults who have to wake up early in the morning and have a rough time getting up. This alarm is very loud and has auto repeat that makes sure you get up. And If you are a deep sleeper I would definitely recommend this to you.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|This set is a 'must have' for any true fan of RTF.  I had the privilege of seeing this version of the group in concert and even though I went with the feeling that Al Di Meola's absence might make the music seem incomplete, I couldn't have been more wrong.  Frank Gambale's interpretations were right on and let's face it; with the addition of Jean-Luc Ponty to the lineup, how can this not work?
B004VOBIE8|4.0|Cool not better than file manager free the too best file managers on the amazon market its a very great app I would recommend to all kindle users
B009CVRQLY|3.0|This album is good. That is it. It is just good. Not brilliant, not excellent. Just good. Her albums in the last decade were a disappointment and though this one is better than taking chances, it's not better by much. It's like she has lost all guidance when it comes to her proven vocal talents. It's almost disrespectful that she used to give it her all and now that we have become fans and spent the money that she sounds like she doesn't care as much. And, she may care but the lack of good production in the studio makes her songs sound quite similar to one another. Loved me back to life, the single, is a gem. The rest of the songs are mediocre at best. I wouldn't waste time listening to them again. All except for LMBTL. Sorry Celine. I love you..but, you can do much better. And you have let your real fans down, not just the leg humpers who would never dare say anything against you.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Amazing game I would recommend to all users who love throwing things at each other. Its a hey fun game no violence and runs very smooth with no lags or shuts downs.
B000HF0ILY|3.0|I'll try to make this one quick as I tend to get long winded.  This movie ,to me at least, seemed like Dirty Harry's great grandfather comes to mining town and does what the Callahans do best, throw in a little &#34;High Pains Drifter&#34; for good measure.  You get the idea?  I didn't really feel for the down trodden miners,nor their annoying women.  I didn't think the bad guys were really very good bad guys. &#34;is that a spoonerism?&#34; Haveing John Russell as the really bad guy marshall was a bit of a coup, as he was a &#34;Lawman&#34; in the 1958 tv series by that name. I think he might have been in &#34;Maverick&#34; too?  I think the dog that got shot is the real reason the &#34;Preacher&#34; played by Eastwood, went after the bad guys.  Those wimpy, whiney, miners certanly could not?<br />  This movie has an old plot with no really original add ons to freshen it up and lots of annoying miners
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Nice app very similar too samurai vs zombie defense 2 I would recommend this game to all kids who like ninjas and zombies. Game has no lags and shut downs this app is amazing.
B0014J8D9Q|4.0|This is the best of Eastwood's westerns. This is the first one that I didn't feel like I was watching Dirty Harry's great grandfather or the return of the Highplains Drifter.  Of course that is my opinion and I'm entitled to it.  In this movie Eastwood has gotten the period mostly correct, not only in clothing but speech and how people felt, reacted, to and about things in the era in which the film takes place.  The ever increasing injuries to the Prostitute as the story gets told over and over, I think this was common at a time when word of mouth was the only way news traveled.  I believe it to be true that a lot of bad men were bad men when they were drunk and maybe not quite so bad when they weren't. I think very few movies have ever touched on how much alcohol played a part in making brave men. Not only the bad ones but the good ones too.  This movie deals with the act of killing someone like few westerns before it ever had. It's not glamourous to kill someone as Jaimz Woolvett's charactor discovered.  Eastwood's portrayal of Will Munny is, I think one of his best.  Gene Hackman's &#34;Little Bill&#34; charactor is a far account of how a lot of so called lawmen really were, and Hackman manages to really make you dislike &#34;Little Bill&#34;.<br />  I'm a stickler for period correctness and it often means a lot to me when a director takes the time to get things as right as they can make it.  Eastwood did a really great job on this film, &#34;getting things right&#34; not just the period but his actors as well.<br />  Just so you know this is not a movie for young'ens or those offended by off color language.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a amazing app. I would recommend this game to all adults who like bejeweled or bubble pop this game is a very must get. This have become the most popular game for all Facebook users and for all people over the world.
B001H4NXCK|4.0|This is just a fun movie that doesn't take itself too serious. Everybody seems like they are having fun, and thats, I think, the way to take this movie.<br />  I think this movie is one that a family could enjoy together no really bad language, no nude bits or anything like that, oh wait I think you might see Gibson's butt while he is dressed like an indian. That I think is it?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game and very addictive game and I would recommend to all kids who love temple run and has the same concept and is very similar to temple run. I play this all the time and it has no lag or shut downs
B003K16PFU|4.0|Orwell conveys perfectly the atmosphere of northeastern Spain during the brief civil war at the end of the thirties and the passion that drew men to fight what they hoped to be the battle which would end the spread of Fascism.  He describes the boredom punctuated by brief ineffectual violence that characterized his time at the stationary front between Barcelona and Zaragosa, the lack of meaning of events when seen up close compared to the illusion of purposeful action explained from afar, based on rumor and propaganda.  Most of all, he exposes the disregard for truth and military advantage in the manipulation of every opportunity by Moscow puppeteers and their followers to leave the Communist Party the last group standing, whatever the outcome of the struggle.<br /><br />Orwell is very repetitious and the book began to feel like a very large 171 pages.  The ending evolves quickly and strangely, however, with Orwell and his English buddies finding they can best escape from ignominious imprisonment, possible death, by merely exchanging their tattered battle rags for the garb and manners of oblivious English tourists.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Nice game would definitely recommend to all users. Amazing app the best first person shooter game includes an amazing storyline which has a good amount of missions. Has multiplayer which is amazing this game had no lag at all and no shut downs it runs very smooth
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing book!  I purchased this because I was extremely interested in the previews that came out for the movie.<br /><br />I will not give a book summary here but I want to say that this gives an amazing insight into the human mind.  It illuminates how we (mankind) typically think.<br /><br />Memorable quote:<br />&#34;Humanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us to be brilliant on its behalf.&#34;<br /><br />You should read this before seeing the movie!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Fun game amazingly fun never gets boring always a game to look forward too playing. Amazing game for all users. I would recommend to kids especially who like zombies
1250037751|4.0|I picked this book up on a whim at a Barnes and Noble because a review on the back mentioned trap doors. I'm a sucker for trap doors. This is basically a book for people who are in love with books. Old books. Secret books. Books in general. It immediately drew me into its mysteries. It made me want more secrets in my life. I wanted my secrets to have secrets. The writing style and content is very contemporary and will appeal the current generation of tech savvy bibliophiles. It definitely has an ideal target audience.<br />If you love books, the internet, can get excited about things like fonts, and possibly have a childhood that may or may not have involved fantasy role playing games, this is definitely the book for you. If you fall into even a couple of those categories, it's still pretty good. If you don't like any of those things, you're probably going to hate it.<br />Overall I really enjoyed the read. I put it down for a little in the middle because I got distracted by another book, but picked it back up because there was always enough mystery to draw me back in. I needed to see how it ended. The ending didn't blow me away but I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the whole read and I think it was well worth my time and money.
B0086700CM|5.0|Cool game I would recommend this to all users who played the temple run 2 game and hasn't tried out a running and adventurous game. This game has a great concept.

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|THIS ROCKS!!!! WOW from the first song, REVELATION on this CD just rocks. first thing I though was wow they have not missed a beat. This sounds like them in their prime in the 80s the music rips and the singing is spot on, if anything its ever heavier. I feel like I have went back in time. No More Hell To Pay, Saved by Love, Jesus is Just alright (a cover of the old Dobbie Brothers song and a Heavy cover at that, Very cool), The One (is the Power Ballard on the album very melodic and heavy), Legacy, Marching into battle (Very Heavy cool melodic Guitar lick hear), Te Amo, Sticks & Stones, Water into Wine, Sympathy (just rocks probably my favorite on the Album along with Revelation and No More Hell To Pay), and lastly Renewed it rocks. Every song rocks. This is a must get for all Stryper fans, you will not be disappointment. I think its the best metal album of 2013.
B007N85POS|5.0|Amazing app I would recommend this app to all users who like angry birds and has a very great concept. I would recommend this app to all users definitely kids.

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|When Eminem first announced the title of his upcoming album in August by way of a clever advertisement, I had qualms and was concerned that he had made a mistake. How could he make a sequel to his most highly acclaimed work, especially after releasing \\"Recovery\\", an entire album that chronicled a maturing Eminem and showcased the destruction of a drug addiction that fueled a majority of \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\"'s content? He even dyed his hair blonde again. Was this going to be a truthful return to a magnum opus, or was it a middle-aged man's last attempt to stay relevant in an evolving genre that now prides itself more on fashion than it does lyrics? I pondered this briefly and felt that he had made a mistake. As the singles were slowly released, I was pleased but not appeased. I found them enjoyable but did not see how they were in line with the content from \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". Then, on October 14, 2013, \\"Rap God\\" was released and it derailed all of my lingering preconceived notions. The track evinces a wild-throwback to the original \\"Mathers\\". Not only does it feature tantalizing wordplay, a ridiculously fast verse, and a versatile repertoire of lyrics, it is littered with homophobic and misogynistic lyrics, features that were heavily prevalent on the original. I don't mean to condone these lyrics, however, they were rather satisfying in the sense that they truly alluded to just how far Eminem went back. They're art and not mean to be taken literally. Additionally, there are references to the original album strewn all over the song; the opening introduction features the same words as \\"Remember Me\\", he repeats the Columbine line (uncensored this time) from \\"I'm Back\\" and the rest of the song features other blasts to the past. I was feeling much more confident for the direction of the album after the release of \\"Rap God\\"<br /><br />All of my feelings were cemented further when I heard the rest of the album. This is his best one in years. I can't even beginto describe how blown away I was by it, and it sounds even better with each listen. For one, he isn't just a talented lyricist anymore like he was back in 2000. In addition to still being the best lyricist in contemporary hip-hop, he's also become quite the king of metaphors. Though this crown may have rested on Lil Wayne's head for a (well-earned) period of time, it's easily been shifted to Eminem's. The amount of double entendres (\\"How could I not blow, all I do is drop F-bombs?\\" and \\"If I can't 'batter' the women, how the f--- am I supposed to bake them a cake, then?\\" are just a few), metaphors, similes, rhyme scheme and sheer wordplay propels him to tip-top form, as he shouts on the album's magnificent closer, \\"Evil Twin\\".<br /><br />My concerns as to whether or not this would be a throwback were swiftly alleviated the instant I realized what was going on in the seven minute opener, \\"Bad Guy\\"; Stan's younger brother, Matthew, has returned and is hellbent on slaughtering Eminem for causing the death of Stan. One of the best tracks I've ever heard, and the lyricism here is pretty startling at times. If this wasn't enough, the skit that follows this, \\"Parking Lot\\", picks up immediately where the bank-robbery skit in \\"Criminal\\" left off--Eminem shoots and kills the teller, and darts into the parking lot, attempting to evade the oncoming onslaught of police. The rest of the album is laden with throwbacks and references each copacetic in its own right. Even frequent longtime collaborator Luis Resto is back at work, and while his absence was duly noted, his return is generously welcomed. The track \\"So Far\\" incorporates interpolations of both \\"I'm Back\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" directly into the verses. Another track has him pondering his longevity in the game when his rivals seem to have vanished (\\"I'm all out of wack/I'm out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack\\") while a track on the deluxe edition has him tossing out ICP member Violent J's name. Yet another track has Eminem spewing, \\"I'm still a criminal/ten year old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals/the last Mathers went diamond, I'm predicting this one'll go emerald!\\" Meanwhile, at least two tracks (one featuring label mate Kendrick Lamar) are entirely dedicated to the grotesque brand of misogyny that made him the archenemy of feminist groups worldwide. The deluxe edition even closes with Ken Kaniff!<br /><br />However, and perhaps most interesting, is the fact that despite the album's retrospective outlook, it still manages to remain undeniably fresh and new. None of the tracks sound recycled or unoriginal, even ones that seem to be direct continuations of songs from the first LP. In addition, he continues to touch upon familiar subject matter (his father's departure, his wrestling with fame, his addiction, etc.) in a new light, still retaining the content that makes his sales soar while opting for original sounds and delivery. He's a 41 year old man who still has a story to tell and can still do so remarkably well, with an effervescent style that still lurks when other mainstream artists have gravitated towards braggadocios displays of wealth and inept characterizations of their sexual escapades. We still want to listen, we're still interested and we still stay put.<br /><br />Overall, this was a phenomenal album. You don't even need to be a die-hard Eminem fan to appreciate it. If you just compare this to recent offerings from the likes of 2 Chainz, A$AP Rocky, Drake and even J.Cole, this blows them all out of the water. The beats are better, the content better, the lyrics better and the feel of the album better. For those of us, like myself, who have been fans of his for over a decade or more, this will be even more enjoyable as his material will resonate with us more soundly. For instance, the moving track \\"Headlights\\" features a powerful apology to his mother, who he's been insulting since \\"My Name Is\\" all the way down to \\"My Mom\\" from \\"Relapse\\". We've journeyedwith him and listened to the tale of his mother for enough time that this track will be particularly hard hitting.<br /><br />I urge you to buy this album. It's the best release of the past few years, and though I may be a bit biased since I am a huge fan of his, I'm also not oblivious--if he made an awful album, I'd be the first to call him out as I did when \\"Encore\\" was released, even though its sub par lyrical content was still better than that of most other artists. Thankfully he didn't make an awful album and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\\" is an extremely worthy successor to a predecessor that introduced millions to Slim Shady. Speaking of Slim Shady, the closing song, \\"Evil Twin\\" is a devilishly devised track in which Eminem and Shady trade jabs at one another, and the rest of the track consists of raw, pure, unadulterated Slim Shady at his finest. The critics have agreed with my assessment, lauding the album with rave reviews, while only a select few are criticizing it for its homophobia and misogyny, to which Elton John aptly responded, \\"If they aren't intelligent enough to see his intelligence, that's their problem.\\"<br /><br />I'll close with a minute comment; I'm not sure why he didn't include the deluxe tracks on the standard version. They're all good enough to have made it, and I would've swapped one of them out for a track like \\"Stronger Than I Was\\" which I wasn't too fond of. Nevertheless, enjoy!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Good file explorer one of the best file explorer on the market amazing file explorer best for all kindle users. I would also recommend to users that need to find all there files.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Everyone loves solitaire and it's easy to learn with this electronic version. You'll never have to play 52 pickup because all the &#34;cards&#34; are electronic. I use it on my Kindle Fire and can play anywhere, anytime.

B0090X4GLW|5.0|While it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, the sound track to Pitch Perfect is delightful to listen to. The a capella singing is absolutely wonderful! The CD arrived just a couple of days after it was ordered and we are enjoying it very much.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Really liked the structure organized around common problems and solutions for remote work. If you weren't convinced before you read this book, you'll have the ammo to give a good go. Well worth your time and money!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is great, I jumped from a weightless mouse to this and I loved it. I admit that with all the weights in it didn't feel as heavy as I thought it would but nonetheless it gets the job done, the light is pretty cool, adds to the aesthetic appeal. and the software to assign macros is pretty usefull. Overall it's worth 40 bucks, the only thing i didn't like about it is the adjusting the sensitivity throught the button, I prefer the software to fine tune it.
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|I really wanted to like this, but no dice.  Remixes and do-overs are two different things.  There is NO trace of Donna on Working the Midnight Shift.  Instant fail.
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|[[ASIN:B008GT83FG The First Confessor (The Legend of Magda Searus)]]By Terry Goodkind<br /><br />This is good read for lovers of fantasy and magic.  The novel involves a conflict betwwen the new world and old world empire ruled by Emperor Sulachan, who is thoroughly evil.  Magna Searus is one of the ungifted though married to the First Wizard, who has died (an apparent suicide) as the book opens.  Magna lives in the capitol city of Aydindril which contains the Keep, a fortress for the wizards and the government of the new world.<br /><br />The character of Magna is finely crafted.  I enjoyed reading of her struggles to uncover a plot of traitors.  The only drawback is the author could've foreshadowed events more and given readers a chance to anticipate the sudden plot twists.  Too often the author must explain things after their occurance.  Otherwise, this is a wothwhile buy.  The character of Magna will grab your interest throughout.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I really enjoy Mr. Gladwell's books.  This books is no exception.  Recommend it for anyone looking for a thought provoking, easy to read book.

B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed each of the books in the Nikki Heat series. Start looking for the next one as soon as I finish the one I'm reading. I love that the characters are both strong and vulnerable at the same time. Enjoy!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ok so if you read the first two books, you really don't have much of a choice and you have to purchase the third. That's what happened to me. So the first two books were great, totally went out and pre-ordered the third. What a nightmare-the book did not seem very well thought out  (sorry I'm not an author so I shouldn't criticize-but this is a review and review I must). All I can say is that there were too many uprisings.....too many conspiracies. I loved that the ending was not neatly all wrapped up in a bow, so there is that (it's a better ending than say Mockingjay), but getting to the ending was actually painful. I forced myself to finish the book-and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Simply downloads and stores YouTube videos. Indispensable for those with slower internet connection and want to see higher resolution videos.
B0043M56Y6|5.0|The book brings the user into the realm of 3D development on iOS in the best way possible, via well documented tutorials.  Often the learner is presented with two possibilities in developing the applications:<br />1) Use the standard X-Code wizard to skip basic admin steps<br />2)  Start from a bare bones project, allowing the learner to see even the mundane details (I enjoyed this approach)<br />The book has aged well, as the bulk of the tutorials do not rely on the interface builder, but rather directly using OpenGL ES (1 and 2).  So much so, that the concepts used within are readily applicable to Android as well.  Using C++ for the rendering engine rather than objective-C is a great help here, too. The tutorials are detailed and adaptable enough that I was able to modify a few of them to new purposes with little effort, such as coding shaders for General Purpose GPU coding (using the GPU to compute non graphics data).
B006ZZAN60|5.0|visually stunning,the audio is outstanding.would encourage anyone who loves good music to get this one.no matter what your taste in music

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|One of the greatest rappers ever to pen a verse! this cd is no different everything from dealing with his own rise to fame to his fallout with his mom and everything in between. Might not be the strongest cd from him musically but lyrically it will stand up to most. I really like most the tracks on it. even if you're a slight fan its got something to offer you.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Gravity can be summed in just one sentence it is  one of the best films I have seen this year or in many years. But there is so much to write about it that I cannot stop at one line.<br />Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission,\\" says astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) as he continues to joke around cruising around in jetpacks 370 miles above earth. The first scenes are incredible as the planet earth lies beneath the space shuttle while three engineers Dr. Ryan Stone ( Sandra Bullock) are tethered to it while doing patch up work on the Hubble telescope while talking to mission control played by Ed Harris- the sound effects on the dialogues are incredible.<br />Planet Earth never looked so beautiful and so is the long shot of the space shuttle slowly edging on to view and in 3D, one can feel the isolation, stillness and the soundlessness of space.<br />I have yet to see the making of the movie and I will but I think it would be a lot of people spending countless hours on special effects.<br />Gravity is a science fiction film with many scientific inaccuracies,  for example although Russians and Chinese have their space missions in roughly the same locality as the US missions it is not easy to get to their missions in space with jetpacks as shown in the film. There are other doubtable scenes but most people would hardly care for these inaccuracies as the magic is in the presentation about space and also about human loss and pain, isolation, the futility of life and in the perseverance to fight for its last breath.<br />I was surprised to find myself reacting so strongly at many moments in the film, even though the movie is only 131 minutes long......it keeps you in its grip for the entire duration suspended in gravity and riveted by the disaster that unfolds before your eyes. The happenings strike you again and again and stay with you.<br />As debris from a Russian space explosion hurls towards them, they are asked by mission control to abort their task and get back into the shuttle. As disaster strikes leaving people dead and leaving Stone and Kowalski stranded in space- the special effects are just amazing here.<br />I am not going to tell you what happens from this point but will point out that amidst the background of the CGI effects is the most moving human performance by Sandra Bullock. Just watch her in the communication with a greenlandic fisherman named on Earth's surface,  using a ham radio and feel tears coming out of your eyes...or in the final scenes. A performance of a lifetime. I think the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and Sandra Bullock are the stars of the film.<br />Do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest IMAX screen that you can see it on. You won't be disappointed....five stars. 10/18/2013and get back into the shuttle.

B003VS0CWO|5.0|I didn't realize I bought the Blu-ray. I'm really glad I did. Picture and sound quality is amazing. The picture book that is included is pretty nice. Great gift for any fan.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The first Chapter was so scary. It then moved a long at a good pace. I think it was a good follow up to the Shining . It answered many questions without spoon feeding it to the reader.
B0000032LS|5.0|The sound quality is very good. The disc came in great shape. A really good buy for any fan of the movie.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|With beautiful art style, addictive gameplay, and extremely good replay value, this is a must have for anyone who loves a fun game.
B0072NWJRK|2.0|This book is very slow going and I only got through half of it before I gave up. I may get back to it but I doubt it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Picked these books up immediately after I read 50 shades. Wish I'd never read 50 shades. Ms. Day is such a much more talented writer and she puts you in a position where you are seeing the things she is describing and feeling what her characters are feeling, there is angst, anxiety, turmoil, excitement, and all the other good adjectives that I can't think of right now.  I've read all three books from this series, I think the first two were better than the third but I really liked them all. I will absolutely read more of Ms. Day's work.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Good plot,but did not live up to all the advertising hype. I wish I had waited until it came out for rental.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product. Still alittle limited to content but has tons of potential.  Well worth the $$$$. wifi works great and picture quality is awesome.
B0047SKR54|4.0|Really good movie! Only reason for 4stars is because I thought the ending could've been a little better. Overall very good will watch again.
006202406X|2.0|I give the final installment of the Divergent series a 2/5 not because of the ending alone (don't worry, I won't ruin it) but because of all the writing leading up to it. In the previous two books, Roth has created an engaging and dynamic world which has recently been upended by a great revelation. Allegiant sadly does not do justice to what should have been a climactic finale. Here is what went wrong:<br /><br />The two viewpoints where essentially the same: We see the story from both Tris and Tobias'  point of view in this novel. The trouble is, Roth does nothing make the characters different; if it weren't for the chapter headings you would not know who was speaking. Their thoughts and manner of thinking are virtually identical, and their personalities get muffled by the writing which comes across as a tad immature. In other works, multiple viewpoints often enhance the story and allow you to see the situation from multiple perspectives and get inside different people's heads. Tris and Tobias may as well be one in the same.<br /><br />The writing was subpar: I feel like an entirely different Veronica Roth wrote this book. The writing became immature and the plot lost its intrigue quite quickly. I felt as though a teenage shadow-writer was behind this book, as it was the sort of writing one might find in a high school english class attempting to write a Twilight-style novel. While the novels have always been told through the eyes of teens, the writing has felt like that of an adult up until this point. I was left frustrated by the sudden deterioration of quality.<br /><br />The ending: No spoilers I promise. But I can think of a million better ways to end this series which would have achieved effectively the same outcome without the reader feeling disheartened and like they just wasted several hours of their life.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Stop reading the series after Insurgent and make your own ending. I promise you, you will be much happier if you do.
B00637HXNG|5.0|First !!! I'm a collector of live shows on dvd for many years of all types of music . I ordered this blue ray dvd and recieved it way before the delivery date stated (awesome) . Now after viewing this on my home theater on my 55 inch lcd tv .through my sony over 1000 watts of power system I tollally enjoyed the show . Note this dvd does play through my tv even that it isn't 3D  ...It is Fu#$en  awesome tour ,one of the best dvd blue ray dvd show I have ever seen and the sound is striking clear ..Hell it is better seats to this show then going there live ,this is one dvd if you love the scorpions ,you need to have in your collection ..Now I want to buy a 3d tv because I'm sure it kicks butt even more seeing it in 3D ..

B00C3ALLZ8|4.0|Very funny premise that falls flatly into the Thames River.<br /><br />Great performances built around wobbly scenes leaves you wondering about who put up the cash.<br />I would imagine that a significant amount of tax was deducted from the producers' incomes.<br />Now it's back as a write-off for those same estates.<br /><br />All smartly managed celebrities make these types of films.  Lately, a large group of celebrities put in for a similar type film: THIS IS THE END.  They can be packed with great stuff but generally fall flat in the storytelling.  I have to add that there MAY be a POSSIBLE intent to produce a loser..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Of course, I was one to laugh at all the other people who were addicted to this game. Now, I cannot get enough! Go ahead, laugh!
B0000073NC|5.0|Happy to see this record back in circulation. I listen to this often, and as recently as the day before yesterday.<br /><br />I purchased the original vinyl when it was released back in the 70s. I found a CD copy about 5 years ago from a place that sells second hand CDs online. I spent years trying to match Ulrich's tone on this record and finally succeeded with an American Deluxe Strat into a Bogner Shiva. I believe that the Marshalls used on this record were hot rodded by Rheinhold.<br /><br />The guitar playing is phenomenal. This carried over into In Trance and Virgin Killer and after that I gave up on the Scorps and Judas Priest because they became way too commercial.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I went into this book with high expectations. They were not quite met. Rothfuss is a very good writer and manages to create some truly memorable characters.  The reason I can't give the book five stars is the main character. Kvothe is completely unlikable. Arrogant, hyperintelligent, essentially his biggest weakness is that he is too good at everything.

1843106698|5.0|Tony Attwood is an English psychologist living in Australia who has made Asperger’s Syndrome his major study and clinical practice.  This is one of six books he has written on the subject.  Liane Holliday Willey, who has now written books about Asperger’s herself, says of Attwood,  “Dr. Attwood, or Saint Tony as I call him, gave me the strength to come out to the world and admit I was only pretending to be normal. That strength saved my life, of that I am certain.”<br /> In this book he defines Asperger’s and explains how it is diagnosed; then he goes into a number of chapters on the characteristics of those with Asperger’s Syndrome.  I have a daughter with AS and these helped me to understand her better.  He discusses  their limitations in social understanding and making friends; how and why they are often the subject of teasing and bullying; their inability to understand others’ facial expressions and their feelings; their tendency to be high in some cognitive abilities and low in others, causing unrealistic expectations to be placed on them; their confusion and immaturity with regard to feelings; and their sensitivity to sounds, textures, tastes, and light.  The book is quite readable and certainly recommended if you are on the syndrome or personally related to someone who is.  Or if you suspect you might be.<br /> In explaining challenges this syndrome presents, Attwood says, “Sometimes people with Asperger’s Syndrome assume that a friendly act, smile or gesture has greater implications than was intended, and this may lead to the development of an intense interest or infatuation with a person who appears kind and friendly.”  Also, “They are often perfectionists with high self-imposed standards of achievement, and  . . . are notorious for their inability to cope with frustration.”  Their sensory sensitivity is such that sounds that others hardly notice can be almost unbearable, hugs are often experienced as unpleasant, and aromas of perfumes or cleaning products can cause nausea.  Though Attwood emphasizes the areas where those on the AS need to work, he clearly delights in his clients and the creativity they bring to life with their differences.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I very much disliked this app. I didn't like that there was an ad on the notion of the screen, the screen layout, or how it showed my notifications. Not a fan!
B00G725UZA|5.0|The centerpiece of this album is “Love Is Lost (Hello Steve Reich Mix by James Murphy for the DFA).”  “Love is Lost” was, in my opinion, the best track on Next Day, harkening back to the classic Bowie sound of Let’s Dance. Remixes can go one of two ways, they enhance the original track or they ruin it. James Murphy’s (of LCD Soundsystem)remix clearly enhances “Love is Lost.” Including a techno dance beat while retaining the original sound and energy of the original, while adding a nice sprinkle of “Ashes to Ashes” (yep, you read it right, “Ashes to Ashes”).  The publishers of the album have smartly made the “Love is Lost” remix an album only track.<br /><br />That’s not to say there is nothing else to recommend here. “Atomica,” “The Informer,” “Like a Rocket Man,” “Born in a UFO,” and “God Bless the Girl” are new tracks which are not available on the “Next Day” or the deluxe edition.  Of these, “The Informer” is one of the weaker new tracks and “God Bless the Girl”(which was previously only available on the Japanese version of the Next Day) is one of the best.  There is also an additional remix of “I’d Rather Be High.”

B005LAIIGW|5.0|**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**<br /><br />Gravity will grab you by the throat and will not let go. It is basically a 90 minute climax of the tensest, scariest, most beautiful film you've seen in your whole life. There is not a single moment where you can relax or let your guard down - just moments where Cuar&oacute;n lets you breathe in between moments of utter, gut-clenching, brutal terror.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00F4YKCFA Sandra Bullock]] gives an incredible, physical, emotional powerhouse of a performance, that can only be described as absolutely extraordinary. George Clooney is calming and reassuring in that way that only George Clooney can be. I really have nothing bad to say about this movie. It is perfect in almost every way.<br /><br />For instance, in the way it subtly echoes sci-fi classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stone's fetal position while floating weightless), WALL-E (Fire extinguisher propulsion), and Apollo 13 (Ed Harris's casting as Houston). In the way the score by Steven Knight is the most dread-inspiring, terrifying, and ethereal score of the year.<br /><br />The cinematography - which is utterly, utterly perfect. Absolutely, transcendentally, ethereally, stunningly, hauntingly gorgeous. This will make your jaw drop. The camera work and the long takes are the most stunning I have ever seen. There is nothing to compare it to - this is unbridled, no-limits, risky, dangerous film-making at  it's most daring heights. The way Gravity captures the utter emptiness of space, the utter helplessness of humans in that great vacuum is perfect. If you had any childhood dreams of being an astronaut, Gravity will make you rethink them. Twice.<br /><br />The scientific accuracy, including the lack of sound in space and the temperatures, the costumes - so real you think Cuar&oacute;n burgled NASA's locker rooms for the film - adds another gritty sense of realism to the cold beauty of space. Bullock's magnetic and beautiful performance as a woman who finds herself and confronts her demons in the middle of the worst crisis that can befall a human (alone, zero oxygen, drifting 300 miles above Earth) carries the film with single-handed aplomb. This is Sandra Bullock as you have _never_ seen her.<br /><br />Really, I'm just gushing here. Go see Gravity, on the biggest screen you can find, preferably in 3D, with blaring volume. Get ready to get thrilled, chilled, terrified, moved, and have your jaw dropped by one of the great talents of our time, [[ASIN:B000QGAU4E Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n]], and the greatest film of 2013 so far: Gravity. This film deserves to rank with the greats. This is like nothing you have ever seen, so don't miss out on the opportunity of the lifetime! Oh and one more thing...<br /><br />\\"I hate space.\\"demons in the middle of the worst crisis that can befall a human (alone, zero oxygen, drifting 300 miles above Earth) carries the film with single-handed aplomb.

B00BAXFECK|1.0|There comes a point where litetary description becomes just plain boring.  This novel finds that point again and again.  Long past the point of interest, the scene finally changes. Although, the sadness does not.  Glacial speed and tragedy do not necessarily make a Dickensian epic.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|Pick up kevin hearn if you like Neil Gaiman too, but about this book it really kept me going and had great turns.  my 1st Gaiman book but loved him in Sandman back in the 90's.  Will read more.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Disappointed with the apps that will work with the device.  Works fine with Youtube and Netflix, but that is about it.  Wanted a device that I could project my browser onto a TV.  This device is great, but is incredibly limited by its lack of compatibility with almost any app.  Very disappointed.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Was alitte strange to follow for a first book.  Had the normal Sanderson magic, but wasn't one of my favorties.  Still a solid read if you like modern day fantasy.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|The app works as it is supposed to - it's all I really expect.<br />If it works as advertised, then it has won me over.<br />Hope it works the next time I go to use it....
B0086449YA|3.0|I really like MK at his best, but a lot of what he has put out in recent years feels like retreads.  My sympathy to his plight.  Tough to keep coming up with new and interesting tunes.  I keep buying, wanting to be rewarded.  He has, over the years, put out songs of amazing sensitivity, interest, and of course, great sound.  Just didn't feel like this was anywhere near his best.  Got to pay bills and keep busy, I guess.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|After visiting Mike Matthews site and reading a few posts I really enjoyed the content.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />After committing to a small purchase of 6.99 (Price of a Chipotle Burrito) for the kindle edition of his book Bigger Leaner Stronger, I became even more enthralled with Mike's writing. There is one main reason I like the book and that's digestible content. Easy to read and easy to understand; Mike takes the time to define terms that most authors expect one to know. The book takes you step by step on how to lift smarter, harder, and eat better to achieve the results you are looking for. I especially like how the book debunks many of the fallacies associated with ridiculous amounts of sets, drop sets, and over exertion to the point of failure.<br /><br />Another piece that I like about this book is that it has a voice. Many times when reading fitness books its regimented reading, like your studying for a biology test. Whether Mike knew it or not, he interjected humor in some surprising ways. It felt more like a friend was explaining this information to me instead of reading a manual.<br /><br />Lastly I enjoy the immediate support I received from Mike himself. After visiting his website I immediately received a personalized email from him, after submitting my own email address. I've communicated with the guy.... I've never been to a fitness website, or read a fitness book, where I've had direct contact with the author.<br /><br />For what its worth, I've already noticed gains in the gym from using the simple methodology Mike teaches. Every person is different but this book gives a great road map for success. Now I just have to lay-off the Qdoba.
0385474547|4.0|Good story about trying times. Don't remember whether this is a translation, although I imagine to be.  Books in translation usually tricky in getting feel for author.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I got about, I don't know, three or so chapters into this book, and I couldn't read anymore.  This is totally boring.  I'm not sure what the hype is about.  I really really really wanted to give this book a shot and kept pushing myself to read it and it just got to a point where I couldn't anymore.  I lost total interest. It might be better for younger readers (I'm 24), but it certainly wasn't my kind of story.
B005CAAVVQ|3.0|As an old trombone player, I was excited to read the reviews about this disc and approached it full of positive expectation.  I guess I was disappointed, not by the ability of the playing, but by the somewhat tedious nature of the music he chose.  Sounded too close to techno stuff to me.  A bit on the fluffy side.  I wanted more depth, and didn't get it.  Too bad for me, as I know from the reviews that lots of people out there think he is great.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Great album by one of the best singers in the industry.  It's nice to hear her sing different styles of songs that people wouldn't think fit her.
0316055433|2.0|If anyone out there is planning on reading Donna Tartt’s new book The Goldfinch, let me save you from it. I read over 400 pages of this 750+ page tome before I gave up, convinced it would come of nothing (and I was right). I broke my own rule and jumped to the last chapter and sure enough, the ending was benign. It had me in the first 100 pages, and then meandered into nothing for the rest of the book. Skip it.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Part 2 is upon us.  The queen continues with another classic album.  All hail Janelle Monae.  Good catch for Diddy
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Having started with the TV show, I can see the imprint of the author. It's exciting &funny, and a decent mystery, although it had a few more twists & turns than we're needed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great story from Grisham.  This one will have you scratching your head until it all comes together.  If you have doubts about our Federal prosecutors before you read this book, you will shake your head.  Very interesting.
006202406X|1.0|This book was so poorly written that I couldn't even finish it.  I would constantly forget which character was narrating because they had EXACTLY the same voice.  I hated this book without even reading the ending (which, according to other reviews, sucked -- shocker).<br /><br />This book doesn't even seem like it was written by the same person who wrote the first two.  Just beyond awful.  I want my money back, and you definitely shouldn't waste yours.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story. Great action. Great drama. In light of the rapidly advancing computerization of our world, I found the premise not so outlandish. If you have seen children & teens playing video and computer games you know what I mean. Soldiers are human beings and have emotions, so of course they are going to have regrets and feel sadness not only at the loses of their comrades, but will naturally struggle with the need to kill the enemy. However, when it comes down to it the enemy must be destroyed. War is kill or be killed.  The Earth was attacked twice, but survived. The only appropriate response was to hit back and hit back hard. I found the over-all tone of the book to be patriotic with a real hero to cheer for. If you know the real life Sergeant York story you may see a parallel in Ender.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Do not read anything more if you want to be completely surprised by the ending.<br /><br />Ender's show of mercy (The Queen egg) and his sadness at his total victory over the Buggers is quite normal and realistic. Ender is a true hero. He saved the Earth from a mortal threat and then showed mercy and understanding to his defeated foe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|omega my niece. told me to check this game out and I haven't played. anything else since. this game is the BEST EVER. lug it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga. I'm glad that it was finally available to download on my kindle fire. The best is that it was free. Thank you.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a first impression but just a while out of the box and I love this knife! I have both the BK2's big brothers the BK7 and the BK9. They're the reason I ordered this guy. I would consider the big guys great field knives but better tactical weapons for a variety of reasons than this knife. Not that if this was all I had in close quarters this would be a bad choice but I just like to be able to reach out and touch someone in a fight and prefer a longer blade for that. So...<br /><br />The pros:<br />I just like the way this knife feels in my hand. It has some heft and I like that. It is ergonomically friendly and fits the hand very comfortably. Out of the box this knife was very sharp and took it outside to make a feather stick and it did so effortlessly. Batoned it through a small log with no problem. Still sharp enough to slice paper. This will be my skinner when deer season opens later this month and I would have no problem chopping onions and cutting fresh green beans with this puppy. I also like that the BK series have a tang that extends beyond the handle and is flat in case something needs hammering. For camping or backyard work, this is all you need.<br /><br />The cons:<br />Only one and since I'm just reviewing the knife I'll leave the five stars up or I'd drop this to a four. It's the sheath. It is a nice sheath. Sturdy, will offer tons of protection. However, the knife locks very tightly into it and although there is a place to place your thumb to apply pressure on the sheath to withdraw the knife it is very difficult. Hard to do a rapid, one handed draw on this and for me that is a serious drawback. I'm going to look around for a replacement, I think.<br /><br />Overall, I love this knife and it will be my hunting companion this year. Don't know a Becker I don't like but I REALLY like this knife!

B004LRZ2YC|5.0|This American version of Let The Right One In starts out blaring at you with sirens, lights, screams, blood, and gore. Typical American alterations to the original which opens with and maintains a quiet, eerie feeling throughout most of it, using soft backing music at times, but also using silence to punctuate. This version tries the same with a constant musical score, almost never using silence and sounds to tell the story gently. Instead this remake tries to shove the mood down your throat with the music..Every soft scene has to have soft piano, every sad scene has to have soft strings, every violent scene has to have pounding drums, etc, etc, etc.<br />And of course, for the American audience, we get plenty of profanity added, the middle school bullying is given pseudo-sexual overtones, and drugs added as well.<br />The deepest, most meaningful scenes are reduced to snippets, and the violence, gore, and abuse are prolonged and enhanced.<br />The secondary characters are blurred into caricatures, eliminated completely, or are hashed together. Even the boy's mother becomes blurred, faceless, and almost irrelevant.<br />Personal and community involvement is replaced with 'police authority' in the person of a cop who ignores law, private rights, and simple decency.<br />And Abby's assistant carries out his responsibilities in noisy and deviant ways, losing the humanity that counterpoints his functions in the original. Maybe they tried to make his humanity more apparent with the dialog with Abby,, but they only made him weird and pathetic instead of worn down by time and his actions for her.<br />Even the snow is ignored by this version, mostly, though is attempted to be used a few times. Using it so rarely only leaves it as a portion of the atmosphere, backing, and not the almost living character of the original.<br />I won't go into the continuity errors.<br />Worst of all is the 'flash forward' opening, giving away several major story points that you would pick upfrom the story as it unfolds. No sense in giving the audience a chance to think for themselves, is there?<br />This remake really is a mere shadow of the original.<br />Tepid at times, empty by comparison to the original, and completely Americanized so that you needn't think or look for anything beyond the actors' lines and performances.<br />Both young leads do well enough, but they could take lessons from the ones in the original.<br />All that said, on it's own, and not knowing the original film, this movie isn't bad at all. Especially for an American remake of a classic foreign film.<br />Watch it, then find \\"Let The Right One In\\" and compare for yourself. Amazon has the original available on DVD and Instant Video.
B00FEJIVRQ|1.0|I made this purchase by accident. I have no way of viewing it. I found no way of cancelling this item. I thought I would get it on DVD. I am currently deciding whether to continue to make purchases on Amazon.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|An interesting and moody film. A good example of how music and sound should be used; not blaring at you every second. The quiet moments without music are as moody and evocative as the ones softly backed by the soundtrack. The incidental sounds are nearly dialog at times. The visuals are wonderful. The snow is used almost as a background character. The camera angles and images often speak for themselves.<br />The two young leads are not only competent, but endearing and convincing.<br />The story itself is wonderful. Love story? Dark tale? Coming of age? Friendship? Learning? Loss? Which? All?<br />The only problem are the subtitles. I don't speak the language fluently at all, but even I caught quite a few errors and omissions, and just plain awful translations. But the story gets through even with the bad job on the subtitles.<br />It's an excellent movie, worthy of calling a film instead of a movie.<br />The American remake isn't as good, but itself is worth watching as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first you laugh at the simplicity of this game.....but, within a short period of time you are hopelessly seduced.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|A very quirky, story! \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"set in a bookstore! I loved this book!  You must read it's predecessor, Alex PENUMBRAS, first in order to have the set-up. The author kept me guessing and wanting to find out what was going to happen next! I will admit to just a tad of disappointment in the ending, although the author wrapped it up nicely........I can't even say why I was a bit disappointed, exactly, I guess I had let my imagination get the better of me!<br />  I want to explain the addition of the \\"s\\" to the last name on the prequel book, auto-correct kept adding it, along with capitalizing the entire name, no matter what I tried. Sorry!
1451613512|5.0|One of the best chapters in the book is: \\"The Cold War: Who Started It?\\". Very strong, footnoted evidence is presented that Harry Truman was an uneducated, ignorant Yahoo, easily susceptible to knee-jerk anti-Soviet thinking, and egged on in that direction by his big-business advisors and cronies.<br /><br />Truman had an amazing lack of understanding of the Soviet's motives and always readily jumped to paranoid conclusions. In fact, it was understandable that the Soviets wanted friendly governments NEXT DOOR to them in eastern Europe. They had been attacked by Germany twice in the century by Germans traipsing across Eastern Europe. They lost over 20 million people in WW2 and many more in WW1.<br /><br />Truman did not have to go the confrontational route against the Soviets. Many (such as Henry Wallace and Eleanor Roosevelt) wanted a live and let live approach. The Soviets deserved some empathy and respect after their huge contribution to the WW2 victory. The times Truman believed they were in violation of Yalta were based on misunderstandings by Truman.<br /><br />Truman went contrary to the philosophy of Roosevelt and Henry Wallace, and if not for a procedural gimmick to put Truman on the ticket instead of Wallace in 1944, Wallace would have become President instead of Truman and would probably have avoided the cold war, Korea, Viet Nam, and all that nonsense. That event at the 1944 convention was probably one of the most important events of the rest of the century.
006202406X|4.0|It is really hard for me to write reviews for series enders, because it is sad to leave characters that I have grown to love and invested so much time into. So, this will be short, spoiler free.<br />  I was drawn right back into the world of Tobias and Tris in this bittersweet conclusion to the series. Though I did rush through the middle because it slowed down got too weighty in the middle, it picked right back up.<br />  There were lots of surprises, and things I both expected, dreaded and couldn't wait for.<br />  I loved getting into Four's head and getting his perspective. It was an added bonus in this and gave us some valuable insight.<br />  Tris is as strong as ever, even though she has her flaws, that makes her even more relatable, and easy to like and pull for. She has the recklessness, but also the courage and sacrifice that defines her.<br />  There is non-stop action in this one, tying up loose ends and resolving all of the plots.<br />  OMG. The ending. I am one of the people who are torn. I hate it and saw it coming, but at the same time I love it and think it is fitting. It depends on what moment you ask me.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Fitting and bittersweet trilogy conclusion.

Kriss Kross was making me dance in between. My cousin shows me her new  boom box. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" bursts forth from some unknown dimension and reaches into places I never knew existed in my musical soul. MC Hammer goes in the trash. Vanilla Ice, trashed. I still have the Kriss Kross but don't tell anybody. Thank you Nirvana. Thank you from the depths of my soul.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|I chuckled through this whole book. Everything that happened to drew was brought on by himself. This is his story of how he turned to the dark side. It was well written and moved at a good pace. I was drawn in from the first paragraph. I loved the characters. \\"The bitch\\" was one of my faves. I loved the curse jar too. Kate was a strong female character with some vulnerability. She sure had drew by the you know what. There is lots of male posturing and strong women with lots of hilarious situations. I had a blast reading this one.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Cant go wrong with this author. And again  an amazing story very well written with many plots and twists to keep you hooked to the story. I enjoyed this one all the way to the end. I highly recommend getting this book.
B005C9YZIW|2.0|for some reason BBC saw fit to gimp this version of 30% of its original resolution, in favor of adding special features that should have been present to begin with.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|This historical thriller is right up my alley. As soon as I started reading I couldn't stop. A real page turner. Characters, dialog, and especially the story line is just amazing.<br />This would be great on film.
B002DR3WG2|1.0|You can call me a heathen if you want to, but I had to quit reading this after 15 chapters or so. I just didn't get the point. Now, if someone wants to fill me in on something I missed, I might give it another go.<br />[[ASIN:B00BWJB37M Dream Weaver (Dream Weaver Novels)]]
B003SNKBXW|4.0|I saw Polanski's film of this book several times before reading it.  I really like the story.  The book has more going on which one would expect.<br /><br />I took off one star because the E-Book, while pretty good, has a lot of errors.  My guess is that the electronic version came from an OCR of the printed edition.  There are a lot of kerning errors.  A simple spell check would have eliminated most of those but some formed valid words that were wrong.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My daughter and I were so anxious to get this book that we accidentally got a large type version. Collins has written a story that draws you in and gets you invested in the characters.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|PRO's<br /><br />+ The price!<br /><br />+ Super easy to set up on one's home network<br /><br />+ Easy to get install and use apps for mobile devices or Windows laptop<br /><br />CONS's<br /><br />- My 12Mb/sec DSL connection suffered from lag with this when watching via Chrome Browser on Windows laptop<br /><br />- Chrome Browser extension ONLY for Windows and OSX, not for Android tablet or phone. Seriously?!? I thought Google was cutting edge?<br /><br />- Limited services with mobile apps: Yahoo, Hulu, Netflix, Pandora and Google Play<br /><br />- Minimum requirements not listed ON THE BOX when purchasing<br /><br />- Internet browsing only works with Chrome Browser (of course), but getting Chrome Browser to work on some video sites (i.e. Syfy) took some Google searches to figure it out<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I can watch TV shows from CBS, ABC, SyFy on the internet via laptop -- with lag -- on this device.<br />No lag with Roku box...going back to that device.<br />I cannot do any browser based viewing from any mobile device.<br /><br />**UPDATE 11/7/13**<br />I just realized all three of my Blu-Ray players also do Yahoo, Netflix, Pandora, Vudu and many, many other streaming services (paid & free). So no need for this device until more services are offered and mobile internet browsers are supported. The only thing I see this being useful for in its current state is when you are traveling and want more control on what your hotel room offers to watch.<br />Because of the devices potential, I left it at a 3star vs. a 2star.<br /><br />**UPDATE 2015**<br />I eventually found a Groupon where I got this for $16. Kids use it all the time with their devices to watch Youtube.<br />Broadcasting from a tablet seems easier but I still have yet to try things like the Syfy channel website and see if I can watch episodes there.<br />Either way, for the better price, it is faster and easier than my blu-ray players so I gave it an extra star.

B00D2K40WY|3.0|This is a cool app but you have to buy most of it. Its pretty rude to do that to kids. Especially when they are all happy and the game doesn't have their favorite eye shadow color.

B00FRCNNVY|5.0|A good mix of traditional Indian and pop music. The vocal songs are wonderful with Norah Jones, but the instrumentals which make the majority of the CD are good for relaxing or study.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|LOVE IT!! Definitely pleased with this purchase. Easy to use, safe, and takes panoramic pictures. Doesn't get much better than that.
B000WTXEAM|5.0|This album is reflective of the inner spiritual journey George Harrison had embarked upon as he pursued his Eastern spiritual philosophy studies.  The songs reflect his exit and wisdom, and his frustration with various aspects of his life experiences.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Been using these headphones for many many years - on the train, at the gym, at work, etc.  Love em, and there's not many that compare.  Tried Maxell 202's and the sound quality was lacking.  I don't mind the Koss KPH13's, but they seem to be discontinued as well.<br /><br />I wrote to Sony about the MDR-W08L's recently - and their response was that the model(that have been out since 2005) is now discontinued.  And they have other headphones that are comparable.  NO THEY DON'T!!  I just refuse to pay over $20 for headphones.  That's just me though.<br /><br />From reading reviews on here and all other, safe to say I'm not the only one who feels this way.  Sony, bring back MDR-W08L's.  And to third party sellers, lower your damn price on these!
B00005RDRO|5.0|Great classically funny movie. If you see it on TV, they block many of the lines because people are so much more concerned about offending people now. It is a great movie. Watch the original rather than the television unnecessarily censored movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game and you can make like anything! I also like that you can swich people:) I like to swich to God and put shades on him and it is halarious!

B00E6F155E|3.0|It's hard not to love Peter Gabriel's live performances but this camera crew does their best to make you try. I'm just glad the tour was caught on film at all, even if done rather poorly and without vision as this video displays.  I am a huge Peter Gabriel fan and own all of his other concert DVD's but this one is probably a one-time view.<br /><br />Gabriel is a genius at telling and acting out the stories of his songs.  Sadly, the ad-hoc camera crew seemed unable to consider that Gabriel designed the stage show to be seen from a distance and they kept him close in frame most of the time, negating the effect he was going for in the first place.<br /><br />The other thing which is troublesome is a SPOILER ALERT so scroll down a bit if you're interested, otherwise buy the video and be happy.<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />..<br />So, it's like this...  I have a pretty good eye for certain details of live performance which is a blessing and a curse.  Several songs into the show I realized that with VERY little exception, the vocals (and perhaps much more) were overdubbed later. It was done very well with Peter clearly watching his own mouth to match the cadence but between microphone positioning and the obvious problem of dancing and moving around so much, all except maybe one or two songs are overdubbed in a studio later.  This is, in my opinion an unpardonable sin.  Big stage shows often do it from Michael Jackson to Madonna, what you see on video is not what happened live and MJ even lip-synced much of his show due to the complexity and energy required for his dance numbers. And, so it is possible the same has happened here.

B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|This is yet another amazing album from Avril Lavigne!  I have been a huge fan of hers from day one and in my opinion she hasn't released a bad song yet.<br /><br />This album has a little bit of everything as far as musical genres go.  There are classic pop/rock anthems  like Rock N Roll and Here's To Never Growing Up.  There is the rock/piano ballad duet with her husband Chad from Nickelback called Let Me Go.  Then Avril has experimented a little bit with her sound on the songs Give You What You Like, Bad Girl featuring Marilyn Manson and Hello Kitty.  I predict the song Bitchin' Summer will be a graduation anthem come next year for many people.  The song 17 sounds like material from her debut album.  Other stand-out tracks include You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet and Sippin' on Sunshine.  The album closes out with some acoustic mellow songs which are also excellent.  I rate every song on the album 5/5 with the exception of Hello Kitty which gets a 3.5/5.<br /><br />All told this is another 5 star album from Avril Lavigne.  If you are an Avril fan, click the Buy button now and I promise you won't be disappointed.  If you've only liked a few of her songs in the past, you owe it to yourself to listen to the samples of each track and make your decision from there.

B004JN1CW4|5.0|I have read the three books in the Maze Runner series and I've loved them all.  The Death Cure kept me as hooked as the previous two books with the action and suspense.  You finally learn some answers such as what the &#34;flare&#34; is and why WICKED got started.  The author also develops the characters a bit more in this book and there is a strong theme on friendship and trust.  Although a lot of questions were answered, a lot were still left unanswered and up to your imagination.  I highly recommend the series for any teenager who likes to suspense thrillers.  I can't wait for the Maze Runner movie to come out in February.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Buy the book. you'll enjoy it. very thought provoking and good fuel for conversation.<br /><br />two warnings:<br />The beginning of the book is confusing as the scenes go back and forth. There is enough text on ancient wars to get a bit wordy.<br /><br />There are some sad parts of the book that as a parent I found too emotionally taxing and had to skip over them.
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|I love this CD just like the first one. I can listen to it all day long without skipping a song. I believe he has another Grammy right here because no other artist has put out a better album this year in his category. Thank you Robert for keeping everything refreshing. I would have loved to hear Wayne Brady sing but maybe next time. Maybe next time the album can feature those artist who are talented actors comedians and such but not known to sing or rap but really can hold their own. Great job Robert!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This series is far more than Zombies attacking and getting whacked.  It's a great show with superb acting and plot lines.  It's an examination of what happens to people who are trying to survive.  The true villains aren't the Zombies -- it's other humans.  After all, what emotional depth can a Zombie show?  I can't wait for the next season.

1449305172|5.0|I found out about the Lean Startup principles when I was doing a product management internship at a German startup at the end of 2011 until May 2012. To validate a new product idea, the founders (my employers) gave me the books \\"Lean Startup\\" by Eric Ries and \\"4 Steps to the Epiphany\\" by Steve Blank. After reading Steve Blank's book about Customer Development (which is a tough read, but with good, practicable insights), I found Eric Ries' book not that of an eye-opener anymore. Fortunately, I came across Ash Maurya's blog with good posts and step-for-step guides on how to implement Lean Startup in SaaS products.<br /><br />A few months later the book \\"Running Lean\\" was released and it is still one of the most important reads for product managers in my opinion! I love how simple Ash states important and complex concepts and how he delivers practicable to deal with uncertainty.<br /><br />In April 2012 I started organizing the Lean Startup Meetups in Karlsruhe, Germany, and try to push the topic further in this area. Although I have read all books of the \\"Lean Series\\", \\"Running Lean\\" is still the one important book I recommend to new members of this group. Thank you, Ash!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|While so many authors can spin an amazing and suspense filled story, only Coben can completely surprise me. His books are nearly impossible to put down. The last thought i have at the finish of every story is &#34;wow!&#34; Truly a talented writer.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I don't know why I had avoided watching this; for some reason I had really low expectations. But my wife purchased this and after sitting through it with her I was pleasantly surprised and entertained.<br /><br />You could call the story somewhat predictable, but the quality of the voice acting and the jokes pull you through a decent family night of entertainment. This is a movie that is safe for kids while still having jokes that an adult will enjoy. There are so many little moments that make this memorable that I don't want to spoil any of it here.<br /><br />Like I said, the plotline itself you can probably see coming a mile away, but the journey is still fun and we find ourselves using some of the quotes in real life now as in-jokes. If I were to compare it to another animated film, I'd say it's not quite Shrek quality, but really close (and better than some of the Shrek sequels)
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This is a cool app. We camp a bit and love to know the phases of the moon on particular days so we know if we will be able to see stars, etc... Great graphics!

B0049U4NQO|5.0|Great Ending and suspense the whole story. There are a lot of twists and turns. It's a really good book.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A very moving story about the daily life of a young German girl living in Germany during WWII.  The voice of Death leads you through the story and<br />gives an added perspective.  The focus is not about the war itself but about the people living in Germany during this time and how their lives were impacted by the war.  I'd highly recommend reading this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't get enough of this trilogy.. I finished reading the three books in just three days! This is highly recommended
0375842209|4.0|This is a bittersweet story told through the eyes of a young observer of Nazi Germany. The characters were well defined and interesting. Although I enjoyed the story, I found the writing style disjointed and at times difficult to follow.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good fun game! It gradually gets more difficult with each level of achievement so it keeps your interest and has a lot of different puzzles to try so you don't get bored. I haven't paid for any extras and really enjoy playing.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I can watch this serious over and over and over. I like that the episodes play without you having to select the next episode. I have other dvd series and some of them require you to keep selecting play for the following episodes. Even if you fall asleep you can always skip to the scene that you last saw.<br />Also loved the case that it came in; makes storage easy. And if you need to pack up and go, you just need to grap and go and no disc or episode will be left behind. Even though there is the carrying case the you can travel with one season. Also found that very useful. If you love the Gilmores you'll love this little package.
B004ZJZQFG|4.0|This is a good movie that I stumbled upon one Sunday morning, and liked it so much I ordered the bluray. It reminds me a lot of The Hunt for Red October, and it is based on true events. If you like WW2 era movies, and Matthew McCannaghey, you will love it!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|All that led up to this?!?! I was disappointed. I struggled to get through this book. Most times it was boring. And I'm not upset because of the big surprise that happened in the end. I was actually pleased with that. It was just the the overall book that I disliked. Read it if you must.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Another movie that I found on Netflix, and could never seem to catch the whole thing-but really like this movie! Good action, well produced. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine (the new James T. Kirk from the Star Trek reboot series), Rosario Dawson-good cast.

B00ECLU346|1.0|Lowsy. Not worth watching. I felt that they could have written a better movie.  This felt forced and hurried.  Dont watch it.

1907523588|5.0|Virgina Woolf writes in a style that makes one pay close attention to every subtlety, nuance, and detail.  The reader only learns about the characters through the other characters - making it a difficult read.  There is no &#34;narrator.&#34;<br />Virginia Woolf always comes back to Mrs. Ramsay, even after she is dead.  So, if there is a 'main' character, it is Mrs. Ramsay.<br />Virginia Woolf, being a huge feminist herself, tends to talk about women and the restrictions placed on them and how they had to conform to society's rules or else be ousted by society.<br />Virgina Woolf was the great innovator of her times when it came to women and feminism.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|As I read this excellent easy-to-read book, I kept thinking how I could adapt it for my 15 year old grandchildren. I will definitely find a way for them and their mothers to conduct a book review with me sometime this winter! The sooner, the better. THAT is how valuable this book is for the upcoming generations and for both genders!
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Despite getting off to a good start, this book was ultimately too disjointed -- with too many characters, too many digressions, too many shifts in time -- to be anything other than a chore to read.  Numerous plot lines are simply dropped.  A lot of them seemed irrelevant anyway.  It just becomes boring to labor through the details of lives that aren't connected to any real story.  It's like Peyton Place, only without any sense of humor about its inanity.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Is there a better way to buy on your mobile device ? Nope. Look nowhere else because you will be disappointed.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My six year old Grandson loves this game, and it keeps him entertained for quite some time.<br />Would highly recommend~
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I didn't see the Swedish version so I won't address that one. Since the author overwhelming approved of this one, why bother ? This is what horror is, something that delves into real fears and the trials of life. Let me in will hit a cord with any kid who had to deal with a bully or being a self sufficient child of a divorced family. The unprejudiced love that kids like this can have for those that a different and the sacrifices they are willing to make. Choke Moretz is amazing as always and Elias Koteas is his usual creepy self... Not many can pull it off. There is no twist, or tacked on ending but rather what happens seems most logical in the films illogical world.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Though it lacks the profundity and depth traditionally associated with the brand, “Star Trek: Into Darkness,” the twelfth installment in the movie series, has enough rip-roaring adventure and jaw-dropping visual effects to make it a satisfying experience for the action-oriented moviegoer.<br /><br />In this sequel to the prequel that successfully re-booted the series in 2009 (both directed by J.J. Abrams), some initially unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) has begun targeting the  leaders of Starfleet, and it is up to the Enterprise and her crew to root him out of his hiding place deep inside enemy Klingon territory.<br /><br />Thanks to the screenplay by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, there’s the same spirited verbal jousting between Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) over the issue of feelings-vs.-rationality that’s been going on for decades now, along with a bit of a discussion about the needs of the individual vs. the greater good, as well as about whether the Enterprise should become involved with military conflict instead of just space exploration. But, for the most part, this is a straight-ahead action movie and, as such, it unquestionably delivers the goods. Indeed, there are some truly astonishing action scenes leading up to one through the skies of a 23rd Century San Francisco that has to be seen to be believed - even if believability is never really the prime factor in films of this type.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Then you must see this. Is it a bit on rue corny side ? Of course but that is the point. It is pure unadulterated fun that reminds you of being a adolescent and what that imagination brought to boys and girls. Del Toro makes movies for big kids and viewing this under a microscope is like viewing you adolescent daydreams of monsters and robots under one as well...and we all know that is silly and pointless. Sit back and enjoy the biggest thrill ride in years

B0068RHGJM|5.0|When I heard this album for the first time, it was a bit of a let down. More mellow, a bit too long at times and not so accessible. In fact, my favourite song in the beginning was - I want my tears back. But alas, as great as it was, the main riff reminded too much of Iron Maiden's Dance of Death.<br /><br />Then something magical happened... I began to thoroughly and fully enjoy the magic and theatrical vistas of Last ride of the day, Rest calm, Arabesque, The Crow, Storytime, Song of myself and others. The chorus of the Last ride of the day is so powerful, sometimes my eyes are full of tears... I feel like a child, flying on a roller-coaster in a fantasy world, enjoying every second of the ride.<br /><br />Then the WHOLE album settled as a one piece! Nightwish never produced anything like this. Theatrical brilliance.<br /><br />I discover something new every time. Slow, love, slow, was a very strange tune for NW, but sounded promising. Mellow and jazzy. A lounge in a fantasy world - or - in an Enterprise or Voyager. My imagination runs wild there... It's raining outside... or we are cruising somewhere deep in the space. Anette is singing beautifully here in a cozy and warm atmosphere. We are drinking hot teas with apple and cinnamon. And oh *that* lonely trumpet at the end of the song! Masterpiece. It's now one of my favourite songs of NW.<br /><br />Good music produce emotions you can visualize and feel. The only other Nightwish album that gave me the same burst of emotions from start to finish was Once. And after Tarja left, I thought - well, it's over. Once was a masterpiece, the pinnacle of their career and no way anything else could even touch it.<br />Luckily and totally unexpected - I was proved SO wrong. This album is on the same height as Once, yet totally different level. They managed not to repeat themselves after everything they have been through! Wow!<br /><br />When Imaginaerum song begins, I already miss the entire album. I'm reminded of the beautiful journey I just had. Time to start Taikatalvi again!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|this much anticipated third and final book did not disappoint. even though i found the first half of the book dry, in retrospect it was necessary to understand the big picture. the harsh reviews for this book are understandable because as fans, we become so invested in the story and especially the characters, that it invokes deep emotions when tragedy befalls them. although i wish it could've ended differently, i commend the author for sticking to her guns and having courage to write the story the way she did. i also loved the way the death and acceptance was handled, so sad, honest and remaind true to the character and story. this ending was truly bittersweet and due to that, i will remember it for a long time to come.

B008JFUNJQ|4.0|“Ender's Game”, a 1985 novel from Orson Scott Card, is the subject of a new film and director Gavin Hood (X:Men Origins: Wolverine). It is a science-fiction action film with an uncharacteristic premise. It is uncharacteristic in the sense that as a science-fiction action film, it is less eventful and more thoughtful. Andrew “Ender” Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is an extremely gifted kid with the mentality for success in battle. He is closely watched by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and quickly moved up the ranks of a futuristic military academy.<br /><br />An alien species called the 'formics' or in the book, 'the buggers', are threatening earth's existence and desperate moves are needed to be made. “Ender's Game” does have elements that are similar to two films in my opinion, but seeing as though the book came out in 1985, those films appear to be inspired by the book. Those movies are “Full Metal Jacket” (1987) and “Starship Troopers” (1997). The film focuses on the training of military recruits preparing for war against bugs and it makes a broad statement about war and its effect on the human condition.<br /><br />This is easily the best thing that Harrison Ford has done in years and his performance is only bolstered by the performance of sort of unknown Asa Butterfield. Butterfield encompasses everything needed to portray a complex and challenging role. Maybe his previous performance in a rare gem like “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas” prepared him for such an emotional and deep character. Much is placed upon the shoulders of the teenager Ender Wiggin and Butterfield was flawless at bringing you into an inner-turmoil that many times can only be described in a book.<br /><br />I wondered why “Ender's Game” was not a summer blockbuster release because the effects are well done and the movie looked like a blockbuster type thing, but now that I've viewed it, I understand its release completely. This isn't a blockbuster release type film. This is a thoughtful film, more suitable for Oscar season and a more thoughtful movie-goer. The movie challenges you to question things and rethink things, just as its lead character does, separating him from others.<br /><br />The ending of the film seem to be rushed and thrown together; most undoubtedly to prepare this film for a possible franchise of films, but that would be the only thing that I disliked about it. Not that the ending was bad, but in a film that was already near 2-hours, what happened in its final minutes, to be done properly would have required at least another 20 or 30 minutes that the creator decided to forgo. Otherwise, “Ender's Game” is loaded with solid performances and intelligence.is a thoughtful film, more suitable for Oscar season and a more thoughtful movie-goer.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|OMG THIS THING! I was so excited to get it and actually was able to just put my xbox up for sale because I've reached the age where I was only using it to watch Netflix.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|Many people had suggested this book to me and I am pleased to say that after much apprehension I enjoyed it. The main setting was very interesting and I wish the featured character had spent a longer amount of time in the Glade. Still I am eager to read the next book.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like this DVD a lot! After the first day, I was so sore, but I pushed through and feel great. I'm a mom with 2 kids, my oldest is 2 and the baby is 7 months. No way do I have time to hit the gym every day, but this is short enough that I can fit it in while the baby sleeps and my oldest watches an episode of Little Einsteins. After 4 days on level 1, I wasn't quite feeling as satisfied after the work out, so I upped to level 2. Loved it. I don't feel like I've lost weight or inches, but I FEEL better, and that's the important thing to me.  Update: I put this tape away for a while. Ok, really, for about a year and a half. When I wrote this review originally, my son was 7 months old. Well, he just turned 2, and I decided it was time to start working out again. I eat fairly well, and with my diet alone, I tend to hover around the same weight. I don't gain, but I definitely don't lose either. I started this work out again one week ago, determined to make it through the whole 30 days. I didn't modify my intake, just started adding the work out. In 1 week, I will admit that I haven't lost any weight. In fact, I gained a pound. But! I'm so excited to announce that I've lost 1 inch off of my hips and thighs. I'm still on level 1. My goal is to do level 1 for 10 days, then level 2 for 10, level 3 for 10. Im really happy to be losing some stubborn inches of post-baby weight, and I can't wait to see the results after 23 more days!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I wish that this app would have more stylus writing options like using stylus written notes on the lined paper rather than only being able to use it on the drawing pad. nevertheless I think this is a very good app for those who like to express themselves through writing.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|To anyone giving negative reviews of this girl, you are clearly mistaken. Everyone keeps talking about how she has such a long way to go before being anything good because her music is \\"simple.\\" In a world where Dubstep seems to be the hottest music now, I understand why you would say that. However, what you fail to realize is that Lorde is more about the notes that you do not play, instead of the notes you do, which she does in outstanding fashion. Calling her music \\"simple\\" shows that you know nothing about the composition of sounds. Please take another listen, and pay attention to every noise you hear, not just the loudest ones. A simple snap of the snare drum at a certain point in the song can make all the difference. It's funny how the negative reviews all sound like people are upset about the fact that she's doing this all at such a young age. Give her a break. I sat down and listened to some interviews after hearing this album because I was thoroughly intrigued, and with good reason. She is a very smart and observant person, and it shines through every time she speaks. Do yourselves a favor, and listen to this album through a few times, as it will continue to grow more and more on you. Again, her musical composition is stunning. Cannot wait to see her grow as an artist; she's going to move continents.

0316219266|5.0|A straight forward and easy read!  Explosive in content and focus.  Though more critical of Amazon then not,  I applaud Amazon.Com for allowing reviews as well as their classic book display to be pinned on the book.  Read the book just to get a different glimpse of Amazon.  Let's face it, Amazon initiated a whole new culture of digital sales.  They have re-invented the retail world, albeit with brute determination and drive.

1476729085|3.0|Don Tillman at age 39 is a brilliant professor of genetics at an Australian university. He' so very smart, but so socially awkward that he never gets beyond a first date.  He hates intimate gestures and he seems to exhibit the tendencies of people with Aspergers syndrome. Oddly enough, as the story opens Don has agreed to do a lecture for his friend Gene on the subject of Aspergers.<br /><br />When his friend suggests it is time Don found himself a wife, Don reacts by designing:  \\"The Wife Project,\\" which consists of a creative questionnaire of all the things that Don sees as important in a mate. His perfect partner must be punctual, tidy, logical, and NOT a smoker!<br /><br />Meet Rosie --- she does not possess the \\"perfect partner qualities\\" on Don's list.  Rosie's a bartender, she smokes and even arrives late for her appointment with Don. Rosie, however, has an agenda of her own.  She's looking for her biological father, and thinks a genetics expert like Don might be just the one to help her, especially since he has access to his university's lab and could run some DNA tests there if necessary. Rosie's mother died when she was 10, and had told her that her father was one of her medical school classmates.  It isn't long before the \\"Wife Project\\" is put on hold, so that Don can help Rosie find out about her father. As their unlikely relationship blooms, Don realizes that love can't always be best predicted by a questionnaire.<br /><br />The story is told from Don's point of view, and was quite funny at times, but listening to this one on audio had a way getting on my nerves after a while.  It wasn't really the narrator's fault either.The narrator Dan O'Grady did a decent job, it was just that the story was too quirky and cutesy for my taste . Don't go by me though as I think readers who enjoy romantic comedies and quirky characters will probably enjoy this debut novel.<br /><br />3.5/5 stars

The mystery had many twists and turns that kept the reader guessing, although not surprised when the truths were revealed.  I want to read another of Carlos Zafon's novels.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this one is a lot like Sprinkle Island - if you like that one you will like this one. It is gothic in nature so if you don't like to see cartoon bats explode or melt don't get but if you like Elvira type humor and physics based puzzles this is right up your alley. Like sprinkle Island it has a story, the aiming is tricky and can get frustrating but I still love this game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It is so cute and entertaining. My son started it but I have taken over...it just so fun to play...
0399255370|4.0|This was wonderfully original and it made me laugh out loud. My only criticism was the crayons were a bit too wordy. I would have preferred some of their letters to be different lengths. Loved the peach crayon who got his paper ripped off!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very well written book.  The reader gets attached to the characters early in the story line.  It's incredible that children had to face such a scary and daunting future yet for most, it turned out well.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have this on both my iPhone and my Kindle Fire and use it daily. When I travel, it's my alarm clock, at work it drowns out all the office sounds.  Worth the price!
031623480X|5.0|I am unable to take statin drugs so this is perfect for my program.. I am very impressed with the vast information Dr. Perlmutter has been able to organize into one book....
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Fantastic Movie, to start.  Even Better in Blue Ray  I saw it is 3D, at the Movies but can't afford a 3D TV&#62;
0345494768|5.0|This book has so many great drawings and behind the scenes photos you won't believe it! It will keep you turning pages and then going back and reading it again--and again!  A must have for all Star Wars fans!
0439023513|2.0|I shocked myself by reading the first Hunger Games book and actually enjoying it. I read the second book and then I had to read this one.  I was pretty disappointed with how rushed the endings of book two and three are.  Everything ended up getting jumbled and confusing.  It felt like Collins was rushing to wrap up the ending, but I'm not sure why.
0765325950|5.0|Finally, the end.  I still have some unanswered questions. I miss Robert Jordan's obsession with describing dresses just a wee bit. Sanderson did a great job of winding up a lot of threads into a cohesive end for a wonderful book series. Kudos to them both!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|The king, the god, the boogie monster of rap, whatever you wanna call him... Em kills it on MMLP2. Couple songs I'm not sure about yet, but just finished listening from start to finish and overall great album.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|great free kindle version of a classic! I'm grateful to be able to store this on an electronic device and ditch my paper copy.
B002VX0A40|5.0|my son loved this toy. He especially loved the rattle ball the dragon is holding. Unfortunately he ripped the ball from the dragon's hand. We kept the rattle ball around for several more months because he still played with it. Now my daughter plays with this toy.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Simple & Cool puzzle game. Easily play for kids as they can find hints to help them solve the puzzle. My kids enjoyed it for hours.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game. I have played several of their games. Wish some of the quest didn't take as long as they do.  But all and all fun game.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|protects and charges the headset when travelling.  I use this whenever I am travelling to charge it in the evening or when onsite with customers so when I need it again, it is fully charged and ready.
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|This album is fabulous, as other reviewers have noted.  I will not repeat that praise here.<br /><br />However, for those who are purchasing the MP3 version of this album, two words of warning:<br /><br />(1) The MP3 file for &#34;Potential&#34; (disc 1 track 18) is a bad rip.  I have reported the problem, and was told that an &#34;MP3 expert&#34; will investigate, so hopefully this will be resolved soon.<br /><br />(2) This album is 4 ~20-min songs, which Arjen broke into 42 tracks.  While the geek in me appreciates the Hitchhiker's reference, this makes the album all but un-listenable as MP3's.  The brief breaks between tracks is distracting, and given that the tracks are so short and numerous, it totally takes me out of the experience.  Luckily I discovered an &#34;alternate&#34; digital format for the album as one file for each CD, and I broke those up into 4 tracks for myself.
B00EDOS6IC|4.0|I have very little experience with this band, however having seen Myles sing with Slash got me interested.  Then the band did a great thing by playing the entire album on Youtube & whatever other media I happened to notice which gave me a better chance to hear them in their entirety.  After only 2 listens I ordered this album & have not looked back.<br />It's clearly more heavy than what little I had heard several years ago but that is not the only reason I love this album, the songwriting itself is just classy.  Some really catchy chorus', some very meaty riffs & there is an ebb & flow to this album that just works.  From my personal perspective I like the back half of this album much better starting with Waters Rising thru the closer, Fortress.  With that said, initially, I enjoyed the first half substantially better, so it is clear to me that when I find myself digging in different directions I have a new &#34;monster album&#34; on my hands, & that is exactly what this is.  Undeniably well done & certainly to be properly noted in my albums of the year listing.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|If you like the main characters in the TV series you will love the character's even more. The development that Martin puts into them here is so worth the read. Tyrion is fighting with wits and steel, Arya shows us more of the torment that she is going through as well as her skills and Jon's story is so much more compelling! Great read couldn't put it down at the end! Winter is coming, long live house Stark!
0385351399|5.0|Wow, what a book. I don't think I've been this affected by a novel since I read American Gods and possibly even going back to Stranger in a Strange Land. I never knew horror could be so banal. Way to go, Mr. Eggers!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best game ever if they can make deer hunter 2015 with just  a little bit more animation that would make the game the best in the world
B001AGXEAG|2.0|Apparently this is not my favorite movie after all. After never having seen it, I decided that it needed to be seen. Now I've seen it. And I'd prefer to never see it again.
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|I loved the concept of the book and the start.. The university examples were great... But I think the whole point of power and limits got over stretched. I would have loved to see more discussions and examples on how to turn an apparent weakness into a strength .. How to change the rules of the game.. More day to day, business, public figures examples would have made this more enriching
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!! Such a twist to all the women's lives and how they are all connected... Really makes you think about your life and all the different possibilities of how things could and can happen.. Highly recommended!
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Pretty entertaining, but is geared towards the younger age. Offers fun puzzles that aren't too difficult for kids to solve.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great series of books, keeps you reading them once you start.  I have now read these 4 times and probably will read them all another few times.  Good easy read.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|Fun game to kill time with. Offers a nice range of difficulties per level and I like how there are different modes you can use for each level.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|this is part of a great series, that give you lots to discuss with others about what these books are meant to represent.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had alot of problems with storage space up until I downloaded this app and now I never have to worry about it!
B00G32TD98|4.0|Better than expected. I would even watch it again. The hands were the best part! Would like to see more of these antics in horror movies
B008XG1X18|5.0|At first I didn't think it was going to work but I started messing around with it and it worked. I live pinterest and im so happy I can do it all on my kindle fire!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|lLoved the first two but this one was disappointing.  I might have gotten past some of it but you had to kill off a main character!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. it is a nice strategy game but it would be nicer if it had more levels. But still cool game
B00338QENI|5.0|Loved this book!  Wonderfully written and kept me interested, couldn't pull my nose out of it!  Love that it combined the science of the issue and the lives of the people connected.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Easy to see, use and open. My students can use it<br />with ease and the price is great. I would recommend the use of this calculator for chemistry and physics.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|The game works good. If you like the PC game of Polar Bowler you will like this game. The game is different then the PC game. It take time to get used to controlling the bowling ball.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Super fun + challenging. Fun stuff and weird yet funny emojis to guess. I definitely suggest downloading this app. For sure
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This app did not work properly. Therefore, I deleted this app. The app does not work like the regular Facebook app.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Loved the Design and the light illumination which glows &#34;Diablo&#34; in DEMON RED which is the main attraction! Good for CS and CS go and Dota who click a lot and this mouse promised 10 million clicks which is quite a lot for lifetime :D Not equal to original Sensei Edition but decent enough for the price compared to Original Sensei and Sensei Fnatic edition. And most importantly &#34;THIS IS NOT A XAI, IT'S A SENSEI&#34;!!!!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Great group!<br /><br />Love the music of this group. Got the CD as promised, no problems at all. Love it again!
B000AMJC2K|2.0|I was eyeballing this for ages and finally had some cash to blow on a perk.<br /><br />Long story short, I am very disappointed. All the joints are incredibly stiff and if you loosen them just slightly they'll flop around helplessly. Positioning your monitor is a real pain, and you can't just change positions on a whim. You really have to work with it and get it into a position you want, then hope that the joints haven't loosened up too much.<br /><br />The wire holders snapped clean off while I was installing it. Never even had a chance to use them. Within a day the plastic covers that you press in to raise and lower the bar fell off and it looked like they had just been secured by a dab of rubber cement.<br /><br />It works to give me space underneath my monitor, but I really wish I had spent my money elsewhere.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Really liked the end. While I have not been a fan of Anne Rice's books, this proved to be entertaining. At first, I did not know that Lestat was played by Tom Cruise. His performance pleased me.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Wow, what an engrossing story. Action throughout the book. I was amazed with all the twists and turns. When you think you have it figured out, another twist comes through. This has plenty of mystery and action to keep the reader interested till the very end. I'm looking forward tho reading more of his books!
B005K17RU0|2.0|My home location is not located correctly on the map.  I have tried several times to contact anyone that could address and MOVE it to the correct position.  SAVANNAH Georgia is not North of Atlanta!!  Cannnot determine how to delete it either!
B009LQKHIO|1.0|Predictable story line. Too much time spent on sex scenes. Characters need more depth. Would not recommend these books to anyone.
1451666179|5.0|A great combination of funny and introspection.  I would have liked there to be more funny towards the end, as it became a little harder to get through, but I'm very glad I read it all.<br /><br />Hyperbole and a Half is probably the only thing that has ever made me laugh my ass off one moment, and then send me into a plane of deep metacognition the next.<br /><br />Also, as many others have stated, the chapters on depression are excellent, something that I believe everyone should read.  They provide an uncommon insight into what depression is, and how it affects those that we know and love.<br /><br />If you are unsure about buying this book, I suggest you read a few of the comics she has on her blog.  My favorites are: Depression 1&2, anything involving the dogs, The God of Cake, This is Why I'll Never Be an Adult, and also the newest one about the dinosaur costume.  If you thoroughly enjoy her stuff (I as did), please consider buying this book, or making a purchase from her store.  If not, then maybe this isn't the right type of humor for you.<br /><br />This book is a lot thicker than I imagined it would be, like at least and inch thick, and is also very colourful and excellent quality.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I love all songs, the choral work, the guitars, ALL THE THINGS!!<br /><br />It remind me the old school Stryper, and that´s all you need to know, this is a great great work, that brings blessings and good rock to us!<br /><br />All I can say is: get a copy, you won't regret it!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game so much play everyday just wish it was easier to win the under two fifty. Other than that would totally recommend
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like it but the only reason I'm doing this is so I can get points but its a real fun game
B0028IDXDS|5.0|The baby is only a month old but this may become the official lovie.  I adore that it's a stuffed animal and a paci all in one.  You can hardly get more &#34;comfy&#34; than that (great transitional item).  I'm going to have to buy more of them!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Big fan of Tim Allen and this is one of my favorites. I laugh harder every time I watch it. If you are watching on DVD, be sure to change the audio to Thermian. Too Funny!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|After reading Pillars and World Without End, I was pleased with the book. Enjoyed the historic aspect as well. Looking forward to the next.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Just like the previous two books in Cassandra Clare's \\"The Mortal Instruments\\" series, I found this book, \\"City of Glass\\" to be even more surprising and thrilling to read. Clare' s unique method of painting the characters in the story, from the bedazzled warlock Magnus Bane to the slimy, slithering demons, is as magnificently poetic as a skilled artist placing precise strokes on a blank canvas. While reading the story, I experienced some of the same feelings the characters felt, sadness, excitement, betrayal, anger and live. Cassandra Clare has written another superb story. I can't wait to read the next one.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Aslan, throughout his book rejects the whole idea of the resurrection of Jesus. He says on page 176 the following statement:<br /><br />* P. 176....Paul makes a key point. Without the resurrection, the whole edifice of Jesus's claim to the mantle of the messiah comes crashing down.<br />* ....the fact remains that the resurrection is not a historical event. P 176<br />* ....Again, these stories are not meant to be accounts of historical events; they are carefully crafted rebuttals to an argument that is taking place off-screen. p177<br />* Luke portrays the risen Jesus as addressing this issue himself by patiently explaining to his disciples, who \\"had hoped he was the one to redeem Israel\\" (Luke 24: 21), how his death and resurrection were in reality the fulfillment of the messianic prophecies, how everything written about the messiah \\"in the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms\\" led to the cross and the empty tomb. \\"Thus it is written that the messiah would suffer and rise again on the third day,\\" Jesus instructs his disciples (Luke 24: 44- 46). Except that nowhere is any such thing written: not in the Law of Moses, not in the prophets, not in the Psalms. In the entire history of Jewish thought there is not a single line of scripture that says the messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again on the third day, which may explain why Jesus does not bother to cite any scripture to back up his incredible claim. P177<br /><br />Aslan tells us that nowhere in the Law of Moses, prophets, Psalms, the entire history of Jewish thought, is there one line of scripture that says the Messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again on the third day. And that Jesus doesn't bother to cite any scripture to back up his incredible claim.<br /><br />Let's see if Aslan knows what he is talking about!<br /><br />Let's begin with the first five books of the Law and the question of Resurrection. Does it say anything about Resurrection? That Physical death is not the end for those who believe?<br /><br />* Exodus 3:6  6 Moreover He said, I am the God of thy father, The God of Abraham, The God of Isaac, and The God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.<br /><br />The verb is a verb of being, present tense.  Aslan claims `fluency in biblical Greek.'  Where is his exegesis of this verse and refutation of Jesus' conclusion?  It is recorded that Jesus quoted this scripture regarding the idea of Resurrection:<br /><br />* Matthew 22:31  31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, Matthew 22:32  32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<br />* Mark 12:26-27  26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  27 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.<br />* Luke 20:37-38  37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.  38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.<br /><br />During the ministry of Jesus, He spoke of his coming death, and that in three days He would rise again.  He quoted from the law to point out resurrection reality. Jesus said this scripture proves that life after physical death exists; the bodies of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were in graves, but these men were in God's presence and still alive. God didn't say, `I was The God of... but rather, I am being The God of...'. They were alive!<br /><br />So, is Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob alive after death?<br /><br />Abraham, was asked by God to offer His son, Isaac as a burnt offering. Yet, God had promised that through this child, Isaac, His promised descendants would come.  God told him that his offspring through this  child would be more numerous than the stars one can count in the sky at night. Were it not for substitution; God providing a sacrifice that day to take the place of Isaac, who had been designated to die, Abraham would have killed and burnt his own son as a sacrifice to obey God's command. And God would have either raised Isaac up from death and disfigurement to fulfill His promise to Abraham, or provided a substitute sacrifice to take Isaac's  place in death that day.<br /><br />So, Is God able to bring back physical life from death and physical disintegration? And I don't mean in the sweet bye and bye; but during Abraham's life? Abraham told his servants that came with them that day,  that He and Isaac would return to them!<br /><br /> Genesis 22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.<br /><br />Did Abraham believe in Resurrection power over death and disfigurement? His above statement to those who traveled with them would make no sense otherwise.  He took the knife, wood, and fire for the sacrifice, and would have killed Isaac; He had to be stopped by The Lord!<br /><br />* KJV Genesis 22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.<br />* KJV Genesis 22:9 ¶ And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.<br />KJV Genesis 22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.KJV Genesis 22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.KJV Genesis 22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thyson, thine only son from me.<br /><br />The New Testament witness is this: Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, (Heb. 11:19). Not one of these days, but in a moment of time.<br />So, is belief in resurrection from death and disfigurement a part of the faith revealed in the Law?<br /><br />The idea that God can take something that is dead and bring it back to life from such an impossible condition is taught also by the law in the budding of Aaron's rod in Numbers 17.  Aaron's rod was an almond branch; a dried, dead, branch, that had been separated for years from any source of nourishment. It is a fact that Almond trees begin bearing a crop in the third year after planting; trees reach full bearing 5 to six years after planting.  The fruit matures 7-8 months after flowering. And yet, what does the law of Moses say about Aarons rod?  It budded, brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds; all in one night laying before the presence of God which was above the ark of the covenant!<br /><br />Numbers 17:8 ¶ And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.<br /><br />So, can God take something created; something dead and lifeless, and bring it back to life? Cause it to live again in a moment of time? Does the law teach resurrection power from such an impossible condition? Can God bring back from the dead One He has chosen and anointed to bring forth His purpose? Aaron was chosen; The Messiah was said to be a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek, Psalms 110:4<br /><br />In the Song of Moses, Deuteronomy 32:39, notice what God says to us about His abilities regarding resurrection: \\".....I kill, and I make alive; I have wounded and I heal....<br /><br />So, can God kill and make alive? Can God bring back to life someone that is killed?<br /><br />And what of the prophet Hosea, and his declaration about Resurrection power over the dead and decomposed? (Sheol in Hebrew is translated, the majority of times, as simply `the grave'; and is translated by the Greek word, hades)<br /><br />* LXE Hosea 13:14 I will deliver them out of the power of Hades (sheol), and will redeem them from death: where is thy penalty, O death? O Hades, where is thy sting? comfort is hidden from mine eyes.<br />* YLT Hosea 13:14 From the hand of Sheol I do ransom them, From death I redeem them, Where is thy plague, O death? Where thy destruction, O Sheol? Repentance is hid from Mine eyes.<br /><br />Here  above us we have translated, in the Greek Septuagint, LXE, and a literal translation from the Hebrew, YLT, Hosea 13:14.<br /><br />So, can God deliver His people out of the grave? Can God bring them back, (redeem them) from death? Is this the message of the prophets?<br /><br />What of Isaiah the prophet and his remarkable prophetic picture of the substitutionary death of the coming Savior in Isaiah 53?<br /><br />After describing His sufferings and death:<br /><br />Isaiah 53:8  8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.<br />53:12  12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death:<br />Isaiah 53:10  10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin,<br /><br />Then it says this:<br /><br />53:10  10 .....he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.Isaiah 53:11  11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:<br />53:12  12..... Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death:<br />This prophecy can only be understood in terms of the resurrection of the coming redeemer, who, after His death would be alive again.<br /><br />So, Can God bring back from the dead the coming Substitute Who would die for the sins of the world? Can God redeem Him from the grave? From Death?<br /><br />In the Law, in Genesis 3:15, there God told Adam and Eve that although the serpent, would bruise the heel of the coming seed of the woman, the divine seed would ultimately be victorious and would destroy the wicked one. The evidence for such an interpretation of this passage can also be found in the tradition and history of Jewish thought.<br /><br />So, will the coming seed receive a bruise, which is temporary physical trauma, and yet, in this bruising, bring about the undoing of the devil? Is the New Testament idea that this passage finds fulfillment in the doctrine of Jesus' resurrection, a reasonable application?<br /><br />And what of Psalm 16? Notice the negative in the construction at the beginning of the verse, both Greek and Hebrew emphasizing that deliverance from death would prevent corruption and the necessity for a grave.<br /><br />* \\"My flesh also shall rest in hope. For not thou wilt leave my soul in hell (Sheol: Grave); neither wilt thou suffer shine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore\\" (Psalm 16:9-11).<br /><br />So, Did the prophet David, prophesy by God's Spirit that someone from His seed would escape the grave? And not see corruption after being killed? Which is exactly what `Sheol' and `corruption' assumes.<br /><br />This fact was quoted by the Apostolic ministry, in Acts 13:32-37, pointing out that God had made promise to David and his seed  that one from his loins would be raised from death to not see corruption, and fulfill God's promise to David; even the sure mercies!<br /><br />And what of Ezekiel the prophet's revelation of the valley of dry bones? Please read carefully what is said here:<br /><br />* Ezekiel 37:1-14  The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, {2} And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. {3} And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest. {4} Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. {5} Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: {6} And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. ............12 Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. {13} And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, {14} And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.<br /><br />So, can bones live again? Can breath, and flesh, and sinew return to a dead, decomposed person? Can God bring people back from the grave?  Is resurrection reality taught by this Prophet?<br /><br />Aslan said in his book the following concerning this passage: \\"....is very obviously about healing from illness, not literally being raised from death.\\" page 4337,4338.<br /><br />Is this an intelligent logical conclusion from the language of Ezekiel 37? This is scholarship?<br /><br />Zechariah the prophet, speaking of the future proposal of redemption that will be extended one more time to the house of Israel, speaks of them looking upon someone they would pierce! The idea presented here carries with it not just the idea of His death, but of His Resurrection!<br /><br />* Zechariah 12:10: \\"They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourneth for his only son.\\"<br /><br />So, can The coming Messiah be rejected by the Jews,  pierced through, and then be raised again so that they could `look upon' Him? Is Resurrection from Piercing taught here? Is this scripture a reasonable application to Jesus who was delivered to be crucified (pierced) by the Jews?<br /><br />Consider the following scriptures given with  a variety of translations, that clearly teach resurrection from death and decomposition:<br /><br />* TNK Daniel 12:2 Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, others to reproaches, to everlasting abhorrence.LXE Daniel 12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproach and everlasting shame.<br /><br />* NAS Isaiah 26:19 Your dead will live; Their corpses will rise.

Wake up and sing, you dwellers in the dust, for your dew will be a radiant dew, but the earth will give birth to the shades.<br /><br />* Proverbs 15:24  24 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell (sheol: grave) beneath.

CJB Proverbs 15:24 For the prudent, the path of life goes upward; thus he avoids Sh'ol below.TNK Proverbs 15:24 For an intelligent man the path of life leads upward, In order to avoid Sheol below.<br /><br />I mentioned that the idea of resurrection is strongly taught in Jewish thought. Aslan says it isn't.  Consider the following:<br /><br />According to Josephus, the Pharisees taught a resurrection:<br /><br />\\"that every soul is imperishable, but that only those of the righteous pass into another body, while those of the wicked are, on the contrary, punished with eternal torment\\" -Josephus Wars 2.8.14<br /><br />\\"they hold the belief that an immortal strength belongs to souls, and that there are beneath the earth punishments and rewards for those who in life devoted themselves to virtue or vileness, and that eternal imprisonment is appointed for the latter, but the possibility of returning to life for the former\\" -Josephus Ant. 18.1.3<br /><br />The ultimate triumph of the Pharisaic view of the resurrection is very apparent in the Mishnah where it gives a strong assertion that:<br /><br />* \\"He that says there is no resurrection of the dead prescribed in the Law.. has no share in the world to come\\" -Sanhedrin 10:1<br /><br />So, In Jewish thought, is the idea of Resurrection a foundational principle for faith?<br /><br />As to Aslan's declaration that there is no mention of any `three day' idea of resurrection; let me first say that the use of `three days' is often used throughout the law, prophets and Psalms:<br /><br />* God said to Moses: \\"Go to the people and consecrate them today [Mon] and tomorrow [Tues], and let them wash their garments; and let them be ready for the third day [Wed], for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.\\" Exodus 19:10-11<br />* Joseph revealing Himself to his brothers: Genesis 42:17-19 says \\"He put them all together intoward three days. And Joseph said unto them the third day, \\"This do, and live; ... go ye. ...\\"<br /><br />And then in Hosea, 6:1,2 it is brought home concerning physical resurrection of the people of God:<br /><br />* Hosea 6:1-2 states, 'Come, let us return to the LORD. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds. After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence.<br /><br />This is a word given to Israel as a whole, but the sequence is there: full restoration on the third day from being `torn to pieces' and `injured!' Obviously, the people of Israel have not experienced this three day promise of  Resurrection by God from such traumatic circumstances.  Could this find fulfillment in the promised One that was coming who would bear their sins in His own body and suffer on their behalf as Isaiah 53 clearly teaches?  He would become their substitute in punishment for sin.<br /><br />So, is a third day restoration from punishment taught by the Prophets?<br /><br />And as I already said, in the story of Abraham, who was asked to sacrifice his son Isaac: According to Genesis 22:4, it was on the third day that Abraham arrived at Mount Moriah and prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac-`Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, (Heb. 11:19) and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death'-and this took place on the third day.<br /><br />So, Is a third day deliverance from death by substitution taught by the Law?<br /><br />The Prophet Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days (a deathlike experience, to be sure!-cf. Jonah 2:1-9) before being spit out on dry land, and hence saved from his watery tomb (Jonah 1:17; 2:10). Jesus himself makes reference to this event in the context of his death and soon to be resurrection (see, e.g., Matt. 12:40); and declares that this is the only sign given to an unbelieving and adulterous generation.<br /><br />Aslan says Jesus didn't quote one scripture!<br /><br />So, is a third day deliverance from death taught by the Prophets?<br /><br />The third day  was the time set for the miraculous healing of King Hezekiah, who as a son of David serves as somewhat of a Messianic prototype (cf. Jewish thinking about this passage: Sanhedrin 94a, 98a):<br /><br />* 'Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, \\"This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the LORD\\"' (2 Kings 20:5; cf. also v. 8).<br /><br />So the idea of a divine intervention, taking place on the third day is well  documented throughout  the scriptures.  And the idea that this intervention would deliver the people of God from impending doom and death is also the focus on several occasions.<br /><br />And we have many other instances of the use of `three days' in the scriptures:<br /><br />* In the story of Esther, Esther stood before the king and appealed for mercy (Esther 5:1). After calling the people to fast for three days for divine intervention to save her Jewish people from annihilation, on the third day she approached the king!<br />* The building of the Second Temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar (Ezra 6:15).<br />* On the third day after Joseph interpreted the dreams of two of his fellow prisoners-both of whose dreams included a symbolic `three'-one of the men was hung and the other man restored to his former position (Gen. 40:1-23).<br />* Sacrifices left until the third day could no longer be eaten but were to be wholly consumed by the altar's flames (Lev. 7:17-18; 19:6-7).<br />* After three days the Israelites crossed the Jordan-by the miraculous intervention of God (Josh. 1:11; 3:2).<br /><br />The idea of Sacrificial death by substitution for sin on the behalf of Humankind, is all throughout the law of Moses; from the beginning pages of Genesis, through Deuteronomy! Throughout all the historical writings; throughout the Prophets,  the idea that fellowship with God is based upon the sacrificial death of the substitute, is foundational for faith.  Deliverance from the punishment of sin is to be carried by the substitute; He shall suffer on our behalf and be restored to life and glory!<br /><br />To all who are honestly investigating the evidence for Christianity, I would like to say that God's word is very clear about the idea of personal faith.  Faith must come from the heart and not be coerced. The fact is, God could demonstrate His power and cause the whole world to bow before Him! But He wouldn't have their hearts! It wouldn't be their free choice. Faith assumes discovery.  And the scriptures clearly bear out the struggle that Men and Women of faith have gone through, learning to trust God and obey His word.<br /><br />God is very clear about concealing evidence from the unbelieving:<br /><br />Isaiah 6:9  9 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Isaiah 6:10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.<br /><br />The New Testament witness is that Jesus spoke to the unbelieving with parables, to fulfill this prophecy of Isaiah! Even as the Apostle Paul said, God has hidden such things from the unbelieving heart:<br /><br />* 1 Corinthians 1:19-20  19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.  20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?<br />Job also brings out this idea:<br />* YLT Job 5:12 Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not execute wisdom.TNK Job 5:13 Who traps the clever in their own wiles; The plans of the crafty go awry.<br /><br />Aslan might declare that nowhere is there a legitimate witness for the resurrection in the law of Moses, Prophets, Psalms, nor in the entire history of Jewish thought; not one line of scripture that the Messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again on the third day. And He might say that Jesus doesn't cite one scripture to back up His claim.  And Yet when I read the bible, the evidence that contradicts this statement is overwhelming.<br /><br />Reza Aslan says<br /><br />* ....the fact remains that the resurrection is not a historical event.P 176<br />* ....Again, these stories are not meant to be accounts of historical events; they are carefully crafted rebuttals to an argument that is taking place offscreen. p177<br />* .... nowhere is any such thing written: not in the Law of Moses, not in the prophets, not in the Psalms. In the entire history of Jewish thought there is not a single line of scripture that says the messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again on the third day, which may explain why Jesus does not bother to cite any scripture to back up his incredible claim. P177<br /><br />I believe that the Fox news commentator Lauren Green  had every right to bring Reza Aslan's religion into the questioning of  his purpose in writing about Jesus this way.<br /><br />Reza Aslan, on television, makes this incredible declaration:<br /><br />* `just to be clear, this is not some attack on Christianity...'; `anyone thinks that this book is an attack on Christianity, has not read it yet'; `this is an academic work of history, not about The Christ, or about Christianity...'.<br /><br />Is this true?  Wouldn't it be a fair deduction, based upon the above comments that Aslan has made about the faith of Christianity, that Aslan is intentionally lying in this interview? That his remarks in this interview are nothing more than willful deception just to sell books and expose people to Muslim propaganda against Christianity?<br /><br />But true to Islamic belief, His use of deception is condoned in the writings he holds sacred. The following references in the Qur'an and Haddith seem to lead out such a conclusion:<br /><br />Qur'an (16:106) - Establishes that there are circumstances that can \\"compel\\" a Muslim to tell a lie.<br /><br />Qur'an (3:28) - This verse tells Muslims not to take those outside the faith as friends, unless it is to \\"guard themselves.\\"<br /><br />Qur'an (9:3) - \\"...Allah and His Messenger are free from liability to the idolaters...\\" The dissolution of oaths with the pagans who remained at Mecca following its capture.<br />Qur'an (40:28) - A man is introduced as a believer, but one who must \\"hide his faith\\" among those who are not believers.<br /><br />Qur'an (2:225) - \\"Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts\\"<br /><br />Qur'an (66:2) - \\"Allah has already ordained for you, (O men), the dissolution of your oaths\\"<br /><br />Qur'an (3:54) - \\"And they (the disbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed (against them): and Allah is the best of schemers.\\" The Arabic word used here for scheme (or plot) is makara, which literally means deceit. If Allah is deceitful toward unbelievers, then there is little basis for denying that Muslims are allowed to do the same. (See also 8:30 and 10:21)<br /><br />Haddith<br /><br />Bukhari (52:269) - \\"The Prophet said, 'War is deceit.'\\" The context of this is thought to be the murder of Usayr ibn Zarim and his thirty unarmed men by Muhammad's men after he \\"guaranteed\\" them safe passage (see Additional Notes below).<br /><br />Bukhari (49:857) - \\"He who makes peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a liar.\\" Lying is permitted when the end justifies the means.<br /><br />Bukhari (84:64-65) - Speaking from a position of power at the time, Ali confirms that lying is permissible in order to deceive an \\"enemy.\\"<br /><br />Bukhari (50:369) - Recounts the murder of a poet, Ka'b bin al-Ashraf, at Muhammad's insistence. The men who volunteered for the assassination used dishonesty to gain Ka'b's trust, pretending that they had turned against Muhammad. This drew the victim out of his fortress, whereupon he was brutally slaughtered despite putting up a ferocious struggle for his life.<br /><br />Taken collectively these verses are interpreted to mean that there are circumstances when a Muslim may be \\"compelled\\" to deceive others for a greater purpose. Such a conclusion seems fair considering these references.<br /><br />Reza Aslan speaks correctly when he says that Christianity rises or falls upon the idea of Resurrection. The Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15 that without it, the faith of Christian believers is worthless. Jesus staked the witness of his life upon this very principle that He would be crucified, and in three days, rise again from the dead.<br /><br />But isn't it also true, on the question of Jesus' resurrection, that Reza Aslan rises or falls, along with all others who try and discredit this Historical witness of God?<br /><br />People had better be prepared to stand before God and give reason for such an adversarial stance, because that is exactly what you are going to do! And you had better have something more substantial than a copy of Reza Aslan's book, The Zealot!<br /><br />John 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.<br /><br />PS<br />Reza Aslan's interview with fox news calls his claimed focus in education into question; [...]<br /><br />In this interview Aslan claims,<br /><br />\\"I am a scholar of religions with four degrees including one in the New Testament . . . I am an expert with a Ph.D. in the history of religions . . . I am a professor of religions, including the New Testament - that's what I do for a living, actually . . . To be clear, I want to emphasize one more time, I am a historian, I am a Ph.D. in the history of religions.\\"  None of which is true!<br /><br />Reza Aslan is an associate professor in the Creative Writing program at the University of California, Riverside.  He teaches there based on his Master of Fine Arts degree in fiction from Iowa, his relevant academic credential.<br />In addition, Reza Aslan received his PhD in sociology - not \\"History of Religions\\" - from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2009.<br /><br />Reading one of the many examinations of this man's claims, one particular writer said this:<br /><br />\\"I used to teach at the University of California at Santa Barbara and I am familiar with the prominent theologians, professors and academic scholars at the school. None of these individuals that I met considered Reza Aslan even remotely close to being a scholar in religion. After all, he received his PhD in sociology. At first, I did not know of Reza Aslan. But when his name was brought up, I asked a director of one the departments at the university - who prefers to remain anonymous - for more information. He stated simply that Reza Aslan is a hungry self-promoter who begs for media attention and appearances, and who repeatedly misrepresents his credentials. He added that it goes without saying that Reza Aslan is laughed at within scholarly circles, and that academics do not consider Reza Aslan even a minor religious scholar.\\"<br /><br />His PHD dissertation was titled \\"global Jihadism as a Transnational Social Movement: A Theoretical Framework.\\"  He is an advisory board member of the National Iranian American Council, a group that has been described by Iranian dissidents under oath as a \\"front group\\" for the Iranian government. Aslan also has a long history of downplaying the dangers of jihadist groups, specifically denying the extremism of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.<br /><br />He calls himself a historian, yet he has never attained a degree or had professional training in history. He isredefining himself as a New Testament expert and historian of the highest rank, qualified to critique Jesus of the Gospels, when in fact he is not. He has just repackaged outmoded ideas; previous attempts many years ago, by Schweitzer and others, who tried to challenge the bible's historical record; ideas which have already been refuted and abandoned.<br /><br />His book is attracting so much attention, probably because so many in our world today are looking for a way to confirm the validity of their unbelief.
006202406X|4.0|Like many readers of this series I too wanted the Hollywood, perfect ending where Tobias and Tris run off into the sunset holding hands.  But in this story that did not happen.  If you really think about all the danger that the two of them were placed in time and time again, something was bound to happen.  With all the death happening all around them, was it fair that the two of them were to remain in love and unscathed? (I wish they did)  Tris' sacrifice had to happen.  That was the character that she was.  Through tears I finished this book, sad at the ending, wishing it would have been my perfect ending but that is not the world these characters lived in.  Still loved this series and luckily I can just go back and reread them to bring Tris and Tobias back together again.

B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I wish the easy level was a little easier so the kids could play too. It ranges from easy to insane and is fun to play. Children like to play it but get frustrated because they are unable to win. The easy is a little hard for them. Sometimes it is hard to move but overall is not bad.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Some of Cat Stevens best songs are immediately identifiable, as if you've been hearing them all of your life (Longer Boats, Father and Son, Moonshadow,etc.).Tea for the Tillerman is a classic of the early 70's singer-songwriter idiom ( Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Carole King etc.) If that's your cup of tea, you should enjoy this. 2000 remaster is crystal clear.
B004GE81CK|5.0|Masters of melody, the Brothers Gibb had made records in Australia, but this is their international debut.These are 14 original compositions, at times Beatlesque, baroque, and/or psych pop. The first 12 tunes are wonderful, but Please Read Me is a let down and Close Another Door is saved in the last 74 seconds by Robins' over the top vocal.The stereo mix has the vocals clear and upfront.

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|THis is just a fun game. You have this little blue guy that looks like a thumb that you have to save from a variety of dumb ways to die. You do things like stop the bleeding by putting your finger on the holes, tap the screen to make him run away from fire, connect strings to balloons so the little guy doesn't go out in traffic etc etc. This is hilarious.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|Each Paranormal Activity is like a copy of a copy. Some interesting/inventive ideas (like the use of the Xbox Kinect in infrared) and concept of using multiple laptop's cam's for secret recording was savvy. Some jumps and creepy moments, but definitely a far cry from the first one. Not horrible, not great, but wanted to &#34;complete&#34; the series (noting that at least one more is coming).
