B009SJ3GUK|2.0|It us very disappointing after watching the first season of AHS. It is as if the writers are just trying too hard to make it violent, gory and disturbing.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I purchased this for my husband along with a kindle fire for christmas. He loves it.<br />Really a good buy
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Like I said, the 2 littles (under 5 and ADD) sat still for the movie, they liked Doug best, but Ellie was my favorite.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I couldn't help thinking that this is only a review of the original novel contained within a rather flimsy new structure - an Austen sandwich on James, perhaps, without the wit.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|The littles like it. I don't see much of educational, moral, intellectual, etc value...but eye candy is fun once in a while, I suppose.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a great read, appropriate for everyone middle school through adult. It teaches you that you shouldn't judge by appearance, but by what is on the inside. It also shows just how strong a parents quick judgements can affect their child.
B005LFQRTC|3.0|Season One of the Six Million Dollar Man is very interesting viewing for a number of reasons and while it doesn't rank with the Season Two or Three Seasons in terms of overall quality, this may be an unfair comparison in some ways.<br /><br />The First Pilot Episode and the two other pilots included before Regular Series Episodes started production provide the introduction to this great series.  The actual first pilot episode details his accident and reconstruction to bionics.  While well acted and an excellent story, you really do notice the missing \\"Bionic\\" sound effects that were so essential to the show.  This is most evident during his clumsy and laborious first attempt to use bionics to save a little boy trapped in a car about to blow up... The original Intelligence Organization Leader in this one was one Oliver Spencer, played by Darren McGavin who does a really great job as a crusty leader.  The Spencer character would rather have a robot than a part man/part machine agent because of Steve's human emotions getting in the way of total efficiency.  It would have been really interesting to see these two characters develop their relationship over time but D. McGavin (who seemed to be filming his \\"Kolchak-Night Stalker\\" Series around the same time)was apparently only along for the first pilot. The same goes for the first of the three Doctor Rudy Wells, ably played this first time by Martin Balsam.<br /><br />The Second Pilot is really nothing like the eventual series at all and this is entitled \\"Wine Women and War\\".  It appears as though they initially envisioned the Steve Austin Character as a Bionic James Bond with all the trimmings (heavily accented ladies to kiss, white tuxedo and the water and boat scene seems straight out of \\"Thunderball\\") There is also a different and terrible theme song introduced in this one to accompany a pilot that drags considerably throughout.  Fortunately, the song and this approach was a quickly passing phase although the \\"Bond\\" concept is somewhat continued in the third pilot (\\"The Solid Gold Kidnapping\\")with a SPECTRE like Counter Intelligence Organization, led by Maurice Evans of \\"Planet of the Apes\\" Dr. Zaius Fame! (sans makeup) The story is better in this one but they were still apparently working out the bugs of the series concepts.<br /><br />Once you get through a mixed bag in terms of these three separate pilot episodes, the regular \\"Season One\\" Episodes emerge and there are some good ones to be sure.  \\"Day of the Robot\\" introduces the Robot Adversary built by Dr. Chester Dolenz, who appears in two episodes in year one (\\"Run Steve Run\\" is the other) with the Robot played by 70's Stalwart John Saxon.  This episode also introduces the famous \\"Bionic Sound\\" although it is the Robot who uses it first...  \\"Dr. Wells is Missing\\" is a suspenseful episode set in Austria and which features the second \\"Dr Rudy Wells\\" played by Alan Oppenheimer.  \\"Population Zero\\" is a solid entry that deals with a disgruntled former OSI Scientist out to get revenge since he pet projects didn't get off the drawing board...  For Star Trek Fans, two alumni show up with William Shatner (Captain Kirk) in a lead Role (yep, he plays a spaceman but in our time period) in \\"Burning Bright\\" which features some of his classic over the top theatrics.  Also, George Takei (Mr. Sulu)appears briefly in a solid episode set primarily in Asia entitled \\"The Coward\\"  This same episode also introduces Steve's Mother who would pop up from time to time in the series.  \\"Little Orphan Airplane\\" is a good one too, set in Africa, where Steve A. tangles with local army elements and assists a pair of Nuns who are caught up in the warring factions.  Greg Morris from \\"Mission Impossible\\" Fame shows up in this one and one of the nuns will be recognizable from her role as a motherly nun in \\"The Flying Nun\\"!<br /><br />Not a bad first season for a very memorable show!ncept is somewhat continued in the third pilot (\\"The Solid Gold Kidnapping\\")with a SPECTRE like Counter Intelligence Organization, led by Maurice Evans of \\"Planet of the Apes\\" Dr. Zaius Fame!

B004LUS390|5.0|Definitely worth the 2 dollars! There are features on here I totally did not expect that were very pleasant surprises, mainly the Copic color pallet and the layers. also I really appreciate the variety of tools/brushes and how design of the app is clean and simplistic. Very professional!

Frankl's logotherapy approach shows great insight into man's struggle to find purpose while giving hope and enlightenment.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Got kinda long here and there.  But overall a pretty good book. The first two were really good.  It's worth the read
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I am an adult who enjoys animated films from time to time. This was very well done. The heroine personified every little girl's dream of being a heroine at some time.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I absolutely love Ellen, so I purchased the book, but I was disappointed in it.  I was bored ready it.  Guess it's better when you see and hear her instead of reading about her.  I haven't even read the whole book.  I put it down.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Such an obvious play on the original Dark Shadows, which was much more sinister. Actually a very funny video, maybe a real groaner.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is the only book on the market telling the story with an accurate portrayal of the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden from the viewpoint of an actual team member. This book lived up to the hype and more.  The story describes Mark Owen's experiences that led him to be a Navy Seal, outlining missions that eventually led to the opportunity of a lifetime.  I must warn that as soon as you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it back down. Owen writes with a style of sense and urgency, keeping you on the edge of your seat and always anticipating the next event.  If you're looking for a quick-read, this book is for you. Despite all of the on-going discrepancy with Owen revealing classified military information, i did not learn any thing new in terms of tactics and strategies other than the details of the Osama mission.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a good plot.  I generally figure the mystery out pretty early in the plot but admit this one did catch me by surprise.<br /><br />Seemed a bit unrealistic but then again, reading is an escape from reality.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I missed the original theatre 3D experience and have really enjoyed seeing the 3d effects on my 3d television. Great movie.

0765325950|5.0|Ignore all one star reviews. They are unfairly reviewing a product they didn't read because they couldn't get an e-reader version. Way to screw up the reviews because of unrelated issues people....<br /><br />I loved Wheel of Time and this book was a great way to end the series. I think Sanderson has done a good job finishing up the story based on Jordan's notes. I won't spoil anything, but I thought it was great. I'm sad to see the story end, but it all good things must end I guess.

B000EUDAWG|4.0|I read the reviews and knew what to expect when giving this as a gift to my BF for Christmas.  He had to make an adjustment to the wheels because the rubber rings on them were too thin and wouldn't allow the spider to work on his wood floors but after that it was great.

It was ok But no better or worse than any other child movie.....<br /><br />But just like that Dumb Van-pier movie the Twilight Saga I think it;s all pretty dumb and I do not get why so many go crazy over a kid with a Magic Wand  and riding broom sticks..<br /><br />Maybe for a kid, it would be ok, but really, what is wrong with you people,,,,no wonder this world is so messed up with people, liking the movie that is so dumb, but owe'well to each his own....

B000002J03|5.0|Famously recorded episodically in various UK & US studios during the band's 1969 tour, Led Zeppelin 2 features some of their strongest and most enduring work. It was their first number one album in both the UK & the US (and elsewhere) and eventually sold more than 12 million copies worldwide.<br /><br />Here you can experience the young band getting into their stride, with a maturity and confidence to match the exuberance evident on the first album. The opener `Whole Lotta Love' heralds a parade of cracking, energetic rock-blues numbers, the star turn for many fans Page's awesome guitar break on `Heartbreaker'.<br /><br />For the first time Plant penned both lyrics and melodies and the result is a more interesting & varied group of songs than on the debut album. Plant's interest in folk music and the works of JRR Tolkien can be heard especially on `Ramble On' - themes which re-emerge on subsequent albums especially `Battle of Evermore' on LZ4. This gives LZ2 more light & shade than the debut; it's a more varied listening experience.<br /><br />Also featured is `Moby Dick', an opportunity for Bonzo to show off his drumming skills. Unfortunately the 20-minute on-stage drum solo too frequently became an example of 1970s excess; here though it's tight & contained, and lasts only a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The cover photo is from 1917 of Jagdstaffel 11, the Red Baron's squadron; this was the age of the Zeppelin, hence the relevance. You can see the sepia-toned faces of the band members superimposed on four of the figures, and others of Miles Davis and Neil Armstrong (the Apollo 11 Moon landing was in July 1969) among the party.<br /><br />If there ever was a `classic rock album' then this is it. If possible play loud on a good old-fashioned analogue hi-fi system, preferably on vinyl for the extra richness & `warmth' - as another reviewer said of this album, if you're able to physically lift your speakers with your own strength then they're too small for this music.system, preferably on vinyl for the extra richness & `warmth' - as another reviewer somewhere said of this album, if you're able to physically lift your speakers with your own strength, then they're too small for this music.

This app does just that as I can choose between many variations to create stations that I can return to later, via the 'favorites' part of the app. There are a lot of features that I haven't explored yet, but I am very happy with the choices so far. Well worth the cost...free!!

1475143389|5.0|I've been working out on-and-off for about 18 months, including picking up road cycling as a sport.  Results have been that I lost nearly 20lb and have gotten notably stronger.  But I've plateaued for almost a year.  I realized that I needed to do something different from what I was doing -- working out two or three times a week, taking weeks off at a time, cycling 75mi-100mi a week, but paying no attention to my diet.  I wasn't getting bigger, strength was increasing slowly, and although I kept off the 20lb, I wasn't getting any leaner and was not getting the definition in my midsection and all-around that I wanted.  I was definitely not getting ripped!<br /><br />I've read this BLS book cover-to-cover and it simply makes sense.  It requires a disciplined approach to training and diet, something I intuitively knew I had to do, but I lacked the direction.  In two days, I was able to establish a new training routine and diet regiment.  I'm just now starting, so I'll report back in a few months with the progress I realize through BLS.<br /><br />But first impression in reading BLS is that it espouses solid training fundamentals. No gimmicks, no faddish dieting, no weird stuff.  And it tells you exactly what to do.  Perfect for me!  5 stars based on this, but again, I'll update this review with my results.
B000WQWPKA|1.0|I'm one of Amazon's biggest fans. I LOVE Amazon.....and I usually love their pricing too. However this blu-ray is overpriced.<br /><br />I've been looking for this one for a while, but didn't want to pay $25 bucks! It's an older movie and frankly not worth that much. You can find some new release 3D blu-rays for around that price.<br /><br />Anyway I found it at Best Buy (which usually has ridiculously high pricing) for $7.99. Granted, it was on sale.... but still.<br /><br />Anyway. Love the movie but hate the price.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|My grandpa is hard to shop for, and saw this movie and loved it! He didn't have enough money for it and was sad about it. So I got it for him for Christmas and he loved it! Good buy! Fast delivery!
B007U4DB4G|4.0|I haven't seen the first or second Beverly Hills Chihuahua but the third is pretty funny. I bought it for my 3 year old daughter, she loves the movie, there was also a free plush toy offer when I purchased this movie, so that persuaded me to buy it. Overall a fun watch for the family.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good book but odd.  Trying to figure out if I want to read the rest of the series. It is enough to keep you engaged throughout the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An excellent addition to the hunger games saga. This book truly does what the title implies and builds this story into a tinder box that certainly, \\"catches fire\\".
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It started slow and depressing but got better and better. I absolutely LOVED the ending! I highly recommend this book!
B000KJZWMW|5.0|Maybe not the best movie ever but it is really good. Supercharged Falcon, flying machine and a bleak outlook for the future.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book I just couldn't put down.I was addicted to it I had to know what was going to happen next!!
B0050R0YB8|3.0|The price was reasonable and delivery was prompt and with good tracking.<br /><br />However the box that i received had slight tear on the surface prints. If amazon knows its product well, it should be familiar that this line of lego products are known as Ultimate Collector Series.<br /><br />It is more like a collectable than a toy. I would have hoped that Amazon would have send out a box without any damage. ( i can tolerate damage that are caused by the shipping company as these are beyond amazon control but the box had tear on the surface of the printing is not so acceptable to me...
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are great, didn't' want to put it down. Finished the first and fixing to buy the other one. I'm a Snark Buster!
B007V5CF5K|2.0|One of the item's needed cannot be reach since it is on the very edge of the screen. Since you cannot retrieve it the game is now unplayable.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love Nelson DeMille books! However this book is not one of his best. It has all the making of a great DeMille book, but it just did not hook me. It has taken me for ever to read (a this writ ting I have not finished) this book. I stopped once and completed another book hich was a free book. I will finish this book. It is classic DeMille just not fully cooked...... maybe? Finally got to the DeMille I love.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is hilarious & this book is no different. Love her show, love her book, love her! Said all I need to... now just fulfilling the twenty word requirement.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|It is overall pretty good on blu ray but I do wish it had doctor cometary on it but again it is pretty good1
B003YWPN08|5.0|I think it is one of the Great War movies of all time! Better even than the longest day ok.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy it now so cool and everyone is talking about the new year of Mine Craft best app ever buy the new complete version for the best app ever
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Alex Pettyfer is sooooo hot!!!! I would recommend this movie to everyone!!! This movie also has a great movie plot to it!!! (Nd of course the stripping) this movie is by far my favorite movie!!! GO BUY IT!!!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It  is hard 2 find things and sometimes I don't know if it's just a caption or a definition.  Just need a couple more words
1439102430|5.0|Kathy Reichs' books flow from start to finish. She has a knack for keeping the story line smooth, a difficult task when there is so much science and detail within a story line. Her books are educational, intriguing and definitely thrillers. I couldn't put it down!
0399157565|4.0|This was a really good read. Despite working full-time and having a small business on the side, I still managed to finish this book in 2 days. I would drive home thinking about it. The Brennan series has had some ups and downs lately. The story lines being good but a lack of passion coming through from the author. At least that's how it has come across. This was the best book I've read of Cornwells in a while, maybe in the last three books. At the same time, the last couple chapters felt like she was frantically tying up the loose ends. You know rationally that a book is coming to an end but I don't like the feeling of being rushed or having to turn back a few pages because I've gotten lost in the story line. Overall, it was a great read, a well thought out story, one that sucked me in, and this book showed some of the passion in the writing that came through in Cornwell's earlier books.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|The book is funny, smart and very compelling. I could not put it down once I started it, and personally, being a fan it helped me get to know the boys in depth. Even if you are not a fan I would recommend the book for it's entertainment value.
0810989956|5.0|IT came it good shape and the grandchild loved it. Would order again if I need to buy another gift.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I always love John Green 's books. I get so excited when people ask me for suggestions on what they should read next. Now this will be a nee suggestion! Great read as expected!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It deserves this rating for pulling you into the book and wanting you to read more so thrilling and exciting
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopelessly amazing, heart touching story. I loved every minute and every emotion of it. I look forward to new books from this author!
B007RE0RR8|3.0|o trae pedestal eso le baja mucha categoria, y se ve muy pobre si accesorios. mas o menos.:( NO LA RECOMIENDO.
B0016492BW|3.0|This player plays other discs, other Panasonic player plays this disc.  The combination is not working though.  A great movie I would love to watch on both players I own!<br /><br />Maybe 5 stars later...
B006LRUVUA|4.0|I was recently given a fancy ASUS wireless router with all sorts of remote access options. I have a couple of laptops and a nexus 7 that I'd like to have mutual file access when I'm away from home. Getting the new router setup has been a battle to get working for sharing.<br /><br />TeamViewer has been amazingly easy to achieve much of what I'm looking for. The sharing of files instructions can be a little confusing but the function is impressive when it works.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I had no idea how much I was going to love this movie!  My kids are between the ages of 3 and 10 and they all sat through it and watched it, several times!<br /><br />Makes me want to go out and plant a tree!  :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I initially held off reading this because I thought it would be lacking a good story. I was pleasantly surprised, and I am now glad that I have read all three books. It goes to show, you can't judge a book until you actually read it.
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|I have 3 children between the ages of 3 and 10 and I had major surgery a little over a month ago so we have watched more animated films in the last month than ever before!  This movie is one the kids keep asking for again.  I'm sure it won't become a classic in our home but it's worth a \\"few\\" viewings!<br /><br />Anyway, to each their own, but in my opinion it's worth a chance!
B00846REIS|3.0|It's would be better if I hadn't read 50 Shades. I feel like the author used a thesaurus. Same story line, different words/names. Cross lost cool points when he asked Eva to sleep with him. Christian was much smoother. I liked his chase-approach better. Still reading Bared; however, not impressed thus far.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|My son was not expecting this for Christmas. I was glad to be able to get it for him and it was exactly what he was looking for, especially since it was Blu Ray!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting views of people, relationships, in a thoughtfull way.  Almost like a modern western.  There are more planned and I want more :-)
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My daughter just loves Taylor Swift and she asked for this for Christmas. I was glad to be able to find it and get it so quickly.
0345528581|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in bodyweight exercises.  The pictures are quite helpful and the routines are challenging.  this book is a great standalone product.  doesn't need to be paired with any other resource.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun i even just goy an upgrade for a new place but things keep popping  up and i have to get out
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is really fun and addicting!!!! I play it all the time. everyone should get it its even free!!!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The &#34;YouVersion&#34; ap has become the way that I have my daily devotions.  It is easy to setup daily reading plans that allow me to use my Kindle or phone to stay current. I would recommend this ap.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought this item just for the fact that I needed a serrated blade sharpener, and in that respect, it is great. For straight blades... not so much, the positioning of the sharpening grooves is kind of dicey, it made me nervous to be running a blade in them so close to my fingers. As I said, if you need to sharpen a SERRATED blade, it's a good buy.
B005K17RU0|2.0|This ap would not work on my Kindle fire. It may have been something that I did. But I just gave up trying to use it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The book was great and full of exciting twists and mysteries.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in Greek mythology
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think littlest pet shop is so fun even if it downloads 72.53 mb because  it is so fun and the animals are so cute!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very entertaining. Nice graphics, but hate that you get halfway into the game and you have to purchase it to continue.
B003QSMC18|1.0|2 days is too little for my busy schedule to watch or stream this rental before it expired on me.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Mark of athena was amazing its a real cliffhanger at the end i cant wait till house of hades coming out this fall!!!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|this is always a great family movie.  it went over well with my family.  great gift to share. thank you.<br />candace s.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I really enjoy the game. Only tried solo campaign so far. Will be trying multiplayer soon. Been playing for hours and still on first set of equipment.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|i have not rated a movie 5 stars ever!  it's message is deep, the characters are memorable, and the ending is perfection.  mads is the man!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love it.<br />Look forward to the next one. Can't wait to see how it all ends...<br />See you after the last one..
B004529NKC|5.0|I really love all of the step up movies. I smile through the whole show. They are a lot of fun to watch and have absolutely amazing talent in them.
0300169787|5.0|Daughter in law was thrilled. word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word.
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|This was a quick read with excellent insight about change an  ho  best to accomplish it. I will use the  eight  steps outlined to hopefully being about a much needed change in my community. Thank you!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So helpful in writing notes and stories, I am constantly working on it and am very glad with the outcome.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This was possibly the worst movie I've seen...it was at least in the top five. It was filled with unnecessary, gratuitous violence. I'm a huge SciFi fan, and I watch plenty of gory shows and movies, but this was ridiculous. It was boring and disturbing all at the same time. The storyline was illogical and insulted the intelligence of the viewer. There were major concepts that were treated in a &#34;just pretend we explained this part to you&#34; kind of way. It is a SciFi movie that didn't bother to put the effort into fleshing out the actual SciFi part of the plot. The second half of the movie was unexpected and came out of nowhere....very disjointed.  Small children were shot....which is never o.k. If this is fits the definition of entertainment, then we are a deprived society. This movie stayed with you for a while...not in a thought-provoking way, but rather more like a lingering disgusting scent that you can't get out of your clothing.  I will watch anything and everything (other than supernatural movies or those in which children are abused or killed), and this movie was trash. Don't watch it. You can't get back those hours of your life...
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Very disappointed that season 2 was not a continuation of season 1.  I just liked that story and the characters much better.  I haven't finished season 2 yet... 2 episodes to go.  However, I don't think it will change how I feel.  Great acting in both.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Yes, this sounds very similar to the Secret and the Power but, it's the way Rhonda Byrne expresses herself in each book that separates then. She is gifted. She has woven mysteries and truths within the tapestry of proven methods. I love it!
B00002E224|2.0|But I didn't connect with the actors...it just didn't seem sincere or all it is cracked up to be to me.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. It arrived well within the arrival date range and plays as it should.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|How refreshing to listen to a true artist, I bought the DVD too. A top notch band, some humor and insight from Leonard and new takes on familiar, much loved songs.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I think anyone out there would like this book a a a a a a a a a a a
B0053KWDES|5.0|I was trying to decide between the E11 and the one with the built in DAC (don't remember what it was called). As I was going to be using it for my iPod and iPad only, I decided to go with this one and I have to say I'm very impressed with it. I've been using it with a pair of PSB M4U 2 headphones and they sound great.<br /><br />I was also concerned that the amp would feel cheap, but was pleasantly surprised with the build quality.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is amazing it lets u edit out blemishes and make your teeth whiter and change your eye color!!!!!!! :) I like it becauce it is better than instagram!
034580404X|5.0|I got the set for a friend's Christmas Gift and they were so excited ........Great Book Triology especially for  females. My two friends are in their 20's ...... loved the series..............as I did..
B005LAIIJY|5.0|FORGET ALL THE BS--THE PERCEIVED VIOLENCE, THE PERCEIVED RACIAL ISSUES and whatever other PERCEIVED issues that are internalized by insecurity, ignorance, prejudices and sundry altered states and accept this for what it is--a MOVIE. AND A DARN GOOD ONE. Slavery in this country was evil and violent and the language used in this movie was state of the art at the time. Judge this movie for what it is, not for individual PERCEPTIONS (or misconceptions).<br />THAT SAID, EVERYTHING about this MOVIE is BRILLIANT. The Entire cast (EVERYONE). ESPECIALLY, LEONARDO DICAPRIO.  HONORABLE MENTION, CRISTOPH WALTZ--STELLAR, and SAMUEL L. JACKSON.  JAMIE FOXX, who excels at everything he does, plays a restrained character (much of the time). And, let's not forget beautiful KERRY WASHINGTON in an effecting, nuanced performance. The screenplay is excellent and the soundtrack couldn't be better. The cinematography is exquisite. The violence is mostly blood splatter stuff (not chopped off body parts or cannibalism)--MOST of it is gunfight stuff. There's lots of that, but that's the DJANGO GENRE. As in Tarantino's Quirky PERSONNA, there is abundant LEVITY (HUMOR).<br />QUENTIN TARANTINO is A GENIUS FILMMAKER. WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY SAME. He's A MAJOR STAR. TARANTINO has the ability to REALLY SEE and MAKE IT HAPPEN. BRAVO. ACCOLADES FOR EVERYONE.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I LOVED IT!! I LOVE HOW PERCY LOST HIS MEMORY TOO!!!!this book is exciting and daring and it makes my heart race. It tells a story of love and sacrifice. It's also extremely funny. The 2 New characters, hazel and Frank, make me want to laugh and cry at the same time. You will love them!! READ THIS BOOK NOW!!!;):D
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. Nicholas Sparks makes you believe in love,and the best kind at that
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great movie. It gives a look into how things could be in the future if time travel were plausible. Very entertaining to watch.
B0056AEJTC|3.0|I didn't know that ordering a DVD from the UK that I wouldn't be able to play it on my DVd player I am sure the movie is good but since I couldn't watch it I just gve it an ok. of coarse the person I ordered it from is refunding me my money though amazon and I have sent the DVD back
B006VREOOY|2.0|DeNiro was terrible. He is supposed to be a professional killer yet he acts like a worried mother throughout the film. Not a believable role.
B008QTV3X0|3.0|WHile certainly a quality television offering, I thinky the hype was a little bit much for this pilot.  I'll likely watch the rest of the series, but I was underwhelmed by the first installment.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|What a feel good read. Enjoyed very much! Funny and touches all the right buttons. Great read to grab a cup of good coffee curl up in your favorite spot on rainy gloomy day, smile and enjoy!  Feel good read!
B001USHRCK|5.0|We're big into the Kingdoms series which sadly is going away.  This may be our last purchase of the series.  My daughter enjoyed putting it together and enjoyed the additions to her story of King Peter's family.  The animals in this kit were a great hit with her as well.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Easy to read...never want it to end. Brings history to life. Can't wait to finish Follet's trilogy. Winter of the World is as good as Fallen Giants.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again! The end was the best part and I can't wait for the movies to come out!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app! And very fast!! Will use often! It is user friendly and easy to navigate.  Love this app! Give it a try.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I play a lot of these games and I really like this one. I have played it several times. I like the fact that it can be reset to play it again.
B001DD0HPG|5.0|Julian Bream is in my opinion the greatest classical guitarist and a musician of the highest order.<br />His tone and musical expression is unmatched.
B007SGM084|4.0|I purchased 50 Shades Trilogy because of all the hype. I wasn't expecting the type of graphics but by the second book the story kicked in and it was interesting. I flew through the first two books in 3 days. I don't usually reread books but I might reread this one.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|So far watched Season One. Excellent. Maggie is magnificent. One key lesson &#34;Be sure your sin will find you out.&#34; This lesson is seen again and again throughout the first season. Looking forward to watching Season Two and the shift to WWI. Music and cinematography are brilliant.
B0042816YK|5.0|My Daughter must have watched this movie a million times. Thought it would be worn out by now. I was wrong!

B00092ZMDY|5.0|My father is a hugh fan of the Eagles!  Watched the show with him and really enjoyed. They play all the greastest hits.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game on my Kindle Fire. It has both easy levels and very challenging levels. Very glad I got the app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Ive been playing this thrum Facebook for a long time. I hats I had to start from scratch but I'm glad I was able to get it on my kindle.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app for android.  Also have it on my kindle...works great.  Excellent for people who travel.  Use it daily.
1579128149|5.0|I think this is a very informative and fun to read book. The pictures are great and there are a lot of interesting facts.
B003EYVY04|5.0|Really, really great video. A must for any Sci-Fi Fantasy film collection and great family entertainment. It is wild to watch all these kids grow up on film.
1451695195|1.0|I picked up this book with an open mind because it was recommended to me by religious friends. It didn't take very long until I started to catch the bias tone of the book. I kept reading because I thought that an educated man of science would list proof or something concrete that goes beyond the imagination, I was again disappointed. This is just another Narcissist book that is commonly used by the religious faction in arguments. Don't consider this book as proof any more than the bible itself. Read it if you want to know what I mean, otherwise it's safe for you to skip. I recommend reading Richard Dawkin's book \\"The God Delusion\\" and his other work and Daniel Kahneman's \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\".
B000O76T9A|5.0|Another sci-fi great from Marvel. Has alot of action for anyone who likes action. This is really great for any collection and I would recommend for anybody.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this to calculate fuel mileage with each tank of fuel on my Kindle.  I used to use the calculator in my phone but it's just getting too small.  This is easy to use and doesn't have all those buttons that I have no idea what they mean.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|I chose this rating because it is a really good movie and I would recommend it to anyone that like action and sci-fi. We all grew reading Marvel comics and to see these super heros on film now is really coo.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book series, great book, the story between christian and ana continues with exciting new challenges and you get to hear some flash backs from the wedding and what could have been missed between book 2 &3
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina tells her story in a extremely entertaining and funny way.  It's well worth reading and is hard to put down.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This show is so good! Matt Bomer is hot and if that isn't reason enough to watch just watch the first episode and you will be hooked.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|An awfully written book. The story line was shallow, and it had underdeveloped characters. As a woman I hated it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game with surprising twists and turns!  Great puzzles plus the story line keeps you interested as you move through the levels.
B0039TAHMA|3.0|It was good but still a bit boring. But it definitely made me look forward to the last movie in the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read, couldn't put it down! I strongly recommend this book! I am going to see what else this authors has!
1419705849|5.0|My students are in reading groups and I bought these at their request.  They absolutely love reading the entire series.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Our son got this for Christmas and he loves it. It shoots far and fast.<br /><br />It does take batteries, but so far does not seem to go threw a lot of them.<br /><br />One thing that we did not notice until it arrived is that it does not come with all the dart clips that it can hold. It came with 4 clips, it holds 8. Nerf has an expansion pack to fully load the gun.<br /><br />So far a great product that has held up well.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|This is my (our) first ever e-book.  I bought it as a surprise gift for my wife (who is a hair/makeup artist), and she loves it.  Very handy, and I'm sure she'll be reading it on the plane, as we head to our next road-trip photo shoot destination in San Francisco.<br /><br />Jared and Jenny
030716327X|5.0|I bought this book for my grandchildren and have now purchased it for my first great grandchild.  I have never read it to a youngster who wasn't intriqued with the story and the way to participate by feeling and touching.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was typical Grisham. Easy read, interesting plot, engaging characters. I read all his books and am eager for the next one.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I only like to use this because if you want to transfer the video to music this app can let ypu do that
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|excellent search tool ,I would recommend to every one. My reason for liking this app is that  it is easy to use.<br /><br />'
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Such a great way to use facebook, love it is so handy, open the pad and its right there at a touch.  thanks  amazon for making this so easy.
076115678X|5.0|I bought another copy for each of my sisters and my daughter....  All of us each blesses/cursed with curly hair.  We each loved the book for giving tips and insight into how best to work with our hair and how to appreciate it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoy this books! I read them way to fast though, especially on my kindle fire hd!! Just as good as the first book!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Every Christmas season I watch various versions of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; either on TV or as movies and I just wanted to remind myself of what the original was as to structure and storyline as each of the movie versions has its own take on the import of the story.<br /><br />Charles Dickens crafts a wonderful story that should be read by all to remind us of the wonderfulness of the season
B009FB3W3W|5.0|He sounds awesome on the music plastic! Originally thought this was the glow in the dark (no where did it say it was, I just thought they all were) but it was normal black. Love it!
B009MF56GC|5.0|lots of  fun to watch never takes itself serious good interaction & plenty of action !Hope there is a next expendables (3)
B004IY1AKS|5.0|Ozzy and the gang sound amazing on vinyl and in my opinion should only be heard on vinyl. Only the best!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Still love this music all these years later.  Glad I found it.  Please keep adding to your library and I will keep buying.
B001EPIIMC|5.0|This (in my opinion) is, by far, their best album. It includes the big songs like misty mountain tops and rock and roll. What more could you want?
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Love this new sound.  Very now.  You will enjoy.  Give it a try.  More mainstream sound that also works for adults.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the series and i love the story, but the proof reading should have been better. I found several grammatical errors in all three books.  I was a little disappointed on how the book kind of raced through towards the end, it left me with a lot of questions.
B00138GZAC|5.0|Brought back some good memories and makes me sing along which makes me feel happy.  Highly recommended.  Still good after all these years.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the story line, it's not about the bad Christian Grey, ti's about how Anastasia releases the awesome Christian Grey!  Guys should read this book.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Like most of these songs.  Brought back some good memories.  I hear he still sounds good live too.  Thank you.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|what can you say about Nicholas Sparks books that you havent heard.  Love him and all his books. Never been dissapointed by any of his and I have read all.  Waiting for the next one...
B005DOJ68K|4.0|Still love this music all these years later.  Glad I found it.  Please keep adding to your library and I will keep buying.
0525953728|5.0|bought this as a gift for my husband ( who i have never seen read a book in the 30 years we have been married). Couldnt put it down and loved it...
B000VHMF0A|3.0|Makes me think of my Caribbean island vacations which brought back some good memories.  Good one to have in your library.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love these books.  Thoiught it was a great read and finished in no time.  I know the hype was about the sex, but Love learning about what made Christian they way he was.
B00367MB3I|4.0|Like most of the songs.  Love her voice.  So sensual and sexy.  Would love to have seen some of my other faves on this compilation.
B005LAII80|1.0|This was a blind buy having seen so many positive reviews...and was looking forward to it.<br />I simply couldnt wait until it was over.<br />Its based on the comic and Ill just take the word for it that it follows it closely.<br />I found the film to very dry, uninteresting , lack of character depth, just a lot of dull no frills no personality people shooting each other for 90 minutes. Its a drug bust film where Dredd attempts to stop the MaMa gang( or whatever they are called) from spreading this reality altering drugs. I was hoping for something along the lines of Robocop and Die Hard - instead I got the 2013 Manos the Hands of Fate worst film Ive seen yet. 90 minutes of frowning faces as if the characters didnt like being in the film either.<br />Yes its supposed to be dark, grim, but even Batman had a little light in the darkness. This had nothing going for it. At least to me. Another film that just depends on one's tastes.<br />Helpful or not, I am just sharing my opinion and should not deter anyone curious enough to watch, such as me for example<br />I can only say I watched the Blu Ray non 3D version since I do not have the capability. If nothing else, the HD transfer on this film was spectacular.<br />**while comments are fine and dandy , if anyone leave a comment please dont insult or call people names to either this reviewer or those who who disagree with me, that is not cool. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and that should be respected.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Previously I read every John Grisham book that came out but for awhile his books became very wordy and less intrigue. This book reminds me more of some of his first work and I loved it!
0345529057|3.0|I bought this set last week and received it within 3 days of my order. I didn't realize that<br />the books would be the small paperbacks, a particular issue for me because my eyes are bad<br />and the print is on the small side. More over, the box that holds the set got bashed on one of<br />the corners and I have to shove really hard to get the last book to fit into the box on that<br />side. Overall, I was really disappointed. I love the HBO series and was ready to embark on the<br />journey of reading the books. These are the small paperbacks.....not the large ones. I could<br />have gotten over the size of the books but the fact that the box came dented kind of added insult<br />to injury. I'm not sure if I'll return it yet. I hate it when retailers send products with defects.<br />It's a beautiful box, but the dent ruins it. The folks shipping the merchandise should have done<br />a better job of checking before they sent it. I hope the books are worth the grief.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent...as usual!  Well worth the read.  Connely has consistently produced good reads. The first one I read was Trunk Music and I've been hooked since then.
B00005QG9J|1.0|When I received the CD, the case was broken. The CD was scratched because it wasn't being supported by the case. This item was poorly packaged and I was very dissapointed.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Reacher never disappoints. Lives up to expectations. Descriptive repetitions that occur from book to book do not come in the way of a good read.
1603425381|5.0|This book has so many beautiful borders that it takes quite awhile to choose one but I totally love it.  I do a great deal of crocheting so it is fun to look for different borders to complete my projects.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a Great book. Couldn't stop reading. I actually read all 3 books within a couple of weeks :)
B0012GMW7A|2.0|Too dull.  Every song sounded the same.  I doubt I'll be purchasing anymore Leonard Cohen CD's.  The only song on the CD that had any merit was Hallelujah.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book doesn't read like most King books. I had doubts about picking it up for that reason.  It is very addicting. It is simply a must have book for the collection of any King fan. I give it five stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel would be great for the newlywed adult reader. Gillian Flynn's insight into the struggles of marriage during these difficult economic times, make this far-fetched thriller seem beyond believable. Her wit keeps you guessing at every turn, even when no surprises are forthcoming. Well-written and worth the purchase.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the old King James... but it is easy to read, easy to look things up, and it even reads it to you!!!  if you want!
1452110581|5.0|I bought this book because the cover was so adorable.  The inside is filled with more cat pictures, too.  The poems are funny and will sound familiar to any cat lover.  This would make a great gift for a cat person.  They are making a calendar for 2014.  I will be waiting for that one.
0375507256|5.0|The product was shipped quickly and got to me fast.  It is in perfectly new condition!  I haven't started reading yet, as I bought several books with Holiday gift cards, but am looking forward to it.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I downloaded CalenGoo for my Kindle Fire. I want to be able to have my Google Calendar with me whereever I am and since I take my Fire with me just about everywhere, it is nice to have my Calendar with me.<br /><br />The calendar works well with Google Calendar. It took me a little bit of time to figure out all that was necessary to be certain all my computers and devices were connecting properly, but once I got everything set up, I have found CalenGoo to work well on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I am happy with the product, though I think it is a bit expensive. I think it should be 2.99 not 5.99. Nevertheless, it is working well so far and performs exactly as I want and recommend the app.
0425263908|3.0|The condition is new and it was sent quickly.  Everyone who read 50 Shades recommended this book, but it almost seems so much like it that I can barely get into it.  Maybe once I read more I'll like it more, but at the beginning, I'm having a hard time getting into it.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Loved this movie. The actors and actresses did a wonderful job with the parts they played. You just love to hate the Queen and love Snow White. The twist on the Queen's brother also good. Can watch this one over again
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool it's like another version of temple run and jet joy ride ride. I like this game a lot it's better than temple run
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was very well written. It is able to pull you right there in the thick of the action as it takes place. You can almost  see thru the eyes of Mr. Owen. I'm sure that he will always carry the visions of things that occured, both before, during and after the mission that removed OBL. It really made the world a  safer place,for a time at least.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I had never heard of this game, but after a friend told me about it I decided to give it a try. Many levels and many opportunities for fun for all ages. I recommend the game to anyone who feels they need to keep their brain stimulated.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Excellent..fun to watch. Good chemistry. I encourage folks to buy this and other seasons.<br />Even startef buying Richard Castle booka
B0063IH60K|4.0|There are few better ways to quell being bored than a deck of cards and a game of solitaire. This game utilizes great graphics and is extremely intuitive. I recommend to anyone who enjoys playing the game. The price is right. :-)
B00006CXSS|5.0|I can't even tell you how much I enjoyed this. I am not a fan of war movies but this one had me in the first 15 minutes. We couldn't wait to get home at night so that we could watch the next episode. And it was exciting that one of the men in this story actually lives in our town. I met him a couple of times at different functions. Incredible man!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|A Great Read! Loved the books characters and enjoyed the way the plot kept me attention.Looking forward to the next Scarpetta book!
B002SRQ214|3.0|It came without any problems, the cpu its self was fine but the heatsink wouldn't reach the motherboard correctly and i had to loosen some screws to get in on but other than that very nice and worth the price.
B0086700CM|3.0|this game I love this game and i love it even more when my crush started to like it but it lags alot on my kindle fire and it is killing me u need to upgrade it and u need to do it ASAP...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not typically a gore fan, but my kids made me sit down and watch this... Now I can't wait for the second half of season 3 to start...  We had a Walking Dead movie marathon and couldn't stop. Great story line.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game is super awesome but the only problem I got is that it freezes alot please fix it.....my top score is 1654324 and I want to make it even higher
B000002OG5|5.0|I loved the movie (movies) and have wanted the sound track for a long time.  Now I have this CD and really like listening to it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the mocking Jay very much, or had a good ending.<br /><br />It was like it should be, life is not perfect.  It. Was mesmerizing<br />.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. It helps me relax no matter what mood I am in. I fall a sleep to most night's. I would recommend this to any one. It's so peaceful.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It is a really fun puzzle game. Probably the best I've played!!! I would recommend this to anyone that likes puzzles

B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS HARD TO PUT DOWN. IT HAS WAY MORE ACTION THAN THE FIRST BOOK. I READ IT IN LESS THAN TWO DAYS!
B003QSEKTU|5.0|it was very interesting and i loved all the singing i think it is a great influence on kids bye
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best book I have read in years. It's not as dirty as everyone says it is. It's like a romance novel. It makes me want a life like that. I also dream about the books like I'm in it.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|The Amazon summary reads:<br />For years, Grace has watched the wolves in the woods behind her house. One yellow-eyed wolf--her wolf--is a chilling presence she can't seem to live without. Meanwhile, Sam has lived two lives: In winter, the frozen woods, the protection of the pack, and the silent company of a fearless girl. In summer, a few precious months of being human . . . until the cold makes him shift back again.<br />Now, Grace meets a yellow-eyed boy whose familiarity takes her breath away. It's her wolf. It has to be. But as winter nears, Sam must fight to stay human--or risk losing himself, and Grace, forever.<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br />Although I don't usually read wolf/werewolf books, I decided to pick this one up because I had heard so much about Maggie Stiefvater's descriptive and emotional writing. I'm glad I did. It was a sweet story filled with wonderfully heartfelt poetry readings by Sam to Grace, the vivid imagery of the smells through a wolf's sense, and the \\"Aww factor\\" of how drawn they were to each other.<br /><br />I rated this a 3 star because while the main characters were fully fleshed out and so in love that it made you ache, the other characters in the book seemed like they were just in it for fill. To show that Grace has two best friends and she wasn't a total loner? Her parents were portrayed like this as well.<br /><br />However, the imagery in the book made up for the few deficiencies. I could picture myself in that harsh cold Minnesota Fall and Winter, and curled up with a warm blanket as I read. I will probably read the next two books in the trilogy to see if the mysteries about the wolf change are explained and where the relationship between Sam and Grace goes from here.<br /><br />For this and my other reviews, please visit me at: [...]
0765325950|4.0|Someone will probably lose their job over this release. Harriet Jordan is going to pass the buck once she see's the fan outrage. The publisher will pass it back and in the end this series will leave a bad taste in the mouth of the fans. The reviews of the actual content of this book are very high. It makes you wonder why they felt the need to grub for money with the hardback. Oh well. Maybe they will release the ebook earlier if enough people gripe about it.<br /><br />EDIT 02/08/2014<br /><br />I originally set my review to one start due to absolutely horrendous release of this that by and large made it unavailable to the e-reader community.<br /><br />That said, I have read the book and I have to say that enjoyed most of it. This started out as an amazing book series and a billion braid-tugs later we have an ending. Was it the best ending? No. But it does bring this series to a close. Sanderson is an fantastic author and it almost feels like he is held back by trying to force the story in Jordan's ending. I wont give anything away. But if you still have not read this book, and have read the other 13 by all means you have to read it.<br /><br />If you are considering reading this series for the first time, then be prepared for about 7 Great books and 4 Good ones and 3 Duds. This one is a good one.
0062127241|3.0|I would of prefered more of Pete's experiences with The Who and Rock experiences in general. This is Pete's claim to fame. Less about his boats, childhood, financial situation, relatives, child pornography etc. etc. It tends to be flat and drags.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This novel is, refreshingly, of sufficient length that it felt like there was time to develop and &#34;exploit&#34; the intertwining story lines (rather than what is more commonly seen today as short novels just to push something out twice a year to maintain an author's &#34;series&#34;.) Also, while still a collaboration, the writing seemed very much like the classic Clancy novels with lots of military and internet techno-detail to add realism without detracting from the action happening at the moment. That is something sorely missed.  This story is jammed packed with a lot of the characters that we've come to love -yet in still credible roles as they move into their 50's and 60's.  Developing Jack Ryan Jr as the replacement for his Dad and John Clark progresses further in this novel.<br /><br />Some might think this might not rate 5 stars but I gave it that because this improvement over the Clancy novels of late is something I'd like to encourage more of in the future...  this return to the original Clancy style and storytelling.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I'm not a gamer, so sitting on my phone playing Angry Birds is not a regular thing for me.  I downloaded this for my nieces and nephew.  They play this when they have the opportunity and they always enjoy it.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Growing up with 2000 AD & Judge Dredd as my weekly comic obsession I shudder whenever they talk about a movie after the Stallone version! This was Punisher: War Zone compared to The Punisher.<br /><br />Good move, enjoyed it enough to watch again sometime.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a very handy little tool for your knives. I carry mine on my keyring, though it's pretty large with all the keys I carry. The two V-notch sharpeners do a creditable job of straightening and even fine-sharpening a not-too-damaged cutting edge, while the diamond stick does good work on circular-cut serrations common on knives these days. It could also be used for a sharpening rod on staight cutting edges, after which you'd finish with the notch sharpeners. Overall, a pretty good little tool and not much bigger than it has to be.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Have it both on my phone and kindle fire, helps me plan my day and dress accordingly. Love the long range forecast.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Love this action movie. Thor is awesome and sexy! Plenty of action,humor and great special effects.Great movie for anyone to watch.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very informative app for my Samsung tablet. I use it all the time to check my battery usage.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|An assortment of Marvel Comics heroes fighting the forces of evil. This is a great action film and very enjoyable.
B00023B1LC|5.0|thanks good job x<br />xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xxx xxx xxx xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxx xxx
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Another Michael Bey hit. This Transformers wows with great special effects and great action. he autobots really rock in this one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is magnificent.  You really think about life and what's going on around you while reading this book.  It's a must read!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It gets the weather, which is really all I want it to do.  I'm not thrilled that it runs all the time, and takes over the dropdown menu screen (I don't know what that menu is called - a downswipe from the top of the screen, where the rotation lock and brightness settings are).<br /><br />I used the Gemini app manager to turn off some of the weather channel's features (making it not auto-run on every action I do to the kindle), and that improved it a little.<br /><br />If it had a setting where it only checked the weather when I actually ran the app, that would be preferable.
B002U5HKZ6|2.0|Long long long and long.  Way too long.  The story could have been summed up just as well in 300-400 pages.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I haven't been on youversion's website, though I did sign up for an account.  I also haven't used their reading plans.<br /><br />But, as a straight bible app, it is quick to jump to different verses, and different translations.  I like the professional recordings (as opposed to just straight text-to-speech).<br /><br />I have nothing to complain about this app.
B004QX07G4|2.0|While reading this book I felt like I was talking to Ellen at a coffee shop.  It's over 200 pages of her thoughts and they are random!  But I was laughing throughout and rethought some of the things she mentions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fascinated by the movie, I was inspired to read the books and loved the series. I also love how the movie followed the first book so closely. Can't wait for the next film.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|This is the second book in my life i haven't finished.  I tried and tried but just didn't get hooked and eventually had to move on.
0525478817|5.0|(NO SPOILERS) This book is the most perfect book I have read in a long time. I don't think I have cried that hard since Snape confessed his undying love for Lily Evans. So lets get to why I love it so much. Many, many reviews on Amazon are saying that this book has too complex of dialog for teenagers, but in the end, wouldn't you rather have a good descriptive dialog rather than the boring rather than the  repetitive language of the actual teenager. I just said rather so many times, but it makes me quite irritated that anyone would want the descriptive words to make one of a teenager.<br />(SPOILERS THAT MIGHT GIVE AWAY SOMETHING BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT THE SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK) It has been a week since I have finished this book, and I still keep thinking about it. Every single day I think about the love between Hazel and Augustus Waters, and how Hazel  must have felt at different points of time. This book review is kind of all over the place but, I wish that at the end of the book (after the email from Van Houtons assistant) I wish that I could have figured out what happened to Hazel after reading the thinks Augustus said to Van. I feel the same need to know what happened to Hazel, as Hazel did for the Dutch Tulip Man.<br />All in all this book is in my top five books. If you are struggling to decide whether or not to get this book, get it. It will change the way you look at your own life, and not many books can do that successfully.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I fell in love with this CD. If presented with a Live CD or a studio CD, I will chose to listen to a live format. They are just so much more energetic. This is one CD that I can't get enough of, so much so that I can't make up my mind which song I like most. There is one that prefer least of all, but that is not to say that it is bad, just not as great as the rest. That is Caravan, although I like this Caravan over the Live version of it on Time Machine [[ASIN:B005D0RDIE Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland]]. The live version just didn't catch geddy's bass like the studio version did. I am sure it was played the same, but the mix (what is up with the live mixes on Rush DVDs anyway?) was just lacking it.<br /><br />Anyway, if you haven't picked up your copy of this yet, give this one a try. I think you will be happy with it.
B007D5DUBG|5.0|Just happened to come across this group a few weeks ago and I am glad that I did! Great sound recorded or live.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|had a problem with a air bubble in between the two front covers in making a warranty claim lifeproof told me based on the serial numbers it was forgery. this seller should be banned from amazon or does amazon condone this as long as they get their fees
B003WH765U|5.0|This is one of my top favorite movies of Marlon Brando.  He was so smooth, jazzy, sexy and laid-back.  He went all out for the woman he met and loved.  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Red Buttons in the 80's and told him how much I loved his role.<br />He told me, not because he won the academy award for his role but it was his favorite movie also.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love this app. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. It looks just like my calendar on the fridge! I do not need it to sync to any other calendars. I can use different colors for each person in the family and easily see who has something happening each day. The only thing I wish it had were more visible lines per day on the month calendar. It only shows three. If there are more than three things it just puts a number in the corner so you know to expand the day and see the rest. I'm having a great time updating my &#34;mobile&#34; fridge calendar! :-)
140053271X|5.0|It is a birthday gift for my daughter.  She likes it and thinks that it will be very useful.<br />So,
0670026603|5.0|An uncommonly wise, poignant book by a writer who has taken the risk of writing--and writing superbly well--a book that not a few people may pass up if they read only the dust jacket summary. Don't make that mistake. Read it.
B0012GMWCU|4.0|excellent studio showcase of some of Dixon's signature works.  Great backing band.  Informative, entertaining, and a great addition to any collection
B004INNRFK|5.0|David Foster completely gets it.  Excellent music here...Varied artists and musical tastes.  Awesome.  I own it and bought as a gift for somebody.  Right up their alley, they loved it.
B008602KQI|3.0|I am not sure how I feel about this movie.  I like it and don't all at the same time.  If you have read the books and have an active imagination, I think you may be left wanting more from this movie- like me.  It was a good movie but they left out parts that I think may be important and the actual hunger games seemed to go by too fast.  It was almost like they weren't in the arena for very long at all...making it seem less intense than the book.  Also, I feel like they were too easy on Haymitch.  His character in the movie was much more muted than in the book (He seemed to be too functional of a drunk at the beginning....not falling over, no throwing up...)  Like I said, not a bad movie but definitely left me wanting a little more from the movie.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This novel is entertaining, complex and very well written. The characters are believable and very well developed. I look forward to the next novel in the series (trilogy?) and will buy it as soon as it becomes available.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It really is a must read, I haven't read the whole series at the time but I can already sense why this is considered by some a classic of the sci fi genre
B008YU0AOE|4.0|I luv calculator pro because of how it works. this calculator  doesn't rip you off with just the +-&times;&divide;. when you turn it it gives you other options for something in math you want. even though it is having some problems on my kindle fire I can deal with it.
B009H442DG|5.0|i really liked listening to the cd over the holidays. i thing that the story behind making the cd added to the pleasure of listening to it
B000EZ7ZYA|5.0|were very excited to get this DVD! We are big fans of Kevin James and Will Smith! Were Very Happy with this purchase it was shipped in a timely manner and were very happy with buying this product from these guys!! We would buy from this user again!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|reallly great to use when going to a retaurant or a poorly lit place to be able to read something
B008F5Y7UQ|4.0|Typical relationship story of boy & girl with a happy ending and a few 'bits of wisdom' from the royal highness. The camera work was very good and since I purchased this will be watching again with the wife - kinda of a feel good movie guys, the gals will dig it, especially since there's two guys going 'nutty' over the same girl.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was like a magnet for me I could not put it down the story made u laugh cry and hold on to the edge of ur seat! Would love to see a sequel!!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Wonderful! Takes me back to Peggy L:ee days. Guitarist was awesome..<br />I first heard her on Colbert, he always has great musical guests.
B008X8QCTO|3.0|I love Alawar games...that being said, I found this game a bit disappointing. Yes,the graphics are great,story line was entertaining and the game length perfect,however,paying  an extra fee in order to finish the game is a mistake that I hope Alawar will not make again. I'd rather the charge of $1.99 up front. I had to tap on objects quite a few times before they would be recognized,sometimes having to use a hint. Some of the puzzles froze, I waited for the skip button to move on. Other than the issues I stated, I did enjoy the game. Played on KF hd. No problems with download.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I enjoy this book, it held my interest till the end.  A must for the avid reader.  This writer has made a fan.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I saw a production of a High-School Concert version in 2009 and became attached to the music.  I had not seen a production of Les Miserables up till then.  I own the 10th Anniversary CDs and have seen the DVD of that concert.  Now I've seen the movie and the 25th Anniversary concert within the last month, what a treat.  We have also seen 3 movies made of the book, our favorite one is the one made in 1930's.  Forgiveness, redemption, giving ... all relevant topics in the 21st century.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is by far the best one in here for the kindle fire. I love tge buttons are big and it makes it look like i have a huge ass calculator in hand. Its just simply awesome :D
B004DM0UII|4.0|This is probably the best quality streaming radio app I have tried so far. The variety is enormous. The only major drawback I found is this app drains my phone battery down twice as fast as other radio apps like I heart or Pandora. That won't be an issue if you can plug in, but don't expect long battery life if you can't plug in. Four stars due to heavy battery drain<br /> If the can fix the heavy drain issue I will make my rating 5 stars.
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|Incredibly useful gadget for playing loud guitar quietly! My wife loves it! Also great for playing along to backing tracks or original songs through the input jack.
0446580848|2.0|I started with Plum Island... loved John Corey... read all the DeMill Books.  This story is long and drawn out and the wise cracks are forced and limp.<br /><br />I have liked DeMille because he tells a great story.  Unlike some authors he does not hurry the ending as he approaches the 300 page mark.  He lets the story dictate the length.<br /><br />In this case, probably 300 pages would have been about right.  More action was needed.<br />It was a tough read with not much reward.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not up to Grisham's early works. Easy to put down. Even too farfetched a plot for the most avid Grisham fan.
B000002ULO|5.0|Aside from &#34;All Things Must Pass,&#34; this is the finest post-Beatles album.  It sounds like &#34;Paul Wilbury&#34; thanks to Geoff Lynn's great production.  &#34;The World Tonight,&#34; &#34;Young Boy&#34; and &#34;Calico Skies&#34; are among Paul's best work.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer capture the unforgiving nature of combat and the seemingly randomness of combat.  Mistakes in combat almost always result in death or serious injury.  During my 30-year Army career as a field artilleryman including a combat tour in Vietnam as a lieutenant, I often reflected on the randomness of combat and why one soldier would be hit and another unscathed.<br />A popular saying while I was in the Army was \\"A plan only survives until first contact with the enemy.\\"  \\"No Easy Day\\" demonstrates that while SEALs do detailed planning before each operation, they are more than capable of adapting and overcoming changes in the situation.  The book underscores the sacrificial love military personnel have for each other.  \\"No Easy Day\\" emphasizes the importance of tough, totally realistic training and discipline to success during combat operations.<br />While the defense attaché in New Delhi, I worked with members of Delta Force and JSOC (but no SEALS) during a prolonged hostage situation in Kashmir in 1995.  I also knew several SEALs who had left active duty and were working with for another government agency.  All of these outstanding young Americans were world-class athletes, generally quiet, reflective, and totally committed to mission accomplishment.<br />Some folks have raised an outcry over Mark revealing operational secrets.  Quite frankly, while I understand security and secrecy, I did not read anything in the book that was not available in open sources.<br />In some respects, \\"No Easy Day\\" and SEAL Team 6 remind me of the quote by George Orwell: \\"Good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\\"  I salute Mark and the members of SEAL Team 6 for keeping our nation safe.
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|You better get it just right because they won't stand by their products. They sent it to my wife as a Christmas present and they sent it to the wrong kinde. To this day I have written them 10 times trying to get my money back on the original order but they don't even answer me, I had to buy it twice and they don't care
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Quintessential Evanescence. I am a big fan and this album does not disappoint.  Also would be a good first purchase if you are a first time listener..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a book that you wanted to keep reading and not put down. Christian had been through a lot as a child and it was amazing how Ana changed him to believe in himself.

0525478817|3.0|Who would have thought that one could write about teenagers with terminal cancer and make it entertaining and witty.  This author got it spot on.  It was very well written in a lighthearted way that made it a very entertaining read.  I did shed a tear at the beginning of chapter 21, and I defy anyone not to, but overall it was not a depressing book, despite the subject matter.  The three main characters, Hazel, Augustus and Isaac were just trying to live their lives as best they could despite their awful diagnoses.  They made me realise that people with cancer are still people as well and should not be defined by their cancer.  I am guilty of avoiding the elephant in the room when I see a child that has cancer and trying to avoid them rather than have to face the issue or them as a person.  I hope that reading this book will change that.<br /><br />I have dropped a star from the book as the character of Peter Van Houten was very annoying.  I realise that he was supposed to be a *** and very annoying but I felt the author went slightly overboard on getting that point across.  It was apparent early on and he did not need to labour the fact with some of the pretentiousness that was included.  It got so much at one point that I felt that the author was trying to get across how clever he, himself was rather than the character of Van Houten.<br /><br />I also dropped another star as I thought the ending was not tragic enough.  Difficult to explain why without giving away a spoiler but I really wanted it to end the way the fictional book (mentioned throughout) \\"An<br />Imperial Affliction\\" ended!  I thought that would have been a more dramatic and poignant ending.<br /><br />Despite only getting 3 stars from me, it was a good read and one I will definitely pass onto someone.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|I was totally taken by the story and each of the characters. It was amazing how the story revolved around one woman but each character was complete and extraordinarily important to the story!
B002SKZBQS|4.0|I prefer the science fiction King writes but I found this book enjoyable.  Set in the 70s but reflects today.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|very good  story line lots of mini cooper action wahlberg at his best charlize theron beautiful as ever a must see
B006GH6IWU|5.0|Fantastic look into the history of Queen,,,  Very well presented and thoroughly entertaining. Could watch it over and over again
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had no expectations about the novel when I began, as I avoided the review details and went with the star rating only. I am grateful that I did, as the unfolding plot was a shock to me and helped to explain Holder's previous actions and behaviour in the story. The characters were all beautifully written and believable, Holder especially.<br />The subject matter is painful, but it provides an amazing insight. After reading Hopeless, I feel an understanding and sympathy for anyone who has been impacted by such behaviour, both directly affected and those who feel the guilt of not being able to prevent it.<br />Hopeless at its core is a gentle romance about trust, patience and forgiveness, however I really feel that it provides important life-lessons for dealing with adversity of all kinds. I certainly feel like a better person for having read this novel. It will be a hard one to beat in 2013!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|great movie. no problems. definetly glad to add this one to the collection. it's already being passed around the family.
B0059XTU22|4.0|I stumbled into a near empty theater and collapsed into a seat. I put my 3D glasses on. The speakers hung above my head like war trumpets slipped into a familiar tune, and I was once again in Peter Jackson's Shire. Then 5 minutes rolls by. Then another 15. Pretty soon 30 minutes vanishes and Dildo Baggins and his merry band of ass pirates have yet to leave his crib. What's with all the character development when we have already seen it done this way before? Finally the movie takes off, and Dildo is well on his way to Brokeback Mountain... err... The Lonely Mountain this time. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey should really be called an \\"Expected Journey\\" because it's pretty much a repeat of The Fellowship of the Ring. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are some welcome surprises involving colorful residents of Middle Earth absent from the LOTR trilogy. Thorin Oakenshield does a half-decent job of filling Aragorn's void. Gollum is given a far better treatment in this installment through a very clever riddle exchange. The actor who plays young Bilbo is no Elijah Wood. Was slightly better than expected given all the negative rotten tomato reviews.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I already use FB via my mobile or desk PC, but it is handy to to be able to use facebook via my Kindle.
B004132HZS|5.0|I love this Sherlock, as I wrote about season two as well. I'm not a fan of use of technology in films, especially when updating Victorian classics, but I feel they've done that wonderfully here. I enjoyed the updated versions of old storylines. Cumberbatch is great as Sherlock! I also really like this Watson.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I just read a little at t time, the language from that time period and the fact it was originally written in French (I believe), makes it a little difficult to follow sometimes, but I am getting the hang of it.  Thank for the free download.
0307951529|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and also gave copies as a gift to family members who are working on the possibility of starting their own business. It's easy to read, accessible, and offers useful tools. I think it's a good place to start in order to work through how to start a business without getting bogged down or discouraged by more traditional ideas like business plans, etc. and yet face the important questions that need to answered in order to start a viable business.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|thought my grandson would like it, but it had pop ups asking to purchase options, too easy to spend money, I deleted it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I am not easily won over by new Sherlocks, but this version is very successful. LOVE Cumberbatch in the role. I am also often suspicious of the reliance on modern tech in stories but their use here in an originally Victorian story is done superbly here. I look forward to new episodes.
B0025KW29U|5.0|All of the original Blog - which comes to about 40 minutes - plus a load of extras & fan videos - top item!<br />(Watch out for various Whedon siblings, friends, colleagues and cronies in the background).
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Took me awhile to get interested,but once I did I couldn't put it down.<br />Definitely worth the money spent on this book.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Every episode (of course) in Blu-Ray Hi Def - apparently the original SFX were rendered for normal SD TV, so this is as sharp as they'll ever get.  Loads of extras, outtakes, interviews - top item!
B00935KWWO|5.0|I use  this app on my phone...I recommend this app to anyone, since I as recommend to use it. I like it better than the actual twitter app.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I can always count on Connelly to set Harry Bosch into an intriguing plot that keeps me interested right to the end.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Yep...love this player. Works great! Amazon is the best. I can find anything I ever need and love seeing reviews
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love angry birds and I have all of the others apps with angry birds and I like this one the best
1861085257|5.0|This book is full of ideas and tutorials. Has tons of great ideas and excellent pictures which is a great help when you're making the food!
B00845MRKE|5.0|This video collection was a Christmas gift and the person receiving this video was very excited to watch it right away.
0140544518|5.0|My Grand daughter brought the book home from school and read it to us. We laughed  until we cried, then she cried when she asked could we keep it and we had to say no. But Amazon has yet to let us down. My grand daughter is happy, we're happy and her book is in her bedroom.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Always readable are Patricia Cornwall books but this Bone Bed did not hold my attention as others have.  Still an intriguing read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. I didn't know what to expect with an alarm clock on my Kindle. I lost my Iphone so I needed a replacement alarm clock. I will definitely use it more! :)
B0006N2EZ0|3.0|I gave this as a gift and I wasn't given any negative feedback so I assume it was at least OK.
0316069434|5.0|Another Bosch series masterpiece.  Chop Chop Michael, I need more I don't think I can wait another year for the next one.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|The whole kit and kaboodle of this set is outstanding.  Darkness is my favorite album and the songs on the Promise are outstanding.  What a guy who can write and record all those terrific songs and decide they just weren't good enough for the record at the time.  Worth every penny.  And the notebook too, fascinating.
1582406723|5.0|Engaging story that provokes conversation and imagination.  BOTTOM LINE - Intriguing stories not meant for prudes due to language and violence.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|I've been listening to Neil Young for years and this is a nice collection.  My one complaint is that the collection seems to focus on a lot of Neil's &#34;hard rock&#34; compositions while somewhat ignoring many of his other hits.  Nice renditions of Cowgirl in the Sand, Southern Man, Ohio, and a few other but a number of songs that aren't my favorites.  I don't suggest this unless you really want to hear a fair amount of fuzz and hard rock.  The guitar work, of course, is excellent if you can get past the negatives.
B0084P9202|4.0|love Sigur Ros was in much anticipation of this album and pleased with the results.  Plus love all the videos ppl submitted
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have read many millitary books over the years and this one is in my top 5 books. I read seal of honour straight after FEARLESS however was really dissapointed as it was just snippets of information put together to make a book. FEARLESS is a great journey and keeps you wanting more. Amazing life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than book 1! Can't wait to read the 3rd one.  I'll be sad when it's over, sign of a good series.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Watch it if you haven't. Buy it if you have. Show it to your kids once they get old enough.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Being a life long Zep fan, I loved every minute and felt very emotional and overwhelmed while watching Celebration Day. This was so much better than I expected!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My daughter love this book. She's really into these because there funny and she can talk about it with her friends Boys n girls.
0765325950|5.0|When i started this book i was worried about SO many things. Would everything be wrapped up? Would i like the ending? Would i feel it unfinished and demand more? So so many things. Well i now have my answer.<br /><br />The book is long at 908 pages and it is FULL of WoT goodness. Near as i can tell every little plot line or thread was resolved in one fashion or another. There may be one or two that COULD have had something happen, but anything that MATTERED even a little in the overall story got some attention. One of the few downsides to the book is the number of characters we see. Almost eevryone gets SOME page time, the effect that this has is you may not get your favorites as much as you would like.<br /><br />There is alot of serious things in this book compared to the others, its the last battle what do you expect. Though serious there are those little bits of humor spread throughout the book that keeps things from being downright depressing, reflecting, in a way, the struggle of the light and shadow in the book. As it progresses it just gets darker.<br /><br />I sit here just having finished the book and honestly cannot think of something that i flat out hated. At the end considering everything that brought us to the ending and the ending itself i can say that i am satisfied. Of course i want more, maybe a little short story or something but i dont NEED it. We have reached the end of an epic and it is one that i will visit again in the future.
B005LAII80|4.0|This review doesn't reflect upon Amazon.com or the movie in particular, but rather the actual product; in this case, Dredd on 3D Blu-Ray/Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I purchased my copy elsewhere, but my Blu-Ray player didn't read the disc. There is only one disc in the box as this disc utilizes new technology combining 3D and standard Blu-Ray on one disc.<br /><br />I promptly returned it and the customer service rep also tried to play the disc, but met the same results. As I was at the counter, another customer saw that I was returning a Dredd Blu-Ray and mentioned that his player wasn't reading his copy of Dredd either.<br /><br />Maybe we bought from a bad batch, but just be aware that your player may have problems reading this Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray version of Dredd. I just wished they came out with a Blu-Ray only version. Good luck!<br /><br />The movie by itself I thought was good enough to buy on Blu-Ray; not many flicks make the cut when having their DVD version replaced with a Blu-Ray copy.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|Seriously...talk about a kick a$$ movie, very good actors, good story and jam packed with kicks, punches, survival and real life for the 3rd time.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Kingsbridge a couple of hundred years later with new, interesting characters. It was a fun and worthwhile read. I found the characters a bit more subtle this time out. In the previous book it was very clear who was evil and who was good. This time no main character starts out evil, they all grow into their roles.<br /><br />The story has the twists and turns of the first that will have you pounding the table in frustration and wondering if it is actually going to work out. The characters felt alive and authentic if not a bit before their time (only one or two).
B000QFQE4U|5.0|Gotta love brand new items for a great price. A very good movie for anybody who appreciates history as I do.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved this book and the way it tied all the others in the series into it. The twists near the end made it hard to put down.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a great story! Characters were believable, and it just flowed good.  Really enjoyed this little book!!!! If you want a good read during a calm weekend this should definitely be your choice.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|5 stars because I didn't need to link this calendar to any of my email addresses!!<br />It does not send you annoying reminders either.<br />Nice app.
B001HN6940|5.0|It was a gift. Delivered in a timely manor and very much enjoyed by the recipient. I will use this same method to get movies in the future.
B007712XAU|4.0|I'd heard the clamor, the accolades but hadn't watched it: so why bother now?  A friend recommended it and loaned me her copy of DA-Season 1.  I'm not much for soaps, but I got into it and fell in love w/it.  Recommended.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Not your usual story but a delightful one.<br />Interesting twist on the way the story was told - loved the boook!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Review of Band of Brothers<br />This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he is thoroughly enjoying it.  He really enjoys that he can rewind an area that he did not hear or wants to see again!

0792844890|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over, my kind of humor. Very funny, clean and all around a fun time.
B007V65R54|5.0|Mr. Silver makes accessible and enjoyable what could easily be a dry and boring subject.  He illustrates his points using real world topics such as baseball, politics and the weather.  I doubt I'll ever look at a weather forecast or an election prediction the same.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is great, perfect for people of all ages,kids to adults. glad I got this game and will play this in my down time
1402760663|5.0|Amazing addition to my collection of history - All people should know the history of our ansestors, our elders no matter what race you consider your self
B005LAJ212|5.0|Revenge is one of my wife's favorite shows. She just had to have the complete season to watch again whenever she wanted to. I'm sure this will be shown as reruns in the future, but being able to watch it in the correct order as the episodes were shown is much better than having the reruns jump around.
0060987464|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Marilyn Manson, so this was a must-have for me.  It is super interesting, and never boring.  It gives you real insight into his mind and his beginnings.  Really gives you something to think about.  A great read.
037582913X|5.0|Three yr old grandchildren loved this. Had to read it over and over! Was loved by their father when he was little. I like the larger format and sturdier pages.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I loved the first movie, and I love this one too!  I know it got some bad reviews, and there are some nay-sayers out there, but this movie is great.  I watch it over and over again!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was perfect after reading Thoughtless and Effortless. Travis was the perfect &#34;bad boy&#34; and his character displayed that. I was happy with the ending, but was disappointed it was over. I wanted to hear more of their story.
B002APU580|5.0|This adaptation moves right along and has an excellent cast - beautiful cinematography. I've watched it several times already. I took a chance and bought the DVD without having viewed the film first - it was a good choice. Enjoy!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Enjoyed this story.  Love the way Mary won over all with her wit and humor. Love does triumph over all.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I'm hooked, we play it all the time on our kindle fire.  My 4 year old grands love to play it as well and do pretty well.

B004HX4RT6|3.0|Nothing special but more than adequate. Fills the empty moments on occasion along with a bunch of others that I rate the same.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book was addicting for me. even though it featured so many saddeningmoments the romantic vibe made it more than a sad story of peoples struggles. amazing book and i recommend it to everyone!
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Nothing special but more than adequate. Fills the empty moments on occasion along with a bunch of others that I rate the same.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child really hit the big time on this one.  Really kept you going with all the story lines.

B0015DROBO|3.0|Slow beginning, interesting body and satisfying conclusion. Now I can see the movie. I am looking forward to reading the next book. I wouldn't mind going to Sweden either.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game play it all the time. Only one problem when you turn out of coins you have to wait awhile to get more coins but very fun. Hint if you run out of coins go to prizes and sell any prizes you have that will give you about six to sixteen coins depending on the prize.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it to organize my recipes, menus and shopping lists in one notebook. In another I keep patterns and photos of creative projects. I can see that this app will quickly become indespensible as I find additional uses.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I wasn't prepared to actually like these books, but I absolutely LOVE them!! Yes there is a lot of sex in them but if you look apart from that and look at the story, it's really good. It's very different from everything I've ever read, and it's the best $30 I've spent in a long time!!
B005LAII3A|1.0|Another year, another unnecessary remake rolling down the Hollywood assembly line. Fortunately, most filmgoers knew &#34;Total Recall&#34; (2012) was a stink bomb and stayed away in droves. Colin Farrell's humorless performance makes you long for the days of Arnold Schwarzenegger. A memo to producers with money to burn: Think before you green-light.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it has one problem. I got the kindle tablet edition and every time I got off it wouldn't save! it is a good app ....besides that 1 thing.For your info. same thing as Temple Run.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|this is one of the first movies we got for our child to watch at home. there are a few &#34;scary&#34; scenes: the mean dogs on the street, and the mean rat in the baby's nursery. Being mindful of those parts of the film, your child (and you) will love to see the Darlings and their new puppy Lady ... meet the dogs in the 'hood ... see the baby ... the naughty cats ... adventures with Tramp ... and the famous spaghetti kiss scene.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Have been enjoying this long wonderful tale, a very creative and paints a remarkable kingdom full of surprises!  I haven't made it to the end yet but hope this saga continues!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|the music, the characters, the lines, the dvd extras! our family has seen a lot of disney, but this movie is at the top of the heap.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Fun app cause two of my. favorite things. are combined. Space And of course ANGRY BIRDS must get I tell u
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Very easy to use and effective.  My only issue is that if the battery is low, it sometimes keeps coming back to the battery page instead of staying on my book even during charging.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|This is a fun game with awesome gameplay, it's incredibly satisfying to fight in the arenas and leveling up is quick and you can upgrade while in matches instead of having to slave through match after match to improve. However, while the game is fun, the interface of the game is slow and laggy and multiplayer is virtually nonexistent because the servers are absent of any players, so it limits the game to solo play, which is fun in itself, but not what it could be.
B0055SJVPW|5.0|On time in a very good shape and looking like new. I was expecting my dvd the following week and it git home three days after the purchase... love it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the book I couldn't put it down.  I read it in few days.  I can't wait for the third on to come out.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm very happy with this movie it was here before they said it would be so Christmas was great thanks
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Enjoy the fact that when I go out shopping I can figure out the percentages and decide if I want to buy. The large numbers display is helpful to my mom with vision impairment
B001IHJ97E|5.0|I enjoyed this film. A good fantasy that made me think. What would it be like if we could record not just memories, but physical feelings? Of course it also could be dangerous as seen in this movie. But to be able to experience a roller coaster ride, or a car race without actually doing it would be pretty neat I think. But I wouldn't want to know what a heart attack felt like as also seen. I think the special effects were good for the time period in which it was released. I looked this film up and read about where it almost was not finished. Not due to the death of Natalie Wood, as her main scenes were done, but the studio had issues. Interesting too that the director said he did not want to do another Hollywood film, due to in my words, drama. I had seen most of this movie before, but it was nice to watch it from start to finish. To me, this is what entertainment should be. Great idea, and very nice fantasy. At the end of the closing credits it says, For Natalie. I am glad to have this one in my collection. RIP Ms. Wood, you are certainly missed...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It helps me relax and keep my mind sharp.  It design is colorful and the different setting is great. Music is good as well
B0000AMJED|5.0|no scratches :) Love the product. will order again in the near future. Thanks so very very much!!!!! :)  :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is my new guilty pleasure.  I recently starting watching this series upon the recommendation of a friend and I'm so glad that I did!  If you are looking for a new drama in which to immerse yourself, this is the one! Always entertaining, well written, incredible wardrobes and scenery, impeccable acting......If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!
819073914X|5.0|Bought this for a grandaughter in high school.  Read it myself decades ago.  See, you folks are not just into Justin Bieber and Hunger Games!!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app and it is definetly a lot better than bloons tower defense 4 and it has great graphics.

B0014VQGX4|2.0|\\"Santa\\" brought this toy backhoe to my 2 year old son (who thinks he's 5 or 6) and it was an instant favorite, he wouldn't even let it go to open his other gifts.  It seemed like a great toy and he loved it, unfortunately, by the next morning he had already broken it in two places, so now the arm and small bucket no longer work, the bucket is hanging on by a thread.  It has a very poor and weak design at that point and is bound to break with any use of the toy in sand, snow or dirt which is abundantly clear after it breaking with minimal use on anything \\"work\\" like that these trucks would normally encounter with little boys playing with them.  He is still begging us to fix it (it is not fixable) and tries to play with it, but has very limited use now.  Very disappointed in the durability of this toy, especially with the cost of it, it is made for little boys and should be far more rugged then it is.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This film disturbed me more than any film I've seen.  It has stayed with me more than any film I've ever seen.  It's the only film I regret watching (though only partially) because of how it made me feel.  I think I've even heard that the director regrets making it.<br /><br />Knowing as little as possible is important here.  As such, I'll focus on what it is in a broad sense and not what it consists of. I'm going to write in short sentences to avoid revealing anything about the story.<br /><br />Martyrs is a character-driven story and deeply personal.  Violence is not especially prevalent, but when they do use violence it is for a specific purpose and it happens to characters you will likely care about.  The tone is absolute despair and it evoked a great amount of empathy from me.  The directing style is very intimate and professional.  The cinematography is beautiful: stark, clean, and perfectly suited.  The set design is unique and the talent used in creating these locations greatly contributes to the film's ability to linger in my mind.<br /><br />I'll never watch it again but it was a hell of an experience, both in cinematic presentation and because it was thought provoking. In analyzing how I reacted I feel like I've had a chance to kind of look into my own personality.
B00915G6WQ|2.0|After Showtime's major blunder with the spoilers in the season 6 DVD (read reviews if you haven't heard about this), i would recommend finding an alternative to the DVDs to season 7.  It makes bad business sense to embed a commercial in a product that Dexter fans have just paid for with hard-earned cash.  And when that commercial contains a spoiler, well, just read the reviews...<br /><br />Purely on principle, you should find this content through a streaming service or alternative source on the internet.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Seiko quality. Killer price.<br /><br />Looks great and feels very solid. Self-winding easily exceeds manu's estimation of how long watch will keep time without wearing (winding). Easy to set, as well....no instructions necessary.<br /><br />The glass case is pure buttercream on the Seiko cake.<br /><br />Maybe I need one in blue? Maybe I need a black one, also? I like green...
B005FISBTO|1.0|As other reviewers have noted, each DVD in this set begins with a commercial that you cannot avoid (e.g., by skipping to menu or fast-forwarding).  Believe me, countless reviewers have tried, and there is no way to skip the commercial.  Worst of all, the commercial contains a major spoiler about season 6 of Dexter.  In this day and age, it is easy to find any film or TV show for free online -- so why penalize paying customers by making them watch a commercial?  And not just once -- the commercial is on every disc and will play every time you insert the DVD. (The whole concept of commercials is that they fund free entertainment such as network TV. In this case, you pay for the entertainment and then get to listen to Showtime beg for your subscription dollar.)  Plus, including a spoiler in the commercial borders on PR-suicide. Bottom line: find this content elsewhere. Do not buy these DVDs.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Its awesome, fun my son loves it its a blast exiting to play itand nerve recking and its just one of the best free games
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow - what an amazing book. The story of Sky and Holder is amazing. Deep and meaniful.<br />Very good story, would be great if she did a carry on of this book to see how Sky and Holder carry on with their lives.<br />I couldnt put my kindle down - i had to finish the book first. It really was an awesome book.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This game is really dumb in my opinion and NOT addictive at all...which is probably a good thing :)  I wish I knew how to delete apps from my Kindle Fire because this is one I would delete.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|My daughter loved this movie and shared it with her kindergarten class..... over 20 years ago!  I bought this copy for HER daughter and it is still magical, mystical and beautiful. The music is amazing and &#34;The Snowman&#34; captures the attention of not only the children in the room, but also the adults.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love DeMille's writing and his great character development.  I sometimes find myself laughing out loud at John Corey's sarcastic humor.  A great read and I highly recommend it.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|fun game but hard to win very much.  It is to far fetched for most of the shots that you have to choose from
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I love that the case is no bulky like the outer box but I hate that it was extremely hard to use the function keys like the volume buttons, ring/vibrate button and the power key. I also didn't like the didn't lay flat.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Only gave it 4 stars because I know he is capable of so much more.  Getting a little tired of hearing &#34;Home&#34; so much, but I guess that's the sign of success.  Look forward to hearing more from this talented guy.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|THis boook was very moving. A wonderful portrait of a relationship between a mother and son. A intricate picture of a mental health facility.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't tear myself away! Can't wait to read the rest. I love the way the author keeps the reader on their toes.
B007P6VM04|5.0|An excellent TV series with excellent music sung by excellent singers.  Loved every track and can't wait for the next series.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This doesn't get old or boring like some tv shows that have been going for awhile. I can't wait for season 6
B005O64VH8|5.0|If you are a fan of Secret Garden, this disc will add to your enjoyment of their music.  I never tire of their sound.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|my son ordered this book and had it read in a weekend, he is 12 so I guess that proves it was a great book!!
B005P4P966|5.0|Great season, just wish the digital version included the special features. Asides that, if you are a bbt fan, this is a no brainer!
1439196834|5.0|probably will not help you pick up chicks but it is really funny and interesting, very quick and easy to read
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You go on a whirlwind of emotions with Eva, her trying  to find her way and fight her demons as well as fight Gideon's for him.
143911000X|5.0|Quick and easy read, very funny and is quite interesting, guys should really buy this and read it, BRO CODE
B00004D2YN|3.0|Our DVD player would not play this DVD saying it had an error and that it couldn't play because it had an inbedded region code.  However, we were able to play it in our laptop.  Disappointed in inconvenience.
0765325950|3.0|I read the first book in 1990, and I have been loyal to the series for more than 20 years.  This book did not feel like it was authentic WOT, but we have come to expect WOT light since at least book 7 anyway.  I found the pace that was set to be galloping and intense, but the connection that we usually have to our main characters just was not there.  They were not as developed as they had been in other books.  I suppose I should rejoice that at least we got to see them all in this book.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in the lack of developed character - particularly of the Foresaken.  Yeah, they are supposed to be hundreds of years old, and they are supposed to be the best of the evil - smart, capable, and cunning, and yet they were not.  They were bunglers and one dimensional.  I was talking to another WOT fan today -- can anyone explain Moridin's presence in the series to me at all?  His presence in this last book was particularly confusing.  I was left dissatisfied with the rush to finish them all off, and in anti climatic or only half developed ways.<br /><br />Where was Alivia and her part in the prophecy?  After all the foreshadowing of her involvement in the Last Battle, she isn't ever there.<br /><br />Book 12 had given me a resurgence of energy and hope for the series, but that energy and detail was not carried through in 13 or this book.  I am so thankful that the story was able to be finished, and that I know what happens to my beloved characters, it just was not the developed story and characters that I had wanted to see.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Writing was light, vivid, and very English. Wish it had more substance and action other than just a man reflecting on his wrecked life. Some parts I just couldn't relate to. Ending was rather depressing. It was a decent read but left much to be desired.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is an adult movie with adult humor and leans more towards being a guy movie.  We thought it was very funny.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I'm not a Trekkie. I didn't like this movie. The action scenes are ridiculously boring and anti-climactic. No motives are really explianed for the villain, and some of the scenes drag on soooooooo long. (I hope you can tell how slowly by how many 'o's I used there.)<br /><br />That being said, I did take one thing from this movie: If Tom Hardy and Patrick Stewart ever decide to just make a movie where they have intense discussions about things of an important nature, I would be so down for that. THe only interesting scenes in this movie were the ones between these too discussing whether or not they really were each other, and what that meant for the other, and their destinies. Yes, that's correct - the only good part of this movie was the heavy dialogue scenes.<br /><br />And the visual effects. Whoever edited the movie slowed it all down too much, but they are still pretty.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazingly well told. It keeps you turning page after page. Each new twist has you gasping and wanting to know why. You get so wrapped up in their lives, you can't help but think you are there with them...experiencing their lives as your own. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed reading so much!
B004SIP8OI|5.0|I am of the school, when it comes to Tarantino, the Pulp fiction was overrated. Not bad, just overrated. So when I get asked what my favorite Tarantino film is, I say Kill Bill, then specify part one. Stylistic, well-acted, and candy-coated in blood and violence, this story goes between real life and cartoon, back and forth through time, and opens up a long, winding plot that grows thicker with each question answered. I'm not an Uma fan, but she pulls off the calm, angry, badass chick with a katana in a way that is rarely done well in movies, and manages to get some convincing emotion out here and there.<br />Great music, great dialogue, and a fantastic story with empathetic characters kinda leaves you wishing it was longer than the total story's four and a half hour runtime.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I do home daycare and love the fact it is not a video game they actually build it and want to play it all the time!
B004SIP8SY|4.0|Its got some fantastic fight scenes, another amazing soundtrack, and answers all the questions posed in part one as the bride cuts-things-in-half her way through the last two members of her old gang to get to bill the boss. THe story is waylayed several times by flashbacks, but the story being told form behind is engaging and interesting - Pai Mei is a great character, and almost inspired my brother to grow his eyebrows and beard out just to try and mimic the awesomeness that is his fumanchu style.<br /><br />My only beef with this movie is that it builds dramatically, constantly bouncing back and forth between Bill, the Bride, and their past, but when the final fight finally comes, and they spend a dreamy few hours as an almost normal family, it leaves me wanting. I was dissapointed with Tarantino's choice to make the ending anticlimactic and sharply simple. It didn't fit the rest of the movie.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|My grandson absolutely loved this set. It was his favorite and kept thanking me for purchasing it! Played constantly with it for the entire week they were here!
B001FB55Y4|5.0|But still very much his. Stylish, really, really funny, and well-acted, this is your standard British gangster type movie, where there is an old guy who is trying to screw over the younger generation of criminals, but due to some coincedence and a missing painting, the tables get turned on him.<br /><br />It didn't have quite as impressive set of plot twists I've come to expect from Ritchie, but he compensates by wonderful characters and lots of very clever dialogue. Gereard Butler, Idris Elba, and Ton Hardy all play believeable but not over-the-top small time criminals. (Idris Elba makes me laugh at every scene he's in.)<br /><br />Also including Mark Strong as Archie, the second-hand to the old guy boss and middle man between Larry and the other srooks, is eloquent and funny, but also darkly ominous. There's a lot to enjoy in this film. It's pretty easy to watch, and most of the cast is really fun to watch as their stories eventually meet up at the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game app. timekiller for sure. there is a bit of a lag on the touch screen sensitivity and the games I played were very basic but still pretty decent.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|The best way to begin this review is by stating the overall feeling I got from this movie. In the hands of any less an actor than Tom Hardy, and with any less perfomance form his supporting cast, this movie probably wouldn't have been very good at all. But fortunately, every person rises magnificently to the task of filling the story with its offbeat, sleazy, and sometimes criminally dangerous characters, and turns this from a self-indulgent gore porn to something fascinating, a trip into a broken from birth mind.<br /><br />Bronson is insane, haughty, and completely in love with himself. And while this isn't a new concept in movies for an antagonist, the strange wonder of this film is that Bronson is our protagonist (anti-hero, whatever you want to call him). But the kicker is that when you delve into his mind the way this film does, you realize two things: first, that there is no deep-seeded reason why he acts the way he does outside of making a name for himself and the sheer jollies he gets from it, and two, you don't really hate him for it. In fact, you feel like all the character wants is for you to hear his story and know it, and not going beyond that makes you able to make a lot of decisions on your own.<br /><br />The pacing is good, the story told linearly, but its bizarre. In a good way, of course, but very very bizarre and violent, and darkly comedic. Bronson is a complex character who seems unreal, but still gets grounded in his own humanity form time to time, especially as he ages.<br /><br />This movie is a must-see for Tom Hardy fans, but is not for the feint of heart. If you do watch it, be preparred for lots of violence, lots of really foul (to the point that it makes you laugh then feel bad about laughing), and LOTS of seeing Tom Hardy naked. Lots of it.<br /><br />All in all, if you can take the brutal nature of this film, give it a shot. Not for everyone, but it was definently a movie for me.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I think he's getting better at these sagas.  The characters are real, the story is riveting, and I am glued.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I paid $6.99 for just a few extra features that the free version doesn't have. If I'm paying $6.99 for an app than give me more of what is on the PC version! I understand not everything on PC can be mobile but please add some more features PLEASE! The only reason I'm not getting rid of this app is because I can't get my money back.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|Waste of a dollar. Kindle Fire does not have GPS so program does not work. Program works great on Iphone.<br />Hey Amazon give me my dollar back!
B00447L4JG|5.0|Any Tim Burton fan would agree that this is the ONE to watch. I absolutely love this move and recommend it to anyone who has yet to see it. The art is horrifically romantic, and the story is beautiful. A masterpiece for sure and a absolutely lovely story for any age!
B005COO1X6|1.0|Not worthy of Stephen king. A very poor effort.  Not even worth 2.99 you get what you pay for.<br />Just junk
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Purchased for my husband and he Loved It!  Great old movie, 2nd disk is just as good.  Has actual footage of York and the history behind the movie.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Although it was different from what I was expecting, it really held my interest. The ending was a surprise, but yet it rang true.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rankin remains head and shoulders above other crime writers, with his frustratingly self-destructive Rebus being beautifully portrayed. You don't read Rebus books for American style unbelievable action, there are plenty of trash novels around for those so inclined. Rather Rankin describes a complex personality in Rebus that is totally fascinating.  I have read all of the Rebus books and I wish that there were more
B0050PYNOY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  There are so many great one-liners, a lot of which you might not catch the first time around.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent episode... loved it and am eager for the next episode as well... my favorite TV series! Keep 'em coming.
6305428352|5.0|this is an awesome movie.. i absolutly love it.. the ending will make you cry though... but so worth it...
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Couldn't wait to finish the last of the trilogy. Suprises till the end. This whole series was hard to lay down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is so much fun sorry temple run creaters but this app is a lot better than temple run I wasn't very good at temple run but after getting good at subway surfed I was a stud at temple run because its so much easier than subway surfer so if your looking for a challenging app that's a lot of fun buy this app its really fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|Oh my Goodness this one is totally my favorite! Keeps you on edge & keeps you trying for more coins & power ups & you can change characters. Love it is all I can say! It is a challenge!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't generally write reviews for books; I just read them and go on to the next one.  However, after reading this one, I felt the need to share.  This book grabs you from the beginning and simply does not let go.  The characters are developed well; the story line starts out good and then after several twists and turns, you realize that you are really hoping for a happy ending for the 2 main characters.  Without giving away too much, I'll say that although there are dark parts to this book, it is far and away one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  The characters will get into your head and make you care about them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game, Makes you think & rethink. It likes you to use all the spaces so sometimes you have to restart & go back to square one & start over to see the possibilities where you can use them all! It is neat!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it... Great for finding crafts, especially great knitting projects! I love the DIY projects too and Christmas was magical!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love it! Gets me to where I am going & that is what it is all about! I like to look at what is for sale or check on my stuff that is up for sale!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is the best series out right now!  I absolutely love it and would recommend  it to everyone I can't get enough!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This has to be my favorite cd. The music is wonderful and the entire cd is worth listening to. I only have a few favorites on their other cds so I skip songs but this one is a full play through!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|This is the ultimate feel-good movie!  Part drama, part comedy, part musical!  A must-have movie!  Who doesn't love the movie GREASE?

B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love this match 3 game.  Graphics are awesome.  Lots of items to put in the fish tanks to make them beautiful.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very fun and entertaining. Would recommend to all who like simple games.<br />Sometimes you just want some entertainment and do not want to be challenged to much.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, loved the cast.  This movie was exciting and very interesting. It had me on the edge of my seat!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I highly recommend this trilogy. I couldn't put it down. Collins transports you into another world, what a brilliant mind.
B004MKLRQA|5.0|When you feel like your life's really hard, there's not much to be happy about, feeling sorry for yourself, thinking that things can't get worse... read this book and you'll realize how much you have to be grateful for.  After closing the book for the last time, I'm left with the question-- what can I do to help? It's absolutely heartbreaking that human beings can be so heartless and cold, especially to innocent civilians who don't want to be involved in any violence. Something does need to be done, in Africa, in the Middle East, in South America, even in the United States there's much to be improved, but what can the average citizen do to help? I wish I knew the answer.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is honestly a great app, tells you how much time you have left to do something and opens up when you plug in the charger. And even though this doesn't as effect how the app functions, one of my favourite features is that you can change the colour of the battery.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I can`t stop playing this game. Really enjoying! Version 1 had more interesting spending earned tokens, this on just buying powers. Still good game. Thanks.
B0086700CM|1.0|Eh.  I' ve Played Better Games But This One I Thought Was FUN.  UNTIL IT GOT REALLY BORING.  This game is a waste of space
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is hardly left alone very long.  Very much a challenge and hard to beat.  Just keep coming back for more.
B007N85POS|2.0|Definitely Not As Good As The Other Rovio Games But Its Okay.  I Prefer Angry Birds Star Wars, but okay.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Saw her in concert with<br />Chris Botti in Greenville, SC.  Enjoy Renee music very much. Was not familiar with her previously.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Book is great. The Black Box is thrilling.  I loved the twists the turns and the whole story. I can't wait for Connelly's next Harry Bosch or Mickey Haller book.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Good kid's movie, especially if they are old enough to ask questions and have an active imagination, what? why? where? and what happened to?
B000IZA9PI|4.0|2002PG13: Once again, going against the grain on this one! One of the best Star Trek Next Generation flicks out there. My personal favorite next to the Borg & Rath of Kahn. You're gonna have to judge for yourself, but even if you don't think it's great you'll definitely enjoy. MFJLabs 4x
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Survival story that grabs you from the very first page...main character is funny as well as resourceful...look forward to reading more from this talented author.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author.  I enjoyed every part of it.  So much thought went in to how the story was told and it made for a great reading experience.  Different from other story tellers.  This style of revealing the story helped keep the ending fresh and surprising.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is addictive and will haunt you in your nightmares. . . . . . . . . .
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Chilling and a wonderful production in the audible version. I had never read the original Dracula and now I have. It was great. I may have to read it again.
B001H1UQRI|4.0|I loved the twist at the end. You have to pay attention to some of the details to figure it out. I waited a long time to watch this movie but it is definitely a must have.
0345803485|1.0|Thought it was going to be great, poorly written, poor character development, kept hoping it would get better. Wish I had just recycled.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|sometimes a bit challenging and to occupy your mind when waiting at your next appointment instead of last years mangled reading material
0345803507|1.0|Seriously, I was a deer in the headlights to read all three; kept hoping it would get better. It didn't - written at a fourth grade level.
B001U8ZSCG|4.0|Iconic music from an iconic time in American history. Not to mention, it makes for a hell of a sound track for one hell of a movie.
0345803493|1.0|Was thinking this one might be better; written at a fourth grade level, insulting really. Should have read reviews and not hype.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really a page turner. Shocking twist and turns. Nothing you expect from just reading the title. Haven't read a book like this.
0765325950|5.0|\\"Memory of Light\\" is a great finale to a great series.  I loved the way it was all woven together from the first book to the last.<br /><br />As soon as I received my copy, I started reading.  I sped through the book the first time but now I am starting over reading slowly so I cannot miss any of the resolutions or see how the foreshadowing in previous books work out. I can tell the difference between the writing of Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan in that Brandon moves events along although I felt like I was often just getting snapshots here and there in several places where I would like to have had more dialogue and more resolution. Robert wrote in such detail that helped me to feel the atmosphere of this world, the emotions and what they all were experiencing.<br /><br />I am sorry to say goodbye to these friends I have followed for years.<br />\\"Memory of Light\\" is a conclusion to a series that I have enjoyed.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Great sleeve for my 10 year old. Lightweight and easy to locate. Protects the Kindle and gives him a place to keep it when not in use.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I'm trying to go to my friends zoo but it says we don't have the same versions of this game please make an update or something I really want to see his zoo I mean reserve so answer answer answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ps great game and if you do make an update.put more animals in it.and I will give you a 5 star review
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Great game.  Make more!  I can't stop playing this game.  I would like a never ending game like this one. Less searching and more hidden game though.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|My husband got me into Green Day years ago.  It took me awhile, but I found<br />that they have some great songs.  I really enjoy listening to them.
B002RKSZS0|3.0|Much ado about nothing.  Poor girl at the mercy of rich people and the main character seemed to be very weak.  I guess she was just young.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|Nice read. If read again, I will skip over the chapters talking about evolution and the speculation as to the how and why humans were born to run.
1449433251|5.0|This was the perfect collection of Calvin and Hobbes.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old son and he loves it. It is Softcover,  so it requires a bit of careful handling, but very nice overall and the case is a nice feature for storing the set.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Caution, if you don't trust your kids you better lock your settings! one of the key features is a shopping cart to add more to the game. I was looking for simple games for a mentally challenged adult who can't read. Luckily, I caught this before she went 'shopping' with real money!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I gave it a 4 star cause I thought it was that good.i would read more of her books,thank you
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like how this game is progressive so when you are feeling like a pro at one game, you are ready for the next one
B00846REIS|4.0|Loved it, loved the story and can not wait to read the next one. Had a 50 shades feel but not as \\"dirty\\". Loved the writing style
B009FZFONO|5.0|The characters continue to surprise.  Rick's breakdown when he first saw his(?) baby, didn't see his wife, knew she was dead but obviously couldn't say it so asked instead &#34;where is she&#34; and was then told of her death (I cried like a baby).  Shane's good and not so good sides obviously warring with each other (I marveled at how well he was able to keep himself under control for as long as he did).  Glenn's battle with the &#34;walker&#34; when he's tied/taped to the chair (I was terrified, holding my breath, absolutely certain that Glenn was done).<br /><br />And Daryl...  I love Norman Reedus (Boondock Saints anyone?) which is why I started watching this show.  Who would have known that Daryl has the side that he does, the &#34;softer&#34; side.  Holding, rocking, and feeding that baby, grinning the whole time?  And then when he thinks he's lost Carol it's so evident there in the prison hallway how hurt and angry he is about it.  Then he throws open that door thinking it's more &#34;walkers&#34; and he finds Carol alive but terribly weak and he carries her back to the others.  It is very touching to see that side of him.<br /><br />Those are the characters that are standing out in my mind right now.<br /><br />This show is incredibly addictive (I hear they're planning a marathon here in the next month or so, this is one marathon that anyone watching will stayed glued to their seats for).<br /><br />I find myself watching episode after episode on VOD, and Netflix, and Amazon (the cliff hangers make it impossible not to keep watching), and suddenly it's 5 in the morning, I'm exhausted and falling asleep and still I want to keep watching.  I know of no other TV show that has ever done that for me (but &#34;Falling Skies&#34; and &#34;Revolution&#34; are close).<br /><br />[I'm a late comer to the show so I'm trying to get through all of the episodes (Season 1 thru 3) before the rest of season 3 starts here soon]<br /><br />And I add my voice to the public outcry of &#34;DON'T KILL DARYL&#34;.  There are a few characters that really are integral and to kill them off would really change the dynamic, and probably not in a good way.  Can anyone imagine that group without Daryl?<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. :)ry of &#34;DON'T KILL DARYL&#34;.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I love this book. It is a page turner and has you dying to find out the ending. I also love how it is told from different perspectives. You can identify with the characters and that always is a plus.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Oh Yum!<br /><br />Ladies, the two lead characters - Connor and Murphy MacManus played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus - are drop-dead gorgeous, irreverent, funny, have an excellent - and typical - relationship, and everything else positive.<br /><br />Guys (and gals like me who enjoy it) there is plenty of gun &#34;play&#34;, a lot of action.<br /><br />It's said they didn't know each other before the first movie.  You'll find it very hard to believe when you see the camaraderie between these guys.<br /><br />Some like I better than II and some like II better than I.  I love them both and I can't watch one without also watching the other.  My son will typically fall asleep before we're through both of them.<br /><br />There are a lot of little things in the first one (I haven't noticed too much in II yet) that were obviously crew mistakes but they're still fun to watch, especially when those little mistakes cause extra skin to show such as when Connor's position changes frequently when he's out cold in the alley.  VERY nice views there. ;)  That entire scene is such a blast (not just because of SPF's skin shots).  I'll rewind and watch it again because I love watching Connor jump down (I know, it's a stunt guy), watching Murphy (Norman Reedus) run around gathering everything while that excellent score is playing, and then hefting Connor up to carry him out of the alley.<br /><br />And I join the public outcry by begging for a 3rd, please.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Fabulous fantasy.  I love it.  I love when the weak become powerful and don't let the power corrupt them.  Vin is a wonderful heroine!  Sanderson is extrordinary.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very good writting, character development, and filming. Certain scenes are breath taking! The show can be enjoyed by both men and women (a rarety for a television drama).

0547848412|5.0|This was a well written book that I truly enjoyed reading.  One that I know I will enjoy again and again!
B009B8YZIK|5.0|My 9-year old son is all into HALO and wanted this movie for Christmas and loved it-said it was a little sad in the end
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I loved every page. Holder and Sky's characters really come to life in this book.  Definitely recommend. I couldn't put it down.
B002WCLG48|5.0|My 9-yr old son wanted Halo Forward unto Dawn for Christmas and you all had a special showing Halo Legends so I purchased both.  He was so surprised and loved them!  He said that there were a few sad parts in it-he has a soft heart.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is tragic and heart warming. Such a wonderful love story. I liked how it did not sugar coat the idea of illness.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Well directed, excellent attention to detail and engaging story. This is definitely a guy type movie and worth the money to purchase.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story went at a good pace and kept you guessing. I liked that it did not throw everything in your face at once.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Really good headphones. I did my research and these headphones are ace for listening to music and your mixes (the way they should be).<br /><br />Super comfortable after long use and built sturdy.<br /><br />Shipping was amazing. Arrived as expected. Highly recommended all!
1475143389|5.0|I read a lot about health and fitness and have been exercising on and off for a few years and I have to say that this book has changed a lot. After reading it, I completely overhauled my training routine and diet. Now, I feel that I will be able to stick to this and see some fantastic muscle gains. The book is well written and the information in it is easy to understand and remember. I definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to start a workout routine and even for someone who has been training for a while and considers themselves learned on the subject. I learned a lot from reading this book and I hope that other people do as well.
B0084IHVDO|5.0|Everybody wants to be a cat! I love Orignal Disney movies. Even though I'm a young adult now. I still have that kid in me.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the most significant events of recent history. This firsthand account provides amazing insight to a world most of us will never know. I congratulate and thank Mr. &#34;Owen &#34; for having the courage to not only wear the uniform but to endure the challenges of getting a book like this out to the general public. Highly recommend.
B000VUFJ3C|4.0|I hold the Backstreet Boys close to my heart. There music may not be as good as when I was a teenager. But I still love them. I got to go see them in concert when I was a teenager. I always remember a cousin of mine too who passed away sense I went to the concert with her also.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|love it cuz its just basic. like it cuz it fills screen. good for poor eye sight.to late in life for more than the basics

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|fun for kids amazing adorable a lot of fun  for older and younger to play and is excitingand and has cute pets.
B004478GNI|4.0|This was a gift and and seems to be as great as any other lego product. Directions are important and seems as though Lego should sell replacement pieces and leave direction on line in case you lose them
1419705849|5.0|i love this so much, along with all of the other books in this series! i love this series so much and i am so happy when a new book comes out because i dont like reading each one many times, but the only problem is that i always read every book in one day! i recommend this book especially to kids.<br /><br />Emma.H
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was intrigued by the talk, so watched the movie for a buck and had to read the books. Stayed up way too late many a nights. Even now 3 months after finishing all 3, I still have images from the book, enter my mind and contemplate. definately a better read than the movie. And as far a best selling trilogy of 2012 beats 50 Shades by a landslide. I think you need to know if you are assertive, get it done person or a passive wait and see person. I can relate to Katniss, do my own thing, I am my own person.Strong willed and determined! Anna was a passive wimp that would annoy me. I cannot be under someone else's control
B009POCG2C|5.0|Trouble With the Curve is a great movie. I’m a die hard Clint Eastwood fan and I love his no nonsense style. I have almost his whole collection except for a couple of his recent movies that he directed but didn’t act in them.
B002CYRROY|5.0|Excellent product! fast delivery, product match promised! I recommend for those who do not have space on the pc, however, it works much better as a hood!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|My English teacher once told me that the best books carry you along into the action, and by the end you feel exhausted. That is how this book made me feel. It was so good, I felt like I was there. Excellent book
0545265355|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Hunger Games trilogy. I'm currently reading them again and they are even better than the first time!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and easy to play. The only problem is that it can be quite a bit addictive!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It's. wan all right game. It does have some loading issues. And its a bit of a pain not to zero out your funds.
0345803485|3.0|Everyone I know - practically - was reading this book... except my Bookclub girlfriends...  So I grabbed a copy too.  It's OK, not exactly an intelligent literary accomplishment but it was amusing...
B0002W19KQ|2.0|I have seen around 5 film versions of one of my favorite novels of all time, but all of them comes about disappointing, and I really don't get it either, I really don't think it's that hard of a novel to film an entirely faithful version to the novel. But people may plead the novel's length being a handicap to film all the plot from the book into a movie, and they may have a point. However, with this long version with its total running time nearing 7 hours, starring the Meryl Streep of the French, there is almost zero excuse. I am not complaining at all about the things they've omitted (which are actually very few) but the things they could've stayed entirely faithful to the spirit of Hugo they changed into a lame act. For example, Jean Valjean telling Marius that he is actually in love with Cosette, thus causing Marius to banish him, can I just say WTF? The bishop in the beginning knew the Jean Valjean was going to steal the silver so he was testing him, which of course, stood entirely contrary to the character of the bishop in Hugo's words, that he is innocent like an angel smiling while spreading her wings and surrendering to the mysteries of the world and of God. Also Jean Valjean aggressively taking the money from Petit Gervais in the beginning while looking greedily at the money, when in fact at that point he doesn't know anymore why he is taking the money from the child. He is in that state in which we start doing things that we don't know why we are doing it, we just do them because we are in great turmoil, I'm sure everybody had those moments. Jean Valjean should've been played by a broody actor, and I feel that Depardieu is a serious miscast. The same goes for Malkovich as Javert, who is supposed to be someone whose \\"heart is made of wood\\" and doing everything by sticking to one principle. But Malkovich's Javert is just this annoyingly evil character who seems to get off of other people's sufferings. Hugo's Javert, on the other hand, is APATHETIC to other people's sufferings, he doesn't get off on them. I seriously think that David Boreanaz would've done a better job as Jean Valjean, even though he doesn't look or speak French. Honestly, if I was the writer or director of this mini-series I would've chosen much better actors (as in suiting for the role) and make a much more faithful script in Hugo's spirit. I mean, common people, what the heck is wrong with a blond Fantine?. Believe me, 7 hours is more than enough to make an entirely faithful Les Miserables on screen, but the producers of this film made all the bad decisions and wrong changes, which is greatly disappointing, I believe Hugo himself would've been puzzled.people's sufferings, he doesn't get off on them.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put down this book.  This world is so unreal and yet so much of it is very real and very current.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Missed this movie at the theater and wanted to see it. I saw it, and will never need to see it again.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Heart warming story. Makes you look at life from a different view.  I aways thought dogs were in touch with life.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was kept you guessing what was going to happen next.  You never knew who was allied with who.  I loved Katniss and Peeta and hope they end up together at the end of the last book.
0316226424|1.0|Not only this unoriginal book is pathetic, but its fans are as well. A few days ago i saw two fangirls fighting over the characters. I had never seen anything more stupid than fighting over book characters and defending their honor.<br />I hope that in a year or two these girls will finally understand that they are wasting their lives on an absolute trash. Yes, they will grow up, but sadly, a new generation of screaming, annoying fangirls will pick up the baton.<br /><br />p.s. Check out this book: http://www.amazon.com/The-Billion-Dollar-Girl-ebook/dp/B009K5DV6Q<br />One of the chapters mocks the twilight series, describing a love story between a zombie boy and a human girl who have very hot sex(!) and that chapter is extremely amusing.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Fun and challenging.  Runs great on my Fire.  There are hints in the game play if you look for them.
0525953728|5.0|I read the book in 3 days, it was hard to put down. It's a sad world that we have to live like this. I highly recommend this book.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Started a little slow but once into it, a good read.  A little disappointed in the ending but it's first of  3 so I'm looking forward to reading the next two with high hopes.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like this application, it's simple to use. I also like the blue and black set-up.  Give it a try, it's nice and basic.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Bought this one when it was 3.99.  Was pleasantly surprised, it has been in my ipod ever since and I have listened to it many times through. I especially love the first three songs.  Look forward to seeing more from this artist.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|This is a good app but it would benefit from a better instructional demo.  It is not real intuitive as to how to enter information into the calendar.  Many features and will recommend
B00A12VJZM|4.0|Let me start by saying I am just a casual Rolling Stones fan.  Picked this up for 6.99 on amazon.  I was pleased with it. I enjoyed the new songs on their album and it is a decent retrospective of their career for the casual fan.  Not sure I would recommend it for the hardcore stones fan though.
B008GAV6YA|5.0|Just the inspiration needed.  Thanks.........and especially like the heavy-duty, boy-proof pages.  Who knew a toddler would need a &#34;how to&#34; manual to learn to use the potty.  Whatever works say I.
0525953728|5.0|Another good book that I have recently read. When I picked this book up it was hard to put it down. I took my time and read this book in three days. Anyone that has worn the colors will appreciate reading this book.
B009O07NDY|5.0|We love the movie, the Hobbit, so my husband bought it for me. My kids even ask to listen to it!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Where The Killers moves away from their roots, Imagine Dragons picked it up and made it better. Great album for sure.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|When i first ordered this product, I was able to get it for the lower price, and that made actually have hope on amazon offering their own self-made products at a reduced cost. I believe I scored it for under 5 on prime and was very impressed when i received it. Now it has been my case of choice for awhile but its starting to wear by the charge port, as well as starting to rip. I understand that this is the next best protection up fro the bumper and it holds true to that. I was actually quite impressed on how well it fit and worked well on my 4s.<br /><br />I recommend the product, but after becoming interesting in picking up another one, I thought to myself that it was not worth the $10 price tag it has now. Considering how cheap they are to produce, I felt that Amazon had a little more hope on future purchases under the AmazonBasic name if it kept the price lower in hopes to supply a lower priced product of quality that will outshine any competition.
B0094OLFUW|2.0|If you need your XX fix, stick with the first album. The opening track gives this two stars as opposed to one.
B008NR8YTQ|3.0|Gary is one of my favorite guitarists.  This is not one of his better recordings.  Some things should be left alone. Jimi is one.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Title says it all. The acting is superb, and all the characters are sympathetic and likable... people you can root for, even when they are on opposing sides.  A touching tale embedded in a fantastical sci-fi background story.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Love Enya, Love this CD<br />Anyone who admires her singing will love this CD, especially the toy soldier song.  Recommended listening!
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books. I will def be re-reading them. They kept my attention at every turn! The excitement and adventure were so enticing that I couldn't put the book down. I read all three in a matter of 3 days!!!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My daughter loved this gift!  It was her favorite of all her presents.  I am giving it 4 stars because I wish the batteries were standard like AA or AAA, instead of the more expensive kind.
B00432QAKK|1.0|MWC is of course a 5 star show but you need to pay attention to which set you buy.<br /><br />There is the December 12, 2010 (ASIN: B00432QAKK) which Amazon offers for about $62.00 and there is the September 27, 2011 (ASIN: B005CGI4EG) which Amazon offers for about $32.00<br /><br />As has been noted by others they are exactly the same discs but the 2010 release has discs in individual cases and is a larger box set and the 2011 release is simply two stacks of DVDs in a box and they are not individually cased.<br /><br />The problem is when some sellers list the 2011 set with cheaper packaging as the 2010 set and it seems like you are getting a great deal.<br /><br />For example I just went through that exact problem with Discount Electronics & Games who lists the 2010 box set for only $49.95, this is of course actually the $32.00 but the seller still hasn't changed the listing after being informed.<br /><br />Also had quite a few problems with that seller (Discount Electronics & Games) trying to get it resolved and eventually had to file a claim against him to get refunded.<br /><br />So it would probably be a good idea to contact the seller before bidding to verify that they know the difference between the two sets and are selling the one you want. I wish I had done that the first time.<br /><br />Of course if you are looking for the cheaper set with the simpler packaging (discs are not individually cased) then that is no problem, just buy the $32 box set.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|I read a few of the negative reviews and I had to weigh in. This is a fun \\"no brainer\\" action flick. Basically \\"Escape from NY/LA\\" in space. Cool sets and both leads hold their own. It is nice to see Maggie Grace get to stretch a bit after 2 Taken movies. So pop up some corn and sit back and just enjoy the ride!
B007SGM084|5.0|Well, to me, it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be. It's decent literature and the only thing I disliked was the redundancy of the intimate moments. It was like \\"she's mad, they fight, they have awkward silence. Then make up sex, she loves him again\\" it happens at least 4 times in a row in the second book. Besides that I loved the series if you have time and just skip over some of the sex scenes then you'll enjoy it too.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This is like my favorite movie and Frida my favorite person.  Also Salma Hayek was wonderful in this movie.  Amazon delivered it like it was a new movie and it wasn't.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I enjoyed the film, but it isn't one I will probably ever watch again, and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone
0784010218|5.0|My husband loves this movie and was very happy with the condition of the movie even though it was not new.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great production with thought provoking progressive rhymes, what's not to love?  This is a great introduction to Macklemore, and is a must own for anyone who's into hip-hop
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i L-O-V-E THIS GAME!!! only one PROBLEM though. WHRRES MY UPDATE???  i play it on the ipod touch 5 and it has this really cool nyc theme and when i play it on my kindle fire its all ugly with the old theme. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!  (thankyou for your time) p.s I WANT THE BEW UPDATE NOW!!!!
B009MO57H6|4.0|Resident Evil Retribution is the fifth installment in this series.  The Umbrella Corp. has attacked the ship she was on and recovered her body for more research.  A rescue party has been chosen to free her from Umbrella clutches from an unknown element.  This takes on them on a journey of (cold war) ex-soviet cities from accross the world.  The same zombie are chasing them but have been educated to drive cars and shoot guns through a training program. The same predictable things happen but on a bigger scale and she was re-infected with T-virus.The battle at the end is pretty good and it leaves you an opening for a sixth movie and a daughter.
B004VF68AQ|5.0|The whole album is great!  I'm a die-hard Jane's fan and did not expect this to compare to their classics.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  Turn it up!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I purchased this when it first was released and then loaned it and never got it back.  This one happily replaces the lost one.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|L Cohen is the greatest songwriter of our time and this album (and tour) does not disappoint!  A beautiful marriage of melancholy, humor, and retrospect.
B004J64QSI|5.0|fabulous recording of a fabulous event! first saw this on pbs. now i will be able to enjoy it over and over.
1905236042|4.0|These cards were recommended to me by a colleague and I am enjoying them.  As a therapist I use these to help children explore relaxation techniques.  Works well in conjunction with TF-CBT.  Clients enjoy the varied exercises.  Nice pictures, good directions, and great poses.  I would prefer that traditional yoga pose names were used, that is the reason for only 4 stars, but it is no big deal, they're still useful, fun, and work well in the therapeutic setting.
1451695187|4.0|I've been researching NDE's and OOBE's for quite some time.  This book is extraordinary in it's import and implications, and that it happened at all, of course.  Personally, I've never had an NDE, but have had two out-of-bodies which served to remove the fear of death, although I freely admit that dying might not be that much fun ;-)  I got the sense that this book is a message in a bottle contrived by the other side with the Doctor as the agent of change.  I feel that the book was probably edited too heavily - the only way to really get the true feel for what was experienced is to get ahold of that first writing after the event - that 20 pages.  As it is, I felt there was more to tell.  It is a must read for those with any interest in life and death (who isn't?).  If the world has you stressed out, read this book - it can relieve many anxieties you may not realize you even have.  It is truly a gift wondrously given.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Very good story, but moved a little slowly in the middle.  Would have benefitted from a little more editing and wordiness.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Awesome great amazing fantastic incedible. Played all night I . Enjoyed alot it.. was. The greatest game ever played. Played till me eyes were tired. My whole family enjoyed it. I would rexommend it to anyone. If you like games this is the one for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Anyone that plays card games online will like this game. It will keep you entertained for many hours of the day.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Very  funny movie for the kids and for the adults in our house.  Has a pretty good story to it.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a laugh.
B005HSL626|5.0|Another game for your computer that will keep you entertained for many hours so get it and start enjoying it today.
0743270754|5.0|Got the book after seeing the movie &#34;Lincoln.&#34; The movie goes into much more detail in the events it covers. The book is well written and easy to read. It gives a real feel for the people and the times, bringing Lincoln to life. I found it immensely enjoyable and informative.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|How do you rate anything by Charles Dickens but very highly. So I would also recommend this book to anyone.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|My daughter and I made the garlic tart and it was amazing.  They are wonderful, healthful recipes and I will be making many more in the days to come.
B00632HWOG|5.0|How can you not like Yahoo mail. It is very easy to use and does everything I need in my email.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I usually get games on my Kindle Fire for my kids but this is entertaining enough for me too! It's fun to keep progressing to the next achievement without being monotonous, too easy or too difficult. I say get this one for sure!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love mahjong and besides that it is free so what do you have to lose. Try it and I sure you will like it too.
0061990477|5.0|Kept me out of mischief for quite a while.  I read it twice.<br />The characters are so true to life.  I felt I had a bunch of new friends.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and the price is exactly right for my budget. I would recommend getting this to anyone.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is my second swivel sweeper.  I flat wore the old one out.  I could not keep house and the price was so reasonable.  I would recommend this for anyone, especially if they, like me, have a light colored kitchen floor.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I don't usually play games but these bird games are very entertaining and I enjoy doing this in my spare time.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|First book on my new Kindle; great book with interesting characters;  I would recommend it.  I think it well worth the price.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I love this game and would recommend it to everyone that enjoys playing games on their computer so buy it.
0525478817|5.0|I read a review somewhere that said cancer was just the backdrop that fueled the love story. To that review I give a side-eye. This book discusses cancer alot. Cancer, cancer, cancer. Cancer here, there, and everywhere. And it's not the fairy tale cancer where at the end of the story everyone is cured and no scars remain. It's real cancer. But, true enough, the cancer made the love story that more touching.  I liked that the author didn't write the story in a way that seemed he was reaching for tears (even though I sobbed twice). I also loved how funny it was. It was actually really funny given the subject matter. I laughed a lot at the characters observations amidst the worst moments in their life. Hazel, Augustus and Isaac are quite the trio.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is one of my favorite games and have played it many times. It never gets old and will keep you entertained for awhile.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Love this!! Perfect picture. Clear and wonderful!!!<br />bought the cheapest one and have no complaints.<br />Great product. i recomend to all.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I haven't played this yet but if it is as good as the first one I played then I am sure it will be great.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a great read. The characters were believable and appealing. The storyline was good but very emotional. I was not aware that this book was going to be as sappy as it is. It is a chick book, even though it comes across more masculine in the overview. I totally enjoyed the book, just was not prepared for the emotional tug.
0765325950|4.0|I've been a fan since the inception - your refusal to include me in this release (as a Kindle reader) leaves me determined to NOT Purchase this book!!  I hope you feel the displeasure of a great many here-to-fore fans of this series.  You won't get my money - snub me I Boycott You.<br /><br />Good-Bye<br /><br />Finally read it - glad  it's over. No further complaints, thanks for a good 'tie up'.
B0053B347M|4.0|I have a 24&#34; monitor and have the light strip on the upper portion behind my monitor.<br />The Antec Bias Lighting Kit consists of one long adhesive strip of LED lights powered by USB. The strip emits a white light when turned on (there is an on-off switch).<br /><br />It provides a decent amount of light, though I wish there was a way to adjust the brightness for certain times of the day.<br />The adhesive strip is also not very strong and tends to fall off after a couple days. I currently use small strips of masking tape to keep it attached.<br /><br />For the price I paid, I am fairly satisfied with what I got. I would recommend keeping tape or your own adhesive handy when the built-in adhesive does not hold up.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is simply a fun movie - no social commentary or political message.<br /><br />The music and dancing are first rate.  The people cast for the various parts were right on.<br /><br />All those nice words from a 59 year old!
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I want to give it lower rating but refuse to waste any more time (ie: thinking, organizing and typing an extensive review) on this movie. The best part of this movie was reading some of the reviews on imdb. There are people that actually write: \\"I don't know why everyone is upset, the wolves are just being wolves...\\". Jesus, the wolves are just being wolves. In my entire outdoors life (over 40 years) I've seen wolves maybe 3-4 times & they ran off at any sudden movement or sound. Hollywood has to think the american population has gotten so stupid that they can feed us any amount of contrived BS & we'll accept it...
0316187216|3.0|I've read all of Abercrombie's previous books. If I hadn't, I would have enjoyed this book more. Don't get me wrong--it's well-written as all Abercrombie's stuff is. He's really good at juggling characters through all his books. It was nice to see some old characters resurrected (even though we don't hear much from their point of view; mostly from other characters observing them), and learn more about others (Zacharus.) My problem was with the Wild West backdrop. It doesn't seem to fit in the world Abercrombie created in his other books. There was too much of some plots (Temple), too little of others (the Dragon People), and the whole thing went on too long. Still a good book and worth a read, but not the best of Abercrombie.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I doubt there's much I can really say that hasn't already been said here. I resisted reading fifty shades for a long time. I've always read a little erotica, so the concept wasn't particularly shocking to me and I felt no great urge to jump in immediately. But eventually my curiosity got the better of me. I kind of wish it hadn't.<br /><br />It's just not a well told story on basically any level. The language plods and the characters are one dimensional. There's nothing wrong with a little over the top slightly unbelievable fantasy in erotica (hell, that's what most erotica is), but this took it to ridiculous levels.<br /><br />Not going to even try touching the sequels. I'd much rather re-read Bared to You if I want a dose of \\"impossibly perfect but flawed supergod\\".

B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is a very good comic. The illustrations are great, the writing is good. This is not about survivors going out and owning zombies, it's so much more than that. It explores the human psychology when put in difficult times and tough decisions. The only thing is that there are now a fare few comics that it's going to cost a lot to get all o  them. Just wish there was a bulk deal.

The only problem I had from the third party vender, that didn't have on \\"red letter/big letters\\" about coming from over seas, with that been said it didn't work at my house :( had to send it back.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We love this game!  It has two rules:  only connect corners of your pieces and don't go when it's not your turn.  It is so simple, but there are hundreds of strategies and anyone can win.  More complicated than checkers, less complicated than chess, but strategy is still the theme.
1451673442|5.0|I WAS VERY EXCITED AT FIRST TO COME ACROSS A BOOK THAT WOULD GUIDE ME THROUGH A PROCESS TO PUT INTO PRACTICE THE LAW OF ATTRACTION.I READ THE FIRST CHAPTER AND I COULDN'T TAKE IT. I WAS NO WHERE NEAR MY VORTEX NOR ALIGNED WITH MY HIGH VIBRATIONS IN ORDER TO FEEL GRATEFUL. SO...I PUT THE BOOK AWAY, AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF: WELL, I'LL WAIT UNTIL I FEEL MORE TUNED IN INTO GRATITUDE, WHICH I DID... I LET MYSELF GO SLOWLY INTO MY VORTEX AND, THEN, I STARTED READING AND PRACTICING THE EXERCISES. I CANT EVEN DESCRIBE THE WONDERS I'VE COME TO ENJOY... THE CREATION AND MANIFESTATION I HAVE DELIBERATELY BROUGHT TO MY LIFE EXPERIENCE HAVE BEEN AN EXACT MATCH TO THE GRATITUDE I HAVE BEEN FEELING. IT IS A PROCESS, AND YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO FEEL GOOD INMEDIATELY... YOU NEED TO LET GO THE RESISTANCE, AND WORK YOUR WAY TO A BETTER FEELING THOUGHT... AND LET ME TELL YOU, LIFE WILL SEEM TO BE MAGICAL. I THANK THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE I COULD ATTRACT THIS BOOK AND GET THE CHANGE I WAS TRYING YO MANIFEST. I RECOMMEND IT ONLY TO THOSE WHO TRULY WANT TO EXPERIENCE A SHIFT IN THEIR LIFE, AND ARE SERIOUS ABOUT CHANGING FOR THE BEST AND ALLOWING LAW OF ATTRACTION DO ITS WORK... AMAZING EXPERIENCES I'M HAVING, AND I HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED THE BOOK. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU...

B009APMNB0|2.0|There is nothing to Smile about with this very limited product. You get what you pay for. The Smile is easy to use but that's the best thing I can say about it.  The low price of the Smile makes it appealing but the results are disappointing. ColorMunki makes some sophisticated and more expensive products that have good reviews.  But the Smile is so basic that it does little to improve a monitor's color accuracy  that cannot be done more simply by paying attention to the monitors' own color and brightness settings. Save your money or spring for a true calibration tool. Or begin with a better monitor.

0446580848|1.0|I dragged through this book.  I usually like DeMille but this was truly awful..Zzzzzz.  It was not until the end that anything really happened and it is a tome of a book.

B005DC68NI|4.0|If you are looking to digitally self-publish, this book gives solid and straightforward advice into how and why to do so.    The author shows how the traditional publishing route is littered with roadblocks and how to get through them - not by driving around them per say, but by taking a completely different route.    He shows why the traditional publishing industry is crumbling and how any author can be just as successful doing it themselves as long as they have a good product that has been produced with the assistance of professionals (a list of which he provides in an appendix) and then marketed well. He also doesn't rule out the role of luck in the whole process.    I enjoyed the various cost/profit examples comparing the traditional and self-publishing routes and how many books one would have to sell with each in order to break even. This comparison alone should be enough to motivate any aspiring author to do it themselves - not to mention having full control over their work and acquiring various business skills that can be learned along the way.    After the author motivates you to self-publish he gives a straightforward roadmap of the steps needed to digitally create your eBook as well as sound \\"real world\\" advice on ways to promote it.    The book concludes with brief stories from 33 self-published authors who shared why they got into self-publishing and how they went about it. While I would have liked to see each author give their top 2-3 tips on what especially to do or to avoid in the process, some often just seemed to mention how many books they have sold or what they are going to sell. With that being said they all gave good motivation to self-publish. And with the previous knowledge learned in this book there should be no reason not to.    - Ed Frank, author of \\"How to Destroy Your Spiritual Life\\"  [...]

B002ZG993Q|2.0|Overall, it was visually pretty but 40min in I had NO empathy/interest in main character. Not good.<br />The story follows a professional hit-man when he's hired for a job by a young attractive woman.<br />If a movie wants to capture my attention, there has to be a really good story, even a decent story, or an average story.  I'm not looking for \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in every story.  I'm just looking for something that catches my interest.  This movie, did not do that.  In fact, the most interesting character was The Priest and he, unfortunately, was NOT the main character.<br />And it didn't bother me that he was a \\"hit-man\\", which would have been a personal taste issue with the story.  Okay, he's a hit-man.  Fine.  Now show me something about him that makes him interesting, that makes me be interested in his story.  There was nothing there.  He was like a dead character.  Where are his quirks?  His insecurities?  Where is the hint of his back story?  Where is his heart?  Maybe he's out for revenge?  But give me something, a REASON to want to watch the rest of the movie.<br />At 1 hour in, there was still no reason.<br />So, therefore the 2 star.<br />I'd recommend \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" or \\"Safe House\\".<br />Did I say it was pretty?
B00006J9OV|3.0|I decided to purchase this DVD because I was NOT familiar with Wagner's operas.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned there is not one single aria that stood out...how true!  There may be brilliant moments here and there in this opera ...but otherwise for ME, the music just wanders on and on.<br /><br />I am not qualified to comment on the performances of the singers - but in my opinion, they all did their best, and they all have WONDERFUL voices.  It was the opera, not the singers that I personally have difficulty with.<br /><br />I have made the decision that Verdi, Puccini, and Rossini operas are much better operas for ME, as I just prefer the style.<br /><br />I received a great suggestion from Esteban:<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Wagner operas, perhaps it might be best to start with one of his earlier operas such as Lohengrin.  And as you become more familiar with Wagner's style, you can always work up to his later operas.  What a great and very Logical suggestion !!

B0085RQLXK|5.0|This is the first review I have ever submitted to Amazon, and I have to say Aerosmith is kicking ass. I am through the first five songs and the CD is killer. When I previewed the album here on Amazon I had a mixed reaction, but since they are one of my favorite bands I decided to trust the quality they have always presented me as a fan and buy the CD. I love all of their music through to Get A Grip; after that it gets dicey (an opinion of course as I feel we will never get another Get Your Wings or Rocks) although I enjoyed Honkin On Bobo. For this band to put out this quality of music after four decades and all the perils they have been through is incredible. I love the band and with this album they have showed they can get together and produce great music decades later (so what if they are some ballads on the CD, they are still rocking out). Its so great that this is the original lineup still doing it! Awesome!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I honestly loved this book and can't wait to see the movie. Couldn't put it down. Very quick read and I definitely recommend it!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|When I first purchased this book, I thought it would be more like No Easy Day.  Boy was I wrong, and pleasantly surprised.  This is a great story about an all American boy who grew up to be a troubled young man, and then overcame his demons to become one of the Navy's most elite.  Everyone has flaws and Adam Brown's were worse than most, but once he overcame his drug addiction he pursued everything he wanted to do in life and achieved it.  It is truely amazing how much adversity this man overcame in his life, and this book does a great job covering it.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to others.
B0094K1MH2|2.0|I grew up with Tintin. I've read all the books so many times that I can't count them.<br /><br />Spielberg took so many liberties with the characters and the story that this movie does not make any sense for whoever knows Tintin books (and the TV series which I really like).<br /><br />He borrowed parts of multiple books and rewrote everything to try and make something coherent. To anybody who has any knowledge of Tintin, it's pure heresy! Things that you assumed happened in the past are now in the future, and vice-versa, etc, etc. Imagine taking The Hobbit and the 3 Lords of the Rings plus other books and mixing them together to form a new story without any consideration for the timeline, borrowing bits and pieces from each book and just making one single story.<br /><br />If you're not really into Tintin and want to learn more, I would rather advise to watch the TV series.<br /><br />If you really don't care - it's not a bad movie. It's well done and the intro is really cool.<br /><br />Me - I could not finish it - too much rewriting there...
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved this book! Seriously, read it in two nights.. couldn't put it down! The only downfall was that it is strikingly similar to Fifty Shades of Grey! However, I found this book to be completely more realistic
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|This isn't a bad movie overall I would say.  The expectations were high because of the two previous movies that are very highly regarded.<br /><br />I wouldn't say the plot and writing is the strong point for this movie.  The scientist who leads the investigation, Dr. Sander, is a cold fish who makes the transition from a stuffed shirt academic to a mad scientist too quickly.  He was crazy even before he became the Thing.  In fact it seems like everyone in this movie already saw part 2.<br /><br />The movie's greatest strengths would be the special effects for the creature and the scenery in general.  It also fills in some of the missing pieces about what happened before John Carpenter's version since this is actually a prequel for Carpenter's 1982 movie.<br /><br />Carpenter's version was not a sequel to the original but a retelling of the story to match the book 'Who Goes There ?'.  Carpenter's version is a classic but it introduced a lot of subtle and rather vague issues about the true nature of the creature which were not present with the original black and white movie from 1951.<br /><br />It's never totally clear to what extent someone is aware that they have been invaded by the Thing.  In some cases the person doesn't seem to realize it themselves until their head explodes while in other cases the person seems to be following the Thing's will at all times.  This implies that when the Thing replicates someone it can also replicate their memories.  This makes the creature basically impossible to identify for other people.<br /><br />In both movies confusing things happen which are really never totally explained.<br /><br />The Thing that John Carpenter created could never be allowed to get loose in society.  As Dr. Blair figured out in part 2 it would take approximately 27,000 hours or 3 years for the creature to take over the entire human population.  Carpenter's creature is sort of a hybrid between a demon and a virus.<br /><br />That factor creates a lot of restrictions for making a movie about this monster.  The group always has to be isolated from the rest of the world.  All three movies include a loss of communications with the outside world although in this installment the main scientist arrives from outside already knowing about the flying saucer.  To me this would imply that others outside of Antarctica may also have known.  That was a possible angle that wasn't followed up in this movie though.<br /><br />The ending of this movie doesn't make any sense to me if we assume that when two people are possessed by the Thing they would both be aware of this.<br /><br />There were three people involved with the final battle.  One was definitely a Thing.  But the Thing status of the other two was not clear to me.  The ending seems to imply that at least one of those two others was a Thing.  In that case why didn't one of them assist the other Thing to kill the normal person ?<br /><br />Either that or the lovely but lethal flame thrower wielding scientist made one heck of a mistake.  Maybe she got too trigger happy with the flame thrower I don't know.  She's another mystery in the movie since Carpenter's version doesn't say anything about her.  I guess we'll have to wait until part 4 to find out about her but at the current production rate for sequels that will probably be in 2041.<br /><br />Anyway something isn't adding up here for me.<br /><br />I hope the trend of showing parts of movies after the credits have started at the end stops soon.  Someone told me I missed an important part of the Green Lantern because I must have left the theater when the credits started.  I was probably out in the parking lot by the time they showed the part I missed.  Now I don't know what the Hell is going on.<br /><br />I have an idea.  What about producing a true sequel to the original 1951 version ?  Doing this would create a separate movie series from this one since the two creatures are completely different.<br /><br />Although I doubt that many movie producers would dare to attempt this unless they have a solid concept.  They would be messing around with a Hollywood legend.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0012DK4ZU Phantasm]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AQ6J4XM The Blob (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000YDOOHI Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (Color Special Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006OT40ZM Horror Hotel (City of the Dead)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000VIKPHE The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000AYYVBU The Manster]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003HIFVQ0 The Flesh Eaters]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003E1R5V4 Beyond the Darkness: Buio Omega (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003L9CB Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla / Godzilla vs. Destoroyah]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000JIJVKS Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction]]oubt that many movie producers would dare to attempt this unless they have a solid concept.

By sharing his story, hope has been given to those on the wrong path in life, and proof provided that it is a choice to become a person of great character.  Adam Brown is a hero! His wife, an example of true unconditional love and support.  His faith, an example of a rock solid foundation.

B0027MJU00|5.0|After reading 'Gone Girl', I read this one with high hopes and wasn't disappointed. As another reviewer stated, this is not for this  with a weak stomach. It's grotesque, suspenseful, and a great story. I will definitely finish up the other Gillian Flynn book after enjoying these two.
0765325950|5.0|Please ignore most of the 1-star reviews for this book as they are complaining about having to wait for the Kindle version. What a TERRIBLE way to treat the author.<br /><br />When I read Brandon Sanderson's first WoT novel I had faith that he would do the series justice. His books were the best the series had been since the first four or five novels. This last novel has proven my faith was well invested. It is the single best conclusion to any fantasy novel or series I have ever read. It was immensely gratifying and emotionally gripping. The pacing of the novel is unbelievable. It was as exciting and riveting as an action movie, but sustained for over 900 pages!<br /><br />If you are a lapsed fan, this book absolutely provides a conclusion worthy of the time investment. Suffer through the middle slog and earn your reward.

B000SVZIR6|5.0|Everything about this movie is amazing ... the cinematography, the acting, the plot, the costumes, setting, and the music. But the most powerful thing about this movie is that it shows what can happen when two truth seekers ... even from different cultures, races and belief systems ... respect each other and humble themselves to listen to and learn from each other. It also demonstrates the positive impact one person can make on entire group of people when he or she is willing to shine the light they have been given with others.  What makes it even more powerful is that it is based on fact. AMAZING MOVIE!  I watch year after year with my Logic students and the conversation it stimulates is always great. I highly recommend ANNA AND THE KING.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A friend talked me into reading this story, I still am not sure what all the hoopla is all about.  I`'ve read a lot better books, this one is different.
0784011710|5.0|One of the most beautiful, dramatic and tragic love stories ever told on film. The \\"Secret\\" that Sophie carried was the tragic \\"choice\\" that she and certainly other women of the era and place were forced to make. It is beautifully acted and produced. This film is a classic and tells the story of those Displaced Persons following World War II. It also shows the Nazi atrocities in a way that is both amazing and disturbing. Ms. Streep has earned Academy Awards, but her work in this film outshines anything she has ever or can ever do. One cannot watch this without shedding tears for both the triumphs and defeats of the human soul. I have seen this film more than once and never cease to be amazed and can never see it without tears for the story and times. IF IN YOUR LIFE YOU WOULD ONLY SEE TEN FILMS, THIS SHOULD BE ONE OF THEM.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The emotions are raw and I admire the author for sharing. How brave, to expose what most prefer to shutter. Also enticing; I dreamed of walking the pct many years ago. I'm inspired to start backpacking anew. I'm glad ms strayed was found.

However, even those who are not fans of the genre would enjoy it for the characters and the commentary on human nature. The author depicted the characters so the reader could empathize with their plight-even with those that were antagonists. It was not formulaic. I would think I had it all figured out and would be suprised time and again. Highly recommended!!
B0099114WO|5.0|Fun movie, great for empty nesters, tommy lee jones and Meryl Streep were wonderful together and do a believable job of portraying this middle aged couple.
B005EY2XFC|2.0|I like Alex Proyas-the director- very much and this one is one of my favorite movie.<br />I already had a DVD and when this Bluray came out, I decided to replace.<br />The result is a a disaster.<br />The image is not better then the DVD. Maybe even worse.<br />The sound is 5.1 HD but couldn't feel any difference. The base sound was so so. The channel was not divided well.<br />I really wish to have my money back.
0062200909|5.0|The package arrived in good shape,  This was the highlight of my grand daughters  Christmas gifts.  She is very much into  the  Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, and could not  put the book down. Thank goodness I decided to give that gift to her, after all others had been opened,  because after she saw The Hobbit of Unexpected Journey Chronicles, that was it. You could not have gotten her to open anything else.<br />  Thank you so much for sending me a reminder that this book was about to  go on sale.<br />You helped make her grand mother shine.!!!!!<br />I appreciate when  Amazon lets me know of upcoming items that they think I will be interested in.
B004L3AQLU|3.0|I am not saying I hated this film or it is a cheap erotic film.<br /><br />The acting, the story,.. everything seems decent.<br /><br />But Two actors' nudity seems too much sometimes.<br />I don't know why that was necesarry.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is a surprising actress in so many ways.<br /><br />In her level, she is popular and amazing enough to avoid nudity in her movies for success.<br /><br />Maybe, I thought, before becoming too old, she wanted to leave her beautiful moment through her movie-even though the story is not an erotic film (Clearly it's a serious story).<br />That's my honest thought about this movie.<br />Both actors are brave enough to show their whole body nudity.<br />The story is not perfect and sometimes I felt like I am lost what they are trying to say.<br /><br />The image seems perfect. It is HD image all right.<br />It is not an action movie or SF, so no need to talk aboout the sound.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is pretty good. If your looking for a good battle game, then this is it.<br />Also comes with online play
B005CMSDKA|5.0|This is the perfect example that when an artistic filmmaker meets a hollywood style movie, it becomes a really good result.<br />The editing, the great music-Chemical Brothers-, the camera, the story,... they all mixed together really nice.<br />It was like watching a slow music video somehow.<br />Also the acting was really good.<br />Blu ray transfer was superb.<br />The sound and image are all HD all right.<br />This film became one of my favorite even if it failed at the boxoffice in the US.
B000005JA8|1.0|Clearly these guys were working outside all limitations of musical style and format. But like classical composers who think all good tunes are cliche, if you refuse to make music then it's not music. Of course fans of this album are fine with that even though some would still refer to this album as a different kind of music. Shaking off the chains of convention is a declaration of freedom, just don't try to call it music. Music must be musical. If everything can be anything then nothing means anything.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy to download and would recommend book to all of my adult girlfriends.  Great read and very entertaining.  Couldn't put it Dow!
B000TGJ80I|5.0|The Underworld-unrated-blueray movie-is as described. The blueray version was better of course. I would recommend this product. This movie was thoughly enjoyed.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Easy to download and would recommend book to all of my adult friends.  Great read and very entertaining.  Couldn't put it down!
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|Does what is says saves a lot of time and effort great if you read a lot but don't have much money
B007SGM084|1.0|I found this book to be to erotic for me.  The sexual content was to detailed.  It left nothing to the imagination.  Not enough dialog.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Trying to move all the books I had on my Kindle (which I left on an airplane and never got back)  and I can't find out how to do it.  Have been trying to learn about this Kindle Fire since Christmas, it was a gift.  Have no luck understanding it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great brain teaser.  I have shared this app with multiple people.  Men, women, teens, and children enjoy it.  Even my 2 year old cannot get enough of it.  It is great for passing time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|great for killing time or entertaining kids. my 8 year old insisted on every faily member having on their phone so he can always py
B00622B3MY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for all ages.  It is amazing how the cars appear to live and act like humans.
1451662432|4.0|This Christmas present make really happy my wife's brother. We have seen many funny picture of Schwarzy and the first chapters that we read are interesting. I appreciate a lot this book.
0765325950|1.0|Read that Jordan's wife wanted to \\"protect his memory\\" and help ensure that book went to top of best seller list as the reason for the ebook delay. I would hope that one of Jordan's legacies would have been caring about his readers wishes more than some best seller list. The book is going to the best seller list in either case but delaying the ebook release is a bad decision. Wont be buying new at all. I will pick up used or library just to make sure that the poor decision to delay the ebook release does not increase the book sales for best seller list purposes. Terrible decision by Jordan's estate or the publisher.
0807014273|1.0|Out of falsehood nothing good can come.  Viktor Frankl devotes a large section of his story to Auschwitz, and claims to have been there for quite some time, noting that \\"we had to wear the same shirts for half a year, until they had lost all appearance of being shirts.\\"  In reality, Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz, en route from Theresienstadt to an outcamp of Dachau. As Timothy Pytell, a professor of history at Cooper Union who has researched Frankl observed, a reader of Man's Search for Meaning would \\"be stunned to discover that Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz\\" and \\"if truth be told, Frankl's rendition is contradictory and profoundly deceptive.\\"  Frankl finally admitted the truth in 1991 when he told the magazine \\"Possibilities\\" that \\"I was in Auschwitz only three or four days [...] I was sent to a barrack and we were all transported to a camp in Bavaria.\\"<br /><br />Frankl left Theresienstadt on October 19, 1944 and arrived at the Dachau sub-camp Kaufering III on October 25, 1944. How then did he come to write his stories of Auschwitz?  One cannot avoid concluding that he simply made the stories up.  One could also have determined this from Frankl's story of seeing large flames coming out of the Auschwitz crematorium chimneys - a technical impossibility for such installations.<br /><br />One can even identify Frankl's transport from Theresienstadt. But the Auschwitz Chronicle of Danuta Czech gives the following account of his train:<br /><br />\\"October 20: 1,500 Jewish men, women, and children are sent in an RSHA transport from the ghetto in Theresienstadt. After the selection, 169 women are admitted to the transit camp and 173 men as prisoners to the camp. The men receive Nos. B-13307-B-13479. The remaining 1,158 people are killed in the gas chamber of Crematorium III.\\"<br /><br />Frankl did not receive a number at Auschwitz.  According to Danuta Czech's reasoning, which is followed by all the standard histories of Auschwitz, this implies that he was gassed.  In reality, he merely stopped at Auschwitz on his way to Kaufering III.  Therefore Frankl's real story disproves the story of extermination camp Auschwitz!<br /><br />As for Frankl's philosophy, it amounts to a ponderous meditation on one of Nietzsche's epigrams.  Its fame is principally due to the intrigue of the Auschwitz story, which turns out to be fundamentally false.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really felt letdown by how this series ended.  I won't give anything away, but I felt like the series was ruined for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was so easy to purchase and download book and did not have to go anywhere to buy the book!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|great protection for the kindle and looks great too, it is  a perfect fit doesn't move around at all in it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Almost like Amityville except you can't talk to other players or buy clothes or stuff for the houses.you can build an army and battle other players in a minimal kind of way.I work graveyard shift and it makes timely by tho plus it's free!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Just what I need to free up storage space on my phone! Also works great for transferring pictures from phone to computer. (Pictures can be accessed from computer once uploaded)
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Action packed very interesting plot, kept my interest until the end. Enjoyed the movie. Look forward to the next one.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|I bought this for late new years eve celebrations (watched it after getting back from fireworks that night) and my friends and I absolutely loved it! The whole series is a lot of fun and this movie is at least as good as the others. The only bad thing for me was it had nicky minage in it. Ick.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is a wonderful, clean movie. A beautiful love story. Both of the main actors did a wonderful job portraying the story of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert coming together.
B009ZFPQOQ|3.0|This is not a bad app, but it chews up battery. I like how it helps avoid certain road hazards.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|My daughter LOVED that we got her all three DVDs in the Dark Knight series and it was a fantastic price.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD-- excellent story. :-D I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and I remember how much I watched it. :-D I'm grateful that it included subtitles because I'm Deaf.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Haven't finished reading it yet so I can't make any futher comments about it. Will tell more when finished. ?
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD-- excellent story. :-D I'm grateful that it included subtitles because I'm Deaf. I'm looking forward to watch this movie again over the summer when everything is settle down.
038533348X|5.0|As most Vonnegut writings, this book (one of his most famous along with Slaughterhouse Five), is a great story that makes you think about the possible destruction of the world and makes you think about life. Vonnegut is a genius
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD-- excellent story. :-D I'm grateful that it included subtitles because I'm Deaf. I'm looking forward to watch this movie again over the summer when everything is settle down.
0385333846|5.0|Along with my review of Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse makes you really think about life and the world. &#34;So it goes&#34;
6305313687|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD-- excellent story. :-D I've learned so much from this movie-- it made me realized with a lot of things in nowadays. I'm grateful that it included subtitles because I'm Deaf. I'm looking forward to watch this movie again over the summer when everything is settle down.
B0080R3TYO|2.0|Read this for a class. Felt it underplayed alot of the areas that helped in the development of societies. Diamond seems to think that only these factored in, which is not the truth.
B0086900TI|5.0|The shipping was a little slow but this DVD is in excellent condition- I watched it on the same day I received this DVD through mail and it went smoothly- didn't have any problem. :-D I'm happy about it. Thanks! :-D
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I was so excited to receive this! The West Wing has got to be the best television series I have ever watched! Imagine my shock when the first time I opened this, the plastic covering on top cracked right away! I just figured it was a fluke and was still too happy about receiving it to care too much about it. The next time I opened it to show my daughter, the whole bottom half of the case came apart! I now have to send it back and wait another week to receive the new one. I hadn't even watched one disc yet! I had read a lot of other complaints about the packaging and thought these people were overreacting. Now I know that it is true, the packaging may look like it was expensive to make, but it it very cheaply made!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it!!! Can't wait till the season starts back up! The show is great, just wish the ordering was easier. Have problems ordering every time.
B0067TQQI8|1.0|I received it yesterday.<br />Unfortunately, it seems to be used or at least opened and tried.<br />There are scratches and no protective film on the screen.<br />There is no instruction manual and the box is torn on sides.<br />I was really disappointed
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Tight fit but very handy. Will not work with case. Barely fits without and scared ill break it each time. It could use a little more give.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie is so much fun! I truly enjoyed it!<br /><br />So many cute and heroic men in one place makes it the perfect movie for Moms everywhere.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love, love, love this book.  I have been a King fan for a long time and enjoyed every minute I with the book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter. Is 5 and watches My Little Pony on Netflix all the time. This game entertains her and she loves seeing her favorite characters on screen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use it everyday when I get up to decide what to wear... accurate.<br /><br />I highly recommend this app and it's free!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I want to like these headphones but I find that this earbud style is a bit painful in the ears. I probably in the future will buy a pair of over the ear headphones. All that said, these work well and they are really durable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it. I was hooked from the start. Really well written and it kept you guessing about what the truth was.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enigmatis is a great who done it, first person adventure.  Many different locations with hidden objects and puzzel solving games.  A good mix.  Cant wait for second installment!
B00AMS38YU|5.0|If you like riding,  this movie is for you. \\"Steel frame,  fixed gear... No brakes... ;-) Awesome.  Watched it twice in a row.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|I love this movie!  There have been a lot of classic cartoons & whatnot getting live action movie treatment these days, but the GI Joe is one of my favorites of them.  I went to the theater when this was out and saw it as a double feature alongside District 9 (which I hadn't originally planned to see but a friend had said it was good so I thought I'd see it too).<br /><br />The acting was pretty good and the action was pretty awesome.  LoL, it was funny seeing Christopher Eccleston in it after having seen him in Doctor Who.  It was cool to see the writer and director's ideas behind the start of everything and Cobra's eventual rise to commander of the enemy terrorist group.<br /><br />Originally I owned the DVD copy because I didn't quite have Blu-Ray capability when it had first come out, but not long after I had one I upgraded this to Blu-Ray.  Looking forward to seeing the sequel!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great, provides all the power info you to know regarding your kindle in a very neat way, I totally recommend it!
B001FB55I0|4.0|It's certainly no Judgment Day, but Salvation is still a pretty kick@$$ movie none the less!  Salvation covers some of the resistence after Judgment Day and John Connor's attempt to bring down Skynet.  The acting is good, the premis good, and the action is awesome!  'Nough said!
1465001123|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas! She is a big T. Swift fan! The pictures are wonderful and she was very happy to open it!!!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I am not typically one for watching musicals, but this one appealed to me, no doubt thanks to the fact that it involved classic rock...that's something I can get behind!  I think the only other musical films I really cared for all that much were [[ASIN:B0013D8LOK Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]] and [[ASIN:B001M5UDGS Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]], plus the One More Time With Feeling episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Beyond that, I am not typically into musicals.<br /><br />Rock of Ages was a lot more enjoyable to me than a lot of musicals because of the classic rock numbers in it, plus this film contained some quality humor and I like the actors in it.  My wife was going to go and see the actual musical play with her mom and we figured we should give it a watch and it was pretty entertaining.  Check it out if you're into classic rock music and whatnot.
B005CAATXG|5.0|Icon for Hire has quickly emerged to be one of my favorite bands ever!  Great music with positive lyrics.  I've gotten the chance to meet the band and they are wonderful people!
B001G7SS9G|5.0|I loved I Am Legend the first time I saw it!  I loved it even more when I saw the version with the alternate ending, and that's pretty much the way I prefer watching it because I hated what happened to Will Smith in the end of the original version.<br /><br />When this movie had first come out onto DVD and Blu-Ray, I initally picked up the DVD because I did not yet have Blu-Ray capabilities, but eventually I bought myself a PlayStation 3 and among one of the first movies I upgraded to Blu-Ray after a handful of classics was I Am Legend.<br /><br />I'd been familiar with the ultimate collector's editions of the film but never bought one at the time, mostly because money was tight and they were a bit more expensive back then.  However, I finally broke down and decided to buy one of them.  I already owned the Blu-Ray copy, and for the longest time I had seen a DVD ultimate collector's edition set sitting up on top of a cabinet containing movie sets at a local entertainment store I frequent, and I would always eyeball it when I was in there.<br /><br />Eventually the set hit $14.99, and a while later I had happened to have some Christmas movie & finally broke down and decided to buy it.  I loved that movie and I couldn't stand to see that cool set sit there and collect dust.  Having the Blu-Ray, I will always watch that, but I bought the set if nothing other than for pure nostalgia.  It has some cool collectibles and I just like owning it.<br /><br />So yes, this is a bit more of a story as to how I came across this than an actual review, but review wise...if you are a fan of this movie, this collector's set, whether Blu-Ray or DVD, is pretty cool and it would be a cool collectible for anyone who enjoys this movie.  I think eventually I'm even going to try and incorporate my Blu-Ray copy into it, if I ever come across a slim enough case.  But yeah, totally cool set...I love it!
B000YDE4AU|5.0|Great boots, although as everybody says they run big. I usually wear a 13 and since they don't have a 12.5 I ordered a 12 and they fit perfectly. They have almost zero break-in time and are very comfortable right out of the box. Not sure about the outsoles though, they are very soft and will likely have to be replaced shortly.
B0013ND36G|4.0|Although my first love in Terminator is Judgment Day, Rise of the Machines falls in 3rd place just after the original Terminator in my book, followed by Salvation.  I don't dislike any of the films though...they're all pretty good in their own respect, but Judgment Day simply is and will always be the best Terminator movie!<br /><br />Three is probably the best one though and tells of the events leading up to Judgment Day, when the machines attacked and took over.  Anyone who loves action and sci-fi and has not seen these films, then get on it, obviously starting with the first film.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I thought Looper might be a sci-fi futuristic type movie, but was pleasantly surprised that it was really about life and the choices you make and the impact they can have on others. I thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt was really good, but Bruce Willias was OK only. Definitely worth a rental.
0345803493|5.0|This book is a must read,  well all of the fifty shades of grey are I couldn't put them down.  I'm almost finished with the last book.  I'm trying to prolong it because I dont want it to end. Thank u E L James. I love these books and Mr. Christian Grey lol
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Super fun and very entertaining.  Easy to pick up and play.  Quite addictive and a great way to kill time.  Lots of players online.  Works great with Kindle.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Another great move that should be included in any collection of classic movies. It is truly an original and will always be one.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Great collection, i love the special features include on the movies, however i think they could put more effort on the bluray menus, they are pretty cheap and poor, i dunno why they decided to put crappy menus on all bluray movies.<br /><br />The video quality of the movies is awesome<br />great audio<br /><br />I recommend it for every matrix fan.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I just love Johnny Depp and Rango. The humor in it is priceless. I watch it over and over and never ever tire of it
0345803507|5.0|I love it. After reading the first book 50 Shades of Grey and 50 Shades Darker I could not wait to find out what happened next. I must say I am not disappointed. These books are wonderful to read and I wish there were more. That epilogue was fantastic. I hope she writes the entire 3 books again from Christian's point of view. An excellent book leaves you with either wanting more or leaving you quite satisfied. this one did both.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This is a most enjoyable CD. It brings back good memories and the different types of music make it most interesting
0345803493|5.0|I love it. After reading the first book 50 Shades of Grey, I could not wait to find out what happened next. I must say I am not disappointed. These books are wonderful to read and I wish there were more. An excellent book leaves you with either wanting more or leaving you quite satisfied. this one did both.
0792844890|5.0|Even if this is an older movie, it still is full of clever lines and witty sayings to please any audience
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is easy to understand and keep your interest. Worth the download. I will know more after playing for a while.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Another classic ny Jim Henson. It is a must for anyone who loves the many talents of the brilliant Jim Henson.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read most all Connelly books about Bosch or his half brother.  I'd rate this in the high end, but not the best to me.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|My grandson just loves this wonderfully creative CD. We watch it over and over and never tire of it at all
B0095T3H2U|2.0|I had very high hopes for this film after seeing the.commercials. It seemed hilarious so I rented it to help get me out of a slump. The movie is two hrs of awkward! All the funniest parts of the film were put into the commercials and not much more was in the film. The movie was more sad than funny.  It's not a comedy about things getting in the way of their engagement, but rather an engagement unraveling in the saddest of ways with a twist ending. Ended up making me feel worse than better.
B007SPPANM|5.0|My grandaughter wanted this for Christmas and I was happy to get it for her. It never fails to please .
B00005JMX6|1.0|boring plot, bad acting, bad rip off of risky buisnes, please don't waste your money or more importantly your time
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was so funny, I'm happy I rented it.  I think everyone would like this movie. Great movie to watch when you are bored or upset, it will lift your spirits.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|I thought it booked bad when it came out then bought into the hype...should have listened to myself.  Predictable and boring...
1451696191|5.0|i decided to read this book after watching the movie, and it is absolutely fantastic. i love how the author of the book also wrote the screenplay, so it stayed really true to the original story. i definitely recommend this book
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game when you want some down time or at an appointment or just need a time filler. my grandson loves the &quot;sounds &quot; and likes to play.  Only complaint would be too many &quot;prizes &quot; end in the gutter.
B008I6ZX1E|1.0|I specially bought this one because the image shows the book covers I was looking for. When the package arrived I felt scammed, the covers are the ugly ones, the ancient ones.
B00633W614|3.0|Very disappointed in the ending. There was no conclusion and you obviously have to purchase the next book to see the conclusion of the main plot in this book. It seems to be a money grabber.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Okay. I'm happy. Peeta and Katniss end up together. That was I wanted. If you don't read these books, you're missing out.
B009O07NMA|5.0|This album is wonderful!!! It was in great shape when I got it and my husband and enjoyed it very much!!! I recommend it highly to anyone who likes Blackhawk or David Lee Murphy or Sawyer Brown.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I used to use another texting app, but when I switched to kik, I instantly loved it because it is fast and easy to use!
B000W93CHC|4.0|I am a great fan of all Ken Follett's work.  He is a wonderful writer!  You are there - you experience it all.  I love the stories - history and adventure.  My only criticism is to the publisher - the print in the paper copy is ridiculously small!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run has always been a great game since the start! everyone can play this, and you can also compete with friends
B006YC74E8|4.0|This is a nice photo editing app, and has some good features for editing. I think it's a really good app, considering the price (free) and is good for editing normal pictures.
B005HSL626|5.0|fruit ninja has always been an addicting game! It's so fun to swipe the screen at high speed when playing the Zen mode one haha
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app is really cool because it has so many versions of the bible and has lots of different reading plans.This app always has a verse of the day and can remind you to read. Everyone should get this app.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like draw something, but sometimes it freezes on a commercial on my kindle,but other than that I think it's pretty good
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game. It has easy controls that usually work, and I have fun every time I play this game. I strongly recommend that you get this game!!!!
B002TXZRRM|5.0|This is a charming book which captures the delightful character of the people of Botswana, can never wait to open up the next chapter!
B005HSL626|5.0|I really like this game because it is easy to play and fun to play. You can play for fun or try for the little challenges to unlock things. Almost anyone can play this app, and everyone should get it.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|I have a few friends, the opinions of which I value, who really like these books, which is why I waded through the second. However, I found it rather like the first: too dark, way too many characters, and kind of boring, interspersed with scenes of riveting brilliance. I'm glad there is a TV show. I do not plan to keep reading this series.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I tried three different journal apps, and this app was definitely my favorite. You can create and customize a lot of notebooks with special covers, page numbers, page color, fonts, and more. You can even create a password to keep your writing safe. If our want to write, get this app!!!!!! You can also attach pictures to your pages. Pretty much all I can say is if you are reading this, get the app and you will love it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My six year old loves it.  Fun and looks good, with real voices from cartoon.  You can play without spending money if you are patient.  Things you buy just speed up process (considerably).  They do pester you to spend money and social network (connecting game to social network is an actual quest).  I also haven't found how to turn off in-game purchases for just this game, but will keep looking.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I like this app. it is a fun game, challenging, and you get to make your own stick man. It requires thinking, and each level is a nice length. The only thing I don't like is that you only get one life.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is one of the best books in the world.(besides the lightning Thief ,or the lost hero) it sucks you have to wait forever to read the fourth book!!!!!!!
B00884GR0W|5.0|You either have a story mode or explore mode story you can level up and upgrade your character explore mode gives you unlimited health and magic points but no levelling up
B001UV4XFG|4.0|As always, I liked the book better than the movie but at least I could tell- even in a 30 second TV spot- where the &#34;changed&#34; bits related to the book. Adding Riley's backstory was a nice touch.I'm not sure who was the &#34;best&#34; actor/actress this time out but I liked everything about Nikki Reed's delivery on her role as Rosalie from her telling Bela about her last human days to the fight training and battle scenes. The big battle barely resembled the book version but at least it was better than the Edward/Victoria-Seth/Riley mini battle which wasn't very good at all, shot on a set didn't help it at all. Bryce-Dallas Howard or Rachelle  Lefevre as Victoria?, not sure who's the better choice there.<br />The movie does look good overall and should at least &#34;get by&#34; for most fans, those new to Twilight will find plenty to watch even if you don't know all of the backstory.<br /> When I bought my copy of the &#34;special 2 disc edition&#34; of the DVD I also bought the Blu ray Amazon listed below it. Don't make that mistake- it has none of the extras the DVD set has. Do a Twilight Eclipse movie search, Amazon also sells a special edition Blu ray, that's the one to get.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is a really boring game and it takes forever to download and it costs a lot to buy people
B007IFZU5A|5.0|After &#34;One Second&#34;, I think this is the album I enjoyed the most. Excellent job! I really love you guys!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. Every sequel to the hunger games just improves and out does the previous book. This book was a lot more intense and surprisingly extra violent and somewhat gory, which took me by surprise. This is also surprising because by the end of part two you have almost no hope for the outcome of the situation, which only gets worse. The only happy part after part two isn't until literally the last two pages, which still ends on a solemn note. I heard they were making a movie of catching fire, which is expected to come out this year. I can't see how they would make a movie out of this book without it being rated R
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play Spider all the time and I have played it on my computer for years and I still enjoy playing this game.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I give this book 5 stars  this book is so funny I loved it so does my sister and of course me!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love how she stuck with pettea and never let anything happen to him.  Kinda of a tear between two different guys Gale and Pettea.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I give it 3 and a half stars.  It's very good for it's ambitions: comic book action figures brought to the big screen.  It's entertaining, and that's fine, not much else there from the standpoint of cinema.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books! They have such a great story and are  very unique. The 50 shades books are my favorite by far. I'm sure I will end up reading them again and again!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christian Bale Is great in this movie as well as the Hathaway girl. Really enjoyed all the action. Are movies getting longer Or is it just me?
B00013AXEE|5.0|A very helpful book on writing that many authors at the Tucson Festival of Books recommended.  You can't go wrong with this selection.
B0063IH60K|3.0|There were too many advertisements that would pop up during the game. It is nice it is free but I don't care for the pop ups.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|I really thought the picture quality would have been better. I was disappointed. Especially since I had recently lost my digital camera.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie, long just like and seems never ending (Just what I look for in a movie) The voice of batman is laughable like the first Dark Knight Film released. Amazing performances by everyone in the production. Would recommend seeing it if your one of the few people that haven't. Rent or buy your choice but I should've bought it because I want to see it again!
B006517W3G|5.0|I enjoy listening to this record but its still sad that she isn't here to record more.  Her voice and song writing will be missed.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I liked the humor in Seriously...I'm Kidding but was frustrated by the lack of material. I found myself wanting more when it ended
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|If you know this is Clancy and it will be long and unrealistic, it is excellent.  The premise is very good.
B005K17RU0|4.0|gives a lot of good info that is clear &amp; easy to understand. great visuals. tells you all you need to know on the first page.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I loved the story and the way it was written. I feel like I am experiencing the emotions of the characters in the story. She does a great job of explaining what everyone is going through, the fear, the confusion, the grief, the shock of finding out someone is not who you thought. Before I bought this book, I read several reviews that said they didn't understand why Emily wanted to kill herself and were disappointed that the reasons were not explained. They were explained in every single story about their childhood, in every single interaction between the characters. And I loved that. It was completely brilliant the way the author highlighted those defining moments in Emily and Chris's lives that lead up to her death, and used other characters to explain some of what she felt. I can see how other people would have missed those cues because they were so subtle, but the whole beauty of the story was in the subtlety. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because she hinted at certain things and didn't follow through. For example (spoiler alert - if you haven't read the book you won't want to keep reading!), when Mrs. Gold finds Emily's journal, we never know if she wrote anything about her rape; and when she finds out her husband is testifying for the defense she feels betrayed and angry, but those feelings don't seem to endure. They are only mentioned once, but I think the fact that they overcame those feelings would have been an amazing chapter to read. I liked that the Harte's relationship was restored and a hint of that journey was revealed to us, but I would have liked to see the journey the Golds took as well as I felt their relationship was in even more peril. At the end Chris begins to explore his feelings about what happened, moving away from his focus on how Emily felt about everything and really starting to discover his own feelings. That part was really powerful to me, and I wish the author would have expanded on that. I would love to see asequel to this book focusing on the relationships of the Golds and Hartes and Chris's life after the ordeal he suffered. So, in conclusion, while I loved the book, I felt certain things were unfinished and that is why I settled on four stars.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|A great film that was ahead of it's time entertaining and thoughtful.<br />For this time period the effects are surprisingly good.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this for Journey, but Flow and Flower were a very nice bonus. It's hard to describe the game for what it is without spoiling the experience. Unfortunately, it's short but it's remarkably beautiful, especially in 1080p. The game is also very easy, but that's not what makes it a good game. I played from beginning to end in one sitting, with the lights in the room off. It's very relaxing and makes you wonder what makes your journey so important. I felt bad when my character was struggling, and genuine accomplishment when it was over. It was almost like when you're getting &#34;into&#34; a book, and you forget that you're reading...<br /><br />Check out of video on Youtube of the first few areas to get an idea of how to play and the overall look and feel of the game. This one is very unique. Search &#34;Journey Gameplay&#34; or something.<br /><br />If you find yourself interested in this game, but think it's a bit pricey, I would recommend adding it to your wish list. I do this with a ton of games. You never know when a good deal will be offered. I paid about half for this because it went out of stock, but it was still offered with the understanding that it wouldn't arrive for a month.
1932100660|5.0|This book should be required reading in schools.<br />At least a must for any family that wants to live a quality , healthy life.<br /><br />Very thought provoking, scientific, reading that leaves you with some solid facts yo ponder.<br />Once you begin it is hard to put down and you won't look at your food the same way.
1401324649|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!  The characters were developed nicely! I thought the story was funny, sad and exciting!  I found myself rooting for the group. . . even Sadie. . . hoping they would all find happiness in the end!  I was also impressed with the translation of the story.  Loved the book!  There were a couple of times when reading about Allan's past that I found myself getting a bit distracted, but all in all, a great read!!

B000935TV8|5.0|A lamentable loss to music and endless frustration for music lovers that Rameau, this master of the orchestral writing, whose wealth of original melodic invention is underpinned by his lush and daring harmonic ingenuity, didn't write symphonies or orchestral suites and concertos like Bach or Haendel. A gap all the more paradoxical and surprising that, as Minkowski points out in his introductory note, Rameau lived in a time and place (Paris in the 1750s) that saw the birth of the French Symphonie, at the hands of composers like Blainville, Rousseau, Martin, Plessis, Gossec, Guilemain and Mondonville, and that he himself was the recognized master of orchestral writing, so much so that  his adversary Charles Coll&eacute; could pay him a back-handed compliment, saying that \\"he wanted to write music and to this end put everything into ballets, dances and violin airs\\" at the expense of what was, for Coll&eacute;, the core and essence of the opera, the genre in which Rameau primarily poured his musical genius: the \\"scenes\\" (arias and recitatives).<br /><br />Until Minkowski, other than Christophe Rousset's compilation of Rameau's Overtures ([[ASIN:B000004CYY Rameau: Overtures]]), the closest one could get to the symphonies Rameau never wrote were the orchestral suites excerpted from his operas, made of freely chosen selections from the ballet and pantomime numbers (strangely called \\"Airs\\", but NOT sung). And after all, it was Rameau himself who established the precedent for doing so, when he published, shortly after the original run of the opera production, not the complete score of Les Indes Galantes, but a selection of four Suites or \\"Concerts\\", reshuffling the original orchestral numbers not in the order in which they appeared in the opera-ballet but according to tonalities (in truth, Rameau added some sung arias and chorus numbers as well, and one complete act, that of the \\"Savages\\", written after the opera's initial run and not yet performed when the score was published; also, the score was not an orchestral one, but a reduction for keyboard).<br /><br />So Minkowski's approach is different: instead of selecting from one or two operas or opera-ballets, he freely picked 16 numbers from eleven of them, to which he added \\"La Poule\\" (The Hen), the 6th Concert en sextuor (in fact an anonymous transcription of a piece Rameau originally wrote for harpsichord). Those operas and opera-ballets are: Zaïs (Overture - great idea to open the \\"imaginary Rameau symphony\\" with precisely that overture, which, in Rameau's own words, \\"depitcts the disentangling of Chaos and the shock felt by the elements as they are distilled\\", but also, as annotator and specialist of French baroque music Philippe Beaussant points out, the birth of harmony from original disorder, in a practical and sonically sensuous illustration of the composer's theses on harmony as basis of music), Castor & Pollux (the Funeral Scene from Act II scene 2), Les Fêtes d'H&eacute;b&eacute; (Air tendre from Act II - called \\"Entr&eacute;es\\" in opera-ballets - scene 5 and Musette en Rondeau & Tambourin en Rondeau from the Third Entr&eacute;e), Dardanus (Tambourins from the Prologue), Le Temple de la Gloire (Air tendre for the Muses from Act II), Les Bor&eacute;ades (Contredanses en Rondeau from Act I scene 4, Gavottes pour les Heures et les Z&eacute;phirs and Polymnies Entry both from Act IV scene 4, Prelude to Act V), La Naissance d'Osiris (Air gracieux), Plat&eacute;e (Storm from Act I scene 6), Hippolyte & Aricie (Act III Ritournelle from the 1742 revision), Naïs (Rigaudons from the Prologue), Les Indes Galantes (Danse des Sauvages and, to top it all off, the Chaconne from the Fourth Entry).<br /><br />The music is great, Minkowski plays it with his customary bubbling energy, which doesn't precude moments of hushed poetry in the slower numbers, and a great sense of instrumental color, and the disc makes for 56 minutes of unalloyed pleasure, but it does leave one frustration, I find: not for what it includes, but for all that it leaves out. It is not just that, as long as he was going to freely pick from all of Rameau's compositions, Minkowski might have offered 76 minutes of it rather than 56. When the success of Hippolyte & Aricie established overnight the fame of the then 50-year-old composer, his colleague Campra said - possibly another one of those back-handed compliments - that he had written in that opera enough music to make ten of them. You might think that Minkowki's selection lets you hear the best of the best, \\"la cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me\\", and that it would be THE ultimate Rameau orchestral selection. Not so, and I can't say that it is any better than the CDs offering orchestral suites from only one or two operas, like those of Frans Br&uuml;ggen ([[ASIN:B00000E3JD Rameau: Les Boreades Dardanus (Suites)]], [[ASIN:B00000E4AS Rameau: Castor Et Pollux Suite / Purcell: 3 Fantasias]], [[ASIN:B000FG5PJA Rameau: Les Indes Galantes Suite]], [[ASIN:B001HADENM Jean-Philippe Rameau: Orchestral Works]], [[ASIN:B00005Q39V Rameau - Orchestral Suites ~ Naïs · Zoroastre / Orchestra of the 18th Century · Br&uuml;ggen]]). Rameau has writtten enough beautiful orchestral music to make up 10 or 20 discs like the one of Minkowki, and this 56 minutes simply ain't enough. In fact, I find the 70 minutes of Overtures played by Rousset (see link above) to be the best introduction to Rameau: you get 17 such introductions for the price of one, and they are all fab.s out.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoyed the &quot;mindless&quot; fun this game provided. Great way to tune out for a bit. I would recommend it.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|One of the best things about musical movies is the soundtrack.  We all know that.  This one leaves nothing to the imagination and collects the major hits from the film.  Cheaper than in a music store or even a second-hand place, it was a great purchase.  Just needed a bit more Cher to round it out... but then again, I felt that way about the movie itself.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|its really fun and cool me and my bro play it all the time i enjoy it so much its about this stickman whos friend ( u get to draw both) gets eaten by a book and u have to go in /he book and get him!!!
B002ZG9774|5.0|I personally always try to buy a Blu-ray/DVD combo because even in this day and age not everyone has a blu-ray player.  For the price of this movie and the fact that it's still semi-new release, it's a great buy.  Much cheaper than in any store, and I got it brand new, never been opened.  Always a great find when buying something off the internet.
B004G600A4|5.0|I've been disappointed with most of the movies they've released in recent years.  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and my wife likes it a lot too.  It has a good sense of humor and is appropriate for younger viewers, which sadly is not true of many of the animated movies these days.
B008S7EPXA|4.0|Not only does this music sound amazing live (I was fortunate to see them in Montreal), but what you get on the disc is a really well structured journey. It has just the right amount of elements from their previous works, but you can hear their solo work influencing each other. A very welcome return.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We have the original perplexes. And had to get this one. It's much more challenging than the original one. But it's ver addicting. Once you pick it up. You just can't seem to put it down. This is a great puzzle/game. Awesome for road trips, (short or long ). Great way to keep the kids occupied and off video games and computer. Great for all ages. From young kids all the way up to the parents and the elderly. Can't wait to see what the next one will be like.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I love this movie...the science of studying and chasing twisters if fascinating and I've always loved Helen Hunt as an actress...the dynamics between all the characters is fun to watch...great flick
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I gave The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel five stars because it was a great movie; great cast, wonderful plot and overall well done.<br />It made me laugh it made me cry and made me think - what more could you want?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I haven't read in years.  I began reading after seeing the movie.  I could not put The Trilogy down.  I look forward to more Suzanne Collins books!
B004HX4RT6|2.0|had gotten this for our grandson and his Dad. They have since gotten their own Kindle with Chess on it. So, I will probably end up deleting itt.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I felt that since I am at my computer a lot, having the Bible handy was an asset for me.<br />Every person who needs to have the Bible at their finger tips should get one.It's free.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved the characters and the writing. I am going to reread it because I don't want to miss a thing. I do find it hard to believe that real teenagers would talk the way Hazel and Gus do but it is integral to the story. My life has been changed in a positive way by this book...I think your's will be too.
B002ZG98C8|3.0|Andy Trejo has been a pretty well kept movie secret, with a few odd appearances here and there (most memorably in Breaking Bad) but this is definitely the perfect vehicle for his talents. Accompanied by an all star cast highlighted by Robert De Niro, a sexy as hell Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Jessica Alba and even Don Johnson (!) but the definite highlight for me was watching Steven Segal as a the drug overlord and his hilarious Mexican accent. This is an homage to the exploitation films from the seventies with that particular Robert Rodriguez touch, and definitely his best pictures since Sin City.<br />For a dose of some fun over the top action movie you can hardly do better, definitely recommended
B005OCFHHK|3.0|The disks were great but the packaging not so much.  THe case was broken when recieved but the movies are in good shape and play well.  Great pictures.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I like movies like these and other Paramormal events.  So I enjoyed watching it although I have seen some movies that were better.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really love her workouts as I always feel the burn.  She is motivating with all of her disks that she offeres.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|This is truly indeed another Roots album minus a little dirt.<br /><br />Simply based on the artistry of its tracks, you have to rate this album somewhere between the scale of 3.88 - 4.3 stars.<br /><br />The only hindrance to How I Got Over is its sound. It sounds waaaay too polished. I don't know whether this polished sound is due to a scrub down(multiple takes) in the studio or an increase in their musicianship. Sonic-ally, this album is beautiful.... damned near flawless in its delivery. The one thing its missing is the grit and groove from Things Fall Apart. I believe it was the imperfections in Things Fall Apart that contributed to its brilliance.<br /><br />Nevertheless, here's my breakdown track by track:<br /><br />1. A Peace of Light: Kinda of a strange intro to set the mood of the track. Vocal doo's mixed with keys, bass, and drums. The hihats & snare on this track is really snappy and gives the track movement.<br /><br />2. Walk Alone: Good piano, drums, and vocals. But something about it although the mood is somewhat sad... seems a bit lacking.<br /><br />3. Dear God 2.0: This is where the CD should've started. This song touches on a sense of spiritually and taps into that groove The Roots are known for.... vintage Roots track.<br /><br />4. Radio Daze: Good Chorus.... but lyrics seem a bit loose (almost lacking rhythm). It's cool, but I often skip this track.<br /><br />5. Now or Never: This is no doubt one of the best tracks on the CD. Good groove, good chorus, and melody.<br /><br />6. How I Got Over: Kinda Retro vibe.... very good track.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show! They have held onto their appeal without devolving into a bunch of unfunny \\"inside jokes\\" like so many shows do. I didn't like the price of the episodes. They were almost $2 each for non-HD. That costs a lot more than it would if I got DVDs in the store.
1476715904|5.0|I finished Slammed, Point of Retreat and Hopeless all in one week...I couldn't put them down.  Which, of course, made for some very rough mornings. Colleen Hoover is an amazing new author.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it. fun way to waste a few hours. side bar announcing events on the right side a little irritating though.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I could see why so many do, good for young adults at the high school level and up, scary for a parent.  I prefer Catcher in the Rye.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I admit, I am way too old to be watching this movie. My son is almost an adult, and me...well come on. But, something about it made me want to tune in. So I did.<br /><br />I found this movie to be charming. Good story line, Nice characters, and a great ending.<br />I am certain the Keeper is my favorite.<br /><br />I think parents wont mind watching this with their little ones.
B00957T6X6|4.0|The only Issue I have with the kindle edition of this book is that when you look to see what page/location/% through the book you are at, it give you the information based on the total length of all five books combined, so you're never quite sure how far you are through the book you are currently reading.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is always awesome, no matter what age you are. Everyone should have this classic at home to watch during the holidays.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I enjoyed the entire story. The actor's were fantastic in their roles. The story was powerful and very true to life. I can see why a lot of people might not enjoy. It is difficult to look at our defects and be willing to take action.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The movie is definitely one for the Glee followers.  It does ring of the typical '80's storylines but still fresh and funny.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|One of the very few paid apps that I own, but one of the finest. If I was forced to delete apps, this one would not even be considered. Runs a very close second place to Google Maps as my most used app.

B004QX07G4|5.0|You hear Ellen in every word of this book, and her random thoughts make up most of the book. It is a light, easy, fun read that kept me giggling in public places, causing stares from strangers. Her confident, crazy self comes through in every chapter.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is so scary . When I had seven of eight the slender man piped up from behind and I was dead in 2 seconds
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this game!!! so cute!!! so addicting!!! totally worth it!!! I would for sure recommend getting it!!! it is just as cute, funny, and awesome as cut the rope and cut the rope experements!!! this app rocks!!! get it!!! :)
B000JML7YC|5.0|Most of Jane Austen's novels are a litany of life among the idle rich but, in my opinion, this is one of her better novels. It has a real story with meaning and is an insight to life in the very early 1800's. In some ways, especially in the realms of social behaviour, nothing has changed that much. Of course this applies to normal intelligent people not some of the morons around today although they probably existed then but were dismissed as irrelevant. Northanger Abbey is so refreshing after reading most books today that seem obsessed with sex. There's plenty of it in Jane Austen's books but it isn't hammered into your face and leaves most of it to your imagination. If you want to read a book in the same vein but a little more explicit try: The Modest Samaritan
B00A757EFW|3.0|This game is just like I remember it. It is entertaining and fun to play. There is no violence involved, which is good.
B0065AVWGU|4.0|I saw this movie on a website titled &#34;50 best nerd movies&#34; so I decided for $10 to watch it. Turned out to be a good choice.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This is a great movie that really makes one think about how much we don't know about the world around us.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always enjoy anything by Nicholas Sparks! This book kept me on edge, couldn't wait to read the ending to see how it would end! I have it on my Kindle Fire.
0060899220|5.0|This book can be quite funny at times, but also puts for some brutal honesty about the food industry. A great read for anybody thinking about working as a chef or in a kitchen.
B006VJMZXY|4.0|A frustrating and somewhat depressing story but easy and fun to read with quite a fast pace, I found this the perfect book to devour over two days on summer holiday.  Light, interesting and enjoyable.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This is a great movie that really causes one to think about the world we live in and what would happen should a nuclear event occur.
0545425115|5.0|Hunger Games is about Katniss Everdeen, a young girl who lives in District 12. Her father died at a young age, and from then on she had to take care of her younger sister Prim and her shocked mother. She snuck out under the electric fence that borders the District, and hunted for food using her bow and arrow.  At the Reaping, which is the time of day where they select the tributes, Katniss's sister is chosen to be in the Games. Knowing that Prim knows nothing of survival, and Katniss is more skilled in hunting, Katniss offers to take her place.  The rest of the book is about Katniss preparing for the Hunger Games and the Hunger Games itself.<br /><br />-The book is a very eciting book and very easy to get into beccause of all the action that is in it.<br /><br />-It takes place in the usa after world war 3 when every thing got destroyd.  the charicters in the book are pritty real to me because its just a girl that has been hunting her whole life so she has become very well with the bow and arrow but the boy isnt very real to me because in the begginning of the story they dont really talk about what he is really good at, and then all of a sudden he is this strong kid that we havent seen before.<br /><br />-i thought it was very cool how they rubbed a little lotion on the injury and the wond was gone the next day but it was to fictitious.<br /><br />-this was probibly the best book i have throughtout the whole thing and it is a great book for all ages to read<br /><br />-this book is good for every that can comprehend the words, and its a book for both male and females<br /><br />- 5 stars

B003GDYN24|5.0|This is the same Kelis that sang Milkshake? I'm surprised! If I didn't know, I'd think it's an entirely different person! Love the electronic music and her voice and lyrics fit in well! The entire album is gapless, meaning the songs are blended together as if you're listening to a dance club DJ.
B005LAII12|4.0|It is a funny, hilarious movie.  When first watched the movie, there were several spots where the movie skipped or hesitated/stuck.  Need to clean the DVD and see if that helps.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Good as the past heroes of Olympus books can't wait until the next book. Hope Percy and managers escape! Yay
1449410243|3.0|The book started out great but lost alot of steam in the middle. It lost its humor and became boring.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|We love this movie. Every Christmas season we watch it. A great reminder of the gift of life given by our creator. Every time I watch I have a tear or two at the end.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This book was a slog to read, too much of a travel log and not enough real action. There was some intrigue and DeMille's other books with this main character are very good (better than this one)... there is some wit but it gets tiresome. The action towards the end is timid. There are a few good quips and some interesting plotting, but this book is a couple hundred pages too long
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|This was given as a gift to my much younger cousin and she loved it. She' s already viewed multiple times. Definitely a good buy for those girls that are already obsessed by the dolls.
B004KZDV8E|4.0|Very good processor but still I have not tested to check its functionality total.<br />I recommend them as the product reached its destination rapidemente<br /><br />thanks in advance
B007TNS6JI|1.0|So I got this app then I needed to download something idk what it was but I knew I wouldn't mess anything up because I've done the same thing on another app so I waited for it to download or whatever then it just stopped downloading so I went on the app and it just started all over, I'm not sure if I did something wrong but this made me really mad

I contacted their support department who did not help at all. they sent me on a wild goose Chase to try and get a refund. bought the skin app because both my daughter's wanted a pink calculator. Now only one has<br />it and I can't get a refund.  total scam don't buy
0143121006|5.0|A well-researched story of the unsolved murder of a diplomat's daughter in pre-War Peking.  The author gives us an accurate and compelling picture of life in that then-international city, and manages to convey the obsession with justice that Pamela's father--an unpleasant and largely unlikable man--brings to the hunt for her killer.  The book is a remarkable piece of research based on newly found journals and existing historical records.  Utterly fascinating from an historical perspective, as well as a murder mystery peopled with all the eccentric, noble, and mercenary characters one encounters in the expat life.  As usually happens when a personal tragedy interdicts diplomatic concerns, justice has been long delayed.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Hybrid cross between Lost and X-files - the characters are well thought out - the stories well integrated in the Fringe genre
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I felt this read was a better fit for the young adult population. After a few chapters I was fully intrigued by the depth of the characters and the twists in the story line. It was hard to put down.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|simply put it does what it says. I never give 5 stars&hellip;there is always room for improvement. Every one is talking about the Kondle having problems, I have been using it on my Kindle Fire for about two months, no problems, knock on wood.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have a  lot of fun playing this with my seven year old grandson. He draws well, and this helps him with reading and spelling also. He will check this ap to see if there is a game waiting before he goes to the shoot-em aps which goes over well with Grandma!
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have a 2005 Prius with a Dice iPod adapter installed. That's been fine until the new dock connectors came out for iPhones, etc., and the Dice will only deal with twelve playlists, so I had a dedicated iPod Nano in the glove box with it. This allows me to run ANYTHING with a headphone jack through my stereo now, and I couldn't be more pleased. I'm seriously considering rigging an installation that gives me an Aux input somewhere on the dash :)
B0086700CM|4.0|The game has a simple concept and is verry tum to see how far u can get. but the store is flustrating. if u want to get a new guy or something cool like that there is like no way that people that are new to the game can get it if they don't want to spend any money.but the game is fast and fun and is great when u r bored.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|I am a big Michael Buble fan, but I just did not like this Christmas album.  I have four of his CDs and love them.  I don't know why this one didn't work for me.  His voice was as great as always, but I guess I didn't like his take on many of the songs.  I would've returned the CD if I wouldn't have had to pay return shipping.  I decided to donate it instead...not one that I would've listened to again unfortunately.  But, I highly recommend his other CDs.  He is a wonderful singer and I remain a huge fan.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game is horrible!controls are weird and don't work.its graphics are horrible compared 2 minecrafts. impossible 2 to find anything. bad gliches like random jumps, inability to move,and dissapearing blocks. so dontget the full game or u will have wasted 5 bucks.
B000SEFDP0|1.0|How many times did I read George Dora? Or miss a line from one page to the next? Or get dashes in the middle of a line? Truly great book, appalling (and expensive) Kindle version. Buck up your game, publishers!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I hardly ever review a product but this time I had to because Im extremely happy with this headphone, I bought them to play my Bass guitar and not bother anyone. The clarity coming out of this headphones are amazing and you can hear every little ding the string makes. I also hooked them up to my Ipod and music has great quality sound. Overall they are great headphones.
B00846REIS|5.0|NOT as good as 50 Shades of Grey but it was really good! Now I a m bummed that I have to wait until May for the final book to come out!!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|More great writing from this author and my son loves it. He has re-read this book twice. It keep him interested in reading and that works for me his mom.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A well-written use of an all-to-commonly used device, time travel, with a whole lot of imagination applied, but not too much. One of King 's better stories, and one you can most certainly read without putting down if you wanted to.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|More of the same humor and great writing from the author. My son loves this book and read it within a couple of days. He is 8.
1449417051|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it for our 13 year old daughter who loves cats. The reviews talked about how funny it was, but I saw nothing about the language or type of humor. We gave it to her for Christmas and she was not impressed. She told me I should have read it first. Neither of us found most of it funny and there is definitely things mentioned that are not appropriate for children. I really thought it would be about humorous things cats do that might indicate their true intent or feelings toward their owners. There's only a couple of pages of that and the rest was boring.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I just got a new android.  Amazon has the best apps.  Easy to find & easy to download.  I'll keep coming back for more.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|For anyone who likes/loves sonic the hedgehog, you will love this game. My son purchased it for free, and loved it so much he wanted to pay for the extended version which we bought and of course he loved that too. I even played it and it brought me back to my childhood of when sonic was on sega genesis back in the day! Totally worth buying the game. Sonic continues to please all generations! :)
B003B02PEU|5.0|Haven't finished reading it yet, savoring every moment.<br />Haven't read a book by John Grisham yet that I didn't like.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I really enjoyed part 2. I couldn't wait to check it out when I saw the initial trailer for it. Hopefully others will enjoy this as much as I did. This will definitely have you wanting more. I will pick up the best buy release when it hit the stores for the joker figurine that comes with it. Very dark, the way batman should be seen. Loved it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|So many books about death/murder are told from the side of the family of the victim(s), sharing their grief and loss.  This book goes to the other side, sharing with its readers the heartache, sorrow, questioning a family goes through when your family member is the murderer.  I LOVED that perspective in this book and because of that could NOT put this book down.  A definite need to read!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I thought it was fun but did not really want to write a review. Just wanted to stop the pop up.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Too bad it has taken so long for this man to become well known in his own country. The people in Africa got it right!

B009O5CLZY|1.0|I purchased this game ON MY KINDLE and it just refuses to download. Please fix this error asap! Very frustrating
B008NB0SQO|5.0|The visual transfer on this blu-ray is fantastic, especially for a movie involving mostly puppets that was made in 1992. Worth it for the movie alone, but also includes some great extra features.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Ireally like this show! It was well written and the actors were first rate. All scenes were well balanced and nothing seemed out of place for its story line.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Childhood sweethearts seem to be something my grandparents reminisced about but I could never associate with. I loved the love, tragedy and drama this book seemed to be able to encompass.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I needed to catch jup so I can eventually see season 3. This is so much fun, all the supense and love and dastardly deeds of a soap opera. Only, done much better.
B00129H7VS|5.0|To me, Band of Brothers is the single greatest thing ever made for television and this is an excellent collection of the series.  Fantastic picture and sound quality and great feature set.  The box itself is also outstanding.
B006VREHRS|2.0|I had been looking forward to watching this series for quite awhile.  I watched the first two episodes and honestly now have no interest.  It seem to be &#34;arty&#34; for no reason and included shock value for no reason.  I also simply never cared about the characters.  A real disappointment.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|A seminal work by the greatest economic mind of the 20th century and every word still holds true today.  The free market as described by Friedman is THEE path towards making a country as the Founding Fathers described, in which the Pursuit of Happiness can be attained by anyone and done so independently.
B005MVLI8A|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this album that hasn't been said, contradicted, paraphrased and scrutinized backwards, forwords and at more rpm's more than a Beatles' album circa the mid to late-60's.<br />I count this album among the iconic objects that would bulge from my personal \\"time capsule.\\" Although I associate both manically joyful and ledge-skirtingly dark times with the songs on this album, it never frustrates me or makes me regret playing it. It's not so much that I discover new things each time I hear it intentionally or coincidentally. I marvel at the eerie, spontaneous relevence, pegging my slant du jour on life, regardless of the particular phase through which I find myself earnestly stumbling. The songs are deliciously accessible, uncannily intuitive, evoking waves of somehow anything buy non-mutually exclusive invasive/welcome penetrating junctions that intersect,to conversational inroads charted by the Davinciesque nakedness of bluntly confessed<br />lyrics and unpretentious emotions. Few other classic rock albums can recreate. Even though this album was called \\"Alternative Rock,\\" it is at its core unselfconscious Rock 'n' Roll with its simplicity and palpable descriptions of the human condition. Nirvana's surgically accurate capacity to erect songs that neither glorify or self-aggrandize the band members' familiar growing pains and akward metaphysical revelations includes us in an ardent discussion that we could just as easily be having in our own living room after too many beers, tenderly tracing our own new scars fresh from uncautious emotional end-overs. I'm so grateful to have been intellectually mature enough (arguably) when it came out that was able to take it in. I appreciate how I have this relational logistic rapport with Nirvana through their well-thumbed musical photo album and mark time by its advent. It has long since now become a landmark in the panorama of my own chronology and personal voyage nto and through functionalmythology. Far from generic, Nevermind includes us in the cryptic in-joke unlike so many ethereal abstract poets who seem to serenade their own demons with no epilogue or backstory to guide the listener. This musical teain rebounds pole to pole, nevef reaching the end of the line and always saving a seat for us to dismount and reboard at will.ar from generic, Nevermind includes us in the cryptic in-joke unlike so many ethereal abstract poets who seem to serenade their own demons with no epilogue or backstory to guide the listener.

B004LWZWGA|4.0|It took me a couple of days to watch this movie.  As I did I could not help but think about the tragedy that took place when it opened somewhere in the US.<br />It is unfortunate that is has not been nominated for any Oscars as it should have been.<br />The performances of the lead characters in particular Anne Hatthaway and Marion Cotillard as well as Caine and Bale as really superb.  Oldman truly embodies the Gordon role and for those who are fans of the Batman comics this is a really good movie.  I recommend it but be prepared to watch it in two installments because it is long - can't wait for the next one.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Geat musical and the blue ray version is fantastic. It is so real like and crystal clear. Great cast and music
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I know there ae a ton of Harry Potter Movie Collections out there but my husband and I just wanted the regular edition movies at a low price. We did not need the extras. So I was really excited when I seen this set, it was just what we were looking for. Movies are packaged a lot like a TV Series would be so it is easy to shelve.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I am not sure if this book is a real life story, or it is fiction. It is an amazing story, one filled with facts that make it seem a true experience. The only thing that makes me wonder is is floating island as it doesn't seem real.
0345803485|5.0|I know this may just be me but none of the sex scenes were as bad as people made it out to be. As an independent female I understood everything she was going through and loved that she was able to get him to see who he really was as well. However, the ending is a little disturbing. The only time in all 3 books I had a knot in my stomach.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Really like this movie.  The story follows the book pretty well, the animation is just amazing, the songs are clever and not annoying.  Danny DeVito is a perfect fit for the Lorax.
B000MAH5O2|5.0|I feel I know the President 's heart after reading this book.  It is very well written and holds the interest of the reader.  Although there areas I would disagree on moral issues, other areas of  policy and philosophy are extraordinarily gratifying.  After reading the book I am convinced of his capability and determination to be the President of ALL the American people.  I believe him to be a great leader in the free world.  Anyone who reads this book with an open mind will better understanding which he is and where he wants to take our country and how he wants to influence the rest of the world.
030758836X|3.0|This is a decent book but not as good as I anticipated it to be.  It is gotten so much hype,I thought it would be more interesting.
B00005K3O4|5.0|...then this is the movie for you. The only people who would not like this movie are those that would not even start looking at the reviews. It's top quality and a real winner. This is the type of movie you will watch many times over the course of the years.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game me and my kid liked it. we had built a big zoo or what ever your making. So I relly liked it I played the night and she played the day.

B004J4WLPU|5.0|This book was very well written, she did a good job holding my attention and the ending was a great surprise
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I am rating this book 4 stars, not because I didn't love it, but because one day I may read a more perfect book. Althought, I find that hard to believe. I would recommend this to everyone from young adult on up.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Converted by the same people that did over half of Transformers Dark of the Moon. Having seen a 14 minute preview of the 3D at a screening, I can say with confidence that this is going to be an amazing 3D experience.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|Unfortunately this show doesn't represent the true talent of what Cirque is and does it does a nie job of capture the spirit with its 3d!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham kept me in suspense until almost the end of the book. Very well done. a real page turner, even for an e book
B005EGXTL2|1.0|After really enjoying the first 2 books in the Hunger Games trilogy I was looking forward to reading this one.<br />Sadly, the further I got into it the more disappointing it was....and as it neared its conclusion it just got downright silly.<br />Didn't even bother finishing it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I am grateful for this BEAUTIFUL story. I am reminded that boundaries are to be pushed and to question everything. These are things that life has caused me to forget. Thank you Colleen!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I purchased this book because of the reviews and overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I felt it was, for the most part, well written with enough humor and touching moments to keep me interested. It was great...almost perfect.<br /><br />Here are a few reasons why I loved it:<br /><br />1. I loved the humor between the characters. It takes a LOT for a book to make me laugh right out loud and I did this time and again with Hopeless. There were hilarious moments and beautiful, touching moments.<br /><br />2. I loved the plot development and unexpected twists. For readers like myself, who read a lot of books, too often I see what's coming before I get there. Although I could sense the twists and turns along this 'ride', I didn't feel like I'd been on the ride before.<br /><br />3. I love a happy ending. I think the main characters are going to need some serious therapy (some of the situations were just a bit unbelievable) but it still ended great. I felt the story resolved itself well. With a little editing, I think this book could have been the perfect novel.<br /><br />Here are a few of the reasons why I struggled with it (and they're minor): (**Spoiler Alert**)<br /><br />1. I had trouble getting past the first chapter. It didn't grab me and keep me interested. I literally started reading this book three times before I FORCED myself to just keep going. Once I got into it a bit, I liked it. A lot. But it took a bit of force.<br /><br />2. I felt like Hoover shoved a whole lot of topics into one book. Parenting issues, rumors and reputations, hate crimes, sexual abuse, suicide, kidnapping, first love...and on and on. I wasn't sure where she was headed at any one time and it made it a little...crowded at points. I felt it needed a bit of editing, a little bit of focus. Fewer dramatic events or subjects with more time to deal with each one.<br /><br />3. I enjoy a book with a good moral as much as the next reader, but there were several occasions where I feltHoover was trying too hard to express that moral using character dialog which seemed long-winded and forced. Most of the time, the dialog was fresh and funny or sweet and wonderful. I just wish that, in her desire to reach out and let the reader understand the \\"moral of the story\\", Hoover had done it in a less obvious, less wordy manner, especially during the final chapters of the book. Every time one of her characters started to lecture the other about one of these morals, it felt like I was getting kicked out of the book. Like the story was taking a commercial break for a public service announcement or something. I felt like the point was getting slapped in my face when really, all I needed was a gentle nudge. This is when \\"show, don't tell\\" and \\"less is more\\" really come into play. Something easily solved with editing.<br /><br />Despite my few struggles (which again, were quite minor), I really liked this book and would recommend it.
B007P06DJK|5.0|The last copy of this album was a cassette tape!  On CD the nuances can be heard even better.  An amazing record then and still one I would choose if fate leads me to a desert island.  Love it!!!
0881889148|5.0|Great music!  My daughter loves this as the music is challenging but not too difficult to play.  This covers a lot of the Beatles songs.  (The other half is in Volume 1.)
B005NJU8PA|1.0|This book was so terrible - the author is so arrogant, but writes so poorly!  It is nonsensical and a waste of time.  This if the first book I've ever removed from my kindle.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as a stocking stuffer. He loves it. Plays it in the background while he studies for class. Beautiful music!
B000OVLBEY|5.0|Love Nicolas Cage in anything. This movie kept your attention with its characters and plots. Loved the whole movie entirely
B008133MDK|5.0|I will always love this show. It's ingeniously written and brilliantly acted by both main actors. The supporting cast are great as well, especially, the guy playing Moriarty. I cannot wait for season 3!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I loved the first season of this program and wanted to have it on DVD.  Managed to get my grown daughter to watch the DVD prior to Season 2 starting.  She's as hooked as I am.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love the lyrics and the sound. This is a great album that I enjoy listening to while I'm at work or reading a book at home.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I enjoy playing Bingo Blits on my desktop but I do not enjoy playing it on my kindle. It calls out a number and then hesitates and then calls about 6 numbers at once. You just can't keep up with it on the kindle.
B008EEB4TA|3.0|Fun album with some great pop songs that a great to dance to. If you like playful pop music then this is an album for you.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This arrived as our family was going through a horrendous time trying to help a relation in a very difficult situation.  The film absolutely inspired my eldest son to commit to being a mentor and an example to younger guys.  The film is somewhat episodic which makes it less powerful, but it carries a message we desperately need to remember.
B007MU85D0|5.0|If you like you music then you will like this album. Fun, creative, and great lyrics. If you like this band check out some of their videos on youtube as well.

030758836X|2.0|The story is very interesting!  However it seems the author just got tired of creating the ending of the story!!  Reading this book was like enjoyable until the end!  It seems like the author took you to the edge of a cliff and just left you disappointed.  This is a novel not a real life story!!

B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book starts out great with tales of how many people combated the zombie virus. It did its job, and that was to drag the reader in. About halfway through the book it switches to the political aspect of the zombie virus and then it just drags on and on until you can't wait till the end of the book

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful read!!!  Kept me engrossed the whole way through and had me wondering what was going to happen after just a few chapters!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved it! I would recommend it to others. It's kind of hard to stop reading the book when you get further into the reading all though I must admit I kept waiting for the sex scene and it never never happened. Other than that it was exciting!
B004WCTLNY|2.0|it is a very unusual movie. i just kept expecting for it to have a good plot. never happened. just wasn't my kind of movie
0425263908|1.0|I couldn't even finish this book. Way too much like Fifty Shades of Grey. No originality at all. Don't waste your time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much.  It took me to places I haven't been in along time.  Every chapter made me want more, I couldn't put it down.  The suspense, the strength, the love and loss and gain and the hope.  Amazing.
