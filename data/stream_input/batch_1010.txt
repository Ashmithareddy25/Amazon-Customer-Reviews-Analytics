1416972242|4.0|This volume was the perfect bridge to Volume 3, \\"City of Glass,\\" which I read in one sitting. Cassandra Clare does a great job of fleshing out what I think is a fairly accurate portrayal of the current American teenage mentality and attitude. Of course, this will date the book for readers even three years down the road, but still I found it refreshing in comparison to both the Harry Potter and Twilight series. It wasn't better than Harry Potter; it was distinctly more brash and slick than its British cousin. Maybe this makes it less adult-friendly, though I read it voraciously. Twilight it outshone by far.
0307454541|4.0|Finished TGWTDT yesterday and I still cannot pinpoint the exact reasons why this book is so good, it just is.  It takes a few chapters to get going which may be a turn-off for many.  My suggestion is, if you are willing to stick with it, then pick up this book and start reading. I found it helpful to go online and find the missing maps from the US edition, once the mystery part of the story got going. They can be easily obtained from fansites by searching \\"Hedeby Island Map\\".  Since Hedeby is a fictitious place, the location of a map should be near the top of the results page. A good fansite offering the maps is [...]. You will also find yourself referring to family tree at the beginning of the book. It is also very helpful to keep all the players straight. This novel deserves much of the hype that surrounds it. It has interesting characters and interesting locales. I love reading about foreign places and learning about experiences in other countries, so this book really suited me. If you like the same, go ahead and give this a try. Enjoy!
0156027321|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book! Captivating, hilarious in places, profoundly provocative. I really appreciated how the story, in many ways, ends up being about the act and process of writing itself.
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|For many of you out there, if it says Steven Wilson anywhere, then you're all over it.  I'm one of you!  I own every Porcupine Tree Cd ever produced, as well as some of Mr. Wilson's other stuff, like Blackfield.  All great.   This CD is good, but like others have said, if you're expecting Porcupine Tree 2.0 then you might be disappointed.  Once I got over that and listened to it for what it was, I actually enjoyed it.  It was definitely a slow burn, though.  I suggest you listen to it a whole bunch at let it grow on you.  I give it 3.5 stars.
0316776963|4.0|Another great book from Mr. Sedaris. All I can do to communicate his appeal is to quote him directly. From the essay \\"Smart Guy,\\" in which he takes an IQ test:     \\"It turns out that I'm really stupid, practically an idiot. There are cats that weigh more than my IQ score. Were my number translated into dollars, it would buy you about three buckets of fried chicken....When I became upset over my test score, Hugh explained that everybody thinks differently--I just happen to do it less than the average adult.     'Think donkey,' he said. 'Then take it down a few notches....Don't let it get to you. There are plenty of things you're good at.'     When asked for some examples, he listed vacuuming and naming stuffed animals.\\"
0393072231|3.0|I guess I really should not get too excited when Lewis comes out with a book because sometimes, like this time, he misses. If it were the first book out on the financial crisis or about profits from shorting, it would have been much better. As it is, the book would have made a nice New Yorker article [six months ago]. Lewis focuses too much on a small cast of minor characters [sorry-they are not interesting and they are minor] . His last chapter, of only 6 or 8 pages, is the real stuff- it gives an overview and talks about the major players. For a 260 page book, it somehow drags. Other books on the subject twice as dense are page-turners. This said, I can't wait for his next one. He's a great writer and interviews well.  Even when he writes a dud like this, it's still like a pretty nice dessert at Denny's.
0375846735|5.0|Though this third and final volume garners 4 stars, my rating here is really for the entire series. To be honest, finishing the series left me somewhat bereft, like when you were a kid during the Thanksgiving holiday and the last group of relatives has just departed for home. At the risk of sounding sappy, I read the last page and just sat there with a lump in my throat. The ending was absolutely heart-breaking! The novel brimmed with memorable, inventive landscapes: the land of the dead, the world of the \\"mulefa,\\" the apocalyptic battleground of the Heavens. This series will stick with me for a very long time. I have to admit to being a little troubled by reviewers who give the series a low rating simply for its anti-Christian slant. Isn't a trait of great fiction the ability to challenge the status quo without resorting to didacticism? Perhaps faith that is so easily shaken by a story of fiction ought to be reassessed.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|This is a wonderful album. Not perfect (My Body is a Cage and Fade Out could have easily been left off or better yet replaced) but what is left is filled with wonderful, soul searching, intelligent interpretations of some very beautiful songs. Maybe you have to be a little older and experienced in life to appreciate where a song- well and heartfelt by a sublime artist - can take you. It saddens me how music that requires some deep listening and reflection just gets dismissed as boring. I think we have lost much of our capacity for reflection and what gets sometimes gets labeled as tedious says more about our modern tendency to just scratch the surface of most things and to seldom, if ever, get at the heart and meaning of anything. This attempt by Mr. Gabriel definitely comes from the heart or at least has that effect. I have listened to songs from this album for weeks and find that they are continuously taking me, and I would imagine others, to other places and times. I listened to Lady Gaga the other day and found that her interpretations while filled with energy and provocation left me in a place that I found, frankly, a little depressing. More mechanics,dance hooks,sound and fury but not much meaning. Maybe with time she will move more in the direction that Mr. Gabriel has gone and,that does not mean boring. Talking Heads' \\"The Listening Wind\\" manages to be both enigmatic and starkly disturbing in charting the the arc of a terrorist's path to violence and murder.
037571457X|4.0|This books begins my foray into graphic novels. The exact definition of a graphic novel is debatable, but Wikipedia defines it as \\"a type of comic book, usually with a lengthy and complex storyline similar to those of novels, and often aimed at mature audiences.\\" Technically, this volume is a memoir, as it's the true story of author Marjane Satrapi's growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, told in comic-strip form. I figured, \\"Finally, a book that won't make me cry,\\" but of course, I was wrong. Maybe I'm just a cry-baby.     Though it took me only a couple of hours to complete, it was mesmerizing. I found it unabashedly forthright and ultimately heartbreaking. I appreciated Satrapi's illustrations which, in their broad-stroked black-and-white simplicity, were a stark, yet appropriate, departure from what most people recognize as that highly anatomical, Batmanesque comic-book style. I look forward to reading the sequel \\"Persepolis: The Story of a Return,\\" and also highly recommend the Oscar-nominated full-length animated feature film of the same name.
B000GB775E|2.0|Oh Lohan, didn't you learn anything from \\"Freaky Friday\\"?  You should never coy with fortune telling, because the plot device will just conveniently turn your life around and hope you'll learn something from the nightmare.  First, you were a 50-year-old Laurie Strode, here you became unlucky, and now you went from a career rise to a career splat.<br /><br />\\"Just My Luck\\" may not be as bad as [[ASIN:B000W1SZA4 her recent box-office disaster]], but this is still ridiculously uncanny.  The movie thought God likes to tempt fate with certain people, and so Lindsay Lohan's character is livin' the Mary Tyler Moore life while Chris 'James T. Kirk' Pine happens to receive crap on a sliver platter every step of the way.  Then convenience circumstances at a party happened when these two unknowns kiss after a warning form the fortuneteller, and their luck has switched.  Then Lohan's character faced the 'wackiest' of unfortunate situations, like gettin' splashed on by the road, getting her hair caught in a dryer, having her home flooded, and reduced to working in janitorial work, while Pine gets a high-paid job by a record producer and has a secretary/call-girl the within a day.<br /><br />There's a difference between luck and stupidity, and the movie doesn't quite get it.  The character who had bad luck seems more irresponsible than unlucky, considering most of their actions caused them to be unfortunate.  Pine picked up a dollar bill from a trash can, not thinking it could be dirty, and Lohan tried to replace a tube lightbulb while holding another one while standing on a ladder, these characters simply didn't think things through and I'm suppose to believe this is bad luck; come to think of it, I'm surprised bad luck itself didn't kill them earlier on.  Nevermind the whole good luck aspect which is handled absurdly and coincidentally, one has to be brain-damage to think they weren't graced with internal fortune.<br /><br />Everything here is set up like a Disney Channel Original Movie. All the jokes were cartoony, the cast overexert themselves with endless chatter, and the story is farfetched. I can understand it wants to be over-the-top, but it's not really funny.  The characters are so annoying, Lohan kept verbally defending herself every time she gets into a jam and Pine plays like a one-dimensional meat package.  \\"Just My Luck\\" is romantic shlock, all bubbly and asinine catering to the young girls for sleepovers.  To think the best moments were the ones where Lohan's character is in prison and she got her face clocked (twice). At least the movie didn't make that whole 'you make your own luck' speech, which after how divinely controlled it's set up, the message would be hard to believe.es were cartoony, the cast overexert themselves with endless chatter, and the story is farfetched.

1416914307|4.0|I read this book, all 541 pages, in one painful, back-wrenching sitting. I could not put it down. Grittier (more \\"American,\\" if you will, though not necessarily better) than Harry Potter, and simply more polished and nuanced than the Twilight series, this series was fast-paced, sharp, and intelligent, not to mention just plain entertaining.

0064430227|5.0|This book fascinated me as a kid! Not to get overly analytical, but the concept of creating a new world with a few strokes of a purple crayon really spoke to me in the broader sense of the power of creativity to open up a life.

B003CIG7AE|4.0|Band of Horses' latest album, Infinite Arms, is full of mellow alternative-country sounds reminiscent of Southern bands like My Morning Jacket.  The songs are well-constructed and executed, if not cutting-edge in terms of sound, style, or composition.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the overall tone of this album is fairly laid-back, but the songs include a nice variety of different sounds and melodies.  Some of the songs are accompanied with full instrumentation and layered vocals while others are more in the vein of a lean singer-songwriter sound.  In other words, this isn't one of those albums where every song sounds the same.  The band's existing fans should enjoy this latest album, and the album has broad enough appeal to reach new listeners.  All in all, Infinite Arms won't set anyone on fire, but it's an enjoyable album from a good band.

B003HE2B6C|5.0|i have been an avid hanson lover for 13 years and this has to be the best album by them ever,   waiting for this is catchy and sets the mood, thinking bout somethin shoud be the summers best single, when i hear it all i want to do it dance, kiss me when you come home is a nice slower jam. carry you there is one of the best songs lyrically by them, give a little and  and i waited are both ones that makes me want to scream the lyrics you love the song so much. make it out alive has an amazing musical range to it, these walls is classic hanson, use me up is Zac's best! musical ride and voice in the chorus are my 2 faves on the album they just get stuck in your head. and me myself and i is the longest slow hanson song but its def worth the 5 and 1/2 min    overall = AMAZING
1423113381|3.0|This book I bought on a whim because I love Egyptian mythology. So naturally I found one wrong error in this book. I like to point out that he made up the pharaoh that united Egypt, the real person was King Menes who united Egypt under a double crown. I think the author needs to do some more research if he wants to base his book off of a real culture.     Other than that I think the book was good over all. It's a nice book for little kids to enjoy.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|pretty simply put, this has a jam band feel to it! this is not my personal preference and therefore i did not care so much for the album! i like about half of it and all indications are this is the beginning of this style for tom petty! i will always have the old stuff i guess!
0007247095|5.0|You, and all other American citizens, really need to read this book.  It is powerful and overwhelmingly tragic.  At times, as you look inside this band of child warriors, you might begin thinking of this as a war story.  But then you realize that what you are reading is not fiction, and the horror of it grips you all over again.    I'm grateful that Ishmael survived and had the courage to write his story.  It is definitely an important work; a well-written glimpse of what is, tragically, a fact of life for child soldiers all over the world.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it first in the cinema. Probably one of the most underrated movies so far this year. It failed at the box office probably due to the shaky camera during action sequences and a cliche script. But you've got to give credits to the ambitious plot that was based on the real reason why the US went to war in Iraq. The reason was always for the search for Weapons Of Mass Destruction (WMD). In real life, it was a failure as no WMD's were found. This movie went all out in Hollywood fashion as we uncover the truth as to why the war started in the first place and the waste of resource used by the government for the search of the hidden WMD's in Iraq. Many lives from both sides were lost during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, all for something that doesn't exists in the country, the WMD's.. As Matt Damon's character mentioned in the movie, \\"The reason we go to war always matters!\\".<br /><br />This movie is a good movie depending on how you see it, but its not a bad movie as some critics have made it out to be. Looking forward to the dvd release!
0062009540|4.0|With the tv show coming out I decided it was finally time to read Pretty Little Liars! And boy am I glad I did! If nothing just the idea of the mystery had me going crazy trying to figure out what was going on!<br /><br />I love how the book alternates from all 4 of the girl's perspectives. Right off the bat I found Spencer to be the most interesting, always competing with her sister for EVERYTHING, including boys and Hanna to be the least interesting, she's a bit of a shoplifter and has overgone a pretty physical and social makeover. Not sure why but she doesn't interest me as much as the others.<br /><br />A lot of times in stories (and in life) of any kind people obsess about horrible things happening and then they never end up happening but in Pretty Little Liars they DO happen and it's really interesting seeing how the characters can go on from these massive blows. You don't usually get to read stories like this, at least I don't think so. It's also interesting how the story can stay together with these 4 girls not even being friends anymore really. You'd think it would make it harder to read, these 4 different totally separate storylines yet even though they aren't friendly they still need to depend on each other from time to time when it comes to A. Good balance of separate and together.<br /><br />It seems from what I've been told the 8 books in this series add up to one really long story so I will be interested to see where it goes from here. Sidenote: It's about a week after I finished this book (when I'm writing this) and I've read through 4, these are addicting!
B002T4GXSS|2.0|I purchased this DVD in March 2010 and was very disappointed to find out that during the crucial part of the movie you get a \\" INSERT DISC 2\\" message, well I thought it must be on the \\"KEEP CASE\\" but guess what?...

B0030BYWKK|5.0|It sounds like 1970, but with more harmony and less thudding, plodding bass and guitar.  These guys are Thoreau for the 21st century, writing about what it's like to live in nature, be awed by it, and try not to disturb it.  The first five songs just blow me away.  They're three plus minutes, but you want them to be seven or more.  Highly recommended
0525951113|2.0|I'm always one to finish a book, but I couldn't stand to read beyond the first few chapters. The book is written strictly by the numbers, it is cheesy and it has awful dialog. I couldn't keep reading after the drawn out, poorly written scene where a hardcore haxxor drugs up and has sex with a woman at a rave on camera, which is fed live to porn sites around the world. It's corny to the point of being self-skewering, but unfortunately it's not quite that smart of a book.
1433502410|3.0|Though it's more fun to read the New testament in Greek - and the Old Testament or Hebrew scriptures too, since the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible is what Jesus used and the early Church too (the LXX or Septuagint), I like to read in English as well. I suppose, over the years, I've preached most of my messages from the NIV, but I have spent time with the NEB (now the REB), the NRSV, the Good News Bible (I'm dating myself), the JB Phillips translation, The Message, yes, even the Elizabethan era's KJV. A number of people have been talking up the ESV, and since that translation is being widely used in the American South where I will be preaching in a little over a week, I decided to check it out.    Okay, let's cut to the quick. To my ears, the ESV has a stately cadence, religious and ceremonial. There is a slight stiffness to it, it does not flow like other English translations - there is a reason for that, its literal approach to translating from the Greek and Hebrew. I can live with this. Unfortunately, the translators have the annoying habit of tossing in words like BEHOLD and BE GONE and LEST and TRULY, I SAY TO YOU and O! O! O! Now why would they do this unless they had an express purpose of very obviously connecting with 1611? No one in the 21st century runs around saying BEHOLD or BE GONE or TRULY, I SAY TO YOU. They didn't in the 1st century either in Israel. But they did in Shakespeare's time.    I intend to read the whole translation and give it it's due. I will preach from it in the South as well. But I shudder that I might be treated to gems like STIFF-NECKED PEOPLE when I wander into the Old Testament. Already I was looking up Ezekiel 22:30 and instead of \\"stand in the gap\\" I got \\"stand in the breach\\"! Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more! Henry V, where chunks of this Bible belong.    Instead of BEHOLD why not say something real world like LOOK! Instead of TRULY, I SAY TO YOU why not say something comprehensible to this present generation such as LISTEN, I'M TELLING YOU or HONESTLY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU! The ESV seems fine for people that hang out in a church culture and like to use different grammar, syntax, vocabulary and voice when they're at a service - in other words, religious-ese or Christianese - but it's not great for helping newcomers understand you don't have to get all formal and religious in your language when you're worshiping or praying or talking about God.    With all the hype I was expecting something better than an anachronism but that is what the ESV is. Personally, the only way I can enjoy it - accepting its rather more ceremonial sound that echoes with the courts of King James and Elizabeth I and the stages of William Shakespeare - is to mentally drop those dreadful 400 year old prefixes like BEHOLD! and O! and BE GONE! - or verbally drop them if I'm reading out loud. If I do that, I can enjoy myself. Otherwise I'm happier in the Greek which is far more dynamic and contemporary than the ESV.    Look, there is no way this is a NEW translation. It's clearly in the KJV, ASV, RSV family line. And if you like that, have at her. I'm not here to say NAY to the ESV the way one of its editors, Wayne Grudem, said NAY to the TNIV (which, by the way, translates John 1:18 far better than the ESV). Only, please, don't tell new Christians they have to talk like the ESV in order to talk to God and please don't tell them words like BEHOLD and LEST and TRULY, I SAY are the way you talk when you get really spiritual. (And don't tell them it was the way Jesus talked on earth or the way angels talk now as if those frozen-in-time expressions are the real spiritual thing.) I was hoping we'd left all this behind or at least left it in the hands of the KJV worshipers.    The notes for the ESV Study Bible are quite good - they don't treat you like an imbecile and they have some good things to say, even some deep things to say that involve the original languages. And, as I said, though I'm more of a dynamic equivalency sort of guy, I can enjoy the more stately rhythms of the ESV within reason. But O! those jarring 17th century pet expressions. Why? Why on earth would you make a translation for the 21st century and deliberately put those back in? Go ahead, read the translation without them and you'll find you don't miss them, in fact, to my ear, dropping them vastly improves the translation and takes it from a 3.5 to a 4+    So enjoy it if it's your thing. But, to me, it leaves a lot to be desired, is not a big breakthrough translation and sounds a lot like other literal translations I read a long time ago when there were few other good contemporary English options out there. I'll read it, God will use it in my life, but I am waiting with even greater anticipation now for the 2011 NIV, which will give me something I can really celebrate (I hope) and which is tied into 2011 and beyond, not 1611 and ne'er another foot forward if we can help it, m'lord.    Sorry, Wayne. And Jim.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This box set features the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) in widescreen format, optimized for your 16x9 TV, and the picture looks great!  Of course, it's not Blu-Ray quality, but as far as DVDs go, it's fantastic.  The sound is crisp, clear, and lots of fun when piped through a surround system.<br /><br />George Lucas revisited the original films and added some new CGI effects that help achieve his original vision that because of technical and budget limitations were not available when he first made the movies.  The updates are minor, comprising less than 5 minutes of added footage, and don't change the overall look/feel/story.  Some fans love the updates, some don't like their Star Wars tampered with.  Whatever camp you're in, just be aware that the films presented here are the \\"updated\\" versions.<br /><br />The real treat of owning this box set is the documentary, \\"Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy\\".  Over two-and-a-half compelling hours, the viewer becomes aware of the sweat and tears George Lucas exuded in order to have his vision put on film.  In and of itself, it's an amazing story and one worth watching.  It will only increase your respect for this remarkable run of film making.  Then, one can really embrace their inner 12-year-old geek with \\"The Birth of the Lightsaber\\".  Awesome.<br /><br />In short, this box set comes highly recommended for Star Wars fans.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|They're back. And this time, they mean it. With this album Devo aims to set us straight on who's the boss in laying down ironic beats. Back in their heyday Devo proclaimed \\"It's a beautiful world we live in.\\" Today they shout \\"What we do is what we do. It's all the same, ain't nuthing new.\\" Both statements are the opposite of true. Several tracks on this album offer a whole lot of new. First, if you're buying the Standard (\\"Corporate\\") album, skip over Fresh. It's a Devo classic rave-up, with a wonderful stuttering chorus, but it sets the wrong tone for the newness to come. Start up with Step Up, a rocker with wicked swing. You haven't heard this from Devo before. Then continue with March On, a synth opus that could pop the tiles off the dance floor. After that, check out Human Rocket, another swinging rocker that mixes electronica with rockabilly, and offers lyrics that make you smile. After Human Rocket, just dig in. Some of the cuts sound (wonderfully) like old Devo on steroids (Don't Shoot... and the omnipresent Fresh). Mind Games is pure 80s power pop (also new for Devo) and perhaps we could have done without it. The biggest surprise -- and quite a departure for Devo -- is the gripping \\"There's No Place Like Home,\\" in which Devo frames the most devastating assessment ever of human stupidity in a satirically pretentious pseudo-Rush power ballad. It's $#!@ BRILLIANT. And Devo can play! At its best, classic Devo made you think. Sometimes it made you cringe. On this album, Devo makes you proud.

B003PWPGT0|1.0|I got to agree with one of the other bad reviews.  This album has a great lead off track with the great rockin' track \\"I Should Have Known It\\".  Other than that this album is VERY WEAK!  Sure fine music but VERY forgettable.  This album does not stand up to any previous Tom Petty album, IMO.  Not even close.  It is a huge let down and very disappointing from a big fan on this end.
B002ZG997M|5.0|The Book of Eli is not only the best post apocalyptic movie ever, it is one of the best movies in general I've seen. I would rate it up there with Fight Club, True Romance, V for Vendetta and Conan the Barbarian as one of my top 5 movies of all time. The acting in it was phenomenal. Denzel Washington gave the best performance of his career with this movie. What's even more interesting is after the big reveal at the end of the movie, if you watch it a second time, you see that he acted the part PERFECTLY and you'll kick yourself for not realizing it earlier. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who can handle a little violence and likes good movies.
B003FMTZOM|2.0|In all honesty, I have never been a huge fan of Christina Aguilera. I felt that she always took herself a little bit too seriously, especially when it came to her live performances and her 2006 album, Back To Basics. So when interviews began to surface revealing that her next album would be a fun, futuristic and experimental pop romp, I was intrigued. Now that I have actually listened to it, I am almost at a loss for words. This album is simply all over the place.     Some tracks truly do live up to her promise of a \\"bionic\\" album; however, the majority of the tracklisting is overwhelmingly occupied by very safe-- and even dated--song selections that immediately counteract any sort of advancement Aguilera achieved with the braver tracks. The aesthetic created collectively by the stellar and eclectic title track, the bouncy, M.I.A.-penned \\"Elastic Love,\\" \\"My Girls,\\" and--I suppose, if I'm being generous--the quirky, Sia-assisted ballad, \\"I Am,\\" is rudely interrupted by the curiously trite lead single, the R&B slow jam sleaze-fest pairing of \\"Morning Dessert (Intro)\\" and \\"Sex For Breakfast,\\" unnecessary, valueless interludes that should've been left on the cutting room floor, the obligatory Linda Perry ballad, \\"Lift Me Up,\\" and so on.     Also, Aguilera claimed Bionic would be far more playful than her previous effort, but unfortunately there are many moments here where she either takes herself too seriously--or not anywhere near seriously enough--as an artist. While I cannot deny the fact that \\"Woohoo\\" is a guilty pleasure of mine, it is impossible to ignore the overtly trashy lyrics and the complete absence of any cleverness to mute the utter obscenity of it all. The same applies to the awkwardly short \\"I Hate Boys,\\" which proclaims that the only thing men are good for are their \\"fruit, I mean, bananas,\\" and the final egotistical track \\"Vanity,\\" in which she claims herself as her \\"lawfully wedded b--ch\\" and closes with her young son deeming his mother \\"the queen ofthe throne,\\" presumably claiming to be the neo-Madonna, even though her attempt to recreate the spirit of Madge's 1990 track, \\"Vogue\\" via \\"Glam\\" was an absolute failure. These songs may become fodder for upcoming comedy routines and the new anthems for drag queens everywhere, respectively, but it seems their potential does not go anywhere beyond novelty. (Not to mention that her newfound potty-mouth, which thoroughly litters the album and rightfully earned it a parental advisory label, is laughable and comes out at all the wrong times.)     It seems even Ms. Aguilera may be in on the joke, so near the end she chugs through a chunk of misplaced ballads, as to say, \\"Look! I can sing and be introspective, too!\\" Well, they feel forced and, as expected, she over-sings throughout. (As mentioned before, the least offensive is \\"I Am.\\")     And as if this compilation of songs wasn't enough of a mixed bag, some of my favorite moments are buried in some of the least impressive songs. Christina's ad-libs near the end of \\"Woohoo\\" are powerful and mimic the production beautifully enough to make me forget about the unacceptable lyrics. \\"Desnudate\\" has some top-notch instrumentation in the last minute, if one can get past the embarrassing repetition of the \\"get naked\\" refrain and the unnecessary use of Spanish. And \\"Prima Donna,\\" with its boastful lyrics and grimy production, is standard pop & B fare, until the diva finally lays down some incredibly powerful vocals on the bridge. At the end of the day, Bionic is not a downright failure, but as a whole, it doesn't come close to an excellent--or even cohesive--effort.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Just saw it at the Little Theater in Rochester last night. The film is very good, just wish I could have found out more about the band members' personal lives, but they're very private. The film is a good introduction to the band but also a lot of fun for people like me who think they know all there is to know about the band. I found out a lot about how the band started that was new to me, and they had some very good quality footage of things like a teenaged Alex arguing with his parents over his decision to drop out of school and pursue music. I have no idea how this footage could exist unless there had been some kind of documentary made at that time dealing with an unknown Alex Lifeson's conflict with his parents over the direction of his life.

B002JCSWVG|4.0|INVICTUS<br /><br />STARRING: Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, Tony Kgoroge, Marguerite Wheatley, Patrick Mofokeng, Matt Stern, Julian Lewis Jones, Adjoa Andoh and Scott Eastwood<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Anthony Peckham; based on the book by John Carlin<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 11 December 2009<br /><br />There is something about African music that soothes my soul. It's so spiritual and overwhelmingly beautiful. Director Clint Eastwood's latest film Invictus embodies not only this amazing music, but other similar elements that will move you in indifferent manners.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman finds himself nominated for yet another Academy Award, for his flawless portrayal of the real life president of South Africa (and much more), Nelson Mandela. While I was glad to see Jeff Bridges finally take home his Oscar, Freeman was definitely a competing factor.<br /><br />The film essentially serves as two great film genres in one: the bio-pic, and the sports movie. It excels at both feats.<br /><br />After serving nearly three decades of his life sentence in prison for supposed `sabotage', Nelson Mandela is released and elected president of the very country that barred him from his freedoms. You wouldn't guess that Mandela was aware of this however, as he holds no grudge and wants nothing more than to give back to his country. The fact that this all actually happened, only makes us appreciate the film that much more.<br /><br />This is the early 90s, and although the apartheid has come to an end, racism's ugly head is still looming about. Mandela is desperate to evoke a change for his people. He finds comfort in learning that the world cup of Rugby, which only comes around every four years, is due its turn in history and South Africa has a slight chance of advancing forward with a shot at the main event. It's a very small chance, but Mandela seizes the moment in an effort to use this as an opportunity to unite his country.<br /><br />He befriends the captain of the team known as the Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). Being raised by ingnorant parents, Francois sees something in President Mandela that births the inspiration for a change in his life. Francoios further finds courage and faith in his team through Mandela, and fights with all he has to lead them to the world cup. With the odds stacked astronomically high against them, the Springboks will need the support of each other and their nation, to succeed.<br /><br />Invictus wasn't quite as good as some of Eastwood's other works, but when virtually every picture he directs are among the best ever made, it's not at all a discredit to him or the film. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are both sensational and this movie will at the very least inspire you to do good things in your life.nown as the Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon).

B00000J2SP|4.0|I believe that it's Ritchies attempt at safe \\"Van Halenesque\\" rock and roll at a time when that's where the wave was going.  However with respect to the everyone that says he abandoned his integrity for AOR it's just not true.  These are still good songs that have substance. They aren't songs that are, like every other song from that era , centered around the guitar solo.  I like Joe Lynn Turner. Get over the fact that he's not Ronnie Dio. He wasn't meant to be.   This is a different Rainbow. They're both good.   This incarnation has got a late 70's Bad Company / Foreigner type feel to it with a little bit more of a blues flair .  It's decent and worth having
B000QCS8TW|2.0|This book had so many gushing reviews that I decided to DL to my Kindle without even sampling. My bad, won't do that again.<br /><br />I think my biggest problem is the rampant paedophilia that weaves in and out of the plot. Honestly? I don't need to read about the wedding night (and ensuing pregnancy) of a 13 year old girl to some barbarian behemoth twice her size, didn't need repeated sex scenes between both of them afterwards (got the point the first time) and especially didn't need any more details about the \\"pillow tricks\\" the little girl gets taught. What did these add to the plot? Nothing. They didn't even influence or deepen the author's characterization, because neither character develops or grows or changes as the result of these encounters -- the barbarian is a standard undeveloped Barbarian With Decent Side and the girl basically learns to stand up to her brother (who, btw, has a fondness for pinching her nipples - but the \\"boob thing\\" in this book is a whole nother story). She's thirteen, gets sold to a barbarian horde, is raped nightly, and is apparently not remotely traumatized except that she gets a bit weepy during her introductory chapter. Yeah. Okay. She gets a pretty pony for her troubles though.<br /><br />Characterization in general was poor. There are a half-dozen (or more?) characters whose POV we delve into over the course of the book (tangent: this actually got very irritating; I'd barely get into one person's story before being teleported to x other location and having to start getting back into that person's story before POOF, moved again to some tertiary character's plot). None of the characters had a voice that could be remotely qualified as individual, except maybe the Imp's, but what characterized him was \\"I'm evil, except HUH, I'm not, because I keep doing noble things.\\" Not exactly stellar writing. The author also fails at writing children (maybe because he makes said children kill/copulate/witness a zillion deaths before they hit puberty, at which point they are basically treated by the author as short adults). One exception: Arya. I thought she was the most convincing of the young characters.<br /><br />The bastard children. Seriously, too many bastards -- the men in this book apparently have massive uncontrollable libidos & have to get it on with every comely wench that crosses their path. They have no need for Viagra in Standard Medieval Land (TM). The King alone must have six kinds of herpes.<br /><br />The direwolves. If the author was going to put so much importance on these creatures, I would have hoped that he would have researched what it's like to attempt to domesticate real wolves to at least lend a tinge of believability to that particular thread in his plot. I couldn't get over the dires being as obedient as triple grand champion border freakin' collies. Sit. Stay. Guard the door. Back off of that man whose mouth is currently in your throat. Write a dissertation on Paradise Lost. Okay.<br /><br />Now for some Kindle version grouches: the eBook edition is full of typos and badly OCR'd segments. You get random parentheses, dots, commas, etc., in the middle of sentences, as well as inexplicable italics on words that have no business being italicized. Words with two Rs in them frequently got digitized as having an \\"m\\" and vice versa. Those kinds of errors slap me straight out of the story.<br /><br />Now for what I liked: good fight scenes, and overall excellent world-building. I like the Black Whatevers living in the frozen Armpit of the World. Great plotting and effective use of the multiple POV perspectives to pull it all together (even if there were way too many characters). Too bad those multiple POVs weren't coloured by actually individual character voices. Wonderful political intrigues and a great set of support characters who were actually more interesting than the main characters (Littlefinger, and the Standard Effeminate Eunuch, for instance).<br /><br />I would not read this again and I wouldn't recommend buying it for the reasons outlined above. I rarely review but I want to share my thoughts on this, lest someone else comes along and is swept away by the buoyant tide of gushing that swept me along and right out of ten bucks and several evenings of reading.asons outlined above.

0062515675|1.0|First and foremost is I lost a little respect for Paulo Coelho for giving positive review for this book or is it a \\"Favor Bank\\" Credit? Mr. Paulo? (ref your book titled \\"The Zahir\\")    This book begins with the very mundane type description of the incidence which is so mundane that my 8 yrs old son will write it better (the court room scene) and then everything spirals downwards, If this book is sold  over 1 million copies I really am afraid that how many \\"stupids\\" are there in this world?    I am so disgusted with this book that I will not dare to write more about this book, I think that this is one of the worst book I have read in my life.    First five pages filled with the self praise!    I am born in India and staying in India for last 50 yrs, I have also stayed some years in USA and understanding the world as it is, (East v/s West) I doubt if anyone in his right mind will come to India for more then 3 weeks trip to see Taj Mahal and lots of such historical places, poverty at Mumbai, pollution of Ganges, and various experiments with Indian  food and festival at the most, but I really doubt India has anything more to teach to the westerners, so the book is entirely unbelievable and peace of crap.    Finally it is also full of plagiarism.  I can count many number of places where it is done but I don't think that I should waste more time on it.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|I have been waiting for Daria to come out on DVD since it went off the air. I was ecstatic when I read that years of waiting w  had finally paid off. However, the wonderful DVD set was tainted by the fact that MTV had no retained the rights to all the music in Daria. My main bone of contention is that the theme song is included in a small handful of episodes. Somehow, this small omission took away from the total experience. Otherwise, the episodes were exactly as I remembered them: bitingly sarcastic and something I could relate to.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Devo is back!  While it is not high art (like their excellent contemporaries Pere Ubu and The Residents), it is a fun, catchy synth-fest.  Make sure you pick up the 16-song deluxe version, as the four extras are all keepers.  Although none of the songs are as good as the high points of Freedom of Choice (Gates of Steel, Girl U Want, and Whip It), as a whole this album is better and much more consistent.  Duty Now For the Future, Spuds!
1590172213|4.0|This fantasy novel made a deep impression on me 20 years ago as an adult learning to savor current YA literature.  Set in England in the \\"present\\" this story involves the complex literary issues of time travel: the actual Vehicle, inevitable restrictions, the dangers of trying/or not trying to change the past. Farmer also includes such themes as sibling loyalty, sacrifice for friendship, surviving the loss of friendship, and insistence on one's true identity.     a new girl at a boarding school, Charlotte is surprised to receive words of advice from a kind, older girl, who ultimately turns out to be related to someone in her \\"other\\" past.  The Vehicle proves to be her own bed, for when Charlotte awakens the next day she finds herself in the same school but 40 years ago, during the terrors of World War I.  Even stranger than discovering that she is not Herself, she is accepted as someone named Clare by her peers and teachers.  Doesn't anyone know she is an unwilling imposter?  Ah--there is only young Emily, Clare's little sister, who suspects the truth, and becomes Charlotte's staunch ally in the past.     Each day Charlotte slips backward and forward in time, but doesn't anyone in the present realize her absence? How can she live in two  co-existing time continuums? With valiantly loyal Emily she conspires to untangle the truth; it seems that when Charlotte is in the Past, her doppelganger, Clare, takes her place in the present.  The only way the girls can communicate with each other about this metaphysical mystery is by leaving notes inside a hollow, twisted bedpost.     As in any time travel odyssey, there is always the danger of becoming trapped the past--the more so here, since Charlotte's rather timid personality permits her to be almost persuaded that she is not herself at all.  Is she willing to become a victim of this experience and remain as Emily's older sister? Is it wise to accept this odd twist of fate, to live out someone else's life or to surrender her own future to an unknown girl?    This proves a fascinating read, with serious literary challenges which keep the reader's mind guessing--eagerly trying to figure out reasonable explanations and logical resolutions of the temporal confusion. Farmer does a marvelous job of abiding by her own rules as three girls struggle to sort out their fate in war-torn England.  How can the protagonist retain her slipping grasp on the reality of her true identity, to live with pride as Charlotte--not just Sometimes--but Always? An excellent time travel fantasy for girls of all ages!

0307346617|5.0|This is a great story.  It's not humerous like the \\"Zombie Survival Guide.\\"  This book is almost scary.  The survival guide was more about the zombies themselves.  This book is about the humans and their reaction to the zombie infestation.  The scary part is how people react to the different situations.  Mr Brooks has a good understanding of the human condition and it comes out in this book.  It's completely different from any zombie story I have encountered.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I am really surprised with how amazingly great this album is. Most of the tracks are worthy of being singles and have a great beat that makes any activity fun. Even though I have played each some many times, I am still not tired of any of the music. This album blows her first one (which was really good) away and brings everything to a new level. Even her music videos are unique and fun to watch again and again! I really hope she maintains this incredible quality for her next album which we are all patiently waiting for!

B000006U44|5.0|Well I will say one thing for sure;there is no one who sounds quite like Kate Bush. Not now and not ever. While she has influenced the 90's generation of female singer-songwriters for sure there was (and still is) something very distinctive about her sound. During the 70's there was a group of artists emerging in the pop world whose musical had no definable label. I would count Joni Mitchell and Gino Vannelli among them. Often easy listening and jazz were places where they were pigeon holed into. All the same,during the time of her debut Kate Bush didn't even seem to fit in those places. While most 90's \\"alternative pop\\" was generally informed,lyrically and melodically by the complex angst of that time period Kate's focus in both respects can only be described as...a person in the throws of some type of romantically spirited revelry. The music on this album isn't recorded by a very large group. This album is mostly comprised of a series of piano based ballads anchored not only by the high,at times almost pixie like sopranno vocal style but a series of spacious reflections such as \\"Room For The Life\\" which speaks of the psychosensual complexities men and women seemed to (and often still do) put upon eachother for it's own sake. This and most of the other songs on this album such as the sweeping title song,\\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\",\\"Oh To Be In Love\\" and \\"Strange Phenomena\\" share a common sound that isn't exactly symphonic pop,isn't exactly jazz and isn't exactly folk but seems to be an embrace of the styles in between those if that makes any sense at all. There are a clutch of somewhat faster songs here which,while in keeping with her style fit more obviously into the arena of intricate jazz-pop such as the boyant \\"The Saxaphone Song\\",\\"Kite\\" and \\"James And The Cold Gun\\". Sometimes she even finds a middle ground between all of this in well arranged midtempo,poetic musical romances such as \\"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\\" and \\"Oh To Be In Love\\". It's interesting how in so many genres when the tempo stays in the middle and isn't too slow or fast there's often more room for expansive instrumentation and writing and that's exactly what happens on these songs. As her career marched along with a very steady stream of albums to come Kate Bush would only improve and expand on her work so this would happily not be the be all and end all of her creative energies. All the same,especially in this period you'd be hard pressed to find such a confident,fully realized debut album by most emerging artists.nd \\"Oh To Be In Love\\".

I have had to go to the authorities -- put it this way what the book addresses I feel in a different but similar way  I am dealing with here in NYC because I report on corruption.  Lisbeth would never go to the police for help.<br /><br />Once you get in to the book it is excellent.  It is not just a mystery but the book addresses muck raking, hate of all kinds, violence towards women, and of course there is murder -- actually serial killers so it is not pleasant reading but the 2 main characters make in almost digestible...almost.<br /><br />I am already on to the 2nd book and I can't wait to read the third book.

B002HREKCI|5.0|Right here is the reason why I chose this book. If you don't care to know, skip to the third paragraph:     A long time ago, a senior in my recommended this book for me, well, actually, that's a lie. She recommended it to my sister, so I asked her about it. My sister, the lovely person that she is, said, \\"It sounds stupid. I don't want to read a book about a girl killing herself. That's pathetic.\\"     Based on her reaction, which I found completely...void of emotion, I had to read this book. I'm glad I did.     Clay Jenson is a high school student. One day, he returns home to find a shoebox on his porch step, filled with cassettes. He decides to open it, and discovers that the tapes were recorded by Hannah Baker, a student who recently commited suicide at his school. A student who he cared about, but was too scared to admit it.     Hannah tells him, through the static of the cassette player, that he was one of the reasons why she killed herself. He goes through the town and listens and learns, one of the most important lessons of his life.     I adored this book, and I'm afraid my review won't live up to it, and won't convince you to read it. It makes you realize how the small things you do, and the small things you don't do, affect other people. Normally, I just get a story out of a book. I got a lot more out of this one, and I hope you will, too.       Another thing I'd like to mention is that, at the end of this book, there are blank pages. Front and back, thirteen. I know they're there for a reason. I'm going to pass this book on, and write on the first page what it gave to me. I'll urge every person then on to write it as well, so it's not just a piece of literature, but a lesson, like Jay Asher truly intended. I hope you'll do the same.

0743497465|4.0|With the exception of some short comings, I did really enjoy this novel. I think Dan Brown actually does a better job with female protagonists in general then male protagonists and Rachel Sexton here is yet another example of that. I think she is a great protagonist to our story, she is intelligent and a quick thinking and seeing a lot of the story through her works very well.<br /><br />I think overall, the science stuff works well in this novel. Sometimes, having a background in science and trying to read a thriller novel with a lot of \\"pusdo-scientific\\" references can sometimes conflict and get in the way of enjoying the novel, but in this case that does not occur. Brown stretches some science stuff here and there to make the story work, but none of it is bad enough to ruin the experience. And the story itself is well paced and fairly thrilling. There is a lot of action that starts to really pick up around the middle of the novel and carries on to the ending. Some of it is a bit outlandish and unbelievable, but for the most part it is fairly entertaining.<br /><br />Overall, this novel does just fall short of great, somewhere in the pretty good area. I think the combination of some overly-outlandish action sequences and the fact that the Rachel and Michael are a tad one-dimensional, and the surprise twists in the novel are a bit predicable. Nonetheless, the novel as a whole is pretty fun and entertaining.
B000CNE092|5.0|Ok,first of all, I'd like to start off by saying that before this film came out in 1997, I had little to no knowledge of Russian history or culture.  The only thing I knew about Russia was its figure skaters and that Russia used to be a communist nation.  I can remember after the movie was over thinking &#34;what a nice fairy tale.&#34;  I had absolutely no idea that Anastasia or the Romanovs were real people.  But after seeing the film and learning that Anastasia was a real person, and the story itself was LOOSELY based on historical events, I began to research Russian history and culture and have really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The film &#34;Anastasia&#34; while not historically accurate by a long shot, is still a great movie with breathtaking animation and a wonderful musical score.  I still can't get the song &#34;Once upon a December&#34; out of my head.  The DVD itself has a lot of very entertaining bonus features including: a making of featurette (I'm a sucker for those things), a &#34;Once upon a December&#34; sing-a-long, and Aaliyah's music video for &#34;Journey to the Past.&#34;  My favorite bonus feature is the tour of the imperial palace.  During the tour, you can click on objects in the palace and learn about that particular object as it pretains to Russian history, or culture.  The only thing that dissapointed me about the tour was that I would've liked to have seen more of the palace itself..but oh well.  And if you think that the Rasputin charater in the movie is creepy, you should reaseach the historical person, he's much creepier..trust me.<br /><br />This movie is well worth your time and money, enjoy!!

B000I3L2I8|5.0|This is probably my favorite Dan Brown novel. I think he overall creates a more interesting female protagonist compared to his novels with male protagonists. I really enjoyed Susan Fletcher's character a lot, and I really enjoyed reading her perspective on the story. I also liked the characters of Becker, Tankado, and Strathmore and how each of these characters developed in the novel. Granted some of the big \\"surprising\\" moments in the novel were easily seen coming, but they still made for an interesting story.<br /><br />I likes the subject matter of the plot, focusing on a lot of code-breaking and computers, while still grounding itself with Becker's action in the real world as a more average person compared to our other characters who found their strengths more in the digital world. I also really enjoyed the ending a lot, it was exciting and action packed and felt satisfying when it was over. Overall, the pacing of the novel was pretty good, this were consistently interesting and the story kept itself moving with very few dry moments.<br /><br />The only bad things I personally have to say about the novel, is that in the normal Dan Brown fashion, some of the time it almost seems illogical that our characters are so good at solving these remarkably difficult puzzles then get thrown off by some puzzle that feels trivial in comparison. Granted, this a tough balance to find, it still bothered me a bit. Also the end felt like it was supposed to be surprising, but was fairly predictable. However, none of these problems stopped me from really enjoying this novel.
B00132GBRA|5.0|You have to know that Merrell is good to begin with or you wouldn't be here.    Unfortunately, I could not find this boot in my size locally to try it on.  When I stuffed my foot in a regular (with hiking socks on) I hit the length I needed but just bound the sides of my feet.  I ordered these the same size, but in wide.  Going by most reviews I have seen that they are true to size, I took a shot.  Wellll, they are. The right boot is a touch larger than the left one is on my foot.  It's probably me--not the boots.      The Gore-tex at this price is a deal also.  I have similar boots in \\"waterproof\\" but that is too scary.  The waterproof boots my girlfriend has are genuinely that.  However, once the water gets in, they are still waterproof, lol.  Gore-Tex is the two-way street you need for boots.    The other thing about these boots is the genuine reviews (and hiker site tests) that these boots do not require break in.  Although the vendor I got them from drug his feet (no pun) getting them to me, I have still have about 10 days to get them ready.  I am looking forward to it.    Con:  And this is a general con for ALL boots these days except the $250-300 leather mountaineering boots.  Lack of a replaceable Vibram sole.  Hiking boots have turned into a disposable product like TVs.  Very unfortunate.

0545123275|5.0|I've had my eye on this book for a while, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to buy it. And I don't regret the decision. At first, I felt the book moved slowly, but by the end of it I realized that was part of the beauty of it. The love that developed between Grace and Sam felt incredibly real--despite the unrealistic circumstances. The effects of the book were subtle, but the core of it was quite profound. So much so that it struck a cord in me. It made an impact.     The storyline is simple, one we've seen many times. Supernatural/forbidden love. Foreboding. Doom. Miracle/united once again. But Maggie Stiefvater did an impressive job of making it her own. Giving it her own twist. The writing was, in my opinion, unique as well. The switching of perspectives was smooth, effortless. Clean transitions. It wasn't choppy or confusing. The characters were had depth and were sometimes even comical. Even the most minor character, to me, made an impression.     The relationship between Grace and Sam was even better. In some ways they are opposites, and in others they aren't. There was a few times while reading the book where I actually felt \\"these two don't work\\", but as their love got deeper and more... familiar, I realized they do actually work. What I loved about that was that it was real. Well, it felt real. Everyone is different, and yet, everyone in some ways are the same. And that's what this author conveyed so well.    I would recommened this book who appreciate that kind of detaling. Or to anyone who just wants a good read.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I love the storyline and the mysterious and egotistical character that is Jace. The book is very addicting to read and will want you craving for more. I finished it in less than a day! Praise for Cassandra Clare! READ it! BUY it! LOVE it!                                                        -Cecilia, 15 years old-
B000YPUF9W|4.0|Having now gained ever-increasing psionic abilities, Alice (Milla Jovavich) roams the apocalyptic, desert wasteland created by the Umbrella Corporation (UC).  Survival, that's it.  Nomadic in nature, Alice must \\"stay off the grid\\" to avoid the genetic testing being done by UC, who wish to harvest Alice's genes (think [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]]) in order to domesticate the zombies who have taken over.<br /><br />Part [[ASIN:6305075379 Mad Max]], part McCarthy's [[ASIN:B001OV2GRE The Road]], this version of Resident Evil is a bleak look at the final stage of humanity's end.  Despite the minimal philanthropic endeavors of the UC, there is nonetheless still a very evil feel about the corporation, particularly its head researcher Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen).  When Alice links up with a ragtag caravan of survivors from the Raccoon City incident whose intentions are set on Alaska, the plot is set.  Good versus evil, survivors versus zombies - with support from UC.<br /><br />The biggest problems I have with Resident Evil: Extinction - other than the fact that the zombie genre has been somewhat saturated recently - are the complete ineptitude of the UC and the ridiculous measures they used to protect their desert base.  First, the UC somehow can create these incredible underground fortresses, facilities so advanced they are unfathomable; manufacture the T-virus, a deadly infectious disease that has nearly eradicated humanity; and programmed a life-like, holographic image that can best deduce the options for humanity's survival; yet they can't find a single person, Alice, even though she is controllable via satellite?  Huh?  The other problem with this film is simply a major plot hole.  Numerous times throughout the depiction of the barren wasteland we are shown the top level of a facility (ostensibly the UC headquarters) that is nothing more than a few buildings surrounded by chain-link fences to keep the horde of zombies at bay.  Yet throughout the film we see the same zombies ripping cages and doors off of hinges.  Huh?<br /><br />Overall, however, the direction from Russell Mulcahy is crisp and David Johnson's cinematography is not necessarily unique, but nonetheless refreshing.  The writing from Paul W.S. Anderson is boring, loose, and predictable, but honestly, what else is expected from the third installment of a zombie flick?  The special effects, makeup, and action are the highlights of the film, as numerous supporting actors are nothing more than zombie fodder.  One of my favorite scenes - let's call it Hitchcock on steroids - displays all the merits of this film in one neatly wrapped package.  Overall a worthwhile effort, will be enjoyed by fans of horror or zombies.<br /><br />Jason Elins and doors off of hinges.  Huh?

B001KEHAI0|5.0|The movie is Fantastic and most people will agree on that with me.<br /><br />What I'm reviewing here is the quality of the BluRay, I'm totally happy about it.<br />I love the picture quality, great definition, deep blacks and almost zero noise for a 1995 movie.<br />The sound is also quite great!<br />A must-have!<br /><br />The director outdid himself, most actors even those who don't play big parts are very good ones.
B00027JYLC|5.0|I like this movie. It starts out just a little slow but it just keeps getting better.   I read where some people complained about the poor video quality. If you want a very good copy, buy the Warner Home Video copy and NOT the copy put out by Triad Productions Corp.   Warner Brothers always put out top quality copies.  (No, I do not work for Warner Brothers)
B00005Q45W|5.0|True the music is made on his computer in his LA garage studio but I loved every nuanced cigarette throat note .  Nothing beats the band but Leonard is a lyrical artist with with a license to create on whatever canvas he choses.  The album I have a hard time listening to is Dear Heather.  I figured out that most of Leonard's creations are inspired in kind of a misty muse of purple grenache melancholy...love it.
B003FK8V7G|4.0|This album didn't hit me as quickly as the 59 sound did. There are some really good songs on here, but some of the songs don't flow as well as they did on the 59 sound. Don't get me wrong the album is still very well written with Sprinsteen type songs throughout, but some of the power is missing at times.
B000A2IPP0|4.0|loved this movie when I was a child, now I got it for my children and they loved as much as I did!!
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is the most powerful movie I have watched about Civil War and the best production too,not only because of great battles it describes,but because of the great artists performance,the music,the locations and the people participation,like in a real war.God bless America!!!!
0765348276|2.0|It's tough to call this book anything other than a clumsy rewrite of Starship Troopers. The story arc more than resembles Heinlein's book. The same themes are there. However, Heinlein had a voice. He had a message to put across (as distasteful as it may be to some). I just don't see it in Scalzi's book.     I equated this book to someone as driving from point A to point B along the most direct path. No scenic turns what-so-ever. It just seems that so many interesting ideas are simply ignored. A few examples:    1. The characters, being 75+ years old, bring almost zero of this experience into their narrative.  2. The CDF (military force) simply acts as a supplier of machinery and bodies.  3. The 'Ghost Brigades' turn out to be simply clones of 'dead people' DNA. The 'people' of the Ghost Brigades are only a few years old, children in adult bodies, and this is just ignored. No moral outrage, no shock, etc.     So many missed opportunities for some real plot development, so many turns left unexplored. Each character, when confronted with some surprise, takes it in perfect stride - no shock, no moral asides, nothing. I couldn't even read between the lines of the characters - they seem like wooden responders to whatever situation they are put in.    All that said, the book is not a total waste of time. The aliens races are somewhat developed, the battles are interesting, and it doesn't sink to the dreck of series novels. But on the whole, I just can't recommend the book.
B002ZG99CM|3.0|Karate Kid was a touch-n-go experience for me. There were times when the movie was great and there were times where the movie didn't live up. There were times when I enjoyed the beauty of China and the quality of the film, and there were times when I wish they wouldn't have duplicated the original Karate Kid's script so much.<br /><br />There's is much to say about the new version of Karate Kid with Jackie Chan & Jaden Smith instead of Pat Morita & Ralph Macchio, and I'll try to cover it all in a short amount of time. First of all, taking the movie to China was a brilliant move. The culture in China was well captured and was, in my opinion, the 2nd best part of the film. Yet, the creators decided to stick to the original screenplay and many times to its own fault. In the original Karate Kid, Daniel was moved to California. Not such a big culture move. Most of his adapting to a new place was entirely a friend problem. In the new Karate Kid, Dre is moved from the States to CHINA. A huge culture move, yet since the creators decided to stick to the original script... we lose A LOT of the dilemma and overwhelmingness of a kid trying to make it in a place where he doesn't know the language & has to make friends.<br /><br />The decision of the creators to stick to the original screenplay was at times a disaster and at times, okay. It was never great. It was the few times where they used their creative liberties that took the film to better places. Like when Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) takes him to the top of the mountain to learn about true Kung Fu, or the festival where Dre steals his first kiss with Meiying.<br /><br />The best part of the film was the Karate. First of all, Jackie Chan is of course phenominal. He's a REAL karate artist, so that gave a legitamacy to the film that it possibly didn't deserve. Yet, Jaden Smith did very well himself and that made his scenes very believable. Of course, Chan's scene when he has to fight six of the teenagers who are ganging up on Dre, just like in the first film, was over the top awesome.<br /><br />There are many times when I found myself choked up and was leaning toward really really enjoying the film and giving it 4 stars until the final scene. The final scene is of course when The Karate Kid, Dre, in this case, makes his way through the ranks and does Mr. Han proud. Yet, the tournament seemed to go much faster in the new version, taking away from its realism as to how he made it to the finals. Also, the director decided to use an unsteady cam that shakes and zooms and twists while they fight, destroying the realism of the fights and sucking all the fun out of it. Finally, Dre's scene in the locker room while he pleads for Mr. Han to heal his leg so he can fight, didn't hold a candle to Morita/Macchio's scene. It was empty and had zero impact. Finally, the crane kick... is gone... in its place... quite simply.... something silly.<br /><br />Had the tournament had the same impact that the original had on people's hearts as they watched it, I probably would have given 4 stars. Then again. I knew what was coming. It was the same script as before. I wasn't surprised. My 9-year old daughter said as we left the theatre, \\"My heart was racing Dad.\\" So, for all I know, maybe the knew version will have a new impact on young kids of today as it did when I was a kid. Yet, I'm writing this review, and that's my 2 cents.film, was over the top awesome.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|Shame on those who reviewed before FOX released the plans for \\"Glee: Season 1, Volume 2 - The Road to Regionals.\\" Do not be deceived by the numerous 1 star reviews. Most are just ill-founded opinions about feeling forced into buying the first half of Season 1 again when, in actuality, they can order Volume 2 instead of \\"Glee: The Complete First Season.\\"<br /><br />So, in short, if you want to buy the complete Season 1, do it! Glee is an amazing show. If you only want the back 9 episodes, order \\"Glee: Season 1, Volume 2 - The Road to Regionals.\\" And finally, do not make critical reviews until all information is released. It negatively affects te sales of good products.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I don't really understand the negative reviews. Just because the band continues to innovate with their music, people act like its a bad thing. I have nothing but admiration for this album and have been listening to it non stop since its arrival. From start to finish, it evokes emotion and sets a mood. I can't pick a favorite track because this is really a whole album that deserves a start to finish listen.
B0035J6TAI|3.0|I bought this album, Scratch My Back, for one song - \\"The Book of Love\\".  I like it and two others, but even those two others are not great.  The rest of the album - well, just let me say that they would have been better with a different vocalist and leave it at that. Except for The Book of Love\\", I had never heard Peter Gabriel before; just a couple of his songs.  I think he would be better served to let someone else sign the songs. His voice is too raspy for me, and too unmelodic.
B001VZY4MS|3.0|I am sitting in a comfy chair about to embark upon my reviewing journey of the music of Neil Young. I have sorted the records and CDs into chronological order. I see in front me 10 of the former and 16 of the latter. I am not counting the DVDs or the Springfield or the CSNY recordings. Notwithstanding the foregoing I consider myself more of a casual fan, rather than a devoted one (I was a devoted fan, inter alia, of Del Shannon, Procol Harum and Steely Dan).  I mention the foregoing simply because it appears to me that for many artists the vast majority of the reviewers appear to be the diehards, people for whom the depositing of a bad review is positively painful!<br /><br />Neil Young is an earnest, yet hesitant beginning to Young's solo career. It is primarily a folk album, and as a lover of the genre, I have no problem with that. I think that side one is consistently stronger than the flip side. It contains the LP's best song, The Loner - definitely not a folk song. I find side two nice but innocuous.<br /><br />All-in-all I much preferred Young's contributions to the Buffalo Springfield albums. Other than The Loner there is nothing here to compare with Clancy, Flying on the Ground, Burned, Out of My Mind, Mr. Soul and Expecting to Fly. By the same token I think that the gentle folk approach found on this debut was more successful on the later Harvest and After the Goldrush.
0316789798|5.0|I bought this book in the 70's at a school book fair. It's one of those childhood items I've managed to keep. I ran across it recently while doing some spring cleaning. The cover is worn. There are some scribblings done by my younger sister. I also found some of my early experiments with four letter words.    My sister asked if I still had it, as my two year old niece has started her own scribbling. I'm sending her a new copy, and hope she will keep her copy as long as I've owned mine.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I will have to say I am left speechless in how AMAZING this DVD 2 disk set has me feeling. The detail in the yoga section makes it simple enough for a beginner \\"yoga\\" student to follow. The drills are fun and effective. I have used this twice now and will be doing the FULL workout drill and yoga tonight. I will not be able to share this dvd with anyone because I will be using it all the time, so go get your own and dive deep into the FUNTASTICAL world of RB
B001FB5634|4.0|This well-crafted movie is a very dismal and sad look at a futuristic world ashen and gray with little hope of anything better.  Viggo Mortensen is superb as the driven father and Cody McPherson (sp) is heartbreaking as the son.  Charlize Theron's brief role as the mother scores well too.  Adding to the doom is we don't even know what brought on the apocalyptic event.  Certainly a downer but quite well done.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie exposes a lot about what we eat everyday. This is so sad that corporations can do this with no concern for the very people that keep them in business. It's so important we know what is going into our bodies and our children's bodies, rather than trusting that the FDA is going to do the very job we pay them to do. And for what its worth the inhumane way these animals are being treated. EVERYONE needs to watch this movie!!!! PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE for your own safety.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria is not only the best animated show ever produced, it is one of the best shows period.    If you agree, even a little bit, with that statement then you'll be wanting these DVDs. The insert says that they differ from the original broadcasts in having some of the music replaced for license reasons. This might be true, but I did not find the change jarring and I would be hard pressed to point at any specific alterations. I have wached the entire series (minus the movies, which I already owned) and quite enjoyed the whole thing.    I can report that these are much higher quality than the illegal torrents which were your only choice as a Daria fan previously. They look good on my modern wide-screen LCD display.
031606792X|5.0|This is the first time in over 50 years of reading that I was absolutely spellbound!  I am addicted to the whole Twilight Series!  I have only read a couple 500 page books in my life and they took me over a month each.  I read all four of the Twilight series in one week each!  Amazing stories, gripping drama and dripping romance!  Wow, what a ride!  I even read the novela about Bree Tanner and loved it also.  Stephanie Meyer is a genius!  I hope she keeps writing in this area!
B0000062W7|5.0|EVERYTHING WAS GREAT REGARDING THIS TRANSACTION EXCEPT THAT THE PRODUCT WASN'T EDITED LIKE IT SAID. NOW THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION WAS THAT THE SELLER ACKNOWLEDGED FAULT AND PROVIDED ME A SPEEDY REFUND.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I was looking forward to reading the last book in the series. It was the first time I have ever read a book that was part of a series. I loved all of them. While I read the first one (which quite honestly I  didn't think I would like) I was hooked. I really liked the characters, ESP. Salander. I recommend the 3 books, you will be entertained. It's a shame that the author died after submitting the manuscripts for the 3 books.
B0035WTE2U|1.0|I'm 35 and was sick of AC/DC 20 years ago.  Overplayed like crazy on any radio station this side of the moon.  THIS is the best they can come up with for one of the best super heroes of all time?  What's next?  An all Aerosmith Iron Man 3 (or Avengers) soundtrack?    I guess I'll save this money for the Blu-ray version of the movie.
0345409671|4.0|This was an interesting book, though perhaps not as entertaining as some of the others in the series.  It was different and it was thoughtfully done.  Was happy to find Lestat again.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'\\"
B001EOQWF8|2.0|The most compelling scenes in this movie are towards the end when we see how humans turn out when divorced from nature.  In one scene, a captain becomes completely fascinated seeing a living plant and in another, a man and woman accidentally touch each other and are shocked by the feel of human skin.   As for the rest of the movie, I found myself getting quite bored, especially since the world Wall-E inhabited was visually uninteresting.  Wall-E does eventually get a love interest, but I didn't understand why humans would give a robot any emotions at all.  How would doing so serve humans?  Overall, it had a good environmental message, albeit delivered too heavy-handedly at times, but it was too slow moving to hold my interest.
B0000042MY|5.0|Saw the movie several years ago.  The soundtrack is as I had remembered it.  Relaxing music.
B0032JTV74|5.0|Love, love, love this show and I truly can't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray! I'm glad I waited to buy the episodes and am able to avoid all the drama about the Vol 1 - Vol 2 DVD. I do plan on pre-ordering this set, but not from Amazon. $62.99 is just a little steep for 4 discs. Walmart has the Blu-Ray available for pre-order at $48.96. I usually prefer to order from Amazon, but I can't ignore the price difference. Just thought I'd say this info with my other Gleeks!
0307454541|4.0|I love mysteries and thrillers so I picked this up  six months ago because of all the hype surrounding it. It wasn't what I expected. There are plenty of reviews which will give you a synopsis so I'll skip that. The strange thing is I actually enjoyed this little story about a guy who takes on this missing persons investigation. And I can't figure out why. Despite what I've read from some of the reviews there's not a lot of violence or sex in the book (there are some parts but they make up a small minority) and I think the gratuity functions too create a feeling of disgust in the reader. The sexually depraved characters are the ones you're supposed to dislike and you dislike them because of their sexual depravity so I think it's necessary. But aside from that, for some reason I felt myself being pulled into this book and wanting to know what had happened in this Vanger family. It really does draw you in and I can see why this was an international bestseller.  It is by no means the best book I've read (even this year) but it's definitely worth a read.
006088732X|5.0|If you hated the show, do not turn your nose up at this book. It is an amazing read! If you like the TV show, thats good, but it doesn't do justice to the book at all. I read this book last year and regret not buying it then!
B002ZG977Y|2.0|I saw the orignal Clash of the Titans when I was very little, and even back then, I knew I wanted more. When I grew up a bit, like say, in middle school, I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted a remake of the film that was so cheesy and yet so lovable. Sooo more than a decade later, I finally got my wish-or not.     The remake of Clash is appallingly bad, and not in a cheesy way. It is just bad. Everything about it is worthless. The characters are pointless and have no redeaming qualities, the Gods are completely underutalized. The plot is non-existant and really doesn't make any sense. Andromeda may as well have been written out of the script since her appearance in the film had NO purpose. The CGI is OK but man do I wish for the old Medusa. The list goes on and on. The acting is the only saving grace here. And I'm pretty much talking about Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson. They commanded the screen in their small, pointless roles. Sam Worthington does a good job, but nobody CARES about his character. He comes off as arrogant and unworthy of anything.     There is no soul to this film. It is just bits of action scenes sewn together for entertainment purposes. I was so frustrated and aggravated after the ending because after literally years of hoping and waiting, the final outcome is just plain garbage. Perhaps my expectations were too high but maybe if the creators spent more time on the actual plot and less on trying to make this film 3D, then just maybe it would have turned out decent. Or maybe not.
2839906171|5.0|I am at a loss of words for this book. Alex & Co have done a fantastic job of explaning business models with real life examples. I have actually used this in my role and also joined their website to get updates from them. Couple this with the 'Blue Ocean Strategy' and you dont need any other materials to analyze business models and use them. The books is slightly tilted towards the internet economy, but that said, it is exhaustive and give examples in other industries as well. I am awating a second edition of this!
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Shutter Island is a very ambiguous film. I knew exactly what direction it was going in about halfway through it, and yet, after the credits rolled, my mind was a jumble trying to decipher what I just watched. In my opinion, I don't think the ending was as crystal clear as the film would like you to believe. The 'Is Teddy sane or insane?' arguments are abundant on the internet. The movie would like you to believe that he is indeed, insane and there is proof from the very beginning. However, one can counter that for all the evidence, it can still very easily be twisted so that the other argument wins out. It is not as dry cut as it appears, or as they state. This movie desperately needs multiple viewings.     In my mind, the final truth that confirmed the 'sane' argument was that final haunting shot of the lighthouse. The people that saw this film know what I am talking about. There are so many theories going around and I honestly think the whole point of this film is to make people crazy trying to figure everything out.     Many people who don't like Shutter Island call it a cop-out and a huge 'gocha!' joke. I can see how that would frustrate someone-that is, if you believe the 'insane' argument. This can go back and forth. I havent seen a movie like this in ages, where you go back in your mind days after watching it and still try to reason things out.     The performances are top-notch and the cinematography is just stunning. The colors are bold in a non-colorful way, but they stand out nonetheless. The imagery and lighting really sets the tone and I actually loved the over-the-top musical score. It almost made it seem like you were in the middle of a horror film, which this is not. But it still fits so perfectly because it really is the ideal way to set the scene, especially when it revolves around a creepy mental asylum.     Truly, I would go into this film knowing as little about it as possible and allow the suspense and mystery to overtake you.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Very good film and story.  We did have trouble with it playing on a blu-ray player bit it worked fine on our regular player.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|Deny the naysayer. I think this is a very, very good piece of work. Took a few plays to sink in but it's now my current favorite.
B002E2M5IC|3.0|The title gives It away. This is a very serious movie. Was it supposed to be funny? Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski were funny. I tried to laugh with this one, but found nothing to even smile at.<br />If you want Jewish humor, watch a Woody Allen movie, many of which are laugh out loud funny. Sleeper, Love and Death and Annie Hall are hilarious. This one, not so much. Go figure.

Although full of technical innovation and revolutionary for its time, its unshakable position as the `greatest movie of all time' cannot be attributed solely to the technical genius of Orson Welles. His use of special effects was inventive, and showed clear influence from Welles' experience as a magician. In addition to its use of special effects, Citizen Kane was also groundbreaking for its addition of meaning to existing cinematic and editing techniques.] author Alvin Lin    [...]
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Not having seen (or having a whole lot of interest in) the 1988 version, this musical wasn't on my list of 'must-see's', for sure. Teenage angst and protests for racial equality? John Travolta, in a fat suit, doing a duet with ever-offbeat Christopher Walken? Didn't ring any bells. But for whatever reason, kids, I rented it....fully expecting to let it play while I went around getting laundry done or doing monthly bills. By the end of the first scene (and musical number, \\"Good Morning, Baltimore\\") I was completely hooked.  If you like \\"Grease\\", you'll like this, guaranteed. The songs are every bit as catchy, and were written specifically for this show--I dare you not to be humming at least one of them for a week.  The cast is completely in tune with the fast-paced but well-edited proceedings: heavyweights Travolta (pun intended), Pfeiffer, Walken and Latifah, troupers all, are not above going up and over the top to get laughs---and they do. The young supporting players are terrific, and there are some knockout dancers among them--notably Elijah Kelley as Seaweed. My only complaint is that the versatile Amanda Bynes hasn't a lot to do in her best-friend role, but she makes the most of what she has, with her ingratiating personality. One of the best things about this production is the discovery of the charming Nikki Blonsky, an unknown, to play the unconventional leading lady. She'll grab your heart in the first ten minutes. Were I in high school back then, I would have asked her to the prom-----though with my luck I'd probably have ended up with Carrie.  This is an absolute must-see if you truly enjoy \\"feel-good\\" movies.  You will undoubtedly feel good. Hat's off to director Adam Shankman, and everyone who put this together.
0517548232|5.0|The lesson: \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"    In other words, fallacious economic policies almost always seek to benefit one group at the expense of all others, or to bring about short-term benefits at the expense of long-term benefits. Using clear prose and compelling logic, Hazlitt explains how \\"the lesson\\" is applied to various scenarios such as division of labor, savings, credit, minimum wage laws, and tariffs. Though this book was written over 50 years ago, the issues the book cover are just as relevant if not more today.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|2010's remake of 1984's \\"Karate Kid\\" has been titled different in different countries. Director Harald Zwart's film was called `The Kung Fu Kid\\" in China, \\"The Best Kid\\" in Japan and South Korea while U.S. audiences are stuck to the original film's title \\"The Karate Kid\\". My first complaint with the film's title is that why call a film \\"Karate Kid\\" when it is clearly about a teen who learns Kung Fu and yet it is called \\"Karate Kid\\"; I thought this was the usual Hollywood garbage and it would be a slap in the face of the Chinese martial arts since the title is so misleading. Chinese Kung Fu is filled with circular movements that are derived from the movements of animals. Japan's Karate is a more linear art that is meant to finish an opponent with one blow, and to fight numerous opponents. Yet, with Jackie Chan in a the role of Pat Morita, I had hope that the film would give respect to the Chinese martial art and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This film is not related to the DC comics character with the same name. The film's association with 1984's original \\"Karate Kid\\" is the mere fact that it captures the same premise, same key plot sequences but it has different characters and a different backdrop (this time the film takes place in China). I would say that it is not a remake but more of a re-issue; and thanks to Jackie Chan, he makes the film very credible in a dramatic role. (Yes, in Asia, Chan isn't just known for his action-comedies, he is a well-respected singer and dramatic actor)<br /><br />11-year old Dre (Jaden Smith) and his mom (Taraji Parker) locates to China because of the demands of her job. A stranger in a foreign land, and without friends, Dre becomes fond of a sweet Chinese girl named Mei Ying (Wen Wen Han) but this infatuation leads to him being bullied by a young practitioner of Kung Fu named Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). The situation escalates and Dre ends up being defended by Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), the maintenance man in their place of dwelling who is also a kung fu master. Han advises that Dre needs to settle things with Cheng through his sensei, Master Li (Rongguang Yu) but the two soon discovers that he is every bit as hard headed and arrogant as Cheng. Forced to barter to be allowed to leave without incident, Han agrees to the stipulation that Dre will fight Cheng and his whole gang one-on-one in a Kung Fu tournament. Dre only has little over a month to train under Mr. Han; student must learn from the teacher as the teacher also becomes the student. The two begin to form a strange bond as they meet their antagonists head on to defend their honor...<br /><br />The charm of the original was the fact that Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) was just so charismatic as the Karate master. Chan matches Morita's charm in every way possible and proves to be quite convincing as the aging Kung Fu master. Instead of the wax on, wax off, paint the fence and sand the floor type of thing, Mr. Han opts to have Dre train by taking off his jacket, hanging it, putting it on, dropping it, and then hanging it again. It does make a good transition in the script seeing as Dre is a slob and is always leaving his jacket on the floor. Martial arts is a way of life after all, and a practitioner of the art embraces its philosophy as well as its movements; it becomes a way of life. The film does manage to establish a credible relationship between the two and Mr. Han as with Mr. Miyagi in the original also had his demons to face.<br /><br />I guess what the original had that this remake didn't was the fact that it was realistic. Daniel (the original character) was a weakling and didn't have the savvy to become a very capable fighter in month. Miyagi gave him the tools he needed to face his tormentors; Daniel could never become a warrior, but he had the quality moves and heart to win over his opponents. This time around, this remake takes a little cartoonish route, as Dre becomes a capable fighter in a month; displaying the skills and movements that equal his opponents who had been practicing the art for a lot longer time; Dre didn't feel like an underdog but rather a competitor with equal skill--in a month.  I had a hard time buying into this, I cannot believe that a student who had no exposure to Kung Fu can pull off a final move that he observed but never really taught. Daniel was a better character than Dre. The supporting characters are also a little cartoonish. Dre's mother does have more screen time and develops a relationship with Han which was good. I also liked the fact that the script settles for a theme of friendship between Dre and Mei, rather than the teen love between Daniel and Ali. This was a good change, as the film also pays respect to Chinese culture. The relationship between Han and Dre was developed well, but then, with Jackie Chan, it is easy to have an attachment to his character. However, Smith wasn't totally convincing and he felt a little too whiny; I can forgive this since he is only 11 years old in the film.<br /><br />The fights were nicely executed and I was impressed with the quality of the choreography. Cheng and the other young Chinese fighters were real convincing in pulling off those complex moves. The hits looked like they were actually making contact and the camera work was kept tight with some flashy use of slow motion and clever editing. There were some wire fu included in the fights, but they weren't that obvious; Chan and company did their work well. Oh, as with the Daniel's Crane Kick, Dre develops his own signature move; and it was very cool. The cinematography was stellar as the viewer becomes privy to the slums of the country as well as its beauty. The scene when Han and Dre traveled to the temple atop the mountaintop was breathtaking, and there is a very cool scene with a mysterious woman (a Michelle Yeoh look-alike) who entrances a cobra.<br /><br />So the question remains: Is this film a worthy remake? Well, it is, as it does pay homage to the original and a lot of the key scenes was more or less a tribute. This does render the film a little too predictable so those who loved the original will find this remake very unnecessary. I am one of those people, but despite its flaws, I have to admit the film was very entertaining that it did establish the differences between the Chinese art to the Japanese art, as well as paying reverence to both martial arts systems. The film does make it clear: \\"It's not karate\\". It does have a lesson to share, while it is not as memorable as the original; it was still quite germane in today's times.<br /><br />Recommended Timidly.

B0002EXH54|4.0|Peace sells is one of the best metal songs ever! I'd buy this just for that song.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I saw the movie before I read the books, and was sorely disappointed. They could have done so much more with the character development, and frankly, I found this movie boring. It did not have the teamwork/camaraderie that other movies do, and the special effects were only so-so. It was over-hyped, rushed, and under-developed.
B00001X590|3.0|With only two songs that are enjoyable I wish I downloaded instead. Live and learn.
B001FB55I0|5.0|i love this movie in the teather, but in blue ray is more detailed and with an excelent sound you will centanly enjoy
B002XTBE8I|4.0|One of or THE best rapper(s) of all time, at least one of the best artists in the past 10 years.     A Few tracks stand out, but it's obvious this is NOT his best work.     Regardless, I will support him in everything he does, if you were to pick 1 CD not to buy of Em; this is it.     Good overall, but lacking his origanal awesomeness.
B0010X745K|3.0|This movie could have been a lot better or more suspenseful. Some of the CGI gets cheesy which makes it lose points in my book. The crazy christain lady was overtly annoying in my opinion and could've been handled in a darker tone to fit the movie better instead of the parody it was. One of the only saving qualitites was the ending which was excellent. If the entire movie would have that dark of a tone then this movie would have been awesome.
1849162743|5.0|My book arrived earlier than expected.  I didn't know how long it would take since it was coming by mail from Ireland.  It took right at a week.  This paperback actually arrived the day before the hardback came out here in the US.  Who knew?  The used book looked and felt brand new.  No marks, no bent pages.  Excellent condition.  I actually received a personal email - not the automatic computer kind - from the owner of the bookstore.  Very personable and nice.  He asked me to be sure to comment on my purchase.  I was very pleased.
B000W7205O|2.0|Was looking forward to getting a 'newer' version of the so-called extended cut (supposedly 102 minutes) but instead got the 'old' 2002 DVD-5 version instead. Video and audio are crummy as all get out. Was hoping this brown covered version is a newer pressing and possibly dual-layered. The red cover version I got is the exact US version running 96 minutes! The cover looks to have been sloppy-made by a kid on a computer...hopefully when buying this you make sure you don't get the red cover version. Don't get ripped off like I did. Hopefully someone will leave a review of the brown cover version (with booklet) and let us know if it's a good transfer or not. Cheers!
0071373586|4.0|After finishing this book I tried to think of how I can get some results from the author's insights. I think it's best implemented from the ground up for most people. Most of us don't have the position, power or energy to change a whole organizations positioning but you certainly can change your own positioning and your career path's too. Look to change from the client's point of view, not your own. That was a very interesting concept. Of course, you need to have a great plan on getting your client's POV in the first place in order to position yourself. In summary, the book has many great examples of what to do and what not to do and my conclusion was to work on myself first.
B0036V4DGC|5.0|Even though the video quality is not up to today's standards (it's 1.33 with 2 channel stereo)it beats the heck out of nothing! It's Alan Parsons live, man!! Something I thought I would NEVER see on video! Maybe because I'm a fan...I'm easier on the review. But, man...IT'S ALAN PARSONS LIVE!!! Good concert, waaay to short (at 80 minutes) but better than nothin' at all. Enjoy it for what it's worth. Hey, it's not Blu-Ray...it will definately do!!! If you're a fan, get this German all region import DVD before it's out of print.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|what more could you ask for in an album?!   the songs are each so dynamic, and the range of songs is complete but overall it's just so feel good, just FUN.   i'm a long-standing hanson fan but it's irrelevant, hanson appeals to anybody, whilst at the same time being so different to any other artist out right now.   The song on loop whilst i go to sleep at the moment is Me, Myself and I.
0143038583|3.0|To be fair, I've only made it through 1/2 the book so far.  (I read books while on vacation.)  I can say the first half of this book goes into extreme detail explaining how all of the USA has been distorted by Govt subsidies of corn, with the result that America is overweight, farming communities are disappearing, farm land is being destroyed, and farmers are losing money.  So far the book is a treatise showing how the artificially low price of corn is destroying America top to bottom - because it is so cheap corn is now used to make most everything we eat (to our detriment).    The book is an eye-opener and shows why we need to change Govt farm policies (which aren't good for anyone outside of some big corporations).  If the book was fun to read I would have given it 4 stars.  If the book told me how to avoid being victimized by farm policies I would have given it 4 stars (maybe that is in the 2nd half).
0307454541|4.0|I don't read a great number of thrillers so I can't compare this to other thrillers written by Patterson, Coben, etc.  But I know what I like and I liked this book.  Despite what some of the reviewers think this book is not difficult to read at all.  There are not hundreds of characters and the violence is not that bad at all.  If you want to read graphic violence try The Painted Bird or Steps by Jerzy Kosinski.  The violence in those two books makes \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" read like Dr. Seuss.  This is a great book to take to the beach.  You will be finished with it in a 3 days or so.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|Having never watched this series on TV, I was pleasantly surprised at what a terrific show it is. Great characters, complex relationships between the brothers and their dad, an interesting story with original villains and some unexpected twists. Anyone who enjoys science fiction, should enjoy this.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Let me state right off, that I'm a huge fan of this show and I loved season one.  I really was not sure how the writers would top season one, but they nearly pulled it off.  This season is a roller coaster, with unexpected turns and plunges.  Keith Carradine is a great addition to the cast and his relationship with one of the lead actors (spoiler alert: it's not Dexter) is touching and surprisingly hot.  They're some real shocks in this season and some stunning developements.  I dont want to give away too much, so let me just say that if you loved season one of this fantastic series, you won't be disappointed in Season Two, if fact you may actually like it better.
0156027321|5.0|The story you start reading is not the story you finish reading.<br /><br />Part biology, part theology, and part psychology, this amazing little novel provides new perspectives with every chapter.<br />It could be an allegory for the challenges of religious belief.<br />It could be a survival adventure, based in zoology.<br />It could be an account of how a young boy deals with trauma too deep for him to comprehend.<br /><br />You'll probably change your mind several times before you close the book.
6305609705|5.0|Great video for the price.  The seller was very professional and provided rapid shipping for the item.  Would recommend the sell to anyone seeking used videos.  Quality of the video was excellent as seller stated in ad.  Keep up the good work.
1589944607|5.0|This game is awesome, but it definitely requires the Pegasus Expansion for extra drama.  I love the show to pieces, and if you haven't seen it, I recommend trying to watch it first - otherwise the board game might spoil you for the first two seasons - but as long as you enjoy board games, you don't have to love the show to love this game (I promise, I have played with many a non-fan).

0316017922|5.0|In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell suggests various, outlying reasons people experience success.  Unique backgrounds and experiences of geniuses, business tycoons, rock stars, athletes, software programmers, and more are explored in a way that keeps the reader curiously engaged throughout!  The secrets are revealed!    The author opens with a story revealing the secrets of health in one unique community of Pennsylvanians who, remarkably, rarely suffered from heart disease.  After a thorough investigation of the entire population, \\"virtually no one under fifty-five had died of a heart attack or showed any signs of heart disease.\\"  Heart attacks were an epidemic in the US at the time, yet the members of this community smoked heavily, consumed 41% fat calories, and struggled with obesity, with virtually no heart problems.      \\"There was no suicide, no alcoholism, no drug addiction, and very little crime.  They didn't have anyone on welfare.\\"  Neither were there any peptic ulcers.  \\"These people were dying of old age.  That's it!\\"    The secret!  The strength of a supportive social culture, transplanted from southern Italy and protected from the pressures of the modern world.  Findings reported to the medical community included the mysterious and magical benefits of people stopping to talk to one another on the street and of having three generations under one roof.  A charming community where:  Women worked in blouse mills.  Men worked in slate quarries.  People walked up and down the streets, stopping to visit with one another on their porches.      Gladwell achieves his goal of defining \\"circumstances\\" that facilitate success just as the above \\"circumstances\\" facilitate health.  Fascinating accounts of people's hidden advantages, , extraordinary opportunities, and cultural legacies make it quite impossible to put this book down.      The author suggests that \\"Success is the result of what sociologists like to call \\"accumulative advantage.\\"  He shares unique circumstancesand compulsory preparation leading to the success of hockey players, students, composers, fiction writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and more.  The peculiar secrets of the skilled, the talented, and the driven are revealed . . . including those of Bill Joy, Bill Gates, the Beatles, Steve Jobs, and more.  It's a quick, engaging read!

This old fool really enjoyed this light-hearted, good-hearted culture clash.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|PLEASE stop posting negative (low star) reviews referencing the purchase method. Instead, rate the SHOW instead.    For those that are upset and posting negatively against GLEE due to this being a Full Season DVD Set.. Guess what.. Some of us researched and knew how the release was going to happen at the END of the season and DO want to purchase the Full Set. There IS another purchase option for those that already purchased the first part of Season 1 earlier!!! Check out \\"Glee: Season One, Vol. 2 - Road to Regionals\\". See? We can ALL be happy!    Now on to the show itself.. WOW! What an amazing first season! GLEE is so much more than a \\"one-trick pony\\". It's full of comedy, drama, issues, musical entertainment.. We have laughed and cried, usually in the same episodes! It has been amazing to watch from start to finish and see the characters emerge and grow. This is one of those shows that I can watch a single episode over and over in a row, as I love to sing along. At the end of the season, we aren't left considering what can they pull out of their hats for next season.. we are left excited over the amazing number of possibilities left to explore.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Pretty Woman is my favorite movie and I thought I almost knew it by heart. What a surprise when there were two additional scenes in this video that I had never seen.

B003E48AYC|5.0|I went to see Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland the day it opened in theaters. I'm a fan of Burton films and I waited a long time to see this film. I wasn't dissapointed. The visuals are gorgeous and really creative, Wonderland is in one word \\"fantastic\\", the characters blend effortessly in the Wonderland scenery (sorry Underland). The plot is predictable but the performances of the characters make this a truly engaging experience. Johhny Depp is fantastic as the Mad Hatter as is Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. Crispin Glover also was good as the Knave of Hearts. The vocal performances for the animated characters are top-notch (especially Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar (Absolem) and Stephen Fry as the Chesire Cat). Mia Wasikowska gave an excellent first impression in the title role. As conclusion, Disney and Burton delivered an imaginative, visually stunning, well performed film.<br /><br />The Bluray/DVD/Digital Copy combo is excellent. The picture looks stunning in Bluray and Wonderland is gorgeus. The sound is equally impressive. An excellent transfer. The DVD, loses some of the richness in hi def but nonetheless is an excellent transfer for SD. The extras are a little short in time but they will entertain you. An excellent combo for a nice film.

0307454541|1.0|I have been searching for an engrossing series to get lost in this summer. I was really excited when I picked up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo because of the positive praise I have heard for this book and the other two in the series. It started off pretty slow. However, as the mystery developed a bit I was interested! I couldn't wait to find out what really happened and flew through most of the book. Now, after finding out I wish I had avoided this altogether. This book is really sick and demented. Mind you, I was busy rewatching and loving Dexter while reading this. I am not turned off by anything that is dark usually. However, when all was said and done, this book left me feeling queasy and sad. Violence against women is an important issue and should not be brushed under the rug but this was exploitative of that issue. I wish I had never read this book. Further, I can't understand all the praise. I find that to be the most disturbing part. Really? This many people truly enjoyed reading about rape, incest, and torture? The writing is not particularly amazing either. I just don't really see any redeeming qualities about this book other than that the build up was interesting. If I could go back, I would have skipped this one.

B003A9FMX8|5.0|I bought this content for the cuts that I was already aware that I knew and liked, but had never owned - even back in the day - although, I believe that's mostly because, as I recall, these songs were so frequent on the airwaves, (and for so long) in those days, it was likely that it was as though that in itself may have sufficed, to me, for not having the money to buy the record at the time, as I also seem to recall, that as a high-school student living in the days of the golden age of rock, I had 'ears far bigger than my wallet' pretty much all the time. I bought this CD edition because, over the intervening years, I have gradually acquired (by my own standards, anyway) a fairly nice HiFi and wanted to hear what this version had to offer, especially since I could find no reviews - even though stocks of it seemed to be dwindling only DAYS after its initial release. I figured I might better pull the trigger before the price went up (on the used market, Amazon sellers, ebay, etc.), assuming there would ultimately be no 'second wave' of supplies of it to hit the internet shelves. But, I figured I'd try it and see, despite its being rather pricey.<br /><br />As for the content, the music is great! I wound up with 6 established favorites from this disc: \\"Rhiannon\\", \\"Over My Head\\", \\"Say You Love Me\\", \\"Landslide\\", \\"World Turning\\" and \\"Jam #2\\". The rest of the album proper is not bad, either. And there's also the single versions of \\"Say You Love Me\\", \\"Rhiannon\\", \\"Over My Head\\" and \\"Blue Letter\\". I found the album versions of these tracks to all be ultimately prefferable to the singles, but you won't hear me complain at all about being given a choice. \\"World Turning\\" proved to be a track that, prior to hearing it on this CD, I honestly can't recall when I heard it last, it's been so long, yet I recognized the tune, as long-lost from my conscious memory as it was, within the first, few seconds and then suddenly realized that I had never successfully placed it as actually being a Fleetwood Mac tune - a pleasant surprise for me. A treasure recovered. This track, all except for its driving, tribal-rhythm coda (think: a spark for the bon-fire that \\"Tusk\\" would later become), has a classic feel that almost plays like some sort of long-lost Zepplin jam, and that's not a bad thing at all, actually. And then, of course, there's the much-hearalded and sublime \\"Landslide\\" that must simply be one of the most heartfelt and deeply stirring songs of any rock decade.<br /><br />As for the 2010 CD edition, this is a Japanese import (with obi strip - part of the \\"Forever Young\\" series). They have apparently used the previous 2004 remaster artwork as the template, so, I'm also presuming this CD is pressed from the 2004 remaster as well (though I can't prove that in a court of law). The CD does not list the technology used for the remastering (DSD, Bluray, SHM, 24-Bit, etc.), unless it's in the Japanese text (which is all Greek to me). If I had in my possession (or could even recollect any impression of, for that matter) the 2004 remaster, I could better tell you wheather this more priceyer version was worth the extra cash or not, but, I've never listened to it. As for the sound quality on its own, I can pretty much tell you: there just isn't much to criticize, here. This seems to me to be a surprisingly good edition of a 1975 recording, I can at least tell you that. No sonic performance area seemed suspect at all and the recording itself seemed to have a nice live quality to it that helped to treat me to the illusion of the group performing in front of me. I never dwelled on the recording (except long enough to study or marvel at it) and found myself easily and fully engaged by the performance and (without an A/B comparison to go on) I'm not sure how much better than that it can get. For me, a definite keeper.etwood Mac tune - a pleasant surprise for me. A treasure recovered.

0007208316|5.0|Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"William Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.<br /><br />The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.<br /><br />And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.<br /><br />But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.<br /><br />For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.<br /><br />There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").<br /><br />And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.<br /><br />Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest.age.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|The things I liked in this film. I liked the guy. I have seen him in other movies and he is someone that stood out to me. Summer is played by Zooey, who is really down to earth. I like her freeness in life. I liked the fun he had being with her. It was sad that she tended to not exude as much energy of happiness from their creative fun and tended to start to push him away from her. They played with their imagination which is so cool in any relationship. Being able to let your guards down and play is so innocent. I liked the scene when they both did karioke. And I liked the wedding where they were just friends but still had that ability to let go and have fun. What was dissappointing was the ending and her energy towards him being not as balanced. Yet this happens in real life and that makes it a movie that shines. I liked its creativeness with the characters and its scene where it incorporates dancing and a small bit of animation. I like when movies mix up different styles of filmmaking. I like films with Zooey. I think it was definately a movie to see. Things I would do from this film, would be to most definately have fun with karioke, the record store would be fun, I haven't been to one for a long time, the soundtrack was cool, the rain in the nite with the giant windows, it had a cozy feel, and the freeness of being happy and yourself with another who you like.

B002ZG997C|5.0|I am surprised to give 2 - 5 star reviews in one week. For unthinkable and now Eli.<br />First and foremost, I am Atheist and I loved this movie. Yes, there are great action/fight scenes, great acting and amazing writing (give credit where credit is due).<br />Mila Kunis who may not be taken as serious an actor as some may want will make you rethink those thoughts by her performance here.<br />I haven't been a Denzel fan for a while. This really made me come back to being a fan of his. He really played the part well and made you believe he was on a faith walk to some holy destination.<br />There is excellent foreshadowing all through the movie (thanks to the excellent writing) that by the end, you will say to yourself, \\"That's why he did (or said) that!\\".<br />It is a must-see movie.<br />Buy the Bluray. It comes with the Bluray, reg DVD and a digital copy plus more bonus material. The regular DVD alone is a rip-off to the public and has only 2 special features, a back story (comic) for the bad guy and very limited group of deleted scenes.
B00005R2IS|5.0|If you own this movie and have this version of it, then I'm sure you haven't even checked to see if the old US dubbed version of the dialog is included, because it was awful! well if you're like me, and you love this movie dearly as I do, then you have seen it countless times and know all the dialog, well here's the catch of my review of this version, the original version! Watch it on normal until the scene in the wreaking yard then change the sound to the US dialog, it is arguably the funniest thing ever to exist, that US dubbed dialog on that scene! The voice of the grease rat yard worker makes me cry with hysterical laughter every time I hear it, and if you love this movie as much as I do, you may want to get this version for the great original sound track of dialog and even the humorous aspects of the US dub!      The Special features are great, too! Kind of a heart breaker to hear the truth behind the scenes, but it's still wicked and worth every penny,   Not to mention it's the greatest movie ever to exist and will never be dethroned!
B00095NX9G|5.0|I received my copy of this DVD yesterday and have had a chance to review it today.  I have never written a review on a DVD I have purchased in the past but I felt I had to comment on this tape.  I have to honestly say that this is the best bellydance tape of this genre that I have purchased.  I wish it had been released years ago because it would have saved me a lot of money.  The yoga portion of the tape is gentle with clear and easy to follow instructions.  A lot of the poses are ones I used during physical therapy for strengthening my lower back but unlike my PT sessions this tape offered instructions that made it a lot easier to follow and in my opinion will prove to be more beneficial than the PT sessions I received because it is easier for me to follow.  I like the instructions of pulling in the low belly before doing any of the forward bends.  Also I noticed that there was usually a soft bend to her knees when doing the forward bends.  Doing these 2 things took a lot of the stress off of my low back.  I wish she would do an exclusively yoga tape.  Oh and by the way it also had one of the best shimmy drills offered on any tape/DVD I have seen so far.  This DVD was well worth purchasing.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Man On A Wire is one of those documentaries that stay with you. It is excellent and has a low to offer those of a thoughtful nature. First of all, it is a demonstration of the human spirit and the single-mindedness of the central character to perform an impossible feat: string a wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center and walk back and forth without a net. The footage is clearly amazing. Watching Mr. Petit walk back and forth on this wire (and at one point laying down  in the prone position on the wire) is staggering. His accomplishment was an unparalleled athletic performance that will never be repeated.     That alone warrants the purchase of the movie. However there is much more to be considered. Of particular interest is the slight of hand that was necessary to get to the top of the World Trade Center unobserved with all of the equipment. Though slow in parts, the fact that they (Petit and his associates) pulled it off will be quite amusing to many who watch the film. But there is much more to this part of the film than meets the eye. Let me explain this in terms of a metaphor.     I have a neighbor who has a large dog that kept escaping and running around at night. He tried everything and finally augment the 6 foot wooden fence, that was meant to contain his dog (\\"Buck\\"), with an electronic fence. It worked and the problem was solved. About a year or so later he had no problems with Buck escaping so he turned off the electricity as a cost saving measure. Buck has not tried to escape because he continues to believe that if he tries to get out he will get an electric shock. In some respects Buck the dog is everyman because he believes the \\"juice\\" is on and that he will be stopped from exercising his freedom. What this documentary also demonstrates brilliantly that we, like Buck, believe that we are constrained in our freedom. we believe that will be stop from entering or leaving certain places or not eligible for opportunities that are \\"restricted\\"rather than the many. The  bottom line is that dogs and people act upon what they believe to be real rather than what actually is real. In this regard Man On A Wire is a brilliant ethno-methodological study about reality and illusion. The reality was the central character's incredible skill to perpetrate this accomplishment with the illusions that were dispelled by him and his hearty band of non-conformists' ability to make it happen.

B0030ZOYHC|4.0|The animation is drastically improved over the anime series, with various computer generated animation overlaying seemlessly over the backgrounds. The sound is also stellar, especially on a home theater system.    For those who have never watched the anime series (I've personally never finished it, only seen the first few episodes), this is a great way to be introduced to one of the most interesting plots in science fiction. Though if you have watched this anime series, you'd notice several interesting...easter eggs throughout this \\"remake\\". Though it requires paying a lot of attention to a couple of shots and having a clear memory of what happened in the anime series.    Overall, a great buy when I purchased it on sale for around $20 here on Amazon.
B003HE2B6C|4.0|As usual, Shout It Out, Hanson's latest, doesn't disappoint.  The addition of a horn section really complements their more Stax-esque soulful sound on this album.  Lots of great, catchy songs, especially the first two.  My only complaints are no solo song by Isaac and, while the music is insanely catchy and the harmonies are amazing as always, their lyrics still could use some help.    But overall, this is a catchy album, with lots of great songs to blast in your car during the summer months and far beyond!

B0036EH3U2|5.0|This review is for the new and improved packaging.     This is a repackage of the Battlestar Glaactica Complete series. The older set had complaints about discs being scratched by the sleeves. This new and improved set does not have that problem. They are in plastic holders and I have not noticed a problem yet. There is no cylon figure included, but the plan is included this time. Face of the enemy webisodes are still missing, but I heard this is due to licensing disagreements. Caprica is not included either, but that's it's own show.     Personally, I like this box better. My own complete opinion here - the older box reminded me of the 1970's battlestar - more cheesy childish looking - that box is suited for a shelf in some kid's room with his action figures, unfixed bed and clothes all over the floor. This box shows the characters in black and white, is much more mature looking and more suited for this show. This box belongs on a shelf in Adama's quarters next to his books. I prefer to have this on my shelf rather than the other set.     Episode lists and synopsis are included - this helps in keeping track of which disc to put in to show which episode. One issue that I dislike is the habit of having extended episodes fleshed out on separate discs. For instance, the boxing episode on season 3 - on one disc has the original airing, and the next disc has the extended version that has additional 25 minutes. If you were watching it sequentially without reading the episode list beforehand, you would end up seeing the shorter version and then have to rewatch to see the extended scene.   Yes, this is a minor issue, but it can be annoying.     The custom menus and disc structure is very nice though - I like how the menu can be brought up while a episode is playing in the background, rather than other shows where the menu pauses the show and comes up - pulling you out of immersion. Features like bookmarks and the progress bar when you pause and unpause is awesome. There aretons of extras, commentary, bd live stuff, they really go all out on the extras, which is a definate plus. I even like the screensaver when you leave the show on pause for awhile. I'm not that knowledgeable in bluray authroing, but with the awesome menus and controls this disc has - why can't they make chapters out of the extended episodes in a way that if you run a episode, you can click the normal version aid it would just skip over the extended scenes, but if you click extended, then it plays all chapters?  Surely that would save disc space which can be used to push up the show's bitrate higher?    The show has a grain effect to it - this is part of the art form that is battlestar galactica. Dark and Gritty, just like the box art. Theres multiple warnings before some of the episodes indicating this, and on every episode of the first discs of season 1-4, theres commentary of Ronald D. Moore explaining this too. It would be great if he talked about it on the first episode of each season, but on every ep on the first discs of each season is a bit much.. With all that said - the 1080p quality is still better than the dvd version, the audio is better and the extras rock.    The show itself is awesome. I have been following it since the miniseries in 2003, and have watched it through to the end. I am going through it again now that I have it on Bluray. This show is dark, gritty, dramatic and not cheesy at all.

B002ZG997M|2.0|Warner Bros. cheated me and everyone else who bought the combo-pack of The Book of Eli by including a 3.35 GB SD DVD in this package.  SD DVDs of first run movies normally run 4.5 to 6.6 GB.  In order to include the digital copy of this movie on the DVD, Warner Bros. technicians reduced the size of the SD DVD movie to a very low 3.35 GB, for a movie with a reduced color palette that needs every bit of video data to look presentable.  The Blu-ray version looks fine, even if it takes forever to load, as you watch a time icon on the screen as the picture boots up.      The SD version includes the digital copy of the movie, something I can do without.  It is near impossible to watch the SD version on your computer, since the disc is programmed to go into the digital copy installation mode first.      With this combo-pack, Warner Bros. makes Walt Disney Blu-ray/DVD packages look good.  Walt Disney does not rip you off by selling you a reduced data DVD, even of it does load up the DVD with tons of coming attractions.  I thought I was getting a bargain, a Blu-ray for $25 that included the $17 SD version of the movie.  If Warner Bros. wants to sell what I consider to be a defective SD DVD, at the least it should state on the package that the enclosed DVD is an altered version not as good as the standalone SD DVD.    If the past is any guide, The Book of Eli's DVD and Blu-ray's prices should be going down in a month or so.  The Amazon price for the Blu-ray of $25 is worth it if you have to have the Blu-ray now.  I consider the SD DVD in this combo-pack a consumer ripoff by Warner Bros.    About the movie The Book of Eli...excuse me, I have run out of time, too busy slamming Warner Bros., so I am unable to comment on the movie now.

B001QOGYFO|3.0|Carrie (Kate Beckinsale) is a U.S. Marshall with a confidence problem.  She is sent to what should be the most stress-free post there is for the U.S. Marshall's;  Antartica.  As the only law enforcement presence on the continent, Carrie is kind of like a sheriff in a western.  Of course, Antartica is quite a bit bigger (and way more hostile!) than a town in the old west.<br /><br />Unexpectely, Carrie chances across some \\"action\\" as the corpse of a murdered man is found out in the middle of the wastelands.  It's up to Carrie to find the murderer, and her investigation untangles an elaborate scheme to smuggle the cargo of a forgotten transport plane out of the country.<br /><br />One of the most remarkable features of the film (aside from Kate, anyway), is the cinematography.  The filmmakers do a good job of making the austere landscape of Antartica into a bona-fide character in the story.  Some of the visuals are downright stunning and one momentarily forgets that it's the most inhospitable continent on the planet.<br /><br />Some will notice that nudity is listed as one of the reasons that the film was rated \\"R.\\"  People (like me!) may be curious as to whether Kate is in front of the camera wearing her birthday suit.  The resounding answer is \\"NO!\\"  The movie opens with Kate arriving in Antartica  & stripping down to take a shower, but the camera angles are creative enough so that you don't see anything.  It's a teaser scene that seems to have been thrown in there just to egg-on the viewers who are wondering what sort of \\"nudity\\" is in the film.  As it turns out, there are some males running around naked outside the compound, and that's it.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;boring<br /><br />If you're a fan of Kate (like me!) then this film is worth  watching.  If you're interested in Antartica, this movie is most assuredly worth a looking as it may be decades before another movie has a need to do any filming there.  It's not a great movie, but it is a decent one.  Thankfully, it stayed away from some common horror movie motifs which in the present movie would have been downright silly.

1416562605|5.0|This is a witty, fun read that reminded me a lot of \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"  Just as that book challenged the popular idea that children left alone on an island would develop a utopian civilization, \\"Tiger\\" goes after the idea that someone can win wealth through merit ala \\"Slumdog Millionaire.\\"  In \\"Tiger,\\" the protagonist gradually realizes the price he must pay to win his freedom from poverty, and then pays it.  The black humor in the book helps us grow fond of the protagonist despite his foul deeds, and makes it a far more entertaining read than LOF.
B0027BOL4G|2.0|Nothing but testimonials and no scientific backing at all. No double blind studies, and the evidence presented has been refuted by reputable scientists. So I am sorry if you watch this movie expecting to confirming your already biased opinions look elsewhere. Look it up, study it not everything in this documentary is wrong but some of the evidence presented has already been been refuted. Dig deeper and make sure your sources are from non-biased sources. You will find that many of the claims in the movie are just flat out unjustified by real science. Now don't get me wrong I hate big corporations, but I just not going to buy into claims that are not factually justified.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|For six years, \\"Daria\\" was a popular animated series for MTV.  The character which was featured on \\"Beavis and Butt-head\\" received her own animated show which was shown on MTV from 1997 through 2002 has received positive critical reviews and even did better than \\"Beavis and Butt-head\\" in ratings.<br /><br />The series which was created by Glenn Eichler (a former story editor for \\"Beavis and Butt-head\\" and \\"The Maxx\\") and Susie Lewis Lynn, \\"Daria\\" is a series about a misanthropic teenager named Daria Morgendorffer who speaks in a monotone voice and despite her intelligence, is not too favorable on her family and the people around her.

It is important to note that there is an insert featuring show creator Glenn Eichler explaining how 99% of the music (fortunately not the intro. song) were changed for this DVD release.

Creators talk about how the series came to fruition and the writers talk about developing the series while the voice talent talk about the popularity of the show.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Daria\\" is definitely a big part of American pop culture from the '90s leading up to the early 2000's.  Where most teen drama, especially on cable are all live, at the time, it was great to have a series with a character who was a misanthrope and a protagonist that wasn't super rich, absorbed in material things and pretty much, the series spoke to a lot of people.<br /><br />So, in many ways, \\"Daria - The Complete Animated Series\\" is a release that many people are going to buy and enjoy.  I know there are some people who have a problem with music being replaced but the fact is, \\"Daria\\" is not the first, it's happening to a lot of series and it has been so bad to the point that many series have not been released on DVD.  Licensing for music on DVD's have become too expensive and a lot of the shows that we enjoyed are having to dump the music out or the series is not being released at all.<br /><br />The good news is that unlike its predecessor \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" and unlike other television shows that utilized popular mainstream music, \\"Daria\\" had music but it was not the focal point of the series.  Aside from the main opening theme which is included on the episodes in this collection, it was the characters and the storylines that stood out for \\"Daria\\" and so, I can easily say that \\"Daria - The Complete Animated Series\\" is just as enjoyable without the original music.<br /><br />Overall, his is a wonderful set and I really believe that fans will enjoy this release.  All 66 episodes (inc. the pilot), two films and special features and the episodes look very good on DVD.  If you are a fan of \\"Daria\\", then I highly recommend \\"Daria - The Complete Animated Series\\"!.      * EPISODE 59 - Lucky Strike - With a teacher's strike at school, Ms. Li hires scabs temporarily to fill in as teachers.      * EPISODE 60 - Art Burn - Jane's has a new job but conflicts with her original work.      * EPISODE 61 - One J at a Time - Inspired by her sister, Quinn thinks about getting a boyfriend.      * EPISODE 62 - Life in the Past Lane - Jane dates a new guy who doesn't like Daria or Tom.      * EPISODE 63 - Aunt Nauseam - Helen's sister is dealing with her daughter's divorce and wants Helen to handle it.      * EPISODE 64 - Prize Fighters - Daria applies for a scholarship but discovers Jodie and Upchuck are going for it as well.

B003A4IFGY|5.0|We've all been there with a rock 'n roll act past their prime. They release a \\"blues\\" album. And it's OK. There are like 3 catchy songs and 8-10 mediocre songs. So when I heard Mojo was coming and it was \\"bluesy\\" with a \\"reggae\\" track my heart sank a little. Here we go again...    Well, I'm happy to say there is not that album. The songs are wonderful. This is easily Petty's best effort since Wildflowers. Yes, there is a definite blues influence but it still sounds like a Heartbreaker's album, too. The playing is top-notch. These songs sound great. Stuff I didn't even initially like (First Flash of Freedom) now sounds like it belongs in permanent rotation on the iPod. This is really good stuff.    On a more curious note, I have a playlist on my iPod called \\"new stuff\\" that basically has everything downloaded to the iPod in the last 30 days and today it had the Stone's Exile on Main Street and this album in it. The two really complemented each other very well as I listened to it. I never thought of the Stones as a big Petty influence but it is definitely there on Mojo. This may be the first album I spring for the Blu-Ray version. This band really sounds fantastic on this album.
0375703861|1.0|Let me just start off by saying that I expected the best from this book. Like many others purchasing White Teeth, this book was required reading for my English course. Unfortunately, by the end of the book I found myself amazed by the amount of time I had wasted.    Where to begin? There are no words to express the hatred that I had and have towards this book. I'm sure everyone has experienced a read like this before. It is one of those god-awful books where you read and re-read a page asking yourself \\"Why am I doing this?\\". The plot is pretentious at best, full of shallow-yet-complex characters who offer little-to-nothing to the story. At times it actually felt as if Zadie had run out of ideas, and was typing everything that came to her mind. Truly, I could not say that half of the text was relevant to the story in any way.    Honestly, I felt absolutely no connection with any of the obnoxious characters in this book. After the first 100 pages, I put the book down and wished that Archie had just killed himself in the chapter. Who are these people? Why do I care? Can Archie be any more overbearing? I assure you, no matter how much time you spend dissecting this sorry excuse for a book, you will never be able to find anything that was truly unique or worth your read. I read this book last September and, for the life of me, I cannot remember anything more to this story than an irritating British man who marries a toothless woman.     Please. Unless this book is required reading, save your money, spend time with your family, or just sit on the couch and stare at the ceiling. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
B00362DRNG|5.0|In the 80's a friend of mine had an imported vinyl copy of Carnival from the Netherlands, that had a version of Girls on Film on it that I had never heard before or since.  I had this version recorded to tape cassette at the time and it was the \\"extended\\" version of Girls on Film that I knew. Over the years, various releases of the night version of Girls on Film were released, but it was never the one that I had on this tape. Finally, this elusive mix has turned up in this package as the Extended Night Version. The package says it has been previously unreleased, but that is actually not the case if you count this vinyl release from the 1980's. The album is top rate and always has been one of my all time favourites. The remaster quality is ok, but does suffer from compression, although not as bad as some other releases.    Worth picking up for the version of Girls on Film, along with the demos.  The rest of the material is available elsewhere, but the good thing about this is it is all together in one package.
6305781427|1.0|I have the original VHS recording and love it.  I tried to update with this DVD.  The color saturation on this DVD is so overdone that sometimes we were unable to see faces.  What a terrible disappointment!
1594744475|5.0|Yum-Yum Bento Box delivers page after page of adorable and yummy food packed creatively into a bento box!  The bentos and recipes are simple and easy to recreate.  I love the fact that the pages are filled with gorgeous photos of the bentos as well as instructional step-by-step pictures of how to create these cute characters.  This book is definitely a must buy!
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I do not need other reviews to confirm the excellence in acting this series portrays. It has been a very good experience to watch Seasons 1 and 2. What I find irritating is the many times the second season is announced for purchase, but is as yet unavailable.  What is taking so long? Has it been a year since the second season finished? Will there ever be a third season, an if so, will it ever be available? Just release season 2 so we can buy it!
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Many bands coming off a long absence are making a grab for some cash, but this album sounds like a serious attempt at producing good music, and it succeeds.  Many of the songs have smart lyrics and the catchy beats DEVO is known for.  Not only do I enjoy it, but it has caught the attention of my teenage daughter.

B0000029AP|1.0|I first bought this album on 8-track when it was originally released and that 8-track sounded better than this CD. I'm so dissapointed in the sound quality.    Remember the first CD that you heard of a song that you were familiar with and you heard thngs that you never knew were there? This is just the opposite; the recording is so muddy that things you know are there are inaudible. I had to check my settings to make sure that the kids hadn't turned the treble and bass all the way down.     This is no sizzle to the cymbals, no punch to the bass and no twang to the guitar. This CD sounds like it was mastered from an MP3 at the very lowest quality setting.
0684833395|1.0|I cannot see why this book is considered a 20th century classic.  It was a chore to trudge through it.  What is the point? Yes yes, war is hell, and yes, the military has a lot of stupid regulations, but really, is it all really necessary?    This book is apparently supposed to be funny. Perhaps the monotonous dialogue that I imagine is supposed to pass as witty banter was new and funny in the '50's, but now it is just tiring.    An example:  \\"...I have a liver condition.\\"  \\"Oh yes, I forgot,\\" said Milo, in a voice lowered deferentially. \\"Is it bad?\\"  \\"Just bad enough,\\" Yossarian answered cheerfully.  \\"I see,\\" said Milo. \\"what does that mean?\\"  \\"It means that it couldn't be better.\\"  \\"I don't think I understand.\\"  \\"...without being worse. Now do you see?\\"  \\"Yes, now I see. But I still don't think I understand.\\"  \\"Well, don't let it trouble you. Let it trouble me. You see, I don't really have a liver condition. I've just got the symptoms. I have a Garnett-Flieschaker syndrome.\\"  \\"I see,\\" said Milo. \\"And what is a Garnett-Flieschaker sybnrome?  \\"A liver condition.\\"    Hilarious right?\\"

B001GCUO5W|4.0|Having never read Dennis Lehane's novel, I didn't quite know what to expect of Shutter Island, which re-unites Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese but finds the legendary director in a bit of a change of pace with this suspense/thriller as opposed to his past few works.  DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who, along with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) come to the island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate of the island's hospital for the criminally insane.  What begins as a \\"whodunit with everyone hiding something\\" develops into something else entirely, with a twist that you will more than likely see coming almost a mile away.  That aside though, Shutter Island as a whole is a more than competantly made thriller.  DiCaprio is quite good, as are Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as the facility's head doctor, with smaller roles from Michelle Williams, Max Von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, and Ted Levine; while the film boasts some wonderful cinematography and film editing.  With a fairly unsettling conclusion, Shutter Island may not be the kind of film that one would expect from Martin Scorsese, but if there's anything that the legendary director may be familiar with, it's with providing audiences with the unexpected, and that in itself makes the film so worthwhile in the first place.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals.  I have loved it for a long time, but was finally able to by it for myself.  I love the songs and the characters, especially Colonel Pickering.  I would recommend this movie to most anyone who enjoys a good musical, with some comedy intertwined in it.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This album is absolutely  incredible. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt I should. This cd is amazing. For once, real music from two premier artists. The production is tight and on point. I'm just lost for words.
0316044695|5.0|Once you pick this book up you will find it hard to put down. Marcus Luttrell did a great service to Mike Murphy and the other three SEALS who died in Afghanastan during one of the most dangerous missions imaginable. Luttrell also did a great service to America by telling his story of what an American Serviceman is capable of enduring. I could not recommend this book more. A word the wise however...Don't pick up in the evening or you will not sleep that night.   Norman Fulkerson  Author of [[ASIN:1877905410 An American Knight: The Life of Colonel John W. Ripley, USMC]]

0307594777|5.0|I am not given to reading \\"thrillers\\" but the first book in this trilogy kept showing up within my line of vision...so, I bought it at a warehouse store and lo and behold...GREAT READ.  It was slow, at first, the plot didn't really grab me, but suddenly I was pulled.  As I said, I'm not given to thrillers; this one 'got' to me!  It was painful waiting for the sequels to arrive; now I'm midway through the third book and I'm heartsick that it will all come to an end!  Stieg Larsson did a good job at character development and setting a suspenseful tone.
B001GM28HO|5.0|A fan of Christina  so I am reluctant to write a review on Gaga but after the release of Ms. Aguilera, I am so disappointed and I think this CD must deserve some praise. This is the best dance music out there right now if you don't care for Bieber that much. Lady Gaga is not famous at the releasing of this CD but she does now thanks to her talents (she's not that pretty but hey I just care for the music).   The sounds are very catchy and unique and I just love it. I heard it's called electronic new disco. These days music are  too explicit and it is just to me unapporriate. I just like the clean one and NOT Christian music as well. At first I like the first songs at the first half of the album but now I started to explore and like the second half eventhough the lyrics is a bit more edgy...
B003C1SPX8|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite concert recordings.  One of Mark Knopfler's big things was to record the concerts and INCLUDE the mistakes, and there are mistakes.  There's a hum during Once Upon a Time In the West.  Yes, there are some cheesy camera effects (that's not Mark's reflection in the camera lens, but you probably figured that one out).    All that said, the mistakes are what makes this show great, along with Mark's guitar proficiency.  This is Dire Straits at their finest.  Be sure to watch for the rock star Joop DeCourt jumping around in the background while playing one key at a time!

B003HE2B6C|3.0|\\"Shout It Out\\" is a very fun, retro, pop album. It is impossible to sit still while listening to several of the tracks. The album lacks substance, however, and slows down considerably after \\"Make It Out Alive\\". But the several stand out songs make it worthwhile.
B002QP145C|5.0|The winter war  was actually part of world war 2, as hitler had given permision in a way for stalin to grab what  he could , if fact they split Poland in two! Stalin also invaded the latvia , lithuania, and estonia.  Only finland was able to hold the soviets off at all during this period.  And to this day they are a free country.<br />This is a good war movie, it's long but most of it takes place on the battlefield as we follow a company of soldiers who march of to war and most somehow survive.<br />The fins spent alot on this movie and they blow up alot of stuff.  The planes and tanks look pretty close to what the russians actually used too.  This movie is not a bad war movie , it's a foriegn language war movie about a true story. By the end of the movie the Finns are reduced to young boys in uniform as their losses were hideous.  The movie spends the first third of it with the company and we get to know them and then we watch them slowly pay the ultimate price for freedom.<br />One memorable lines is when a soldier on leave is asked about the heroes of talian and he says\\" the heroes of talian are all dead\\".  This doesn't have any cgi effects and in spite of that it's still a good war movie. The real war would look much worse than this for sure. But you still get the idea generally of how bad it was.<br />The fins later went back to war with germany as their allie but it doesn't lesson the struggle for freedom that this movie honors.  The  picture looks good on this dvd and it has english subtitles. This is the longer version and is long enough to run over two discs. So you can watch part one and then go back and watch part 2 later. It's the length of a two part miniseries and it's worth your time if you want to at least get a taste of what the finnish army and people went through.
0307455874|5.0|The second work by Barack Obama shows how the politician has matured, but is still learning and developing his ideals and strategies. It is as well written as the first book, Dreams of My Father, and is difficult to put down, although it is clearly aimed at American citizens and is, therefore, not always as interesting for non-American readers.    There is some imbalance in the book. For instance, The World beyond Our Borders has more emphasis on certain parts of the world such as Indonesia and Vietnam, rather than others. On the other hand the chapters that deal with issues such as values are thought provoking.     Despite the shortcomings, I rate this as a 5 star book because it has the potential to be a great asset to readers.     The chapter on race is particularly interesting to the reviewer who is from a diverse background, and is conscious of the debates in Britain about issues of race and culture. As is typical of the book, this chapter is not a systematic analysis of Obama's views on race. But it is even more significant because he analyses where and why debates on multicultural issues are where they are. There is a lot that British politicians and activists on racial issues can learn from that.    This is a very honest account of how Obama, before he took over the office of the President, experienced and understood how the political system in the USA works. In many ways it reminds us of The Prince, by Machiavelli. The first few chapters contain descriptions and observations that begin to give a voter, in any democratic country in the world, an insight into how the system is operated for the interests of a few, supported by the majority. One can read about how the media is a great manipulator, how political parties can become rigid and almost autocratic, and how politicians make decisions about how to vote, not in a chamber for debates, but behind the scenes.    Some writer can make a study guide for a democratic  political system out of this book.
B00275EGWY|1.0|Is it a decent movie?  Well, in my opinion it's fair.  If you like action flicks, it's probably worth a view.  However the maniacal producers behind this movie have decided to declare war against fans, filing thousands of lawsuits against those who dare to download this movie via BitTorrent or P2P networks.      These shotgun lawsuits inevitably catch the innocent (Google it, you'll see), but this is something the morons behind Hurt Locker consider acceptable collateral damage, I suppose.  The mass lawsuit campaign sure worked out well for the RIAA, didn't it?  Metallica sure has done well since they helped bury Napster, haven't they?  Apparently, those who fail to learn from history are indeed doomed to repeat it.    Nothing these idiots are involved in will ever earn any money from me, my family, or my friends, ever.  Their crusade will do more harm to their brand than any revenue they might actually scrape up.  Nicolas Chatrier got barred from the Oscars because of his insane hatred and has arguably (and in a very short time) attached more infamy to his name than Manson could ever dream of.    I'm not here to justify file sharing, or uploading/downloading copyrighted content.  I am here to say one simple thing to the producers of Hurt Locker...    You're doing it wrong.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I found out about this movie in a class and thought it was really interesting even before I saw the whole movie. When I watched it for the first time I knew this was a movie I wanted to own. I spent two years in Central and Eastern Europe and I met a lot of people who lived through WWII and told me about what it was like. I saw many Jewish synagogues that were now empty-merely monuments to what used to be a thriving culture. This movie sends such a wonderful message about what it is we should remember about the tragedy there. It also has a wonderful message about understanding others and ultimately, understanding ourselves. I love this movie! Also, it is sometimes difficult to find this movie so I think Amazon is great and it was shipped to me in a couple of days. Awesome find to say the least.
B003ELOQD4|1.0|I've been a U2 fan for a long time and travelled hundreds of miles to see U2's opening night show at Soldier Field in September '09. What I wanted out of this video is something that would be a momento of that tour, regardless of the fact that this DVD was at the end of the tour, the setlist is similar and of course the show and band were fantastic.    I put this disk in the player only to find that some marketing genius decided it would be a good idea to SKIP THE FIRST f-ing song!!!!! When you go to a show there's a sense of excitement and build-up as the entrance music plays, as the band takes the stage, and as the first few riffs of the first song bounce off the audience creating that huge wave of joy. This video doesn't represent the tour as I remember it simply by the fact they cut all of that out and went to the second song.    I understand they are trying to push the HD/Blu-ray medium, and they included Breathe as a bonus feature, but to edit it out of the beginning of the main presentation just suck in every way.    I'm sorry but this is EPIC FAIL in my book and whoever came up with this idea should be required to do nothing more than ask \\"do you want fries with that\\" as a career.    I'm sorry but this doesn't get more than a single star for this reason alone.

1439190275|5.0|Dr. Atkins was right on and it's a shame that the public, as such, doesn't use his approach.  This doctor was maligned for years when he was correct all along.  This book is his latest book, his first having come out in the 1970's.  You keep hearing things like he died from his own diet and that's a falsehood (unadulterated rubbish!!  He died because he slipped on ice, fell and hit his head, went into a coma and never came out of it).  Anyone can benefit from this book.  His diet is a low-carb diet and there are 4 phases and so easy to follow.  I am 16 lbs down with 12 to go.  America is fat from too many carbs, not too much fat!! If people only knew.  At any rate, buy this book and take it to heart.  I guarantee you, you will never be fat again in your life and you will never be hungry.  This book is worth every penny.
0307408833|4.0|Okay, so not all gluten-free, some ingredients are costly (not the author's fault!) and some not easy to find (also not her fault).  That said, I'll be forever grateful to this book for teaching me how to make lovely cakes.  I've even found the confidence, as a new GF dieter, to experiment a little with her recipes.  It has been invaluable to me to see how to use the inexpensive Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour to make cakes/muffins without having to buy still more ingredients.  (I'm lucky, I don't find the beany taste strong or offensive, and bean flour is the healthiest flour we can eat --and if you use lots of vanilla, you might not mind it either.)

B001GGZJ08|5.0|I can't decide whether Green River or Bayou Country is my favorite CCR album. I used to have this on vinyl 'back in the day' when new record releases meant a trip to that local record shop, one flight of stairs down from the 5&10 store, where you could buy peace symbol decals for your hs locker and incense and underground newspapers from San Francisco. Whenever I go out to Utah I make sure I'm blasting the track \\"Green River\\" as I detour off I-70 in- you guessed it- Green River.

B003AYPMBU|3.0|The only reason to buy this package is the DVD of course as the label couldn't see fit to include anything extra on the CD that wasn't there on the previous upgrade.  And as much as I would like to be raving about the Aug 2009 performance on the DVD, I can't.... it just wasn't very exciting.  Yes it's very cool when a group performs an entire album start to finish on stage, but that's not enough on its own to make it worthwhile.  The songs sounded tired.  Halford's voice is still amazing, but I wish he wouldn't wear 50 lbs of clothes on stage.  It makes me uncomfortable just watching him in all that getup!  I've noticed over the last few years that he sings more and more in a doubled-over stance, like he's singing to the floor instead of the audience.  Maybe it's all that gear weighing him down!    I see some other reviewers disagree with this, but I found the interview part of the DVD the most interesting aspect of it.  Granted there were no earth-shattering revelations as the four of them commented on British Steel track by track, but there was some nice banter between them.    A very decent price, especially if you don't have the CD already (blasphemy!), but just not a very remarkable live show.
B002ZG983M|5.0|******* SPOILERS ABOUND *******<br /><br />The above line is not uttered in the new blockbuster superhero movie, KICK ASS, but believe me, you won't miss it. The exclamation comes at the climax of the graphic novel, where Hit Girl dispatches bad guys into the after life like a pint sized cute as a button grim reaper!<br /><br />If ever there was a title that encompasses all that a movie rises to the occasion to be, KICK ASS is most definitely it! This film single handedly raises the bar for the superhero movie. Possessed of a great script, with fantastic acting all around (Nicholas Cage's Big Daddy rendering is both creepy and hilarious), and balls to the wall action set pieces, KICK ASS is in a class by itself.<br /><br />Based on the graphic novel of the same name, KICK ASS tells the story of comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson, wonderful in the lead role), who wonders aloud one day to friends why no one has dared become a superhero. Of course, the answer to his query is simple - because they'd get their ass kicked. Undaunted, Dave orders a green scuba wet suit off E-Bay, and hurls himself into superhero daring do, only to get his ass kicked to the point of hospitalization. Anyone sane would have severed the idea in their skull of pursuing the mantle of superhero, but part of the premise of KICK ASS is just that - you'd have to be out of your damned mind to do it. And sho nuff, Dave licks his wounds and once more prowls the night streets to fight crime and is finally triumphant, and much to his surprise he becomes a You Tube celebrity. And then he meets the competition.<br /><br />Where Kick Ass has more passion than prowess, Big Daddy and Hit Girl are the real thing; highly trained masked vigilantes on a mission of murder. When Hit Girl makes her entrance (the excellent Chole Moretz in an absolute break out role) the film turns the corner. Slicing and dicing bad guys like the Bride from Kill Bill as a preteen, Hit Girl steals the movie from the moment she appears. Cursing up a storm of expletives and possessed of martial art skills that are literally scalpel sharp, Hit Girl seals her iconic status as a screen heroine, or is that killer? This is the scene that had moral watchdog groups aghast, and no doubt this scene figured in Roger Ebert's giving the film one star - that's right one star. Moretz's Hit Girl is nothing short of astounding. When she's on the screen you can't take your eyes off her.<br /><br />Equally of note is Nicholas Cage's turn as Big Daddy. Many are calling this role his best in years. How does one pull off conveying a loving doting father one minute and a cold blooded killer the next? Cage does it with gusto. In what for me was one of the most disturbing scenes in the film, Cage channels the voice and mannerisms of the Adam West Batman. He and Hit Girl find where Kick Ass resides and try to convince him to team up with them. The scene is rather short but conveys a great deal. While watching I found myself thinking, this man is clearly insane and he's the father of a 12 year old murderess. Yep, KICK ASS is that twisted.<br /><br />Before I go on let me offer a warning. This film is not for the even remotely squeamish. KICK ASS is reprehensible, decadent, sadistic, offensive, and uber violent and I loved every millisecond. I have no doubt it will go cult, and will be a guilty treat of many (for the fanboys it's already etched in stone). But hey, I stray.<br /><br />At once reverential and at the same time pissing on the altar, KICK ASS alters the paradigm of the superhero movie. It is a breath of fresh air for a genre that can at times be ponderous (Watchmen, anyone?). It is a fast paced well written and acted thrill ride that offers something different for moviegoers glutted on the previous staple.<br /><br />Believe me, if you love the genre you will love this film. The production values are exemplary, the action scenes at times are startling, the screenplay is a diamond, and the acting is consistently well done.<br /><br />That ball is still hurtling out of the park.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Something has happened on Shutter Island and it is up to two law enforcement officals to figure out what. One is a seasons veteran and the other is his new partner, and they both find themselves pulled into something that seems much more difficult than a case of a missing woman. This leads the lead detective to question what is going on, and before long he finds himself wondering what secrets lie in this place that holds so many secrets about everything - including himself.<br /><br />On many levels, I thought this film was a great piece of work. It had all the elements one would want from a movie develing into a place that treats the worst types of criminal minds, with it looking at everything through the eyes of both patients and detectives. It has secret plots and twists, a lot of things you can't trust, and a plot that leaves you wondering what Leo really knows as he walks through his investigation.<br /><br />There were a few times in the movie I found myself able to predict what was going on, and some of that really hurt the ending. I think that is because movies have to have some catch these days, but this catch is one that is both interesting and hard to talk about without saying too much. If, for instance, you review for content, you will say too much. Even discussing characters says some things that possibly shouldn't be said. So, instead of going that route, I will simply say that the plot is great, the effects have an impact, and the end is one that completes a puzzle and makes you feel sorrow at the same time.<br /><br />Would I say buy this film? I'm torn on that one. I would say that you would like to watch it more than once, and that it would be something that makes more sense as you catch all the little pieces. Still, I didn't benifit from the buy itself because I watched all these parts all at once, but cannot find a reason that a person would not want to buy it simply because it has so much to offer.<br /><br />Read reviews on it, be really careful if a person says anything about spoilers, and enjoy your film. You will enjoy it, too, because it is hard not to. Its like a puzzle you have to put together and, when you do, you find yourself rewarded.<br />Personally, I liked what Leo did here, and the way his character brings everything to light.t spoilers, and enjoy your film.

B00006LPER|5.0|I happened to watch this film again last night, and I must say that Haneke is a director you have to allow to infiltrate you're way of thinking in order to really understand his work.  He has a very distinct viewpoint and is certainly a visionary, and so his films carry with them hidden layers of emotional confliction that I think are pertinent to appreciating them.  `La Pianiste' is a dark and disturbing film that could be (wrongfully) disregarded as perverse filth, but there is so much more involved here.<br /><br />Throwing this film to the side due to its graphic nature is denying it the admiration it deserves.<br /><br />The film centers around a middle aged woman named Erika Kohut, a piano teacher who lives at home with her mother and secretly hides her own perverse fantasies; sneaking off to buy smut and witness adult films.  Erika is cold and seemingly bitter, a woman who is envious of her young students and strangely dependant on her mother.  Her world is turned upside down when she encounters a young man named Walter Klemmer, an arrogant student with talent who cares little for music itself and more for the attention his hands can get him.  Erika is repulsed yet fascinated to the point where she dares let him inside her head.  Once he has been allowed to see her for who she really is, he challenges her, defying her wishes and showing her that her own desires are not necessarily her own.<br /><br />Michael Haneke is known for his dissection of violence and society.  He is constantly tackling that very subject with fresh ideas that capitalize on his gritty sense of realism and sharp eye for detail.  Taking the lines one crosses, meshing together the emotions of love and hate, Haneke creates a startling character study that leaves the audience much like Erika, and later Walter...<br /><br />Repulsed yet fascinated.<br /><br />The character of Erika Kohut is a mesmerizing one, because she is so easily condemned for her actions and desires but this is a grave misunderstanding of a woman oppressed by her natural surroundings.  She is a woman who has suffered the loss of a father (to insanity) and continually suffers the confinement that comes from paternal control (her mother still treats her as if she were a child).  She is lost within her own passions, surrounded by young students who lack the knowledge she has yet she is grossly aware that they will amount to more than she ever will.  She is insulted by their mediocre talents.  Erika is also alone, lonely within her own view of love.  Being controlled and looked down on, she craves someone to dominate her.  She puts up the air that she is cruel and controlling and domineering, but she is begging, pleading with the world to knock her down.  She has such lack of control within her own life that she needs to control her idea of intimacy.  Finding escape in the voyeuristic engagements suited for a prepubescent boy, Erika taints her own understanding of love by feeding herself the filth propagated by the media.  She becomes her own worst enemy, and thus falls victim to her own carnal misunderstandings.<br /><br />When Walter gives in and `gives her what she wants', it literally destroys her.<br /><br />The film is, on its own, a masterpiece and a force to be reckoned with, but without the dedicated and fearless performance given by Isabelle Huppert the film would not have had nearly the effect needed to sustain it.  When you think of performances that `go there', that really throw caution to the wind and allow themselves to embody a single character, this is one that should instantly come to mind.  Huppert does shy away from the character flaws within Kohut.  She attacks them head on, unlocking this characters inner most secrets and exposing her full frontal for the world to see.  With a performance that includes self mutilation, public urination, proposed incest, total humiliation and twisted perversions of the unmentionable kind, Huppert never flinches in her delivery.  What is even better is that she accompanies each scene with the needed emotional connection to make it wholly believable.  Watching the coldness melt off her face as she faces rejection from the one she has bared her soul too, it is unbelievably sympathetic.  For a woman who has been so rigid and so evil (enough to viciously attack a student) we feel an honest sense of connection to her in that state of turmoil.<br /><br />Huppert is accompanied by some great supporting players, not the least of which is Benoit Magimel, who stuns as her lover Walter.  Witnessing his initial admiration for Erika dissipate into a hysterical observation and then completely manic obsession is brutal and nerve-racking.  Annie Girardot is wickedly amusing as Erika's mother, a woman who is at the center of her daughters own collapse.<br /><br />In the end, `La Pianiste' is NOT a film for everyone, but it is a film that will provoke you and stir you enough to validate its existence.  Michael Haneke is not a shy director, and he does not create fluff films.  His films are meant to be analyzed, studied and discussed.

0545140315|4.0|I loved this book on so many different levels.<br /><br />First, let me say that Eulberg did a fantastic job of weaving the music of the Beatles into the very foundation of this story.  From the names of the Bloom children to the flower power way of life her parents led all elements of the infusion were sheer perfection.  I mean, seriously, how can a Beatles lover not like a book whose chapter titles are song names/lyrics?<br /><br />Now, let me move on to the biggest reason why I loved this book.  I thought the lesson it has to teach young girls was filled with positivity.  It didn't preach being spiteful or mean-spirited.  The concept of The Lonely Hearts Club was productive and the fact that it was built on the concept of creating, sustaining and building friendships made it a lovely way for a young girl to work through the devastating heart-break of losing first love.  Particularly given the fact that she works her way through it all to realize that this love was one-sided and perhaps thought (on her part) to be more than it really was.<br /><br />Speaking of friendships, I adored the multitudes of relationships Penny and her friends crafted.  From the quirky territorial best friend, to the former BFF who dumped her for a boy friend then sought refuge in the club, to the girls who joined the just to be part of what was building to be the popular crowd, the characters were both realistic and enjoyable to read.  Add to that the dumb, possessive, big man on campus jock-type that thought every girl wanted him and the sweet natured friend who happens to be a boy and you have the perfect recipe for age-appropriate teenaged angst.<br /><br />Though Penny's parents were flighty in the stereotypical hippie-type way I found them to be equally supportive given their lack of information about Penny's situation with Nate.  They trusted her judgement, backed-her up when she was faced with adversity at school and were loving, helpful and caring individuals.  I'll add that they also added in a healthy dose of humor to the overall story.<br /><br />I strongly encourage those young and old to read this book.  It was good fun and filled with valuable life lessons about individuality, hoard mentality, love, and friendship.humor to the overall story.

B00004RF97|5.0|I enjoyed 'High Society' - the remake of 'Philadelphia Story' but after seeing my new DVD with Hepburn, Grant and Stewart, I must admit the original is the gold standard for this story!
006145205X|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read lately and one of the few I can honestly say changed my world view. The subtitle is \\"how prosperity evolves\\" and I had little appreciation of how rapidly and irreversibly the world has changed for the better.<br /><br />The book is jam packed with facts about the history of mankind starting with the early hominids. How civilizations decline was also outlined and I found that an interesting aspect of the book as there are many half-truths and myths about the subject. The author also details the history of naysayers and other self-proclaimed but ultimately false prophets of doom. In our troubling times it is good to review a countervailing theory to the gloom-and-doom of most prognosticators. His analysis isn't without flaws. He does gloss over Enclosure Laws in Great Britain, for example. But this book will nevertheless challenge closely held convictions of people of all political persuasions. I had to revise some of my political ideas and feel I am better for it. You may feel this is a bit radical after reading a single book but Matt Ridley's ideas are that compelling.<br /><br />The main premise, among many fascinating ideas, is that specialization has allowed mankind to leverage its knowledge and essentially magnify the productivity of each individual. It is a process unique to humans and the cause for the rapid expansion of life enhancing technology. His view of the future is not only rosy, but rational. The author encourages us in his closing words to \\"dare to be optimistic\\". Thanks to his compelling narrative I plan to do exactly that.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|There are several differences between the original movie shown in theaters and this Donner version. Most of my favorite scenes are missing, as well as a plausible ending. For Donner to chose this ending, which is completely and utterly unoriginal, made the final diner revenge scene between Clark and the bully impossible.<br /><br />Here's a few of the endearing scenes that were left out of Donner's version.<br /><br />The Paris bomb scene where Lois gets into trouble -- Missing.<br />Lois jumps into Niagara Falls -- Missing.<br />Clark trips in hotel suite and shoves his hand into fire -- Missing.<br />Female villain arm-wrestles in rural bar -- Missing.<br />Clark kisses Lois to make her forget Superman -- Missing.<br />Since it has been years since I watched the original there are probably many more missing scenes.<br /><br />What Donner gives us is a confusing start that relies on the first movie. Anyone who hasn't seen Superman 1 will be completely lost.<br /><br />Blanks or no blanks, it is inconceivable that Lois would pull a pistol out of her purse and shoot Clark Kent in the chest just to prove he is Superman. Earlier, Lois had sketched glasses and a hat on a photo of Superman, convinced herself that Clark Kent was the superhero, and then jumped out of Daily Planet's window in front of Clark. Maybe this would work in a cartoon, but not for anybody above the age of 6.<br /><br />The one added scene that I enjoyed was finding out how Clark Kent got his powers back after he willing gave them up to become human. That touching scene between Reeves and Brando should have been put into the original Superman 2. Without it we never understood the consequences of Superman's actions, nor the price his father paid to restore his powers.<br /><br />All in all, this Donner version is a huge disappointment. If you're expecting the same Superman 2 that you fell in love with, along with some added footage, you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, the added clip of Superman and his father in the ice home is worth the cost of a rental.

0790729407|4.0|For a film that is overly long in parts, drug out in others and at times a tad confusing (if you are not familiar with the subject matter) the riveting performances help bolster us along, keeping us more than entertained.  I am obviously not as enthusiastic about the film as a whole as some people here, but I do admit that it is certainly worth your time and Neeson's brilliant performance should have netted him an Oscar.<br /><br />The film revolves around the Irish Republic and their war with British troops in Ireland.  At times the film can be hard to follow, mainly for those of us not familiar with Irish history.  As far as the history part goes, I was blind walking in.  Either they didn't bother to broach this in my school, or I wasn't paying attention (which could have very well been the case, since history was not a favorite subject of mine).  I'm a little disappointed in myself at that, since I am now rather engaged by history and wish I knew a little more than I do.  That said, the film does a good job of attempting to illuminate us all, even the ones who don't know right from left.  While it never gets down to spelling everything out for us, it does try and give us enough backdrop so that we can draw our own conclusions.  This works and then again doesn't work.  We are drawn into Collins' world (albeit not as richly as I would have liked), but the film does tend to get tiresome at times.<br /><br />It feels, at moments, to be long winded.<br /><br />The romantic sub-plot seemed like an afterthought for me.  I wasn't too keen on its inclusion and actually feel that, had it been stripped, the film would have progressed along at a more admirable pace without losing any of the back-story needed to keep the audience informed.<br /><br />One thing that cannot be knocked is the tremendous acting by (nearly) the entire cast.  Even the small roles filled by the likes of Stephen Rea are fleshed out thanks to some dedicated performances.  Julia Roberts, while suffering from my least favorite `plot point' in the film, delivers an admirable performance, and doe-eyed Aidan Quinn serves as a nice contrast to the righteous indignation dripping off of Neeson.  I actually love Alan Rickman, but I do find it slightly off-putting that he is generally typecast as the `creepy bad guy'.  Yes, his voice is eerie, but some of his best performances come when he is playing totally against type (see his stunning performance in `Sense and Sensibility' and even `Love, Actually').  This is not my favorite performance by him, and in fact I found the `obviousness' about his characters loyalties to be a deterrent to the film itself.<br /><br />And then there is Liam Neeson, who just commands every frame with a thick fervor that is just engrossing to witness.  He takes this character and makes him so rich and so relatable and in the end so endearing.  You want him to win!<br /><br />In the end this is definitely a film to see, especially if you are a history buff and or a fan of this genre in particular.  The film maintains a serious and almost espionage tone, which is enjoyable, and the performances by nearly everyone in the cast is more than enough to satisfy the audience.oint' in the film, delivers an admirable performance, and doe-eyed Aidan Quinn serves as a nice contrast to the righteous indignation dripping off of Neeson.

0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the best book I've read in a long time. This book was suggested to me and I could not stop reading it. I ended up buying the rest of the trilogy. At first, I did not think I was going to like it because of the names and places are Swedish and sometimes I was confused as to whether it was a name or place. However, I figured it out and would recommend this book to everyone. It is a very powerful book and I even went to go see the movie. As with any movie that is made into a book, some things were different but it kept to the book as much as possible.
0785134352|5.0|What a fantastic read!  I actually had to read it twice in a row to get it out of my head.  Much darker and deeper than I imagined possible of a story called \\"Kick-Ass\\".  I love this read and would heartily recommend it to anybody.  Only problem is, now I kind of don't want to see the movie, because I've heard there are some plot changes in the movie script, and in my mind \\"Kick-Ass\\" is perfect as written.  Anyway, I still hold Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, as my favorite graphic novel of all time, but Kick-Ass is so good, it's really close.
0446402397|5.0|I'm not sure how I came by this paperback and it took me awhile to get into the book but once I did.... WOW! I gave my paperback to a friend who has since passed it on.  I now have the Kindle version and have re-read it twice.  The depiction of 1950's Russia, the culture of fear and the taught writing, dialogue and intricate plot make this one of the best thriller/mysteries I've read in years. It was fascinating, exciting, thrilling, and thought-provoking. I hope others enjoy this as much as I did.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|My husband and I really don't watch many TV shows, however I saw one rerun of SOA, and was hooked.  I immediately bought the complete first season so my husband could watch this show too.  We did not leave our bed until the whole season was finished!  I am amazed at the storyline in this show, it is the best show on TV right now, and I hope it continues for many seasons to come.
1557048630|5.0|I'm not a huge collector of art books like some are--not being an artist, I have to be stunned enough by the animation (and the film itself) to want the art book. So this is perhaps the third one I've ever purchased, but it certainly fit my amateur art critic qualifications.<br /><br />The book is stunning, from the incredible cover to all the little drawings once would expect from an art book.  Cressdia Cowell's preface sets up the emotion of the collection, and everything flows right in that vein of explaining all the art that went into the movie.<br /><br />The book is well-organized, its chapters focusing on characters, background, dragons, etc., making a straight-through read logical and a delve for something specific easy.  To my surprise and delight, even Cowell's book illustrations have been included to demonstrate the inspirations.  Sketches as well as fantastical concept art that seems to exist simply for beauty's sake are all in here.  And, as every art book should have, the Powers That Be have included plenty of great notes and thoughts about the work.<br /><br />This should please fans of art as well as those who simply loved the movie.
0790731452|3.0|We saw part of this at a restaurant bar and thought  it would be fun to see.  It is a spoof on \\"independence Day\\".  Funny, but just okay. I think teeneagers would like it best.
1400049628|2.0|I was given this book as a gift by a friend who knew my love of the zombie genre in film and writing.  The book is well written and funny, as I should expect considering the author's father, but being a 'zombie nerd' I found it....uninformative?  My fascination with the subject has led me to most of the conclusions he has come to.  In fact, I think my 'Zombie Apocalypse' plan is superior!  Funny book, but you would have come to the same conclusions were you to live for the first few days of the coming of the zombie hordes!  Or better ones!
0307454541|1.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did, but now that it's over I'm left trying to figure out why anyone would like it? The writing is dull and painfully drawn out, the characters are unbelievable and unsympathetic, and the ending was predictable - at least I had it pretty much pegged. When I finally, laboriously made it the the 2nd ending-it should have ended about 200 pages earlier-I wanted to start a bon fire and burn the book in protest for wasting my time.
6304779607|4.0|When Stallone was making \\"Cobra\\" he was at the top of his game. He was just coming off of making \\"Rocky 4\\" and \\"Rambo: First Blood part 2\\". Stallone had great intentions while making \\"Cobra\\", in fact there was even a sequel planed for the film. The sequel never was made, due to mixed reviews.    \\"Cobra\\" is about Lieutenant Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti, (Stallone) he works on the \\"zombie squad\\", where he does all the jobs that nobody wants to do. He knows all the bad guys in town.  Cobra is assigned to the case of bringing down the \\"night slashers\\". While the night slashers are out and about one night, Ingrid, a model (Brigitte Nielsen) was driving home from work and witnesses the night slashers committing a murder.  Now, after seeing the night slashers face, Ingrid is in great danger, so she is put under the protection of Cobra and his partner Sergeant Gonzales.    \\"Cobra\\" is a very good 80's action film. Stallone did a good job acting and writing the screen-play for the film.   If you are a fan of 80's action films or Sylvester Stallone you should greatly enjoy this film.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Works wonderfully for short and medium periods of time. If you're using it for more than a few hours straight for a marathon gaming session you might need to take a few breaks and hang it around your neck, but other than that this headset is VERY comfortable and the mic and sound quality is great! The price makes this an instant buy for anyone looking for a good headset!
6304698690|5.0|As a third grade teacher in an inner city, I wanted to give my students the opportunity to view this classic. My desire to show it was tempered by the knowledge that my all-Hispanic class would be put off by English accents and costumes that are as far from their experience as can be. I was pleasantly surprise as all of them sat in rapt attention throughout the entire movie. Their review is better than mine - the best movie experience that they have ever had. Jennifer wants me to tell you that it was superb (we're working on tier two words.)
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Most vampire movies these days are terrible. They've swapped out the terror for the bedroom tease and gone about defanging the monster into an emo person with long canines. Such things give me strange twitches and thoughts of doing things that no one expects on their whiny butts. Like the Spanish Inquisition. With the dishwashing rack. And a spoon.    Then there are those that actually remind you that yes, this is a monster that can eat you and not feel particularly bad about it. The idea of friendship around this kind of vampire gives a certain kind of uneasiness about the stability of the human involved. Let the Right One In is an example of this sort of horror.    Oskar is a misfit in his life, lonely and bullied at school. Eli moves in next door with her \\"father.\\" There's a string of murders and attempted murders that Eli's \\"father\\" has been committing to keep her fed. In the middle of that mess she and Oskar start talking and become friends.    I can honestly say that I am dumbfounded by the number of things to get uncomfortable over. Oskar's incipient necrophilia... Eli's \\"father's\\" pseudo-pedophilia... Eli's pseudo-pedophilia...  Now take into account that the film is eerily quiet for the most part and most of the attacks are are done as very long shots, with the action taking up just small part of the frame. Nothing quite like a feeling of cinematic isolation to give someone the creeps. Even most of the attacks are shot from a distance away, probably to emphasize the outsider themes running through the film. Neither Eli or Oskar really have friends. Then there's the detail that Eli starts encouraging Oskar to hurt and get back at the bullies after she sees him pretending to confront them with a knife. It would be a very \\"stand up for yourself\\" moment... if I could shake the suspicion that she was checking him out as a replacement for her decoy dad.    This film is somewhat slower paced than some may like in their vampire movie. I found that the slower storypace worked as a means to give the audience time to get distinctly uncomfortable. The attacks are unheralded by non-diagetic music and further supports a feeling of unease and uncertainty. It's rather amazing how well, just having a quiet film lends a sense of apprehension to the story. There aren't going to be any clues for the audience that Eli is going to attack someone as soon as they turn a corner. There's nothing really to prepare for the scene with the bullies in natatorium. I enjoyed the degree of care that went into keeping the suspense going throughout this film.    Curiously the film became more disquieting the more I thought about it later. It took time for some of the themes to percolate through. I think that's the mark of a really good horror film.
B000MV8ZD6|3.0|just a quick jab at a movie i do like. i love fulci , i love gore, i even love odd plots, but this movie is mediocre  in all columns.to say it is a great movie is insulting considering the offerings from the same director we've all grown to love.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I was worried about not seeing results because I didnt really need to lose much weight (~10 lbs) and we've all heard \\"It's the last 10 lbs that are the hardest to lose\\".  I mostly just wanted to try to tone up a flabby midsection from having two children (and sheer laziness). Jillian Michaels and the 30 Day Shred were recommended to me so I decided to give it a try.     I am in my 4th week right now of working out 4-5 days a week and I'm very happy with the results so far. I've lost about 4 lbs, but the real testament is in the inches I've lost- 2\\" off my waist, 1\\" off my hips and 1/2\\" off my arms in just 3 weeks. I look and feel DIFFERENT in a short amount of time. My clothes fit so much better and I'm much stronger.     For full disclosure, about 2 weeks into my workouts I also added Jillian's \\"No More Trouble Zones\\" and alternate that with the 30DS. The Shred is definitely a complete workout in itself, but I was looking for more variety. I found it with Jillian Michaels. I'm sold.
0446563048|5.0|Delivering Happiness       Tony Hsieh (pronounced Shay) of [...] (recently acquired by Amazon.com for 1.2 billion ) was gracious enough to send some bloggers an advance copy of Delivering Happiness (and a copy to give to one of their readers!) in exchange for an honest review on their blogs.  The book was released the ten days ago , and it is currently #1 on the NYT bestseller list.  Here is my review.      For me, there were two parts of the book:  the first two chapters and the rest.  The book started with a 6.5 and finished with a 9.0 (out of 10.0) As an entrepreneur who doesn't know what he's doing, I was inspired by this entrepreneur who obviously does.       The beginning of the book is about the different money-making ideas Tony put to the test when he was younger -- from starting a worm farm to selling pizza in his university cafeteria and eventually working with [...]  A few of  the ideas were absolutely failures, some were barely successful, and some were really sucessful.   The first couple chapters almost have too much of a conversational tone, and he often digresses and gives us \\"funny\\" anecdotes that aren't that funny, similar to what you get when talking to me.  What you do get from these first couple of chapters is an honesty and the impression he's simply a good guy who is trying to teach and entertain at the same time.       Despite the humor that often fell flat, I found myself inspired in the first part after reading the first few pages.  The ideas he had as a young adult to make money were suprisingly very simple and some of them worked. He simply shrugged off the experiences that were complete failures. They were not something he dwelled on, but similar to when you find your favorite restaurant with a huge wait, he simply tried something different.  It sucks, but no big deal.      The first part also includes the story about how Zappos began with one man (actually NOT Tony) and grew to the behemoth it is today.  How in the beginning they would\\"just throw ideas against the wall to see if they'd stick, improvise, and make it happen\\".  How the company wasn't making any money and Tony had the few employees left move into his condo and stay rent-free to avoid closing the doors on their idea.  It goes on...    The next two-thirds of the book are about his career at [...] once they were finally in a comfortable position and is where the book really took off.  This is where we see less \\"Friend Tony\\" with a conversational tone and more \\"Business Tony.\\"  There are a lot of guest authors in this portion -- business partners of his and employees at [...] who helped build [...] into what it is today. He cut and pasted dozens of  emails from these people so we can see how things went down.  I finished the book wanting to be both an employee at [...] and customer there.      The \\"second part\\" talks about how they turned their focus to customer service at a particular critical point in the history, after they had just laid of 50% of their employees. The process of delivering excellent customer service starts with creating a happy corporate culture, he says -- one based on principles everyone agrees on.      All of the ideas are really unique and courageous and you'll have to read the book to find out what they are.  Most of us have heard about a few of them:  how he pays employees $2000 to quit anytime in their first month to ensure he gets people who really buy into what they are doing there, how his customers are shipped and can return their shoes for free, how they have 365 days to return said shoes.   Other things most don't know about : Collectively with every single one of his employees, he compiled a list of principles that are important to the company.  He hires and fires using this list.  There are a number of people [...] haven't hired because they didn't fit the \\"Be humble\\" , \\"Create Fun and a Little Weirdness\\", or other [...] principles that shape their company culture --  people who had the credentials to make an immediate positive impact on their bottom line.  But because they wouldn't strenghten the culture, and thus hurt the brand in the long run, they decided not to hire them.     The value of Zappos that I really embrace is \\"Pursue Growth and Learning\\", and they offer courses for their employees such as Leadership Essentials and Science of Happiness 101, which you can take and receive incremental increases in your salary for completing each one.        Here are Zappos' core values.  If you would like to receive their culture book, a book all of the employees put together about the culture they work to maintain, email [...] and include a mailing address.       Two stories I particularly liked:  A customer wrote an email about an experience he had with a online customer service rep and copied the transcipt of the conversatoiin HERE    It illustrates their drive to \\"bring a little weirdness\\" to work everyday.   He also talks about being out of town one night with a friend, and the friend wanted pizza at a very late hour.  Tony playfully suggested that his friend call [...] customer service (a online shoe retailer, mind you) to see if they would help.  His friend took him up on the suggestion, the customer rep put him on hold, and came back with a list of pizza places that were still open and delivering at that time --something the customer rep did without knowing Tony was sitting in the background on the other end of the phone.      The book is a very courageous endeavor because it is a completely transparent look at how the company is run.  It's not something you see very much today, but I can guarantee you will see a lot of in the future.         The main message of the book is the strongest companies today are those who embrace strengthening company culture and priciples, and in the process strengthen their service to customers.  Happy employees beget happy customers.  Happy customers spread the word about their experience and the influence of the company grows,benefitting everyone along the way.
B00004OCQ2|4.0|\\"Dusk\\" representa el trabajo final de Ray Gillen con este grupo, simplemente uno de los mejores vocalistas del Hard Rock de finales de la d&eacute;cada de los 80 y principio de los 90, quien lamentablemente falleci&oacute; poco tiempo despu&eacute;s de haber grabado estas canciones (Diciembre 1993), justo cuando comenzaba el nuevo proyecto \\"Sun Red Sun\\" con Bobby Rondinelli.<br />Sin ser un lanzamiento formal, \\"Dusk\\" representa la esencia de la banda con ese estilo bluesy, con similitudes a \\"Led Zeppelin\\" en su sonido, un gran guitarrista como Jake E. Lee que siempre luce un estilo propio, pirot&eacute;cnico el cual lleva el peso de las canciones acompa&ntilde;ado por la voz &uacute;nica de Gillen. Sin destacar ning&uacute;n tema, se trata de una grabaci&oacute;n pr&aacute;cticamente en vivo de una banda que pudo ser m&aacute;s grande y que naci&oacute; dentro de la era dorada de los llamados \\"supergrupos\\" de finales de los 80, pero dej&oacute; un grato sabor de boca por su calidad interpretativa.
032147404X|3.0|I bought this book for my dad, and wondered why he never used it until I picked it up.  It's got some good photographic tips in it on some of the common features on DSLR's, but the content isn't that well organized (arranged by genre rather than by technique) and on each page you've got to filter through a couple of paragraphs of unfunny jokes to get to the point.  A lot of the advice is prescriptive, i.e. it tells you how to create formulaic shots rather than understand the principles of photography so that you can innovate.  For amateur photographers trying to make some money or feel out different types of photography before investing in equipment, this book could work.  However, if you want a quick guide to creating visual effects this book requires a lot of sifting, and if you want something to provide perspective on taking more original photos, it won't help.
B00362DRNG|1.0|For anyone wanting to read a multitude of honest reviews of this product, rather than all of this nonsensical blind praise listed here, please read the reviews at Amazon's UK site.    The \\"remastering\\" on the two latest DD releases is terrible! The remastering engineer turned the volume WAY TOO LOUD, creating heavy compression and severe distortion. It's resulted in an all around unpleasant listening experience. This has become too common place among CD reissues, especially over the past several years. The \\"Loudness War\\", as it is termed, is the result of the iPod generation. The labels, and sometimes the artists (who may not necessarily know the downfalls of their request), want their songs to POP from the speakers when in shuffle mode or added to a playlist, so the result is the volume on CD's gets louder and louder. Of course, this is at the sacrifice of the dynamics and definition of the original music. EMI are already in financial turmoil, and the negative reviews of their products are not going to do anything to help their sinking ship stay afloat.     Some artists go out of their way to ensure their CD's do not suffer from the pitfalls of the loudness war. Thomas Dolby posted a message during the remastering of his first two albums to inform concerned fans that he was going to ensure the dynamics of his music remained. The result was two stunning remasters of his classic albums.     Alan Wilder oversaw the remastering of the Depeche Mode back catalog, and as a result none of those albums were compressed, and most were completely satisfying to fans. If these labels are blasting their music for the sake of standing out on an iPod, then release a CD with proper dynamics, then turn up the music another 100 decibels for the MP3's that you make available on iTunes or other download sites. That way everyone wins. This overblown volume and distortion/destruction of music has got to stop.    UPDATE: EMI have recently responded to the loads of negative comments regarding these two reissues. The only thing they admit fault on was the damaged intro to 'Girls on Film'. They blame a damaged tape, but anyone with an ounce of simple home PC audio software experience can tell you a glitch like this can be fixed in seconds. What's worse is EMI mention nothing about the overblown volume, distortion, and generally terrible sound quality, and state they do not intend to rectify any of the problems. Funny, but I don't recall a single negative review about the sound quality of the original DD CD's from the 80's. It's pretty bad when a CD mastered 20 years ago sounds worlds better than a CD done today. Great job EMI. Just another hole in your already sinking ship.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Let me say right off the bat that I believe 'Batman Begins' is definitely a superior movie. The deal here is that this movie is one of the main reasons I bought a brand new HD TV. I was walking through a Sears store in the television department and there was an excerpt of the chase scene being shown.  I was blown away by the colors I saw! I thought to myself, \\"I've got to update my audio-video game, ASAP!\\"  All in all this is a blu-ray must.

B002R68U7K|5.0|I always wanted her singles and finally I got it!    The deluxe edition is amazing! Not only the songs and b-sides, but the good quality of the material of the box!    I was sad that in the DVD it didn't had the music video of \\"Overprotected\\" (it had the Darkchild remix instead, but it should had both), \\"Boys (The Co-Ed Remix feat. Pharrell Williams)\\" and the most wanted \\"3\\"! And I thought that the menu was cheap, and it didn't had the CD with the songs of the collection. I thought it would have one...    Anyway, this won't stop me to rate 5 stars, 'cause I loved it so much! Like I said before, the qualities of the songs and the material are awesome!    If you're a huge Britney fan, you SHOULD buy it!
B002TZW4JY|4.0|Since it's their \\"last\\" album, barring charity events, World Cup Football performances, 35 year reunions ... well, you get the drift, I justified paying a little more. Fans will always pay more for the \\"final\\" album. The package is a quality, double-fold opening cardboard Digipak from Europe (Germany, specifically). Why all CD's don't come this way is a mystery to me - the tactile quality of the product makes it somehow more rewarding to own. Two-disc set: one CD and one DVD, which is Region 0, and therefore plays in any machine in the world (as long as that machine plays PAL video, which this is, being German).   The DVD is the three theatrical videos from the album, plus two live videos from some 2009 concerts.   The CD is a solid final effort, no where near as good as Scoundrel Days, but more accessible than Memorial Beach - so, the boys go out on a \\"high\\" note with this release and package.   Sadly, at $36, it's about $16 more than you'd pay if it were released domestically, which, as all North American a-ha fans know, was always a sore point.   Nice quality booklet and liner notes as well.
0743454537|1.0|Other commenters have said it as well as I could -- a pretty interesting premise, starts off somewhat interesting, and completely degenerates by the end.  I hate cliches (couldn't believe Picoult incorporated several jokes into the story as though they were original to her characters, like the one about drinking apple juice from a bedpan, I heard that from my dad when I was a kid); I hate having my emotions manipulated -- and so badly! -- and I especially hate stories which  justify women and girls being sacrificed for the well-being of others (think Breaking the Waves ).  The plot holes and throwaway characters in this book are amazing -- what happens to Jesse?  What about Sara's sister Suzanne?  They just disappear by the end like they didn't even matter, which they didn't.  If the author cares that little about her characters, how is the reader supposed to care?    If you like well-rounded characters, complex plots, and nuanced explorations of serious philosophical and ethical issues -- skip this book.  If you like soap operas, you'll love it.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This is one of the best CD's ever!  I love this group.   It is pleasant music to listen to and I look forward to their next release!
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|This movie is only somewhat entertaining, but because the storytelling is easy to follow and has its moments, I choose to give it an overall rating of 4 out of 5, as opposed to a 3 (which is what I was originally planning to give it).    Kate Winslet's character as a woman who appears calm and rational on the surface but secretly guilty of a huge horrible secret is definitely the highlight of the film.      Basically the story is divided into two segments- the first half being Kate's character falling in love with a boy much younger than she is, and the second half devoted to lengthy courtroom scenes.      The first half is somewhat unsettling to watch because whenever Kate's character and the boy she's sleeping with get together, the two of them  constantly \\"go at it\\" in bed, and it's honestly hard to watch because the boy feels WAY too young for her.    The ending is pretty good.  Actually both segments that end the film are good.  It should be noted that despite the German accents the characters are speaking, the language spoken is in English, so you don't have to worry about reading subtitles at the bottom of the screen.

B00005K3NR|5.0|I've always loved Stephen King films for his highly unusual writing talent and for the way he always delivers unexpected and bizarre twists, but I *completely* forgot how much I love Carrie!    I haven't seen this movie in quite a long time.  In fact, it must have been 20 years since I last watched it.  I completely forgot what it was about.    Carrie is the name of a teenage girl who has special powers- she has the ability to move objects with her mind.  Her character is that she *constantly* gets picked on by all the girls in her gym class.  They do some of the most revulting things imaginable to her.    Furthermore, her mother believes she is evil, so she constantly tries to save her daughter whenever the girl returns home from school by reading from the Bible, screaming in her daughters face that she's sinful, and other ways.      Basically, the girl has a bad life, haha.  But... what goes around comes around, eh?    The majority of the storyline focuses on the senior prom dance, and what will happen when Carrie gets invited.  Well I know one thing- her mother won't be happy about it, haha.  This is when Carrie REALLY takes advantage of her special powers.  She takes absolutely no crap from anyone, let's put it that way.    There are some unintentionally funny moments throughout the film, such as when the head girl in her gym class gets smacked around by her gym teacher and her boyfriend.  It's because she doesn't know when to shut up, haha.  She's *always* getting smacked around by someone.    John Travolta... WOW he looks young, haha.  With long black hair, too.  Surprising to see this.  I didn't even recognize him at first.    Another interesting thing about the film is how Carrie becomes close to her gym teacher because she's the only one who understands how much Carrie is being picked on by her classmates.   However, it's very surprising what happens to the gym teacher eventually.      Also, try to imagine school teachers acting the way they do in this filmTHESE days, haha.  Hard to imagine.    This film is just really cool.  It contains a really weird storyline, solid characters, and establishes Stephen King as a really good writer.

1579128149|5.0|This book looks at the elements, with illustrations (whenever possible) of it in its pure (or natural form) and in applications. Don't expect to see Einsteinium or Californium but the comments by the author about the elements, their respective traits and humorous asides about this or that make it an easy book to read.
B002QN7PU2|3.0|Dexter Season 4 Review    For the most part, the Dexter series is perfect television that displays a perfect balance between quality and technique: at times, season four makes you wonder if all of that has changed.    On the plus side of things, John Lithgow is a great actor who gives a seamlessly creepy and pleasantly nuanced performance as Dexter's opponent. Some of his scenes (especially the ones in which Lithgow reveals his character's meticulously concealed insanity) are amazing to watch: scenes so good that they remind you that acting is a craft and that it is possible for an actor to be amazing at it.    In a strong departure from the earlier seasons, season four sees the writers trying to establish a longer-term change in the love-lives of a couple of the characters instead of the previous season's twelve-episodes-and-out shacking up. Unfortunately, this doesn't make up for all the things in season four that make you roll your eyes.    On the minus side, the complications that arise from Dexter's family life stretch credulity to the breaking point and beyond--a situation that is made obvious when several different characters call attention to how much time Dexter, the family man with an office job, spends in places where no one can find him day or night.    Dexter's wife, Rita, whom the writers have made a fiercely independent woman who puts great energy into her children and her marriage, becomes unsupportably unpleasant at times--at times almost shrewish--when she reacts to Dexter's unavoidable furtiveness and need for evasion. Unfortunately, this removes much of the emotional value from one element of season four's resolution.    Dexter worked in those first three seasons. Despite its dependence on a formula as contrived as a television sitcom's, Dexter has been bullet proof entertainment until now and it makes you wonder if the it's the writers who have run out of steam or if the original idea is just too thin to allow for stronger and more nuanced writing.    Watching the first three seasons of Dexter, things never became so strange that you threw your hands in the air and walked away regardless of how contrived the scripts were, or how much yoga the writers had to do to fit a compelling resolution into the show's formulas. It was what was good about the series's writing: its technique was never so bad that you saw that it was technique; nor was it so bad that you saw that the technique was missing. In season four, with it reliance on melodrama and increasingly wild coincidence, both those problems are present and noticeable.    One of the great things about the Dexter TV series is that even when the season's resolution is as strange as this season's is, you still want more of it, Dexter is an engaging character as are the people around him, but season four leaves you with a strange taste in your mouth--like weak tea and Tequila: at best the result is an acquired taste--one that makes you wonder if you will like the next season.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|My initial Princess and the Frog DVD was broken (it wouldn't play).  However, Amazon quickly resolved the problem by sending me another DVD.<br /><br />This is Disney's first African American princess; thus I had to add it to my movie collection.  The movie premise follows the same Disney formula of  smart, strong-willed heroines who finds and falls in love with guy after several mishaps...happy ending.  As I said this is Disney's first African American princess, which hopefully serves as a role model for young black girls.
B001HN69AY|4.0|HEATH LEDGER's sudden demise during filming of THE IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS made it necessary to change the script so that his unfinished scenes could be played by other actors within the realm of the crazy world of the Imaginarium. This clever adjustment to the script provides three other actors with fill-in roles for Ledger: JOHNNY DEPP, JUDE LAW and COLIN FARRELL.<br /><br />Heath is a complete delight in his role as the mysterious stranger who comes upon the traveling sideshow and has the power to change everything. CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER is a marvel in the title role as the 1,000 year-old man who has sold his soul to the Devil and must turn over his daughter to Mr. Nick (TOM WAITS) on the occasion of her sixteenth birthday. Newcomers ANDREW GARFIELD and LILY COLE are well cast as performers in the troupe.<br /><br />All of it is filled with wondrous sets, gorgeous costumes, and an abundant sense of good humor. Everyone in the cast seems to be having fun with their roles, particularly Heath Ledger. I dare say that if he had lived to complete his role, it may well have garnered another nomination for him.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam has directed with a firm grasp of tongue-in-cheek fantasy and made a vastly entertaining film out out of a slim storyline. Whether you respond to it or not will depend entirely on your taste. It's totally bizarre but fascinating.

B003KRJNBW|5.0|The Book of Eli is a fascinating experience into a post-apocalyptic world where violence and cannibalism is commonplace. In this film, Denzel Washington pulls off another great performance. Gary Oldman is downright entertaining and of course never disappointing. Their performances were undeniably compelling. The Hughes Brothers did an exceptional job with the fight scenes. Oh, and I cannot forget the cinematography - WOW!  The cinematography was simply breathtaking!
B00009W0U4|5.0|Was that the beginning? Was that the end? What the hell? Well, I will tell you what I saw. This film runs in reverse, the credits are in reverse, it's all backwards. Yes, you see the end first and the beginning at the end. Confused? Don't be, it's not too hard to follow when you are watching the film, especially if you are expecting it. This, by no means, will ruin any part of the movie for the first time viewer either. About the story, I can still remember, very vividly, this entire film. It left an impression on my twisted, numbed, De-sensitized mind (Believe me, that's saying something!). This film will just about p*ss you off (rape/revenge, baby!) and then leave the viewer staring in utter shock! A few very brutal, brutal scenes here!!! Not to mention the hermaphrodite, Whoa! Man!<br /><br />I will not get into any specific details about the shock scenes that unfold, but will WARN you that this hits like a Louisville slugger to the back of the head!(Don't want to give anything away.)<br /><br />Anyone that's interested in a little shock cinema and doesn't mind subtitles, must and I repeat, MUST preview this film! This is foreign (FRENCH), NOT a low budget flick and I guarantee you have never come across anything like it. Brilliant, original, repulsive and positively sickening!!!<br /><br />Good luck and I can only hope that your viewing experience is as memorable and exhausting as mine was!
B003GEDLW6|5.0|From start to finish, Immersion is a phantasmagoria of beats, sounds, and rhythms that acoustically transport you to another world. The soundstage (that is, how surrounding-sounding something sounds) on Immersion is incredible, which is part of why I say it pulls you in and transports you.<br /><br />The opening track, Genesis, starts the album off with a very cinematic feeling. It quickly builds into a climax before collapsing into Salt in the Wounds. This second track builds itself up with layer upon layer of drums, bass, and a whole myriad of electronic sounds. It's an amazing, rocking track that makes you feel ready to dance, fight, run, and take on anything! Watercolour is next, and is without a doubt one of the most uplifting songs I've ever had the joy of listening too. It is also the first track with vocals, and Rob Swire does an amazing job. Set Me On Fire is next, and is a high-energy song with startlingly intense breakdowns. Crush keeps the pace going, and makes a fantastic driving song that you just HAVE to sing along to! Under the Waves, while less frantic, has an ocean-y and organic sound to it. Immunize is in direct contrast, with a more mechanical sound. Midway through the album we come to the concept tracks The Island, Part 1 (Dawn) and The Island, Part 2 (Dusk). The first has a somber, driving beat with dramatic vocals, while part 2 mixes things up with a cataclysm of techno sounds in place of most of the vocals. Comprachiros, like the other reviewer mentioned, has a definite NIN feel to it, with whispered vocals and a more industrial sound. This is where I have to say the variety Pendulum has is simply incredible. Without ever sounding forced, they incorporate so many styles of dance, dnb, industrial, rock, house, and more into their music. Next we come to The Vulture, another song that simply refuses to let you listen without dancing. Following The Vulture we are treated to Witchcraft, which incorporates more beautiful vocals and moving instrumentation. Next we come to 2 tracks with guest musicians. First is Self Vs Self with In Flames, a rocking metal song that, while you definitely do NOT see coming, is amazing and certainly adds to the mixture this album presents. Then comes the reason I first heard of this album, The Fountain with Steven Wilson of the progressive rock band Porcupine Tree. This is a beautiful, nostalgic sounding track that will make you wonder if you should get up and dance, stare out a window in thought, or both! Steven's vocals are, as always, incredible, and lead perfectly into the finale of the album, Encoder. Encoder serves as a the antithesis to Salt in the Wounds. It ends the album with a moaning guitar, soft acoustic chords, and finally the crashing of waves on the shore.<br /><br />If you enjoy music in ANY capacity, you owe it to yourself to give Pendulum's Immersion a listen. A+, album of the year, gold star, everything.Next we come to 2 tracks with guest musicians.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|A lovely film showing what can happen when passion, talent and position all come together in the same place. This movie is currently on Netflix instant queue. Watch it
0312330537|3.0|I don't know that I've ever read a book that was so enthralling, and yet with so much terrible writing in it. Knowing it's semi-autobiographical is the driving force in the effort to read the entire thing. When Roberts writes what he clearly knows, the book soars (and a reader has to admit, his life, if this is what it was, was extraordinary by any measure). The writing is clean, direct, and immensely vivid. His affection for the people of Bombay comes through so clearly in the writing that the reader falls in love with them too. I could see Bombay in a way I've never seen it before, or cared to, truthfully. I was completely absorbed in those passages. But Roberts can't write a heterosexual love story to save his life. The women depicted here never come across as real, and the handful of love scenes are written horribly, as if he just wanted to get them over with. The renderings of the male friendships, though, are written with such heart, so authentically, that you just keep turning the pages to be in the company of these men. As has been stated many times in these reviews, there's some truly humiliating prose in this book -- sometimes it's almost as if it was written by two different writers -- one who can write about India and Afghanistan and politics and the care of the poor in the slums of Bombay, with a skill that is artful and impassioned -- and the other, the one who can't write about sex or love or spiritual lessons without the most embarrassing, flowery, ridiculous prose. An editor needs to tell Roberts to please please stop with the hyphenated-adjectives. They make him sound like a high school English major. The book is sprawling, the narrative disjointed and frustrating -- episodic, I suppose, because his life is episodic, and his editor decided not to shape the book, but instead allowed Roberts to just tell his mind-boggling story -- but still, how many readers complained out loud when he unceremoniously kills off a favorite character simply to turn theplot in another direction? I nearly quit the book then, over 600 pages in, but I felt too commited by that point. There's so much good here, and so much bad, but in the end I feel the good wins out. I'm glad I read the book. But do yourself a favor and just skip the silly parts, you won't miss anything.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|A fan of Pride and Prejudice may be reeled in by the quirky description of this movie, but do not be fooled. Anyone one who claims to love the story as much as the main character does would not allow the foibles to take place. Jane and Collins get married???  If she were as big a fan as she claims to be she would have taken a bullet before that happened. The first half of the movie I enjoyed it but then it goes quickly downhill. Send Elizabeth back, have Michael make a proposal scene worth her acceptance, but please oh please don't make another movie like this one.
B003OBZV60|5.0|I'm hardly the first to praise Mankell for his Wallander series, but this one I found especially compelling.  Mankell has done a marvelous job of placing us so close to Wallander that we experience the confusion and fear as he tries to unravel a mystery that takes him to Riga, Latvia as the Soviet system is imploding after 50 years.  Like Wallander, we are always just a bit off balance, uncertain of where we are, what is happening, and why events are as they are.  At the heart of the mystery is not so much an action or series of actions but an inability to sort friends and foes and the confusion and fear that permeate a disintegrating totalitarian state.  It reminds me of Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon,\\" and in fact, one of the characters echoes a central theme of Darkness.  So if you like the gun-toting, bourbon swilling hard-nosed dick who can give or take a beating, don't bother with this book.
0316010669|1.0|Blink by Malcolm Gladwell: just seems to be a collection of ideas or small conversations, meaningless in themselves.

0765348276|5.0|John Perry joins the army on his 75th birthday after a quiet life as an advertising copy writer in middle America. He and his wife had both signed the Intent to Join ten years previously and had a few standard medical tests but it wasn't binding. Now, with Kathy long dead and an adult son who no longer needs him, Perry feels like joining the army is a pretty good idea. They'll make him younger, able to fight - and when your body's failing you that sounds pretty damn tempting - and after five years, maybe ten, he'll be cut loose, still young, and with a whole new life to lead.    All he has to do is accept he'll never see Earth again.    The army in question is the Colonial Defense Force, mankind's only front in an ongoing interstellar game of tug with hundreds of other alien races. It seems that there are only limited number of planets available for colonization out there, and there aren't many races inclined to share.    Old Man's War follows Perry as he receives a fantastic new body grown from the DNA taken from him ten years before, goes through basic training, and is thrown into combat. Anchored by Perry's dry wit, the book is by turns funny, sad and horrific as he discovers that going to war against aliens isn't all it's cracked up to be when you and your friends have a survival rate of less than 25%. And as Perry progresses through the ranks, he comes to question the wisdom of the CDF's strategy - especially when he encounters a Special Forces soldier who bears a striking resemblance to his late wife; just who are the Ghost Brigade anyway?    John Scalzi's first entry into his popular series of books is, to put it bluntly, great. I don't want to say it's rip-roaring because that sounds a little hyperbolic, but it IS rip-roaring. It's fast paced, well-written with sharp characterization, an engaging narrative and plenty of twists. It's got enough SCIENCE! to keep harder sci-fi readers interested without overwhelming more casual sci-fi readers like me.    Plus,it has a scene with a battle between humans and tiny Lilliputian-type aliens which involves lots of stomping - and while that sounds inherently funny, it's actually a scene where the futility of it all really hits Perry.    For people who enjoy science-fiction, even casually, I really can't recommend this enough.
B00007KQA3|5.0|I tried the old, cheaper videocassette and the picture was terrible. Playback has degraded with time. Get the DVD and see 1984 in all its grim glory. It's a worthwhile complement to the book. When you`re finished, share it.  We have a duty to pass the torch!

0312330537|5.0|This book is a perfect summer read.  It has everything: adventure, mystery, love, crime, friendship, passion, suffering, etc...  It is a long book, but I love that about a a book.  It is easy to get caught up in all the characters.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Wonderful animation, voice acting - brilliant performance by Ed Asner who always does a good job.  Charming to the max.  The first four minutes - a synoptic life of the happy couple beginning to end is worth the price of admission all by itself, and it is nearly silent film.  Funny, warm and involving.  I like it much better than the stale old plot and over-budget horse manure of Cameron's smelly beached whale the Avatar. Uplifting without moralizing, fun without mindless nonstop action and noise.  This is a film for all ages and most tastes.
0385337388|4.0|At first, I was disappointed with the book. It was a little too soft-porn at times with the sex going on in the hospital. Then, that kind of died down and I was able to read the book for what it is: the truth about medicine and the ridiculousness of what really goes on in a hospital. I'm not a doctor, but as a nurse, I see how much of this is true. It's a well-written book and I think this author was ahead of his time by coming out and speaking about what goes on. I've seen others compare this book to 'Catch-22' and I agree in some ways. It does speak about the insanity that runs rampant in the bureaucracies that run organizations, whether it be a hospital or the military. A theme in 'Catch-22' is, \\"The only way to survive such an insane system is to be insane oneself.\\" This is also seen throughout 'The House of God.' Good book that I would recommend, especially to those in the healthcare field. I plan on reading the sequel, 'Mount Misery,' as well.
142313494X|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but I do teach, and the kids have been reading this in my classroom (it got my attention). I read a lot of kid's books just to keep up with them, and often the books are shallow, or about what you would expect a third grader to find thrilling (but pretty boring for adults). I was pleasantly surprised by this novel, and I ran right out to order the rest of the series! I've always been a nut about Greco-Roman mythology, and found this book to be \\"right on\\" with the knowledge and research, the mythology, and the approach. It is also completely modernised for our \\"persnickity\\" young people. Rather than comparing it to Harry Potter, I would more compare the writing style to Diane Wynn Jones (another excellent modern fantasy writer). I give it about 10 thumbs up!
B002ZG98VE|4.0|When I first saw the previews for this movie, I wasn't interested. I don't know -something about the grotesque violence, Russell Crowe (who I am not a fan of) and the apparent absence of Robin Hood's quintessential robbing from the rich and giving to the poor made me wonder how on earth this could even be a Robin Hood movie. But after some close friends kept raving about how much they enjoyed it, I thought I'd give the Crowe/Ridley Scott Gladiator team a try and I found that I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.    We meet the famous Robin Hood as a nothing archer in King Richard the Lionheart's army (known as Robin what-the-heck Longstride). After the king is killed in battle, Robin and his band of archer friends decide to disguise themselves as knights and travel back to England with news of the King's death. Before they can leave, though, a dying knight named Robert Loxely asks Robin to take his sword back to his father in Nottingham -Robin agrees. Once they arrive in England, John is crowned as king and Robin takes the sword to Loxley's father, who decides to pretend that Robin is his son returning from the Crusades. Not only does Robin suddenly finds himself a noble (and later a freedom fighter), but also the husband of Robert's wife, Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett).    The plot, once we get into it, is really interesting and well put-together, though with a few hiccups. The main issue I had was the lack of Robin stealing from the rich and giving to the poor -I know that seems so single-minded, but with a legend that's so embedded in our culture as doing these acts its so hard to think of him otherwise. I also kept in mind that this movie is meant to be an origin story and the entire thing does build up Robin's motivations for re-distributing wealth and develops interesting characters while setting the stage for Robin's future exploits.    Perhaps the easiest way for me to get over this is thinking of it as more of a medieval war movie than a Robin Hood movie. With this mentality, it's a well-done film, but with some violence that feels over-the-top and unneeded and may have gone on just a little too long. But honestly, I think this film doesn't get enough credit -you just have to get past the Robin Hood stereotype and be open to a different idea of the legend.
1567184855|3.0|Haven't been able to finish yet, because more complicated to understand than I thought it would be.
0345457684|3.0|Enjoyed the detail but a couple of major plot holes made the whole story fall apart big time. As in, it made absolutely, completely no sense once you find them. But they're not completely obvious, so perhaps you'll miss them, or perhaps you don't mind plot holes so much if the action is good. And the action was certainly good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Way back when, I saw only a few episodes and had wished to have seen more.    (FOX changed the schedule, then canceled, yada yada, there should be many discussions on the web about this)   I did buy it on sale elsewhere and the dvd was only available. I figured since it was filmed for TV a few years ago that the BLURAY wasn't really required. It looked great on my 32\\" LCD and I'll lend it to my friends who haven't gone to bluray anyway.    ... The \\"Firefly\\" series was great. The western (cowboy frontier) influence and 9 characters each with very human complications, makes this a refreshing venture into space and not just a SCI-FI cookie cutter show. It has good initial character development and enough to be satisfied even though they didn't get to make a 2nd season. Make sure to watch the extras and commentaries when your done. I'm kinda techy, work in the aviation industry, and love the ship design and layout.     I haven't seen the movie \\"Serenity\\", but episode 1 is 2 parts and named 'serenity'.   FOX started with episode 3 or 4 to grab viewers with a couple of the action episodes, and didn't air the first. So, I don't think I'll need to get the movie.    There are some 'adult situations' so I won't let my pre-teen daughters watch. But I highly recommend this for several hours of enjoyment. It should have been given several seasons like other groundbreaking shows as X-Files, LOST, 24, ...
0385342039|2.0|Said I was finished with chick lit, but then I went on vacation and broke my vow. Even though I liked Kinsella's Can You Keep A Secret and The Undomestic Goddess, I couldn't read her shopaholic stuff because shoppers give me the hives. This book didn't work for me in the beginning -- I would have dumped it had I had anything else to read that seemed promising -- but kicked in a bit after midway. In general I'm finding a LOT of books today are simply too long. Four stars for the last 200 pages and 1 star for the first 200. When the good stuff kicks in, it's quite charming -- a semi-dizzy 20-something in contemporary London teams up with the ghost of her semi-dizzy flapper great-aunt from 1920s London to solve a mystery with fun and romance along the way.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I ordered this pretty much exclusively to play SSBB competitively. It arrived quickly, and I was surprised by the length of the cord; the cord really gives you the option of not sitting in lasic surgery range of the TV while playing.<br /><br />The controller works smoothly and responds well. For Brawl, I removed the springs in the shoulder buttons and the operation of them remains solid. I even sanded and painted the remote with good results.<br /><br />Overall, it's a name-brand remote... what do you expect? It's well worth the money to buy this over a knock-off brand that has cheaper internals and cuts corner on quality.

0441172717|5.0|Honestly , really truthfully honestly, this book is the best book i've EVER read i was shocked that up until this point.I thought i knew great authors i really did but i was wrong. it was like i had never read a book before it was like being blind had having someone discribe colors and then actually seeing the colors for the first time ... It's the first time i read a book where some one had a story, and  just really owned it, run with it and made you care.... And it wasn't absolutely unbelievable, impossable. I mean look the story is hot the story takes place tens of thousands of years in the future. the story chronicles the human race which has banned computers but developed advanced technology and mental and physical ablitites. everything is run with the consumption of melange (spice) which can if consumed enough make flyng ship travel with out moving and they can simply fold space and they are there. extend life. see into the future, see things. minus  the royality the witchs the mentats humans so logical and conditons they where biological computers able to amazing feets with their minds, along with all the political and social and scientific things. its all consuming. i'd often be stuck in pleace reading the book oblivious stuck in unknown spots just reading ... wondering at points where this author came up with this story... i mean he has stories within stories plots twists... he has dept that he follows threw like or as with realistic life senerios would happen  complete with all the little details. which he takes the actually time to tackle and write. i like how in his novel he speaks in that by the way there's this whole story that happened before the machine wars which you learn in qoutes and statements and remarks from people and books in the story... but this is what we are covering  now sense.  Every thing has its own history its own language along with amazing incredible quotes. He doesn't have chapters he has quotes. how hot is That are from histories or journals that  seem like they are outside sources seemingly like it is factual documents. you have to remind your self its a story. but you feel you have to tell your friends. Its crazy how even the last line of dune is inspiring. I love this book it is my favorite. And all the reviewers are right the only thing comparable to it is the lord of the rings with its rich and complete world.s or journals that  seem like they are outside sources seemingly like it is factual documents. you have to remind your self its a story. but you feel you have to tell your friends.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|I'm Glad I got this set, and although  the lack of music is noticeable on some episodes,  Daria  is a one off series I loved this when it was on TV  I have some episodes recorded from MTV with the original music but the quality of the DVD's is far superior.   This box set is a must for any fan   I would have liked some more extras though and I had to import it to the UK which took  4 weeks.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I had not read the previous books in this series, which I guess was a mistake. Unlike almost every author who writes a series, he made the beginning of this book almost impossible to comprehend. Other writers refer to previous characters or situations, but explain them so that a new reader is not perplexed by the plot. From the very beginning, it was difficult to make heads or tales out of what was going on, or who the many characters were.<br /><br />As to that, throughout the book there were so many different characters introduced, many with similar names, that even half way through the book it was almost impossible to remember who was who and what they did.<br /><br />Another really annoying part of the book was every time a character went anywhere: home, to a restaurant, to work, or trying to evade a possible follower, every single street that was taken had to be named. I suppose anybody living in Stockholm would recognize some of these, but the names were unpronounceable, did not add a single thing to the plot, and just added a huge amount of verbiage to an already confusing book. At the very least, the translator could easily have omitted the many paragraphs of these directions from the book without harming the plot at all.<br /><br />About a third of the way through the book, it began to become less confusing, and a bit more interesting, although none of the characters were at all sympathetic for me. When Salendar began playing around with her handheld computer, and contacting the other computer freaks on the 'Net, it was interesting. The goings on with Sapo were also interesting, as was the trial. However, all-in-all, she was a really annoying character. At the end, it became disgusting how she was living her sad life, with no purpose or redeeming aim.<br /><br />There was little or no humor in the book, and by the end I did not really like or empathize with any of the characters.<br /><br />I should have given up, but being stubborn, I wanted to see if it would not improve. I found the ending really dismal, violent and unpleasant.<br /><br />I guess if I could, I would rate the beginning and end with one star, and perhaps the middle third would merit three stars. I'm sorry I bought this book.lly dismal, violent and unpleasant.    I guess if I could, I would rate the beginning and end with one star, and perhaps the middle third would merit three stars.

030726999X|5.0|This was by far the easiest book to get into for me.  The second book, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" left off on a cliffhanger and I couldn't wait for the publishers to release the book in the United States.  It was a super satisfying conclusion and even though the book runs a bit longer than the others, it goes by so quickly I finished it in a weekend. A must-read for any fans of the previous two novels and if you haven't read them yet - I don't know what you're waiting for :) Get it out of the library and give it a try if you don't want to make the commitment of buying it. But seriously, it's so good you'll want it to go back and read again.

0307269981|3.0|If you liked \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\\" you need to read this in order to get to the third and final book. Like you'd figure, as a middle book in a trilogy, this isn't a good stand-alone novel; the ending leaves the main plot points unresolved for the most part.<br /><br />If you plan to read all three books, dive in. The at times clunky plotting and almost over-the-top story elements in \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" are present in \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" but the incredibly strong characters of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist draw you in and will keep you reading. It's difficult not to like Larsson's authorial voice.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|A 12 yr old named Dre (Jaden Smith) moves to China with his mother (Taraji P. Henson) and is bullied right away by a kid named Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). Dre has a crush on a girl named Meiying and Cheng is jealous that Meiying seems to like Dre as well. Dre hates it in China and wants to leave, but a maintenance man named Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) gives him a reason to stay when he agrees to train him for a Kung-Fu tournament against his bullies.<br /><br />  The Karate Kid was the most unnecessary remake and the one I dreaded to see the most, \\"well that is until the idiots in Hollywood decide to remake Back to the Future\\", but the movie is surprisingly good. There's beautiful locations, fine acting and the film is moving despite an overly familiar story.<br /><br />  One of my problems with the movie is how good Dre is in the tournament. I mean, there's no scenes where Mr. Han taught him how to do flipping back kicks and all the other cheesy fancy moves that he does. While a little 12 yr old being beaten up as bad as Dre does in some scenes is hard to sit through. Despite that, I felt that most of the movie was beautifully done.
B003HE2B6C|4.0|If you haven't heard Hanson since their 90s heartthrob days, it's worth giving them a fresh listen. They just might surprise you with their musical integrity and pop/rock sensibility. They've managed to do something dozens of child stars and one-hit-wonders failed to do: keep on doing what they're good at, despite the naysayers.     After the emotional and mature effort of 2007's THE WALK, I was looking forward to this album. I liked the direction their music had taken--strong messages, solid hooks, and a very raw live-from-the-floor feel. SHOUT IT OUT delights in a different way. It is fun, funky, and takes the band back to its 50s and 60s roots.    THINKING 'BOUT SOMETHING is the single for the non-fans. Catchy cowbell and dazzling horns certainly make it one of the dance tunes of the summer, and will probably win them a few new listeners.    Songs like CARRY YOU THERE and MY, MYSELF AND I have a more distinctly \\"hanson\\" feel to them. A sound that is a little more grounded and heartfelt.     I give this album a 4 for catchy tunes and solid musicianship. The missing star is for lyrics, which have been stronger in the past (as in BLUE SKY: this hope for answered questions / I swear is true conviction / I stare into the distance / there is no truth in sight) and the lack of lead vocals from oldest brother Issac, who has arguably the smoothest and most technically sound vocals of the band.     Pick up this album for good summer listening, and you won't be disappointed. For something more substantive, see their 2007 release THE WALK.
B003NHRIUW|5.0|Not only was the novel amazing, the movie was too.  Every one who judges the movie simply becuase of Miley's past career are wrongly doing so.  Try the movie out and you won't be dissapointed.  Obviously not everything is for everyone, but for all those looking to enjoy a sappy love movie, this is for you!  It's great for the family and a very down to earth drama. Get over her Hannah alter-ego and move on as she is trying to.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I feel kinda stupid that I waited so long to get into Talking Heads. I have heard there music and pretty much liked and sometimes loved cuts, but I thought they were a gimicky studio band for some reason. I am 57 years old and I am into BLUES ROCK REGGAE SOUL FUNK JAZZ R&B ETC. THIS DVD is not just great music it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The production vaules are impecable the originally is second to none. If you are a music fan you will fall in love with this DVD. This dvd deserves it's own catagory. 5 stars does not do it justice.     I first bought Rhino's greatest hits talking Heads and was instantly blown away, and then I ordered this and LIVE IN ROME dvd and the newer Rhino collection. Both dvd's get DOWNRIGHT FUNKY and TINA WEYMOUTH is the best female bass player that I know of. In closing I would like to say I want this DVD to be in my coffin actually URN I guess they can process both of us at the same time.thank You AMAZON FAMILY for all your help in my life.[[ASIN:B000021Y7X Stop Making Sense]]
0385504225|2.0|I read The Da Vinci Code a few years ago and thought it was an enjoyable read. However, I don't think The Lost Symbol is anywhere near as good. The story revolves around the main protaganist, Professor Robert Langdon, searching for clues in underground Washington, in an attempt to stop a deranged man from acquiring ancient Masonic secrets.<br /><br />I felt that the exciting moments in the plot were few and far between, and that the character development was poor. I found myself just drifting through paragraph after paragraph, on quite a few occasions while reading the book. Not one of this author's better novels.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|In his film _Tough Guise:  Violence, Media, and the Crisis in Masculinity_, Jackson Katz, anti-violence educator and activist, says at one point that when you \\"kill the messenger, you don't need to face squarely the implications of the message.\\"  I open with this quote since it reminds me so much of the reaction to Michael Moore's films:  so often reviews of his films open with an ad hominem attack on Moore himself.  (I've frequently seen this happen first-hand; I've taught _Bowling for Columbine_ in my college classes so that we can talk about issues of school violence, and my students want to attack Moore before they have even watched the film.) He is one of those filmmakers who polarizes his viewers, and his detractors want to shoot him down, without giving his ideas a fair listen.<br /><br />If you're open to Moore's messages, his newest film is worth a listen.  This documentary is about our capitalist society, but it's also an expose about the criminal activity that our corporations have engaged in, and towards which our government has turned a blind eye.  Most compelling, though, are the accounts and interviews of the average families who have been so affected by the last few years of recession.  Seeing these families lose their homes is hard to watch, and the connections that Moore makes between the Wall Street fat cats and the very real consequences that their actions have had on the average American family is distressing.<br /><br />If you're open to the message, this film is worth seeing.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I first rented this from our local public library not knowing what to expect, and I liked it so much I went on Amazon.com to purchase it!  I think everyone ought to see this remarkably well-made series on the life and times of our third President of the United States of America, John Adams.  I was impressed by the quality of acting, and attention to detail of early colonial America that was portrayed in this film.  Every history teacher in the U.S. ought to own a copy to show to students in their history classrooms, it is simply that great!

Can't believe its a made-for-TV, not cable, series. Has all the qualities of a cable show, without the sex, which is nice, so I can watch it with my younger relatives (13-16 crowd). Update on bluray version...I have been having alot of problems with the qaulity of the blu ray.  It seems to lose cloor, some shots appear to not be in HD...has anyone else had this problem?

I mean,Gee,I had high hopes for this new DeVo album and I wonder where the heck is Boojie Boy and what would he think?    This new album ranks up there with the old album \\"Shout\\" and the highlight of that album was the song \\"puppet boy\\" and thats not saying much is it.     There really isn't a song that stands out,and standing out from the crowd is what made DeVo special,but there is no Mongoloid,Blockhead,gates of steel or auto mowdown.     This is nothing but Mediocrity.    I am glad that DeVo is back and making music,since they are the men that make the music,I just wish that they would go back to making music that they love and not music they think or are told the masses would love.    Off this album I like the song \\"don't shoot (i'm a man)\\" It starts off like iron man and turns into working in the coal mine then at the end turns into,\\"don't tase me bro!\\"    ... ... ... \\"don't tase me bro\\" thats enough for me to turn this cd off...DeVo just make the music...okay.

006112429X|1.0|This book is one more contrived attempt to sensationalize the concept of the psychopath in our midst. It is a horror movie which becomes more horrible by the page. Eva is not a real mother, Kevin is not a real child and his father and sister are even more cardboard like characters. I have spent twenty years working with violent offenders and I have never met anyone as evil as Kevin. This is more like a vampire fantasy than a story of a human family and it worries me that anyone would think that this nightmare has anything to do with the difficulties and challenges of parenthood. It is quite clear that the reader is intended to shiver at the thought that Kevin has been hurting other children all along, torturing his sister and plotting against his parents. Kevin is the ultimate fantasy psychopath as his baby sister is his major victim. The fact that he becomes apparently remorseful and affectionate at the end of the book is completely unbelievable and makes nonsense of the previous 460 pages. I think it is a nasty piece of work.

0385341008|5.0|I loved this book.  Reading all of the letters that went back and forth between the characters reminded me of when I was a teenager.  I was a pen pal to several friends.  I really enjoyed writing to them and receiving their letters. I'm sorry now that I didn't keep any. It was fun picking out the pretty writing paper and anxiously waiting for the return mail.  Things were much more laid back, those many moons ago. :)<br /> Probably not as interesting as this book, but the letters kept us in touch with each other and our lives at the time.

0545123275|3.0|Quick & Dirty: This is a well-written, heartbreaking, and imaginative novel.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: I remember lying in the snow, a small red spot of warm going cold, surrounded by wolves.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />When Grace was a little girl, she was attacked by a pack of wolves.  Sam, a yellow eyed wolf came to her rescue.  Sam wasn't always a wolf.  He was also attacked.  Although Grace was bitten, she never changed.  Grace has an undeniable connection with her yellow eyed wolf.  In the subsequent years since her attack, she grows more obsessed and attached to her wolf, Sam.  Grace comes home one night to find a boy naked and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound.  Grace will do anything to keep Sam human because she needs him. A future without him is simply devastating.  Sam battles to stay warm so that he can remain human.  Once the winter arrives, he will turn into his wolf form.<br /><br />For the most part, the world-building is good, and the characterization is solid.  Grace and Sam have good chemistry, and I found it easy to get swept up in their emotions.  They were a bit cheesy and overly consumed with one another, but given their situation it's understandable.  Being a wolf isn't exactly easy.  It's a complex world of rules, secrets, and lies.  Sam wants to hold onto his humanity and build a relationship with Grace.  Grace is devoted to Sam and can't imagine her life without him.  In many ways they only have each other and for them this translates into a doomed love.  I have some misgivings about the depth of their relationship being so automatic and believable, but ultimately I liked these flawed characters.<br /><br />I do have a few issues with the book.  First, I think the pacing was a bit slow at times.  Second, certain aspects of the werewolf mythology don't stand up to scrutiny.  While I was initially taken with the rules that Ms. Stiefvater detailed, I ultimately had a hard time maintaining my suspension of disbelief.  The main tenant of the werewolf mythology is that the wolf changing patterns are governed by the temperature/seasons, as opposed to the phases of the moon.  Naturally, this raises some questions.  Why doesn't the pack just move to a location with a warmer climate?  Ms. Stiefvater offers an explanation, but it rings false as evidenced by other events that transpire.  I also think the \\"cure\\" for lack of a better word is lame.  There are other aspects of the werewolf mythology that I like.  Telling too much will spoil the experience of discovering this world, so I won't go into too much detail.<br /><br />Third, I absolutely despise Grace's parents.  I know that neglectful, abusive, and/or dead parents is a common trope in YA novels, but for some reason it really bothered me in this book.  The reason that Grace doesn't have enough structure and rules in her life is because her parents are completely self absorbed, and woefully absent from her life.  Grace is desperate for their affection and attention.  Her parents never seem to display any genuine concern for her or the things that are going on in her life.  I think it's appalling that Grace is able to have a boy essentially living with her in her parents' house, sleeping in her bed with her night after night, and her parents are completely oblivious to this.  Grace would go days without seeing or having any interaction with her parents.  I guess I found these parents to be too unrealistic.  What parents don't go into their child's bedroom? Ever?<br /><br />Overall, Ms. Stiefvater has penned a good novel.  The prose is beautiful and I loved how the alternating POVs were detailed.  Shiver is a beautifully constructed story, written in such vivid detail.  The plot has interesting twists that will illicit just about every emotion from the reader.  This book is sure to entertain readers.<br /><br />Notable Scene:<br /><br />A riot of sensations assaulted me as soon as I got into the living room.  Viciously cold air stung my eyes and twisted my stomach.  My eyes quickly found the ragged hole in the door to the back deck; partially cracked glass hung precariously in the frame and thin, pink-stained shards lay all over the floor, winking light back up at me.<br /><br />The chair at the breakfast table nook was knocked over.  It looked like someone had splattered red paint on the floor, endless erratic shapes dropped and smeared from the door to the kitchen.  For a moment I stood there, frozen by the absence of Grace and the frigid air and the stench of blood and wet fur.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Big Honcho Media provided me with a copy of Shiver.

B003CIG7AE|3.0|Sometimes, an album has snice songs, but relies too much upon formulas, and slick, predictable production values, to make the whole album a success.  Dozens of albums spring to mind that made this mistake. The very fact that BAND OF HORSES 3rd album sounds like SO MANY OTHER bands, is the heart of the problem.  The prefab formula used on this album keeps  any one particular song from standing out.  Every song is a mid tempo ballad, except for a couple of minor exceptions. DILLY and NW APT are semi-upbeat;  EVENING KITCHEN is acoustic, and a tad slower than the tempo of the rest of the album.  The vocals are harmonized via stacking, rather than interlocking vocal parts, thruout almost the album, resulting in more of this vibe of sameness, that could album be a theme itself.  The textures are as simular as the midwest farmlands. (There are no sonic mountains or valleys, just repetition, and sameness.) I'm sure that's cool if you want some backround music, that everybody will like cos it sounds consistantly \\"pretty\\".  A little more variety in this collection, would not have ruined the album's \\"unity\\", but rather have helped it.  So even tho I was lulled into a complacent enjoyment by INFINITE ARMS superficial sonic \\"prettiness\\", its a hard album to dive into, cos its just lacks depth.  The lyrics mostly repeat the theme of \\"lost love\\".  The vocal harmonies mostly omit counterpoint vocals, or back up vocal parts. Instead, the lead vocals stack the melody and harmony in a manner that provides thickness, but without any tension.  The musical textures have a SAMENESS to them, that gets on your nerves after awhile. Strings or keyboard washes support the acoustic guitar, bass and drum parts, with the occasional short lead on a slide guitar (with effects), or pedal steel.  This sound is found all over in MOR contemporary country-rock crossover bands, and has been for ages now.  WHen you work with a sound that's this over used, it can be challenging to find creativity, or individuality.  And at least the album is creative, you cant deny that. The professionalism of the band's set of songs, with solid lyrics,  keeps these songs from being a total waste.<br /><br />Now, who will enjoy this album really depends upon what you come here expecting to find. If you want variety of composistional approach, or a creative mash up of styles, or a variety of song tempos and times, or even unusual lyrical themes, then you might not enjoy INFINITE ARMS.  For that matter, if you want something urbane, with electronics, electric guitars, odd time signatures, surreal lyrical content, psychedelic textures or exotic instruments, you shouldnt even be considering this album.  If you want \\"pretty\\", in the sense of solid, thick production quality, stacked vocal harmonies, basic rock instrumentation, with a country-rural vibe applied to various love songs, then you'll enjoy this album.  The album packaging is unique, and \\"pretty\\", by the way.  Inside the triptich fold out album cover, is a packet of single photos, each taken of various natural rural settings, like old wooden one room churches, cowboys lassoing their steers, national park type waterfalls, etc, that scream TRITE AMERICANA. (The giant roadside girafe statue, is the only photo that takes a good laugh at the triviality of these photos.) On the back of the photos, are bits of lyrics, little drawings, and the album credits. Like the music the album contains, they are PRETTY, but all contain a certain SAMENESS.  So even the album art kept to a basic approach that BAND OF HORSES stuck to like glue.  An album like this drifts into the backround, and rarely breaks thru.  It's almost ambient country pop.  It will definatly appeal to anyone who enjoys the qualities of PRETTINESS, and SAMENESS, and FLATNESS.  I'm not putting those qualities down, actually.  Lots of people live their whole lives in flat farmland, never seeing mountains, valleys, oceans, or discovering other countries and cultures. The people who live within this rural flatland enjoy their lives, and why shouldnt they? It's only monotonous if you cant see beauty within the sameness of this landscape, or the daily rituals of rural life.  That applies to this album as well.  Its filled with sameness, but that's not without its own type of beauty.  I occasionally like rural americana, midwestern farmland culture, and the culture it exudes. It IS pretty. This is a pretty album. There's nothing hard, jarring or confrontational here.  If you need more than PRETTY for you to enjoy BEAUTY, and find musical variety more beautiful than sonic SAMENESS, you might discover this album a bit on the boring side.  Sure, its relaxing, but for many people, it may lack a certain creativity, and variety.  So, unless you want some soft country poprock for the backround of your life, i'd skip this album. (Maybe check out BOH's early work, and go from there.)e within this rural flatland enjoy their lives, and why shouldnt they?

0525421580|5.0|Everyone knows there are others who share their names. It's not something you think about that much. But because of the basic law of averages, these people do exist.    No matter its title Will Grayson, Will Grayson is not about those people. Instead it uses these name doppelgangers (in this case Will Graysons) as a sort of leaping board for the plot, giving Will Grayson, Will Grayson the room it needs to become the truly fantastic young adult book that could only be possible from the creative minds of John Green and David Levithan.    Will Grayson, Will Grayson is instead about relationships. It is not some corny young adult book where everyone gets with their soul mates and they all live happily ever after. And it is not a sad depressing lifetime movie type of book where everyone discovers their love only to die tragically before they can profess it. Instead this book is about all the different forms of relationships; from straight, to gay, to friendships, and how everything may not work out perfectly but it's about having the person you love along with you for the ride, no matter who they might be.    Now the characters were all incredible, but the one character they truly stood out in my mind was Tiny Cooper. Tiny, like in his play, is truly the star of this book. And whether you like one Will Grayson, or one relationship, no matter what you will love Tiny.    In fact it is because of Tiny alone that readers should read this book. He and thus the book, are funny, endearing, exciting, and all around fabulous. And while there are some controversial topics in Will Grayson, Will Grayson, it is a book that everyone who enjoys young adult fiction, or even just good books should try.    [...]
0439023483|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book. I am going to be teaching High School students soon and I wanted to see what they are reading so I picked this book up. I couldn't put it down. This book is perfect for all ages and sexes. It has so many different themes playing out that it is perfect for teachers and students alike. As I mentioned before, being appropriate for both sexes at that age is a difficult undertaking for any author. Suzanne Collins does this in an unbelievable way. She is able to grab the boys with having a boy and girl main character and the acts of violence that they must do to survive, while she can still hold on to the girls with the main character and a bit of a love story. I recommended this book for anyone and I am currently reading the second one in the series and are not disappointed on it yet!
B0000025BA|5.0|TAPESTRY may not be the first songer-songwriter album, but it is almost certainly the one defined the genre, bringing into clear focus the type of personal autobiographical, and socially relevant songs that like-minded artists would taskle for the next 30 years and beyond.  Along with james Taylor, Carole King would become the face of this fledgling phenomenon and Tapestry is the greatest monument to its potential for beauty and relevance.<br /><br />First, last and always, the greatness of TAPESTRY lies in the incredible quality of the songs.  Every one is a classic, from the upbeat opener, \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\"  to the closer \\"You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman.\\"  Aretha Franklin will forever posesss the definitive version of the latter song, but in the hands of King, the songwriter, it is transformed.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the greatest collections of songs ever assembled on one album in the singer-songwriter genre.
B003INJETO|5.0|Having listened to this album several times now and having taken into account many of the very valid points that my fellow reviewers have made, it's very safe to come to the conclusion that Pain of Salvation are definitely a band that will challenge it's listeners and fans both new and old. They will always produce music which will need to be revisisted and listened to more than once or twice, it's kind of like an onion, full of layers....where have you heard that before? I await each and every one of their releases with anticipation as I just never know what I'm about to hear. Such is the case with \\"Rock Salt One\\". Even the cover is reminiscent of those famous 70's releases of bands such as Free, Bad Company and Led Zeppelin with members faces cut into mountain sides and drawn in very old fashined styles. Upon reflection, the cd sleeve nicely captures the feel of the music with Pain Of Salvation tipping it's hat to many of their influences over time. These guys are amazing musicians and Daniel Glidenlow is a very talented vocalist and they manage to adapt so easily to any genre of music. What makes \\"Rock Salt One\\" harder to digest is that there really are so many different directions going on here, they do sound like a different band with each track. But how many bands do you know that are able to achieve the same thing and sounds so solidly convincing? I guess the premise of progressive music is that it gives artists licence to break the conventions, to challenge the rules and to stray away from the norm. Pain of Salvation are just simply on top of the list of bands that can do this and get away with it, and  perhaps at the same time appeal to an untapped list of fans yet to discover the joys of what Pain Of Salvation can do....I give \\"Rock Salt One\\" 5 stars purely on musical ability and yet another chapter of Pain of Savation's endless repertoir. I can't wait to see what's next.
B003A4IFGY|4.0|at first i was disappinted at the album as there are really no catchy songs that stick in your head at first listen.  however i found i kept putting it back in the cd player and after 4-5 listens i realized i actually like this album from TP.  the blues numbers really fit his voice style and the laid back sound of many tracks makes this a nice album for the end of the day.  nice work
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Small on special effects, Big on storyline. Having read the books as a child i was always a big fan. This version is outstanding!- Thought provoking, humanistic. even Trolls may not be monsters, maybe men are? Worth a watch, for people who want to use their brain while watching a movie and a movie that is not just mindless entertainment as well..
B00004TH6O|5.0|Much as I like Songs For The Deaf, this one, Rated R, is my favorite of the QOTSA compilations.  I am never tired listening to it. I should be. I've heard it plenty of times.  A good album needs a certain amount of variety:  every song on Rated R has a unique voiceprint.  A good album requires the band play in fusion: they're tight on this one.  A good album keeps the listener intrigued: Rated R, in spades.   A good album works on more than one level: Rated R, yes, although I still haven't figured what some of the lyrics are really about. . . .  A good album lasts: this one's got some years on it, but the tread is barely worn.  Their music won't get old. They're too creative.    Love this album. Hate that the band, QOTSA, is no longer together, but the musicians are still out there making music.  This is one of those albums that you either really love--passionately, or it's not for you.   It's definitely for me. Thank you, lads, for the lovely sounds.
0345479092|5.0|I have been having trouble getting my 11 week old daughter to sleep since about her third week in this world.  She seemed to have colic, but is just starting to come out of that phase.  I have not finished reading the book and already want to shout its praises and buy a copy for every new mom.  In one day, I was able to get my daughter to sleep for two naps and her night time sleep session without nursing her, rocking her or walking her, just by reading the cues put forth in the book.  Please buy this book and read it before you give birth.  It will save you some tears...I guarantee it.  I no longer think my infant had colic, I believe she was overtired and overstimulated.

B0007N1AI6|5.0|I can still remember my excitement the day that I purchased this CD and brought it home to listen to. I could hardly wait to hear what the newly reunited Judas Priest had in store for me on their new album, and I can honestly say that I was not disappointed in the least with what I heard. Angel of Retribution turned out to be one of my favorite Judas Priest albums ever, almost rivaling even the mighty, and my personal favorite, Defenders of the Faith (Still their best album ever, in my opinion.) Yes the King of all singers, Rob Halford had returned to his musical throne and the mighty Metal Gods Judas Priest were back!<br /><br />From beginning to end, Angel of Retribution is an awesome collection of songs that will go down in history as being one of the biggest and best musical comebacks of all time. Songs like Judas Rising, Demonizer, Wheels of Fire, Hellrider, Angel, and even the long and lumbering Lochness are all amazing tracks that fit right in with the best of the Priest catalog.<br /><br />I followed Halford's career throughout the years after his departure with Priest in all of it's incarnations (Fight, Halford, and even Two), and I found something enjoyable in all of it, but nothing he did solo sounded as sweet to my ears as his reunion with Priest. It really is a great album and I highly recommend it to all Heavy Metal fans around the world.<br /><br />Standout Tracks are: ALL OF THEM!

B003JYOFIW|5.0|DEVO do what they do best and I do thank you DEVO! Yes! This album is like a refreshing blast from the New Wave past and then some. It's hard to believe that it's been twenty years since DEVO last did an album together?! To tell you the truth, over the years I had given up hope and never thought they'd ever do another album again. But when I first heard that familiar DEVO sound on a famous Dell computer commercial a couple of years ago, well, I had an inkling of hope that maybe, just maybe something was coming down the pipe soon from my favorite New Wave band from the Eighties. And Lo and behold it has arrived.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, DEVO is not a one hit wonder. No Sirs and Madams. These guys came up with many hits over the years, and from what I am hearing on this new disk, they have done it once again. I am hearing hit after hit on this album with such great ditties as Sumthin', Fresh, Mind Games, Don't Shoot I'm a Man, Please Baby Please, What We Do...Heck, the whole album is a hit as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />So sit back, crank it up, put on your energy domes, and spazz out with these old school New Wave masters as they show you how it's really done the DEVO way.<br /><br />Standout Tracks are: ALL OF THEM!
B001HN69AY|4.0|The movie is simply fantastic, and if you are a Terry Gilliam fan you can't miss this one.    I experienced a delay (about 1 week) in the delivery, and that put me in a bit stress since I don't live in the US and I had other packages also already delivered on time by Amazon to be sent overseas. The rest of the service was average since Amazon was in touch with me once I emailed my concern.
B00009P1OD|5.0|If you really like this album you NEED to RUN and BUY THE DVD!  Buried in these Amazon reviews is one that mentions how much better the DVD mix is compared to CD.  First of all, THANK YOU to that person!  Seriously.  The DVD is phenomenal.  And (sadly) it's discontinued.  So if you really like this album STOP READING THIS REVIEW and BUY THE DVD wherever you can find it.      I learned how to play drums off this album (vinyl to cassette), and I've gone through it literally thousands of times over the years.  I've had it on CD for decades.  The DVD provides clarity and detail beyond belief.  They are not cheap, but they are worth every cent.  And for the record, I'm not selling my copy.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|This second season kept me up until sunrise.  This is the best show around these days and while I was wondering where they could go after Season 1, the whole of Season 2 just rocked my socks off.  \\"Ellen is kinda hot\\", in the words of Patty's son.  In Season 2, we get to watch her transform from innocent into borderline \\"femme fatale\\", and there's something that borders on the architypical or legendary in her expression of the persona - beautiful, melancholy, deadly.    I was surprised they could follow up so strong after such a very good first season.  Patty has become more sympathetic and you find you are actually rooting for her much of the time.  She still packs her usual punch though, and when least expected.  Conversely, she takes a few herself.    Rose Byrne and Glenn Close were just fantastic and all the villains were great.  So many different characters.  I love the set locations on this show.  They have a very authentic feeling and they are used without ostentation to great effect.  Interestingly and beautifully shot, seamless fast paced action, tight dialogue and plot are what you get with Damages Season 2.  Just excellent.
B0006U4UAU|2.0|Ok, I'll give it 2 stars for being well-produced and catchy, BUT it's a direct ripoff from New Order, Bronski Beat, Pet Shop Boys, Erasure, and later followers Daft Punk, Moby, etc. Even Talvin Singh and Kid Loco had that niche well (re)covered since the late 90's.   Liberating swifty licks/beats from other artists is nothing new, I just don't understand the flood of kids that think this groundbreaking.

0385341008|5.0|I enjoyed this delightful book so much that I purposefully slowed down my reading as I neared the end of it. Would Dawsey and Juliet get together? Would Juliet become bored with Guernsey life and move to London? Would Kit's fate be a happy one? I was truly captivated by the assortment of people on Guernsey, their personalities and everyday goings-on. Plus, I enjoyed the historical aspect of the novel, for I was truly ignorant of the German influx of soldiers, the scarcity of food, and the deportation of children to London.<br /><br />A particularly enjoyable aspect of the novel is the author's use of letters between different people to tell the story (stories) of life not only in Guernsey but also in London and other places. Each writer had a different voice and a different tale to tell. There were at least 15 or 20 of them (writers), and their composite story was magnificent.<br /><br />The letters were awesome. Some were short (a phrase or two) while some were quite lengthy. Many were humorous while others dealt with serious matters of love, life, and death. Many were sprinkled with lines from books that various society members had read. One that I particularly like was Clovis's description of how he won his wife's heart. Apparently, she wouldn't give him the time of day until he read that women love literary words and then proceeded to recite some of Wordsworth's words to her. \\"Lookie there, Nancy,\\" Clovis said. \\"The gentleness of Heaven broods o'er the sea--listen, the mighty Being is awake,\\" she let him kiss her and then agreed to be his wife.<br /><br />I agree with dear Isola's statement that \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books.\\" I'm ruined!

0316044938|2.0|The book was interesting in the beginning but then it kept switching back and forth from watching the criminal get away with the crime to the victim of the killer watching her family crumble down each day without a clue of who did this to her. This made me kind of bored because I would really get into the part of how the criminal was covering his tracks and getting away with it. And also how the police got close but lose the evidence. It made me start to lose interest and gradually I stopped reading book. I would recommend this book to whoever has the patience to rewrite and congrats those who made it through this book.  Also if I had rewritten this book I would turn Susie's p.o.v. into a different book sort of like another side of the story but in a different book.

0385732554|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars because of all the parts that I thought were the best parts in this book. I really recommend this book for people because of there was the best climax at the right moment in this book. I disliked that in this book everyone got there real jobs at only 12 years old. I also disliked the fact that people get \\"released\\" because I think they should have the elder people go threw old age without having to die early. At the end of the book Jonas and his little sister had escaped from the community and I thought that would be a good part in the book because they found out what it means to be released and they didn't want to be part of the community anymore so they had escaped.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|It is truly sad to see a great director like Scorsese stop being creative, try to imitate, and fail so miserably. I guess it started when Departed garnered him an academy award. There is nothing original about that movie, and the Hong Kong version which it was based upon is superior. That is just the way things are in Hollywood. What is Scorsese trying to do here? Make another 6th Sense? At the end of 6th Sense, there was this revelation, \\"ah, everything all make sense now\\". At the end of this one, after following the plot the whole time and it just spent five minutes trying to convince you that this indeed was the truth, there is just no way it could work. You can still rent it, the cinematograhy is nice, and Scorsese assembled a very respectable cast, but don't expect a big payoff after all the suspense.
0439023483|5.0|Its the 74th annual hunger games meaning this is the 74th time tributes fight til the death. Every year as punishment to the rebellion of district 13, which no longer exist, the other 12 districts must elect a boy and girl from the ages of 12 - 18 through a reaping. The tributes are later trained and then sent into the arena as they battle with others. A cruicial \\"celebration\\", and everyone watches as their children fights for their survival.    However in the story the protagonist Katniss, from district 12, volunteered in the games in order to save her precious sister Primrose. Peeta, the boy canidate is a boy who helped Katniss in her time of need years ago. The games begins and the rule for the 74 years of the game is only one winner.     Katniss enters the arena and it becomes the most memorable year. The Hunger Games gets more intriguing  with twisted events that no one in Panem has ever expected, especially when it is directed towards the Capitol and system.     Although will she survive? What are the consequences to her action?     It is a book I borrowed from my teacher for an assignment and I couldn't put it down, even at my work. Even after reading it and unfortunately returning it, I was determined to get my own copy of the book, so I went out to buy it. An easy read so you can visualize the story like a movie. The writing was amazing, great descriptions and details, it really helped the imagery.   It leads you guessing, but everytime it'll surprise you with something unexpected, a great storyline.    Overall definitely a must read book, especially for sci-fi lovers! ¢¾ It is recommended for teens and older since it does contain some gruesome parts.
B001FB5634|5.0|It is not a masterpiece in the same sense as Toy Story by Pixar is a masterpiece. It is not a family movie, and you don't walk away with a warm feeling, but you will probably want to give your family a good hug afterwards. At some parts, it is a difficult movie to watch, but it gets the point across. Only after everything is taken away, your internet, electricity, food and water, then will you hold on to what is truly important. The director did a fantastic job in conveying the sense of desolation and hopelessness in their struggles. I especially liked the flashbacks to a time before and after armageddon. Watch it if you dare. Be warned, this one will stay with you. But that is how I like movies. Didn't know Robert Duvall was in this one, see if you can recognize him.
B001BMXFX0|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold is a tragedy about how Susie Salmon and how she is brutally murdered by George Harvey a resident in her neighborhood.At the same time it is a beautiful story because susie doesnt want to go to heaven just yet so she can still see her family live their lives.Susie watches over her little sister in a way,she watches her talk to the boy she likes and get her first kiss.There is suspision goin around about who killed Susie Salmon?    The thing that really drew me on to this book is how the main character is a dead girl watchin her family live their lives i thought it was really unique.It's the type of book that you wouldnt be able to put down.One thing about the book i disliked is that for a portion of the story they get off the subject of the murder.The murder is what really drew me on to the story and when she stopped writing about it i lost some interest.besides that this was a great book nd i would defenitly recommend it to any reader.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Sure, the Cold War may be over more or less, or perhaps the rival countries have changed, but this film is still frightening in its implications of doomsday scenarious, potential behaviors by people on both sides of the conflict, and different views of a world after a nuclear war.<br /><br />Look for a very young Larry Hagman as the president's translator of Russian.  Nice job from the actor in his early days.<br />Walter Matthau is far from comedic as the coldly philosophizing man who thinks killing 40 million to save the rest is a bargain of sorts.<br />Henry Fonda also does a great job as the U.S. President.<br />I also appreciated that fact that they were not willing to portray the Russians as evil and soulless machines bent on destruction; they were humanized instead.<br /><br />Great film!
B00008J2PG|4.0|This is a surprisingly good Italian TV film,  shot in Rome, with very good technical aspects,  and fine performances by Gielgud, Plummer and Peck.  Story is based on real life Irish Priest's (Peck)   resistance to German occupation of Italy.  Gielgud  plays Pope Pius, and Plummer is the commanding  Nazi officer. Well worth a viewing.
B000F8O2OM|4.0|I loved the film and half of the episodes from season one. The other half from the first season were too obsessed with drama and poor plots. But the pilot was good and so were the other half of the episodes from the season. In season two, however, almost all the episodes were good. Once again we have good plots and a lot of action. Highly recommended!

B003JYOFIW|5.0|Ever get an album from a group that hasn't put out anything new in years only to be shocked by their new sound? Well there ain't no shock here. This is the Devo sound we know. No only do we know the sound, but we have heard bits and pieces of it before. When you listen to Fresh, you will hear the lead guitar in Be Stiff. When hear Something For Everybody, you hear the drums in Whip It. That ain't bad at all. It is Devo comfort food. I am thoroughly enjoying it.     But what is with the new outfit and the Candy-O album cover?

0385733577|5.0|I purchased the audio version of this book to listen to with my 10 year old son during a recent road trip.  We both absolutely loved it.  My son recently finished Rick Riordan's wonderful Percy Jackson series and he was actually  worried that he would never again feel the same level of excitement about any series of books. :-)  Ahh youth.  I set out to find something new for him and really hit a home run with this book.  We finished the book during the trip and he had me buy the rest of the series (thus far 4 books) as soon as we returned home.  The wait for delivery was hard for him, but totally worth it to get them all in the beautiful hardcover versions.  He has ripped right into the second book and is teasing me because I have to wait for him to finish before I can find out what happens next.  I highly recommend this series.
0385737947|3.0|This book is about a group of teenage boys who live in a walled area they refer to as the Glade, surround by miles of dangerous maze. No one has any concrete memories, they may know what a movie theater is but can't picture it. They cannot remember people from their past at all. Runners search the maze each day, which changes every night, searching for a way out. Things are thrown out of whack when Thomas arrives and the next day a girl arrives with an ominous  message. The teens eventually realize they MUST get out or die.<br /><br />*It had a good storyline, though I felt it was underdeveloped.<br />*Time seemed very disjointed and moved too fast to make sense in some parts (ex. first night spent in the maze).<br />*Some parts were too predictable.<br />*Character development felt rushed, I wasn't able to fully connect with them.<br /><br />Honestly, it was a decent book. And I will probably read the rest of the series. However, it is not one of my favorites, nor close to that list. It was just ok.
0385341008|4.0|The only context where I heard of Guernsey before knowing of \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" were Guernsey sweaters. Then I started seeing this book everywhere and people talked about it. It got me curious and finally I bought it at the airport. I was happy I did...<br /><br />At first, I was surprised at the form of the novel - completely epistolographic. It is rare, I think, among contemporary popular novels, which tend to be adjusted to the reader's reality even when they describe the past. In the era of Internet, we seldom write letters any more, and seldom wait for any, although the wait was precisely what made the letters so precious. Letters, in contrast to e-mails, text messages, tweets et cetera, tended to be much more thought over and revealed a lot about the writer. In this book, the plethora of letters, written by many people, show their personalities, feelings, insecurities, complexes, hopes... The prose varies, making \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" a formal gem.<br /><br />The plot is simple: Great Britain recovers from World War II. Juliet Ashton, a journalist and aspiring writer, has published a collection of her feuilletons published in \\"The Spectator\\" under the pen name Izzy Bickerstaff. Suddenly, she finds fame, whch she could not taste as an author of solid, but not exciting biography of Anne Br&ouml;nte. She begins to meet with the readers and receive fan mail. One day, she receives the letter from Guernsey. The letter is not about her latest achievement. Instead, it is from a farmer, who had a copy of Charles Lamb's novel that once belonged to Juliet. The letter, which mentions a local literary society, is intriguing enough for Juliet to start a correspondence with the author, expand it to the other society members (and more) and eventually embark on a life-changing trip to Guernsey. On the island, Juliet learns of the lives of its inhabitants during the war, and hears about Elizabeth, the one Society member she would not have an opportunity to meet. She also finds friendship and love.<br /><br />This heart-warming novel did for Guernsey what Frances Mayes did for Tuscany and Peter Mayle for Provence. Already now, there are much more tourists heading for this small Channel island. The history of Guernsey is sketched well for a lay reader, and together with the well depicted, although schematic, characters, dramatic events, deep humanity and a lot of humor, the book provides a nice change from everyday life.

B000BCE918|2.0|This is not a review of the movies.  They are great, duh.    This is a review of the case.  Not so great.    The movies are constantly falling out equalling tons of scratches.  They don't pop in, they just sit there loosly.  I hope this is just mine, but beware.
B000E6Y7LI|4.0|Even thought Tony Jaa just did a cameo in this movie all in all it turned out to be pretty funny. This is not a serious Kung-Fu movie, but it was entertaining, you even get to see some of Thailand to boot so it worked for  me.
B001C09KD0|5.0|it was a pleasure to read! only took me 4 or 5 days I think....but Italy reads in one breath, Indonesia in two and India in three :) Italy is the most fun and favorite part of mine!  Loved it very much....book reads easier and I think is better in the beginning, I should say than to the end...but overall enjoyed it very much with its humor, scenery, metaphors....she has her way with language ,that's for sure. Pleasure to read.
B0034G4OYU|5.0|Space.  To bodly go where no man has gone before...    For a recommended movie, this one tops the cake.  You just gotta see it.    As an adult, I wouldn't normally use the term OMG, but there's no better description for this show we saw at the IMAX theatre the other day.  And my husband... well all he could say was WOW!  I almost had to close his mouth shut at the end because he was so impressed, his jaw dropped.  We were both taken aback.      There's an excellant review called 'Hubble 3D: It's a Must See' I found at Review Gallery:  [...]
B00064WSNW|3.0|As a long time fan of progressive or art rock from the likes of Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and more recently, King Crimson, I am always eager to find \\"new\\" music. By new I generally mean music from the 1970s that has a sensibility similar to the bands I just mentioned. And although I only recently began listening to King Crimson, I liked them enough to buy their first seven albums.     As I read reviews on Amazon for the first three from the 1980s, I got excited. I didn't bother listening to the supplied snippets as reviewers promised that these albums were even better than anything King Crimson released in the 60s or 70s. Well, suffice it to say I don't necessarily agree with some of the other reviews.    While I wouldn't call any of the three albums I purchased (Discipline, Beat, and Three of a Perfect Pair) bad, they are closer to a funky cross between The Talking Heads and Frank Zappa than anything the band did before. The music is indeed good, but it doesn't appear to be progressive rock anymore. Instead of a mix of classical, rock, and jazz, it's more of a cross between funk, rock, and jazz.    So buyer beware! If you're ready for something more current than what King Crimson released in the 60s and 70s, these albums will deliver that. But if you wanted something a little closer to the great progressive rock of that era, look elsewhere.
B000FA57US|2.0|Halloween 5 takes place right after the closing scene of the fourth. After the state police has unloaded on Mikey he falls down a mine shaft which happens to be conveniently located near a river offering a quick escape. The police appear to throw pipe bombs down the shaft and then casually leave, not thinking to collect the body and take it to the mourge. With the prior experience of Michael surviving gas explosions, gunshot wounds, and falling from high places one would think that the police would actually make sure Mike was dead before calling it a day. But hey I guess they want him to come back. It is probably a pretty dull town for a cop and maybe they are looking for a little action. The movie is pretty ridiculous and basically recylces scenes from the previous. We get the typical 80s MTV generation of annoying teenagers who serve as fodder for Mike. Then his annoying niece who now has a psychic connection to Mike which Dr. Loomis, Hes still alive yes, tries to capitalize on. The ending was so typical of a horror movie that i was actually laughing in the theatre. I almost had hope that the cops in this film had become smarter but no they remain stupid and easily ployed. Let me give a brief synopsis of the closing act. They use Mikey's niece as bait to draw him into an ambush. there are tons of police, swat, and national guard troops waiting to waste mike. You think to yourself, ok this is gonna be good. Then a random radio call comes in and all the cops pack up and leave. I thought to myself \\"Really?\\". couldnt they have left at least a small contigent to stay in case mikey shows? Nope. they all leave and as a result mike shows up, chases his niece around the house a little, then dies from a few savage blows with a piece of lumber from an old man. Note to self...Savage serial killers cannot be killed by a barrage of bullets, but will keel over if struck with a piece of wood.
030726999X|4.0|I enjoyed the first two of the trilogy better than this last one.  I still couldn't put it down until I finished it  The one drawback is that pages fell out of this hardback book which tells me they may have had a production problem with binding the book.

B003JYOFIW|4.0|Having been a devo-ted DEVO fan for 32 years, I approached their new \\"comeback\\" CD after a two-decade gap with a mixture of both anticipation and dread - even if snippets from the their recent fan-approved, corporate focus group \\"Song Study\\" sounded promising. Ever since DEVO's ground-breaking debut, their subsequent releases had proved rock's typical law of diminishing returns: after putting out four amazing, visionary LPs in four short years during their early \\"golden\\" period (1978's Are We Not Men, 1979's Duty Now for Future, 1980's Freedom of Choice, & 1981's New Traditionalist, each one sounding more slick & mainstream than the last), DEVO truly started to de-volve (or go creatively bankrupt, depending on how you look at it) with 1982's Oh No, It's Devo - and sputtered with 1984's Shout, before seeming to reach a dead-end and go on auto-pilot, cranking out depressingly bland efforts like late-80s Total Devo and 1990's Smooth Noodle Maps, alas, their last full studio album. Now, 20 years later, DEVO are back with marketing guru Mother, a spiffy  new look/color scheme, and sly, ironic humor in tact, not to mention hooks galore. Upon first listen, I'm going out on a limb to declare that DEVO's new Something for Everybody is, dare I say it, their best effort since 1981's New Traditionalists, simultaneously sounding Fresh, yet comfortingly familiar all at once - no small feat. It's the kind of record you spin once and already sounds like a instant classic that burrows into your brain on contact. While the production has been beefed up and smoothed out w/ a state-of-the-art studio sheen circa 2010 by Greg Kurstin (Bird & the Bee, Kylie, etc.) and others, key remnants of the early-period Devo signature sound remain: quirky, stop-start rhythms, simple-yet-addictive synth lines, sonic blasts of guitar, quirky, offbeat lyrics, etc. - all delivered with more muscle, vigor, and pep than you'd expect from men in their 50s. Upon first listen, obvious standouts include FRESH(probably the most catchy, commercial single they've done since 1980's Whip It, in a good way), PLEASE BABY PLEASE, DON'T SHOOT I'M A MAN, CAMEO (an updated Peekaboo redux), and especially the propulsive, driving HUMAN ROCKET (think Going Under-cum-Spud Patrol/Mr DNA on steroids).  While the last third of the CD peters out a bit, both musically and lyrically, I wish they had beefed up the guitars throughout, and some of the tunes are a bit formulaic, this is still easily the strongest, most consistent longplayer that DEVO has delivered in almost 30 YEARS (!!) - and that's really sayin' something. There's no use denying it: We're all DE-VO - and this CD truly offers Something for Everybody. Every home should have one. Get yours today.

B000VX1CF8|5.0|I bought these shoes for one of my sons as a gift, but I ordered the wrong size. However, I have an identical pair myself and they have worn extremely well, without signs of age or deterioration. I've had them for about two years, and wear them frequently. They are comfortable and provide excellent support, and they look good while doing so. I recommend them.
B003PGNBO8|1.0|Once again, those of us who already own Part One, Season One of a TV show are forced to buy a whole season if we also want Part Two.  I'm supposed to pay $42 for a few episodes after part one?  I don't think so.  ABC canceled this show without a series resolution (unlike 'Lost') anyway, so unless you like to be left hanging you may consider not buying this either.
B001SN78JO|5.0|This movie totally slipped beneath the cracks huh? I forgot it even existed. But I saw it earlier today on HBO 9 or whatever channel it was, and really liked it alot.<br />It's not much of a thinking movie, basically what happens is that Jim Carrey is sort of a stuck up and boxed in type of guy, who winds up at this seminar where he discovers the power of always saying YES to everything.<br />The movie sort of flows along, without much conflict at all. It's almost as if, if you really went along and just said yes to everything, that life would be perfect. Yet,,, still full of laughs.<br /><br />Carreys boss in the movie, a character named Norm cracks me up everytime. And Zooey Deschnal (spelling?) as usual is the love of my life. Sure she was good in 500 Days of Summer, but I enjoyed her character a lot more in this one, and the way she mixed with the style and timing of Carrey works perfectly. Theres Hyde from the seventies show and the dude from The Hangover too as Carreys close friends.  There is some conflict between the romance at the end, but the positive and upbeat swing of the story never stops. Just say yes to this one. I thought it was great!
B003CIG7AE|3.0|My first experience with Band of Horses came some time around the release of \\"Z\\" by My Morning Jacket.  Maybe it was Pandora's doing.  However I got there, I was pleased.<br /><br />Infinite Arms is one of those musical albums that is well executed and pleasant to listen to, but immediately forgettable once it's over.  Based on previous releases, I was hoping for better hooks, and more variety in both song and lyrics in this album.  If anything, this album is too refined...too overproduced.  None of the raw and exciting qualities that turned me on to Band of Horses in the first place really came through for me.<br /><br />Music is subjective, of course.  I still recommend giving it a listen, but for me, it just wasn't anything special.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This is a great album overall. It has great pacing from start to finish and it very well produced. I think this album tops Mutter by a slim margin. The music is enjoyable even if you are not into metal. I would categorize this music as pop-metal, or maybe industrial dance. It is quite a good listen and you can try it out if you haven't! :)

030745455X|1.0|I didn't review the first book. I thought it was a decent page-turner that kept my attention all the way to its predictable pseudo-twist ending, if a little contrived and certainly overrated.<br /><br />What I read here was a formless, repetitive piece of trash-trash (this isn't even trash for the sake of guilty but knowing indulgence).<br /><br />It was like reading a first draft written by a first-year undergrad. I wondered as I was reading if there hadn't been some posthumous legal clause that kept it from being edited. Surely, there may have been a decent story buried in its lack of structure. The three simultaneous investigations get tiring very quickly, and although she's a mildly interesting character, I wanted more. I also wanted more from Mikael, whose compulsive womanizing could have led to some great observations about his character (or maybe some suitably kinky black-widow plot revelation) but instead stood as nothing more than Stieg Larsson's blatantly transparent ego.<br /><br />I think the majority of the series' success is due to the author's death. I think that's something no one's willing to say once a book (or anything) has garnered enough posthumous success. A good example of a book that deserved posthumous success: A Confederacy of Dunces. This crap should pretend to reach so high.
B0014DCT06|5.0|This is the most elaborate stage show I have ever seen.  It's more than just a concert.  It's a full on show.    The show has a full band, dancers, and Justin Timberlake in Madison Square Garden and was nothing less than incredible.      An awesome track list presented in PCM stereo, PCM 5.1 Surround, and 5.1 Dolby. In my opinion with the exception of 1 or 2 songs the sound was absolutely crystal clear and very well balanced.    I'm not the hugest Timberlake fan but I am a fan of music DVD's and this did not dissappoint.  Picture, sound, and entertainment value are all really high for me.
1883217040|4.0|I am writing this review to point out that Mark Levine publishes TWO Jazz theory books \\" The Jazz Theory Book (1995)\\" and \\"The Jazz Piano Book (1989).\\" Amazon shows incorrect dates for these books. I purchased both here on Amazon. To my suprise, the two books are virtually the same with frequent identical paragraphs of text, illustrations, chapters, etc. Jazz Theory Book is essentially an update version of Jazz Piano Book. Both are superior well written music theory works but it is not necessary to own both.  Either one of them is a must have for any aspiring Jazz pianist or theory hound. I am keeping the Jazz Theory Book since it is newer.  I feel that Amazon or someone should point this 'duplication' out.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Wow. How can a person describe all of the elements this film provides? You just have to see it.  The characters (Begbie in particular) were painful to watch, but I couldn't take my eyes off of them.  I found myself rooting for the protagonist, Mark Renton, even through all of the horrible choices he made.  I have never experienced a wider array of emotions during a movie.  It was funny, disgusting, sad, dark, exciting, bizzare and just plain awesome.<br /><br />I've seen reviews that say Trainspotting glorifies drug use.  That is definitely not accurate.  Perhaps a twelve year-old would watch this and think, \\"Drugs and cussing are cool!\\" (BTW most 12-year-olds should not be watching this film), but to an adult viewer, the destructive consequences of drug use are quite apparent.<br /><br />The music was exceptional and fit the ever-changing mood of the movie.  The scenery from Scotland is beautiful and provides a nice contrast to the depressing state of the characters.  In short, one of my favorite movies ever.  See it.  Whether you love or hate it, Trainspotting is an experience you won't forget.
B00386EZJU|5.0|When I saw the movie, I absolutely knew that I had to have the CD of the soundtrack when it came out. The music is thrilling, full of emotion. The arrangement is not a strict match to the movie but it is closer to it than many other disks produced of this nature. I highly recommend this CD for any person who loves music of this type.

B002DKGWSE|4.0|This sort of film is not for everyone . Having watched the evolution of horror filmaking from universal's 1930's and 40' pictures with \\"Famous Monsters of Filmland\\" (pretty much the only horror mag on the racks in the 60's and 70's) to the present , there are these things to consider when ellecting to watch modern (post 2000) horror .       1. These hard R or unrated horror films are certainly meant for adult viewing only . I agree with Roger Ebert that there should be a designation of \\"A\\" (for adult) for these targeted films .                                                     2. This sort of film is best appreciated alone or with a like minded friend or spouse . Seeing this sort of picture theatrically will most certainly sway your opinion based on audience , group and friend reactions following the film's conclusion . It's quite uncomfortable and often awkward to see such films with an auditorium of strangers . When you give voice to feeling that such a film was excellent in doing what it set out to do (manipulate , horrify and gratify you) there are bound to be folks (and a lot of them) who simply found the whole oddessy quite disgusting and pointless . It ain't \\"Seabiscuit\\" .                                                                 3. Don't look to mainstream film critics to clue you into weather this film and ones similar to it are your \\"cup of tea\\" . Pretty much exclude everyone from Rotten Tomatoes . Look in the right places . Fangoria , Rue Morgue and similar mags and sites . It's so frowned upon in the critical community to laud such films until at least 20 to 30 years have passed .                                                                                                            4. Lastly , know what you're getting youself into . This ain't your grandfathers scary movie . Scared the heck out of me . Lots of familiar faces and very compelling filmaking . Did not see wes's 70's pic but this'll do .
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is with out a doubt one of the most significant concert DVD's to come out in the past 5 years for any blues-rock fan! Joe B. lights up the guitar for this spectacular performance. He plays a few different styles, Eric Clapton being the main style he plays off of, that he acknowledges, and he incorporates his own style into the song set like a more seasoned veteran than he is. His guitar duet with the MAN himself shows this, I feel he outplayed EC on this particular song. That said, It's probably due to EC's age and his fingers just don't move as fast as they used to, in his prime, that might be different. The Audio and Video is as good as it gets for SD DVD. That dual drum setup is phenomenal, you hear each drummer in the L/R speakers as individuals, Really Well Done! If you only buy 1 DVD concert, this should be the one to get for blues-rock fans!<br /><br />I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.<br /><br />1. Performance<br />2. Quality of Audio<br />3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)<br /><br />1.*****<br />2.*****<br />3.*****<br /><br />Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a BAD product. Those who would still rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.

I was about 11 when this show first came on and I am 23 now, and re-watching the episodes I can see how much that show shaped my views on life. If you were a huge fan of this show (as I was/am) then it will all come back to you. Yes the music is not the same but in the end you can't really tell the difference. Great buy!!!

0399250395|4.0|I love this book. I remember it from my childhood and want it for my child. I ordered the pop-up edition and found the pop-up components were already damaged upon delivery.

I rate this cd as top notch, with the re-release of exile on main street it alot of people will be looking for one, why pay top buck when amazon has them at less than half price, and cheaper than ebay too.
0307474275|4.0|This is a very enjoyable read that just has a few things that bother me about it that prevent from being a great one. First with the good. Robert Langdon is back and there is an element in comfort in getting to know your protagonist. The only problem is, there is not much new to learn about him, he is kinda the same character just in a little different of a plot. But he is still a fairly good protagonist, the insights he presents, especially a lot of the ones relating to symbology. There is some interesting information on a lot of topics that is presented in here, and it is nice to actually have some depth to the story of the novel. Granted, at times, it does feel like there are some liberties taken with some of these \\"facts.\\"<br /><br />There are a few things that prevent this novel from being great. First, it is very frustrating that there are some really complex puzzles that our characters figure out very quickly, then get stuck forever every once in a while on what seem like trivial tricks in comparison. Granted, this is done for the story to flow and work correctly, but at the same time it can be very frustrating. There are also a few points in the novel where I feel Brown gets a little to hung up in trying to explain some elements to the reader, and it just feels like a bit too much at times. Granted, I would much rather have a bit too much than too less, but it does feel like a bit too much.<br /><br />Finally, the most important element of the novel, the plot, is a great thriller one here. There is a lot of action and a quite a few surprises all over the place, and they feel great. Most don't feel forced, and most of the time, our characters feel grounded. And if you are okay with a few shortcomings, the majority of The Da Vinci Code is a great and very enjoyable read.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I originally read a review about this movie that got me interested, and I can say it was worth the rental, and probably a buy if you don't mind the F-bombs. I knew what the ending was because of the spoiler in the review, but was still suprised by the added twist at the end. Very good work by Denzel, you'll be rooting for him the whole way.
0743201140|1.0|Sorry for the rating. The book is great. The only ratings I usually read are the low ones. So, the best place to warn people is with a one rating. Don't buy it used. It has a serial number you need to access an online test and it can only be used once. Chances are, whoever owned the book before you used the number.
0385504225|3.0|Here we arrive at Robert Langdon's third adventure. And while it was still a good one, there were a few more things that are starting to get in the way of really enjoying the novel as much as his past adventures. Lets get a few of the things that I did not like about the novel out of the way. First, it just felt too long. I enjoy a nice deep and long read a lot, but there needs to be enough to keep it interesting. And there are many times in this novel where that is just not the case. There are just some sections of the novel that feel like nothing is happening and I am just reading words printed on the page, because they are doing nothing to add to the story that I am reading. When I picked up the novel, I thought initially it felt kinda big, and I was excited that it seemed like it is going to be a good and deep thriller novel. But just a bit too much of that size was not really doing anything but rambling.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about some of the in-depth explanations of a lot of architecture in this novel. For 95% of the time, I really enjoyed it. It gave substance to the world and was presented strongly and completely which was great. It really gave me a clear vision of the world and a lot of explanations that helped to support the vision. Though, there were also times where some if it felt a bit unnecessary and kind of added to that element of filler words at times.<br /><br />Now for some things I really enjoyed about the novel. Katherine, our lead supporting female role in the novel is the best from the Robert Langdon novels. She feels strong, intelligent, and fairly independent. Some of the scenes from her lab are just excellent and among my favorites of Dan Brown's. I think I even actually like her a bit better the Robert Langdon to be honest. Mal'akh is also a very excellent antagonist in the novel, probably again the best antagonist in the any of Dan Brown's novels. He just plays a great foil to our protagonist's efforts and this whole novel is really a great cat and mouse game.<br /><br />The story itself is very good. Somewhere just below Angels & Demons and just a tad better than The Da Vinci Code. When the story is moving and things are happening it is everything I want out of a thriller novel. It is fact paced and exciting, and there is suspense and surprises. And really, the only thing separating this from a 4-5 star novel is the fact that there just feels like there is some filler stuff in the novel that just acts to dilute the greatness at the end of the day.cat and mouse game.

B000CNE092|2.0|This movie is nothing more then a expensive Disney knockoff and like Mr.Toad's Wild Ride,the only good thing about this film is the villain song.No comment on the other film. I give both films a 2 out of 10.
B002ZG997C|5.0|SPOILERS...SPOILERS...SPOILERS!!!!!<br /><br />\\"The Book of Eli\\" was an incredible movie in the sense that it delivers what it sets out to deliver...a tight story with exceptional actors and a quite subversive and bleak atmosphere.  I was faced with a dilemma in viewing this movie that I noticed only one other reviewer picked up on (he gave the movie one star).  If Eli, played very adeptly by Denzel Washington, had wholly memorized the bible, then why wasn't he applying the teachings in the good book to his daily life?  Why did he stand by in ignorance while a woman was brutally raped only yards from where he was hiding, especially if he KNEW that he was protected and untouchable?  It's not like he had to fear for his life.  He knew that God had appointed him as a messenger, and that His hand was covering him.  Protection is one thing, but why go around killing people when the very book you are safekeeping clearly states that murder is unholy and sinful?  Was there no way to talk his way out of those situations?  I'm fairly certain that God would have provided Eli the \\"gift of gab\\" just as well as he provided him the ability to kill thirty armed and burly men in thirty seconds.  There are more questions along these lines, but why bore you with monotony?<br /><br />Why five stars then,  you ask?<br /><br />Simple...this was probably one of the most entertaining movies of the year for me.  Here's why:<br /><br />1. Mila Kunis has really become quite the actress, and she is most enjoyable to watch, as she is in EVERYTHING she does.  Gary Oldman is perfectly cast and very much in his element, and Denzel Washington is top-notch as the hero in this unlikely role.<br /><br />2. All the questions in the first paragraph can be explained in only one way...the answer?<br /><br />THE HUMAN CONDITION<br /><br />Eli, being human, was so focused on the mission at hand that he missed everything the bible told him as he read it.  The saying goes something like \\"Can't see the forest for the trees.\\"  Doesn't that happen every single day to every single bible-guided person out there?  Freewill breeds sin, and within sin is the human condition to \\"Look out for number one\\" rather than put others before yourself.  Eli even told Solara that what he had taken away from everything he had read in the bible was to put others before yourself, but yet, just as all of us are prone to do, he didn't necessarily practice what he preached on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />So instead of focusing on the position Mr. One-Star review took on the movie, which is thinking that since Eli memorized the bible, he should be perfect, I choose to look at it from the next view AFTER that point-of-view.  Eli could only do the best that he could do with what he was given...for after all, HE WAS ONLY HUMAN.<br /><br />One more note of interest...HE WAS BLIND!every single bible-guided person out there?

0762759437|5.0|There are so many new restaurants in Brooklyn these days, it's hard to keep up.  I found this book easy to read and navigate. Written in a very conversational tone, restaurants are listed by neighborhood and maps are included in each section. I liked the concise, detailed descriptions of both the well known and little known spots. The author also includes \\"fun sections\\" about things that make Brooklyn Brooklyn (CSA's, the flea markets, Red Hook ballfields). I will definitely pull this book out next time I'm heading out in Brooklyn for a good or interesting meal or just looking for a snack.
B001HOF8AA|4.0|I saw Imelda May and her excellent band on Later... with Jools Holland and was really taken with them. She's a knockout and they are a totally committed band from the Teddy Boy looking guitarist on down. Watching them play and listening to this album, I got the sense that they aren't just trying to pay homage to early rock 'n roll and rockabilly, they feel it, believe it and practice it with their hearts and souls.  Starting with \\"Johnny Got A Boom Boom\\" with it's kicking beat and reverb spilling over was a real treat and the same goes for \\"Big Bad Handsome Man.\\" And then on to the dark magic of \\"Got your Voodoo Working,\\" this is a fine, fun album. Sorry, I mean CD. What i'm saying is it's got that vinyl feel to it.  The only tune I wasn't crazy about was \\"Smokers Song.\\" A little too frenetic and the chorus...   I was very pleasantly surprised by the slow tunes they do. Torchy without being saccharine and it seems like she just believes in each word and every note. It'll be interesting to see how she follow this.
0891419063|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is written extremely well. I had trouble putting the book down. This book describes in great detail the horrors and hardships that the Marines faced in WWII during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa from a grunt Marine's perspective. After reading this book, you will have a genuine appreciation for the sacrifices made by the young men, many in their teens, who fought one of the most horrific campaigns in U.S. military history. I have nothing but the utmost respect for our WWII veterans as well as all other veterans who have served our country and have fought to keep our freedom.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|Great great show. The packaging is silly, but its much cheaper than the better-packaged version, so who cares. Buy a sleeve-book to hold the disks and throw away the box if it disturbs you that much.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Good Points  1)The special effects are great.  2)Although forgettable the music works with the setting.  3)The art direction was cool.    Bad Points  1)The script sucked.  2)The acting sucked.   3)The politics are as subtle as a fully loaded freight train hitting you at top speed.    The next section will have what some may consider spoilers so sorry if I ruin anything.    4)Cameron was a nice guy and allowed someone who needed extra credit in remedial English, middle school level, create the story.While nice of him it does make the story unenjoyable.At the very least a little background on why unobtainium was so darned valueable would be nice.Sure humanity as waged war and destroyed other cultures for minerals but at least we know the reason why those minerals were valuable.In Avatar there is no reason given for why humanity needs unobtainium.As an aside I realize that my grammar sucks as does my general writing abilities.  5)It was much too long for the story told.The story begins with natives who live in harmony with nature and evil outsiders who are willing to destroy everything for a valuable rock.In order to interact easier with natives,I guess it might also be easier to work the environment,  the evil corparation created avatars that a mix of native and human DNA.One of the outsiders is converted to natives side while working as a double agent for the big bad leader of the soldiers for hire.Others side with the natives, people who you expect die, and the natives led by the converted outsider drives off the bad outsiders.Roll the end credits.I just summed up the \\"plot\\" of Avatar. The movie runs for,I think, 2 and half hours with this basic plot.   6)The way the aliens \\"bond\\" with well everything on Pandora has a sightly creepy sexually dominance feel to it. Although it might be the only remotely creative aspect in the story it still is somewhat disturbing.  End of any Spoilers.    It makes me glad that I wasted my money on the cheap no frills DVD edition instead of the full featured special edition. It does make me wonder if the missing footage holds the good acting and a half-way decent plot twist though.
0330449605|5.0|The book was average, at best. The delivery (prompt) & the condition (as stated) of the book was excellent. My five start rating is for the bookseller, not the book itself.
B001GCUO16|3.0|The story was a little confusing to me because it was never really revealed why Sabre Tooth wanted to kill Wolverine. Was is because Wolverine didn't want to be a killer like him?     I was kind of disappointed they didn't use the original Sabre Tooth actor, but the new one did an awesome job.     Like most Wolverine fans, I like watching the blades come out of his hands. But I think they actually over-did it this time with all the close-up shots.
B003PWPGT0|5.0|First of all, I must say I am in my middle 40's and have owned every album, single, side project, and soundtrack Tom has ever put out. Put simply, Tom is my favorite artist of all time. I'm so glad that Iam the age I am to have enjoyed his entire career as it happened.    On to the album. Easy. It's Brilliant. Yes, it's not going to appeal to those that like Tom just for his catchy \\"Free Falling\\" type of songs. But us fans who love Tom's experimental and deeper side, it's simply a gorgeous album. Tom can tackle any \\"form\\" he wants to whether it be pop, rock, country, blues, reggae. At the end, it's gonna have that \\"Petty\\" vibe no matter what.     My God, how gorgeous is \\"Something good coming\\", my favorite track. I tend to love Tom best in his more subtle music and the song exemplifies how Tom's style of simplistic beauty just lets it breathe at the right pace.  Other favorites are Pirates Cove, Don't Pull Me Over, Candy, First Flash of Freedom.    In addition, while Mike Campbell is relatively unknown to the casual fan and underrated in every guitarist mention. This is probably Mike's biggest showcase of an album. This is definitely a guitarists album. Kids taking guitar lessons, listen up. It's not all about speed and aggression, it's about tone and finding the right phrasing to match the song, and perhaps nobody is better at that than Campbell    Here's to Tom's \\"new\\" sound, I guess, but for us old-timers, it's not new, it's just......Tom freakin Petty.
B001NZ1IGG|5.0|I first heard \\"Apple\\" in the summer of 1990 with a friend in PA, I was under the influence (green) and I couldn't believe how MLB sounded so fresh and exciting... Like nothing I had heard before. Listening to Andy's voice is haunting; the pure lyricism and amazing musicianship of the band stand true today. \\"Chloe\\" is my favorite song, the lyrics are profound and poignant... I do not see a lot of the comparisons, MLB stands alone both lyrically and musically... See you someday Andy... Maybe.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie Lost in Austen only wished this movie was longer. I dont usually like period movies but it was a combination of the today and the period of Jane Austen.It has made me want to know more about Jane Austens life and her novels. It was on abc but missed it so i was glad to receive it quickly from amazon and was also pleased it had subtitles, and had about the making of the movie thanks very much I will probably watched it again and have recomended the movie to others.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|For me, the Blu-ray loses something compared to the IMAX 3-D; but it's still an epic story and a stunning visual presentation.
030745455X|5.0|The writing is excellent, there are delectable and detestable characters, the story line has a good flow and is complex enough to command one's attention. The overall concept and author's talent keeps one interested to the absolute final word.  I recommend this book to anyone who is not too lazy to read an exceptional writer.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said , I saw Forrest Gump when first released & thought it was Great so bought a copy from Amazon on Standard DVD with a good picture & sound and now again on Blu Ray Sapphire Series with a clearer picture & sound a winner of 6 academy awards Including Best Picture , released in 94 with a great performance by Tom Hanks and cast a PG 13 rated film and a good copy Recommended .
0307463745|5.0|The book, Rework, is one of the best books on managing technology.  Since companies are now in survival mode economically, they cannot spend a whole lot of money.  If they cannot spend, then large Information Technology projects are in jeopardy.  Large I.T. project genuinely cost huge amounts of money.  However, small and maintainable I.T. projects are easier to maintain and are more affordable to produce.  If they are more affordable to produce and requires less Information Technology workers to maintain, then the project matches the economic times that we are in.  In addition, the company does not need to invest more money into the project.  It is a win-win scenario.
0440237688|5.0|Very thought provoking read. Takes everyday life with a big twist to it. Great read for anyone over 13 or so. A book you can re-read often.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|Five stars without a doubt. It's like they picked up right where they left off. More in vein of their 80's sound than their 70's but really is that a bad thing, is there such thing as a bad Devo track, I mean really?! :)
1400052173|5.0|This is hand's down one of the best books I've read in years and I wish I could give it more stars. It is going to be difficult to capture exactly what makes this book so outstanding and so captivating, but I'm going to give it my best shot.    First of all I want to say I am STUNNED that this is the author's first book. She has poured ten years of her heart, soul, mind and her life in general in this book. What she has given birth to in that long period of labor is worthy of her sacrifice and honors Henrietta Lacks and her family.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I saw the Swedish film and was inspired to buy the book.  The movie was very intense and exciting--I enjoyed it immensity.  That said I was pretty surprised when I found the book rather...boring.  Luckily, I knew what would happen so I kept reading.  You have to make it through the first half of the book before anything really happens.  There is a lot of unnecessary exposition.  Details about Blomkvist going to a cafe for breakfast...where nothing happens.  I think 100+ pages could have been cut with out sacrificing the heart of the story.  That said, the exciting parts are very exciting.  It is gripping and the characters are very interesting.<br /><br />I will read the next two books, but I honestly enjoyed the movie more.  I also think the original Swedish title should have been kept.  The literal translation of the Swedish title is \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" which is totally appropriate.  The girl with the dragon tattoo--Lisbeth--is a major character, but the book is as much about Blomkvist.
0743298039|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is a story about two women. One is a famous author who's ill and whose life is soon coming to an end. Another is a young bookworm and bibliophile of a girl who lives a normal, simple life in her father's book shop.<br /><br />The famous author is notorious for giving false statements, made up stories, and lies to people who have interviewed her. But for some mysterious reason, she decides to write to the girl telling her that after many years of lies, she is now ready to tell the truth; the real story of her life, for the first time.<br /><br />Diane Setterfield needs to write more because I'm going to keep buying all her books! They're worth the money. Her writing is nothing less than exquisite. It has a gothic feel to it, reminiscent of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that I will definitely recommend again and again, most especially to lovers of great literature and profound writing.<br /><br />The story is mysterious, addicting, unique, and exciting. There are many twists and turns; you have to keep reading. I found myself lost in the book by the first page until the end. It kept me trying to guess what was going on, as I kept thinking, that something was just off here. In the end, when it all tied up and the ending is revealed, I was pleasantly surprised. I did not see it coming. I don't think anyone can. It was great.<br />If you enjoy a really good story with realistic, lovable characters, intricate descriptions, and events that will keep you guessing, try this one. You can not be disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just started this workout today, and nearly 3 hours later, I am stiff and sore all over!! I am 5'6\\" 185 lbs, and I know that I really need someone to work me like a drill sergeant if I'm going to get results. Jillian (as we all know and love) is something like a drill sergeant to the people on The Biggest Loser, and they rock their way through her insanely tough workouts. This video isn't quite up to par with those workouts, but they don't leave you lacking.     From the very beginning of the workout session, you're moving, getting your blood pumping, and feeling the burn. Within 5 minutes, you're sweating, huffing and puffing, and feel like you can't do another moment. By the end of the 20 minute workout, you can't breathe and your heart seems to think it's going to explode. As long as you stick with it though, it will pay off!! I hurt all over now after doing my first day, navigating stairs seems nearly impossible, but you can bet your a** I'll be back at it tomorrow.
0307588335|4.0|I had a very positive experience with this book.  I definitely recommend it.  I found it to be relevant on many levels.  First of all, it was enjoyable as it was paced well, and made for a rhythmic, \\"what's going to happen next\\" read. Secondly, I learned a lot.  I appreciated the continued definitions of all of the financial products.  Many books make far too many assumptions about the reader's knowledge base, or only explain something once, which when reading about an unfamiliar subject creates confusion and frustration.  With so many financial products to understand, the repeated definitions of their components and meaning was helpful.      I also found the book to be a cogent reflection on the subject of following a passion and the determination it takes to succeed.  I did not find the story of his rise simplistic, as I saw in another review; rather I found myself within his story of succeeding on a path that was not linear and certainly not promised to him. I also appreciated his reflections on what it is to have the intensity of connection he and many other people feel toward their chosen professions and the companies within which they choose to practice.  The decision to align oneself with a particular organization and the level of personal commitment that requires received thoughtful treatment in this book.  This very commitment, like any intimate relationship is as profoundly satisfying as it is the gateway to the possibility of absolutely shattering disappointment.  For these reasons, again, this book was not a simplistic treatment of the rise to success.    The only criticism I had of the book was, for lack of a better term, the vernacular language.  I appreciated that the book was unpretentious and highly readable.  I did not appreciate the continued and often rather forced seeming use of \\"folksy\\" language.  The same energy that resulted in a book about the financial world I could readily understand just didn't ring true used in this way and made it seemcondescending at times.    Again, I would definitely recommend this book. The criticism I had above regards a stylistic choice; the content was meaningful for me and contributed to my understanding of the elements that make up the contemporary financial markets.
B002OEBMN4|1.0|I have been a slayer fan since I was a teenager.I'm 35 now. Anyway,they used to kick so much ass. The riffs SUCK! Kerry and Jeff put absolutely no thought into the riffs. My grandma can do better and she don't even play guitar! They figured whatever they put on disc people will dig it because we're slayer! It's just all their old (easy) riffs recycled, and I used to worship these guys. They need to retire. Not one good song on this cd, did you hear me? NOT ONE!

B00005BL2A|2.0|Depeche Mode is an outstanding band, this cannot be argued. Perhaps with the releases of \\"Violator\\" and \\"Ultra\\" we thought they were perfect. However, this belief was shot down with the release of \\"Exciter.\\" I have tried and tried to get into this album, but have never been able to. It just seems bland and less than inspired, almost as if they were getting pressure from the label to turn out another CD. Like I said, great band, but this is not one of their better efforts, in my opinion.
0810971496|4.0|My son liked it a lot and did write on it, so it was well worth it
B000000WZ4|5.0|This is Depeche Mode doing what they do well, writing dark, brooding and hypnotic songs. Much more in the vein of \\"Violator\\" and far removed from the lackluster \\"Exciter.\\" When this CD goes in the player it usually stays there for several days and is played over and over and over.
B000002KD9|5.0|Neil Young has recorded gentle, lyrical folk/country albums and immediately followed them up with albums full of guitar-driven rock music, and vice versa. On this, his third solo LP, with the exception of the exceptional Southern Man, he returns from the Down by the River/Cowgirl in the Sand extended rockers to his folk roots. The 1970's was the heyday of the singer-songwriter and After the Gold Rush is one of the greats of the genre. Every song is memorable. I suspect that there are millions of us who grew up with this album and know the words to each one. And then there is Southern Man, boxed in between two gentle country songs (Only Love Can Break Your Heart/Till the Morning Comes),  atypical of the album in every sense - a driving rocker. Guaranteed to win him few friends south of the Mason-Dixon Line this song raged against racism in much the same way as Young's Ohio took on the murders at Kent State. I love Young's angry, aggressive guitar playing - it matches his lyrics perfectly.<br /><br />Listening in 2010 to the simplicity of this album and to Neil Young's admittedly unusual voice it is amazing that Gold Rush reached the top ten in both the UK and the US. I just cannot imagine that such an unassuming record would be as successful today. To prove my point let's look at Amazon's top ten this week. Let's see - The Stones, Eminem, Drake and, what's this - two by Sarah McLaughlin, a Carole King/James Taylor collaboration and one by Jack Johnson. Well, I guess I was wrong, Plus ca change...
B003954I9C|5.0|I have always been an enthusiastic BSB fan, so I have been patiently awaiting his solo album for years.  He, in my opinion, has the best voice in the BSB's and he really shines here.  A different and grown up sound.    Love it
1416955070|1.0|I read over 100 pages, nearly 7 full chapters of this crap. I finally gave up and chose something else from my library bag.<br /><br />The book starts out in a dance club, where Clary, the main character sees three other teenagers drag a boy into a storage room and subsequently kill him.<br /><br />Normally, if you saw someone being killed, your reaction would be to scream, yell, call the police, and generally have an emotional meltdown. Not Clary- she shows no emotion.<br /><br />That's the main reason I can't get into this book- there is absolutely no emotional pallet to color the action. Clary is attacked by a demon, her mother is kidnapped, and her mother's boyfriend tells her not to call him again. And through it all, she doesn't seem to be affected.<br /><br />When she returns to her apartment, after he mother's disappearance, she finds that everything they owned has disappeared as well. Furniture, clothing, her mother's artwork, every last thing in the apartment is gone. All Clary does is look around, shrug her shoulders and leaves. That's not a normal human reaction- it makes the book unbelievable and unreadable.
B0032JTV74|5.0|NOTE: PLEASE, please go to the website TV Shows on DVD. It's quite an informative site, and they are very quick to post updates on releases of your favorite shows.<br /><br />I'm writing this because (1) I love Glee, even if it isn't perfect (but what show is?), and (2) there is a lot of misinformation about how the show will be released.<br /><br />Gleeks, rest assured that Volume 2: The Road to Regionals WILL be coming out (the same day as the Complete First Season, in fact). Just remember that if you buy the two volumes instead of buying the complete season set, you won't get all the special features. But that's the only difference (oh, and the volumes won't be in Blu-ray; only the complete season will be in Blu-ray).<br /><br />Fox pulled a marketing scheme to get people to buy the first half of the season for Christmas, etc., thinking those people would then buy the second half later on. Because the show was getting so much buzz, Fox was anticipating the customers' crazy-passionate desires to have episodes of the show as soon as possible, especially since the show was on hiatus from December to March. It's almost as if the first half of the season was, in fact, a season all by itself. I think that's the second reason they did it this way. (1) People want it, and the want it NOW! (2) It's almost like two seasons anyway, so why not let people enjoy the first half on DVD in December, right up until the second half comes out in April? It makes a certain kind of sense, from a marketing/business perspective.<br /><br />I believe the initial press releases even stated that the full season would eventually be available. But some people were impatient. As soon as the first season was officially announced, people were up in arms, giving bad reviews on Amazon because there was no official announcement for volume 2. This was a bit of a faux pas on Fox's part, yes; I agree with that. So why did everyone freak out about it? Volume 1 implies there will be a volume 2. Just wait a few days before you jump on the \\"bad review\\" bandwagon, next time. ;-)<br /><br />See? All is, mostly, well. Just remember for the future that early adopters always get the shaft. Always. The first Nook? Not great. The first iPhone? Cool but not great. The first Glee DVD? Timely but incomplete. That's just how it works sometimes, unfortunately.<br /><br />In any case, I bought the complete season on Blu-ray, as well as the second season (this review was updated in 2012), and I'll be buying subsequent seasons.<br /><br />I won't write a review of the show itself since this is so long and I've already said I love the show. I WILL say that I really like when episodes deal with Kurt and his father, and I thought the final four or five episodes were stellar, probably the strongest of the season.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was absolutely beautiful.  The fact that it is true makes it even more profound to my heart.  I didn't know that I could be touched this deeply, this touched a place inside of me further than any experience I have ever had. And I am moved deeply everyday!  I was crying (sobbing) but it felt so good because the kind of love this story tells is not something words can describe, and I felt it during and after watching this movie.
0307454541|2.0|OK. I read this book because I saw the movie, which I quite enjoyed though they didn't seem to know how to bring it all to an end. Wonderful film. Don't miss it. How this novel came to be the blockbuster it is absolutely baffles me. There are apparently no editors in Sweden. Someone might have pointed out to the author that when people speak they should sound different. Maybe everyone in Sweden sounds the same -- a socialist education after effect. And maybe everyone in Sweden constantly repeats everything that has just happened, over and over and over again. This author certainly does. And then drifts off into nonsense land. Is there a page minimum for published books in Sweden? Is that why this book drones on and on and on?<br />I admit it. I didn't finish it. Having seen the movie and all. No way am I going anywhere near the second novel. And I'll wait for them to make a movie of the third. I'll go see it. And then, maybe, I'll give the third book a skim.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|I can understand that artists like to experiment.  I am glad that Tom Petty has reached such a pinnacle that he no longer has to worry about conformity.  I wish him all the freedom in the world to do what he wants at this point in his career.  But I must say that I am a bit disappointed with MOJO.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have always been a rock band.  Indeed southern rock, country western and blues have colored their music from the beginning.  Still they wrote and recorded rock music and whatever they do from here on I wish they had not strayed so far from the music they have been writing and performing for nearly 40 years.  Don't get me wrong, there are some fine songs on MOJO.  The opener, \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\" is clearly a blues song, but it is fun, it romps and it rocks a little.  The second track \\"First Flash of Freedom\\" though long, free form and slow in tempo has some beautiful keyboard playing by Benmont, and the lyrics in my opinion are the strongest on the album.  The song that was all over the internet before the release of MOJO \\"I Should Have Known It,\\" though very bluesy is probably the most traditional Heartbreakers song on the album.  Not surprising that they would choose to allow this one to be heard first.  The final track, \\"Good Enough,\\" penned by both T.P. and Mike Campbell is also a strong track.  Often the strongest songs on a Tom Petty album are the ones he co writes with his lead guitarist Mike Campbell.  Most of the songs though are simply boring.  They have the feel of a jam session that never really went anywhere.  I am a big Tom Petty fan and have stuck with him through all the previous incarnations, both solo, with the Heartbreakers, and as a member of the Traveling Wilbury's.  I always give his albums a fair listen.  It took me awhile to begin to like the last Heartbreakers record \\"The Last D.J.,\\" but now it is among my favorites.  Still I am saddened to see Tom Petty and his band become a straight Blues band after 40 years.The music is bland, and the lyrics to most of these songs are nothing special.  I bought the Mudcrutch CD when it came out a few years ago and did not like it.  Tom says this is the way he wants to record from now on.  This is one direction I am not sure I can follow him in.

0679720200|4.0|L'Étranger was written and first published in 1942 (in French). 1946 was the year of publishing the first English translation by Stuart Gilbert (who despite his French-sounding last name was a British author) - The second English translation was undertaken by Joseph Laredo and published in 1982. - In a very different style. This is the third translation By Matthew Warde... It would be interesting to read all three versions and debate whose version gives back Camus's words the best....      From what I hear it'd worth the time and effort.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Has some great songs on it.  This one is more rock than blues compared to most of their other cds - it's like a fusion of george thorogood and black sabbath.

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is a fable which follows the path of a young shepherd in search of a dream. This dream, both in the literal and symbolic sense, inspires a journey from Spain to Egypt through which the shepherd, Santiago, comes to understand the purpose of his life. Along his pilgrimage, Santiago encounters people who have not gone in search of their dreams, people who have failed to achieve their dreams and mystical characters who guide him in search of his own.  These characters give The Alchemist a very spiritual feeling, but it is a universal tone to which I think many readers can relate.     Coelho describes a deep and powerful message in a simple, yet elegant manner.  He inspires the reader to go on his/her own personal journey to seek out and fulfill his/her dream or \\"legend.\\"  Coelho also reminds the reader that the truly important part of life is in fact this journey, not necessarily the destination.     After family and friends recommendations, I read the Alchemist and I am so happy I did.  I found the story to be refreshingly simple and profound in a world filled with complexity and superficiality.  This story is an inspirational one that has inspired myself and others to always remember their passions.  I highly recommend this novel to those needing a push to follow their dream!

1843793792|4.0|Georgette Heyer is hands down my favorite author.  Her characters are graphic and the dialogue is clever.  There are so many things I like about this story that I can't think of which is most important.  She takes one back to the time and gets involved with the characters.  There is humor always on the edge of some of the people and the descriptions of costumes and morals and customs is wonderful.  I loved the book when I read it and wish there were more affordable audio versions of some of her other books.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|This is a great collection of songs. I love how the songs veer off in different directions at the most unexpected time. Petty's vocals are all over the place, which is refreshing. Not a commercial collection but worth every penny. This is THE SUMMER ALBUM of 2010.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Coming up on the one year anniversary of Michael Jackson's death, one of the things to be thankful for is this fantastic tribute to one of the worlds great performers.  I really didnt know what to expect when Ortega and AIG announced this venture, I mean everybody knew that Jackson didn't get to ever perform this show live in London.  I, like many, thought, uh is this going to be some cut and paste job not worthy of the King of Pop?  I should have known that with the singular Ortega and the brilliant Branca involved that this would be spectacular: I was not disappointed.  From the start you feel Jackson's energy and his genius, you get chills as he goes acapela or courtiously let's everybody involved know that HE is running this show and he knows exactly what he wants.  I think even if Michael had lived, the world would have loved to have seen this backstage, unvarnished look at musical genius in action.  The world lost an icon last June, but in this DVD, you at least get one last glimpse of this supernova before it fades to black.  Highly recommended.

015206396X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book about a young women named Katsa that has a most unusual gift.  Where this story takes place, people who have eyes that are different colors are graced with a special ability.  Katsa's ability is to kill, or is it?  Follow her along the path of her own choosing, something she thought was impossible.  This book can empower young girls. Katsa is strong willed and has been feared since she was eight for her grace.  When Katsa meets Prince Po who is not afraid of Katsa and who is also Graced she begins to look at her life in a new more hopeful light.  Travel along with them on a most exciting mission.    One word of caution some of the intimacy is a little graphic. That portion of the book will be covered up with paper so my 14 year old daughter can read this wonderful book.  If your daughter enjoys stories about women that can take care of themselves then this is the book for her.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|It is easy to see why NCIS is the number one show on television. Great storylines, great cast and just enough tension and humor to make it successful.
B003JYOFIW|4.0|On Tuesday, one of my favorite bands, Devo, released their first new album in twenty years, entitled Something For Everybody.  This is clearly cause for celebration.  Devo has been a huge influence on my artistic aesthetics since I discovered them in high school.  They always felt like strange messengers from a frightening four-color distopian future, where everything has fallen apart and the beautifully mutated populace of a broken America still needed music to dance to.<br /><br />Since Devo formed in the early 70's, their manifesto has stayed basically the same: the human race is de-evolving as it claims to get more advanced.  Therefore, we are all headed for a big mess.  The De-Evolutionary Oath that Devo debuted in their film The Beginning Was The End: The Complete Truth About De-Evolution was humorously complacent.  One of the lines of the oath is that \\"the fittest may survive, but the unfit may live\\".  Devo has never had much faith in our ability to transcend our simian routes, so why not have fun while the world ends?  We must repeat!<br /><br />Devo was founded by a bunch of riot-era Kent State art students. and their visuals have always been as important as the music.  Mark Motherbaugh is an amazing visual artist.  Gerry Casale has always been interested in marrying Devo's music with unique music video concepts and has become a music video director for not just Devo, but other bands as well.  The way that Devo presents itself for each album and their elaborate stage performances have always been as important as the music itself.<br /><br />So, how is this collection of new songs?  It's very good.  Is the album a classic Devo album, as strong and weird and innovative as Q: Are We Not Men? or Freedom of Choice? Absolutely not.  I have huge issues with the flat and uninteresting way this album is produced.  It sounds like it's from 1988 or so, and that is a shame.  To echo the New York Times review I can't quite tell what any of the new producers (including Santigold) did on this record did to update Devo's sound.  The synths and Marks lead vocals are all mixed flatly without much differentiation.  The songs still shine through, but the production leaves a lot to be desired.  However, is it this record as fun and dancy and clever as, let's say Oh No! It's Devo! or New Traditionalists?  Absolutely yes.  I love those albums I just name checked like a true Devo-tee and the new album drives through at their frenetic paces, all set to an urgent-synth beat.  The punk vitriol of Devo's earlier work has been gone for the entire second half of Devo's discography and it certainly doesn't return here.  However, we do get many solid dance and synth-rock songs that are written from the perspective of a bunch of smart guys who aren't getting any younger and aren't getting any more enchanted with the world they live in.<br /><br />My favorite track on the album is \\"Don't Shoot, I'm a Man\\", which sounds like an update of \\"Big Mess\\" or \\"Here to Go\\".  Here, against a bunch of snappy synths, Mark sings about scanning the rooftops of his city for shooters while driving to work in his hybrid car.  Eerie lyrical parallels to the DC sniper case from a few years ago make this an exemplary Devo song, one with a dutiful musical drive and heady lyrics, making you dance and think while you're doing it.  Devo also gets points for using the term \\"Don't tase me, bro\\", in an appropriately funny and eerie way.<br /><br />There are a lot of other gems on the album as well that I'm happy to recommend.  The single, \\"Fresh\\" cannibalizes the guitar solo from \\"Be Stiff\\" and is huge and awesome in it's sound.  \\"Please Baby Please\\" has almost an Elvis-style rock n roll feel to it's structure (this album borrows a title from one of Elvis').  \\"Mind Games\\" has a great 8-Bit synth-hook and feels like a sequel to \\"Love Without Anger\\".  As a Devo love song, nothing has ever come close to \\"Snowball\\" from Freedom of Choice, but \\"Mind Games\\" song makes some interestingpoints nonetheless.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are some total duds on this album as well.  I don't know how \\"Cameo\\" made it on here.  It's so, so silly.  It feels like an unused track from the pretty much universally disliked Smooth Noodle Maps.  The second track on Something For Everybody \\"What We Do\\", doesn't do it for me either.  The driving repetitiveness of the track and less-than-clever insights in the lyrics feel like the band on autopilot.  It's Devo's inability to cut some of it's less than funny moments that has always been a hindrance to it's later albums and it's still true here.  It would be a great thing if the bros. Mothersbaugh and Casale could reign in the precociousness every once in a while.<br /><br />That being said, the last three tracks on the album show a surprising amount of maturity and focus for the band.  \\"Later is Now\\" is a great song that is the thesis of the record:  Devo's predictions have come true and we are living in a fully devolved world.  \\"No Place Like Home\\" is another one of my favorite songs from the album.  In interviews, Gerry Casale has called it a \\"power-ballad\\", and although I wouldn't go that far, it is a surprisingly melancholy reflection on the destruction of our planet. The chorus states that \\"There's no place like home, to return to,\\" a sentiment that can be applied to our entire earth, or the more intimate concepts of growing older and dealing with change.  The piano-line in the song is beautiful.  So, if we can't return home, how do we cope?  We \\"March On\\", Devo's rousing conclusion to their new album.<br /><br />Interestingly, there is a bonus track on the album called \\"Signal Ready\\" that I really wish the rest of the album sounded like.  It's got a slimy synth feel, a lot like New Traditionalists.  Mark's vocals are all fuzzed out.  The song has a much stranger and more modern feel than the rest of the album.  Certainly worth a listen!<br /><br />It wouldn't be a true evaluation of Devo's re-introduction to the world-at-large if I didn't comment on all the other media surrounding this record release.  Devo hired an ad agency called Mother LA to market the album.  Check out that website, their text is completely bizarre.  Mother LA came up with the hilarious concept of attempting to make the album as appealing to everyone as humanly possible, hence the title, Something for Everybody.<br /><br />Internet users participated in two studies for the album, one was a color study that concluded that blue is the most universally pleasing color, hence the new blue energy domes.  The other study, a song study, allowed fans to vote on which songs they actually wanted on the new album.  There is a purchasable song study version of the album on itunes, but the \\"official\\" version of the album is only \\"80% focus group approved\\".<br /><br />Mother has produced a bunch of short films tracking the development of Devo's album and all of them have hit right with me so far.  This week, on the day that the album was released Mother LA hosted a live-streamed listening party for only cats (!) and premiered the first episode of a new web-based \\"reality series\\" about Devo attempting to create and market this new album.  This episode has a very funny part about Devo pitching their \\"everybody masks\\" in a meeting with their marketing people and record executives, much to the suits' chagrin.  The \\"everybody masks\\" are strange, faceless grey masks that allow Devo to attempt to look like everybody else and \\"reduce the petty differences between people\\".<br /><br />Devo are taking their strange \\"everybody masks\\" and their new costumes (inspired by Kim-Jong Il!) and touring across the country this summer in support of Something for Everybody.  They appear to be playing their songs along with a video track, just like they did with their Oh No! It's Devo tour in 1982.  The band has always been such a great marrying of sound and vision, that I am very excited to see this tour when it hits NYC.<br /><br />So yes, right now I am happy with Devo.  I can't completely recommend the new album just on it's own, but the new album along with all the media I've been assaulted with the last few months is a great addition to Devo's catalog.  As Devo grow older, they only grow more interesting and relevant.<br /><br />Duty now for the future.  Bombs away.ing this record release.

B000091OB6|2.0|Obviously this is one of the best albums of the 80s, and Queensrÿche's best album period. This was the \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" of the 80s, and it's by far one of my favorite albums EVER.<br /><br />So I was very excited to find it's been reissued on 180 gram vinyl. It looks awesome, the packaging is superb and the disc is nice and heavy. But there my concerns begin. The grooves are very shallow compared to other new 180 gram remasters I have from other labels. After a thorough cleaning, I put the disc on for its first spin.<br /><br />It's the quietest vinyl record I have in my collection, so much so that the signal to noise ratio is terrible. It sounds like it's been mastered from poorly stored original masters, and that the work was done by somebody inexperienced with the format. It's really a careless release in terms of the audio quality, in fact the original EMI Manhattan CD pressing I have from 1988 absolutely KILLS it audio quality wise, which is of course a ridiculous disappointment. Sure, I can hear a tiny bit more articulation in the vocals, a tad more vibe in the bass, but overall it sounds lukewarm and lacking in fidelity.<br /><br />Capitol has been failing at life for a long time now, and this is further proof. I will not be purchasing any more releases from the label. It's really a bummer, this is a very important piece of rock history that deserves to be preserved properly. I'm hoping this album sees a proper vinyl and/or SACD reissue from a better mastering shop (such as MoFi) at some point soon.
B0009X7664|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, as other reviewers have noted, is probably not only one of the significant novels of our time, but also one of the most important movies. It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time. It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place. Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book. Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision. The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.     The film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end. In this case, Atticus Finch is the lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with rape, knowing full well that it isn't the popular decision in the Maycomb community, and that ultimately, he and his children will have to pay for it through insults, gossip and general Southern \\"inhospitality\\". Still, Atticus sticks to his guns, and doesn't let this get the best of him, a lesson that Jem and Scout learn as the film progresses. Gossiping neighbors whisper, not approving of what Atticus is doing. Atticus Finch has several conflicts with Bob Ewell, a trashy member of the community whose prejudice is evidenced when he spits on Atticus, calls him a derogatory term, and then seeks revenge later. As a result of Atticus' strong principles, Jem, his son, and Scout, his daughter, see the world through realistic viewpoints (albeit the ugliness of society's views on race becomes apparent). The children endure taunts from classmates and even relatives about their father defending Tom Robinson and, as the trail unfolds, the ugliness of class and racial injustice surfaces. Jem and Scout experience a coming of age; their innocent world view is contradicted by these unsettling events. The subplot of To Kill a Mockingbird concerns Boo Radley, a recluse who lives nearby, but has not been seen in years. Rumors swirl about Boo, usually involving something to do with his apparent \\"craziness\\", but there is no real proof, and Jem and Scout are left to their own imaginings. However, a significant event changes their perception of him and the world; they are able, as Atticus puts, see things from another person's perspective.     This DVD is a wonderful tool also for any teacher who teaches the novel in high school, as the film is faithful to the book, including many essential scenes, so it is easy to read parts of the novel and then follow these with the film. Also included is a fantastic documentary which examines the making of the film, as well as interviews with several of the actors, such as Gregory Peck. All in all, this is one of the best films ever made, and a fantastic DVD to own.
0446563048|4.0|I met co-founders Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin last year and toured their main facility. The visit far exceeded my expectations. Yet I also knew that most fast-growth companies burn out quickly. My 27 years of surviving three \\"mergers\\" proved it.  None were worth repeating and left behind much collateral damage.<br /><br />I stayed in touch with the Zapponians after Amazon purchased their company, hoping that their acquisition would quell my merger-related cynicism. Thankfully it did. I even shared my video interviews with Tony on my blog to inspire other CEOs.<br /><br />I subsequently offered to review \\"Delivering Happiness.\\" The galley copy did not disappoint.<br /><br />You will notice two very compelling messages in this book:<br /><br />1. Zappos lives and breathes transparency. When Zappos cash flow hit an all-time low, he wrote a heartfelt yet direct letter to all employees. He solicited ideas to maximize gross profit. People stepped up. With a little help from Wells Fargo, they survived the major cash crunch.<br /><br />The Zappos Culture book contains no edits. All employee comments, positive and negative, are included.<br /><br />2. Zappos learned the hard way to never outsource their core competency.The eLogistics snafu taught them a costly lesson and they thankfully recovered from it. Outsourcing customer service--their claim to fame--was not an option.<br /><br />Some of the sections of the book felt superfluous, such as his passion for hosting rave parties and dozens of employee letters and stories. You can skip some of those sections and still gain tremendous value from this book.<br /><br />Zappos is a pioneer in the area of creating successful companies by building passionate customers and employee communities.This book officially marks the demise of CEO rock star mindsets and command and control business cultures.Hurrah!<br /><br />Be part of this corporate revolution and buy this book for every one of your employees.

B00117S4GS|5.0|Of all the monsters Supernatural has had over its 5 seasons, The Women in White still remains one of the most memorable. Supernatural can be watched without having seen a single episode thanks to the flashback in the beginning and the monster of the week storyline, but everyone should at least watch the first episode. It sets up so much of the series, tells us how their mother died, why Sam is estranged from his father, and what the Winchesters do for a living. Fans of urban legends, folklore, and horror monsters would probably be the ones to like this series the most. Hope you'll give Supernatural a try

1401323820|4.0|I liked this book because you can actually believe the story is coming from Castle's head. They don't tell us who actually wrote the book but its not hard imagining Castle dreaming up this fantasy, especially the sex scene between Rook and Heat. I'm kinda surprised Beckett didn't hit Castle with the book after she read it on the show. I think its a great idea publishing books under Castle's name to promote the series, just having him writing the books on the show would've been boring. Now we have a book to own by the legendary author Richard Castle. Can't wait to read the next one!
1416955070|5.0|I loved this book from the start.  I was so sucked in by the 3rd chapter that I finished the book in 2 days.  I picked it based on the \\"if you liked Twilight, you might like...\\" suggestion.  Loved the characters, loved the witty banter, great action.  It's much more fantasy/otherworldly than Twilight.  I have since read the 2nd & 3rd books in the series and am looking forward to books still to come.  If you like sexy, strong characters and aren't against the unbelievable then you'll love these books.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|It can be a bad thing too.<br /><br />I'd read this series with bookmarks. (I am reading it via kindle, which is nice for the bookmarking). I have found that I like to take note of when a character is first introduced because there are SO MANY of them that I lose track of their names.<br /><br />Now on the second book which introduces even more characters, I am a little annoyed.<br /><br />That said with a little patience (and maybe a few notes) this story is very engrossing, extremely well crafted and very (VERY) detailed.<br /><br />I do feel at times that there is not enough time spent on individuals and that the complex plots might be better served by fewer perspectives but that isn't going to stop me from reading the entire series.<br /><br />Which, I might add, I would like to buy as a set on kindle because the individual books are really expensive.
157421327X|5.0|I think this book is excellent for all ages. It really opens a true art for thse who like to doodle on everything in there spare time.  It takes you beyond the margine or the back of an envelope to draw on.  I recommend it, if you have artistic talent or not it just fun to Zentangle.
B001PJ7TUE|4.0|I think this is a really good record.  I agree that it's an impressive return to form.  However, I hate the mix of this.  I guess to keep current with the times, Liam decided he was going to put a ton of compression on the master, which makes it sound one dimensional and muddy.  I saw an interview with him around the time this came out and he said he was listening to a lot of Ed Banger stuff, which is probably where he got the idea.  That sort of heavy compression works well with sampled disco stuff like Justice, but really took a lot of dynamic out of a Prodigy record that would have been great otherwise.  Sorry, I can only give four stars.

Grasp tightly and unscrew the cap. It's a tight fit, with close threads. The pen writes well. Close the cap and screw it on.    When it's in one piece, be careful not to grasp it tightly in your fist and hit someone with it - that would hurt. A lot.

B00242KCWS|5.0|Contrary to other reviews, this cd sounds 0% like Zakk & Ozzy stuff.  Yes there will be certain similarities because Zakk obviously was an integral part of the song writing process on most Ozzy cd's.  This cd is brutal at times, melodic at others.  This is probably the most well rounded of all B.L.S.'s albums.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|In the interest of full disclosure I will state that I am not a fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. I watched this on whim through nextflik. Well tried to watch it anyway. After about and hour I got tired of reading subtitles and the movie wasn't that captivating so I shut it off. Maybe it got better after that point, I can't say, but I wouldn't recommend it.

B002ZG97RY|2.0|I watched this movie at a friend's house and I fell asleep about halfway through it. I was eager to watch it because I enjoyed the Bourne films (despite the constant camera-shakiness of Supremacy and Ultimatum) but this movie just wasn't that captivating. I was only asleep for fifteen minutes or so and I woke up to see the ending and realized I could have stayed asleep. The very annoying shaky camera effects are back in play for this movie, and to me the plot for this movie wasn't all that interesting. The whole \\"one soldier against the entire military/US government and the one soldier wins\\" is absurd. I think the acting was about the only good highlight. There were some parts that were interesting, but overall it was just a lackluster movie.

And though \\"Please Please Me\\" is far from their best, it's still one of the most beloved CDs in my collection - it's simply outstanding music.    Other reviewers have gone to great lengths to describe the sound quality of this version versus the remastered one. As a non-audiophile, I can't tell the difference, so I'm not even going to attempt to explain those aspects of the album. \\"Please Please Me\\" was nearly recorded in one day back in the early 1960s, and it shows. There is an energy to these songs that is missing in a lot of other recordings from that era. Rather than taking each instrument individually, the group simply played live and went with the best take. It's an accomplishment that most modern artists would not be able to emulate.    As for the songs themselves, there is no doubt that they are great. The lyrics aren't particularly deep or moving, but then again, it's the group's first album. There is a definite Motown influence, particularly in the cover songs ('Anna', 'Chains', 'Boys', 'Baby It's You', 'A Taste of Honey', and 'Twist and Shout'). But right from the start it's evident that the writing combo of John Lennon and Paul McCartney was on the way to becoming something incredible. Their harmonies and melodies are exceptional and even on the song 'Twist and Shout', they manage to outdo the Isley Brothers.    Overall, \\"Please Please Me\\" is a record from a time when the world was more innocent, when rock and roll was still finding its legs. A time when live playing was more important than studio magic. For that reason alone, this album will always have a special place in my heart.
B000077VR3|1.0|I have tried 5 times to watch this movie... however after 15min (my longest suffering stint yet), my gag reflex triggers... it just exceeds the cheese threshold for any normal human... Cannot believe the actors participating in this, they must be scarlet! Unwatchable
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I love Devo...always have and always will.  My 1st tape was New Traditionalists, I can still remember when they were on Square Pegs and I insisted the family tv be turned on so I could watch them.  Seeing them in concert a few years back ranks as a highlight.  However when I heard they had a new album I can honestly say I was disappointed that my former heros were trying to cash in as this seemed to be a very UnDevo like concept.<br /><br />I bought the cd despite my concerns and wow was I wrong.  It was like the guys never aged a day they are fresh today as they were in the 80's maybe even more so today.  Its like they found the fountain of youth or were recreated from a fresh batch of spuds, either way Devo version 3.0 is as solid of an album as they have ever created and can easily stand up to the great Devo albums of years past.<br /><br />Thank you Devo for not disappointing and making the long wait worth the while!  For any Spud Head out there Something for Everybody is a classic!

B000050FEN|5.0|This was still early in Brad Pitt's career, but as you can see if you   have seen this film, he was more than up for and capable of the task to   stand alongside the likes of Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow   (who he was engaged to at the time), all under the brilliant direction   of David Fincher, who he would work again with many times over his career   and garner some of his best & most acclaimed film roles.   This is a dark, fast, grissly, mind-twisting psychological thriller which was   disturbing to alot of people when it first hit theatres in 1995.  But it was undeniably a modern day classic out of the gate and many   copy-cat films followed in it's wake!  I could never say that Brad Pitt was   THE SINGULAR STAR of this film because it's filled with powerhouse performances   from powerhouse actors who created characters and moments in this film that are   now part of film history!  I was lucky enough to buy this 2 disc version for a very reduced   price from a secondary seller who delivered the goods, and it was   factory-sealed and brand new. (-:  Plenty of special features, behind-the-scenes, story boards,   cinematography, and other things which I like to have on films I consider   to be classics or bar-raisers in film-making history.   This films shows great in upgraded enhancement on my Samsung Blu-Ray and   1080p 40\\" HD TV with Bose Surround Sound DVD Audio System.  I could really hear and feel the dark undertones in the soundtrack,   as well as mids and highs that I'd never heard before.   Also, it doesn't seem as dark as my old VHS version or first DVD versions were.   I don't know if they tweeked that in some way, but I can definitely see a   difference from then to now. Overall a good buy on a great repackaging of   a modern classic thriller!   A win/win situation for me! (-:

He provides us with a sharper and more accurate account of both human performance and the human condition that is easy to digest and soak up. He shines a light on some good works from the likes of Deci and others around intrinsinc motivation. And peppers you with tangible examples of the methods in practice (ROWE, \\"20 percent\\", etc.). The catalyst of his research revolves around a simple yet powerful model-- autonomy, mastery, and purpose as the key levers to what drives us.

B003CN5SAY|3.0|But first, I'll tell you what was good about it. It won't take as long.<br /><br />I'm actually grateful that this was the final season. Too many shows linger far past the point where they've \\"jumped the shark.\\" Invariably, a good television show lasts because the audience comes to identify with the characters and the various players almost become friends of the viewing family. Nip/Tuck was no exception. Even though some of the characters made absurd decisions and exhibited despicable behavior through the years, the writers managed to make the viewers care about what these people were going to do next. Like other reviewers, I'm going to miss the denizens of the Nip/Tuck universe.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br /><br />I'm very grateful this was the last season. Within the first couple of episodes it becomes pretty apparent that some of the actors are tired of the characters they play. Worse than that, it is VERY clear that the writers had run out of ideas. There are fewer ongoing story threads in this season, the main characters are more predictable than ever, and there really aren't any \\"innovative\\" or unique surgeries. The \\"patient of the week\\" more often than not is there for common or mundane procedures that we've seen repeatedly in past seasons. The writing has also gotten very sloppy. There are some massive plot holes and even though the show has always been a bit over the top, the writing has always been top-notch up until this final season. I'm going to give an example or two of what I'm talking about in the next paragraph. It's a fairly big spoiler so if you have not seen this season yet skip the next paragraph unless you want to know about fairly major moments involving some of the main characters:<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT  SPOILER ALERT DO NOT READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON\\"T WANT TO KNOW!<br /><br />Kimber steps off a boat in broad daylight and is gone and presumed dead from that point forward. When Christian gets the news he tells Shaun that she's already been missing for over 12 hours. She had been with Christian the night before and then had gone to Shaun's afterward. She then hooks up with Mario Lopez on his yacht the next day. Christian also tells Shaun that she's been missing since \\"last night.\\" There is no possible way to fit that all together so that it makes any sense. Also, Matt is released from prison because Shaun and Christian do a favor for the District Attorney's Office. This is very shortly after Matt murders another inmate in the cell with him. Even though he has reasons for doing it, there is no way on earth he wouldn't face any consequences for killing a fellow prisoner that had connections throughout the prison. The inmate even had deals going involving the guards. These are just a couple of examples, but there are literally dozens to choose from.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS  END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />The final episode of the series ends with a whimper instead of a bang. Another reviewer already stated that regular viewers may be unhappy with some of the ways they wrap up the lives of some of the characters and I have to agree. Someone also mentioned the \\"couples therapy\\" episode as one of the best and I agree there as well. I love this series and I don't regret having purchased it. A weak season of Nip/Tuck is still better than most of the shows out there. But the characters deserved better than they got in the last season and the writers could have found any number of better ways to finish things up than they did. Instead they got lazy and it shows.had been with Christian the night before and then had gone to Shaun's afterward. She then hooks up with Mario Lopez on his yacht the next day.

B0000062FN|5.0|I hadnt listened to this album for twenty years till just recently when I picked it up second hand and gave it a spin.Memories flooded back and all I can say is will the real Carlos please stand up  cause the one we have now isn't a patch on the Carlos of old, give us back the old Carlos PLEASE.  If you like the present Carlos you may want to give this a miss but if you're wild at heart then this will show you the passion and fire Carlos once had, Neal Schon pushed Santana to the edge, dueling it out lick for lick and what we have gentle souls is quality music  still sounding as fresh as it was when they did laid it down.if you decide to give it some of your time I'm sure you'll find the whole album very rewarding.
B0030IIYWA|4.0|for this review, i have only watched the blu ray so far, so i cannot comment on the dvd portion, or any bonus material.  the movie itself is wonderful.  as an adult, seeing all the old toys will be appreciated more by you than children.  the animation is wonderful, and blu ray looks great.  the colors are very crisp.  the picture jumps off my tv and its only a midrange flatscreen.  the rating i gave is judging this as a movie, not a \\"childrens\\" movie.<br /><br />although i think this movie is great, this movie should not be rated G.  i found the namecalling with words like \\"idiot\\" and \\"stupid\\" unneccessary.  they could have either replaced the words with \\"silly\\", left out the word completely, or just rated it PG.  my 2 year old immediately repeated \\"stupid dog\\" to our puppy 5 times.<br /><br />then there is Sid, the horrible little neighbor who isnt so nice to his toys.  his character itself is disturbing, mean, and could be upsetting to young children.  the movie is showing how toys really feel, and here Sid is hurting them.  it may be a little difficult to tell your young child this isnt real, and the toys arent getting hurt.  again, just rate it PG.<br /><br />then Sid is playing with matches and fireworks.  the character actually reads the box of fireworks outloud saying they are dangerous, and then goes to use them.  i think this is completely overboard for a G movie.  i try so hard to instill the dangers of playing with matches and fire, and here this movie is showing a child go to light fireworks carrying around a box of matches knowing they are dangerous.  woody himself tries to light the match.  whether they could have made the movie as complete using a different scenerio, i dont know.<br /><br />G does not mean EVERYONE is going to like a movie, G means EVERYONE can watch it without upsetting even the youngest, most sensitive viewer.  although i watched this right next to my children, G rated means i shouldnt have to explain that the behavior in the movie as something we arent suppose to repeat, like playing with matches or namecalling.  for clarification, shrek and beetlejuice have adult humor, but they are rated PG.  dora, diego, max and ruby, and wonderpets are suitable to be rated G.as something we arent suppose to repeat, like playing with matches or namecalling.  for clarification, shrek and beetlejuice have adult humor, but they are rated PG.  dora, diego, max and ruby, and wonderpets are suitable to be rated G.
0743298039|5.0|Alright. I'm going to keep this short and sweet.<br />This was such an amazing book. The reader gets pulled in just from reading the summary. And once you're sucked in, it only pulls you further and further into the story. Vida Winter is a great character. Once you think you have her figured out she surprises you again and again. And you can't help but get involved with Margaret Lea either. Watching her story unfold is just as important.<br />Reading the book it's as if you're the biographer, writing Winter's story.<br /><br />This is a MUST read. And should be on everyone's bookshelf.

B002ZG997C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie on many levels. Yes, the spurts of violence seem to clash with the overall message but even that aspect is covered by dialogue and a nicely crafted story. The parallels between Denzel's character and Jesus (again minus the violence) and Mila's character to Mary Magdalene are apparent but handled well in my opinion. A big point off for the premise that apparently led to the apocalyptic times depicted but that grim world does draw you in to the film completely. Taking entertainment to a thoughtful level is always good and this film succeeds at that remarkably well. It points out that it's critical to define what's really important in life. There are no small things, just things we take for granted. (Next time I'm in KFC, I'm going to take a massive handful of wet wipes!) The reverence and reference to the need for faith and what life would be like without it is strong. \\"Finish the race, fight the good fight and keep the faith.\\"
B003H6Z0TU|5.0|This is going to be another easy review.  This is a great performance of this wonderful singspiel.  Right up there with my favorite DVD of this work with the L'Opera national de Paris conducted by Ivan Fischer.  This is a rare and historic look at the Salzburg Festival of 1964 with a great Mozartian Cast and Conductor-Istvan Kertesz.  Only do not purchase this DVD if you can't handle Black & White old technology and Mono sound.  Now for the review.<br />A) Sound - Excellent Mono. It can be a bit bright at times.<br />B) Video - Black & White.  Who cares with this cast and conductor?  And, the previlege of seeing a Salzburg Mozart Opera Production with an excellent cast!<br />C) Add the Vienna Philharmonic to the mix under a great Conductor-Istvan Kertesz.<br />D) Pamina - Pilar Lorengar a great Mozart Singer with a rich creamy voice and an easy top. I saw her do BUTTERFLY & FREISCHUTZ at the Met - what a wonderful voice.<br />E) Tamino - Waldemar Kmentt a heroic yet lyric sound.  Second only to Fritz Wunderlich in this role.<br />F) Queen of the Night - Roberta Peters.  The audience gives her two of the longest ovations; and for both arias they are totally justified.  By this time in her career she had picked up a little more weight to the voice and comes across a bit more dramatic then many remember.  I toured with her in Noel Coward's BITTERSWEET for the John Kenley Players in the early 70's and got to know her very well and have many interesting conversations with her and a whole chorus of great voice majors.  She was magnificent and told us about her experiences as The Queen of the Night.  She felt the Met refused to let her sing it after the early 60s even though she kept growing in it and was very well recieved in Europe.  Boehm loved her Queen and she got to record it for DGG with a very tight budget that only allowed for one take of each aria.  WOW!!!<br />G) Papageno - Walter Berry in excellent form.<br />H) Papagena - Renate Holm.  When have you ever seen the little duet between Papageno & Papagena steal the show and bring the house down?  Her and Berry's acting and singing of this win a major ovation.<br />I) Sarastro - Walter Kreppel - Excellent but not one of the great Sarastros.<br />J) Monostatos - Renato Ercolani Just perfect.<br />K) Production - Otto Schenk just wonderfully magical. I loved the animals with the Magic Flute. The costumes seem beautiful and colorful.<br />L) The Three Ladies - excellent voices and ensemble.<br />M) The Three Boys - Three wonderful adults with a 24 year old Lucia Popp as the soprano.<br />N) I wish it could be in color because it looks like it would be lovely: but, you can't have everything.<br />DON'T MISS THIS WONDERFUL LOOK INTO THE PAST OF A GREAT TRADITIONAL ZAUBERFLOTE!!!  THIS GETS MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION  AND IS TRULY A HISTORIC GEM!!!no & Papagena steal the show and bring the house down?  Her and Berry's acting and singing of this win a major ovation.

0156034026|3.0|I purchased the book for myself and my daughter who is in her first year of college.  I read an article in the Wall Street Journal Magazine on Dr Louise Richardson, former Harvard Professor who is not president of St. Andrews in Scotland.  She makes all of her students read the book.      I enjoyed the first few chapters but found it lacking in a story once the author focused on his relationship with a fellow student.  I continued to read on and felt confused by the relationship.  I did not like the book.  It was an average read and very disappointing in the end.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Face it ladies, who amoung you who knows the character of Darcy doesn't hold out some glimmer of hope to take the place of Miss Bennet? Well, in this film a young woman does that but certainly not in the way she probably ever dreamed. This movie is funny & filled with great jokes that can easily slip by so that on repeat viewings you can catch something new. There are moments that are poignant & heartbreaking but then others so funny it's hard to find room for them both. The story is contrived, but then that's the nature of the fairy tale, which this film is. There is an almost fantasy/SciFi element here but not really important. Accept the story & the things that make it work & you'll have a film that will make you laugh, cry & just be bloody glad you watched it. To paraphrase Cary Grant: \\" Everybody wants to be Fitzwilliam Darcy....hell even I want to be Fitzwilliam Darcy. \\"<br />Don't miss this one & enjoy!
B003274QH6|5.0|The bar that was set for television with shows like The Sopranos and The Wire has been taken up a notch with Breaking Bad.  Like both of those shows, its characters are realistically drawn and believably acted by amazing casts (as noted by many, particularly Brian Cranston's \\"Walt\\").  What seemingly began as a somewhat simplistic premise in season one rises to the level of engrossing thriller by the end of season two - and then to the level of Shakespearian Tragedy by the end of season Three.  The character arc of Walter White from complacent and defeated suburbanite to calculating criminal is one of the most rewarding rides I've ever experienced in any form of fiction (TV shows/movies/novels).    The reason I say the bar is taken up a notch is not because I think it's better than the shows I mentioned (persa).  There is a bit of \\"apples and oranges\\" in comparing any TV show to another.  It's because Breaking Bad easily on par, yet accomplishes its greatness sort of with one hand tied behind its back.  HBO has the freedom as a premium channel to be as vulgar or graphic as the story dictates... nearly uncensored.  AMC (who produces Breaking Bad) works within much more restrictive limits, yet feels every bit as gritty and intense as those other shows.  And I'm not sure that seeing the occasional naked person or cussing rant could do much to improve upon it (though I'm certainly not against either =)    Unlike in some shows, Walt's amazing character arc never puts the plot in the back seat. Too often that happens to a show of this type, making it devolve into tedious melodrama that starts to feel like a soap opera.  I love Mad Men, but half-way into season two I started to feel like I was watching Melrose Place with brilliant set-design (thank god it redeemed itself in season three). Except for the occasional humorous moment (and sometimes there are many), the show is definitely a drama, but it's punctuated with enough twists and unexpected turns to satisfy the most rabid thriller fan.  It's plotting is written near-flawlessly.    On another note, although the show looks nothing like a Wes Anderson film, its meticulous set-design and artfully cinematic look bring comparisons to my mind.  There is never a scene or shot that seems out of place or boring.  It also has moments of unforeseen action (think Bill Murray kicking the Pirates off his boat) that seem to come out of nowhere and lurch the characters and storyline forward rather than merely being cliché set-pieces which seem to be expected from a show essentially about criminals.    In case you haven't noticed, I'd highly recommend the show. =)
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This album is the best Ive heard this decade. It exceeds expectations, even for Nas and Marley.
0446563048|2.0|I can not believe it but after 12 years of buying my books on Amazon, I am compelled to write a review.  I found this book extremely creepy.<br /><br />First, I was disappointed in the flip tone of this book.  The preface includes a blurb about not bothering to have the book edited by a professional editor because the author did not find it necessary and wanted to continue to poke at his past English teachers because obviously he \\"showed them\\" by being a best-selling author and not bothering to be a conscientious writer.  I can not imagine having an ax to grind with a teacher I haven't seen in 20 years who may have corrected my work during my \\"formative years\\".<br /><br />Second, I want to personally apologize to every [...] employee.  How does one work for a fellow who prides himself on not hiring \\"talented people\\"?  I am dead serious.  Tony clearly states that bringing in talented people into the organization as it grew would cause the culture to change so would not be part of his strategy to build the company.<br /><br />Third, I also fail to understand how drinking with your co-workers and spending nearly every waking moment with them brings profit, passion and purpose.  Yes, team cohesion is obviously important.  The military wouldn't function without it.  Spending a happy hour with co-workers and eating lunch together for instance, makes sense.  Failing to keep your job because Bob in accounting doesn't like socializing with you after work, doesn't make any sense.  Failing to be promoted because you don't drink and (horror) actually go home to your kids at night, doesn't make sense.<br /><br />To summarize, I would re-title this book \\"A Formula for Running a Successful Cult\\" by Tony Hsieh aka The Big Pumbah because he has mastered the most important features of a well run cult.<br /><br />A sampling:<br />1. Alienation (Done!  Replace real family with new family - aka other Zappos employees!  Eat all meals together, work long hours, socialize with employees only.)<br />2. Us/Them Syndrome (Done! Emphasize the collective over the individual. Executed brilliantly by administering a culture test and immediately firing anyone who questions the company as arrogant and not a fit.)<br />3. Charismatic Leader (Done Well!  Name another Zappos leader?  Thinking, thinking. . .Can't?  No because the cult(ure) is the cult(ure) of Tony!  Let's go shave our head and paint it blue!)<br />4. Exclusivity (Done!  Private company.  Private goings on.  No nasty prying by Wall Street and no grown-ups (remember the missing talented types that were going to destroy them?) to correct us.  It's a Zappos' Thing, You Wouldn't Understand!)size the collective over the individual. Executed brilliantly by administering a culture test and immediately firing anyone who questions the company as arrogant and not a fit.)  3. Charismatic Leader (Done Well!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I have been listening to the Beatles since I was a small child. I own most of their studio albums and have listened to 'Rubber Soul' beyond countless times. So I saw this CD while cruising the net for a mono version of 'Rubber Soul' (which I've yet to find one reasonably priced) and ordered it.<br /><br />I finally got the album, put it on my ipod, and I listened to it through some nice headphones: The harmonies of 'Because' left me speechless. Then, a sonic tsunami (intro to 'Get Back') hit me: I can honestly say I've never felt completely awestruck by music before; I've found music to be beautiful and/or completely awesome, but the mixing job on this album just blew me away like no other. 'Strawberry Fields' on through 'Octopus's Garden' was an intense look back on Beatle's psychedelia. 'A Day In The Life' and 'Hey Jude' are wonderfully remastered.<br /><br />I've seen the negative reviews saying that this album is either blasphemy or anyone with a computer could have remixed these songs. On blasphemy: This album took me beyond any music I've heard before (conceptually and sonically). I don't consider that blasphemy, it's just creating a new sound with beautiful songs. On the remixing job: hahaha this one cracked me up...buy a pair of nice headphones or a decent stereo system, listen to this album on either, and then tell me anyone could have remixed these songs on a home-computer.<br /><br />In the end, this is a desert island album for me.<br /><br />5/5
B002B3D2TU|5.0|LOVE this CD. I hope David Garrett comes up with more of this crossover creations--absolutely delightful combination of mastery of classical elements, pep, pop, rhythm, and interpretation. LOVE IT. Highly recommended to both classical music lovers and ANYONE who enjoys music. Lovely. Great promise in this young man.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|Shout It Out is awesome. It has a lot of great songs. I would definitely buy it for a friend as a gift. Great summer album all the way.
B003CRM6QO|4.0|I last saw this movie on cable back in the early eighties and don't remember being impressed. i took a chance and purchased this from the local walmart and was pleasantly surprised! Picture Quality is excellent, stunning even for a catalogue release like this. colors pop--oh, those reds!-and detail is super sharp. I couldn't believe my eyes! sound is fairly good, surround effects are fairly excellent. As for the movie itself, guess I'm mellowing in my old age, but I got the campiness this time around and really enjoyed it. the supplements are not extensive, but the inclusion of the original \\"pilot\\" (for want of a better term) Flash Gordon serial from 1936 was ultra cool. Fans of Sci-fi, do NOT miss this one!
0385737424|5.0|Wow. This book took me totally by surprise, in that when I began reading it, I was expecting to like it, but not think it deserving of the Newbery medal. It wasn't until I reached the climax and magnificent denouement of this book that I fully understood why this novel won that prestigious award for children's literature this year. (Aside: I think at first, I was trying to make it something it simply isn't, comparing it too often to last year's winner, Neil Gaiman's \\"The Graveyard Book.\\" Finally, about two-thirds of the way through, I let go of this notion and accepted this one for what it is). \\"When You Reach Me\\" is a fantastic story, with an excellent blend of science fiction and realistic fiction elements. It is exceedingly well-written. Author Stead stays away from verbose prose, which makes the first-person narration seem like it was written by an actual 12-year-old girl (it takes a lot of skill to sound like a preteen when you're writing as an adult, I believe!). I loved all the characters, especially the main protagonist Miranda. The plot structure is nearly perfect, with all the first part of the story gradually building to a thrilling climax that (without giving too much away) had me in near tears and gripping my book very tightly! The ending was well-thought out, neat, and it made me yearn for more, as great books always do. I would recommend this wonderful story to everyone ages 11-12 and older (as younger readers might not 'get' all the elements of the story).

B0039ZF8D2|4.0|Nas joins forces with Damian \\"Jr. Gong\\" Marley to bring you a touch of hip-hop fused with raggae, and though I was skeptical about it, I'm very pleasewd at the outcome.  I am not very familiar with much raggae and only know of Damian Marley by name (not much of his music), but he definitely goes along goos with Nas on this one.  I have dozen or so albums Nas has oput out (solos/group albums) so I am very familiar with him and his work, and again he doesn't let you down witht his collaboration effort.  This one is definitely worth checking out.  With 13 songs, you get guests on 7, spitting a verse on 3 and doing the hooks on 4.  Of the 13, 4 are ok, 7 are good, the other 2 are near classics.  Production is very nice as well, as Damian Marley does 10 of the 13, whiole brother Stephen does the other 3.  Again, a nice album to check out from two of the greats at their genre of music.    #1 - 8 (upbeat track)  #2 - 9 (f/ K'Naan -- nice beat)  #3 - 8.5 (f/ Noelle Scags -- nice beat)  #4 - 9.5 (f/ Stephen Marley -- great beat)  #5 - 8.5 (nice relaxing beat & great 1st verse from Nas)  #6 - 8.5 (another nice relaxing beat)  #7 - 7  #8 - 7 (f/ Dennis Brown)  #9 - 8 (f/ Stephen Marley)  #10 - 7.5 (this one gets a little annoying)  #11 - 9.5 (very nice beat)  #12 - 8 (f/ Lil Wayne)  #13 - 7 (f/ K'Naan)    Check all my reviews
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The first 20 minutes is excellent. It told the life of an old man with no fuss. So touching! So moving! As a 40+ married man with no kid, this great movie really makes me think about my life and value more of my wife. Dont get me wrong. I like Pixar's \\"Cars\\" very much and \\"Wall-E\\" much, too. The little fat boy is by all means cute and lovely. I simply want to recommend it to all, especially elders, who have prejudice against \\"animated movies\\". In short, highly recommended!
B001NLKT60|5.0|It was due to the settings of my kindle. Later I figured it out and now it looks perfect. Sorry for the misleading.<br /><br />YY<br /><br />I finished the 'dragon tattoo' that is a hard copy. Then I order the kindle version of the 'played with fire'. However, I am not happy with this version. There are TOO MANY of squares in the book. Probably, it is caused by those Sweden characters that have double dots as their hats. But I am disappointed with the fact that kindle is not capable to handle characters other than pure English. Are not we in the 21st century? I can not imagine how amazon excuse itself on its incapability at process foreign languages.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I don't get all the negative reviews. Although all these people like the movie, they all have the same complaint; \\"Defective Discs.\\"<br />Mine plays wonderfully. Maybe there was a glitch in the production of this edition, and it was corrected, and the one I bought, was manufactured after. Maybe. Just a guess. So it looks as though I am one of the lucky ones.<br /><br />\\"Holy Grail\\" was the Pythons' first foray into feature-length films, save \\"Now For Something Completely Different,\\" which was nothing more than selected comedy bits from the TV series, faithfully reproduced on a sound stage, without an audience in attendance. Here was the first \\"new\\" product since the TV show's end, and despite all the trouble they had making it, it is, in many ways, their best work. It is SO dense, so layered, and dutifully crafted, it proves the cast/writers were far from finished when they did, per se, finish their TV run as Monty Python.<br /><br />Graham Chapman is wonderful as King Arthur, despite drinking himself stupid on a daily basis, but this is where he stopped, and tried to take better control of his life. As the others have said, Heaven is now a sillier place; too bad for us, cancer is nothing to trifle with. The thing which is so effective in Chapman's work here, is he plays the role 100% straight, seemingly impervious to the silliness around him. This harkens back to his \\"General\\" from the TV show, chiding everyone around him for being \\"silly.\\" There is a continuity to their entire body of work, and the astute fan always sees it right away. They have certainly created their own universe, one outsiders cannot comprehend, but those in on it, are enjoying it beyond anyone's wildest dreams.<br /><br />Possibly the movie's most memorable scene, is also its most gruesome. The sword fight between King Arthur (Chapman), and the Black Knight (John Cleese), is very well staged, and the gratuitous violence therein is belied by the Black Knight's complete refusal to admit defeat. Cleese himself has said, if the Black Knight acknowledged defeat, or even an injury, this would be THE MOST vicious scene in any film, and I tend to agree. Hitting someone in the shoulder with a heavy sword, and seeing their arm drop off, while arterial blood sprays from the wound, is extremely nasty, by any definition, but they ingeniously turn something as grisley as dismemberment, into a piece of classic comedy. This is something I have NEVER been able to wrap the brain around; I simply can't process it, although I understand, the members of Monty Python will go to ANY length to get a laugh, or at least a reaction, out of an audience.<br /><br />So, if one wants to risk a defective copy of this gem, I have no qualms saying \\"Go for it.\\" It is a genuine classic, with a lot of other bits to keep one occupied for a while.<br /><br />Graham Chapman is still alive to me.the Black Knight acknowledged defeat, or even an injury, this would be THE MOST vicious scene in any film, and I tend to agree.

1428144552|1.0|This is by far one of the worst books I've ever read (listened to).  It's completely redundant, repeating itself ad nauseum.  Not to mention the fact that it's very shallow and does not fully develop the ideas, not to mention the fact that there is not a unique idea covered here.  The author reads a sentence, then includes a clip of another motivational speaker basically repeating the same thing.  This whole book could be summarized in 1 concise paragraph, I can boil it down to one catch phrase:  \\"You create your own self-fulfilling prophecy, good or bad.\\"  I cannot fathom how this got published much less became a best seller.
0691142165|2.0|This history of 800 years of financial crises is based on the premise that financial mistakes can be understood by looking at numbers and little else.    There are no human beings in this book, only state actors as participants in the financial markets. (Some early modern monarchs are named, but only in their capacity as government executives.)    The authors accumulated a lot of data, much of which, they say, has never before been gathered and analyzed. Their data are exclusively financial -- debt, GDP per capita, government defaults, house prices, etc. There is no analysis of changing political systems (during the period covered by the book France, for example, went from absolute monarchy to revolutionary Directorate to Napoleonic dictatorship to monarchy to unstable republic to slightly less unstable presidential republic, and other countries have undergone similarly huge political changes in 800 years).    If you suspect that changes over time in each country, and comparative changes and differences between countries, in relative affluence, income distribution and income inequality, the identities of participants in the financial markets, the distribution of political power and the prevailing political ideologies, and each culture's and sub-culture's attitudes toward consumption, debt, and saving (such as between 21st century Germany and Greece), this book won't advance your understanding of how those non-quantitative factors affect the probability that a country's banking system will shudder or that the country will default on its debts to foreigners and (or) on its debts to its residents.    Of course, such messy things as political systems, cultural attitudes and behaviors, and the socioeconomic characteristics of financial market participants aren't reducible to numbers, and gathering such \\"data\\" would take unreasonable amounts of time, money, and wisdom. But the book blithely proceeds on the assumption that the analysis works with graphs and tables of apples or oranges or whatever supports the thesis. The book's charts and figures are usually more ambiguous, less certain than the accompanying text. The ambiguities and uncertainties are surely attributable to the lack of analysis of political and social factors not included in the authors' database.    The title is an intentionally ironic comment on the popular delusion in every outburst of financially irrational exuberance that \\"this time is different.\\" The authors try to show that of course this time isn't different -- just look at how quantitatively similar crises unfolded 20 or 200 or 500 years ago.    The verdict on their case is \\"not proven\\" -- comparing 21st century financial markets, national economies, political systems, societies, and government fiscal behaviors and monetary policies with 17th century monarchies is just silly.    Sometimes the authors want to have it both ways. They say, \\"The connection between stock prices and future economic activity is hardly new\\" (p. 262), and they devote a page to fortifying that argument. Yet only 12 pages earlier they say, \\"False signal flares from the equity market are, of course, familiar. As Samuelson famously noted, 'The stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions.' Indeed, although global stock markets continued to plummet during the first part of 2009 (past the end date of our core data set), they then rose markedly in the second quarter of the year, though they hardly returned to their precrisis level.\\" (Page 250 or page 262? You pays your money and you takes your choice.)    Financial journalists have praised this book to the skies and beyond; they are the same financial journalists who persist in attributing the behavior of financial markets to \\"investors\\" even though they know, in another part of their mind behind some impenetrable firewall, that two-thirds or more of all financial market activity is driven by computers programmed to make a fast buck, nothing more. Numerical data are easy to understand, easy to deal with. That doesn't mean they tell you anything worthwhile about what's going to happen tomorrow, because the next time will be different -- different politics, different societies, different cultures, different markets.
0515141429|5.0|As a fan of fictional characters who develop and progress from story to story, the first Jack Reacher novel has me hooked.  In my library, prior to my Kindle days, you can find John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series; Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series; and the grand daddy, Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade.  \\"The Killing Floor\\" gave me the sense of a character of depth with his own set of values in a world that is not fair or necessarily kind to its inhabitants.  The writing style is sparse yet sufficient to set a visual stage and populate it with colorful characters of interest.  I look forward to the next in the series - downloading today!

1416550518|5.0|Ninety-eight year old Grace's memories of a shattering event that occurred in 1924 at Riverton Manor reawaken as she is interviewed by a director who is making a film of the event. Grace was fourteen when she began working as a housemaid at Riverton for the aristocratic Hartford family. From her position she watches the family, especially daughters Hannah and Emmeline, as they mature from young girls at the outset of WWI to complex young women experiencing the changes of the roaring twenties. Guilt ridden, the aging Grace reveals secrets that she has carried about what happened that tragic evening at Riverton. Full of atmosphere and interesting characters, this novel is an enjoyable read.
B00337KMAA|5.0|In my opinion, this was the best film of 2009. The story is really good, so compelling and subtle, it's the type of film that feels great when watched for the second time. The acting of the leads is great, making the characters so believable. This film is an adaptation of a book by the same title, and you would be impressed if you read the book, they are so apart, and at the same time they feel the same, I think this film is a great example of how to make a proper adaptation. It's about what the story is about, and not about the moment to moment exactness of the adaptation. Kudos to the screenwriters, this should become a film to study to learn how to make a proper adaptation!
0375507507|5.0|Fuller describes her African childhood in detail, from the death of her sibling to playing in the wild. Her British parents rather liked living in remote locations such as Zimbabwe and brought their daughters with them. At some points in the book, it is hard to believe that the story of Fuller's very amazing upbringing is true.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I am a long time fan of BBC's nature documentaries and own many of them.  When I saw \\"Life\\", I snapped it up.  It is clearly a charlatan effort to make money rather than an attempt to create a first rate documentary.  Specific issues:  1) They show a large percentage of the sequences two or three times so you really don't get 4 disks of material - more like 2 1/2.  2) The sequences in each subtital are more like disparate scenes rather than unified to tell a story.  3) Oprah may be great on talk TV, but she talks in a monotone and isn't a good narrator for the series.  I wish I hadn't bought it and recommend that you don't.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this at The Screening Room and this documentary blew me away!  The film covers everything you could possibly want to know about the band, their family members, their personal thoughts, influences, etc.  You name it, it's covered.  Even Neil Peart participated just as much as Geddy and Alex.  The film even covers the band's clothing styles!  The various interviews begin with explanations of their upbringing, family history, how they all came to know each other, etc.  There's also a plethora of extra knowledge, footage, images and more that I guarantee will take you by surprise... things that even the greatest die-hard Rush fans have never been exposed to.  This isn't your typical dull documentary.  There's a great deal of humor spread throughout and many moments that literally make you laugh out loud.  As if all this isn't enough, there are many moments where various musicians and celebrities share their thoughts on so many different aspects of Geddy, Alex, Neil and Rush in general.  This is a top-notch documentary.  Be sure to buy it as soon as possible!
B001JFZ118|2.0|The extended \\"Director's\\" aka \\"International\\" cut of the film is all well and good, but I am still looking for the original US theatrical cut of the film with the excellent pacing and the trimmed down story.    I know that DVD came out back in 1995 / 1996 when DVDs were still new and since then its never resurfaced.    I bought the Immortal Edition DVD in hopes of getting the US theatrical release as one might expect when something is billed as \\"The Definitive Release of the film\\".  Alas I was lied to and the US theatrical release was not present.    In the age of Bluray discs capable of 50GB or storage capacity, one would think that a disc containing both versions of the film was possible.  Apparently not...

B001HN69AY|4.0|Watching this movie was extremely depressing for me because Heath Ledger was and still is my all time favorite actor.<br />I have seen all of this movies and the television shows that he played in and can proudly say that I am a truly devoted fan.<br /><br />This movie, although depressing, was created very well.<br />I loved the special effects and the choice of actors.<br /><br />What I didnt like (and what obviously could not be helped) was how Heath Ledger was the major character through the first half of the movie than all of a sudden he was no longer there. Poof!<br /><br />Instead they covered his \\"disappearance\\" with Colin Farrell which was noticed... Though I know it wasn't suppose to be noticeable; it was. Very. Noticeable.<br /><br />I did notice that after the death of Ledger, the story line drastically changed as well.<br />What I thought was forming into a love story or whereabout turned into a sadistic mind mending weird... thing with no plot.<br />Don't change the movie just because you lost an actor.<br /><br />If Ledger had lived to finish this movie, it would have been spectacular and would have won many many awards.<br /><br />Other than those unfortunate points, the movie was well made, well written, and well casted.<br />I liked it.<br />But not as much as I thought I would, mind you.<br /><br />Rest in peace Heath.<br />&lt;3
B0002KVULG|5.0|Probably the most compelling Dracula yet made, with certainly some of the most interesting and suggestive details in the storytelling.    Let's just take the obvious metaphor of eating.   There are some good questions here that should be addressed.       I can't be the only person to have noticed that Van Helsing places FIVE quarters of the supposedly single sacrificial host into the coffin dirt... were there two hosts, three quarters of which were eaten by the persons there, making them Eucharistic \\"ministrants?\\"   Does a magical quarter host come out of nowhere?   Let's say there was no magic - the five quarters come from two hosts, one of which we simply weren't shown - nothing wrong with that - meaning the rest of the second host was eaten on the spot?  In other words, the rite is a Holy Communion, which only makes sense to use the host for, since there is in fact no such thing as the use of a host for the purpose Stoker proposes.   Therefore, the host quarters are for eventual consumption... as part of the same rite in which they were distributed; such a use does not require a Eucharistic Minister to have already been appointed; the hosts can wait until they are used, preferably soon of course.  Other critics have already observed that there could never be the \\"dispensation\\" Stoker's Van Helsing claims he has, to use the host to ward away evil - but perhaps if it were certain the hosts would be found by the correct party or parties, might an exception be made for the purpose of the delivery of the host to Celebrants unable to attend... perhaps due to illness?   It is at least more in line with Catholic practice... or that of the Church of England.   For Van Helsing has children, therefore he is either a married priest, i.e., C of E, or he is a lay Catholic, performing an extension of the duties of a Eucharistic Minister, for example one who brings the host to the site, but does not know how many attendees there will be, therefore leaves the host unbroken untilready for use?   And if it is in fact not a lie that the soil is holy, then leaving the hosts there is perhaps not out of line?   (Or is the dirt we are told is holy meant to be eaten?   Rather a stretch, but I remember eating tar off the hot street with my friends as a kid... we thought it was a bonding... therefore, it was a bonding...) (Don't worry, I'm not going to say that sniffing glue together can be a bonding experience.   I didn't say that.)  Must we believe that everything he says that might damn Dracula must be a lie on his part?       Next question, are the hosts for consumption by one person five times?   Or by five people?   Assuming one Mass per host, the usual practice, the answer would be, by five people, one time, each, and not necessarily together.   Two bits in one Mass is not illegal, if part of the same ceremony, sometimes the bit breaks as it is delivered to the mouth, or a celebrant takes a couple of bits and puts them in the mouth.  So some lenience in the number of recipients would be in order (if any of this speculation is in order).   But the usual fact is that there is only supposed to be one Mass per delivery of the host by the Eucharistic Ministers.   So, probably, we are being told, there are FIVE other recipients.   Who are they?   Not the celebrants or ministers... some other five, who are not there for the ceremony.   Next item, what is the total company of Eucharistic Ministers - for there is no reason that more than one person cannot do the work.   Who is the one doing the transporting of the host (or, if this is two-stage delivery by Eucharistic Ministers, the remaining stage or stages of the transporting)?   Whoever carries the coffin?   Or perhaps the ship's captain?   And speaking of the ship's captain, could this a wedding, something ship's captains are allowed to perform?   Is the soil a Rumanian Embassy?   None of this speculation is meant to be of some kind of \\"Black Mass,\\" whatever that is - merely a series of exceptionsto known Orthodoxy.    More conventionally, the theme of eating is worked into the nature and actions of many characters, notably Dr. Seward, who is almost always eating his sweets, popping those little pills at moments of need, or enthusiastically eating some meal, even on his feet, while walking through a door.   What is this supposed to suggest?   It certainly is not normal - it is clearly an eating disorder.   He takes those pills to reassure himself, apparently absent-mindedly, they are his habitual \\"security blanket.\\"  Is he somehow participating in the same strata of exceptional Eucharistic delivery?   Whether there could ever be a real religious case made, in terms of the way literature works, this is clearly the case.   Perhaps Dr. Seward is one of the ones enjoying the fruits of the exceptional Eucharist - he certainly is the most evident candidate for this.   Hey, I didn't bring the idea of the Eucharistic in - I only saw the five when we were seeming to be told there were four quarters.    There is also the question of Dracula himself as food - isn't that a giant fishhook with which Van Helsing impales him, dragging him into the sunlight?   Where we can clearly see he gets cooked?   Dracula as a fish, drawn up on a hook?   Hey, that makes Van Helsing a \\"Fisher of men,\\" just what Christ said he wanted to make of us...   un-Orthodox, yes, contrary to what we usually understand as the spirit of holy writ, but not to its letter.   Oops, I seemed to forget, Christ invited us to eat him... maybe there is letter AND spirit going on here.   And if, willingly or not, Dracula is himself the Eucharist, then can he be so bad?   Is this why he gets to fly away - because there is a whole dimension to the story that only close analysis can reveal?   Certainly, Seward understands more than he lets on.   And what does Renfield know that makes him willing to eat bugs?
076781326X|5.0|This is definitly the best musical I have EVER seen. Sometimes you can tell with the older films that they were made a while ago, but Oliver! isn't one of them. As soon as the music starts, you are captivated and riveted to your seat. Awesome performance by Shani Wallis, Jack Wild and Ron Moody. I personally think that Oliver Reed could've done a better job. Mark Lester was a little too young to do a good acting job, but he was so cute and had the perfect look for Oliver. The choreography in this film makes me shake my head every time. Onna White really did a fantastic job on it. My favorite songs are \\"Consider Youself\\", \\"I'd do Anything\\", \\"Pick a Pocket\\", and \\"Oom Pah Pah\\". All of the songs were brilliant. The words, the music...I could go on and on all day.   WATCH THIS MUSICAL!
B00005JKZ3|5.0|Great movie--good story line.  While you don't see as much of Tommy Lee Jones as you did in the first movie, Will Smith does a bang up job and his partner is unexpectedly good as well.  We'll watch this one over and over.
B001BPJJ1E|4.0|I read some of the reviews people had created before me so when I bought this DVD I expected the quality to be much worse. Frankly, the picture wasn't that bad. There are little, white flakey things that flicker but you really don't notice them unless you are looking for them. And there was one part, when Melody and Daniel are eating in the graveyard, that there is a big white line down the center of the screen. The sound quality wasn't very good, but I expected that, too. I'm a huge Jack Wild fan, so I don't really care about the quality as much as others might.   I don't know what this movie is rated but if you want if for a family movie, There are a few things you should be aware of: 1. some school boys (early in the film) look at some pornographic magazines. 2. A boy is also found by his mother painting naked women's torsos. 3. A group of boys are smoking outside briefly. 4. a group of girls talk about kissing. 5. a teacher asks a boy is he's been drinking. 6. a couple of boys try to get into a girl's restroom.   Besides the above, the film is a good family movie, very sweet.
B0025KW29U|5.0|I have to admit, I got this because I'm a Fillion and Firefly fan.    It's cool to see Nathan expand into music and over the top melodrama but the real treat is Neil. He is a natural born entertainer. The outtakes of him are worth the price of the disk alone. Neil has erased whatever lingering trace of subliminal homophobia I might ever have had. When he's gone(hopefully a long time from now and after a lot more performances)he'll be remembered as one of the greats. I know that now.

0307594777|5.0|So, finally finished \\"Hornet's Nest\\" the last of the \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" trilogy. As is typical the first was the best, deep character development as well as intriguing story line. \\"Played with Fire\\" the second was an action thriller and page-turner, made the protagonist Lisbeth Salander larger than life, brought the villains into sharp focus.<br /><br />Semi-spoiler alert: \\"Hornet's Nest\\" fails on three levels- first and foremost too little Salander. Second, nastiest villains not part of most of this plot, flimsy corrupt government guys not compelling. Stieg Larsson, or since this was published posthumously, maybe editors got preachy about feminism and political conspiracies. Yawn. Third, Larsson didn't build on nor weave into this last story the wonderful relationships formed in \\"Tatoo\\", watered down at best. Bottom line- more Salander, better book.  I will miss her.
0312330537|3.0|I found the book quite entertaining.  By far the best aspect of the book is the sense of India you get from the book.   The author clearly loves India and its people and romantizes their lives greatly.  I was ready to take my next vacation to the slums of Mumbai!     Ultimately, the book is a like an old movie serial.  Each chapter is a different serial with over the top action.  Roberts writes action sequences quite well.  But they're very much in the Hollywood action sequence vein (think Indiana Jones).  They're fun to read, but not ultimately believable.     My biggest gripe is that after 900+ pages, the book doesn't end so much as it just stops.  There's a virtual \\"to be continued\\" after the last sentence.  When I went to Roberts' website, I found that this book is the 2nd in an envisioned Shantaram trilogy.  I felt gypped by the non-ending after investing that much time in the book.     I think the book also imagines itself as having some great insights into humanity and spirituality.  For me, there was never any payoff to all these thoughts and ultimately it seemed like a lot of posturing.     As long as you go into the book just expecting a good (though extremely long) action story, you probably won't be disappointed.
6303020089|1.0|In this film, Harrison Ford becomes the second coming of Superman. The film requires not only a complete suspension of disbelief but a suspension of intelligence also (like most Sylvester and Arnold movies...). That HF survives the jump from the top of the dam without a scratch is totally unbelievable, but apparently the writers needed this kind of nonsense to sell the script.     I bought the film because I'm a fan of Tommy Lee, who always imbues a part with intelligence and warmth. Compare his performance with Ford's usual wooden acting (with a lisp no less...).    To watch HF escape from one impossible situation after another, is boring, and ultimately actually funny. Dig the scene where he is walking down a dark road, and a pretty woman stops her car and asks \\"Do you need a ride\\". Now that's real believable, eh?    In the light of all that follows, you wonder why HF couldn't subdue the ONE ARMED MAN who killed his wife. Oh right, SuperFord SHOULD have been able to do it, but there would have been no movie (and I, for one, would be grateful!!!!). And he must have had an inexperienced Legal Aid attorney, who couldn't establish reasonable doubt, to have been convicted in the first place. Beautiful, wealthy Sela Ward? So much in love? He was rich, but she was richer...not exactly a believable motive.    After he sneaks into a hospital to search out the truth (posing as a janitor), he is asked by a female doctor to wheel a black boy who is having trouble breathing to an operating room (bet than happens a lot). Then he looks at the boy's x-ray for a few seconds, decides he has been misdiagnosed, and changes the boy's chart for a change of treatment. Of course, he saves the boy's life. All in a day's work for SuperFord. Man I wish he was available to clean up the oil spill in the Gulf!!!! This guy makes Welby, Kildare, Casey, and Jonas Salk look like first year interns!!.    Then, of course, the topper. He exposes his fellow worker who falsified documents and switchedtissue samples just so his new drug could be approved by the FDA (\\"No side effects\\". Oh come on. Even I don't believe that...) and he could make millions of dollars. A straw man, the surest indicator of cheap, amateurish writing.    As I said this is only for diehard Ford fans who have to own EVERY movie he made. I'm a big fan of Tommy Lee, but the film is so stupid, I have a hard time sitting through it....
B00000I3JM|5.0|The first time I heard this album, it was cloudy outside and I was living away from home. I needed to get out of the house for a while, so I borrowed this album from my roommate and went for a long drive. The music on this album moved me to tears. I've listened to so many moody sophista-pop groups from the 1980's, but the Blue Nile was different than the rest. Paul Buchanan's voice left a strong impression on me, the way he writes/sings about things really moved my heart and it still does.
B003IVDPC8|5.0|This album is utterly fantastic!  James Taylor and Carole King stick strictly to the song styling from their original recordings, which was very appreciated by the folks at the Troubadour and by me.  No variation from their true voices and style at the time these songs came out.  Tapestry in 1970 and Sweet Baby James in 1971, and the The Best Of J.T. in 1977... I surely miss the days of \\"Underground Radio\\" and Peace, Love and Understanding (What's so wrong about it?)  I saw J.T. recently, and he started in on his soul, blues vocal riffs - which he loves to do but definitely can't pull off (IMHO).  Left me feel cheated and cold.<br /><br />I remember when these two albums were playing on the radio back in the halcyon days directly following Woodstock, and after buying these two vinyl LPs we kept them in heavy rotation.  I still have the originals to this day.  There was sooo much good music back then.  You could turn on an FM station and leave it on all day. There was such a diversity of music it was like an aural gold mine that broadened your mind and soul with it's poetry, music, honesty and love.  This was a magic time in music when artists actually played musical instruments and Studio voice correction was a blight not yet visited upon us.  Music had yet to be sold in \\"marketable units\\" by uber-businesses instead of by major labels that respected the truly talented artists of the day. It seemed like every concert that came to Philly was a good one.  \\"It was the best of times, it was the best of times.\\" *wink*<br /><br />Buy it and enjoy it.  I am going to buy the CD/DVD as well.  These days I buy All of my music from Amazon, and have done so ever since they started selling MP3 downloads.  To the 7th level of Hades with iTunes and their price gouging and DRM hi-jinks.  I have a huge pre-Amazon inventory of iTunes DRM music which I can't share with anyone else.  When Vinyl was King, you could let your friends borrow your stuff and turn them on to it so that 9 times out of 10 they would go out and buy their own copy ('cause you'd be hounding them to give it back!).  And while it's true that you can just give the mp3s away, Amazon's prices are so affordable, that I usually just shoot links to friends and let them decide whether they want to buy it or not.  Even if the artists just gave their mp3s away for free, people like me will gladly buy the DVD/CD combo @ $13.99.  Aside from touring, that's how artists can make money in this screwed up, money only music biz.  Branford Marsalis from the film \\"Before the Music Dies\\" came up with that business model which I think is truly inspired.  Anyway, I couldn't wait, so I just downloaded the .mp3 album - an early father's day gift to myself, in lieu of new socks. *nod*hey would go out and buy their own copy ('cause you'd be hounding them to give it back!).

B002VECM6S|4.0|I really enjoyed this tale about \\"Big Mike\\" or Michael as he prefers to be called.  We see Michael being forced to enter a school that doesn't want him because the football coach thinks he can be a great offensive lineman.    The school reluctantly takes him and because of his size people seem to be afraid of him.     Michael seems to live on the street, finding shelter at the laundromat.  One evening Sandra Bullock sees him walking cold and asks him where he is going.  He says to the gym.  Sandra knows it is closed and soon deducts that Michael is living on the street.  She offers him her couch to sleep on for the night.    Bullock than offers Michael to stay with her family in his own room.  In one of the most poignant scenes of the film Michael says he never had one.  What Bullock thought he meant was his own room but he meant his own bed.    As the movie unfolds the family bonds with Michael and he starts to show slight improvement at school.  Bullock learns that Michael has a psychological strength for protecting.  This protective instinct comes in handy later in the film where Michael will act to protect Collins, Bullock's son and thus save his life.    Bullock also starts to learn life's lessons about the poor and stereotypes and really sees her own friends for who they are.    I enjoyed this film from start to finish and it is hard to believe that it was a true story because it is too perfect.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Why BBC/Discovery would produce another dubbed version of their amazing documentaries is beyond me.  After the abortion that was the \\"American version\\" of Planet Earth, I assumed such a thing would never be done again (what is so wrong with British English?).  Anyway, after excitedly picking this up at the store the other day after seeing it was on sale, I was horrified to notice that the packaging mentioned \\"narrated by Oprah Winfrey.\\"  After doing a bit of research, I discovered that, yet again, two versions of the documentary were produced.  I did not, however, panic, as I thought \\"I can just return it to the store and switch it for the Attenborough version.\\"  After looking through the store availability online and calling a few different stores, it became apparent that this large chain store DOES NOT carry the British version in its stores (just online).  It is insulting enough that Americans need a \\"special\\" version, but even more infuriating that it isn't even available in-store; thus leaving me stuck with an inferior piece of garbage that I cannot return or exchange or even sell as used because, frankly, anyone interested in documentaries would be sure to avoid this version like the plague.  It really makes me happy that I wasted $50 because of absolutely insulting TV/DVD company and retail store policies.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Last year, I read the book \\"Push\\" by Sapphire that this film is based on.  In addition to the horrific story of incest that is a destiny of the main character Clarice (Precious), power of the novel is based on the way that it is written.  I still do not understand how author did it, since the book gives the voice of the illiterate person not capable to fully express herself both verbally or in writing through her journals.<br /><br />I could not imagine that courage that it took to make this novel into a movie.  It is not just the topic of incest but also a wonder if director and screenwriter can portray book characters the way that they are developed in a book.  I must say that movie is easier to watch that the book was to read.  Actresses in this film all did fantastic job in portraying women from different backgrounds, both social and racial.  I also liked the music as well.  This is powerful film about the lives of girls and women in socially deprived areas, urban ones, where in today's modern world anger, disatisfaction and poverty lead to most horrific experiences of all.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|I have never been so relieved for an artist to come along. A lot of rappers nowadays have no substance within their music, a simple beat and even simpler lyrics. However, you can tell Cudi puts a lot of thought and effort into his music. I would give you guys a rating list, but the only one I wouldnt rate perfect would be \\"hyerr\\".  Its a pretty good song, probably 7.5 out of 10, but doesnt not hold a candle to any other cudi song I've ever heard. I'm so excited for what is to come from this lyrical genius.
B001FB5634|3.0|When this film first came out, everyone was calling it the next \\"cult\\" movie.  It was the curiosity of wishing to know what people mean by it that made me see this film.  Personally, I was disappointed and do not believe that this film will have a lasting, long term power over audience in spite of Viggo Mortenson's touching performance as a father doing everything possible to protect his son in post apocaliptic world that has lost all traces of its humanity.<br /><br />Like \\"Mad Max\\" and similar movies, after world goes into smitterines and there is no food, water, animals or plant life left, humanity goes out of the door as well.  People are at their worst behavior and need for survival takes them to make drastic measures.  Main characters are father and son searching to find a way to a better world.  While Mortenson convincigly portays father who protects his only son and reflects on the better times from his past, young actor playing his son seems too pretentious when he refers to his father as \\"Papa\\" thoughout the movie.<br /><br />I have not read the book, but I do have a feeling that certain messages about human connection, our inner feelings and need to connect are just not translated well into this movie.
B000AY74OG|1.0|I don't know what everyone else see's in this movie but I failed to see anything funny in it. First of all a lot of the humor is way over a little kids head. They wouldn't have the slightest idea what they were talking about. It's like they wanted to make it for the adults to laugh at and forget about the kids. Isn't this a kids movie??? Also it has an incredibly slow start. The first 30 min. of the movie are very boring to say the least, most kids would have already lost interst in this movie before it ever picks up speed. Right when you think things are going to get going with the music and dancing, it stops! Way to much dialoge for little kids and not enough action and music to carry the movie through. SOOOOOOOO disappointed.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|This is a fascinating movie.  Emily Blunt (Victoria) and Rupert Friend (Albert, with a charming accent) are perfect in their roles, and their on-screen chemistry is magical.  The character of Lord Melbourne might have been better cast with a more mature actor (as Melbourne was actually 40 years older than Victoria), but if you can get past that, Paul Bettany plays a fine Lord Melbourne.  Jim Broadbent is brilliant as King William, as is Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide.  Although the movie was about the early years of Victoria, it was so captivating that we just didn't want it to end.  Also, if you like the movie, be sure to purchase the original movie soundtrack available on CD.
B000P46QIG|3.0|I bought this CD after a friend played for me in his car. The musicianship is fantastic. I definitely don't envy the drummer trying to keep up -- or maybe it's the other musicians that need to keep their parts straight while the drummer plays all kind of compound rhythms and off-beats.     Unfortunately, this CD is a classic case of \\"volume war\\" gone overboard. When my friend played it for me, I thought the distortion was in his car speakers. WRONG! This CD is way over-squashed, full of wave form clipping and the resulting digital distortion. It might be tolerable if the music on this disc was a brain-dead as, say, Nirvana. But this is PROG. Prog requires a little more finnesse (sp?). Better to mix a little quieter than just ruin a would-be 5-star disc. I've found multiple prog bands doing this lately -- Redemption's \\"Snowfall On Judgment Day\\", for instance.     Until these bands take control of the out-of-control engineering, I don't care how good the music is -- you're only getting 3 stars out of me.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|I think `No Other' is one of those epiphany albums. I bought my copy about 6 months ago. I liked it, but wondered what all the fuss was about. I would come back to it every couple of weeks, it sounded good (but I still wasn't sure what all the fuss was about). Then I listened to it again just this week. This was the epiphany moment. Now I can't stop playing the damn thing! This an album that should be played very loud to be really appreciated. It demands attention from the listener, it can't be treated as background noise or a superficial soundtrack to a busy day like so much music often is. There is so much going on in each cut - apart from the fine Gene Clark vocals - that really draws the listener in and rewards the attention given. Now I know what all the fuss was about. I got there in the end and the journey was well worthwhile.
B000063JZQ|5.0|In his inimitable style, Polanski has turned a classic play into a great film, brilliantly creating an atmosphere, adding action, and rendering the characters vividly alive.<br /><br />All too often, Shakespeare comes off as staid and too high brow, like you have to read and then hear the play to really get it.  Of course, when you make the effort, it is as beautiful as opera, which requires a similar preparation to fully appreciate.  What Polanski accomplishes is simply astonishing:  without dumbing it down in the slightest, he makes a very complex play completely understandable in a single viewing.  It is one of the best such adaptations I have ever seen.<br /><br />What Polanski emphasizes is the horror of what Macbeth does, a witness to his corruption and psychological deterioration from the inside, making it into a psychological drama.  That is one layer that is there in the original play, but it is harder to feel - at least in my viewing experience - than when Polanski does it.  The work really becomes in part that of Polanski, while respecting the language and forms of the original.<br /><br />The backdrop, as shot in Wales I believe, is fabulously vivid.  You really feel as if you are there, from the gate guard urinating in the courtyard to the fires that heat the rooms.  Though the actors were not well known, they are perfectly cast, especially the phenomenal Francesca Annis and Jon Finch.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  Just be prepared to dream about it once you turn off your DVD player.  Note:  I got the British version of this new for $5, though without commentary.
0321344758|5.0|A great reference, compact and witty.<br />It tells you what to worry about when designing web content.<br />And it tells it well.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book.  On a weekly basics, I read 1-2 books and have hours of homework.  The bottom line is I read a lot of books and this is my favorite.  I liked this book because it really let me feel how M. was feeling.  I also like this because it has a lot of scientific terms and I love science.  By  Haley
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a very good but hard workout just on Level one still and she kicks my butt.  The only thing that I would change you have to go through the beginning where she is explaining everything each morning would like to save that time and skip that.  But I am sore all over.  A good kinda sore that you know it is doing you some good:)
B000VLOKQI|5.0|I was really impressed by this DVD (actually there are two: the other is called \\"Six Quick Ones\\")-- it gave so much insight into The Who and how their music evolved and how they felt about touring, their fans, drugs, rock and roll, the Cincinnati tragedy, their beginnings, each other-- it's really fascinating and, I think, the best comprehensive release to date. People have written that there should have been more music and less talk, but I disagree-- this is a documentary, not a concert DVD. We see Pete laugh-- sometimes in delight, sometimes self-deprecatingly-- Roger is forthright and honest about his feelings and emotions, as was Pete. There are truly emotional moments, as well, especially when they spoke about Keith and John. I also liked \\"The Kids are Alright,\\" but, IMO, this surpassed it. DEFINITELY for people who like REAL rock&roll-- not just for fans of The Who. I watched it again last night and every time I do, I see more facets, hear more details, and when it finishes give fervent thanks that the group called The Who happened into my life. What a gift!!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This was right up there with the gung-ho feel of Aliens with the Marines in space.  I think Colonel Rumsfeld Cheney stole every single scene he was in.  He was my hero.  I almost jumped out of my seat and cheered when he got strapped into his robot suit and jumped out of the exploding ship.  That was phenomenal.  Everything he said was cool to infinity and beyond.  When he ran outside to shoot as they were escaping from the base and he was holding his breadth and firing the gun?  Didn't you wish he'd nailed the ship and it fireballed down in blaze?  I know I did.  I sure wish he wouldn't have bit the dust at the end 'cause he definitly would have enhenced the sequal.  Avatar 2 needs somebody as bad-a#@ as Colonel Rumsfeld Cheney to come close to topping it.  I think the rest of the moview was about preserving some stuff and not messing with other races or something.  Colonel Rumsfeld Cheney ROCKS!
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|Absolutely bananas, listened to the album for a little bit, then decided to buy the DVD.  It was what I was anticipating, a very good video that I would highly recommend to anyone.

1935251740|1.0|Much of this book is based on a fundamental misconception of quantum mechanics. While it may be human observation that determines the results of a the double-slit experiment, it is far more self-consistent, parsimonious and intuitive that it is the presence of photons required for observation that determine those results. This follows from the interaction between the wave equations of the particles in question.    Furthermore, probability waves may affect events at the quantum scale, but their effect on things at the macroscopic scale is less than negligible. Once you stack on more and more particles with more and more interfering probability waves, the effects of quantum mechanics rapidly diminish.     The universe shows internal consistency in time and space, regardless of the extent of human knowledge (i.e., there was day and night before humans understood that the Earth rotated around its axis). It is simpler to have one external world than to have to posit six billion interacting worlds and have to finagle a longwinded explanation for why we all see consistent laws of nature.    And as far as space being a mathematical construct and not a physical entity; well, in Einstein's theory of general relativity (which is consistent with Newton's law of gravitation in all our of daily experiences and is also consistent with what we see when we look at a black hole), space time curvature is the only thing that determines the gravitational motion of objects.
1572700173|4.0|Sampling the first couple of dozen reviews, I fail to see any of what is being listed here by Amazon, that is, the Audio Partners audio book unabridged reading of Christies, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, by David Souchet, who has given us the most convincing Poirot in portraying the role for BBC and A&E television. Since many summaries and evaluations of the written book have appeared, I will make no comment on the story save to echo the view that this is good Christie but only the beginning of the character she ultimately delineated more appealingly. Souchet's reading is excellent, of course, with adequate voice characterizations of the variety of different speaking roles in the text. Hastings, the narrator for the book, naturally, is the most defined. Souchet creates an appropriately young (he is supposed to be in his early twenties at this time) voice, naive, overconfident, assertive, bewildered, easily bruised, angry, humiliated, awed, puzzled, as he deals with the Old Man who often seems to him to be more of an early senile dementia case than the brilliant detective he had been. He manages this central voice quite well, as he does the men and women who make up the suspects and walk-ons customary in the Christie cast. Surprisingly, perhaps only because I was not reading the book, is what I see as a somewhat too flighty Poirot, not as weighty as in the TV productions (where he retains the Belgian excitability). At any rate, I found the voice less appealing than in the filmed versions.   That is a minor point. Overall, there is a vivid portrait of the murder scene and the interactions comprising the plot to its denouement with the surprise solution offered to all the suspects gathered for that purpose in the murder house (but not Inspector Japp, who has strictly an \\"also with\\" role in the book.    At the price being charged as of this date, the audio book is a bargain for those addicted to them as am I.
B0035J6TA8|2.0|I probably should have read the reviews, but since it's Peter Gabriel, I probably would have bought it anyway. Maybe it's good to put yourself or the kids to sleep with the fringe benefit of getting to hear PG's voice at the same time. Otherwise, I don't see myself listening to this album much more that one or two more times.
B000FJGWBC|4.0|There is so much to like about this little gem of a movie. Many say this is a remake of The Deep, and there are many similarities. The hot leads Walker and Alba (oh, she looks so good in this movie) are reminiscent to Nolte and Bisset (oh, she looks so good in that movie). The diving, treasure, drugs, drug dealers and sharks are all in both stories as well. However, this is a much better movie! Here come the crazy The Deep fans after me. The Deep was a very choppy story with some good scenes and decent acting (Robert Shaw is always awesome). Into the Blue really draws you in with the main plot and all the subplots. The dynamics of love, friendship, betrayal are well written and connects you to the characters. The mystery behind the Zephyr and the plane filled with cocaine is also compelling. Can you believe I am saying this about a movie with Paul Walker in it??? The action sequences are great, especially with the sharks (and yes that is Paul Walker swimming around with all those reef sharks around him). Give credit where it is due, this is a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful transfer. The power of blu is evident in all the underwater sequences. On DVD the scenes look pixelated in areas of darkness. That is not the case with BD. The audio is also a nice mix. SPECIAL FEATURES: All ported over from DVD. FINAL THOUGHTS: Jessica Alba in a bikini in HD = UPGRADE!
0307346617|1.0|I'm giving this book one star for pure creativity. Max Brooks really has a great idea and has spent a lot of time thinking about every aspect of life on earth that would be affected by an all out zombie war.    But his WRITING IS TERRIBLE. I don't mind a book that has little to no character development - and this book  has none - but every one of the 50+ characters introduced has the exact same voice - arrogant, pissed off and full of testosterone.     And, really, how many times can ten different people call someone else a \\"puke\\"? Aren't there some other PG-13 insults you can think of for name calling? I think Brooks wore out his imagination scheming about zombies so completely, that he had none left for diction and basic book writing.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Ahhh, what a breath of fresh air to a very stale character. Robert Downey Jr. brings the legend to life. This is the detective no one has ever seen before. Jude Law is also wonderful as Holmes' trusted colleague, Dr. Watson. The story takes place in London, and centers around a supernatural plot led by Lord Blackwood. There is so much going on, that although some things are predictable it is still delivered to you in fine fashion. The negative reviews, which are few, all revolve around the way Sherlock is portrayed in this movie. They need to get over it, because this is the way Sherlock Holmes should be portrayed. Downey is witty and convincing as a brooding genius who can handle himself in a scrum. Well done! Looking forward to the sequel where he takes on Moriarty!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Stunning picture! A delight for HD enthusiasts. Also a real nice audio mix. SPECIAL FEATURES: Interesting and worth a look. FINAL THOUGHTS: A MUST OWN!
B001MEJY8W|3.0|I've seen some of the most extreme horror films in existence. It really takes a lot for me to wince, and possibly even skip a scene entirely if it looks like something very graphic is going to happen. But I winced and cringed etc. over almost the entire running time of this film, so relentless is it's brutality. The movie is like a hour and half long roller coaster ride through hell.     This is not to say that it's a bad film, because technically speaking it's superior from just about every angle. And while it is sometimes is the violence that startled me, it was more about the relentless tension and fear the film builds so well. It simply never lets up. The first half of the film sets the stage for a completely surprising plot twist that gudes the story to film's ultra-disturbing second half and ultimate conclusion.     Let me be clear: if people being endlessly cut, stabbed, bloody and maniacal isn't your thing, steer clear. If women being beaten and tortured isn't your thing, steer WAY clear. I gave it a three star review because of the quality of the product, but seriously, this is one the roughest, hardest to endure movies I've ever seen. And I've seen Cannibal Holocaust twice.
B002N5KVDG|5.0|Wow, I agree with anyone who says listening to this album made them feel like a teenager again. This is a throwback to the DK days for sure. Might as well call this Bedtime for Democracy part 2 while you're at it. There is one song that I am not all that thrilled with but it's a small complaint. Even 20+ years later Jello Biafra is still the man, any Jello/DK fans out there need to pick this up or d/l the mp3s. It's been a long time coming, now I just need The Guantanamo School of Medicine to tour the US and come to Florida.

0812973992|4.0|McCann doesn't tell the same story twice. Neither does he use a recognizable formula. What is recognizable to familiar readers is the brilliant prose he uses to pull you in. Like his earlier books, he really knows how to set the scene.  Here in near-bankrupt 1970s NYC, he writes on-point descriptions of everyone and everything, from the uniformed Park Avenue doorman to the decaying South Bronx with stops in the Village. He brings together characters in spite of - really because of - their differing misfortunes and sea-separated cultures. Thus, the opening chapters, narrated by one of the Brothers Corrigan, promises to be McCann's best work. Perhaps because I read this book as chapters rather than related short stories, for me, it didn't fulfill the promise. There are too many people, too many forced connections. By the end, it wound down and fell over.     The best developed parts are told by one of the Corrigans. Neither brother's first name is revealed until much later. The narrator calls the other by their last name. His reason is explained so simply, and defines the brother so well, that I re-read the line. Throughout the book, the dialogue is crisp and natural. With some exceptions, McCann doesn't encase the dialogue in quotation marks. His dashes, which separate the speakers, are especially effective in a multi-party conversation. Usually when a storyline is left unfinished, a reasonable conclusion is picked up later by another character. But, too often this doesn't happen: like with the computer hackers and the photographer, people drop out of sight never to be heard from again. Were these characters inserted just to show a broader expanse of the New York populace? I was especially disappointed in how stereotypes were worked.  This writer can script familiar stereotypes (read `Zoli') and smash them so hard that the reader is forced to examine his own prejudgement of the stranger. He failed to do that here, especially with Gloria, the opera-lover with a Syracuse U degree. She came off as a caricature, stuck in the projects and an out-sized, flowered dress.     So, why the four stars?  Every scene in which the Corrigans and Tillie appear pulsates with realism even though I don't know anyone like them. And, walking, dancing a tightrope between the Towers is an inventive allegorical element.
B000A6T262|5.0|Owning all of the original Star Trek films on VHS is great, but with the transition to newer, digital formats, this is a must-have for Star Trek fans. Watching Star Trek II on DVD is completely awesome. If you don't feel like purchasing every DVD individually, this is a great, neat looking set with each film (except for the 2009 Star Trek).
B00275EHJQ|5.0|If \\"Toy Story 3\\" does not have as much free-wheeling humor as the first two films, it more than makes up for it in the overall /darkness/ of the story. This is a tale of having to let go of something you dearly love, and Pixar pulls out all the emotional stops, without getting the least bit syrupy or sappy. Kids /will/ enjoy the film, but many adults will find themselves crying. This isn't to say there's no humor (Buzz's switch to Spanish-language mode is particularly amusing, and Ken takes a lot of poking), but \\"Toy Story 3\\" is fundamentally serious. I was worried that it would be a mediocre \\"tie up the franchise with a third film simply to make a buck\\", but it is a solid, involving, /genuinely moving/ film.<br /><br />I saw the 3D version, and the thrilling opening sequence shows just how effective 3D can be when properly used.<br /><br />Though a bit disappointing (the overall plot is too much like #2), it is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy.

B0025KVLUQ|2.0|\\"Abbey Road (Remastered) [Enhanced, Limited Edition, Original recording remastered]\\"    This is almost unrecognizable with the original in sound reproduction. I thought I was listening to a modern cover band.     If you could have only one Beatles album, the original Abbey Road would be THE one to have. How could you possibly \\"enhance\\" it?     It's like painting a Cubist version of a Rembrandt.
B0032SMR1W|1.0|I don't want to spoil the story so I won't go into details but I will say the movie is intriguing at the onset but as the movie progresses it gets less and less interesting and more and more out of touch with reality. It's a pathetic attempt at being clever and falls way short of what I expected. I wish I could get the the two hours of my life back..
0316044938|1.0|I found this book to be nothing less than anti climatic, cheesy and nothing short of boring. Yes,its absolutely horrible what happens to Susie but isn't all rape and murder? People read this book expecting to be taken away from the traditional hack and slash mystery serial killer novel and be air lifted into the heavens with  beautiful writing and tear-jerking drama. I found the dialogue of the 14 year old Salmon to be very odd, out of place, and just plain old weird platitudes that are spoken at a lighting frequency. Enough is enough!     I also found the whole premise of the mother leaving the family to be dumb and ill conceived, why would she leave her family in the first place if she truly cared about them, and second of all from a story teller's viewpoint, what did she do on her epic journey? The answer is NOTHING!!?!. It was a plot element that was simply undeveloped and had no suspense to it, she leaves and then she comes back. Maybe if she had stayed wherever she was it would've been a good plot element.     Now onto the afterlife..UGH! Can anything be more weird and 1970's drug trippy than Sebolds portrayal of the afterlife? I challenge any one of you to come up with a more weird and just plain old dumb perception of the afterlife. Seriously, I probably could have the same experience of reading this book if I had gotten high and watched To Catch a Predator for 6 hours straight!!! Man I can't wait to see what Sebold's interpretation of Hell is like!!! Must be a real hum-dinger!!!    All in all, I find it very hard to believe that no one in the history of kiddie murder story or any mudder story has never tapped into the POV of the victim, maybe they just went unnoticed and decided to read this crap instead and hop onto THE LOVELY BONES BANDWAGON!!! Please save yourself some time and read something that actually makes you think and feel involved in the story.Please a little girl living in the great candyland in the sky who's dying(literally) to get a better sex experience with her earthly crush is not my idea of good writing.

B000059Z8J|4.0|Heck, this 1978 version of SUPERMAN was nostalgic even when it originally was released.  Featuring the likes of Marlon Brando, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Glenn Ford, and Susannah York, the film instantly became a Who's Who of established screen heavyweights.  And you can never, ever, go wrong with Gene Hackman as the villain; his Lex Luther character could very well be the best known--and best loved--bad guy in cinematic history.<br /><br />Yet--despite its numerous cornball supreme moments that still have me grimacing--the best thing SUPERMAN has going for it is charm.  This is a gloriously charming film, from its visuals of rolling wheat fields in Kansas, to its (at the time) state-of-the-art special effects--to its ever-respectful homage to its TV series predecessor.  Christopher Reeve plays the Man of Steel with humility, grace, and yes, humanity (Krypton or no Krypton).  Reeve turned out to be a home run for director Richard Donner.  Alas, Margot Kidder is just plain annoying as an aggressive, overbearing, man-eating Lois Lane, but she's merely an irritant that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of this film.<br /><br />SUPERMAN is a light, fun, and entertaining movie--a lusciously glorious dose of good vibes nostalgia.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

B003ELOQD4|1.0|What is it with U2? I've seen them, I don't know, maybe 10 times since '87. Every show was completely amazing. I've always appreciated when they've reinvented their sound (well, maybe not on Pop) and am even a big fan of No Line ... (and it seems like I'm in the minority here). But, when I saw them in New York last year, I couldn't believe it was the same band. The sound was absolutely terrible and the performance was so lacking that, for the first time, I regretted spending tons of money to get great U2 tickets. I've never seen a band just go through the motions the way they did that night. I understand that they're getting older and all that (by the way, not an excuse - look at Metallica), but a band in their position owes it to the fans to maintain the standard they've been setting for the last 25+ years. Sadly, U2 didn't do that on the last tour and definitely not on this DVD - while the sound is ok, the rest of it comes off like a cheap cash grab.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|i really love this series being a nature lover. would recommend it as it contains lots of stuff about our planet that was never heard of or seen before.
0061205699|4.0|To kill a mocking bird is a revealation of the injustice that is still perceived in America. It is a book that will bore you from the beginning but will push you to the edge of your seat from chapter 14 to the very end. Its a book for both the old and the young. Its a text book that reveals social injustices and the negative consequences it puts on society as a whole. I wish there was only one storyline, where Harper could have focus on Scout and Atticus relationship than the other characters. The book could have been breif and more riverting, provocative and captivating. But overall, I recommend this book!
B00000ILGL|5.0|Just like Jean-Michel Jarre and Mike Oldfield who re-recorded their masterpieces (Oxygene and Tubular Bells respectively) remixing them and using nowadays' digital technology, Giorgio Moroder should do the same with his album `From here to eternity'. This is truly hypnotic stuff although the album has aged extremely very well (only some the vocals are slightly outdated) proving that Moroder was ahead of his time, I am convinced that a slightly updated longer version of it would be a great success. So Giorgio if you reading this please get to work, make us dream and dance again!
B000KN9G52|5.0|As the other DM 5.1 releases I own (Violator, MFTM, Exciter)this one is an excellent example of a 5.1 surround mix. The difference between the sacd and the DTS mix are subtle, very subtle. I am beginning to think most who praise the sacd and trash the DTS haven't even heard both recordings. They are both excellent and it does seem the sacd is a tad better. A very small amount. I think the difference might be, like the other sacd's, DVD-Audio's, and DTS recordings I own, is the person who mixes them. Maybe on a graph the sacd is better overall, but to the average listener like me the audible difference is very small. Bottom line is if you can only get ahold of the US versions that have the Dolby and DTS mixes, get them, you'll love it. Don't care for the Dolby, love the DTS. If your lucky enough to get the UK versions with the sacd and both Dolby and DTS mixes, get them. You won't go wrong with either one of them in my opinion and if you snub the DTS version because it's not the sacd, they all might be gone before you know it. This happens to be one of my favorite DM albums and now I can listen to it in a sweet surround mix makes it even better!
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|Life has a rational surface, below which is the infinite gloop. The Cure have made pop songs that are fun as can be (and others that irritate as much as any radio-friendly hit), but Robert Smith was in direct talks with the gloop for a time. The result was 1989's Disintegration.    Previous attempts at a masterpiece were merely attempts. Subsequent albums, so far at least, have been mostly studied. He's some artistic distance from Disintegration, but perhaps it's a lengthy ebb-and-flow thing rather than a more simple decline. Perhaps one day he'll turn up with a work of equal stature. All I know is, since that album his music is more likely to involve teenage-targeted angst and affected cat yelps. Attempts to be honest in his lyrics are likely to reveal a spoilt perfomer, where the words of Disintegration help reveal the submerged gloop.    An expanded reissue can cloud an album's virtues, and the 20 rough songs do little more than prove that Smith had much of the detail worked out at demo stage. Fewer of those, with the remixed singles from Mixed Up instead, would've better complemented the original 12 songs. The live rendition of the album has a beautiful open sound, though. It may cause drowsiness if you listen to it immediately after a full dose of the master version, otherwise it's more than lively enough. (You can find another, inferior, live take on the album on the Disintegration website, along with another 20 rough songs!) The remaster of the core songs brings benefits, too. It adds clarity, particularly to the depths of \\"Prayers For Rain\\", while managing to preserve the original mood. The \\"deluxe edition\\" is primarily, though, a reminder that Disintegration is Robert Smith's definitive statement.

0439023491|3.0|I was a little disappointed to be honest.  For one thing, you supposed to like the main character right?  Katniss became really annoying.  I felt like Collins went from being my favorite storyteller to incompetent at times.  Instead of trying something new, like I hoped she would, she basically tried the same old stunts from the first book.  Overall, it there as nothing new. I waited for her to switch things up a little, like having haymitch go in and peeta trying to keep katniss alive from the outside, but no, predictable situations.<br /><br />I am basically giving it four stars because the first one was so good. Yep, its like caryover points.  I hated the ending with the whole haymitch has been in on some resistance group. I hate those kind of re-writes of characters.  It is a garbage attempt to give haymitch some other identity that we know as readers was bogus and the writer invented suddenly at the end of the second book.  Gale comes off as annoying, peeta comes off as so weak, and katniss as the most annoying main character i have ever read.  Hopefully collins can rescue her failing storyline in the third book.
0374531269|1.0|I believe this book is a fraud. I picked it up shortly after seeing Mr. Beah's interview on The Daily Show. When I began reading I had no idea that there was any controversy about the book's accuracy. I started having problems with it when he wrote about the first time the boys see and hear the ocean. They are frightened at first by the noise of the waves, but then go and discover that they have just seen the ocean for the first time in their lives. So I go on Google Earth and look up the author's village, Mattru Jong. It sits on an island in the Atlantic Ocean. How could an island dweller be hearing the ocean for the first time at age 12? Then I got to the part where he first saw combat. He went to the swamp where they set up an ambush for the rebels. The fighting starts and several of his friends are immediately killed. He finally picks up his gun and, according to him, kills a man with the first shot. For those who aren't familiar with war, it is generally agreed that several thousand rounds are fired for every enemy killed. The notion that a scared 12-year old picked up an AK-47 and made a kill-shot on his first try is preposterous. He later writes about being shot in the foot 3 times with an AK-47. A human foot would be blown to absolute smithereens if shot 3 times with a round that size. He is making that up. So I went on-line to research this book and find that Mattru Jong was destroyed by rebels in 1995, not 1993 like the author claims.<br /><br />You are being intellectually dishonest if you equate my criticism of the author's lies with moral acceptance of the use of child soldiers. I have no doubt that the things described in the book have occurred to someone at some time, but just not to Mr. Beah at the times he claims. This book is a work of fiction, and should be regarded as such.
0439023483|5.0|First lets get out my complaints.  This is not generally my type of story, but someone recommended it to me, and I gave it a shot.  The dialog was not strong at times, and I even thought the writing was pretty weak. I mean, I understand that I am seeing the book from a 16 year olds point of view, but still, the sentence structure was really bad at times.    So why 5 stars?  This was one of the most engaging books I have ever read in my life, and I read a lot.  I have no idea of Collin's abilities in writing, but as a story teller, tremendous.  Read this book. The world she creates, this future type holocaust situation, is incredible. She set up the games so well with the culture she creates.  I dont want to give anything away, so thats it.  Read the book.  Incredible.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Honestly I don't know how to review this... It's one of those movies where you have to see it in order to feel it's true awesomeness. I mean, I've tried describing the greatness of this movie to my friends but they just wouldn't understand it's level until they watched it with me.    Buy this movie, its a great movie to watch and to add to your movie collection.    This is by far the best satire I've seen.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|When i first decided to buy the Sex and the City i was very excited when i found this complete series set. But when i saw all the review of people that have had problems with the DVD i hesitated. Finally i decided to go for it and i don't regret it.   Even though it was brand new some of the DVD came with minor scratches. That is due to the poor manufacture design. I mean whoever thought that the sleeves were a good idea is dead wrong. Even if they would have charged a little extra they should have made it clip on's, there was plenty of space for it. Also the plastic that it comes in is soft. When this set first came out it was a hard plastic which it looks better.   Thankfully i had no problems with the DVD at all. I was one of the lucky ones. The set is beautiful. I bought something called dskin. It protects the dvd, though it is a little expensive. I bought just what i needed online from Walmart. Since i don't plan to only watch this set ones with the sleeves the DVD can get scratched. If you get lucky and you have no problems with the DVD i recommend you buy a set of d_skin. If you decide to buy Good Luck.
0446563048|4.0|I had high hopes for this book as a big fan of Zappos and Tony. Unfortunately I was some what disappointed. Some of the business related stories are interesting and I appreciated his perspective on customer service, finding your core competency and creating core values. However, I wasn't impressed by the childish stories of going to raves and buying a loft (and giving it a dorky name) for all of your buddies to party in. Sure, if I was 21 it might sound 'cool' to sell a company for millions and then buy a party loft, but I'm not 21 anymore. I was also bummed that the last chunk of the book was simply the 10 core values of Zappos and some internal email text that explains them. Sure, some of it was interesting but hardly the makings of a best seller.<br /><br />Again, there is some great stuff in this book...just not the whole thing. Its a quick read so go for it, just keep your expectations low.
6300184064|4.0|Jonathan Pryce stars as Sam Lowry, a bureaucrat growing frustrated in a quasi-futuristic parallel world where paperwork has gotten out of control. You need a form to do nearly anything, and trying to do your job without a form makes you an enemy of the state in danger of capital punishment, like the superhero-esque air condition repairman, Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro). Having a normal life isn't easy in Sam Lowry's world, so when he falls in love with a suspected terrorist he has been having dreams about, things really get crazy for him, not to mention dangerous!<br /><br />With a star-studded cast and written and directed by Monty Python alumnus Terry Gilliam, 1985's \\"Brazil\\" comes off as a fascinating and much more fanciful take on Orwell's \\"1984\\", with bureaucracy itself taking the place of Big Brother. To answer a common question, the title of the film comes from the recurring tune, \\"Aquarela Do Brasil\\", so it's not due to the film taking place there. Having said that, the movie itself is a justified cult classic with it's fascinating world and characters, including a troubled but likeable everyman lead whom we are able to attach to for the entire ride. The only drawback is that even for the viewer, the world presented can get difficult to take after a while. Yes, you can get tired of watching all the paperwork and demands for paperwork. Perhaps the narrative could have been a bit tighter to avoid this frustration spilling over to the audience, but maybe then the point wouldn't have been made as strongly as Gilliam wanted. Regardless, a very good film if this is your cup of tea, with wonderful performances, a sharp and disturbing exaggeration of the world we live in, and that very catchy, dreamy old song.
0060899220|5.0|Naturally, this book is great for anyone interested in the food service industry.  Bourdain gives you the inside dish on the industry, and it's just as juicy and spicy as you could wish for.    But more than that, Kitchen Confidential is a pleasure to read.  Its prose is indulgently conversational and perfect amounts honest and confrontational, somehow toeing the line between humility and justifiable pomp.    Reading Bourdain's work is like sitting down with him at the bar, quaffing something malty and refreshing, and listening as he takes you inside the gritty scenes of the industry, the loading docks and the blazing hot kitchens.  Once you sit down, you won't want to leave.

B0009UC7H0|4.0|Sahara is a movie about finding a treasure ship in the middle of the Sahara desert. Once you get over that implausible sounding premise, you have a fine and very fun movie.<br /><br />The stars are personable and humorous in their roles, the action is exciting, and you lose yourself in the story very quickly. Of course, the book is another chip off the ol' Indiana Jones block, and therefore most of what you see is pretty derivative. Considering that the majority of movies are derivative though, what is important is if you enjoy it. If you like most McConaughey movies, you'll like this one. If you don't particularly like the average McConaughey vehicle, give this a pass.<br /><br />The DVD presentation is solid. Both picture and sound are good.
0307592839|5.0|\\"Time is a goon,\\" says Bosco, an aging rock star now terminally ill, who tells his publicist he wants to tour one more time. When she protests, pointing out he may not be up to touring, he tells her that's the point. He wants it to be a suicide tour. \\"I want to flame away,\\" he says. \\"I want my death to be an attraction, a spectacle, a mystery. A work of art.\\"<br /><br />This is just one small part of \\"The Goon Squad,\\" Jennifer Egan's nudge nudge wink winky, but entirely remarkable work. It's not exactly a novel, and it's not exactly a short-story collection. Call it a series of episodes in the lives, at various times, of the rotating cast of characters who cycle through it, trying to get from A to B, as time and chance happens to them all. The episodes are not in chronological order. For example, a writer who has been jailed for assaulting a movie starlet is seen first after he emerges from jail. There we meet his sister--the publicist who's got Bosco for a client. She works for a woman named La Doll, who appears in the next tale a few years later, impoverished after a surrealistic mishap at a New Year's Eve party, who is now offering as a companion, yes, that starlet to a military dictator as part of her attempts to humanize him. Then we encounter (in a truly cringeworthy sequence) the article the brother who assaulted the starlet was trying to write when he went off. Having failed in his assault on her body, he continues to do so with his words--words that prove him to be a pseudo-intellectual twit.<br /><br />If there's one protagonist it is, I suppose, Sasha, who we meet in the first tale (and it's one of the best opening scenes you're likely to ever encounter), and who ends up with the largest page tally. An assistant at a record company, when first encountered she is telling her therapist, to whom she's gone for treatment of her kleptomania, how she lifted a wallet out of an unattended handbag in the women's room of a restaurant. The incident itself is interwoven with the scene at the therapist's.<br /><br />In the next tale, we encounter Sasha with her boss, Bennie, several years earlier, as he pays a visit to one of his former acts--two sisters who want to stage a comeback. In the next, we meet Bennie in late adolescence, along with other members of his crowd at the time. One of the characters there, Lou, is next seen with his lover, his daughter, and her younger brother as they go on an African safari. This is perhaps the most conventionally written sequence, but I doubt you'll see the last lines coming.<br /><br />Ms. Egan uses every trick in the book: first- and third-person narration, present and past tense, and one tale, in which we meet a younger Sasha, is told in the second person (an almost impossible trick to bring off but one that the author finesses with ease). Ms. Egan turns in a noir version of \\"searching for the American abroad,\\" as Sasha's uncle goes in search of her. And then there's an episode told as a powerpoint presentation. The concluding tale, set 10 or 15 years from now, dabbles in \\"if this goes on\\" sci-fi. It's a celebratory tale, as we seem to be rebounding from war and ecological disasters. Sasha does not put in an appearance here, but she dominates the tale nevertheless. It's tongue in cheek (Ms. Egan imagines we have managed to alter the earth's orbit, so the days will be shorter in the winter--apparently nobody cares that this will, of course, make them longer in summer), but strangely moving all the same.ne at the therapist's.

044656740X|5.0|John T. Reed is a sensationalist author that claims all successful Real Estate authors are LIARS. Except, of course, him and a few others, conveniently less successful, less known authors that more commonly write technical books than those for lay readers. Not surprisingly, his web site criticizing several prominent authors is his greatest advertisement.<br /><br />Anyway, Kiyosaki's public response to Reeed's rather popular report is essentially a response to all the ad nausem criticism that has come out against Kiyosaki. More usually than not criticism of \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" comes as a result of failure of the criticizer to acknowledge their own faults and approach to money than it is Kiyosaki's fault for giving bad advice. Really people... if you didn't want \\"what rich people tell their kids\\", then why did you buy the book? The purpose of the book is a whole new approach to viewing money, not as a step-to-step guide for building wealth! If someone was to write that book, it would be one page and say \\"Write this book.\\" There's no universally applicable, easy way of becoming rich(unless you're planning on winning the lotto or on becoming a famous athlete)! Instead, it is the overarching approach to money and finance that can lead you to succeed in whatever endeavor it is you set out to do... THAT is what Kiyosaki does(or, more sets you on your path to doing) with his book!<br /><br />Kiyosaki's response to critics: \\"I normally do not reply to comments about me or my books and products. But many friends called me with concern about John T. Reed's comments on his personal web site, so I decided to glance over his in depth report on my book.<br /><br />First of all, I support our right to the freedom of speech. When I read comments on my company's bulletin board, I weigh both compliments and criticisms equally and welcome both. I make no comments simply because both compliments and criticism are important and I do not want to encourage or discourage either. I reply to John T. Reed's report simply because it is much more than a criticism. I find it more of an angry attack and I wonder why. I wonder why someone so smart and so rich would spend so much time writing a lengthy heated report on my simple little book.<br /><br />So rather than say nothing I thought it best to offer you my view on his report and let you come to your own conclusions.<br /><br />The following are my points to you, not him, on some of the points he raised:<br /><br />1. First of all, \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a very simple book. It was not meant to be a textbook for the Harvard Business School.<br /><br />2. Second of all, RDPD was meant to take a very complex subject and make it simple. It seems he took what was simple and made it complex.<br /><br />3. \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" is a true story of a man who did not graduate from high school, yet ultimately became one of the richest men in Hawaii.<br /><br />4. As my rich dad said, \\"In school, your measure of success is your report card. In the real world, your report card is your financial statement.\\" My rich dad did not have a good report card but he had a good financial statement.<br /><br />5. \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a story of a simple man teaching two 9 year old boys his 6 basic lessons about money. As I said earlier, this book was not meant for students of the Harvard Business School. If \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" raised the hair on John T. Reed's back, my next book, \\"Rich Dad's Guide to Investing\\", which is now due out on May 1, 2000, will cause him to write an even longer report. I can't wait to read his next document.<br /><br />6. And finally, his accusations about my college education are worthy of comment. I considered going to the school he went to, which was West Point. It is the federal military academy that trains officers for the U.S. Army. I did not apply for a congressional appointment to his school, although it is a fine school. I chose my school, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NewYork for two reasons. And they are:<br /><br />  * I wanted to learn about international trade. Kings Point trains officers to sail ships such as tankers, cargo ships, and passenger liners to carry on commerce throughout the world. At Kings Point I studied subjects I love such as Naval Architecture, International Trade, Sailing, Navigation, Admiralty Law, International Law, Business Law, as well as the regular hard sciences. I also spent a year abroad, sailing on passenger ships like the Love Boat and sailing to places such as Hong Kong, Thailand, Alaska, and Tahiti. I was being paid to go to school while I sailed the world. It was a great way to get a college education.<br /><br />  * Kings Pointers were at that time, some of the highest paid graduates in the world. In 1964, when I had to choose between Kings Point and West Point, a West Point graduate was making about $200 a month. A Kings Point graduate was starting out at over $2,000 a month and higher. So although Kings Point is not as prestigious a school as West Point, a 1000% ROI difference per month for the same 4 year education seemed like a smart financial decision to me.<br /><br />The reason King Pointers were paid more upon graduation than West Pointers was because Kings Pointers graduated as civilians and West Pointers graduated as military officers. Kings Pointers were paid by private shipping companies while West Pointers were paid by the federal government. That is why, when I graduated and went to work for Standard Oil of California, my pay was $42,000 a year, in 1969. West Pointers were making a little less than $5,000 a year. My classmates who sailed civilian cargo ships in Vietnam were paid double combat pay, although, they were not in much danger, which meant that many were paid $80,000 to $120,000 a year upon graduation. Not too bad for a 22 year old kid in 1969.<br /><br />Although I was draft exempt and did not have to go to Vietnam because I was a Merchant Marine Officer, I chose to resign from my high paying job and join the U.S. Marine Corps. I went to flight school and then on to fight in Vietnam. Both of my dads thought it was the duty of a young man to defend his country in time of war and that is what I did in 1969. So I only had that high paying job for only a short period of time.<br /><br />And that is my reply to John T. Reed's report. It is written to you, not to him. I suspect he would only get angrier if I tried to reason with him.<br /><br />I replied because what he said seemed much more than a criticism of my Book, it seemed like a personal attack. He has some valid points and I am sure he is a very smart man.<br /><br />In fact, he acknowledges that the Thunderbird School of International Management of Arizona is one of the top schools in international business. Should we tell him that Thunderbird uses \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" as part of its curriculum in its entrepreneur program, and that I have been invited to speak to its students on several occasions? Please refer to the testimonial from Thunderbird on our website.<br /><br />Yet, my book \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" while technically accurate, was not meant to be a technical book. It is a simple book about an often complicated and technical subject. \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" was written primarily to offer hope to people who wanted to find their own path to financial freedom rather than to be a slave to money all their lives.<br /><br />It was written to let people know that regardless if you did well in school or not, regardless if you had a high paying job or not, that each and everyone of us has the ability to reach the land of financial freedom if we have the proper financial education.<br /><br />As a final note, there is a new book out that I highly recommend, written by Thomas J. Stanley the author of \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\". In his new book, 'The Millionaire Mind\\", Stanley surveyed over a thousand millionaires and found that most were B and C students and had an average SAT score of1190. In fact, most of the millionaires would not have qualified for admission to most of the top academic institutions. Quoting from the book, \\"I find no correlation between SAT scores, grade-point averages and economic achievement. None.' says Stanley.<br /><br />And I say, 'Keep learning, keep an open mind, and thank you for taking an interest in your own financial education.'\\"nam. Both of my dads thought it was the duty of a young man to defend his country in time of war and that is what I did in 1969. So I only had that high paying job for only a short period of time.    And that is my reply to John T. Reed's report. It is written to you, not to him. I suspect he would only get angrier if I tried to reason with him.

As a final note, there is a new book out that I highly recommend, written by Thomas J. Stanley the author of \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\". In his new book, 'The Millionaire Mind\\", Stanley surveyed over a thousand millionaires and found that most were B and C students and had an average SAT score of 1190. In fact, most of the millionaires would not have qualified for admission to most of the top academic institutions. Quoting from the book, \\"I find no correlation between SAT scores, grade-point averages and economic achievement. None.' says Stanley.    And I say, 'Keep learning, keep an open mind, and thank you for taking an interest in your own financial education.'\\"
B002ZG997M|4.0|A lone hero must fight his way across the wasteland of post-apocalyptic America to protect a sacred book that holds the key to saving the future of humanity. A well-made post-apocalyptic action drama. This movie has some interesting ideas about a culture and how societies might rebuild themselves. Very watchable movie.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|\\"Mojo\\" is a great record. It's Tom Petty how bad could it be?<br />Mojo offers 15 tunes that run the gamut from riff based jump blues (\\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\") to a quasi-Steve Miller Band sound (\\"Candy\\") to country-inflected pop (\\"No Reason to Cry,\\" which offers perhaps the best Dylanesque vocal yet from Petty) to harder rocking tunes built around unison riffs (\\"I Should Have Known It\\"). Petty and his longtime compatriots Mike Campbell on guitars, Benmont Tench on keys, Ron Blair on bass, Scott Thurston on rhythm guitar and Steve Ferrone on drums, decided to record Mojo with none of the ProTools bells and whistles that have become de rigeur in modern recordings. The band simply showed up, not even having cut any demos, stood in a circle facing each other, and started playing as the tape--well, probably the hard drive--started \\"rolling.\\" The results are a somewhat looser, less produced sound than some of Petty's earlier outings, but there's also a spark of spontaneity that can only be caught by musicians not knowing exactly what's going to happen next.<br /><br />I found it to be musically all over the place. Delta blues, British Invasion, American Pop. It's not the kind of record where you just listen and it flows smoothly. It's a record that translates in to an anxiety attack.<br /><br />With that in mind, You'll be prepared. The second listen worked out much better.

B003LYJUXU|4.0|Music: 4 stars; Compilation: 3.5 stars; Economic value: 5 stars; Relevance: 3 stars<br /><br />Oasis imploded last year after the umpteenth internal fighting and disbanded. Frankly, after a run of 15 years, it was time. The band by then had run out of musical ideas for a number of years, even if their live performances continued at times to fascinate. In 2006, when the label told the band it would issue a 'greatest hits' compilation whether the band liked it or not, Noel Gallagher stepped up and took matters in his own hands, resulting in the curious mess that was \\"Stop the Clocks\\", a compilation that left many people scratching their heads. Now comes this.<br /><br />\\"Time Flies 1994-2009\\" (2CDs; 27 tracks; 136 min.) collects all of the band's 26 UK singles, plus \\"Champaigne Supernova\\", which was a US-only single. Let's state up front that is is not, and is not intended to be, a 'best of Oasis'. Indeed if that were the case, a lot more music of the band's essential 1994-1996 era (covering the first 2 albums and the numerous essential B sides from these albums' singles) would be included. So instead, you get all of the singles, nothing more, nothing less. That means a lot of music from the post-1997 era, when the band's musical genius started dropping off. There were still some great moments in the last 10 years or so (\\"Hindu Times\\" for example), but alas a lot of mediocre singles as well. Very annoyingly, this compilation is not chronological and the sequencing makes little or no sense (\\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" followed by \\"Song Bird\\"? \\"Champaigne Supernova\\" starting off CD2 instead of finishing CD1? etc. etc.). But at least you get 2 CDs worth of music here (unlike on \\"Stop the Clocks\\"). But no new tracks whatsoever.<br /><br />For anyone truly wanting the best of Oasis, just buy the first 2 album and the odds-and-ends compilation of the early years \\"The Masterplan\\". I suppose that this compilation is aimed strictly at the casual fan of Oasis, if there is such a thing, and at that, this is not bad and it's certainly selling at a very fan-friendly price. Much more interesting is the \\"deluxe edition\\" of \\"Time Flies\\", which comes with an extra CD and DVD. The extra CD brings the band's last concert in its entirety (London, July 21, 2009, a pretty good show at that), and the extra DVD finally compiles, for the first time ever, all of the band's music videos (with commentary). I've seen Oasis multiple times over the years, my first time in 1996 on the \\"Morning Story\\" tour here in the US, and what a musical force they were back then. I'll be interested to see if either Liam or Noel will have anything relevant to bring in their upcoming music efforts.hing, and at that, this is not bad and it's certainly selling at a very fan-friendly price.

B000NA2776|5.0|Oh Mika... I first heard the song Grace Kelly and had to hear more!  So I bought this cd and was pleasantly surprised.  I actually like it way more than I originally thought I would.  I love every single song, except for maybe Big Girl You Are Beautiful.  This guy is so silly & fun!  Mika's also really versatile and has a fabulous falsetto voice.  He's an awesome songwriter and you should definitely check this out!
034544678X|5.0|Great book especially for the price.  Has some interesting strories and is an eye opener, at least for me.  The author has a way of looking at thinks from a different point and delivers it well.
B002N8A14M|5.0|My daughter uses the clip, not the armband, so it's nice that it's detachable.  When running or working out, she clips it on upside down (works better with her clothing, I guess) and it holds her iPod securely even though the open end is facing down.  She's very happy with it and she's pretty picky.  Her earphones work fine with it, but they have a straight connector.  She hasn't had a problem with sweat damaging her iPod as she had with previous cases she's used.

B00005R24K|5.0|This movie to me seems like a comedy and I can see why my hubby has asked me to order this movie for him cause it so funny. Even though it suppose to be a horror movie but its not even scary. But I have enjoyed all of the Evil Dead movies.
B002UNMWAG|3.0|The acting is great. The plot is better than the original. The theme the same: taking the law into your own hands, playing God, and meating out justice - however deserved - your way. The violence alone is a benediction on the idea of too many people with too many guns. If this whole theme were'nt so real and palitable then this film would not be so much a fantasy then as a documentary.
0780626966|5.0|I brought this for hubby. But I enjoy watching them too. It so weird how he gets his victums and how he kills them in their dreams but they die in real life, which is kinda crazy. But all in all the movies of Freddy are real good.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|This is a real show off for blu-ray technology. The colors are rich and vibrant and non-stop. Totally engrossing and the theme and the acting is a joy. The whole family can watch this one. At least MY whole family.
B000AYEL1A|1.0|I'm a big Barbra Streisand fan but this movie remains such a bad movie remake of the original two.  It was a disappointment in 1976 and remains one today.  The writing is truely awful.  A movie to avoid--rent the 1954 version instead.  That version remains one of the best movie musicals of all times.
B00004R7TP|5.0|Only one of the greatest, most under-rated albums and artists of all time. 'Hounds of Love' is dreamy, haunting, and comforting wrapped up in a not-enough-stars-on-amazon-play-list that can be listened to from beginning to end. There is no need for a skip button. I heard this album echoing through the rooms of my childhood home. As an adult, I had to reunite with such a nostalgic piece of art.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Beautiful and clear remastering (2007) of the classic 1976 and 1980 compilations that in the USA were released in the late 80's on CD and have never been remastered (until now on this import!).  All the original tracks are here (with one change - Someone To Lay Down Beside Me is the 3:58 single edit, not the 4:28 album version that appeared on the original GH Vol 2). All the pictures from the two original Greatest Hits LP's and CD's are here, too (the original red and blue album covers are also shown on the back cover). The new green cover with a classic photo from the mid 70's is a brilliant touch. New liner notes by Silvie Simmons.<br /><br />Amazingly, some of these classics were not included on either Ronstadt's \\"Box Set\\" OR her \\"Very Best Of\\" CD (which together were the only remasters of Linda's Asylum music in the last 20 years - and both were missing many hits), so Silver Threads And Golden Needles (1973 version), Desperado, Love Has No Pride, How Do I Make You, Tumbling Dice, and Someone To Lay Down Beside Me appear here remastered for the first time. Highly Recommended!
0547260695|5.0|This is a very beautiful book.  The pop-up constructions are not as interactive as some pop-up books, but nonetheless rise from the page dramatically and bring this wonderful story to life.<br /><br />The Little Prince is my favorite book in the world, and this version was perfect for introducing it to my 9 year old son.<br /><br />The translation is more modern and not as emotionally impacting as the untouchable Katerine Wood version - 'What is essential is invisible to the eye' - but that can be for later, when a child is better attuned to more poetic language styles.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Ok i will admit the first 1/2 hour is wire wind ..  but after that it becomes clear this is a amazing movie .. the visuals are amazing and the story is heart warming and heart breaking at the same time .. it is why we watch movies .. it is worth watching 3 or 4 times
0061122416|3.0|This book was fine. Not bad, but not a have-me-glued-to-it-page-turner. I get what's behind the story, but it felt over-hyped since it was on so many \\"must read\\" lists. It's still good, but it felt on the simplistic side. And it ignores the idea that the best things can happen to you in life when your in-between Personal Legends, that you can have multiple ones, and that sometimes you don't even know what yours is until it lands in your lap all wrapped up in a bow.   Maybe it's just where I am in my own life now. I'm the happiest I have ever been and I guess it reminded me too much of the (simple) inspirational books I enjoyed in my younger days. I need something with a little more meat on it now.  I probably would have really loved it in my teens or early twenties. Now inspiration is found in those around me and not in parable that would excite a 12 year old. Life tends not to happen like \\"you can only have 1 dream, follow it and you will get everything you every wanted.\\" I guess that's what bothers me the most about it - seems like an immature ideology.   Still, it's not a bad book, it just wasn't a great book like I expected.
B001I5M9SC|4.0|I loved this concert especially becasue it was of the Vivere album.  The sound was mastered beautifully and the setting in Tuscany was a visual delight.  Well worth the money if you are a Bocelli fan.  There were several scenes though where the camera folks had problems focusing on the subjects. Several blurred scenes which will be obvious in a high definition product.  I was very surprised since I had read a review stating how good the picture was in the video.  It's still a fantastic product and I'd recommend buying it!
0823016714|2.0|I'm an illustrator and was searching for something to use as a launch for getting facial expressions. I need subtle, human emotions, but what I got in this book was a lot of outrageous expressions. If you're doing caricature, this book would be a great resource. If you need slight lifts of the brown, a downturn of the mouth, then take your own pictures. Also, I had hoped that the photos would have been arranged by emotion, rather than by model. This forces the reader to have to look at page after page of pictures in hope of finding the right expression. It's off to a book reseller I go...
B002ZCY7SW|3.0|24 has been far and away my favorite television show since it's inception. I've stuck with it during it's highs (Season 5) and \\"lows\\" (Season 6). To me, the first 7 seasons of the show were without question the best television ever. No matter how many times CTU was attacked or how many moles were revealed in the government I never thought it was anything less than brilliant. Which is why Season 8 bugs me even more than I thought a bad season of 24 could.    *SPOILERS AHEAD*    Gripe #1: The Jack-Renee romance.     Usually in 24 I've been able to separate whether I thought a story was good from my emotional reactions to it. Case in point, I didn't and still don't like what they did to Tony in Season 7 but I thought it made perfect sense to do it and so I thought it was great. And in Season 5 when several main characters were killed off, it bugged me but I felt those losses only added to the plot. No such luck with that reaction here.    This story did absolutely nothing for me. Seeing as we as an audience only knew Renee since the start of Season 7, so I didn't spend 3-4 seasons yearning for the 2 of them to hook up. And the way the writers handled it was beyond over the top. The way things played out, I'm supposed to believe that the 2 of them met each other at the start of Season 7, worked with one another for that 1 day, had nothing romantic occur between them, not see each other for 6 months-1 year, meet up again with Jack seemingly (and perhaps obsessively) in love with her (even though she has gone bonkers), commit to some sort of relationship very quickly, wind up in bed 8 hours later and have Jack throw his entire life away after she was killed. Up until they slept with each other I was okay with the quality of the story even though I thought it was moving a little too fast. But that happened and I thought it was WWWAAAAAAAYYY too \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" for 24. And to top it off, she dies 20 minutes later and Jack goes insane to avenge her, becoming extremely unlikable while doing so. The fact that Jack (who lost his wife and mother of his child and came out the other side about as well as somebody could in that situation) killed, tortured, threatened, assaulted and screwed over so many people in the name of someone he knew for not even 2 days was beyond absurd. And also it wasn't as though it was taking an emotional toll on him either, he did all of that without hesitation and seemingly no regret.     Nothing they did in their \\"romance\\" was believable, imo. All of it just seemed like a cheap attempt to A) pander to the audience by hooking Jack up with \\"Female Jack\\" (as I'd seen Renee glowingly called several times) or B) exaggerate the story as much as possible to make the final season bigger than they possibly could have had they taken things slowly. I personally believe it to be the latter, if anything.    Gripe #2: The complete refusal to acknowledge anything that happened in prior seasons (This rant won't be quite as long the previous one, luckily).    I can sum up this gripe with one question, where was Tony??? Seriously, they revived a beloved character at the start of last year, made him go completely off the deep end while seeking personal revenge but while doing so, revealing a much larger threat that had the writers chosen to follow through with, could have been a very epic way to wrap up the series. But they didn't. Instead Tony is in jail or perhaps dead and the culprits behind the actions in Season 7 just vanished without a word. Just like Season 2 into 3 except worse, at least there we were given a shoddy one line explanation as to what happened to those people.     And a side note to this gripe, where were some of the other characters from past seasons? Morris O'Brian? I know he wasn't very well liked in Season 6, but that's another story. Aaron Pierce? The only character other than Jack to appear in each of the first 7 years? And Kim Bauer? The story that made up the first few episodes between her, her daughter and Jack seemed very natural and sweet, but they dumped it completely in favor of Jack-Renee. Ew.    Gripe #3: The Russians? Seriously?    After Hassan was killed I was convinced that that was when they would call back the Season 7 conspiracy, but no. The Russian government was behind everything for some very vague reasons. And Suvarov was behind it all. That did not vibe with his character in the past, it just seemed like another cheap attempt to make things epic. Which also ties into another complaint (Another complaint? Yay! ;)). There was no big bad this year until Suvarov. No Henderson or Salazar or Jonas Hodges. Just Suvarov for 2-3 episodes.    Quick gripes: They ruined Logan for me. He became a cartoon only interested in repairing his reputation, rather than genuinely trying to help like Season 6 (another example of gripe #2. Or was it #3?).     The Dana Walsh story was too goofy. It did actually lead somewhere but it took too long to get there.      Now to the good, despite how little I will focus on it, there was a lot of. The peace agreement was one of the better stories they have come up with, imo. It was interesting all the way through and both Hassan and his wife were terrific. As was the deception within his government. Taylor was great as she was in Season 7, and although she went along with Logan too easily toward the end, I found that much more believable than what Jack was doing. Chloe was great as usual, it's been great how she's been the same annoying girl for years but never wore out her welcome, imo. Also, I thought the middle episodes were absolutely outstanding, although since I thought they were going someplace else they may not appeal to me as much now.    Well, that's it (finally!). As much as I didn't like this year I didn't find anything disgraceful in it. It just wasn't as good as other seasons in my opinion. I hope other people enjoy it as much as the other years and I'm still looking forward to a 24 movie. Thanks 24 cast and crew,for many great years of entertainment!

0307454541|4.0|I love shopping at Swedish-based IKEA. Every item is tightly packaged and when you get it home all of the parts easily come together to form a useful and attractive piece of furniture. This book, by Swedish author Stieg Larsson, employs the same approach to literature as IKEA does to home furnishings. It is the story of a newspaper publisher who is employed by a wealthy industrialist to uncover a decades-old mystery. There are many characters in this book, most of them minor, but each an integral part to completing the whole story. The major characters are far more complex and each is complimentary to the others. In other words, like an IKEA bookshelf, the characters and plot fit perfectly together to form an intriguing story of murder, corruption, and detective work, mixed in with a little romance. And when fully assembled, it makes for a great read with a satisfying resolution to the plot lines.
B001TK80C0|5.0|James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), the high velocity sequel to the original Terminator (1984), set an extremely high standard for the Terminator franchise.  Even so, Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003), directed by Jonathan Mastow (U-571, Breakdown), is very worthy addition to this science fiction saga.  The hard hitting sequel, concentrates on spectacular straight ahead action, while advancing the Terminator story to the infamous `judgment day'.<br /><br />Terminator 3 incorporates many of same basic elements from the previous films, particularly T2.  In his last action role before becoming the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns again as a different model of the Terminator, once again sent back into the past, tasked with protecting John Connor (Nick Stahl).  A killer T-X Terminator, played by the striking Kristanna Loken, is sent back in time, with a list of humans to be terminated.  As in T2, the T-X is an upgraded version of terminator, constructed of liquid metal, that can change its physical form to mimic anyone it comes in contact with.  In addition, the T-X can control other machines.<br /><br />Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who is John Connor's future wife, is also on the T-X's hit list.  Circumstances bring all the major players together, at Brewster's veterinary clinic, where the Terminator and the T-X have their first encounter, starting a thrilling and relentless chase, that lasts for the remainder of the film.  Special effects are a major component, and with people like Stan Winston involved, they are generally spectacular, and executed at an extremely high level.<br /><br />The story may be a familiar one, but the effectiveness of the tale is enhanced by some strong performances.  Some might argue that playing the Terminator may not require great acting skills, but few can match Arnold Schwarzenegger's huge screen presence, in this physically demanding role.  Borrowing from Robert Patrick's performance in T2, the striking Kristanna Loken plays a heartless killing machine with a feminine form.  She also has very few lines, as like Schwarzenegger, her role depends heavily on her athletic skills and physical presence.  It is quite an impressive performance, as clad in a dark red leather suit, and looking like a young Anne Francis, Loken is quite convincing as Arnold's physical equal.<br /><br />Last minute hire Claire Danes, handles her role well, as a character that goes through major transformations, and suffers the loss of loved ones.  Now in his 20's, John Connor is far from a world saving hero.  Nick Stahl is an interesting choice for this intriguing character, who does not seem very capable of fulfilling his destiny.<br /><br />Working largely from a very successful template, and featuring outstanding special effects, director Jonathan Mostow does a very competent job of executing a script that features a nice blend of familiar story elements, and some new twists.  Things are a bit rushed at the end, and the conclusion is somewhat anticlimactic, and uncertain, with the future in the hands of a somewhat shaky John Connor.  An exciting and violently fun adventure, Terminator 3 is a solid addition to any action film fan's collection.a Loken plays a heartless killing machine with a feminine form.

B000002AP1|4.0|The Stooges swan song album and also the allusion to the punk sound that sprang up in the mid to late 1970s together in one album. Iggy's remixing of the tracks does make the album sound stronger and more visceral. Classic proto-punk must have!
030726999X|4.0|This is an excellent conclusion to Larsson's Millennium Trilogy. The series protagonists, Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist take on a cast of especially nefarious characters in an effort to set right a host of injustices that have been visited upon Lisbeth from the time she was a very young girl.<br /><br />As with the other two books in the series, this one would have benefitted from a little more rigorous editing. In particular, there is a subplot involving Mikael's long-time lover, Erika Berger, that is somewhat distracting. Still, like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire, this is a real page-turner. Get a lot of sleep before you start the book; almost certainly you won't get much until you finish it.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|I'm not sure whether my ears have gotten older along with the rest of me or maybe James' and Carole's voices are not as powerful as they once were, but the sound seemed off to me. Or maybe the sound was processed in such a way it seemed to take away something from the music. All of the music sounded flat to me.<br />It was interesting and intimate to see these two old friends play and sing together, so that made the purchase worthwhile to me. But again, the sound just seemed off somehow.<br />Take a look at some of the other reviews before you decide from this particular review. Your preferences (and hearing) may be different than mine and you might really enjoy this cd/dvd combo.  I could be wrong. Or I could be right. The only way you'll know for sure is if you listen to the cd.

0316017922|4.0|This book reminded me quite a bit of [[ASIN:0060731338 Freakonomics]], but with an actual thesis.  Gladwell takes a statistical approach to discover what he calls the \\"real\\" story of individuals' success.  For example: we learn that Canadian Junior League hockey players are more likely to reach all-star status if they were born in the month of January.  Later, we find that programming genius, Bill Gates, was presented opportunities at a young age that 99% of all aspiring programmers would never possibly see. Gladwell's thesis does not seek to discredit the talented, industrious and highly motivated outliers of modern history.  On the other hand, it does seek to elucidate the foundational features of success by uncovering many pre-requisites to greatness.  If anything, I would suggest that future parents and aspiring young adults read and take a few lessons from this book. At the end of the day, its our preparation, our environment, our peer support PLUS our intrinsic abilities which will determine where we fall on the bell curve. \\"A+\\"
B002T9H2LK|1.0|Friends, I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since PULP FICTION hit the theaters, and I saw it at least 4 times on it's original release.  But no matter how much of a fan I am, I cannot condone what he has done here.  IB starts with a great premise:  A small unit of American Jewish G.I.'s are sent in to occupied France to terrorize the Germans by ambushing, bush-wacking, way-laying, sabotaging, and (HERE'S THE KICKER) SCALPING as many Nazis as they can.  Seems plausible.  Then Tarantino gathers the entire Nazi high-command in ONE movie THEATER in Paris, and BLOWS THE THEATER UP, killing them all... JUST 3 WEEKS AFTER D-DAY!!!!!!  Yes, Tarantino has KILLED HITLER 10 months earlier than the Fuhrer actually blew his brains out!!!  YES, I KNOW it's Tarantinos FAIRY-TALE about WWII.  But for Christs sake!!!!  I was expecting something on the level of Band of Brothers, and I got a film that is so bad it not only is NOT Mickey Mouse, it ain't even BETTY BOOP!!!!  Some GREAT writing, TWO PHENOMENAL PERFORMANCES (one of which DESERVEDLY garnered an OSCAR for best actor in a supporting role), but this does not make-up for the debilitating historical inaccuracy of the overall production.  I only give it one star because I cant give it NO STARS!!!!
B000001FT2|4.0|If you were to ever own just one Grace Jones CD, this should be it. It is a solid and well put together art nouveau experience. The only downside to this recording, is that is based off the original analog recordings, so the CD doesn't have that current up o date modernly polished sound. Would be better if it were remastered I guess.
1401322336|4.0|As its title suggests, 'Cook With Jamie: My Guide To Making You A Better Cook' is full of useful and helpful advice from Jamie for amateur cooks. As stated in the intro, Jamie's aim is to provide a mixture of basic culinary information and \\"simple and accessible\\" recipes. It's designed primarily for beginners, although there's plenty of information that's handy for more experienced home cooks.    As a reference, the book is certainly comprehensive. There is plenty of standard information on cuts of meat, species of fish, how to properly cut vegetables, and the flavours of various herbs and spices. But the book also provides sections on safety in the kitchen, how and when to freeze food, and avoiding contamination and spoilage. Another idea that flows through the book is flavour matching and achieving \\"balance\\" in a meal. Finally, Jamie gets in a couple of plugs for his organic philosophy and campaigns to get people eating \\"proper food\\", with some thoughts on selecting fresh and naturally-grown ingredients.    Highlights of the recipes include a great Salads section (including how to NOT mess up a warm salad!), plus a very comprehensive section dealing with Pasta. I particularly liked how the Dried Pasta section tended to focus on simpler \\"classics with a twist\\", while the Fresh Pasta recipes tended to be more complex and sophisticated. Included are step-by-step instructions on how to make your own pasta (a variety of types), and how to cook the perfect risotto. The Seafood section also contains some interesting takes on whole fish, such as Mullet with Pancetta, and Salmon with Fennel and Tomato.     The one issue I have with the book is that the Meat and Veg sections weren't so impressive. A lot if it comes across as very \\"British\\" in nature, with lots of stews, roasts, and boiled/steamed vegetables. Now I love a good roast beef as much as the next person, but I think there could have been a bit more variety here. If the idea was to keep it simple, then maybe some more stir fries or curries would have been a good inclusion. Veg section especially would have benefited from more Asian-style dishes to provide a real counterpoint to the boils and roasts.     Really, though, that's a minor criticism. This is a good book. One thing you can never doubt is Jamie's enthusiasm, and this comes through in spades throughout the book. You really feel his passion to make you not only a better cook, but also a better eater, with a strong emphasis on simple but healthy food and more organic farming methods. His extensive knowledge and his ability to communicate it make `Cook With Jamie' one of the best books out there for amateur cooks. Four stars.
0307463745|4.0|For some reason we are seeing a lot of management books like this one: a series of ideas, each one summarized in a page or two. It's the ultimate answer to, \\"What can you tell me in one minute?\\"<br /><br />This book was sent to me for review several months ago. At first I was disappointed. However, on going back to the book, I found some excellent ideas and principles. I'm not familiar with the authors or their blogs. I would agree with reviewers who point out that there's nothing radically new here. However, many of their points are worth stating even if we've heard them before. The authors give these ideas some freshness with new examples or even a new presentation.<br /><br />I especially liked the section, \\"Don't copy.\\" It's true: When we adapt a successful formula, it rarely works for us. There's a hidden ingredient that can't be shared. I also liked the ideas like, \\"Marketing is not a department.\\"<br /><br />My biggest quibble with this book is that I can't figure out the intended audience. If you're powerful enough to implement these ideas, will you be reading this book? Will you seriously make changes based on what you read? For instance, I love the authors' chapter, \\"They're not thirteen.\\" I agree that companies can waste too much time and money policing employees who take a break to use Myspace. But a CEO who really sees his or her employees as unruly teens probably won't be reading this book, let alone be open to shifting gears.

0307456625|5.0|No greater compliment can be given (in my opinion) except that the reader is sorely disappointed to say goodbye.  I am living in a country where books in English are rarely available, and I am sometimes forced to endure dribble and pretend to enjoy it.    Boy was I pleasantly surprised when this book passed into my hands.  I loved the main character before the first chapter was over.    The writing was charming, endearing, and unique.      One of these days, I hope the second book will find it's way here.
1439190275|5.0|Right now, the Atkins diet is helping this 57 year old lose weight that just wouldn't budge any other way. If you're eating 'normally' and feel hungry all the time, led around by cravings, and maybe even get mild indigestion a lot, Atkins may be for you. My introduction to Atkins was in the 70s. The diet has changed a lot, but it is still the only plan that works for me. In my fourth week, I'm down a size, feeling great, and eating plenty of great tasting food (including vegetables and fresh berries). Try that on any other diet when you're old, short, and female. What I need to do to succeed long term: accept that it is a way of life and not just a 'diet.' And, it will become even more lenient as I get closer to my goal. Did I mention that it's pretty lenient already? Yet I'm losing so fast I can see it, and feeling much better than when I was eating a 'normal' diet. And if you look at evolutionary biology, the Atkins diet actually makes a lot of sense.

006145205X|1.0|The recent review of this book in \\"New Scientist\\" was far gentler than it deserved: the author's selective misquoting of science to support the refusal to accept reality that he calls \\"optimism\\" is deeply disturbing.
031606792X|3.0|If I had gotten to the end of Breaking Dawn and found a \\"Note: This book was written as fanfiction and is not associated with Stephanie Meyer in any way\\" it would have made a lot more sense. It honestly reads like fanfiction - and weird, unexpected fanfiction at that. The kind of fanfiction where only the characters' names are the same, the plot doesn't entirely make sense, and metaphorical aliens fall from the sky and build the pyramids.    I read the first three books and found them enjoyable, if a little superficial and melodramatic. I mean, in the entire series basically nothing happens other than Bella and Edward falling in love and him refusing to turn her. Somehow Ms Meyer managed to spin this out for three books - this book was supposed to be the big finale. Bella finally has to face up to what her choice will mean. What will life as a vampire be like - will their love survive Bella's newborn bloodlust?    Unfortunately that is not what this book is about. It is filled with random plotlines that go nowhere, sudden changes in the previous-rule-of-the-Twilight-universe that occur only for the purpose of making Bella's life perfect. There are no sacrifices, no hard choices, no consequences, no responsibilities    The book starts with the lead up to Bella's wedding. Bella wants nothing to do with it - she even closes her eyes while Alice fits her wedding dress so she doesn't have to see what she looks like. This has never made sense to me - Bella wants to spend eternity with Edward, but she won't marry him? Really? Even though it's so important to the professed love of her life marriage seems to mean exactly nothing to her -she has no involvement in her wedding other than turning up. Which is a bit anti-climactic after all the build up.    Jake turns up at the wedding and Bella still tries to both have her cake and eat it too. Up until this point the story is believable. Annoying, but believable.    Then the true randomness starts: ***some spoilers ahead***    whilst on honeymoon Bella is suddenly pregnant. But pregnant with a monsterchild that grows at an alarming rate and is literally killing her. But Bella is suddenly in love with the child and the idea of being a mother (Despite her previous statements about not wanting children).     The monsterchild gets the worst name in the world. The worst name in the world. The sad fact is I've seen/heard it so often now that it doesn't have the same shock value it used to. But when I first read that terrible name I honestly sat there giggling for like five minutes. Really? Did Ms Meyer really think this was a good name? Putting aside the whole cringeworthingly cheesy aspect of mashing the grandma's names together. The monsterchild also ages at a freakishly alarming rate. This provides a plotline that goes nowhere - will the monsterchild die young because she ages so fast? All the investigation of this question happens behind the scenes and the answer is presented, gift-wrapped, at the end.    The other main drama in the novel is the news that the Volturi are coming to destroy them all. Don't get too worked up about it though - it's a massive anti-climax.    In between all this are random, disconnected plot lines that go nowhere. Leah, the only female werewolf in the world, becomes a more sympathetic character and she and Jake reach an agreement to be a separate pack far away from Forks- seeing as they both can't stand being around their unrequited loves. This plotline is initially promising but goes nowhere. Jake gets the worst consolation love prize ever. Ms Meyer apparently forgets about Leah in the second half of the book.    Bella receives a secret message from Alice, since she's the only one whose mind Edward can't read. She spends time tracking down the person the message refers to and figuring out what Alice is trying to get her to do. And then nothing. This also goes nowhere.    Ms Meyer didn't seem to realise how thoughtlessly cruel she was being to many characters. Rosalie - who would never have become a vampire if given the choice, and desperately longs for the children she can't have. Well, Bella didn't even want children but the universe distorts itself so that she gets them. In your face, Rosalie. Jacob - who never gets to escape from Bella's web and who loses all his freewill (and aforementioned worst consolation prize ever). Leah - who finally manages to find an escape from Sam, but loses it when Jake is again ensnared by the Bella-web. Bet Leah just loves being around all these people in love.     And this is all told as if it were a perfect happy ending. And it is for Bella at least. Just not for the vast majority of the characters. Or me.

It even beats the ORIGINAL Star Trek (never cottoned to the Next Generation and such. Waste of time and money you ask me.) I'm 50 and I can't wait for summer every year where I get to watch Firefly in a decadent weekend culminating with Serenity. I don't write reviews. I never liked Joss Whedon or that Buffy Crap. This is Special! And I'll keep holdin' till you get back.

B003CN5SAY|4.0|There should have at least been some deleted scenes here, a gag reel, and why is it that nobody on this show ever did a commentary?    There are also many loose ends that we are left with:  spoilers coming!              It's no surprise that Annie and Wilber end up in therapy, but we don't hear much about it.  Will Conor ever have surgery on his other hand?  What happened to Lipo the dog?  Why did we never see the service for Kimber? Nobody cried? Kimber said she was abused as a child but nothing more is made of this, even when her mother shows up.  Matt finally gets his karmic comeuppance for the season 1 hit and run, but he remains a screw-up.  Will C.T. ever tell the truth about how Gina died?  Etc.  Otherwise, though, there is some great stuff here. Sean goes into a downward spiral of bad decisions, insomnia, and substance abuse because he wants to get away from M/T and his partner but lacks the courage to do it until much later.  Sean and CT finally realize that they need to separate because their relationship is uneven and damaging, just as Sean finally realizes that he cannot have Julia back in his life for similar reasons.  Liz does some bizarre things in this season.    It's not up to the caliber of seasons 1, 2, and 4, but still pretty good.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Too good to be true.  Two music icons.  Two discs: CD for the car and DVD for home theatre system.  15 proven tracks.  At the price of an audio CD, this has got to be the most no-brainer check out of all time.<br /><br />The sound is awesome.  This is a contemporary recording.  Every guitar note and every bass thump is true to life.  I love the sound of real drums, and arguably, the drummer is the third star of this concert.  In a previous tribute to Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" by various artistes, the Bee Gees messed up \\"Will you still love me tomorrow\\" with electronic drums.  Not in this Los Angeles concert.  James Taylor sings the refrain in \\"Will you still love me tomorrow\\".  Unless you are an acoustic freak with a $1,000,000 sound system, you may not find a single flaw in this production.  Totally awesome.  The reviews who say this performance sounds \\"live\\" were not exaggerating.  I upscaled the DVD with a Blu-ray player, and unless the inevitable Blu-ray disc comes with a CD, this is the better buy, as you will want to hear the music (free CD, or free DVD, either way) in your car stereo.<br /><br />The sound level of the recording in these modern CDs is high.  Just a little twist on the volume knob and the the concert can be heard in its full >80 db glory.  Personally, I prefer the dts version of the sound in the DVD, but the difference between dts and 2.0 (no mention of LPCM; maybe LPCM is the implied norm nowadays - it sounds LPCM anyway) is really quite marginal.<br /><br />In the DVD version, James Taylor gives a commentary before each song with his subtle brand of humour, which the audience appreciated.  The chapter stops allows you to skip the speaking and cut straight to the music on the DVD, although I will find it difficult to be tired of listening to the amiable and self-effacing James Taylor.  James Taylor thanked Carole King for writing \\"You've Got A Friend\\" and joked that he got stuck with performing that song at every concert after that for the rest of his life.  Hearing him tell it himself has a different flavour altogether.<br /><br />I read some criticism that the voices of these musical icons were a bit frayed with age.  That was really unkind.  This is a live performance.  Even if they kept their engines on idle mode, they would still outperform most young singers revving their engines at maximum capacity.  There is this quality called \\"Class\\" which does not come cheap.<br /><br />The set comes at a cheap giveaway price for an obvious reason.  These two icons do not have to pay any royalty to sing their own songs.  There are some refreshing changes in the arrangement in some tracks.  They are \\"covers\\" of their own songs.  I would recommend this album (actually plural for CD+DVD)as a very fortuitous gem.ing him tell it himself has a different flavour altogether.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|IRON MAN 2<br /><br />STARRING: Robert Downey Jr., Mickey Rourke, Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Favreau, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Kate Mara, Leslie Bibb, Gary Shandling and the voice of: Paul Bettany<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Justin Theroux<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: John Favreau<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 07 May 2010<br />Review Date: 10 May 2010<br /><br />Surely by now it's no surprise to moviegoers the world over, that sequels almost never live up to the original. Iron Man 2 is no exception to this unfortunate cinematic veracity. However, no attempt to do a justice could have been better; Iron Man 2 is almost as good as Iron Man.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. reprises his sensational persona of billionaire Tony Stark. After revealing his identity as the man of Iron to the entire world at the first film's close, Stark's ego has naturally skyrocketed through the roof when we catch back up with him here.<br /><br />The plot centers on Stark facing three major conflicts and several smaller ones. The two initially of upmost concern, are that, A: the reactor in his chest keeping him alive is also killing him, and B: the government is threatening to seize control of his Iron Man suit, which would realistically be the case were one to possess such an invention in reality.<br /><br />Additional conflicts include Tony balancing feelings he has for his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) with their working relationship, an ego trip between him and his best friend `Rhodey' (Don Cheadle), and if all this wasn't enough to deal with - eventually Stark finds himself squaring off with not one, but two villains who begin working together.<br /><br />The scumbags are played flawlessly by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell; both truly gifted actors - and big action summer flick or not - Iron Man 2 showcases their talents repeatedly. Their characters are vastly different but yet compliment one another well dramatically.<br /><br />Rourke plays Ivan Vanko, a Russian terrorist hell-bent on revenge against Tony motivated by a personal vendetta. Rockwell plays a sleazy arms dealer named Hammer, who always seems to be technologically half a step or more behind Stark Industries. Vanko is sinister and macho and Hammer is hilarious and flamboyant; a great combo. I wish Vanko had a bigger role in the story.<br /><br />I was relieved to see Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard as `Rhodey'. I can't say who is a better actor between the two - but Howard isn't as likeable as a buddy character as Cheadle is. Howard is more convincing as a villain or someone with a darker edge; see Big Mamma's House, Hustle and Flow and Crash.<br /><br />The only real problem I had with the movie, takes place on a racetrack. It starts out really nicely - Rourke's character Vanko dons two powerful electrically charged whips that can cut cars in half, which was awesome (but of course they can't cut the Iron Man suit in half, because then we wouldn't have a movie now would we?).<br /><br />The part of this I couldn't digest, lies in Vanko being able to take several blows to the torso from a vehicle repeatedly slamming him up against a fence; from which he leaves with only so much as a torn pant leg... no death, no internal bleeding, and he walks fine for the remainder of the film, and none of the other characters ever utter a word about this unbelievable miracle. But hey - at least everything else is for the most part plausible, and everyone in the audience seemed not to notice this either, so maybe I'm just nitpicking.<br /><br />The film also doesn't have quite the same charisma the first one had and I suspect this stems from the change in screenwriters. This picture focuses more on the comedy, which is understandable as it was written by Justin Theroux who also wrote the crack-up Tropic Thunder. As in that movie, the humor of Iron Man 2 is hysterical, but at least for me, it softened the seriousness and overall merit of the film in a few scenes.<br /><br />We do get a lot more action this time around though, and it is much appreciated. Lots of Shoot `em up scenes and Scarlett Johansson, who plays Stark's new employee Natalie, will drop your jaw with her martial arts skills. I've heard she spent several months training, and it really paid off. And my God, was the sound incredible in the theater when Stark would take off via his jet fueled suit. The vibrations were so intense; it literally felt like you were right there with him.<br /><br />I have heard so many gripes from fans that felt director John Favreau gave himself too much screen time in this one. I loved Favreau's performance and I hope he's in even more scenes in Iron Man 3. I'll take it a step further and add on a request that my man Favreau put his pal Vince Vaughn in a cameo in the third installment as well. Who wouldn't enjoy seeing a witty verbal standoff between Tony Stark and Vince Vaughn?We do get a lot more action this time around though, and it is much appreciated.

0061478784|5.0|I saw the animated version first and fell in love with it. I thought, this is so wonderful I can skip the read (and I did) for some time, but then I bought it, and it sat on my bookshelf for longer. Then a day ago I picked it up and couldn't put it down. I sat in the kitchen in a chair till 3:30 in the morning. I woke up a few hours later (red eyed)and although my eyes stung I reached for the book and staggered into an easy chair. It went on my daily rounds and when I was at the doctor's office people bent down in front of my book (while I laughed harder than I had since I can't remember) to read the title of the book. I didn't even acknowledge their presence. It didn't matter. I was only somewhat there. Most of me was at Howl's watching Sophie (who has so much more to her in the book). She has some issues of worth, but she's much stronger, funny, opinionated! Speed Boots and Weed-Killer (don't say I didn't warn you)! There is an extra sister (the movie ommited) as well as having greatly altered personalities to fit their own version. I still love the movie, but you do your mind a great disservice if you overlook reading this exceptional treat! I look forward to reading the other two in the series by Diana Wynne Jones. If it's anything like this one I will be sleepless and laughing hard!
B002HR1W1K|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray version, which had the best picture AND sound of all my blu-ray discs. This is the funniest absurdist comedy I've seen in a long time. For me it ranks right up there with A Fish called Wanda, Dave, Life of Brian, The In-Laws, Army of Darkness, Death Race 2000, Galaxy Quest, etc. - I highly recommend this movie to all!
B002UNMWAG|5.0|The original movie was better, but when does this not happen. It does have a good amount of quality twists and turns in it. Follows the same principles and is well worth seeing. I'll repeat that yes the original was better, but just like the god father one and two are well worth seeing.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|I'm a fan of Dennis Lehane, the author of the book, and was thrilled when I found out that Shutter Island was going to be made into a movie with such a renowned director and talented cast. I still remember reading the book for the first time and calling my husband at work -- he'd all ready read it - just to say \\"wow\\" and to discuss it with another person. I think I'd figured out the big bad secret by the end, but loved how the author pulled it all together.<br /><br />So, when I saw the movie I did so from a \\"knowing\\" perspective and so my experience was actually vastly different from someone who hadn't read the book. If you're unfamiliar with it, I think it's easy to go in and think that the ease or difficulty with which you figure it out is the point -- and it's not. Because I knew, I got to enjoy the execution of the story and the acting and directing choices that were made and could only be noticed either if you have the knowledge or in retrospect. I had extra moments of delight because I could think, \\"Oh, I see what he did there! What a great reaction shot under the circumstances!\\" The movie rewards your understanding what's going on. So, even for the people who figured it out and were perhaps disappointed, it's worth another viewing with complete understanding. I also loved that one of the extras on the bluray discusses this exact thing.<br /><br />The movie is atmospheric, Scorsesian, and Hitchcockian. The story and direction compliment one another. I think, at its core, this is a very human stories about both the limitations and the limitlessness of the mind and heart. The protagonist, Teddy Daniels, remains a complex and compelling figure. Dicaprio clearly respected that complexity and committed to bringing it to his performance. The rest of the cast also does a stellar job and it is impossible to single anyone out, because they were all up to the challenge.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this movie and this author. So, even if you don't buy the movie but are a reader, you might want to check out more from Dennis Lehane.ight want to check out more from Dennis Lehane.

B002JCSWVG|5.0|This movie is about more than just Mandella, and more than just rugby. Clint Eastwood did a wonderful job balancing the two and telling a complete story of how two different mens lives came together to rebuild a nation. Taking you through the early days, the prison, and onto the rugby field to give you a true perspective this movie is going to be a classic for a long time to come. I'm trying not to spoil to much of the movie even though we all know how it turned out lol.

B003BKF696|1.0|Sooooooo boring and uncreative.  I liked their last release but this has NO memorable tracks.  Total garbage.  MAJOR letdown.  All these great reviews are by fanboi's who'd give them 5 stars no matter what.<br /><br />From an independent listener this is completely forgettable.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I won't dig too deep into reviewing this particular CD because there are a lot better reviewers than me who already wrote something about it.<br /><br />I will just say that the soundtracks for The Twilight Saga are getting better and better. I'm a music lover in general, with a very open mind I must add, so I'm probably not the most reliable reviewer when it comes to reviewing music. As it was the case with the New Moon soundtrack, I was already a huge fan of several included artists. Some of those names are Muse, Florence and the Machine, The Dead Weather and Beck. I have to say that if you know something about this kind of alternative music, then you will absolutely enjoy it. It's rock, alternative, bluesy and also filled with fast beats so you can really listen to it without skipping songs. The \\"New Moon\\" dark vibe is almost gone in this one, the songs are really faster and lighter. I could easily listen to most of the songs while working out or doing something around the house.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Twilight Saga in general is mainly targeting teen/YA population, who don't understand good music yet because they are either too young or used to popular genres. So be careful believing the negative reviews, not all of them are constructive criticism.<br /><br />As I've said above, there are much thorough reviews if you're interested in each song separately, but thank you for viewing my opinion!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend this CD to my friends, who are not Twi-hards for sure.
B001U6YI92|5.0|I have ever seen this film in such a brilliance of resolution and color. Most copies I had seen before this of this movie were pinkish in color and just look beaten. If your a fan of westerns this remastered version is of amazing quality and endurance. You will see this movie like you never have before with the just amazing and absolutely brilliant restoration they did. So much detail you can see flies in the air, and the whites of thier eyes.
B002WY65VU|2.0|J.Rossi, I'm with you on this.  I kept drawing parallels between this movie and Heroes.  The characters actions and motives were confounding (I know, it's a movie!).  I couldn't help but think that their destruction of the gift shop was actually depressing.  Wanna blow off steam?  Blow away a zombie or two.  Everyone in the main cast was supposed to be hard-core survivors, right? It was bad enough they trek across the country to go to a theme park, just so a kid could be a kid, but flipping on all the power in the theme park AT NIGHT??? Come on!  The other thing; why did everyone insist on killing zombies with guns instead of the big @$$ trucks they were driving?  And what the heck was Bill Murray thinking AFTER he got hit with the golf club?  I mean seriously, he thought it was a good idea to sneak up on armed zombie killers?  And the reaction of Woody after this?  I mean, that's when I finally gave up.  Couldn't tell if the movie was supposed to be tongue in cheek or dark comedy.  Anyway, the best part is the beginning, when we go through the rules.  Would not recommend.
0891419063|5.0|I am not a big book reader, but I decided to read this one after only seeing 3 episodes of \\"The Pacific\\" on HBO. I have not seen the entire HBO series yet.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. Reading Sledge's story of what happened in WWII is truly unreal. I have always appreciated and respected the heck out of all of our Veteran's, but after reading this book, I have developed an extreme new appreciation for the sacrifices they made for us. The simple gruesomeness of the war is something that people couldn't even imagine if they wanted to write a fictional story of the war.<br /><br />I think everyone needs to read this book whether they enjoy war novels or not, because I think everyone needs to know what these men went through. Obviously I have never been in war, but from reading this book, there were a few nights that I literally had nightmares...<br /><br />You will be happy you bought this book.

B002WY65W4|5.0|You just have to see this movie to understand what its about. It is just an absolutly hilarious take on horror films. This movie has more humour in it than shawn of the dead. It does have a great story line in it, and the actors do a great job keeping a straight face when you know they want to just be rolling around laughing. Anyone that likes horror comedy needs to see this film.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|The X41's are a really good headset, but I'm not convinced they're the best. A friend of mine has a much older pair of turtle beaches, and he said he could hear things that I couldn't so I'm not completely sold on these. That didn't stop me from paying $200 for them though.    The good:    -Great surround sound.  -Comfortable  -Greatly improve your gaming.  -Voice and game volume controls.    The bad:    -I have to put new batteries in every other day.  -Sometimes the plug-in socket comes loose and you have to jam it back in.  -Can't hear myself talk like the video says you can.  -Sometimes makes random cracking noises.
0393072231|5.0|This book explains how Goldman-Sachs, by fraud, caused housing prices to rise artificially and collapse; leaving millions of Americans with homes worth half of what they paid for them.    This book is written for the average-guy like me.    Some good humor in the book. For instance, \\"You homeowners left with homes worth half of what you paid are: \\"Renters with debt\\".\\"    I summarize the the book, making it even easier to understand, why you were defrauded by Goldman-Sachs and our government; under the \\"comment\\" button below.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Everytime I see this movie I notice something new in the plot. The first time you watch it, it will have you looking for what could possibly happen next. This is a greatly written story line, and the actors in it portray thier characters beautifully. The acting is worthy of an award no doubt.
080214473X|4.0|My reaction; Logically , how is it sanity to be so idealistic to rationlize an attempt at correcting another Nation's anarchy, by sacrificing American lives ?. I just can't wrap my head around losing American lives to try in vain to save a recalcitrant country from it's own fate, regardless of the possible European colonial roots of this anarchy. Furthermore, I feel it's time  our Elite, suffering from cracking faces ( addicted to spending and debit ) spend more time using their nobler intentions instead of using their balls. This post-cold war euphoric fog has been around for way too long and people need to start dealing with our children's future economic reality. Getting back to this book, details, angles, tons of it. This story is not a Cowboy and Indian story, it's a story of 100 or so of our American boys being thrown into a hellish meat grinder of a nightmare. Some other food for thought, No Somalia 1993, No Rwanda 1994 ?, on a whim or not commander.
B00275EGX8|5.0|Plus more, I have no idea why they let james cameron cry because he didn't win over this film. It portrays strong characters when they need to be during tough times. This movie also puts emphasis on a part of war most dont touch on. These are the guys never talked about but always known about and a must see for everyone who wants another take on the reality that is war. I served in Iraq and the scenes in this movie are earily realistic to how it looked over there. The back grounds, the behaviors of animals and locals. All of of it realistic enough to give shivers down the spine of a vet that served more than one tour in Iraq. If you want to see what iraq looked like, watch this movie.
0307454541|4.0|This is a fast-paced, exciting novel with twist and turns abound. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|The story line sucks. It's almost like he tried to take the best thing from final fantasy video games, and halo and make a movie out of it. Predicitable outcome. This movie wasn't half the hype people made it out to be. Your money could be much better spent. This is mediocre at best.
0307454541|4.0|Given the multitude of reviews that aptly summarize the plot, I'll just say that The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a very interesting amalgram of murder mystery, family saga, love story and financial intrigue, as well as one that casts light into the darkest corners of society. But what is most special about the book are its very well-developed main characters: journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the unforgettable Lisbeth Salander, who is the girl with the dragon tattoo, a social misfit and an ingenius computer hacker. While I enjoyed this book very much and am about to start on the second book in the trilogy to find out what happens next with these characters, I admit that I found the first half of the book to be fairly slow-moving and felt that I needed a scorecard to keep track of the many characters with unfamiliar names that are introduced during this time. However, virtually from the first page of the second half of the book, the mystery started to kick into high gear and I didn't want to stop reading it. I'd very much recommend this book to readers who enjoy a mystery with a multi-layered plot and strong characters.
B000K7UG34|5.0|Most people by now know this is an amazing movie, but in blu ray high def video and audio it makes the experience even better. This is a great movie, based on a true story, with great nervous comedy. Well worth it to be in anyones collection.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|If you are ur daddy's boy, this movie is not for you. But if you have your parents who hate your gut and you are not good enough for them no matter what you do, this is the movie for you. This is not an action flick. This is a talkie movie. So, if u r one of us, you know exactly what this movie is talking about. Otherwise, nothing will make sense.    Picture and sound quality is very good for this old flick.  Love this movie. 5 stars!
B001EN71CW|5.0|This series was better than a lot that we have put up with. How stargate made it over this series is just amazing. This series has incredible make up, creativity, and imagination. They actually built the ship to make the show instead of just piecing together stages. Each person and each part of the movie has its own feel, and its own impressiveness. This would be well worth your money and a steal while its 25 dollars.
B002ZG997M|4.0|There's something about Denzel Washington that makes just about anything he appears in all the cooler.  Take The Book of Eli for example: a post-apocalyptic action vehicle that comes off being better than it rightfully should be thanks to the starpower of Washington, who plays the enigmatic, and dangerous, wanderer Eli.  Eli is westward bound and carrying a precious text that soon becomes coveted by the maniacal Carnegie (Gary Oldman) after Eli sets foot in his town.  It isn't long before Eli and young Solara (Mila Kunis) are on the run, all the while dodging other hazards of the barren wasteland.  While The Book of Eli hardly offers anything new to the post-apocalyptic thriller or action genres, it does feature some gorgeous cinematography and camera work, as well as the most inspired direction to come from The Hughes Brothers since Menace II Society.  The action sequences are violent and surprisingly creative, and Washington manages to be equal parts charasmatic and stoic: he truly makes the film as worthwhile as it is.  Oldman is his usual good villainous self, Kunis is easy on the eyes, and supporting turns from Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Tom Waits round things out nicely.  All in all, if you're hoping that The Book of Eli is another The Road, you're sadly mistaken, but if you set your sights a bit lower, you'll come out plesantly surprised.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|The acting is ok, the graphics are beautiful, and the technology they portray is kinda fun. Its worth renting but not buying. Once you watch it you can guess the storyline pretty much. They did a good job on the makeup for the actors though, and even if your not interested in the story it is a decent movie to watch.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|I just got the blu ray edition of Terminator. First off dont expect it to look like current HD movie transfers. It just aint going to happen. The Movie is 26 years old and shot on(35mm negative). Now the big question is this...Does the Blu-ray offer a significant upgrade to the DVD Special Edition. Well, the DVD special edition was sourced from the new HD transfer..So, how much better is the HD souce...Fact is, it is better but NOT mountains better. There are more special features on the 2-Disc DVD Edition...I would guess that we will be getting a Remastered Blu Ray soon with all the special features and more...BUT until then, if you wanted the best possible picture and sound of this movie, the blu ray is the way to go...

B002N57KG2|4.0|I'll begin by saying that this film is a great tribute to Farrah Fawcett. And the media should be ASHAMED of itself for virtually ignoring her death!<br /><br />This is an interesting movie in that while it appears to be a race across the country, it is a clever group of different comedy acts that are united in a single story.<br /><br />The story basically involves an illegal race across the country. But we appreciate the film fully if we just enjoy the separated acts of comedy rather than just being concerned with who will win the race.<br /><br />The 2 main rivals JJ and Jim (Reynolds and Martin) do some deliberate cheating to try to get ahead of the other. But there is something really satisfying about how in the final fight they are fighting back to back.<br /><br />Victor (Deluise) is an especially interesting character. He seems to be this hopelessly trapped naive and bumbling child in a man's body. But through a conversation with Farrah Fawcett, we come to understand him as he endears himself to us.<br /><br />Farrah Fawcett's character is especially worth some attention. She seems to start out as this annoying nature lover; but when she is in a sense kidnapped, she adds just the right element of sadness to this comedy: \\"This isn't a joke anymore. I've been kidnapped.\\" A touch of sadness that breaks the comedy a little prevents a comedy from becoming an utter farce. But her character expands to the point where she understands JJ and Victor. And she goes from being hurt and depressed to actually cheering Victor on to win the race. And she gets annoyed by an action that costs them the race.<br /><br />The Dean Martin / Sammy Davis Jr pair is great also. They disguise themselves as priests; Dean Martin is more often than not sloshed; and of course he is always after women. And there is something too comical about seeing him dressed like a priest punching different members of the cycle gang out.<br /><br />Roger Moore has an interesting role in that he is playing a character who is impersonating Roger Moore.<br /><br />Another point worth mentioning is the role of the highway cops who are often outran. The film may appear to be anti cop. BUT, while the cops are often outran, the director is usually careful to film and show that the cop wasn't actually hurt. (Annoyed and outran yes. But not hurt or killed.) And the 2 women wearing tights with their shirts wide open who were seducing their way out of tickets all the way have a hilarious comeuppance when they are caught and stopped by a woman cop. And later we run across 3 cops on the smarter side who stop the sheik and show themselves to be great drivers. Who could forget the Fire Bird cop's line: \\"God damned camel jockey!\\"<br /><br />I shouldn't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. But there is a hilarious end that defies the typical happy end for the main characters JJ and Victor.<br /><br />Overall it's a great group of comic acts that are unified in a race with just the right touch of sadness. If this film does not become a classic, it will certainly have a cult following.<br /><br />Love always FarrahAnother point worth mentioning is the role of the highway cops who are often outran.

B0039TD7PY|5.0|I've always loved the music of James Taylor and I've always loved the music of Carole King. What is incredible about this CD is that they take the music from both of them and put it on one album and they sing it together. There is also a DVD, but I don't like to watch concerts on DVD because of them. I work out quite a bit because it decreases your risk of cold sores and this is my new favorite workout CD. It gets me excited everytime Carole King hears the earth move under her feet or James Taylor sings about Fire and Rain. I too have seen fire and rain, so I can relate to the depth of his music. If you had fire and rain at the same time you couldn't really have fire because the rain would put it out. My dad used to smoke a pipe, but he wouldn't smoke it out in the rain because whenever he did, the pipe would go out. He'd get all mad and blame it on Panama before drinking another beer, but that kind of display made me what I am today. What am I? I AM fire and rain that makes the earth move under your feet. That's why my friends call me earthquake. I would get this CD if you want to either smoke a pipe, work out or build a fire. It's good for all of those things. I think my waffle is ready now, so I'm audi 5000!
B001OQCV6K|3.0|The sound quality leaves a lot to be corrected. Great movie, Great story, and Brilliant HD quality but the sound quality is hard to put up with. It goes from so blazing loud to queit you have to adjust your volume during the movie. Really who wants to do that? they shouldn't have tried so hard on the loud end.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|I normally heart TP and the Heartbreakers, but I just can't get into this album. It sounds like Phish to me and I think Phish could literally be the worst band in the world. Tom Petty always sounds whiny, but in his older stuff, the whining was easier to handle. Maybe I'm just getting older and wishing he would record an album full of songs like \\"Don't come around here no more\\". That is my favorite TP song. It also had a great music video that was themed like Alice in Wonderland, which ironically was released again last year. They cut up the girl like a cake at the end and ate her. This album just sits there and doesn't do anything for me. I like Ronnie James Dio music, so I was hoping for something that was more of a tribute to Rainbow in the Dark since Dio was not in the best of health. Instead I got whiny, jam band, blues music. You can hear music like everyday in the little bohemian section of Gretna where the street vendors sell pie. It's a lot better than this. I remember \\"you got lucky\\" was a video that Mtv used to play when it started. It kind of had a Mad Max vs. Star Wars feel to it and no one got cut up and eaten like a cake at the end. That transformation was OK, this one kind of makes the innocent roller skating days seem like a foregone conclusion.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This movie doesn't end like you would expect from a clint eastwood film, but then again what movie is expected from clint eastwood. Huim and his son do a great job in the creation of this film. It really touches on interracial barries, as well as moral lessons in honosty and integrity. This like most clint eastwood directed films has great acting, and a good story line. He does a good job creating a dark image of himself.

B000RZIGSG|4.0|\\"Flashdance\\" was a landmark film of the 1980s, singlehandedly sparking the fashion trends of off-the-shoulder shirts, legwarmers, and ripped jeans, not to mention fueling the aerobics craze. It was a fun film at the time, but the set-up seems stranger now than it did then: A fresh-faced young woman, Alex (Jennifer Beals), is a welder by day and exotic dancer by night, while she lives in a converted warehouse and dreams of being a ballerina. Alex has saved enough money to support herself if she should join Pittsburgh's dance repertory company, but she's too intimidated to apply. One evening her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri) sees Alex dancing at Mawby's Bar and is enchanted. The beginning of a bumpy romance.<br /><br />I've been revisiting movies of my youth to see if they were really worth remembering. \\"Flashdance\\" is. There must have been a lot of knock-offs, but I haven't seen anything quite like it since. Much of the film's appeal is in Jennifer Beal's unaffected performance. Alex is so natural that she easily overcomes the hackneyed plot and its various contrivances. Alex is also only 18 years old (and looks it). I haven't seen a film that treated a young person as an adult in 20 years. And, of course, there is the iconic dancing. The dance sequences aren't as technically impressive as I remembered them, but Jeffery Hornaday's jerky choreography creates a strong image. It has an aggression that I haven't seen in a dance movie since.<br /><br />\\"Flashdance\\" is, on one hand, a by-the-numbers combo of a romance and one of those films where the protagonist must find the courage to pursue her or his dreams. But it's a particularly good example. Not only does it create strong visual and auditory images -with its chart-topping, award-winning soundtrack, it's not entirely saccharine. The working class characters seem authentic, and their dreams don't always come true. Produced in 1983, there is a bit of 1970s malaise in the film that prevents it from getting too sweet. That's the kind of thing I noticed in retrospect that was not obvious to me the first time I saw it. So this one is worth a re-viewing.nd of thing I noticed in retrospect that was not obvious to me the first time I saw it. So this one is worth a re-viewing.

0691142165|5.0|\\"This Time Is Different\\" presents a quantitative history of financial crises -debt crises, bank crises, currency crises, inflation crises- with an eye to commonalities in the run-ups and aftermaths of these crises. Of course the authors' point is the reverse of the book's title: this time is never different. Economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth B. Rogoff demonstrate that financial crises have a lot in common, regardless of when and where they take place, by showing us the data. The obvious conclusion would be that financial crises are predictable. Although they state that \\"it is beyond the scope of this book to engage in a full-fledged analysis of early warning systems,\\" the authors present much of the information that would be required to develop a predictive model.<br /><br />Whether it's predictive value is fool-proof or not, I was fascinated by the data and analyses. The authors have pulled together an unprecedented amount of data for various types of financial crises over a period of centuries. They found it particularly difficult to find reliable data on domestic debt, which they call \\"an exercise in archeology\\", but managed to uncover enough to claim that domestic debt is the vital piece of missing information in understanding debt intolerance. Reinhart and Rogoff use data on 66 countries that account for 90% of world GDP over nearly 8 centuries, with an emphasis on the past 2 centuries, for which they have the most data (and which had the most crises).<br /><br />\\"This Time Is Different\\" has 6 parts but it effectively has 3 topics: sovereign and domestic debt and default, banking crises with some forays into inflation and currency crises, and the current global financial crisis, otherwise known as the Second Great Contraction. Looking at the charts, it's clear that serial default is historically the norm. And, though advanced economies may outgrow patterns of default, they never outgrow banking crises, which are surprisingly similar in their causes and duration in advanced and emerging market economies. Up to this point, the authors generally use data from the past 2 centuries. It is only in the chapter on default through debasement that they include the past 8 centuries.<br /><br />The chapters dedicated to the US subprime crisis and Second Great Contraction draw on data since 1900 only. The authors attempt to develop benchmarks for gauging the severity and duration of a crisis based on data from past crises. This is the most opinionated section of the book, even though the authors' views are empirical. They present both sides of the argument for and against the housing boom and large US account deficits, but Reinhart and Rogoff conclude that rising asset prices, slowing productivity, large current account deficits, and sustained public and private debt build-ups create, if not a looming crisis, an accident waiting to happen. They admit, however, that it would have been difficult for policy makers to act in time even if they had seen it the current crisis coming.<br /><br />\\"This Time Is Different\\" seems to have been written both for economists and interested laypeople. It's packed with data, easy to understand, but sometimes repetitive or more verbose than necessary. It looks like each part was intended to be relatively self-contained so that readers may study them separately, but this makes for repetition. I found this mildly annoying. Then again, the repetition may be helpful when I use the book as a reference later. The style is a quibble, but the information within is engrossing.

B000O77QD8|5.0|This movie shows you the true side of what happened to these warriors after thier celebrity lives and even during them. It does take some of the glory away from the marines, but it shows you that a navy corpsman was involved in the flag raising. It also shows you how hard it made thier lives, and the struggles they went through during and after the war. Bringing reality and harshness into what is a lot of the time seen as glory without pain, this movie is a must see for everyone.
B001JE25ZE|5.0|Back in the day I used to read young adult horror like it was going out of style. It got boring. I felt it the genre became predictable and uninteresting. I even used to watch horror movies and stopped for that very reason. How many times can you reinvent something over and over again before it becomes tedious?<br /><br />Then Twilight appeared on the scene and turned me off completely from the vampire genre. Now to make things clear, I never read the books. I read excerpts and heard of the premises. I had no desire to pursue reading them. Obviously Stephanie Meyer is doing something right, given how popular the series is but the story and her writing style is not for me.<br /><br />But I digress! The point to what I stated above is that it's been a really long time since I've read some good horror. I didn't expect this story to \\"wow\\" me like it did. Thank you, Richard Matheson. I confess that this story made me fall back in love with vampires.<br /><br />There are major discrepancies between the movie and the book so for those of you unfamiliar with the book's premise, here is a summary from yours truly:<br /><br />Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth. Every man, woman, and child has turned into a vampire is out for his blood. By day, Robert hunts those who seek to ultimately kill him. At night, he fences himself inside his house, drinking away his sorrow and almost-suicidal despair. How long will he survive before his own madness and loneliness overtake him? Man by nature is a social creature and is not meant to be alone.<br /><br />*** warning, there will be spoilers so be on the lookout ***<br /><br />Definitely a must-read! It's gripping, intense, and thought-provoking. I couldn't put this book down until it was finished. It is possibly the best short story I've read! Forget the movie. The book is worth the read.<br /><br />Matheson's description of the psychological aspect concerning Robert Neville's struggle is superb. It is existentialist in nature with minimal dialogue throughout the story. It is mainly a story of contemplation, exploration, and survival. I think that is what I like best about it. It is not your typical horror story consisting of gore or action packed into 170 pages. It is bleak and retrospective, clearly written with the human condition in mind.<br /><br />As a reader, I felt Neville's anguish, depression, and anger. At moments I even questioned why he decided to live in a world that wanted him dead. Hell, I wanted a drink or two!<br /><br />When Neville meets Ruth with such skepticism, as the reader I wanted to knock him over the head and shout, \\"Get over yourself! Trust her!\\". I thought his paranoia was unfounded, until I read the ending.<br /><br />hook.<br />line.<br />sinker.<br /><br />It's depressing, yet poignant and appropriate. The concept that the infected humans evolved, making him the only non-infected human alive (and consequently a legend to be feared and hated like the vampires of old), is ingenious.

B00275EHJG|5.0|In the film world, a trilogy can be a good thing, a chance to tell a long story over three parts, enabling us to become emotionally attached to the characters and the world they live in. Unfortunately however, many times the third film in the series can be tired and worn out, the result of the creativity and spark dying out long before the cameras roll.    Thankfully however, that's not the case with Toy Story 3, which is the perfect ending to the series, and a moving and emotional one at that.    Picking up several years after the end of its predecessor, Toy Story 3 finds Andy, now 18, packing up and heading off to college. Woody, Buzz, and all his old toys now spend their time in a toy box, essentially forgotten. When told that he either has to store them in the attic, throw them out, or donate them to a daycare center, Andy sets events in motion that will lead to what is essentially judgment day for Woody and the gang...the fact that Andy has outgrown them, and that they are essentially, in Andy's words, junk, facing an uncertain future.    Of all of Pixar's movies, it's my opinion that Toy Story 3 is by far the most emotional. While a simple story about the toys we all know so well, it tackles the issue of mortality. Unlike what Randy Newman's famous, \\"You've Got A Friend in Me\\" song says, friendships do die. Relationships drift apart, and life changes, and not always for the better. And it's here that Toy Story 3 shines. It may not have the most action of the series (Film 2 holds that honor), but it does have the most heart, as it follows the toys we all know and love as they struggle to find their place in a frightening world where they could be thrown out, discarded, and destroyed at any time. This is a film about loss, the ending of relationships, and the fact that nothing lasts forever.  Nowhere is this more apparent then the film's final act, which is the most dramatic of the entire series (and without question, Pixar's greatest drama scenes), and concludes with an ending that had me in tears, and at some points, sobbing.    It's always hard to see great things coming to an end. I've grown up with these characters, having seen the first film in grade school, and now seeing the gang's final adventure shortly after graduating from college. But, as cheesy at it sounds, it's a relationship I'll always treasure, and will be grateful for enjoying. As Buzz says early in the film, it's best to go out on a high note, and Toy Story 3 accomplishes it with ease. In my opinion, it's Pixar's most emotional film, and their most bittersweet...but even through the tears, you'll walk out with a smile.
B0024RID60|3.0|I have always loved this one.  One of my 3 favorite Stones albums, along with \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile On Main Street\\".  \\"Some Girls\\" has it all---the dance groove of \\"Miss You\\", the in your face rock of \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\", the humor of \\"Far Away Eyes\\".  Every track is great.    But...    The comments on this site about the poor audio quality of the remaster are right on the money.  Worst remastering job I have EVER heard.  Just awful.  A friend of mine had purchased the remaster and I listened to it, and then listened to the original Virgin release I have.  I was amazed.  The reviewers are absolutely right.  Stick with the original here.  Unfortunately, it is now very had to find.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have many execise DVDs and non has made me convinced to workout regularly. Jillian has done it. Her 20 minute segments are hard but very very effective. In the beginning it seemed impossible to complete the whole Level 1. However within three days I was up at second level. Now after 10 days since my start I am losing weight and getting stronger and shaply.  Strongly recommended.
B002ZG9828|3.0|Well I just got back from the midnight showing of this movie and I have to honestly admit that I am both surprised and disappointed in this movie. Being a HUGE Jonah Hex fan since the 70's, I have been anxiously awaiting a good movie adaptation of the comic books, and after watching this movie, I am still waiting.<br /><br />Josh Brolin did an okay job in his portrayal of Jonah Hex and there were times in the movie that I thought he aced it, and then there were other times that I found myself very disappointed. Megan Fox was actually a good surprise because I don't particularly care for her, but she did an okay performance as the whore Leila, which I can't imagine was much of a stretch in the acting department. John Malkovich of course turns in an outstanding job playing the villain, Quentin Turnbull, and I really couldn't find any flaws in his performance.<br /><br />The storyline was reminiscent of the [[ASIN:B00001ZWTT Wild Wild West]] remake with Will Smith and Kevin Kline in that it had to have a ridiculous plot element of some kind of super weapon instead of sticking with a good old fashioned and believable western plot. Although admittedly this plot line was much better than the giant mechanical spider, but not by much. I found myself wondering why the powers that be who oversaw the making of this film didn't make sure it had a reasonable plot line and script like such movies as; [[ASIN:B00005NTNW The Outlaw Josey Wales]] and [[ASIN:B00006FDCJ Unforgiven]] both of which starred Clint Eastwood, who in my opinion should have been picked to play Jonah Hex if they movie was made back in the 70's or even early 80's.<br /><br />I did however find myself not being to upset over the supernatural element that was showcased in this film, even though it doesn't appear in the original comic books. Although there were some elements of the story that were totally wrong and should have been corrected and/or included in this film. They are as follows:<br /><br />1. Jonah Hex carried two ivory handled Colt Dragoons in .45 caliber. One in a single holster, and the other tucked in behind his gun belt.<br /><br />2. Jonah also carried a Bowie knife hidden in the back of his jacket where it could be reached by grabbing it from the back of his neck.<br /><br />3. Jonah also occasionally carried and used a tomahawk, not a hatchet.<br /><br />4. Jonah was scarred by the Apache Indians after killing the Chief's son, not by Quentin Turnbull.<br /><br />5. Jonah was never married until years later when he married a Chinese girl named Mei-Ling.<br /><br />6. Jonah absolutely never carried two Gatling Guns, one on each side of his horse. This is absolutely ridiculous and was a major sore spot with me in this movie.<br /><br />7. Crossbow pistols that shoot sticks of dynamite? Okay then, why didn't they also include the mechanical spider and really make it believable?<br /><br />8. This movie came in at just under 90 minutes, so why not put in an additional 30 minutes and show the true origins of Jonah from his childhood up to being sold into slavery to the Apaches by his drunk and abusive father after his whore of a mother left him alone with his father.<br /><br />9. Also with the additional 30 minutes, they could have shown how his good friend Jeb Turnbull actually was killed in the POW camp escape after Jonah was framed by the camp commandant.<br /><br />10. And finally, there should have been a few more scenes of Jonah as an actual bounty hunter, even a montage of sorts would have been okay.<br /><br />If you are a Jonah Hex fan you are going to be very disappointed with this movie. If you aren't, or perhaps are just an occasional fan, then you may find it more enjoyable than I did. For all of us true Jonah Hex fans, I would recommend sticking with the comic books both the original series and the new ones that are out, you will be much happier than watching this horrible big screen adaption. I just picked up this Jonah Hex origins graphic novel[[ASIN:1401225500 Jonah Hex: No Way Back]] and am very pleased with it. I highly recommend that you read it as well.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Rabid Jonah Hex Fan<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.well.

0446567337|1.0|This is a screwed-up thing to make a romance novel out of.  (Yes, I realize it was written for women with no exposure to the military and only romantic notions of undying love to go on.)  For deployed military personnel, a spouse or fiance is often all that's keeping them going and suicide can result from things like this.  Romantic?  Hardly.  Savannah is a no good cheatin' 'ho.  No way would John sell his father's coin collection to help her out when the new hubby gets cancer after that-- Made your choice tramp! No you can't come back when he's dead!  Save your money, buy something else.  This is just sad.

B003PWPGT0|5.0|Answer: Everyone wins.  You can hear the ghosts of the oldest blues artists, Led Zeppelin, Allman Bros, and MoTown on display on this record.  I listened to it all the way through two days in a row after buying and I truly believe this is a classic.  Absolutely fantastic effort by Tom and the boys.  PS, Mike Campbell's guitar tone has never been better.  Guess that '59 Les Paul he picked up helped a bit..  :)
B00005BJ2O|3.0|While this is an enjoyable cd it is not a real soundtrack! It is missing about half of the songs! Songs like \\"The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)\\",\\"Meet You in the Red Room\\",\\"The Show Must Go On\\", and \\"Like a Virgin.\\" And out of the song that are in the movie, they are completely different! I suggest if you buy this cd, also by the [[ASIN:B00005YW4Z Moulin Rouge 2 Soundtrack]].  This was a soundtrack released later that included the missing songs and also included the \\"movie versions\\" of the songs that were changed on the original soundtrack. If you buy both you will have all the music from the movie. But if you buy #1 or #2 either by themselves. You will be missing songs.
0375842209|5.0|Just finished \\"The Book Thief\\" by Markus Zusak and can't remember the last time I cried that hard. Upon finishing, 2 thoughts simultaneously came to me: 1) This book makes my heart hurt, and 2) This is possibly the best ending to any book I have ever read. Even though it's long (400+ pages) I highly recommend this book. The humanity contained within is overpowering and beautiful and something all of us should experience.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I'm still ambivelent about this film, \\"The Book of Eli\\".  Visually, the directors succeed in painting a totally stark, blasted, and scorched-earth wasteland.  \\"Life\\" has been reduced to a constant struggle for survival - food, water, shelter, and protection.    As the film progresses, you discover bits and pieces of what happened to produce a world like what you are viewing - obviously some kind of nuclear war - but, also you get hints about book burnings - particularly religious writings - which were blamed, by some, as the cause for the war and the resulting devestation.    Enter Eli, who is guarding some kind of book, who believes he has been told \\"by a voice\\" to take the book west.  Also, we meet Carnegie, a violent, ambitious leader of a large gang that has control of at least one city.  Carnegie is searching for a particular book that he believes will give him control over the masses of people.  We even get a hint that prior to the war, Carnegie was some kind of \\"successful\\" religious preacher.  We soon discover that the book Eli is guarding is the very one that Carnegie desparately desires.    So, we have two people who both cherish the Book, but for vastly different reasons.  Eli sincerely believe's the Book's message - he attempts to live by it - he wants to spread the book's message to as many people as possible because he believes it contains the Truth and that only by following its teachings will people find true meaning for life and real peace with one's self, Man and God.  Carnegie wants the book to use for his own purposes - to sway and use people in order to achieve power and control.  The Book to him is only a means to get what he wants - he doesn't really believe it's message - he isn't going to live by it's message - he just values it for it's influence over people.    I'm still mulling over the messages of the film, but it does make you think and the story pulls you in.  The film's major theme, I believe, is that although there are \\"wolves in sheep's clothing\\" mascarading as \\"servants\\" of God - don't reject the Truth because of the fakes.  Be discerning about who or what you put your faith in.  Truth can be used for good or for evil.    Overall, I think this movie is definitely worth watching - good acting, good pacing, good plot and character development - interesting twist toward the end.  Highly recommend.
B003JYOFIW|3.0|The first six songs are spot-on DEVO doing what they do best.  The rest only have elements of what could have been good songs, but are betrayed by weak melodies, lousy lyrics and re-tread synth effects. But, hey, at least they're doing something.  And, quite honestly, those first six winners could run an extra five minutes each and I'd be in highway cruising heaven!  Hopefully remixes will be forthcoming, as well as a follow-up album with a complete lineup of great tunes (like on Oh, No! It's DEVO! or New Traditionalists or Freedom of Choice).

B00280LYIC|5.0|Do you like fantasy? Myths? How about the Greek Gods? If you answered all of those questions 'Yes!', then this is the book for you. When a young, middle school aged boy named Percy Jackson finds out that he is a son of a Greek  God, or &#34;demigod&#34;, he decides to go to Camp Half-Blood, a place filled with satyrs, tree nymphs, and more! Percy is liking it there when his half-goat half-human friend, Grover, introduces him to &#34;Mr. D&#34;, the camp director, and they find out that something is up. A few days later, Percy is offered a quest! Together, the three friends Grover, Annabeth, and Percy embark on a thrilling adventure to prevent World War Three... or start it.    I found this book fast-moving and full of adventure. The world of the Greek Gods is cleverly animated with the present reality. This stunning writing debut by Rick Riordan is, well, magical!

B00275EHJG|5.0|Funny how time flies.  Once upon a time Toy Story's animation style was the leader of the pack and the state of the art, now it's considered standard fare.  But that's ok; once the shine and polish wore off of it the true value in the franchise was exactly what the title says- the Toys' Story.  Thankfully, that hasn't changed.<br /><br />The movie opens with an incredibly over-the-top playtime fantasy starring the entire cast that leaves you a little breathless and kinda nostalgic with some of the cameos involved.  The plot focuses upon the inevitable period of transition in life: Andy is heading off to college, leaving his childhood behind, and both he and his sister Molly have to decide what to do with their old toys. His destined for the attic, save Woody, whom Andy decides to take with him.  Molly donates hers to the local day care, including her Barbie doll (raise your hand if you can see it coming!).  A mistake has Andy's toys left out for garbage; Woody goes to rescue his friends and they manage to all end up at the day care center- a Garden of Eden for toys.  But there are snakes in the garden as things are not quite what they seem, leaving them worse off than before.  Now they have to find a way to escape and make it back to Andy's before he leaves.<br /><br />The typically superior Pixar animation is flawless, and the script is excellent- I'd have to say this was more for adults than kids. Woody remains his loyal, inventive self and there's always the iconic Buzz Lightyear gravity (and logic)-defying flight across the room.  Sight gags abound and one-liners zing, but the best laughs came from the running jokes about the inevitable `When Barbie meets Ken' scenario (\\"No one else around here understands clothes!\\"), as well as the age-old question about Ken- is he or isn't he?  There's also some hilarious moments surrounding the romance between Buzz and Jessie the Cowgirl: Buzz gets brainwashed by the bad guys and his friends need to restore him to normal.  A tip: try not to be eating anything once Buzz gets his buttons pushed.<br /><br />The key to the Toy Story movies is they never take themselves too seriously even in their sentimental and poignant moments, and there were quite a few of those here.  The villain's character arc is perfectly appropriate for a toy movie, and ties into the main plot of the toy's search for a new home.  The ending definitely tugs at your heart strings but works very well; I honestly couldn't see it coming out any other way.  And as is the current trend in movies, you definitely need to stick around for the credits!  Toy Story 3 runs the risk of being overshadowed by other flicks this summer, but it shouldn't be.

1441412840|5.0|Worthless edition of otherwise phenomenal book!    Buyer needs to be aware of publishing companies antics.  I purchased from Amazon the book \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind.\\"  The edition I purchased was by Martino Publishing Co.  in Mansfield Center, Ct.   Do not purchase anything from this publisher, if you want the truth. All of Murphy's books are excellent!  I had already read his \\"Think Yourself Rich\\" and I loved it.   I just was totally naive to  publishing companies \\"hack jobs\\", a term which had been used in an earlier review about publishing companies for Dr. Murphy's books.    When I first started reading this book, published by Martino,  I ran into several misspellings.   That's when I became suspicious and wrote an email to Martino Publishing Co.  Then I started to peruse the other paperbacks available and reviews on all the books and then noticed the review from MVK.  I complained to Amazon, and the book has been since replaced, but the public should be aware that not only can the spelling be wrong in other editions, but Martino also changed the wordage.  As MVK stated earlier, Amazon should be ashamed of carrying these \\"hack Jobs\\", which does represent an infringement on Dr. Murphy's copyright.  I want to read what Dr. Murphy has to say, and not what Martino restates of Murphy's ideas.  Thank you for reading this and being an informed individual.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The gripping story of sixteen year-old Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games captivated me from start to finish. This book is like a hybrid combination of Stephen King and Stephenie Meyer. It has something for almost everyone: adventure, bloody horror, and even a little romance. I was rooting for the heroine from the beginning. You definately need to read this amazing book!
006112429X|1.0|Shriver's main character strikes one increasingly tiresome note throughout this book (or at least as far as I got, which was almost 300pp.): Mom's cynical, but she repeatedly tries to reach out to her preposterously bad son. Never succeeds but keeps thinking she is going to reach him THIS time...Kid keeps a few steps ahead of her, degrading her and besting her at every approach. Continually she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and tries--surprise--unsuccessful yet again!  Felt like hundreds of times...So much of the book is nonsense:  all the characters are poorly developed and as the book moves along, Shriver gets sadistic, after all, the kid Kevin has to get badder and badder, to keep our interest, right? On page 286 it was easy to spot the setup for yet more sadism (BTW, why would the mother of a psychopath leave her younger daughter alone with him? For that matter, why would the mother even want to have another kid--her son was in diapers until he was 6, just to give you a taste of the pathology in store for you). I gave up on the book at last. What honestly had kept me plodding along was the average of 5 stars so many readers gave it. On page 286 I finally did what I should have done many pages sooner: I read some one star reviews and realized I'd more than had my fill. Buh bye book. Some of Shriver's prose is good, sometimes she has a knack for capturing the moment, but this doesn't come close to making the book worthwhile. I seldom read this far and stop, but reading it was feeling more and more like a chore; now I feel liberated!
B0036B8MXC|4.0|This series is extravagant! There's lots of action and in between it all is lots of drama sexual activity. The CGI blood is a little much but other than that it's quite awesome and I'd recommend this series to anyone who loves gladiator type action. Oh and seeing Lucy Lawless naked is a major plus as well
B003HE2B6C|5.0|I've been a fan ever since the beginning, and I have to say that Shout It Out is the music I've been waiting for them to make all this time.  It represents a return to their R&B roots and it's essentially a celebration of what it means to be Hanson.      It's hard for me to pick favorite and least favorite songs, because honestly this is one of the only albums of any band that I've ever owned that I can listen to repeatedly without skipping a single song.  If push came to shove, \\"Give a Little,\\" \\"These Walls,\\" and \\"Me Myself and I\\" are probably my three favorites, while \\"And I Waited\\" is one that I don't quite love just yet, although it's growing on me quickly.    If you're thinking about checking out this band, THIS is the album to listen to first.  It would give a casual listener a chance to get what these guys are really all about musically. While I have enjoyed all of their albums to date, Shout It Out really is (for me) their finest and most honest work to date.

B0012GVKW8|5.0|First of all IGNORE the BAD blu ray REVIEWS of PREDATOR.    This will always be one of the GREATEST SI-FI/ ACTION / THRILLERS of all time, as will as one of SCHWARZENEGGER`S GREATEST movies.    Like the the PREADTOR this movie grabs from the spine and never lets you go and will leave breathless, packed with nerve cracking suspnse, will made special effects & pulse pounding action, from movie makers MEGA ACTION producer JOEL SILVER ( LETHAL WEAPON, DIE HARD & THE MATRIX) & ACTION MASTER director JOHN McTIRNAN (DIE HARD & HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER)    MOVIE RATE 10/10    I have owned the movie on all formats VHS, LASER DISC, DVD and on BLU RAY.    NOTE: I campared it to 2004 to PREDATOR SPECIAL EDTION DVD.    FOX made a proper transfer as good as COMMANDO another ARNIE filck from FOX, the jungles are in more detail like you`ve never seen it before, the sweat on the actors, the night and dark scences, the blood dripping from the leaves and trees, the special effects and the action looks so great, see and hear it like never before.    The sound is the HIGHLIGHT of the blu ray format, the guns, explosions, grenades, the Predator`s weaponry, the background sound of the jungle, the water fall and an OUTSTANDING music from ALAN SILVERSTARI (FORREST GUMP &  BACK TO FURTURE) which gave the movie life, never sounded like that which made speakers roaring.      BLU RAY RATE 8/1O    MY ADVISE TO YOU IS TO GO FOR IT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.....
1591843162|5.0|In Linchpin, Seth Godin describes the sea change that is taking place in the world economy and provides insight into how each one of us can position and improve ourselves to take advantage of the new economy.    Many of us hold the misconception that we ought to be able to find a good job, do what is expected, and that job should pay well and be secure. The reality of the new economy, however, is that if your job is just a matter of following procedure, a lot of people can do it, and your employer can probably find someone to do your job for less than it's paying you.    Godin argues if you want to be successful and be secure in your job, make yourself indispensible - a linchpin. Go above and beyond what's expected. Be an artist at what you do. Connect people. Solve problems. But most people don't want to do this because the resistance (aka the lizard brain, our fear instinct) overwhelms them.    Godin also makes that case that businesses have two options. They can either provide the same product or service as everyone else but try to do it cheaper (in which case a bunch of other companies will be trying to do the same thing). Or they can create a remarkable product or service, which people love and want to pay more for. If you want to do the latter, you have to hire and nurture linchpins.      Personal Thoughts    As an entrepreneur, a lot of the ideas Seth Godin presents in Linchpin resonate strongly with me. I've been making myself indispensable, creating connections, solving problems, and drawing maps for years. What Linchpin did for me is clarify those concepts and cause me to realize they are even more important than I realized.    There are three other important realizations I'm coming away with.        1. I am still playing it too safe, not setting big enough goals, and sort of standing out but not too much.     2. I want - no, make that need - every person who works with me at [...] to be a linchpin.     3. I believe every person can become a linchpin.    Ihave a passion for seeing people to live up to their full potential. Before reading Linchpin, I just assumed that some people just weren't gifted to be artists (in Seth's use of the term). I figured some people were just wired up to be cogs in the economic machine. But, Linchpin convinced me that everyone has the potential to become a linchpin. That's a thrilling realization. More than ever it stirs a passion in me to help people become more than they think they can be.    I highly recommend Linchpin to everyone.  In fact, I believe the insights contained in Linchpin are so important that I'm going to read through and discuss the book with my wife and I'm going to give a copy to everyone I work with. (How's that for an endorsement.)    See my full review and join the discussion at:[...]
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Absolutely amazing and fantastic. What a guy. Wow. I've never bought a DVD before in my life and I highly recommend buying it.
B002ZG997M|4.0|For a post apocalyptic movie, it was pretty good. Not the best as one reviewer said. I would have to give that one to 'The Road Warrior'.<br />There is plenty of action and a moral to the story, which each person can judge for themselves. The casting was very good and Mila Kunis is definitely easy on the eyes.<br />The very ending is kinda hokey, but so are most action movies. Very good rental in my opinion.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Buying those ultra dollar cables is a WASTE of money. I'll put these \\"Basic\\" cables against any big buck brands any day. Those cables are high profits for the seller. Example: Two years ago I purchased a $79 HDMI cable with my daughter's discount for UNDER $5.00.  People should be allowed to profit but come on, that's ridiculous!  These do a great job without breaking the bank. (Take it from a former hig end audio salesman).
B002ZG983M|2.0|To be honest, I loved this movie...for what it was. A light-on-content, heavy-on-style, action-packed romp on the dark side with some humor thrown in. However, compared to what it could have been, and even more so what it obviously, desperately wanted to be, I can really only give it 2 stars.    First of all, the premise is great. A nerdy teenage nobody wants to rise above his status and be someone special. Sure, being a real life superhero is not a feasible means to achieve this, but what could be learned from that? Maybe that you don't need to be a superhero to do great things, just an ordinary person with a vision and some courage? Why not explore the Hit Girls and Big Daddys of the  world who feel wronged and overlooked and retaliate in negative ways, such as teenage school shooters or lovers who kill out of jealousy? There are a lot of things that could have been done with this, but the producers didn't bother.     The moments with Kick-Ass are genuinely funny, especially his naive, good-intentioned grandiosity. An outcast teen on a mission could have been a really sympathetic character if developed properly, but he wasn't. He was overshadowed by an aforementioned 11-year-old killer.    Where oh where do I begin with Hit Girl? I'll admit, her attitude and actions sequences were fun to watch and I was imitating her for days (in private, of course.:) But on reflection, what did Hit Girl add to the story? There was no real motivation for her character to be that way. We just are supposed to take for granted that this is normal and acceptable for little girls and their fathers, which ruins my attachment to and belief in those characters.    Furthermore, I AM offended by this film, like a lot of other reviewers. The violence, profanity, and other \\"adult\\" elements were excessive. I'm far from prudish, but at some point, it gets to be distasteful and loses its shock value after a while. Which wouldn't bother me so much if it was well-done, added to the story, and hadsufficient moral context/criticism, but it doesn't. Hit Girl especially is offensive to me because it's glaringly, painfully obvious that the audience is supposed to be blown away by her ultra-feminist edginess. I'm a woman who can fight with the boys and beat up grown men just like that! I have a perfect body, am totally athletic, oh so cute, and am as tough and unladylike as can be.  I always get what I want. Oh, and at the end, I'm so smart that I can get into high school right without any formal  education whatsoever! Best of all, I'm only 11! Are you as great as me at 11? Take that, patriarchy!    As an 11-year-old, I might have collapsed under the weight of 3rd-wave feminist pride. As an older woman, however, I find this utterly unrelatable and an insult to my intelligence.    Chloe Moretz herself isn't a bad actress. She loves and cares about her role, which makes her that much more fun to watch. (If the actors don't care, why should we?)She does over/underact in a lot of scenes, but she dominated other scenes and has potential in general. I'll pass judgment on her when I see her in more substantial roles. She's got a way to go yet.     Acting overall was hit-or-miss with all of the characters, but especially Hit Girl and Big Daddy. The teenage boys, Red Mist, and Frank D'Amico stole the show in this area, in my opinion. The teenage girls, in writing and in acting, were the worst of the bunch and just unlikeable. What I found appealing about Red Mist in particular was how he straddled the line of good and evil. He was also one of the more realistic characters.    Production values are clearly low-budget, but I actually think this enhances the quality of the film. It gives it a cartoonish feel that I find entirely appropriate for a movie based on a comic book. It also softens the blow of the many brutal murders that would have otherwise been unwatchable.    By the way, I write and produce \\"offensive\\" media of all kinds for a living and as a passion. So dissenters are going to have to do better than throw the old \\"You're such a prude\\" line in my face.      So feel free to buy this DVD and watch it while you're cleaning the house, winding down from work, etc. But for best results, turn your brain off first if you're 16 or older. If you're younger than that, you really shouldn't be watching at all except, perhaps, with adult supervision.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I LOVE these headphones.  I will go out of my way to look for them in brick and mortar stores.  It's upsetting that less and less stores are carrying them, so I have to rely on getting them online.  It's a rarity that I find them hanging in the headphone section in the stores.  The sound is great, and, if well cared for, they will last a good eight to nine months, which I think is fair for the price.  Other headphones, like earbuds and over the ear headphones make my ears bleed, while the behind the head headphones have uncomfortable ear pads, and these are the only ones I can wear comfortably.  If they could solve the problem of the sound going out in one ear (which will eventually happen), I'd love Sony forever!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was the most amazimg fiction book I have read in my life.  Markus Zusak has outdone himself with this remarkable book.  The characters are very life-like and the way he tells the story keeps you reading to the end.  This book follows no formulas in its plot.  It is simply a book about life and relationships.  This book is worth triple the listed price.
1416550550|5.0|The delivery was quick and shipping was fair.  The story is wonderful - good plot, well written and totally enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anyone.  I read it for a book club and can hardly wait for the discussion.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is one of those rare gems that often gets overlooked. Operating with the knowledge that Fox was trying to can the show, Joss Whedon didn't go for the big, flashy visuals, but instead treated every episode like it was going to be the last one he got to write. Fans of the show, such as myself, who have watched the commentaries, note the chemistry between the actors and the passion they put into their roles. When anyone asks what it is about, it is hard to avoid the term \\"space-western\\", something that made many dismiss the show with a laugh. But when you watch it, it is almost impossible to pull away from it. You'll be singing the show's catchy theme for days, and you'll find yourself looking for any excuse to describe something as \\"shiny.\\" I now own Firefly on both regular DVD and Blu-Ray...the only item in my movie collection I can say that for. And at $28? You're not gonna find a better price for a brand new copy like this.    Amazing TV show at an amazing price...what are you waiting for?

0756656230|1.0|My wife and I are both big fans of Legos, and I bought these books for her, in the hopes of seeing the typically nice job DK does of displaying something's visual history.    Both of these books devote a very small amount of pages to Lego's history, showing woefully few photographs of older Lego sets, Lego sculptures, and related items. The majority of the books is devoted to multiple page spreads of JUST the products which Lego has currently on the market. The photographs of these products are not even very interesting, and could have been lifted directly from Lego's own marketing material, for all I know.    Its a dull work which almost reads like a product brochure, rather than what it purports to be, a tribute to a very fun toy with a long and interesting history.    When my wife looked at the book, she politely asked me to return it, which I did.    VERY DISAPPOINTED
B0033KR5YS|4.0|OK, first the pros. The music is pretty fantastic -- at least, if you're a lover of Prokofiev, as I am. No complaints there! The recordings and interpretations by Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Opera & Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre is top-notch. Gergiev is one of my favorite interpreters of Prokofiev. And the value -- 14 CDs featuring six operas, with several of the recordings otherwise out of print -- is pretty extraordinary when you think about it.<br /><br />Now the cons. You know how the package looks like a crate? Well, that's basically what it is. Only it's coated cardboard, and not particularly sturdy at that. Mine came with unavoidable-looking bends and wrinkles. Inside the box? 14 white paper sleeves to hold the discs, which are unceremoniously stacked together in a pile. Kind of disappointing. (Couldn't they have at least color coded them by opera?) There's a thin plastic \\"window\\" in the front of each sleeve so you can see which disc is which. There's also a booklet inside that includes a quick two paragraphs of liner notes on each opera, written by Andrew Huth, alongside the usual recording credits and track listings.<br /><br />Notice anything missing? NO LIBRETTI! (Or librettos, if you prefer.) This is kind of a big deal for me. Not that I regret buying the set -- at the price I got it, it was absolutely worth it. But you know what would have been nice? A link in the package to a webpage on Decca's site where you could download PDFs (perhaps with a special download code contained in the package, if they were worried about security). Instead, I'm scrambling now to find alternative sources for the libretti in English, so that I can follow along as I listen. I guess that's the peril of buying a \\"specially priced\\" set.<br /><br />In sum: outstanding music and performances, and good value for the money (IMO) ... but you also get what you pay for! Knowing what I know now, I'd have still bought this set -- but the barely-there packaging and lack of librettiwould have definitely given me pause.<br /><br />EDIT: By request, here's a breakdown of the set's contents.<br /><br />CDs 1-3: Betrothal in a Monastery (152:27)<br />CDs 4-5: The Fiery Angel (118:37)<br />CDs 6-7: The Gambler (114:44)<br />CDs 8-9: Love for Three Oranges (101:58)<br />CDs 10-11: Semyon Kotko (136:46)<br />CDs 12-14: War and Peace (230:27)
B003PWJS9Y|5.0|In these troubling times, a little lighthearted enjoyment is a nice--perhaps needed--diversion.  DEVO hits a home run with \\"Something For Everybody.\\" The band sums it up quite frankly in the song \\"What We Do\\" with the lyrics \\"what we do is what we do, it's all the same, there's nothing new...\\" It may not be new per se, but it sure sounds fresh and unique--moreso in these days of canned, corporately scripted music and lyrics.  Reminiscent of DEVO songs of yesteryear, but adding the superior sound enabled by today's technology, the album is, well, pretty darn cool...and a whole lot of fun to listen to.  Take a run through the samples on the deluxe 15-song version of the album available on Amazon under MP3 Downloads, and I think you'll agree. Nice to have you back, DEVO!

B003PWH4JA|5.0|It's hard to find quality Rock N' Roll nowadays, but if The Gaslight Anthem proved anything on their sophomore album, it was that it could still be done. Revisiting it again, it's still as classic and good as the day it came out. Mixing punk & rock influenced by Tom Petty & Bruce Springsteen, The Gaslight Anthem could have been happy in the sound they carved out for themselves. But no, The Gaslight Anthem instead drops most of the punk, and becomes a full on rock band. The results? As Brian Fallon sings at one point, \\"Who does it better than we do?\\"<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />American Slang<br />Bring It On<br />The Diamond Church Street Choir<br />The Queen of Lower Chelsea<br /><br />The only thing that's changed for the band really is the music. They still can craft a great song with excellent lyrics, Brian Fallon can still burn out a note like it's nobody's business, and they can still crank out a memorable hook when needed for a song. So for the music, as Brian Fallon, they've moved away from the 59' inspired sound, and moved on along the rock timeline. This time, they've moved closer to their influences. I could honestly see/hear Bruce Springsteen singing half this album. It has his lyrical sense, it's grandiose feel, and his musical sensibilities. But, The Gaslight Anthem doesn't try to copy it, but rather, pay homage to it. The album is also a lot tighter sound-wise. While you had ballad-type songs, punk-type songs, and general rockers on their last album, it sticks mostly to the rockers. The closest the album gets to slowing down is \\"We Did It When We Were Young,\\" but it's not as much slow, as it is emphasizing the vocals & the lyrics with a more minimalistic approach for most of the song.<br /><br />Overall, listening to this album over 5 times now, I can safely say it gets better with each listen. Each song is an all-American story set to the beat of a great rock tune. It may be a short album, but it's a solid one. Maybe not as classic as its predecessor, but it's every bit as good, in a different way. One could say that they're trying too hard, but it is working. If anything, American Slang is proof you can still find Salvation by the radio.a different way. One could say that they're trying too hard, but it is working.

B001R4CKGU|1.0|I bought this book after reading a very positive review in the NYT.  What a mistake!  This book ranks near the top as a horrible read, and I would give it \\"zero\\" stars in that were an option.  There is nothing engaging in either the story, or the style of the book.  Don't believe any of the positive reviews.  I'm convinced that the author must have several family members, or some very loyal friends to write such glowing reports.
B003AYZBGQ|4.0|An interesting, compelling insight into the goings-on behind the recent near-collapse of Wall Street, written by Michael Lewis who has a knack for story telling that's easy to read and understand. He writes how the very ratings agencies that were supposed to police financial risk had allowed toxic and exotic financial products to be traded; those sub-prime mortgages bunched up into bonds. How the incentives for people on Wall Street got so screwed up that the people who worked there became blinded by the folly of turning high risk, no-documentation home loans into what became their undoing.<br /><br />What makes this book more interesting, is Lewis' sometimes humorous portrayal of a handful of Wall Street outsiders, including one with a bad eye and Asperger's syndrome, who had the smarts and foresight to see the pending doom, and bet against the market to make a fortune.<br /><br />Yet, most of the people who played a vital part in the demise of some Wall Street firms, the tanking of the market and the world's economic recession ended up leaving with bucket loads of cash. The firms that should have been cut down to size were saved by the government, only to make a huge windfall and continue to pay the very incentives that drove Wall Street bankers to make the bad deals in the first place.<br /><br />Recommended reading for anyone who wants to understand what was really going on behind the scenes in plain English that reads like a novel with characters you'd think could only be dreamed up.

0307454541|1.0|Larsson's book is the most boring and tedious mystery I have ever read. I usually read one mystery a week and have done so for at least 20 years so I have read at least a thousand. The Washington Post hyped this book at \\"wildly suspenseful...an utterly engrossing thriller.\\" I found it about at thrilling as watching an Elmer Fudd cartoon and as suspenseful as an I Love Lucy comedy. Larsson is a windbag who does not seem able to spin a neat narrative. My advice, don't waste money or energy on this utterly boring mystery and instead get a good one by authors like Dick Francis, P.D. James, and Rex Stout.<br />William E. May
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the first workout video that I actually raved to everyone about (and still do). I'm not even a workout \\"video\\" person. Why? Because most of them are cheesy and usually make you spend 45 minutes of your day doing silly aerobic moves or put more emphasis on fun rather than kicking your butt and giving you a workout that's worth your time. But this video has moves that are super simple but super challenging and heart-pumping. And the best part? It's only 20 minutes a day! Perfect for busy working people like me. I can roll out of bed, turn on the tv and be done with my workout for the day in 20 minutes. Don't assume it's not a long enough time to work out...this video is non-stop circuit training so believe me--you'll be sweating and out of breath at the point where you start to think it's not getting any harder. It's definitely a 5 star video, but for those that get bored of the same exercises, be warned--there's only one workout, 1 for each of the 3 levels. So it can get boring if you get tired of the same exercises every day. Then again, it's only 30 days and you progress from one level to the next. Anyway...It's awesomeness. Buy it. You won't regret it.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|This is one I really just assumed I would like. I did but not in the same ways I anticipated nor anywhere near as much as I expected. The direction and acting are all up to snuff, of course. The camera work is great, depicting a stark and spooky place that none of us would want to go to, be it as a guard, physician or inmate. This is a crew who really know movies from each of their respective roles and for the most part I don't think you will be dissapointed.<br /><br />The problem, to me, is the story, which really keeps you interested and guessing...until you figure it out , which really won't take that long. I'm not saying you will work out all of the details but when you get that little tickle early on and think you have the gist figured out, guess what? You do. The only thing worth staying to the end for is to find out why and how, which is really not that satisfying or even remotely believable.<br /><br />Of course you may think it's great and if so, great, it's money well spent. Let's just say I went to the RedBox for this and if I had shelled out more than a buck to see it I would have probably been a bit more critical.

B002ZG983M|4.0|A high school nobody and comic book aficionado (Aaron Johnson) decides to become a real life superhero (despite the lack of superpowers), christens himself Kick-Ass, and promptly gets his ass kicked by a couple of street goons.  This tips us off that we are not in store for the typical superhero movie.  Displaying incredible courage-slash-unbelievable stupidity, he persists in his mission and is drawn into a war between a drug kingpin (Mark Strong) and a couple of Batman and Robin knockoffs, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), who is the real thing.    Some may be put off by the violence and profanity, particularly since many of the characters are so young, so be warned: this film deserves its R rating.  If that doesn't bother you, you're in store for a very funny comedy with plenty of exuberant action scenes. Moretz steals the show and Cage is hilarious channeling Adam West while in his Big Daddy persona.  Johnson is low-key but likeable, which is just what his character requires.

0061537969|5.0|When I read that this book has a race car driver as one of its main characters, I was dubious. Thank heaven I decided to try it anyway!  I loved Enzo, the dog who narrates the story. By page 3, I had already shed a few tears, and laughed out loud. At the end, I was sobbing and smiling through the final pages. A sweet story and characters that really tug at your heart-strings.

B001HN694K|5.0|This is actually a sequal to the original \\"Disney\\" animated film. If you have read the book, you know how whitewashed some of these can be.  NOT THIS!  They rate it PG, and that is pushing.  I'd say PG-13 with no issue.  It shows a changed venue in Wonderland, and changed characters.  That said, I am a regular adult fantasy reader, and while not as bloody, it is superior to the \\"lord of the rings\\".  Both the characters, and special effects are supurb, and I highly recommend it.  Not, however, for young children.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Its been a long wait, but the series is finally released.  I loved this show growing up.  Its got a witty dry humor that appeals to the intellectual buried deep within us all. The series centers around the daily trials of socially outcast Daria Morgandorfer as she enters a new school and attempts to fit in or annoy those who do.  Some will remember Daria as the brainy girl from Beavis and Butthead.  And if Beavis and Butthead embodiment of all that adults fear from the youth of tomorrow, Daria is the flip side of that same coin.  Smart, funny, and often intellectually stimulating which is saying a lot for a cartoon.  I highly recommend the series.  Although the writing may be a little simple and crude during season 1, it gets better as the character development progresses.  Luckily, this set is the entire series,plus both movies.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|...so says the sticker on the front of the box. I agree wholeheartedly.    Rather than try to establish a specific set of criteria that my music MUST adhere to, a la the HIP movement, I try to cobble together a general idea of what performances should sound like based on what I know of the composer. I like my Beethoven to sound fiery and noble.    This set by Emil Gilels is exactly what I was looking for. His playing, accented by DG's outstanding sound engineering, walks the fine line between emotion and technique effortlessly and makes every piece is a joy to listen to. He can unleash a torrent of passionate music when necessary, but he isn't afraid to draw back and show Beethoven's subtler side. His absence of annoying mannerisms allows Beethoven's genius to shine through, almost as if you're listening to old Ludwig himself.    The only fault I can find is that this isn't a complete set. Sonatas 1, 9, 22, 24, and 32 are missing, but the quality of the others more than make up for that. Just compare the clips of Gilels playing the named sonatas to other performers and I think you'll see what I mean.

B003INJETO|3.0|[[ASIN:B003INJETO Road Salt One]]  As a Pain of Salvation fan, which you most likely are if you're reading this, you must understand that Perfect Element part 1 is not going to be recreated.  And it's absurd to think that even possible in my opinion.  Along with this point, in my opinion it is the open-mindedness of Daniel (not to mention his emotion and vocal range) that has kept this band among my favorites since they first came out.     I do understand some of the comments I've been reading here and elsewhere about being disappointed about this release.  But at the same time, what an extraordinary emotional journey it is.  Just like every other POS release, Road Salt One takes hold of you and allows your brain to be taken out of your control.  Now some of you are right, it's not as technically demanding.  And as someone who loves bands like Between the Buried and Me and the work on John Petrucci, I get the lure of that type of music.  However it is difficult to find music more moving than POS (without being corny and lame) in my opinion.      I find it hard to believe that someone who has enjoyed all or most of POS's releases thus far will not enjoy this record.  Tracks like \\"Sisters\\" and \\"Where it hurts\\" are litterally breathtaking.  The lyrical content combined with the raw feel of these tracks is something reminiscent of perhaps the raw emotion of the latter works of Tom Waits.  I mean that type of record does not come around very often.  For your sake, do not miss out on the chance to experience the feelings that Road Salt One evokes in you.  And let it be known there are still those beautiful climatic moments in many of these tracks which may be the only true trademark of POS.      Update:  So after another few months, I've decided, while this is a good cd as far as most bands are concerned, everyone is right... these guys are slowly going downhill.  The music on this album does not have the replay value that their former albums had.  Still worth the buy, but this album is fading out of my rotation at an alarming rate.
1597801577|3.0|This book has a great concept, but was poorly executed. It is a draining read, with poor character development.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I think nostalgia is clouding your judgement... Do you really think that the aliens in the cantina for example look more realistic than the Navi in Avatar or that Bespin looks more realistic than Minis Tirith in Lord of the Rings?<br /><br />It all comes down to how the effects are used. That has not changed one bit since the days of the original Star Wars. There was a hell of a lot of movies in the seventies and eighties with atrocious special effects done practically. Just as there are a lot of movies today with atrocious effects done digitally.<br /><br />Do you think those old movies with stop motion dinosaurs looked more realistic than the T-Rex in Jurassic Park? That those old Titanic movies that sunk a model boat looked more realistic than the sinking in James Cameron's movie? That 'The Sands Of Iwo Jima' had more a realistic looking war than 'Letters From Iwo Jima'?<br /><br />\\"I'm sure you can think of some, like the new King Kong or Spiderman Trilogy, if anyone thinks that crap looked real you need your vision checked.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, because the stop motion puppet in the 1933 King Kong and Superman hanging by wires in front of a green screen were sooooo much more realistic.<br /><br />The problem is not with modern effects. The problem is that now that anything can be done easily and simply using CGI they have a tendency to go way overboard to the point where it doesnt look real anymore. When they were doing things practically they were forced by necessity to keep things grounded.
1594488878|5.0|While there's no denying that Juliet, Naked hits a lot of typical ground for Hornby - relationships, adulthood versus psychological \\"childhood,\\" pop culture and its influence on us - it in no way diminishes the sheer heart and soul of the book, much less its surprising complexity and ambiguity as it comes to an end. Juliet, Naked is the story of Duncan and Annie, a couple who have been together for a long time...and then they're not. How this all involves Duncan's idol, an obscure Dylan-esque musician named Tucker Crowe, and his string of failed relationships, is for the reader to discover. But the story is hardly the point here; as always, what makes Hornby's books so rich and wondrous are his complex, nuanced characters, and in Tucker, Annie, and Duncan, Hornby does some of his best work. Hornby juggles multiple points of view perfectly, creating very distinctive voices and perspectives for each character, and he allows the characters to define the story, all the way to the perfect ending, which neatly sidesteps every cliche and does something remarkable all its own. It's another fantastic book from Hornby, and it's a joy to read, but a sadness to wrap up.
0380729407|2.0|I don't quite understand how this happened. I read other books by Bradbury, and enjoyed them thoroughly. This time - a flop. Every element of this book holds on its own. The plot is quite engaging. I enjoyed the philosophical ruminations about time, death, and the origins of the carnival. Even the style, considered apart from the plot, is gratifying. Yet, when all of these come together, the whole is much less than its parts. What could be scary, becomes boring. Would be poetic language verges on ridiculous. Don't get me wrong - Bradbury is a great writer, and I will keep reading his books (fortunately, many still to read). It is just this book, that, for me, was very clumsy.
B001FB5634|3.0|This is not primarily an apocalyptic movie.  The cataclysm that overtakes the earth is never shown, never talked about, and never defined.  It's killed practically everything, including plants, although counterintuitively some humans survived.  The disaster itself is unimportant; the point is that it strips all the non-essentials from the relationship between humans, and in particular this father and son.    This movie shows the love, trust, sense of honor, and even faith between the two protagonists in a world shorn of all such redundancies.  Ten years after the beginning of the end of the world father and son set out for southern climes and, they hope, some kind of respite from the agony of living at the world's finale.  They scrounge for food while half-starved, sleep in old vehicles, and try to avoid the ghastly cannibals and their horror.  The movie is profoundly disturbing at times even though the horror is implied and not shown for the most part.    And yet this bareness, this looking at father and son with all of civilization stripped away on a dying planet, allows us to more clearly see what really matters with family.  Even the mother eventually marched away from her husband and child to die in the wilderness.  But the father carries on, hopeful, and despite a near-lapse or two into the barbarism surrounding him and his son (with the son playing a part in calling him back), still loves his son and instills in him the belief that there are still good guys and bad guys.  And they are the good guys.  At heart, this movie seems to be about what a father would do for his child in the most extreme of circumstances.      It took a while to adjust to the notion that questions and details about what happened and what was going on in the world weren't going to be answered in the movie.  They're extraneous to its point.  But it was still a hard adjustment for me to make.  It was hard to believe, even knowing that the father thought they were under threat, that he would leave a huge survivalist underground cache of food behind.  If he'd had a little more faith, as his son implied when he questioned whether the others they'd heard (actually their barking dog) above ground might actually be more good guys and not bad, they would have been far better off.    It was a risk the father wouldn't take, for the sake of his son.  The movie also avoided the trap of the duo packing all sorts of weapons and spraying lead at cannibals at every turn.  They have one revolver with two cartridges, period.  Realistically as well, the father doesn't engage in heroisms or derring-do when others are taken by the cannibals, for he knows there's nothing he can do.  And he must protect his son.    This show isn't light viewing; it gives \\"bleak\\" a new definition.  But it also boils down to the bare nubbin the relationship between father and son.  If you can stomach it, this movie is an interesting, almost moving look at one such parental tie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I started this book on the way home during an all-day flight. I just couldn't stop reading until I finished. The author weaves in excellent character development to a very twisted plot. It is not your typical mystery thriller, which makes the book so refreshing and very enjoyable to read.
B001QERPDO|5.0|I've had the CD for several months now. I bought it b/c i liked the songs, \\"man who cant be moved\\" & \\"breakeven\\". It took a second listening to really appreciate the album. I have grown to love all the songs, some more than others. I hope to see great things from this band in the future.     I'm reminded of a cross b/t Maroon 5 & Matchbox Twenty.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book was enjoyable and typical Dan Brown suspense. I would have appreciated a different protagonist, as Robert's constant amazement and subsequent epiphanies do get tiring after reading the first few chapters (and after reading The Da Vinci Code). Besides this slight annoyance, it was entertaining to read. If you enjoyed Brown's other books, this one will not let you down. It does have a great ending.
0060723513|4.0|Funny mix of reviews.    The aborigines were magically fed by nature. Jesus magically fed thousands with a few loaves and fish. True or false?    In Marlo's book, a man with a fractured leg is healed and walks without a limp the next day. Jesus tells a paralytic to rise and walk. True or false?    What do you wish to believe?
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is a sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This one, however, focuses more on the troubled Lizabeth and on a sex industry scandal about to shake up the country. While I think it could have focused less on her and more on other characters, the book was still a page-turner, and the plot was still rich with suspense. The author's ability to weave together subtle details that reveal susprises is amazing. It is definitely a fitting book for the second in a trilogy.
0375842209|2.0|it was definetely a nice read but I expected a bit more. It was easy to read and understand but a bit boring, too. What a pitty. I would rather recommend \\"Liverpool Street\\" by Anne C. Voorhoeve. That is much better than the book thief and much more authentic, too.     Weird character of the protagonist and less authentic. Did not like the description of the characters in general. They seem to be so constructed.     I liked the idea of the death collecting the souls but it happened nothing more. Why didn´t Zusak make more out of his brilliant ideas?     Read \\"Liverpool Street\\" if you are interested in authentic stuff or \\"The book thief\\" if you want to read for the sake of reading.
1891252089|5.0|I have a few yoga books, but I never look at them any more since I got this one - this one is the best! This book has a little humor but has tons of great subtle clues on getting into the poses. It is very easy to use while you are doing yoga. I thought all the nearly naked man pictures would get a bit much but you get used to them and it's really just a great book.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is a wonderful e-book. The short stories are perfect for on the go.   I love the stories. They are fun, witty, mysterious, and of coarse Mr. Holmes is a joy to read.   I can't believe the price. This is the best deal (free) I have ever found.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is definitely the best sitcom currently on TV and available on DVD today.  The five main characters are all individually funny but there always has to be one character who stands out from the rest.  Sheldon Cooper is the funniest actor I have seen on DVD since Jack from Will and Grace.      The series is about four geeky scientists (Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Rajesh) and one pretty blonde waitress (Penny).  Sheldon and Leonard live across the hall from Penny.  The communication barrier between the over achieving scientists and Penny the cheese cake factory waitress is hilarious.  Penny and the four scientists get together frequently to have an array of takeaway food, mainly chinese.      I recommend you get together with a few friends, order some take away and watch this series on DVD because you won't be able to stop watching after one episode.  Season 3 is out now, so get watching.    Anna       [[ASIN:B000W91RUG The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season))
B003CFBQBW|5.0|listening to this disc had me all ready to put on my shirt in support of team jacob and hit the theater. it definitely packs a lot of emotion and while stirring the twilight pot for the next installment, it also opens the door to a lot of under-exposed musical talent. whether you're a serious twihard or just a person with a taste for what's new and under the radar... you have GOT to get this CD!

1592289444|5.0|I have had this book for about 35 years. Got it from a \\"throw away bin\\" at the public library.

The author did a wonderful job of describing the hardships & the good times.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Not the biggest RUSH fan, never really was, but went to see this in a local theater tonight and man, what a great piece of work! A unique Rockumentary that has many different dimensions of the band in full view. From the early years through the present, it takes you through their career from album to album in a loose, chronological way. Shows some of the highs and lows and a peak into the creative energy that the band still seems to have. Neil Peart explains his writing style and ideology a bit. There are several concert footage scenes, but if you are going expecting to see a lot of music, you may be disappointed.... for a minute.<br /><br />More than anything, this is a film about real guys who had a desire and need to do what they are doing. Its a movie that touches you. The friendship and brotherly compassion that these guys have for one another is well defined. And though Neil Peart had horrific losses and tragedies in his life some years back, it seems the band has truly come full circle now and are closer than ever. I found the scenes of Peart traveling and speaking of how he and the band handled that period in his life to be a very candid and inspiring. Something positive can come from negatives.<br /><br />Their is a real sense of respect you get to see a few men in their 60's, after doing the same thing for 45 years, still want to tweak their craft and reach to new levels musically. Most bands of their genre live on recycling the past, but that clearly is not the case. It is also good to see such a strong fan base grow with them. That is magical. And they have that. Not just by looking at concert ticket sales for the last 30 years, but by seeing how many people were at the theater tonight only solidified my opinion.<br /><br />So that is what makes this whole film work. Not really just the music element, but the human element. Even if you aren't the biggest fan, you will enjoy the flow, the bands story and Alex Lifeson's witty sense of humor! Its a very well done documentary that has no boring moments. There are many cut away's to other musicians and entertainers speaking about the band that are funny and honest. Aside from Jack Black being in several scenes, Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins)is featured many times as is Gene Simmons, speaking of taking the band on their first major tour. Sebastian Bach is there as well. But it does not diminish the quality of the film. Only makes you appreciate the range of people they have influenced.<br /><br />Overall I will say A+! Great film.See it in a theater if you can, because it just looks great on the big screen and sounds EXCELLENT! Now I too have finally come to appreciate this excellent and classy band. Well done.t has no boring moments. There are many cut away's to other musicians and entertainers speaking about the band that are funny and honest.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought this for a plasma television we have hanging on the wall.  We needed a cable that was longer than the standard 6' cable that came with our components.  I read all the reviews out there and decided to get the Amazon cable.  My thought was 'if it didn't work, I could return it.'  Fortunately that was not the case.  Sound and picture quality are exactly what I expected.  You can't go wrong with this cable.

I am only surprised that it only came as a single disk for standard DVD; obviously with the nearly 3 hour movie there are no bonus items.  I suppose we are all supposed to go Blu-Ray by now, so this was a bit disappointing.

0385532458|4.0|During the past twenty years, best-selling novelist John Grisham has written some twenty-two novels, mostly crime novels involving lawyers and people trying to illegally acquire money. His tales are usually gripping, although some writers complain that Grisham seems to lack the ability to end his stories in a reasonable satisfying manner.<br /> This volume is a collection of seven Grisham short stories focusing on characters in a town with a 10,000 population in Ford County, Mississippi. The stories are very well written and dramatic, and are somewhat humorous character studies. The first story, Blood Drive, seems to reflect the Grisham phenomenon. It is a gripping humorous tale, but its ending may seem abrupt and arguably unconnected with what preceded it. The story is about three young men, one of whom is a drunk, all of whom are dumb, who decide to drive to Memphis to donate blood for a man they hardly know. The story unrolls with episode after episode of foolish decisions on their part, resulting in near death experiences and great harm to them. The drunk disappears and what happens to him raises the questions: Could there have been a better ending? Does the Grisham ending flow from what we know of the drunk's character, since we are told that he was a person who usually stayed at home and passively drank?<br /> This problem of very interesting, even gripping stories with abrupt endings, unrelated to what precedes it, appears in other tales. For example, Fish Files concerns a poor, lazy, near bankrupt lawyer who is miraculously able to settle a case for half a million dollars. He goes off half cocked. He gets drunk, fires his secretary, seeks a divorce, lies to his clients and cheats them, and commits more than a half dozen crimes so that he can keep the bulk of the settlement funds. The ending may not satisfy some readers because, without revealing it, the story just seems to slide away.<br /> Similarly, in Michael's Room a lawyer is made to face a distraught family that he caused to lose close to a million dollars. He didn't do so because what he did was just, but only because he was certain he could win. The depiction of the family is deftly and emotionally drawn, the drama of the encounter is just right, but the ending may leave the reader feeling that it is clever, but not satisfactory.<br /> The book's last story Funny Boy, in contrast, is perfectly told and has just the right kind of tearful ending. It is a pathetic story of a white man, who is dying with aids, who returns home, who is rejected because of his illness and his homosexuality, and who is sent by his relatives to the black section of town to an old woman who agrees to care for him in exchange for the man's family giving her the home she rents from them, free. The man and old woman develop a warm relationship which Grisham describes with skillful feeling, even as he describes the cold uncaring reactions of the white and black citizens of the town and that of the crass black preacher.<br /> In short, the ending issue aside, for at worst this is a small distraction, the stories in this book are good, and readers will enjoy them, even though they are unlike his more successful crime lawyer dramas. Grisham has shown that he can write other kinds of tales.amily that he caused to lose close to a million dollars.

B000M4RG42|5.0|An excellent war-drama, and in my opinion, Clint Eastwood's finest picture. A moving and timeless film. The enhanced 2.35:1 picture is excellent.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I have done a lot of research about the two versions available prior to making a final decision to buy the Oprah version.  Despite many reviews stating the contrary, I actually enjoy listening to Oprah narrating to me as each scene plays out in the background. Her voice did not sound \\"motherly\\" nor did it sound like she was talking down on the viewers as if we were pre-adolescents.  After having listened to her continuously throughout the first 2 discs and still couldn't understand what all the fuss was about, I decided to take out my Planet Earth blu-ray to hear it for myself once again what Mr. David Attenborough sounded like.  Sure, he was a great narrator, and I\\"m sure he did just as wonderful of a job narrating the BBC version of LIFE as he had done with Planet Earth, I just honestly didn't think Ms. Winfrey was as bad as I was falsely led to believe from all the negative reviews on the internet.  I'm glad I got this Discovery version, because the pacing of the program was excellently arranged in ways that never bored me for a minute.  The newly crafted music that Discovery had gone out of its way to compose exclusively for this version was truly beautiful.  I thought it was very convenient that viewers were also given the option to watch the program with just the music playing in the background (there is also another option to turn the subtitle on so this way viewers can read about what's actually happening in each scene if they so prefer to not listen to the featured audio narration work done by Oprah).  Overall, LIFE is a gorgeous visual feast (1080i? didn't even notice.  I thought it looked even better than most blu-ray movies that were allegedly produced in 1080p).  And don't hate me for my personal humble opinion of Ms. Winfrey.....I thought she was excellent.  She sounded like she had a lot of fun working on this film and it also seemed like she truly enjoyed watching it.  All of this was evident by the lightness and enthusiasm in her voice.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|As others have said, this starts off slowly but quickly finds its balance as the actors, writing and production values all come together.  Result is an outstandingly good fantasy/action series that wisely plays it 3/4 seriously and 1/4 tongue firmly in cheek.  Veteran actor Bruce Spence is outstanding as the Gandalf-esque wizard Zed, and I was pleased to see one of the elven lords from LOTR turn out to play the dark lord villain in this show.  I highly recommend this show and give it 5 stars, and I'll be buying Season 2 when it's released in September.  Sadly the show wasn't picked up for a 3rd season so treasure the 2 seasons we did get, a really unique and high value show that will stand the test of time.
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|The movie starts something like \\"This story is entirely fictional.  Any resemblence to any persons real or otherwise is entirely coincidental\\"  Especially you Jenny Soandso.

Listen up Hollywood, ease up on the misogyny and you might get more viewers.  Fox Searchlight Pictures... I mean you.  Welcome to the 21st century.

B000002B35|3.0|as i spoke with the fellas in the band last evening,i convinced them to listen to the pulse cd,since 1 set we perform is a floyd/waters set.i am a fervent waters fan and we are split on the leader of floyd.i even tend to waffle at times.i received the cd in the mail that day.after listening to the gilmour influenced songs that dominate disc one,i was giving david the nod.i must mention ,i purchased this live version because it was recorded to promote \\"The Division Bell\\" which i absolutely love.david is flawless,but the second guitarist threw off the sound in spots.he tended to use different effects pedals on his solos.i was still in davids corner.when we put on the dark side of the moon disc,there stood a substantial hole,an ill fitting performance,a true let down.roger does a much better job on his \\"In The Flesh\\" release.so i was back to roger,and stayed,even through davids work on \\"Comfortably Numb\\".he sounds slow,and there is no excitement,even though he performs all the solo work as on \\"The Wall\\".this was a let down for me,and i went upstairs to watch rogers \\"In The Flesh\\" dvd,which has a better sound,a tighter group of musicians,and an exciting ,powerful, and moving version of \\"Numb\\",trading off solos between Doyle Bramhall II,and Snowy White.....incredible.avoid pulse at all cost,or at any cost.....
1570629706|5.0|Herman Hesse has been a favorite author of mine since college days and Siddhartha, his best known work, is a book I've read a number of times over the years. I shared my copy with a friend who eventually moved away without returning it. I was merely looking for a replacement when I found this version on Amazon. This translation has some subtle differences from the version I read originally that I think make it a better read. There was also a list of similar books that I found interesting and intend to explore. I found the physical book itself a nice surprise-just the right size for travel with a unique dustcover and bookmark. Perhaps the best praise I can give this book is that I'm buying additional copies for friends.
B00004HYLF|5.0|This album is an explosive instrumental venture into electronic fusion of jazz and rock.  Mid-seventies.  It's a step before the digital age - deliciously warm analog tones, but pleasantly seasoned here and there with digital electronic effect.<br /><br />Session-Masters Al DiMeola on acoustic and electric guitars, Stanley Clarke on acoustic and electric bass, Lenny White on all spectrums of percussion....provide stunning, gorgeous and cataclysmic individual compositions within a common concept production that is navigated by the keyboard adventures of the true Maestro of Fusion - Chick Corea.<br /><br />The works are too brilliant to put in words.  It's timeless.  It's just as hot now as it was in the seventies.  These guys know how to play instruments.  They don't muck about with buttons and false effects.  They just friggin PLAY!  It sounds live.  They actually pluck strings.  They play musical instruments.  None of that \\"sampled\\" or \\"looped\\" nonsense.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's totally musically orgasmic.  Once you hear it, you'll never forget it.  It might just become a part of you forever.  It did for me - thirty years ago.  These present days I continue to \\"Return To Forever.\\"  Makes me feel like a \\"Romantic Warrior.\\"  Yep, it's good to be alive!<br /><br />My kids and nephews got this album from Amazon too.  Like hello?  Does a cat have climbing gear?  You should get this album too!  It will become sacred in your life!<br /><br />Cheers! Be well and excellent,<br /><br />Mark
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I have always loved Tom Petty's music, and this album is no exception to that.  This album is different though.  I would call the genre easy listening blues.  it is a mixed between Petty's previous clasics with slow moving/slow rhythms.  I think this album couldn't be better for Tom's age and for the new venture into slower (not slow) music.  Definitely worth the money
B0036B8MXC|1.0|This is one of the most awful films I ever watched. The film is devoid of any artistic offerings and any ideas at all. ALL those who like to see blood all the time, most disgusting killings and butchering of people and from times to times scenes of sex, can waste money on this.  There is neither history here, nor arts. The pity is that the producers disregarded all those viewers who would like to see a new interpretation of the legendary hero Spartacus. But in additon to disregard towards history, one can easily feel a contemptuous attitude towards the viewers' taste.  This is definitely the worst film on an ancient theme I can ever imagine (I am not saying an classical film, as that would be an insult to the latter phrase).  Please preserve your nerves and avoid this film.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I just saw this movie on Showtime and was flabergasted with how good it is.  It is a coming-of-age, comical, dramatic, and engrossing film.  Eisenberg, Stewart, and the rest of the gang are excellent actors.  The SNL comedian duo is funny.  I'm thinking of buying the DVD now to catch all the background stuff.  Also, I knew I had to watch this when I saw Ryan Reynolds in the cable information summary of the movie.  He is on a roll with a lot of these smaller funny and poignant movies.  Check him out in School of Rock.     Rent, buy, or watch this movie on TV, you won't regret it!
0698116496|4.0|Peggy Rathmann's Good Night Gorilla is a parable in which zoo animals, led by a plucky gorilla named Gorilla, stage a bloodless revolt against their guard, Joe the zookeeper.  As Gorilla, having stolen the zookeeper's keys, liberates each animal from its cell, it becomes clear that this story has little to do with zoo animals, but rather examines ways in which power and discipline are woven into even the earliest stages of human life.<br /><br />As Joe, the hapless zookeeper, makes his rounds and says goodnight to all the animals, Gorilla stays close on his heels, releasing all his comrades.  But it's not massacre they have on their minds (despite what Lion's chop-licking gaze at Joe's tender flesh might suggest) or even a chance to live in the wild.  These animals simply want to upgrade their accommodations and sleep in the zookeeper's bedroom with him and his wife.  In this way, the animals are very like human children who challenge the norms established by their parents and society, but whose rebellion is only in pursuit of innocuous ends.<br /><br />And yet these animals live their lives behind bars.  As far as we know they have committed no criminal act.  The bars are only meant to prevent them from acting on their instincts to run away or to commit violence: their \\"criminal psychology,\\" if you will.<br /><br />Aspects of Michele Foucault's theory of \\"power-knowledge\\" help shed light on the seeming paradoxes of Good Night Gorilla, simply by asking us to theorize power not as a negative, obstructionist force, but rather as one productive of knowledge.  Power is not necessarily hierarchical; it operates differently depending on the situation and the individuals who interact within that situation.  Thus, the animals do not necessarily want to rise up against their keepers as we have become used to assuming, but only tentatively challenge some elements of the power structure.  In addition, Foucault's theory of the role discipline and punishment plays in power relations provides a framework for understanding the remarkably positive outcome of the zoo animals' incarceration.<br /><br />Foucault posits that one of the underpinnings of modern Western culture is the \\"carceral society,\\" in which the technologies of punishment (and of incarceration, more specifically) extend to society at large.  He refers to incarceration itself as the discipline blockade, and posits that of the technologies that originate within this blockade and radiate into public life,  constant surveillance is the most powerful deterrent to violating societal norms.  He uses the image of the Panopticon--Jeremy Bentham's design for the ultimate prison, in which cells are arranged around a central guard station that has visual access to every inmate at all times--as a metaphor for how institutionalized power controls society through surveillance, or even just the threat of it.<br /><br />The zoo in Good Night Gorilla is both a discipline blockade and a literal iteration of the Panopticon, as all of the animals are simultaneously caged and exposed to the gaze of the authorities and the visitors.  And thanks to the subversive Gorilla, the inmates are able to escape the discipline blockade.  So why don't the animals maul the zookeeper and flee for the forest?  It is both because of the figurative Panopticon, whose presence they have come to accept as ubiquitous and inescapable, and due to their comfort within the power structure.  They have no ill will toward Joe--in fact, they long only to be closer to him by sleeping in and around his bed.<br /><br />And what of the incorrigible Gorilla, who, with his tiny accomplice the mouse (who travels freely between the zoo and society, and yet is an outsider in both places) repeats his crime even after the zookeeper has returned all the animals to their cages following the first escape attempt?  Foucault posits that recidivism does not indicate a failure of the penal system, but rather allows for the construction of a \\"criminal psychology\\" which supports the need for constant surveillance.  Had Gorilla stayed in his cage after the first incident, there would appear to be no need for the technologies of his incarceration extending beyond the walls of the zoo.<br /><br />Similarly, a child who is becoming more independent may experience a gradual dissolution of the discipline blockade (switching from a crib to a bed, for example), but will always feel the effects of panopticism, whether in the form of parental scrutiny, electronic monitors, school, work, marriage, or virtually any other institution he or she interacts with.  And the child's recidivism, even if the crime is nothing more than trying to climb in bed with his or her parents, only proves that surveillance is necessary, since a child's instincts for mayhem, like an animal's, constitute a criminal psychology that must be tempered with discipline.for constant surveillance.

B002ZG9846|5.0|When I first heard of Kick-Ass, I thought it would be some stupid comic book movie spin off. I was very wrong. The movie is very enjoyable from start to finish. It's about a boy that dresses up as a super hero and goes around doing good deeds (such as finding lost cats) in a city of crime. He ends up getting caught up in something that is much bigger than him, getting framed by a father/daughter superhero gang for killing some mob members. It's a good story about growing into who you are, getting the girl.. Oh and there's a lot of killing. The movie is clever, funny, has some heartwarming moments, and is full of action. I know this is a short, and mostly info-less review, but the movie is awesome. I don't know how much extras the Blu-Ray version has, but I'm reviewing my movie, not the extra content. Definitely a purchase.    BTW, this is the first movie with Nicolas Cage since Gone in 60 Seconds that I actually like him.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|After purchasing the Avatar blu-ray/standard dvd set, I will never buy another blu-ray until the studios get their act together vis-a-vis formats. The Avatar blu-ray can't play on any of my blu-ray players because the format is not compatible! So now we have different formats of the blu-ray format! How convoluted will this format become!  It was an expensive lesson to learn. If not for the included standard version, I would not have been able to view this film at all. Thank you very little, F___ you very much - to all who were responsible for this marketing disaster!
081297381X|3.0|Really doubting if I should keep slogging through \\"The Black Swan\\" after the author Nassim Taleb trashes Wittgenstein (and looking at the index has nothing good to say about him) then goes on to praise those who recognize the limitations of their knowledge and seems to rail against reliance on platonic ideals. Um, I don't know much philosophy or that much about Wittgenstein's theories but if Taleb is going to take shots at the person who clearly he is partially revisiting the ideas of I kinda doubt if I should bother with the rest of the 400 pages. Can he not connect the dots between anti Platonism and recognizing the limitations of language to represent reality? Kinda suggests the same self delusion he rails against.
030726999X|5.0|This is supposedly the final volume of Stieg Larsson's remarkable trilogy of Swedish detective stories. It has been reported, in connection with the on-going dispute between Larsson's father and brother and his longtime companion over ownership of the enormous royalities stemming from the books' publication, that the companion claims to have possession of a laptop with most of a fourth novel. Fans of the series can only hope that this rumor is true as readings these books is a real experience. This volume is both similar to but also different from the preceding two installments. One difference is that Larsson starts off with a high level of excitement rather than his more usual pattern of taking several hundred pages to set the stage.  This undoubtedly is due to the fact that the second volume, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" just left the reader at the ultimate point of emotion and curiosity as to the fate of Lisbeth Salander. It is also different in that there are patches of intense \\"page turning\\" excitement, but interspersed are some less than fascinating subplots which struck me a bit like padding.  Whatever their motivation, like the earlier volumes, with all these Swedish names and characters, it is sometimes difficult to keep everybody straight.<br /><br />One new feasture is that the reader learns a bit about Swedish criminal trial procedure which (as a lawyer) struck me as surprising to say the least.  The a cross-examining lawyer can ask questions of his co-counsel as a witness in the midst of his cross-examination, and pop up documents and tapes which the other side has not seen beforehand, a stark depature from our procedure. Moreover, everyone sits around a table and the procedure is rather informal--an interesting idea. We continue to learn more about computer hacking and the weakness of defensive security devices, which causes one's hair to stand on edge.<br /><br />Most importantly, Larsson fills out even further the dimensions of his most remarkable fictional creation, the character Lisbeth Salander.  She has become the central character in this continuing drama, which began in the second volume and continues here. Simply put, she is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever encountered in any fiction. Perhaps anti-hero is the best characterization for her; yet strangely the reader really comes to care about her although if she really existed, I am sure she would not not be the girl to take home to meet mother.<br /><br />The last two pages of the novel, as did the second volume, leave us hanging with curiosity.  They lead me to believe the rumors that a fourth installment to follow was Larsson's intention.  Whether we shall ever see it if it in fact does exist, remains an open question.

It is always better to watch a movie in its Original aspect ratio the way the Director intended.

Gould's Bach, as exciting as it is, has nothing to do really with Bach, but rather the composer Gould wanted to be but didin't have the talent to be.  Nothing wrong with it, and once again it's one's taste, but for me this hits the spot. I have it on vinyl.

B002RKRTGO|4.0|Hound of the Baskervilles is among the best times with the character of Sherlock Holmes, because it is one of the longest! :)  The novel length gives time to get into the mystery without it wrapping up too soon.  This allows the suspense to build and some more personal details about the key characters.  The ending is not terrific, but it fits in the classic who-done-it of the genre.  Doyle has written better in some of his short stories, but this has some unique features, including Watson getting to be at the center of things and mysterious sightings on the moor.  It's one that always seemed to be on the high school summer reading lists, and it is enjoyable in that kind of reading: light, not to be taken too seriously, a fun ride.  Worth the read.

Its hard to believe the grueling hardship that everyone goes through to see to it that her concerts are successful.

0689878451|5.0|I actually used this book for a Children's Literature course I am taking this summer and absolutely loved the illustrations. After posting my analysis on a discussion forum for an assignment; it was generally bashed and scoffed at by some seriously fanatical students. After being told everything from \\"this book is revolting\\" to \\"you're going to Hell\\", I refused to take down my post.<br /><br />I think all these people who hate this book need a reality check. We are talking about PENGUINS. Not humans, PENGUINS. I guess its all the penguins' fault for not having the good sense to read the Bible and think, \\"Right. Well, I guess I better not raise a baby with the same sex, or else I'm going to Hell!\\" This is just a testiment to the fact that humans thrive on judging and enforcing their belief systems on others who are not like them- including animals and nature itself.<br /><br />There are more than 1500 species in the world who exibit homosexual behaviour, including humans. Unfortunately nature is beyond organized religion. I read here that a woman would not read this book to her children because she found it to be \\"disgusting\\" and it would confuse them. The lack of humanity here is saddening indeed.
0142000671|5.0|One of the most incredible things that I have found reading Steinbeck is his ability to manipulate my mind set and opinions of his characters. I found this most relevant in OF MICE AND MEN.     Though I had nothing in common with either of the main characters, in no time I started to relate to them through their emotions of lonliness and that desperation to find an ideal to cling to and look forward to. Taking the journey with them to the farm and interacting with the other people helping, Steinbeck tells a beautifully written story through dialogue. This story has detailed, but limited descriptions of settings. I for one really enjoyed this aspect after reading GRAPES OF WRATH which has both vivid descriptions and dialogue.    Through the book, the reader witnesses Lennie constantly being lectured for every action he makes but still stays loyal and warm to George. This story actually reminded me of an abusive relationship when I first started reading it. George, being the abuser, is extremely negative, and verbally abusive to Lennie. Yet, the reader can feel how much love he has for Lennie as well. At first I hated George. He reminded me of Mo from the Three Stooges. I hated seeing him be so controlling and unkind to Lennie. As the story unfolded though I warmed up to George until the last pages where I went through a stage of shock, and then anger, and then pity for George. To bring all those emotions out of someone within about fifteen pages I was fully impressed.     I only wish I would've gotten the opportunity to read this in school instead of reading it on my own so I could compare perspectives and opinions on the book.

0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris reminds me of two other American essayists who wrote with sly, self-deprecating humor: Robert Benchley and James Thurber. But Sedaris has a way of engaging a wide range of human emotions: disgust at the parasite boring out of one's skin, nostalgia for a past before one's own time, embarrassment at the truck driver's indecent proposal, stoicism in the struggle to quit smoking, etc.<br /><br />Sedaris has a talent for making us laugh at him and through him at the larger absurdity of modern life. He's very matter of fact about being gay and being gay in a monogamous relationship. Like Benchley and Thurber, he indulges in \\"married\\" jokes. If he's a little bent, I think that's necessary for his form of mind-bending humor.<br /><br />It's good to bend your mind a little. Otherwise it becomes inflexible.<br /><br />I bought the book because I had heard Sedaris reading one of his essays on NPR. Some might think that the only thing better than reading it is listening to the author read it aloud. I'm not sure. Some of the subject matter seems too private. I liked being able to pick up the book and put it down. Like a determined seducer, Sedaris made me laugh every time. I think I'm in love with Hugh, too.
B0037W68F4|5.0|This is a great band that's finally showing their colors as they evolve from a clever pop act into world class artists.    This Album is miles ahead of Oracular. It doesn't grab you by the neck and hook you the way the first album does, rather, it takes a subtler approach and proves it can take the long haul of multiple listens without getting boring.     It is a LASTING album which, in my opinion, is the most difficult concept for most artists to achieve.    Looking forward for the third album from these very bright young chaps!

B00275EHIM|4.0|As a fan of the video games, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time certainly looked like it followed the games pretty closely. But trailers for films based on video games had been misleading in the past and it's safe to say that while every one of those films isn't flat out terrible, they were all pretty disappointing and weren't nearly as good as their source material. At this point though, it looks like Walt Disney Pictures has released the most satisfying video game film adaptation to date.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal was certainly a pleasant surprise as street beggar turned prince character known as Dastan. He was pretty much the last person on everyone's mind to fill the wall running shoes of the prince in this film, but he managed to get into the shape of his career, film some incredible action sequences, and be witty and charming at the same time. Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina have great supporting roles, as well. Sheik Amar (Molina) shines because of his character's underhandedness and Nizam (Kingsley) has a smarminess to him that truly shines when his plans begin to crumble. Gemma Arterton was the only one who didn't really seem to deliver. Other than her role being rather similar to her role in Clash of the Titans, she's dull and generally shows no emotion at all the majority of the time other than looking like she'll burst into tears at any given moment.<br /><br />The film was certainly able to accomplish capturing the look and feel of the video games. Other than the incredible locations where the film was shot getting the credit for that, the special effects deserve to be mentioned, as well. The vast cities, menacing sandstorms, and sands of time spectacles are pulled off because of the spectacular CGI and they don't disappoint. Other than a few minor instances, the special effects could arguably be the best part of the film.<br /><br />Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time delivers an extraordinarily entertaining action adventure that contains enough material from the video games to satisfy fans while including a relatively talented cast and jaw dropping special effects. This kind of action packed adventure is the best kind of film to catch in theaters.to satisfy fans while including a relatively talented cast and jaw dropping special effects.

B003EYVXSW|4.0|Splice really seemed liked it would be a sleeper hit. The sci-fi horror film has an incredible cast, it's produced by Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro, and early reviews were extremely positive. The insinuated enjoyment factor and entertainment value for the film were already expected to be fairly high considering the people involved and critical response. Let's just say the film is probably a bit more eccentric than you may be expecting.<br /><br />Right off the bat, you'll notice the similarities between Splice and Species since they both deal with a female creature that is a result of the splicing of human DNA with something inhuman. Trying to keep this creature in a contained environment cut off from the rest of the world is really only the first half of the film. The second half is pretty unfamiliar territory.<br /><br />Not many films (or any really) have been able to leave me speechless after viewing them. Splice came pretty close. The film leaves you with this inconclusive sense of indecisiveness. The story piques your interest and is able to hold onto it throughout the duration of the film while the main cast gives nothing but strong performances, but the film's content in the latter half is what will make or break your opinion of it. Obviously I'm trying to avoid spoilers, but let's just say you'll never look at Adrien Brody the same way again after seeing him in this.<br /><br />Splice's strongest assets are the the fact that it's fairly unpredictable and incredibly intriguing. Once it takes that left turn at Albuquerque, its ending is a bit predictable (and open-ended). The human interaction with the CG version of Dren when she first hatches is pretty impressive though. You may be able to tell that baby Dren is CG, but the performances from Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley make it believable. Be sure to see this in the theater, as well. The reaction this film gets from a packed movie theater audience is priceless. As a last word of advice, don't expect a bloodbath. There's one bloody scene in the whole film. The rest is pretty tame when it comes to gore. Whether you like it or hate it, most can probably agree that Splice is the most unusual horror film of 2010.odbath.

B003NFM3JK|1.0|I can say without reservation that this is the worst version the Carol that I have ever seen.  I am somewhat of an aficionado of the Carol so I really looked forward to Disney's release.  I went to the first showing of the first day of release (November 6,2009)and settled down to enjoy myself.  I had really hoped that Robert Zemeckis would work his magic but, unfortunately, like most adapters of the Carol he felt the need to \\"improve\\" it.  What he ended up doing was somehow removing most of the warmth and humanity from Dickens' well-loved story.  I will admit that Mr. Zemeckis uses much of the original dialogue from the book throughout this movie but most of the action is heavily modified or totally new, and is, to anyone who is familiar with the book, intrusive and irritating.  For example, in the book the door knocker changes into Marley's face and then disappears.  Here it not only appears but also screams in Scrooge's face causing him to fall down the front steps.  When Marley enters the room he doesn't just enter the room, he throws several of the heavy boxes he is chained to through the door first.   When the ghost of Christmas Past appears he looks like a candle and his head is, in fact, a candle flame floating above his body.  At the end of this session Scrooge jams the candle-snuffer over the ghost's head just as in the book.  Unlike the book he holds on to the snuffer and it suddenly blasts off like a rocket taking him high into the sky, then disintegrating and leaving him flying.  He sails past the face of the moon in a scene reminiscent of E.T.s famous scene then falls seemingly miles toward the ground before waking up on the floor beside his bed.  The whole segment is gratuitous and, quite frankly, childish.  When the Ghost of Christmas Present appears the ceiling in Scrooge's room is suddenly about 50 feet high.  The Ghost looks exactly like Jim Carrey with the beard and his expressions are the same smirking expressions that Carrey usually displays making the Ghost, at least to me, very unpleasant.  One of the things that made this segment so important in the book was that the Ghost took Scrooge around London and let him mingle with the people (albeit invisibly) to get a feel of the holiday spirit.  Here, the Ghost apparently lifts the upper story from Scrooge's house and they fly around the city in it.  Part of the floor becomes transparent and Scrooge observes everything as if on a television screen.  Yes, he sees what's going on but, he does not mingle and there is no feeling of his gaining humanity.  At the end of this segment the Ghost says that he only lives for one season and abruptly ages, dies (while still laughing Ho, Ho, Ho) rots and turns into a skeleton, then disintegrates into dust and blows away.  The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come segment is, quite frankly, very frightening.  Unlike most versions of the Carol the Ghost is mostly shown only in the shadow and becomes solid only rarely.  There is a long segment which I found to be not only frightening to a younger child but totally outside the spirit of the book, gratuitous, and frankly stupid.  The Phantom Hearse, mentioned only briefly in the book, chases a terrified Scrooge for what seems like miles.  For some unexplained reason Scrooge suddenly shrinks until he is smaller than a mouse, he slides along a rooftop smashing into icicles, then falls off the roof and lands in the bag of the charwoman, Mrs. Dilber, who is taking Scrooge's belongings to sell.  Scrooge witnesses her total lack of feeling for him and is aghast at how easily she stole things from him, still not realizing that in this future he is dead.  In the graveyard scene Scrooge, who is now again full size, is understandably terrified and, as in several other versions, he falls into his own open grave and he, and the audience, realizes that it ends in Hell.  He is, of course, saved and reformed in the end but the feeling is not that he was reformed so much because of what he learned asthat he is frightened into it.  Throughout the movie Scrooge is thrown, launched, battered and generally physically abused for no apparent purpose and with no apparent damage.  The ghosts, up to and including Marley, do not seem to be the friendly, helpful and caring spirits of the book but seem, instead, to be enjoying making Scrooge suffer rather than helping him to learn.  Overall I found the movie to be cold, depressing and one of the least satisfying versions of A Christmas Carol that I have ever seen.  I own more than 20 different versions of this story on tape and DVD.  This version will NOT be part of my collection.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Having been a fan of Devo since their debut in 1978, I was completely and utterly surprised by this new CD.  For a band to put out 5 consecutive albums in 5 years ('78 Q. Are We Not Men, A: We are Devo, '79 Duty Now For The Future, '80 Freedom of Choice, '81 New Traditionalists and '82 Oh No It' Devo) is almost unheard of these days.  Granted, since then Devo has only managed to put out 3 other releases (Shout, Total Devo, and Smooth Noodle Maps) so it was nice that they're back with Warner Brothers with Something For Everybody!    The best tracks on the cd are \\"Fresh\\", \\"Don't Shoot, I'm A Man\\", \\"Sumthin\\", \\"Later Is Now\\" and \\"March On\\".  Especially in the later tracks mentioned, it seems as though Devo has stepped up the sound a bit into the 21st century with great backbeats and guitar work.  This is typical Devo, maybe at it's best, and good enough to reintroduce them to a new generation.    \\"Later Is Now\\" should be remixed as a dance version (HINT HINT DEVO) as I think it would be a huge dance club hit.    The song study was a brilliant idea (fans chose the 12 of 16 tracks available) and gave \\"Something For Everybody\\" some buzz.  Finally a band that is letting their fans pick the songs?  Brilliant.  As is Mothersbaugh and company, sounding fresh and pumped up as ever.      The only mess, err I mean miss on the CD is \\"Cameo\\".  Other than that, you've got a pretty great solid Devo record.  A new generation of Spuds will be born.    Grade: A-  Genre: Electronic  Former songs already popular: Don't Shoot I'm A Man (has video also)  Predicted Singles:  Fresh, Later Is Now, Sumthin'   It would be nice for Devo to put together a video or two from this release.      I also see Devo getting a Grammy Nomination for Best Electronic Album next year.

1563898586|3.0|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume 1, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin O'Neill, collects the six-issue run of the original League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series first published in 1999 and 2000. In 1898, in an alternate, technologically-advanced England where all the characters of Victorian literature exist, a team made up of Wilhelmina Murray, Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jekyll, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo works to save England from domestic and foreign threats.<br /><br />There's precious little story here; we don't even get the group's over-arching objective until a third of the way through the book. Moore has to do quite a lot of world and character building, and he does a good job of it, but beyond that, things too often get bogged down as the protagonists are given to near-constant bickering.<br /><br />While I expect better storytelling from Moore, he definitely has ambience going for him. He's obviously having a great time writing in a quasi-Victorian style, and his tongue is firmly in his cheek throughout. It's the attention to detail, all the little period references, that make Moore's world as interesting (or more so) as his characters and their adventures.<br /><br />O'Neill's art, which features exaggerated, jagged figures, is generally satisfactory, although certain panels look rushed or just amateurish (his Hyde, in particular, never looks right). Background detail isn't always what it could be, although O'Neill never skimps on the money pages. And he seems to enjoy himself best when illustrating the book's many gory dismemberment scenes.<br /><br />This volume also includes Moore's Quatermain short story \\"Allan and the Sundered Veil,\\" a literary mash-up written in the style of the penny dreadful. It is not particularly interesting, and its flaws, coupled with the flaws of the comic itself, give me doubts about the viability of the premise. A world where any literary character can show up at any time (and usually does), where the most broad-strokes science fiction elements of the day are present - this is a world that's hard to take seriously, in spite of Moore's solid attempts to ground it.<br /><br />So The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume 1 turns out to be fairly underwhelming. The question of whether this is primarily due to Moore's writing or to the premise should be answered by the second volume.science fiction elements of the day are present - this is a world that's hard to take seriously, in spite of Moore's solid attempts to ground it.

B00275EHJG|5.0|First let me say: Toy Story 3 is another Pixar masterpiece and the perfect way to close a franchise started in 1995. Randy Newman's \\"You've got a friend in me\\" warms the heart today as it first did 15 years ago.<br /><br />Now with that out of the way let me call attention to the films lead-in...<br /><br /> Pixar continues another tradition here with is the animated short that precedes the feature (like Luxo Jr. where the Studio's logo comes from). Toy Story 3's short is called \\"Day & Night\\" and raises the bar for future Pixar shorts and will likely get many Academy nomination for it's efforts.  I think the 3-D may work more effectively with the short than the sequel itself. \\"Day & Night\\" is more complicated a concept than you'd expect considering it involves two mute characters struggling to coexist. One character consists, literally of daytime images while his counterpart is made of night images.  Although the two characters are little more than retro-cartoon silhouettes, they are filled with complex animated scenes within their own animation. They shift positions and move around one another creating some fascinating visuals for us. Equally simple is it's message for  folks to overcome their fear of the  differences in others and the unknown. Day & Night is simply the best short I've seen from Pixar to date<br /><br />Now with that out of the way, Toy Story 3 reunites us with old friends: Woody, Buzz, Jesse, Hamm, Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, each voiced by their original actors (except the late Jim Varney). Surprisingly, the Toys owner Andy, now grown up and ready to start college is still voiced by the same actor John Morris (who started at around 11 in the first film).  It seems the concept of toys coming to life when people aren't look would become tired after 2 films, but I have to say that is not the case here. After a super opening sequence, an homage to Woody's opening adventure in the original film, the toys end up at Daycare run like a prison by a naughty Teddy Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). Naturally the Toys want to escape; the break-out plan doesn't go quite as planned by makes for some funny tributes to the prison movie genre (including a harmonica playin' Hamm). More classic toys turn up like the old Fisher-Price rolling phone and cymbal-monkey as an ever watchful prison guard. Barbie's Ken even turns up voiced gloriously campy by Michael Keaton, definitely emerging as the film's breakout toy characterization. The visuals are more amazing than ever, the humans look so much better than the original, it may become difficult to watch those older sequences after seeing \\"3.\\"  Lot's of details sweep across the screen with everything from the Pizza Planet \\" Yo\\" truck, to all the texture of Ken's extensively stocked accessory  collection (Groovy).  But technical strides aside, on an emotional level the movie, like those before it, generate plenty of concern for the wellbeing of these CGI toys, again.

Naturally the Toys want to escape; the break-out plan doesn't go quite as planned by makes for some funny tributes to the prison movie genre (including a harmonica playin' Hamm). More classic toys turn up like the old Fisher-Price rolling phone and cymbal-monkey as an ever watchful prison guard. Barbie's Ken even turns up voiced gloriously campy by Michael Keaton, definitely emerging as the film's breakout toy characterization. The visuals are more amazing than ever, the humans look so much better than the original, it may become difficult to watch those older sequences after seeing \\"3.\\"  Lot's of details sweep across the screen with everything from the Pizza Planet \\" Yo\\" truck, to all the texture of Ken's extensively stocked accessory  collection (Groovy).  But technical strides aside, on an emotional level the movie, like those before it, generate plenty of concern for the wellbeing of these CGI toys, again. I would go as far to say if you are not touched by the final moments of the film and Andy's goodbye, then you may want to get to a cardiologist and get yourself checked out!
B000ZFI1GK|4.0|You really can't say anything bad about the Eagles.  They are an extremely talented bunch of guys who are still turning out good songs.  I didn't love everything on the album, but I love a couple of their songs on this one.
0545123275|5.0|I was never really a book reader till i read the twilight series and I read them as they came out. I though they were the best books ever but I did have my appointment in them. I just finished shiver today and let me tell you I was not disappointed once threw out that whole book and read it in about a week. The ending was the best. The last 100 pages took you for a huge twist and it literary gets fixed in the last 2 pages of the book and leaves you not being able to wait for the sequel.

B003KRJNBW|1.0|I guess I should have deduced from the title that this was a religious movie, but I didn't, so this review is for those who do not wish to watch a strictly Christian film. The lighting, the cinematography were great, but it really stopped there for me. Take out the Christian thread, and this movie has been made over and over and over again. Denzel Washington is good, but the plot and the dialogue were so heavy handed, the overall effect was insulting. As well, the idea that this man can kill others in the name of defending religion (a book nonetheless) is a little disturbing, but certainly not new.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie for those who'd like to see a playstation version of Christianity. Otherwise, don't waste your time.
1400067936|5.0|On the one hand, the book does not offer any ideas beyond what was said by Kuhn, Lakatos, Popper, Hume, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffet. So, unfortunatelty, it hasn't really changed the way I think about life and business as I have been exposed to the ideas of the aforementioned thinkers on my own. On the other hand, the book puts those ideas to practice in a very understandable and exciting manner. So the book did give me some well-verbalized formulations of things I had a light, intuitive feel for, but couldn't quite formulate.
1405052295|3.0|Love the story and the story narrator is terrific, sound effects and music add a lot to the reading as well.  But be aware that this audiobook CD does not include page turn signals, so if you want to use it in a listening center it may not work well.
B003ELOQD4|3.0|The first time I watched it I was struck by how it didn't seem like an HD quality production. A lot of the wide angle shots look great, but the up close shots of the band leave something to be desired. And then I watched the bonus features. The documentary included looks great! I'm not sure what it is that left the concert looking worse - perhaps the style of the director? Whatever the cause, an otherwise great concert was left a little unsatisfying - simply because it did not live up to the blu-ray possibilities.    However, everything else is wonderful. Great sound. Enjoyable set list. And, in spite of disappointing video, a great addition to the U2 video collection, especially for those who were fortunate enough to see this tour live.

B002ZG997C|4.0|I've seen this twice. This is a solid flick that's entertaining, yet it has a subtle message. Those who enjoy post apocalyptic sci-fi, as well as those who like a deeper message will enjoy this. The movie has its very exciting, action-flick moments, but there's a kind of depth to it also. Those who are open to the spiritual component of this film will be moved. Yet it's done in such a way that those who aren't into it probably won't be bothered by it.<br /><br />During the second viewing I was able to pick up a lot of the subtleties of the film. They did a great job at creating this \\"world\\", and I found myself drawn into it. The acting was also top notch.<br /><br />The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I found parts of it to be kind of slow. In comparison with other movies that I've given 5 stars to, the story was just not quite as riveting. Still, it was really good and worth viewing.<br /><br />It's rated R because there's some violence in this film, and though some of it's kind of shocking at times, it's not very explicit. There are also a couple of rape scenes where you see the initial violence, but not the act.
B0035J6TAI|3.0|I could listen to Peter Gabriel sing the phone book. That's how much I like his voice. But this album is on the slow side. Some might even call it a snoozer. All the tracks are pretty laid back - no dance material here. PG is still in fine voice and does interesting interpretations of these songs. Yet, this album makes me yearn for the days of SO, when the songs had more bite and energy. PG is an acquired taste and this one takes some getting used to.
0767817478|3.0|As many g fans  before me have stated this movie is not Godzilla, this is GINO (Godzilla In Name Only). To be honest I Loved this movie when I was young. This movie actually made me like Godzilla in the first place, I never knew about him until i watched this when I was 5. Yes this Godzilla movie started it all for me. I started researching more about Goji on the internet and found out all these other movies. I then realized this is not a Godzilla movie, just a rip off. Once I watche d the japanese my loving of this movie went down quickly. But still it's not that bad. Let me explain it in simple terms.  Pros: Great Humour  Great Effects  Not a bad story  Epic Music when chasing Godzilla  Epic Lines by the actors: \\"I want you to blow up Madison Square Garden\\"    Cons: Godzilla running away  Not using Godzilla's original design, origins or his fire breath  Kind of ridiculous with the baby raptor Godzilla but that's not a bad con    Well there you have it, an ok Godzilla movie. But I have to admit it has the best starts of any godzilla movie. Showing the atomic bomb was really cool and then the Japanese boat attack is great too.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|This is possibly the WORST sequel i have ever seen in my life. I LOVED the 1st one so much i actually gave the DVD as gifts to several people. This \\"all saints day\\" mess plays like someone else wrote a \\"parody\\" sequel. I really had hopes for it. Troy Duffy is a giant ego maniacal tool bag who got lucky with the 1st one, this one totally fell short.
B000286RNY|5.0|Oh man this movie is funny. This is Stephen Chows BEST movie. The humour is hilarious with no need for swearing. The singing scene made me laugh over and over. I have watched this with all my mates and everyone of us is laughing on the ground. Truly a classic. It is a must watch for people with a funny bone. I don't know how people can rate this the worst movie, because if they did they should get out from under their rock.
1453605738|5.0|Pride and Prejudice, Jane's most well known work and for good reason. This book is a must read classic. It is a light hearted  humorous novel that tells the story of how two people, Mr. Darcy, a conceited man of a much wealth, and Elizabeth Bennet whose family has no wealth to brag of and insignificant connections, fall in love once they each cast their prejudices and pride. This book overall was very much enjoyable from my standpoint.
B0024RID6U|3.0|They say that Tattoo You was made up of leftovers.  I think it contains some of the Stones best work in years, but it doesn't really work for me as an album.  Most of the tracks fall into one of two categories:  Hang Fire, Neighbors, Little T & A, and Start Me Up are stripped down, full blast rockers, sung in Mick's growl (except for Little T & A, sung in whatever you want to call Keith's voice).       Slave, Worried About You, Tops, Heaven, and No Use In Crying are the funky/soul/discoish Stones of Emotional Rescue and Miss You, with a lot of falsetto. I guess it's just a matter of taste, but personally, I can't stomach these.       Black Limousine is a good bluesy rocker that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Beggar's Banquet.       Finally, there's Waiting On A Friend, one of their better ballads, with Mick getting in touch with his sensitive side, and some nice sax from Sonny Rollins.       All in all, I feel like this cd was worth the modest price I paid for it--I selected the cuts I like and combined them with the better tracks from Steel Wheels, resulting in a **** cd
1577314808|5.0|THE POWER OF NOW remains the best book I've ever read in my life. I've been slowly working through it for the last ten years and will continue reading it and reflecting upon it for the rest of my life.

006145205X|4.0|Great book on how civilizations have prospered and evolved to better humanity and industrialized as a whole. Sure bad things will happen but humans have evolved a brain big enough to over come diversity and are able to shape the environment to better our needs. As long as we better our crops through GM modification and triple our yield we can feed and prosper as a society as a whole. Matt Ridley does a fine job of explaining the facts and how we as humans have evolved and prospered and will continue to do so.
076532413X|2.0|I checked out this book because I was a fan of the TV series, but I ended up unsatisfied. It may be worth a read for people who go through tons of sci-fi novels, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend the book to all fans of the series. The story is still intriguing (and quite different), but the experience of reading the book was too frustrating to be worth it.    Others may not take issue with this, but the self-conscious writing style constantly distracted me from the flow of the story. Rather than hooking the reader right away, the book starts with a highly detailed description of the facility the story takes place in, and it later includes other odd tangents like a four-page description of a computer slideshow presentation. The similarity of the different characters' dialogue stood out for me, as if everyone used the author's voice, which I found especially jarring with female characters and those who were supposedly non-native speakers of English. The many scientific discussions (both between characters and within the narration) may add welcome background information for some readers, but to me they felt like pockets of nonfiction inserted unnecessarily into the story. Less importantly, there were also quite a few typos.    But I did enjoy the story, and it was interesting to note the changes that were made in the TV series. Also, the author's predictions for 2009 and 2030 were entertaining--sometimes laughable, sometimes thought-provoking--and I'm sure writing about the future is harder than it looks.
B000Y1CWDS|5.0|This 3 disc edition of Spider-Man 3 is awesome can't get anny better than this. Spider-man 3 rocks. The Villians in this movie are awesome.

0525423842|1.0|I agree, the book abruptly ends and I felt I was robbed of at least a slightly entertaining read.  At the slow rate this book was written, I won't be surprised if it takes 3-4 more books to get to the point of the story and an ending.  I love Mr. Grisham's books, but this book was extremely disappointing.  I like continuing sagas, but feel each individual book should be exciting and conclude even though the character may continue.

B003HARV7A|4.0|[[ASIN:B003HARV7A Showgirls (15th Anniversary Sinsational Edition) [Blu-ray]]]Blu-Ray has the same content as the previously released DVD of Showgirls in the V.I.P. box set or FULLY EXPOSED edition. Same dishy drama professor queen commentary track by David Schmader of Seattle, same text in the Pop Up Trivia Track. But, the transfer is re-done in Hi Def 1080p  BluRay. The Graphics are updated for the Pop Up Trivia Track, and the disc menu is the cutest animation with important memorable lines from the timelessly awful screenplay memorialized (It's from Ver-Sayce) in the menu's animated slot machine. The transfer is state of the art, cleaned up and restored, with no trace of dirt or scratches that sometimes come with a 1994 film. From the start you can see every excruciating detail. Whether it's Nomi's earrings, details of the now gone Las Vegas hotels like the Hacienda and the Stardust. You may have to adjust your set for the over-saturated over the top color. The disc can't be faulted for great detail and clarity  in this HD transfer of the cult status film. One thing about the audio, the only full surround track is in DTS. The Dolby tracks are only in 2 channel, English, French, Spanish, or catty commentary track. So, for the full effect, make sure your surround system can decode DTS HD Master Audio. Otherwise, no discrete surround, only 2 channel mixed for Dolby Pro Logic. This is not the case in previous DVD releases which had Dolby 5.1 surround tracks.   Las Vegas has changed a lot since 1994, and you can see the lost Vegas in the exterior scenes on The Strip and outside the Stardust like you are back in the day. The transfer looks great, a must have for SHOWGIRLS fans that have a Blu-Ray and DTS Surround home theater to re-live the wonderful awfulness of this cult classic, in new found sparkling detail.    ADDENDUM - On reviewing the \\"Extras\\" I notice that they include \\"Pole Dancing - Finding your Inner Stripper\\" is   a tutorial by a former ballerina that nowteaches Pole Dancing. Terry Jaworski of \\"S Factor\\", [...] her dance and exercise school.  Even though the end credits for this 12 minute featurette  have the 1995 release date for the main \\"Showgirls\\" feature, it appears that \\"Pole Dancing - Finding your inner Stripper\\" may have been produced for the 2010 release of the Blu-Ray with a 2010 date at the end. Terry spells out the specifics on all the moves in pole dancing, which in the video she calls \\"swing walk\\", \\"firefly\\", \\"Corkscrew\\", \\"Snake\\", \\"the Dive\\", \\"Pole Cat\\", \\"Helicopter\\", \\"Climb\\", \\"Layout\\", and the \\"Descending Angel\\".
B000E41MS6|5.0|I was a huge fan of the old Doctor Who. For years I was an obsessive viewer of the series on WTTW, the local PBS station here in Chicago, coming the love the show through Tom<br />Baker's Fourth Doctor.  Over the years they showed all the rest of John Pertwee's Third Doctor, as well as all of Tom Baker's successors.  I loved the hokey nature of the show, the silly special effects, the long array of creepy villains, and the various weird worlds that they explored.  But for some reason when Russell T. Davies relit the series in 2005, I deliberately avoided it.  I've talked to others who were fans of the old series, and many of them have also avoided seeing the new shows.  I really can't say why I avoided watching the show, but eventually I realized that it was the only SF series of the past decade that I hadn't seen, along with its spin off TORCHWOOD.<br /><br />So for some reason I decided to give the new series a try.  Each year after the regular TV season has ended, I always try to watch several TV series that I had previously missed.  My first show this summer was DEADWOOD (loved it!) and my next project was to watch all of DOCTOR WHO and TORCHWOOD.  And I've really loved them!<br /><br />I instantly loved the combo of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper as the Doctor and Rose Tyler.  I have only one complaint about Season One and that is that it was the only one that Eccleson did.  I really came to love David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, but I wish that Eccleston had done an additional season or two.  Viewing Season One of the new Doctor Who in contrast with all of the other seasons, there is no question that it represented a massive improvement in the sereis in virtually every way.  There was an absolutely stunning improvement in special effects.  The sets were vastly better and the series engaged in far more location shooting than before.  The show was better acted, better written, better designed, and better photographed.  But as good as Eccleston was as the Doctor, I think the writing sharpened in future seasons.  Season One had no individual episodes as spectacular as the episodes of later seasons such as \\"Blink\\" and \\"Midnight.\\"<br /><br />But if you are like me, a fan of the old Doctor Who who has been avoiding the new series, I encourage you to give this new one a try.  I've enjoyed the first four seasons enormously (I'm now watching the Matt Smith episodes and have to confess that I'm not loving them, but I'm going to give him a good try).  The show is absolutely a worthy successor to the longest running SF series in the history of TV.nk the writing sharpened in future seasons.

B002O1XIN4|4.0|If your into post hardcore, you should like this.    They arn't a \\"metalcore\\" band per say, but simply put a Post-Hardcore band in every aspect.    Asking Alexandria contributes to the new Electronics/dance/techno theme going on lately.    This means essentially that they use synth and the like to put dance parts here and there in the music. Not every song but some have little club dance parts followed by vocals over them. Its quite a neat little effect so if your a fan of this new energetic style, you'll like it. If not, this band doesn't really do it frequently so its a good way to \\"test the waters\\"    There are clean vocals on this cd, the lead vocalist does them instead of a guitarist. Some people prefer this. I'd say about 45% of every song is singing while the rest is screaming/growling. Its an even mix and its done very well so you shouldnt get sick of one or the other. If you really dont like Chorus lines that incorporate singing then this isnt for you.    Most of the chorus lines are straight singing. Usually something somewhat silly if your into lyrics.    Most of the lyrics are a little ridiculous so if your into that, READ them first I suggest. Some deal with breaking up with your girlfriend and being mad about that. Dear Mr. Brooks is about killing someone.    There are breakdowns in the music if your interested, also the synth dance parts used with the breakdowns sometimes is really neat.      The CD is slightly overproduced...the music is pretty Clean sounding. Now some people love that, some do not. I warn you now, this CD is clean sounding so be prepared if you hate that. Its not extremely overdone but it is noticeable.    Don't expect guitar solos of any kind. Also, the vocals are essentially what you get. The metal esq. scream, rarely a hardcorish yell sound and that low growl, there are no \\"bree\\" noises.    Overall its a really good CD and if your into Post Hardcore with dancey synth parts, this is a great way to start. Its got alot of catchy parts and some fun memorable notes.          I personally like this cd and on occasion it makes my rotation on mp3 players. Some songs I don't really care for, mostly due to the lyrics...but some are really catchy and enjoyable! \\"Candlelit Dinner,\\" \\"Mr. Brooks,\\" \\"cant ride two horses\\" and \\"Single whatever sincerity\\" are the ones i liked the most!      Enjoy!
B000JIHP88|5.0|My baby was early and at the Children's Hospital, they use these in the nursery. I had already bought one for his crib and it was well worth it. Baby stares at it, on and off. He loves the music, which puts him to sleep every time. Diaper changes are easier with the mobile too. The hospital recommends it, I recommend it. SUCH A GREAT BUY!
B001HN694K|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, and should be accepted for what it is.  The \\"bookends\\" do a great job of foreshadowing the story and bringing to its climax. When she was a young girl, Alice knew who she was and what was inside her.  Even at age 7, as she feared for her sanity due to her recurring nightmare, she demonstrated her awareness/consciousness of her \\"self.\\" As happens to most of us as we grow up, Alice begins to behave in a manner that suits others and is expected of her.  She loses her \\"muchness\\" - that part of her - deep inside her- that defines who she is.  This story is not about Alice's battle with the Jabberwocky; it is about her search for herself. To paraphrase:  \\"The decision is hers - when she faces the creature, she will be alone.\\" This is not a reference to the Jabberwocky; it's a pivotal insight to her future - when she makes decisions, she is the one who will live with the consequences, not the people who are expecting her to behave in accordance with their standards.<br /><br />The cast is phenomenal, the colors and imagery are amazing. The Mad Hatter's accent changes in responses to where (and when) his personality is living. To truly understand the movie, watch it with the English subtitles, and watch the bonus features - but only after you've watched it at least once just for fun.  Enjoy it; it's a delightful movie that can take you on an amazing journey.
0385341008|5.0|I very rarely rate anything I review a five-star, but this novel definitely deserves five stars, if not more.<br /><br />This is the story of Juliet Ashton, a writer in 1946 London, as told in the form of letters she sends and receives.  The letters are not only from her publisher, but also from her friends and people from Guernsey with whom she has struck up a friendship.<br /><br />From letters I have read of that time (my parents' time, I admit), and, considering the location, the voice and tone of these letters are both spot-on, especially considering the setting.  Readers must recall that Guernsey was still recovering from five years of German occupation, and the privations of the occupation affected the Guernsey people's attitudes. (After all, how would you feel if you'd had little more than potatoes and turnips to live on for five years, and had to deal with an unpredictable occupation force?) One character in the story, originally from France and rather fragile physically and emotionally from years in a prison camp, particularly highlights the difficult times.<br /><br />Even though I was required to take a year of British history when I was in graduate English classes, the era from about 1935 to 1950 is one that seems to be glossed over in history classes, and through this novel I learned about the geography of the Channel Islands area and the history of 1940's Britain.  I highly recommend this book.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|OK, so you know the song Bohemian rhapsody by queen? It is Freddy Mercury's magnum opus. Queen took the length of the song and packed everything they could think of into it. Now imagine an entire album of that and that's what you have here. It is nine songs of that kind of creativity plus one song \\"the gambler\\" that is so beautiful it breaks you down every time you hear it. Do your self a favor and get this album.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I bought this watch for my husband for Father's Day. From the moment he opened the box, he could not stop saying, \\"Wow!\\" It's very nicely made and has a good heavy weight to it. It looks more expensive than it actually is. If you're looking for a great watch at a fantastic price, don't hesitate on this one. It's well worth the purchase.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a truly beautiful book. It is filled with all the emotions you can think of. I personally never cry at sad books or movies, but after reading this one I did.I passed this book on to one of my friends and she said that she had tears streaming down her face at the end of it. This is an amazing book!  It is regarded as my favorite book ever and has a special place on my bookshelf.

B002ZG997M|5.0|Fun movie that I really enjoyed. I'm a Christian and find the anti Christian reviews here even more entertaining. Hope there is a sequel or prequel.
B002ZG997C|3.0|I really did want to like this movie, and there were aspects of it that were entertaining, but overall I found it to be a disappointment.  Denzel Washington as always was very good, but the rest of the cast came up a little short.  For the record I think Mila Kunis is absolutely gorgeous but as far as an end of the world warrior in training, I just don't see it.  Gary Oldman was just a disappointment.  I couldn't see him convincing me in this role at all.  I think he was going for a Dennis Hopper persona but there is, or was, only one Dennis Hopper.<br /><br />The movie begins with 10 minutes or so of Denzel in isolation making his way across the country.  All we really find out is he is going west, he loves his IPod and if you attempt to get in his way you will lose a body part of some sort.  He doesn't look for violence but when pressed, he will fight back with a vengeance.  Luckily there aren't many people who get in his way.  The world has been destroyed and much of the population wiped out.  It appears to be from a nuclear war but in reality the cause and effect is never completely explained.<br /><br />Denzel finds his way to a local city and at that point we discover Gary Oldman and his gang of bike riding goons, who are all looking for a book.  It is a special book and all we know is that it can be used as a weapon.  It was easy for me to read what was happening at that point, the hints were pretty blatant, but I will not give the secret away for those of you who might not pick up on what direction the movie was heading.  Denzel happens to posses the book and won't give it up.  He actually kills anyone who tries to take it, and in-between the violent melees he meets Mila Kunis.<br /><br />The second big surprise, which affects Denzel, becomes pretty evident as well.  I hate it when  movie gives too many clues.  Again, I won't give it away, but the dude can smell anything and everything within a mile of where he stands.  What kind of guy has a better sense of smell than my dog?  Pretty damn impressive.  No wonder he wasn't jumping all over Mila Kunis.  If anyone, even in a post nuclear meltdown met that woman, they would be all over her.  Denzel stays true to his calling and other than killing numerous people, he in the end delivers on his preordained mystical directive.<br /><br />I think if I was sitting in my house, survived nuclear destruction and some voice called me from the inner recesses of my brain telling me to pick a book and take it west; I would have a glass of scotch and call it a day.  That is probably why I will never be in the movies I guess.<br /><br />Overall the movie had some decent action scenes, Denzel as always was brilliant but the plot and supporting actors fell short in my opinion.  There just wasn't a lot of depth here.  Bring me back to the Mad Max days and Mel Gibson.  Now that was an awesome movie surrounding worldwide destructiontty damn impressive.

0060920084|4.0|I liked it.  Pretty funny.  Fairly harsh and quite critical of general American society.  It is very frank.  He didn't pull punches.  He called the towns as he saw them.  I spent 10 days in Europe last summer and when I came back, there were a lot of things about American society that really drove me nuts.  I can see how spending several years in England, especially if you have a rather 'liberal' ideology could lead you to making several of the comments that he did in the book.  (I'm not saying Europe is the greatest place on earth, it is just different, and some of that difference is better).  Lots of Americans are way overweight.  Lots of Americans don't walk anywhere.  In most places in America, it is damn near impossible to walk anywhere without climbing over barriers or worry about being hit by a car.    The book is basically one pot-shot after another, since he doesn't spend enough time in any one town to get to really know anyone or truly get to know anything about the town.  You have to read the book for what it is, one long road trip with the only destination being returning home.  Just long stretches of road with small towns along the way for stopping points to sleep in.  It is a light read, but not very enlightening.  Still pretty funny.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I remember when Toy Story was first released and I actually had stock in Pixar.  Sadly I sold the stock but Pixar just keeps making fantastic movies.  I admittedly went into Toy Story III with low expectations.  It is the third film in a series which usually marks the demise.  Nothing ever seems as good as the original.  Somehow Pixar avoids the clich&eacute;'s and has managed to produce a movie that adults will most likely enjoy as well as kids.  Having three daughters of my own, one who is sixteen, I can relate wholeheartedly to the story.<br /><br />Andy is seventeen and is on his way to college.  He is making the transition to adulthood which means letting your childhood go.  Along with his adolescence he is also saying goodbye to his toys.  The opening scene is a marvelous fantasy depicting all the toys in a wonderfully scenario of good guys versus bad.  Some of the toys being on the side of the law and some finding a darker route, but it is all in good fun.  As the dream sequence wraps up, we find out it is really the toys who are desperately trying to get Andy to play with them, one final time before he packs them away in the attic or sends them off to the trash heap.<br /><br />As seems to typically happen with Andy's toys, something goes amiss and they find their way to a daycare center, where they are subjected to severe beatings and destructive activity from toddlers.  Anyone who has kids can relate to the age when they beat and chewed on anything within their grasp.  The center is ran by a purple stuffed bear who had his heart broken after being forgotten one day on picnic outing.  He is a bitter angry old bear and takes his frustration out on anyone and everyone in his path.<br /><br />I loved them using the baby as the bruiser in the movie.  Seeing this big plastic headed diaper wearing baby gooooing and ahhing while picking up toys a quarter his size and shoving them in a cage was too funny.  I have to admit that Barbie and Ken stole the show in their scenes where they expressed their love, and in one sequence where Ken tried on some of his extensive wardrobe.  Some of those clothes actually did bring back memories and I laughed out loud when Ken loudly expressed he was not a girl's toy.  It seems even Ken has some gender issues.<br /><br />My favorite part of the entire movie was watching Buzz Lightyear get switched into Spanish mode and listening to him spout off his love for Jesse while reading the subtitles.  It wasn't just his verbiage but his salsa dancing as he swept Jesse off her feet doing what appeared to be a Tango.  It was too funny for words but was followed up by many other things both subtle and not so subtle that kept you laughing.  As only Pixar seems to be able to do, they told a story that was touching, funny, and all so relevant to real life.<br /><br />In the end, Andy ventures off to college and leaves behind not only his toys but his parents, his house and his past.  As all kids do, he ventured out to find himself and figure out his own life so hopefully he would way day be an adult with the rest of us.  In one of the most touching moments I have seen in any animated film ever, he hands off his precious toys one by one to a neighborhood girl who will appreciate them and play with them as he no longer can.  At his age he is moving on for his own good and letting go of the past for the happiness of the toys as well.<br /><br />While the 3D affects are ok, the movie is not ground breaking in any visual way but the story is what has always held Pixar aloft of any competitors.  They seem to have this knack for hitting a home run and with Toy Story III they have not let us down in any way.  If you have kids then use them as an excuse to see the movie.  They will enjoy it and most adults should really appreciate it as they will most likely be trying not to cry at the end.<br /><br />Don't expect any huge actions scenes, or gun play, or violent undertones.  Just expect a wholesome, clean, wonderful movie that will touch your heart and keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours.ned for a couple of hours.
0440243688|3.0|It is better than 'One Shot' which is my personal low water mark for Jack Reacher novels.  ('Echo Burning' doesn't reach the water mark, 'The Hard Way' far exceeds it.)
0062009540|5.0|I am seriously addicted to the series \\"Pretty Little Liars\\"! I saw that ABC family was starting a show called Pretty Little Liars and so I researched it  and discovered its based after a book series. Of course the books are always better than the TV so I ordered all of the books! I have not been able to put them down.  I have read the first three in the last 5 days! There are 5 friends, Hanna, Alison, Spencer, Aria, and Emily. Alison is murdered one night and the 4 remaining friends start to drift apart.   After 3 years since the unsolved murdered the girls start to get text messages from their dead friend Alison. The texts are revealing secrets that only Alison knew about the girls.   All 4 of them feel alone and paranoid. The body is found one night and at the funeral and each girl discover that she not the one getting these weird texts but all of the 4 friends are.   They get together to try to solve the mystery but they have no luck. The person sending all the text messages goes by the name of \\"A.\\" She reveals to each girl that Aria is sleeping with her  teacher and that her father is cheating on their mother and is blackmailing Aria. Emily has been kissing girls and \\"A\\" is threatening to tell everyone. Spencer is secretly stealing all her perfect older  sisters boyfriends, including the one who just moved into their house! And Hanna secret of her bulimia is above to be revealed. The book leaves the reader on the edge of their seat. I highly recommend this book.  I was however very disappointed in the show. The missed out on a lot of key characters and moments. The entire first book was squeezed into 45 minutes and did not even capture the 4 friends personalities very well.  I cannot wait to see who \\"A\\" is and who killed Alison! So excited to start the next book in the series
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story 3 has Andy's toys trying to find a new place where they belong after Andy gets ready to go away to college. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), however hasn't given up on Andy and plans on going away with him. But Woody's toy friends need his help because their stay at a daycare center isn't the paradise they thought it would be. Can Woody help them escape and make it home in time to go with Andy ?<br /><br />  The movie is a very satisfying end, for the movies that is, there's going to be a short before Cars 2 I heard. So we'll still get to see the characters that we love. But Toy Story 3 still feels like farewell and it has a very emotional ending that's bound to make you cry happy tears. Pixar has done it again because so far Toy Story 3 is the best movie that I've seen this year. Just see it, but bring tissues!
030726999X|3.0|I'd so been looking forward to the finale of the series, but it's been a major disappointment. It's in serious need of editing. I assume there would have been major revisions to the manuscript had the author not died. There are major plot points left unanswered, and it simply doesn't have the compelling drama of the first two books. Minor characters are more of a focus than the other two, and most are carelessly drawn without a lot of distinction to them. To make it worse, many of the bad guys/police seem to have very similar names that makes it very difficult to keep straight. Any other details would be a spoiler (although not a lot of spoiling to do, in my opinion!)so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I can't imagine NOT having read this, simply to find out what happens to both Salander and Blomkvist. But what a shame that the conclusion is so unsatisfying.

B0000029LI|5.0|I am a Michael-a-holic and I have a huge collection of Michael's cds. I forgot about cassette tapes as an option for more Michael music. I bought this cassette, a double cassette, planning to frame it with many of the brand new, sealed cassettes from Michael that I have started collecting. Until recently I really didn't know that cassettes of Michael's music were still available through the Invincible album in the early 2000's. But then again, this is Michael, the great innovator, so it makes perfect sense that the world's greatest artist would still have cassettes produced. It's fun to collect his cassettes, and all forms of Michael's music for that matter. After all, Michael's music spans decades from 45 rpm records, to 33 rpm, to 8 track tapes in the Jackson 5 days and his early solo career, to his cd/vcd discs up to today's cds. The moral of the story is you can never have too much Michael music. I love my copy of this cassette. It's retro, and it reminds me of the great days when cassettes were popular, especially the 1980's, when I came to know and love Michael. I am now 41 years old and I'm grateful to God that I lived so many years on this earth with Michael, but it was not enough and I miss him desperately.

I am about to put it on mute and just take in the gorgeous cinematography. The narration is painful. The 160+ 1 star reviews say it all. Americanization will evermore be synonymous with pure crap.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|When I don't have my Grado SR225i headphones plugged into a CMOY amp, the Fiio E5 is what I carry around with my Zune and some in-ear buds. It's pretty easy to use, my only complaint about it is the rechargeable battery. If I go on a long trip, I have no choice but to find a way to recharge, this just means that I have to carry along another charger instead of just buying some batteries on my trip. Oterwise, it does what it says, boosts the signal. But there is no substitute for a nice CMOY amp.

0891419063|5.0|Fantastic accounting of the war in the Pacific. Written by someone in the thick of the action and in a manner that has you not wanting to put down the book!
0470477237|1.0|First, let me make it clear that I'm not an old grumpy throwback still trying to score deals in the classifieds section of my newspaper. I have an Internet history that dates back to the 80's and I design and engineer websites and I've done plenty of work on sites that either are social media sites or take advantage of social media sites. I have a very long view of social media and how far its come and how it has disappointed.<br /><br />In the first paragraph of the introduction, Qualman writes \\"Just like social media itself, this book is written in sporadically digestible sound bites.\\" This is all you need to know about this book. If you want a brainstorm of half-proven assertions that you can mine for ideas for your next marketing campaign, you'll probably find this book valuable. If you're looking to establish understanding and a long term outlook on social media, keep looking because another way that this book is like most social media is that it will have a short shelf life.<br /><br />Socialnomics promises to reveal how social media transforms the way we live and do business, but it doesn't reveal or inform so much as it presents a lot of loose anecdotes about the power of social media and how it appears to be affecting the world. While he occasionally makes a passing mention of the downside of social media, his tone is too often an infomercial-like positivity about the sheer awesomeness of social media. A particularly cringe-worthy example is how he closes his introduction by claiming that social media will reduce redundancy and recapture billions of hours that can be redistributed toward the betterment of society.<br /><br />This is a bridge too far and if you're going to make paradigm changing predictions like this, you'd better devote some serious grey matter into backing it up. Socialnomics doesn't. It's as if every argument in the book is allocated 140 characters of reasoning before we move on to the next topic.<br /><br />Writing about disruptive technologies is a dangerous sport. Chances are that you'll be wrong about a lot of things, but the ones that have done it well like Howard Rheingold and Douglas Rushkoff were able to do it in a more profound way that caused you to evaluate how we interact with media and each other and their works continue to have value long after the judgement has come on whether they were right or wrong.<br /><br />I get the feeling that Qualman can do better and in his next book he should write a book that can't be tweeted. It might have a longer shelf life.
B001FB5634|1.0|The absurdities in this film abound. Of all the millions of guns in this country, all the Dad has is a six shot revolver with 2 rounds of ammo...   The best mode of transporting their stuff is in a shopping cart... When they finally get a new cart it has two wheels so they drag it around like some third world farmer. This is the best they can find...  The kid (some of the WORST acting I've ever seen) grew up in a post apocalyptic world.  That is his reality, he knows nothing else.  Why the heck does EVERYTHING horrify him... stop your whining!!   They are starving.  They magically find a fully stocked bomb shelter--let's leave it after just a few days... Oh, come on!   It would be a waste of time to continue this review.

B003A4IFGY|3.0|Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers step into jamming me mode and get all laid back on \\"Mojo.\\" It's so laid back that I was wondering if they should have renamed it \\"Slo-Mo,\\" but I decided to give it a few more spins. Given the chance to grow on you, \\"Mojo\\" is a pretty good groove record. It keeps a pretty even pace, and The Heartbreakers are their usual top notch playing selves. Much like 2008's \\"Mudcrutch\\" reunion/debut, \\"Mojo\\" has that 'friends gettin' together' feel about it.<br /><br />This is also the Tom Petty album that seems to owe the most to his Dylan/Dead days, also like Mudcrutch. There's more jam here than structure, which makes for some great moments, like Mike Campbell's blistering lead on \\"Good Enough\\" and the drawling \\"US 41.\\" The rocking moments, like \\"I Should Have Known It\\" and \\"First Flash Of Freedom\\" are also prime Petty.<br /><br />On the negative side, some studio jams should have been more developed. Both \\"Candy\\" and \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" are almost painfully bad. The faux reggae of \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" clones Eric Clapton's hit cover of \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" as Petty whines that he hopes the cops don't pull him over because he's smoking a joint in the car. Which might be cool if you're a 20 year old (or Willie Nelson), but just sounds silly from a near 60 millionaire. It's too easy a song for an artist of Petty's caliber.<br /><br />After the more challenging \\"The Last DJ\\" exposed Petty's indignation with the industry he's basically grown up in, the hazy smoothness of \\"Mojo\\" is Okay. Having become acclimated to many, many great Tom Petty albums, I was just surprised at just average this is.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|Beautifully judged performances by Perahia. I used to like Brendel and ASMF but now those recordings sound cumbersome and lifeless. To get the full Mozart piano concerto experience I strongly suggest you also acquire the John Eliot Gardiner and Malcolm Bilson set on DG. A different feel altogether and the piano is mixed furhter back into the mix as part of the orchestra, probably more like Mozart heard it.

B002QF31HQ|1.0|One star not only for the lack of audio quality, but for ripping me off for almost $30 for this pressing that was SUPPOSED to be better. It isn't.<br /><br />Listening to my original regular pressing (Gates of Delerium is 3/4 through) after first listening to this Friday Music pressing and the difference is very audible..... and not in a good way for Friday Music.<br /><br />This Friday Music pressing sounds compressed. It is not as full/detailed, rich, or as transparent (the sound-stage is not nearly as wide or as deep), the bass is less present. On my original the bass is very well-rounded, very clear and full, on this it is just \\"okay\\".<br /><br />VERY disappointed. I had such high hopes for this.<br />The entire idea behind remastering music is to make it sound better...... but Friday Music certainly failed here.

0307271862|5.0|Although Henning Mankell is known primarily for his crime fiction featuring Wallender and his family in Sweden, The Man from Beijing is truly an international work of fiction. And although it begins with the discovery of a savage massacre in a remote Swedish village, this is not really crime fiction.    Instead, The Man from Beijing is a story of empire-building corruption, family ties and revenge that spans China, old Europe, new America and Africa.    A wolf looking for solitary territory is the first to discover the bodies in that Swedish village. A traveling photographer is next. The police methodically try to follow procedure to solve the crime, but it's just not the kind of situation that lends itself to by-the-book thinking. And when someone who isn't thinking inside the box comes along, her ability to find clues and make connections isn't appreciated. It doesn't matter to the police that Birgitta Roslin is a judge; she is an interference.    Her discoveries mesh with what the reader knows as the story turns to that of San. The young Chinese man  begins by losing his parents and is forced to work on the railroad in the American West of the 1860s. His cruel overseer is a distant relative of descendants who will eventually be foster parents to Birgitta's mother, and the boss's diary reveals another side of the story. The reader also meets Ya Ru, a modern Chinese financier with ties to the ruling politburo and big plans rooted in the cruelties of the railroad gangs.    Mankell has put into place the makings of a terrific revenge story that spans more than 100 years. But that's not the full scope of his intent, and he pulls off his intentions brilliantly. What he chronicles in this tale of two families, subordination and revenge is the rise and fall of empires, of how the enslaved become the slaveowners and how those who once ruled will someday be the ruled. And no matter how well it is known that one's ancestors suffered, it is always possible to rationalize becoming one of the rulers, one of the colonizers, one of the empire builders.    The Man from Beijing concerns itself not only with empires, but also how an individual's philosophy can change, say, from promoting revolution to collecting wine, or how a revolutionary can appear to be the old-fashioned one. Mankell is wise enough to let his readers draw their own conclusions. He has drawn the map well for his readers and then allows them to make the journey for themselves.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|Like many others here, I've been a Devo fan for 32 years.  I received \\"Something for Everybody\\" today, and I've listened to it at least 5 times already -- for me, that's unheard of these days.  This album is fun to listen to, and it has catchy lyrics.  Personally, I'd say it's musically along the lines of \\"New Traditionalists.\\"  It doesn't really break any new musical ground for Devo, but it's fun nonetheless.  The production quality is EXCELLENT.  This album really sounds good -- both cranked on my home stereo and in my car.  I highly recommend this album -- especially for Devo fans.    I will admit, however, that this spud would like to see Devo crank out an album more reminiscent of their earlier fare, like \\"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\\"

Have never been a Jennifer fan, but the chemistry between Alex and Jennifer was great! I like Jennifer a bit more now than before. Funnier than I thought it would be. Alex steals the show on this, not only on the funny lines and his facial expressions (he's got amazing facial expressions that just add to scenes) but when he takes off his shirt! WOW! Sexy! Will be placing my pre-order!
0307454541|2.0|This can't-put-it-down book is only too easy to put down. I think the problem lies less with the author than with the editor or editors who, it seems to me, were asleep at the wheel. What we have here is a good story line, several reasonably well conceived characters, and one unusually interesting off-beat character in the person of tatooed  Lisbeth Salander. But the whole thing is put together in language that alternates between ponderous and clunky. And author Steig Larson never misses an opportunity to use a hundred words where a carefully chosen twenty would have done the job better. An alert editor would have picked up on this and made the appropriate cuts and condensations. One telling passage quite early in the story gives us a scene where protagonist Mikael Blomkvist is in the unhappy position of having to listen to a long, drawn-out tale told by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger. Blomkvist grows understandably impatient, and readers can be forgiven if they share his impatience. Vanger's story twists and turns, and seems to lack purpose or direction. It does, in fact, have plenty of purpose and direction, but if Vanger were a better storyteller, he would have spelled it out to poor Blomkvist more succinctly and more dramatically. Unfortunately, author Larson shared Vanger's inability to use crisp, concise language in this wannabe thriller. An attentive editor would have cut the many irrelevancies and repetitions and transformed this book into the thriller that it tries so hard to be. Instead, we are served with a promising manuscript; not a finished novel.
B00003CXAA|3.0|The title says it all.<br />I was quite disappointed when in the middle of the second film I had to take out the current disc and put in another. If I had known this, I would have never purchased this boxed set. Other than that, it was as good as the movies were.

I have also taken the time to read some other reviews about the product, and I would to refute something that another rater mentioned.. this is not in any way or form an anatomy book, and it specifically says it focuses on \\"how to draw the head\\". I'm giving it a 4 rating, due to the fact the author/artist tends to stick with the same type of head poses (full front& three quarter) but besides the lack of poses this book is very good in explanation of methods, and how to's as well has problem solving. I would also rate this book as being good for beginners, and there are great chapters on shape and value that would be very useful for some one who is struggling to understand those areas. If your looking for a good reference, and less wordy printing with plenty of examples,then this would be a book to add to your collection. :)
B000F8O4E0|5.0|\\"Face The Music\\", #8 in 1975, was ELO's 5th studio album.  ELO was coming off their most successful album \\"Eldorado\\" and tour, with them getting larger crowds more than ever. Jeff Lynne also found a  little recording studio in Munich, Germany called \\"Musicland\\" were they found Engineer Mack, who would help them out all the way through \\"Time\\".  1975's \\"Face The Music\\", is their most friendly album to date, but it's still got some of the progressive sound of their earier albums.  The band also brought in two new members, bassist Kelly Groucutt and Cellist Melvyn Gale.  The album starts off with a track everyone seems to love, but has never appeared on ANY ELO collections, AMAZING!!!  that song is,<br /><br />\\"Fire On High\\"- The ultimate rock instrumental, backward masking used here, loved playing the album in college and spinning it backwards.  The guitar section was used on CBS Sports Spectacular every Saturday afternoon.  Bev plays great drums on this track.<br /><br />\\"Waterfall\\"- \\"Without friends and lovers, you can never go on living.\\"  Settles down the pace, a very lush track that should of been a single, ELO did \\"Can't Get It Out Of My Head\\", the year before, this one was just as good.<br />Again Bev's drumming is top notch.<br /><br />\\"Evil Woman\\"- \\"You made a fool of me\\".  1st single, hit #10, this has that great Richard Tandy piano intro, still the most played ELO track on classic rock radio 35 years later. A lot of critics said this was there foray into disco music(what a crock), it's just great pop-rock music.<br /><br />\\"Nightrider\\"-\\"She's a ten a penny dream\\". A great song Jeff wrote about one of his early bands The Nightriders.  A concert favorite for several years, just another great track that should get more attention by classic rock radio, and everybody that loves this band!  Jeff and Kelly trade off lead vocals here, they worked well together.<br /><br />\\"Poker\\"- \\"Play another hand, lose everthing that I am.\\"  Straight ahead rocker, with Kelly Groucutt taking over lead vocals, I can't understand how people can dismiss this band as just a sugar band, Jeff is one of the most talented artist out there, he gave ELO a sound that a lot of bands tried to capture, but couldn't.<br /><br />\\"Strange Magic\\"-\\"No i'm never gonna be the same again\\". 2nd single, hit #14, a nice slow song with those swooping strings, when I was younger I was getting Pilot's \\"Magic\\" screwed up with ELO's \\"Strange Magic\\".<br /><br />\\"Down Home Town\\"- \\"We got the best town band around\\".  The band said they favor with this track, but i've always loved it!  It's just very creative, it's got that dixie sound and the late Ellie Greenwich and Flame vocalist Marge Raymond(Time to release their stuff on CD) on background vocals.  Just a fun track, that most bands today can't come up with.<br /><br />\\"One Summer Dream\\"- \\"Deep water's fall, out to the sea\\".  A slice of pure pop magic, Richard's c lavent and the strings are something else.  One of Jeff's finest compositions, Ellie's background vocals really add to the song.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on this disc include,<br /><br />\\"Fire On High\\" (intro) - bare boned version, only 3 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Evil Woman\\"-Added a verse here, this the stripped down version, Jeff said he liked this version best, I like 'em both.<br /><br />\\"Strange Magic\\"- U.S. single mix- You can get this on the first \\"Face The Music\\" CD, because they released it with only the single versions of this song and \\"Evil Woman\\".<br /><br />\\"Waterfall\\"- instrumental mix, not bad, not that essential.<br /><br />Am not a guy that cares too much for the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, but I find it funny they put in rappers and weak pop singers(Madonna etc.) before this band who have released a dozen very good albums and 26 top 100 hits!<br />Jeff Lynne and the band deserve better.<br /><br />The Band from 1975-1980.<br />Jeff Lynne guitar, keyboards, lead vocals  12-30-47<br />Bev Bevan  drums  11-24-44<br />Richard Tandy piano, keyboards3-26-48<br />Kelly Groucutt  bass, vocals  9-8-45  d. 2-19-09.<br />Melvyn Gale cello  1-15-52<br />Hugh McDowell cello  7-31-53<br />Mik Kaminski violin  9-2- 51
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Pretty much the greatest show ever, yeah one season, right? How could it possibly be so great with all the loose plot threads that will never be answered? Or with so little time to develop characters? It is, perhaps, unexplainable, the only way to truly understand is to watch it for yourself, watch them all, (the way I made the show seem longer is by watching one episode like three times a month). But seriously watch them and then watch the movie because its essentially a season two in two hours. Once you see it, you'll understand.
B000006TRV|5.0|one of the best albums ever, another brick in wall part 2 is good but its too main stream I like part 3 of another brick in the wall better.    An almost all the songs R good stuff on this album. I don't like the final cut because that sounds like junk but rest R worth getting.    I'm 30 an always liked pink floyd because rite back I was a kid I remember hearing em all the time, same with the beatles an frank zappa. I grew up liking em...anyway enuff bout past, but there are other good bands too but this one will always be one of me number 1 favorite same with Frank Zappa.      Too me I don't care about other people options, I think most 90s an today music R terrible, like nickel back, linkin park, jay z, ja rule, slipkont, etc. Most of todays hard rock, etc. an hip hop r garbage.    Hip hop, rap and RnB are ok like their arent bad for background music in my work but their never good enuff for me too buy any of their albums. An listen too at my home or in my car.

A family like her in society is not an average family that would so such a thing. If she didn't like the guy, she'd not have bene forced to.  She is just an opportunist who used whatever lies she could to get a residency in a western country.
159448385X|2.0|After reading and thoroughly enjoying Kite Runner, I was excited to read Husseini's next novel.      I was really disappointed.      He deftly illustrates the systematically inhumane and tragic treatment of women in Afganistan, a worthy and important goal, but there is little else to the 400+ pages that is interesting or engaging.      I can understand that the immersive, numbing suffering that the reader experiences is a small representation of the persistent oppression that women in Afganistan must endure,  but I expected more than just that.  The private and restorative moments of interaction between the women in the evenings is lacking in detail and underdeveloped, many of the events and characters seem overly theatrical and shockingly one-dimensional.    The events at the beginning of the book are so compelling and intriguing, then the middle 350+ pages are just a relentless collection of sadistic montages, and disappointingly, the 'payoff' or resolution of the book felt rushed, and a bit careless.    This particular book was an unecessarily soul-crushing way to gain exposure and impact of important issues regarding women's rights in Afganistan, under 30 years of shifting ideologies, war and chaos.  I wish the author would have just written a magazine article instead.
0471463396|3.0|Greenwald is a horrendously dry, boring, and confusing author to read. This book isn't meant to be entertainment, but educational; but his writing style practically ensures you will have a horrible time reading this.     The first half of the book presents the authors theories of securities analysis. He gives several \\"case studies\\", but they offer little help in real-world application once you have put the book down. The ideas given in here are coated in Graham-esque language and philosophy, but at the core it is the author's flimsy and not entirely well-thought out theories which are rooted in the efficient market hypothesis. Some of the things he says are correct, but the whole idea leaves you with several, \\"yea, but...\\" sort of questions.    The second half of the book presents mini-biographies of a few well-known \\"value investors\\". These have some merit, but you can find better ones elsewhere.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|This remake was well made and very entertaining. Jadan Smith was charming and amazing as Dre, while Jackie Chan brought his acting to a whole new level. The Action was awsome and the storyline was well done. I can't wait for this film to make its way to DVD so that i can bring it home and add it to my Karate Kid Collection of films.
1591843162|5.0|Seth describes this new world with words that really make you think.  This book is NOT a step by step plan for how to change.  It is a thought-provoking book, filled with descriptions and anecdotes.  It is up to you to create your own road map to become indispensable.  Or, in Seth's words, become a linchpin.<br /><br />Seth writes in his usual, concise style.  He does repeat some concepts, but this makes them all the more powerful.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book are:<br /><br />**Yes, the world is changing, but you are in control.  You have a choice as to how you want to be.  Do you want to be a \\"compliant, low-paid worker...\\" or do you want to become indispensable, a linchpin?<br />**Seth's views on school.  He describes school as a place that teaches us to sit quietly, to fit in and to memorize facts for a test.  This doesn't translate well into the real world.<br />**We all have the ability to create art.  Seth's definition of art is \\"anything that's creative, passionate and personal.\\"<br />**Think of your work in terms of a gift and not a chore.  Seth cites the example of David, the coffee boy at Dean & Deluca, who makes every task and interaction with customers a great experience.<br />**Let go of the busy work.  Yes, this makes you feel better and feel like you're doing something.  But this busy work is not getting you closer to your goals.  This is just your lizard brain (another great Seth analogy).<br />**The `secret' is that there is no map.  You must create your own path.  This is nothing new, but Seth's approach is a new one.<br /><br />A highly-recommended, thought-provoking book, that makes you look at your career with new eyes.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|True, if you have read the book, then this movie is terrible.  If you just go see the movie, you will find it mildly entertaining.  Director Chris Columbus does try to put lots of detail into the direction of photography (especially the boat ride into Hades) but the script writing assumes way too many liberties with omitting important story details.  ie:  Clarissa - daughter of Mars, and the God Mars himself!    The book did a nice adaption of the Olympic Gods to the Western world/culture, but the movie just does not have the charming details or great character build up that the book has.  Pierce Brosnan looked and acted like he wished he were elsewhere.    All in all:  too many rushed, left out or thrown together parts just to make it fit into a teen wanna-be movie.   Not even worth renting!  Save your money and wait to see it for free on TV, even then I bet you will end up turning the channel...!

B003CIG7AE|5.0|I have to write and give these guys 5 stars because they are a lot better than some of the garbage music out there. I didn't even know who these guys were until I saw them open up for Pearl Jam this past May. Wow, I was amazed. Such a unique combination of souful rock and country, even though I'm not a country band. The lyrics are artful and they are able to play slow and fast songs equally well. It took me a few listens on this record to come around after listening to their first 2 and also loving them. I hear they have a Tour EP which isn't sold anymore but you can find on Ebay sometimes for around $40 or so. Ahhh. But probably worth it. Anyway, this album is great and I can't wait to see these guys again. I believe you can download :Laredo: for free on Amazon. I can't really pick out any stand out favorite songs because I think they all have their own flavor and style. Just a great indy band. Peace.
0375704027|5.0|\\" . . . or should I say, she once had me?\\" The opening line of the Beatles' enigmatic hit \\"Norwegian Wood\\" might almost be a summary of Haruki Murakami's 2000 novel of the same title. Toru Watanabe, a Japanese writer traveling to Germany, hearing the song over the airplane sound-system, is pulled back two decades to his first years at university in Tokyo. The girl, Naoko, clearly exerted a strong hold over him, though her face is disappearing into the mists of the past. When Toru met her, Naoko was sweetheart of his best friend in high school, Kizuki; both of them were left abandoned when Kizuki was killed shortly before graduation. Toru meets up with her again in Tokyo, and for most of the year they maintain a challenging weekend friendship that, though emotionally enigmatic, is clearly necessary to both of them. Then Naoko unexpectedly drops out of school.<br /><br />Toru, meanwhile, is going through all the usual freshman challenges: balancing social life and study, getting used to dormitory living, negotiating detente with a roommate, meeting people from backgrounds other than his own, and finding his bearings around girls. For while his relationship with Naoko is basically chaste, Toru falls in with a brilliant student named Nagasawa whose principal distraction from studying for (and acing) his Foreign Service exams is going on Saturday night prowls for bar girls, and some of his success rubs off. And almost as a result of this promiscuity, the moral dimension of the book opens up. One of the things that greatly impresses me about the novel is how totally it avoids being preachy. Friendships grow in their various ways, and quite separately, drunken or otherwise, flings happen. It is only gradually that Toru realizes the contradictions and begins to form a personal ethic that ushers him into adulthood. As I recall, this business of doing it first and understanding it later is what late adolescence is mostly about.<br /><br />Forget the Japanese setting; this is student life anywhere. People who have grown up with the Beatles and other artists of the sixties will also identify with the many musical references that play through the novel like a soundtrack. The book's sexuality is also perfect for its age-group: sometimes raunchy, sometimes jokey, occasionally surprisingly tender. Midori, Toru's closest friend in Tokyo after Naoko leaves, is as liberated as they come, but her life is also darkly shadowed. Because this period of wild experiment and life-changing discoveries also brings one close to tragedy. Many of the companions in Toru's memories have since died, some by their own hand. Happiness is fragile and life laced with loss, but Murakami can be entirely trusted as a guide to both. I cannot think of a better book for young adults to read; just be aware that they will run a mile before discussing it with their parents!where.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have an UPPA Baby Vista stroller and I did not want to purchase their 24 dollar cup holder. So I found this and decided to try it. I LOVE it. It's exactly what I needed. The handle bars on the Vista are at an angle and when you attach this it sits perfectly level. I have not had a problem with it tipping over when full...even when I have 1 drink/bottle it. I love that it has a zipper pocket. The center compartment is perfect for keys, cell phone and a wallet. It says it is insulated....and it is but very lightly and only on one side but I'm ok with that. I don't even have to remove it when I collapse the stroller! It doesn't interfere with anything.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|I recently got Season 1 of TNG as a gift and wanted to just go ahead and complete the collection.    So I came here and behold! The entire collection in 1 go! Fantastic.  Then I checked out how much it would be if I just got the 6 seasons I am missing.    It turns out that I would end up paying nearly $90 more for this BOX versus the Season box sets 1 by 1.  Buying seasons 2-7 only amounted to about $220 at a price between $36-37.99. (Seasons 1-7 would run you $259.93 before any shipping costs, roughly saving you $60.)    Seems to me that the price of this thing with it's sub-standard packaging would aim to be LESS of a cost, rather than more.    Anyhow, I ended up going with the single season box sets and am perfectly happy with them, and the $90 or so I saved by doing so.    I hope this helps someone out in a similar situation.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I have been a Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers fan nearly all of my life.  Honestly, I've never heard a bad album from these guys.  Yes, they've had albums that were either criticly acclaimed but didn't sell well or were too personal for the average listener to get.    \\"Mojo\\", in my personal opinion, has all the makings to be a modern classic.  The band's love for all things music really comes through and it comes through raw.  Hints of jazz peek through the thick layers of heavy blues, sounds that are reminiscent of The Allman Brothers and other great Southern Rock bands and, yes, Petty still has some classic rockers in there, as well.    Petty & The Heartbreakers' last attempt at a live-in-the-studio recording was 1982's \\"Long After Dark\\", which was met with heavy criticism and yielded 1 big hit (\\"You Got Lucky\\") and a minor hit with \\"Change Of Heart\\".    This time around, Petty & The Heartbreakers hit nerve after raw nerve, capturing lightning in bottle and sharing the feeling you get from a live performance of this legendary group.  And, there is no question that guitarist Mike Campbell issues a performance on this album that will make the Vais and the Satrianis chartreuse with envy.    This, ladies and gentleman, is rock & roll.  Pure and simple.  No game show contestants.  No eye make-up.  Just no-nonsense rock & roll. God, I love it!

B000007MVD|5.0|This is absolutely the best post-breakup release from the Beatles.  Nothing else even comes close, with the possible exception of \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\".  A CD/DVD release of \\"The Beatles at Shea Stadium\\" would be very cool, especially if EMI could get clearances to release all of the music from the show including the opening acts (King Curtis, the soundtrack to the dancers, et al.).  It has only been 45 years; patience is a virtue.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Hollywood couldn't have a good show that taught morals, character, goodness, kindness, had a preacher (shepherd) that wasn't a weirdo and was a good man and so they cancelled it. I didn't receive FOX with my \\"rabbit ears\\" back when this was on, so I had not watched it until recently. One show has the shepherd explaining that the Bible isn't supposed to make sense, it is a book of faith, BUT it does make sense if you read it, study the texts and look at it without preconcieved historical religious dogma.     Watching this, I'm reminded of \\"Terminator, Sarah Connor Chronicals\\", which was also cancelled by FOX and was a great show. Years ago, \\"Christy\\" was on CBS and it had a huge fan base, but it had loving, good, Bible believing people in it, so they cancelled that (looking back on it, it was a little too melodramic, at least the first season).  Did you know that old sensoring standards said that movie or tv shows had to show God and Christianity in a good light?  Anyway, I love this show and am sad it didn't keep going.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|It only took 30 years or so, but Devo is finally getting the acclaim they have so richly deserved!  Originally written off as a quirky, early eighties fad (like Rubik's Cube), the masses failed to \\"get\\" Devo's brilliant and evolving (er,de-evolving) creative vision.  Devo was also a victim of the American guitar rock crowd, who refused to accept  a band who dared to use (gasp! Are you ready for this) synthesizers and electronics.  Despite what many people believe, Devo did not start out as a punk band, but an experimental art band that used synths and electronic drums, along with guitars and traditional instruments.  Truthfully, not much has changed.  As brilliant as their first album was, its' guitar laden sound gave a false impression of who Devo really are, and people have been complaining ever since.  It is truly amazing the criticisms and backlash Devo encountered as they became more and more electronic.  Reading reviews of their albums always starts out with the reviewer lamenting how there is more and more synths, and less guitar.  Who cares!  Music is music, and Devo is Devo, whatever instruments they use.  I'm convinced that their later albums (excluding Smooth Noodle Maps) are seen as not as good as their first two simply because they are heavily electronic.  Devo dared to reverse the roles of guitar and keyboards, making synths the lead and guitar more of a supporting role, and got scalped for it.             Something For Everybody brings back the clever genius that was missing from Smooth Noodle Maps and Total Devo.  The confidence, as well as the sound of their New-Wave era is back.  The sound of this album is clearly rooted in the 1980-82 era Devo, mostly '81-'82.  The album is full of vocals, sounds, guitar riffs, and drum beats that are reminiscent of the songs from those albums.  \\"Fresh,\\" \\"Don't Shoot,\\" and \\"Sumthin\\" sound like Freedom Of Choice era Devo.  \\"What We Do\\" has a nerdy chorus similar to \\"Through Being Cool\\", \\"Mind Games\\" sounds like \\"Soft Things\\" and maybe even \\"Find Out.\\"  There are all sort of bits and pieces reminiscent of classic Devo.  There is certainly more guitars on this album than any since Freedom Of Choice, and they are louder, with more solos.  Missing from this album is sampling and digital synths, which played a major role on Shout and every following release.  Instead, Something is full of quirky, New-Wave sounding analog synths, all brilliantly played by Mark Mothersbaugh.  This is maybe why most songs are sung by Gerald Casale (like on NUTRA).  Structurally, the album mimics Freedom Of Choice, 12 songs, short and sweet.  The last few songs seem to break away with trying to be classic era Devo, and sound more like stuff that could be on Total Devo or Smooth Noodle.  Nothing wrong with that, as Devo should be allowed to grow musically and be more serious, not always being tongue and cheek.  \\"Cameo\\" is a weird, but funny song ('a la \\"Blow Up\\") that gives the album a needed short break from Devo's usual schtick.  \\"No Place like Home\\" picks up the serious, more emotional tone first heard on Total Devos' \\"These are the Things\\".  All in all this is a great album, as good as possibly could be expected, and way deeper than most modern music.  March on Devo!!!
B003ELOQD4|5.0|Despite the other reviews posted here, for live concert footage, this is pretty darn good.  The editing was reasonable - not too shifty.  The picture and audio quality are simply fine.  This is a must-have disk.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This was overall just an excellent movie. There is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie so I will just jump into a few of the things that I really liked about it. First, Doug and Kevin where so charming. Well, to be frank the entire movie is amazing charming in its own way, but Doug and Kevin especially. The movements of the bird are just amazing, and the things that the dogs say and do are exactly what you would expect a dog to do, they captured it perfectly. They were quirky and funny and loveable all at the same time, something that the guys over at Pixar are really good at.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie was a bit more dark than I was expecting it be, but it set up the rest of the story so well. I felt like this was an animated movie, but really had a lot of meaning to just about anyone who watched it. There were some really hard-hitting moments, most in the early part of the movie, that really got the viewer emotionally attached to the characters. And I think that is important for the movie to work.<br /><br />The only negative is that som of the events that occurred once they landed were a bit predictable. But it was still a fun ride the whole way through. None of this movie felt like filler or boring for even a second from the opening to the credits. The whole adventure feeling of the movie was exciting and engaging. And the progression of Mr. Fredricksen throughout the movie was heart-warming and satisfying.<br /><br />Overall, this is just an amazing movie, and unquestionably my favorite animated movie I have ever seen.

B001HN6940|3.0|I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, and like most people, am a fan of Alice in Wonderland, so I didn't think twice about buying this movie.  Being available in Blu-Ray was an added bonus.<br />I wish I could return this movie and get the 20 bucks back.  It just didn't \\"do it\\" for me, with the storyline being \\"corny\\" (I know, the original is corny, too, but I'm talking CORNY) and the actors were just \\"odd\\"...<br />I didn't realize it was a Tim Burton production--that would have alerted me to the crash-and-burn movie it turned out to be.  (I am not a Burton fan...)  This movie is just like all of his other movies, so if you are a fan, you might be more inclined to like it than I.<br />As far as the special effects, they are impressive, and the Blu Ray does make them stand out better than a regular DVD.<br />I guess I just wish I'd rented it instead of spending so much on it, knowing that I won't be watching it again.

0199536481|3.0|Any translation is going to be less than the original if the writer of the original had any skill with words. Laclos wrote extremely well, so it is inevitable that an English translation runs the risk of being heavy-handed in comparison with the original text. Alas, this translation is indeed a lesser production.  But, despite that fact, it's worth reading unless you can come by a better version. Two hundred years ago the epistolary novel was all the rage (in English, Richardon's Pamela was the non plus ultra of the genre, though many including myself far prefer Fielding). Laclos' work stands head and shoulders above all other epistolary novels in any European language. Not only is the device, in his hands, quite believable but the human observation is far more acute and true to life than anything else being written at that time. Far from echoing the conventions of plot and character typical of his era, Laclos writes what he knows to be true.  And this is the novel's enduring appeal.<br /><br />The heart of the story is essentially an emotional chess game played by two well-matched adversaries who formerly were, briefly, lovers. The Marquise de Merteuil, an older woman, is playing against the Vicomte de Valmont, a dashing younger rake. Laclos brilliantly enables us to see the intrinsic egoism of both protagonists and at the same time their emptiness and frailty. Even as Valmont seems to be moving smoothly from one conquest to another, Merteuil is playing his own ego against him, exploiting a weakness he simply doesn't see until too late. Merteuil exhorts Valmont to seduce the most faithful woman in France, telling him that it will be his ultimate triumph. And Valmont, like a proud and vain little boy, does just that - but in the process comes to a vague awareness that this woman (the Madame de Tourvel) can offer him something far greater than a living sheath for his rampant organ. He glimpses an adumbration of true love. Merteuil detects this from his letters and of course is threatened to her core. She gave Valmont only her skills as a seductress; Tourvel could give him so much more. So Merteuil plays her finest move: she plays on Valmont's enormous ego to persuade him to break Tourvel's heart and thus prove himself to be the ultimate rake.  Valmont, lacking sufficient emotional resources to be his own man at this crucial point, does as he is bid - and then realizes that he's thrown away the only thing that really mattered in his entire life.<br /><br />The sub-plots are satisfying and the characters are finely drawn. There are moments of cruel humor and even bawdy pathos, though such a thing sounds improbable in the abstract. The denouement is as awful as it is inevitable, and Merteuil is left the meaningless victor of a game in which all the pieces have been smashed beyond redemption.<br /><br />This is not a book to appeal to those who want fantasies about human nature, or who require happy endings. But for anyone interested in a surgical examination of human foibles and the degree to which self-deception can go, this is a must-read. And for anyone who can read French, of course it's so much better to go to the original than to have to wade through a fairly insipid translation.is threatened to her core.

B00275EHJG|4.0|What has always appealed to me about the \\"Toy Story\\" films, aside from the fantasy that toys are secretly able to speak, is that they add genuine emotion to scenarios real toys find themselves in. In the first movie, Woody the Cowboy was threatened by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, a new, high tech toy that upstaged Woody's nostalgic charm. In the second movie, Woody faced the possibility of becoming a displayed collectable, to be gawked at instead of played with. Now we have \\"Toy Story 3,\\" and it follows its predecessors by introducing another unfortunate reality: That of a child outgrowing his or her toys. What's to become of them then? Sometimes, they're stowed away in the attic for sentimental reasons. Sometimes, they're donated to charities or daycare centers. Sometimes, they're thrown away. In any case, it always seems to end badly for the toys.    This is the situation that Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen), and their toy pals find themselves in when their long-time owner, Andy (voiced by John Morris), prepares to move away from home, ready to start college. After a series of missteps and daring rescues, the toys wind up at a local daycare facility, which by all accounts seems like an ideal place. Plenty of children. No emotional attachment. Lots of other toys to befriend. But appearances can be deceiving; Woody's friends end up in the hands of aggressive toddlers, who are clearly too young to appreciate the value and delicacy of the toys they're given. Worse still is a tyrannical prison system overseen by the cuddly but heartless Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). It's up to Woody, who was supposed to move to college with Andy, to rescue his friends before it's too late.    While not quite at the level of their previous masterpieces \\"WALL-E\\" and \\"Up,\\" \\"Toy Story 3\\" still proves that the folks at Pixar are the real deal, masters not only of computer animation but also of story, characterization, writing, and directing. It's notmerely a bright and colorful series of images for kids to stare at in amazement; it's an emotional journey for people of all ages, correctly founded on the assumption that even adults remember what it was like to be young, carefree, and devoted to their toys. It's incredibly funny, but it's also incredibly exciting, and there are moments of such wonderful sweetness that they bypassed my brain and found their way directly to my heart. It doesn't play down to its audience - it's sincere in its efforts to be both entertaining and heartfelt. It's also in 3-D, although I must admit, I'm finding the process less and less necessary with every new release.    Along with Lots-O', a number of other memorable characters are introduced. One of the best is Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton), both a direct reference to and a parody of the famous Mattel Ken doll. His footsteps are wooden and jerky, his joints limited in their flexibility. He lives in a spacious Dream House, and he flaunts a wardrobe-stuffed closet that even Carrie Bradshaw would be jealous of. He, of course, immediately falls for the newly-arrived Barbie (voiced by Jodie Benson), who's cute femininity belies a toughness that Ken would be hard pressed to outdo.    And then there are the toys owned by the loveable Bonnie (voiced by Emily Hahn), who Woody meets entirely by accident. Mr. Pricklepants (voiced by Timothy Dalton) is a stuffed hedgehog who fancies himself a master thespian. Trixie (voiced by Kristen Schaal) is a blue triceratops who seems to be somewhat of a computer nerd. Buttercup (voiced by Jeff Garlin), a plush unicorn, finds Mr. Pricklepants annoying. Dolly (voiced by Bonnie Hunt), levelheaded and calm, is a ragdoll whose look must have been inspired by Raggedy Ann.    Most of the characters we've come to love are part of this new story, including Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Hamm (voiced by John Ratzenberger), Rex (voiced by Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (voiced by Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney). Even after fifteen years of friendship, it's interesting to see the ways in which their camaraderie is tested. Take Buzz; when a switch on his back is tampered with, he reverts to his old self, once again believing he's an actual space pilot defending the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg. Attempts to fix him result in a hilarious language-setting malfunction, changing his voice - and his dancing moves - from English to Spanish.    \\"Toy Story 3\\" could have easily gone wrong; sequels, especially those beyond the second chapter, are generally inferior, serving mostly as a way to continue marketing a franchise. Despite being the third in the series, this movie just as fun, just as charming, just as good-looking, and just as fresh as the original 1995 film. Should I have expected a different outcome? At this point, it's becoming less and less likely that Pixar will ever go wrong. The people there know how to make movies. More to the point, they know how to tell a story. They understand that even animated films deserve mature themes that adults can appreciate. They're technical wizards. Their creativity is second to none. What will they think of next? Something great, no doubt.

B002ZG9828|4.0|As much as I hate sounding like a cinematic apologist, I can't deny it when I enjoy a film in spite of almost universal disdain. Having given passing grades to critically lambasted films like \\"10,000 B.C.,\\" \\"The Women,\\" \\"Nine,\\" and most recently, \\"Legion,\\" I will once again raise my voice in defense of \\"Jonah Hex,\\" a loud, aggressive, lightning-quick revenge tale that seems to have no qualms about its delightfully preposterous premise or its gloriously fantastical vision of nineteenth-century America. It was made, I believe, not only in the spirit of fun as an escapist action spectacle, but also as a statement - weak though it may be - about terrorism and modern nuclear war. Have better films been made with these qualities? You bet. Still, this movie achieved everything it wanted to achieve, and with all due respect to those who wrote scathing reviews, sometimes you can't ask for any more than that.    Adapted from the comic book by John Albano and Tony Dezuniga, the film tells the story of the title character (Josh Brolin), who in the 1860s served the Confederate Army before disobeying a direct order and being forced to kill one of his fellow soldiers. That soldier's father, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), retaliated by killing Hex's family and branding the right side of his face, turning it into a gaping mass of scar tissue. Although never adequately explained, it seems Hex gained supernatural powers from his near death experience, namely the ability to raise the dead with a touch of his hand. This will come in handy on more than one occasion; it's especially fun, in its own ghoulish way, when he has to dig up the grave of Turnbull's son to extract information.    But I'm getting ahead of the story. Believing Turnbull dead, Hex has spent the last number of years as a lawless bounty hunter, driven by profit instead of loyalty, sought after only as a last resort. And that's exactly where the American government is at; President Ulysses S. Grant (Aiden Quinn) haslearned that Turnbull is still alive, plotting to destroy Washington D.C. on July 4, 1876, America's centennial. Grant and his staff know that only Hex can stop him. Hex accepts their offer, not out of patriotism but because he and Turnbull have unfinished business. In many ways, the two are exactly the same: Both have lost loved ones; both are driven by revenge; both hate the American government. So what exactly would Hex get out of this if he were to succeed? He's certainly not looking to be a national icon.    Tagging along is Hex's love interest, a prostitute named Lilah (Megan Fox), who isn't given all that much to do except look hot, fight men twice her size, deliver smart-aleck one-liners, and pack weapons in all sorts of naughty places. It's hard to find another angle of approach here; apart from the obvious visual appeal, I suspect nothing of value would have been lost if this character had been eliminated from the screenplay. Honestly, she's about as necessary to the plot as the appendix is to the human digestive system. Of course, we don't begrudge the appendix just because it happens to be useless. So why should we begrudge this character? How can we given the fact that the plot is equally useless?    The film runs at a brisk eighty minutes, and that includes the end credits. What I find amazing is that, with such a short running time, director Jimmy Hayward still managed to tell a cohesive and fairly complete story, which makes me second-guess my belief that being thorough doesn't necessarily mean being exhaustive; I learned pretty much everything I needed to know about the plot, the settings, and the characters, the only exception to the latter being Lilah. Perhaps this is because nothing about the story is based in reality - not even the Civil War, which had only passing references to begin with, seems genuinely depicted. Or perhaps it's because there wasn't much to expand on, the characters being little more than stick-figure caricatures. Whatever the case, its length had no real impact on its quality, and that's really saying something.    I guess what I'm saying is that I enjoyed this film specifically for its silliness, its tongue-in-cheek attitude to the material, its comic book mindlessness. I also enjoyed the allusions to past and present political situations, specifically as related to the development and usage of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Granted, the allusions are momentary at best; what you're really supposed to focus on is the fun. \\"Jonah Hex\\" will never be considered a great film. It won't even be considered a good film. In all likelihood, it will be forgotten ten years down the line. Nevertheless, I do think it can be enjoyed as the violent flight-of-fancy it was so clearly intended to be. If there ever was a movie made purely for your entertainment, this would be it.
B000002KCV|4.0|As I work my way through Neil Young's discography the not surprising conclusion that I have reached, as of 1978, is that he could do little wrong. I was a fan but not an uncritical follower. Whether he was rocking or country-folking I really enjoyed everything from his debut until this release. Comes a Time is a complete turnaround from Zuma, Tonight's the Night and On the Beach. It represents a return to the gentler tones of Harvest and After the Gold Rush. However, fortunately for his fans, Comes a Time is much more than an album that simply repeats the successes of those two prior albums. It is more because of the high quality of the songs. There isn't a weak song on this CD. I particularly like his take on Ian & Sylvia's Four Strong Winds. This wasn't an earth shattering record. It won Young no new fans. It was more a very competent and enjoyable holding pattern. The next big move was just months away. I can hardly wait.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|The first thing that came to mind with the iPad was \\"perfect photo device!\\" so a big selling point of it was the ability to download my photos to the iPad on-location, edit them and upload them - something I usually can't do while out taking photos or on vacation.<br /><br />In order to do that, you need the iPad Camera Kit (a currently very-hard-to-find item (I waited 4 weeks to receive mine as all the local stores sold out instantly after receiving shipments).<br /><br />Right off the bat, I love that they give you 2 adapters (1 for SD cards, 1 for USB). I had no use for the SD adapter as all my cameras are compact flash. I would have happily bought a separate CF  card reader if one were available, but no luck on that. If your camera uses something other than SD, you need to \\"tether\\" it to the iPad (meaning you plug the USB piece from the camera kit into the  iPads dock port, plug your USB cable from your camera into your camera and the other end into the USB piece on the iPad). Not the most convenient method, especially when on-the-go, but its workable.<br /><br />Plugging in my camera (a Canon 40D), the previews started to appear on the iPad. It took 36 seconds to load the first 35 previews (this is using a short USB cable and a high speed CF card (30MB/Sec). A big downside here is that you cant view the photos larger than a thumbnail without importing them, going to your photo albums, finding the folder it went to and then scrolling to find it. Importing photos (10MP RAW Files) took 6 seconds each. After importing you get the option to \\"Keep\\" or \\"Delete\\" them from the camera - this is a bit scary as if you're click-happy on the popup, you can end up deleting the photos from your camera (not a huge deal as theyre on the iPad, but definitely a bit of a scare). You can either select individual photos or choose to import everything from the card.<br /><br />Imported photos go into a new folder in you Photos app - \\"All Imported\\" - it also creates a secondary folder: \\"Last Import\\" - I would have really liked a way to create a specific folder for each import rather than lumping it all into 1 folder.<br /><br />The USB adapter is a bit picky as far as what it will accept, I hear some USB Card Readers will work with it (eliminating the need to tether your camera), but it's all a matter of trial and error. USB Keyboards work (again, not all - ones with USB ports on them will not work). You can also not import video files if you have something like a Flip HD camera. This was disappointing as the iPad would make a GREAT video playback screen (especially 720p video like the flip) - especially compared to the 1\\" screen most of these cameras have.<br /><br />A big plus to apple for including RAW support on imports (instead of just JPEG).<br /><br />With the many photo editing apps out there, you can easily take some photos on your camera, import them into the iPad, edit them however you'd like and upload them your photo sharing sites from just about anywhere. For that, it's worth it. It has all sorts of problems (no CF, requires tethering, slow import, no video, etc..) but it's the only option you have, and for that I have to recommend it.really liked a way to create a specific folder for each import rather than lumping it all into 1 folder.

B000002KCI|5.0|If Zuma was a two song CD containing just Danger Bird and Cortez the Killer it would be worth the price of a full length CD. These two songs are very reminiscent of Everybody Knows This is Nowhere - interesting lyrics and rough and ready guitar solos. However, there are seven other songs and they range in quality from great (Barstool Blues, Drive Back and Stupid Girl) to merely competent and inoffensive (Lookin' For a Love). I acknowledge that I am perhaps being a little harsh and unfair but based upon past performance I expect every song from Neil Young to be special. In any event, this is still a superb record, one that even a half-hearted Neil Young should own. And then there's Cortez. What a supremely great song it is - turn up the volume, play your air guitar vigorously and shout out the lyrics - favourite song from one of my favourite artists.
0307454541|4.0|Most reviewers have already given a synopsis of the story, so I won't bore people with it.  This book was actually the first foreign novel that I ever read.  I expected the translation to be stiff and not enjoyable.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the translator did a fabulous job translating this novel.  If it weren't for the Swedish characters and Swedish street names, one would assume that this novel was written originally in English.<br /><br />  The atmosphere of this novel allows the reader to gain a feeling of Sweden, without ever having been there.  The story is quite good also, and the main character, Salander, is very likable.  You want her to succeed, as well as hope to read more about her. (Which of course you do if you read the rest of the Millenium trilogy).  I would definitely recommend this book, as I found it quite enjoyable to read!
B000A59PMO|5.0|You can watch all the episodes on line from WB for free. I've watched the first 2 episodes and I am sold. Ordered all 3 seasons right away. The style of this show is very similar to Dead Like Me. There are alot of narration and alot of flashback. The whole season is focused on one big story and every episode has a little story of its own. I love detective story. I am surprise to see Enrico Colantoni. I remember him in Galaxy Quest. I try my best not to lol every time I see him on the episode.    The WB packaging is very good (same as the Supernatural). It is easy to take the disc out. I don't have to *pry* the disc out with ton of force. The DVD doesn't have much of those FCC stuff or Ads or useless transition screen. Play the DVD and fast forward the FCC screen and that's it. Press Play All and the show starts right away one after another. I hate those useless transition screen.     The only problem is the picture quality. It is very grainy and dark.    Overall, this is a great show with good acting. 5 stars!
B0036EH3X4|5.0|LOST, how I miss you already. Whew, what an amazing finale. It was better than I ever imagined it would be...not since season 1 has an episode so deeply focused on these characters we love. It handled each story with grace and class and ended with the theme from the beginning as strong as ever, we must find a way to live together or we die alone.  I can't express how satisfying the end was, and the way the flash sideways was used to tie everything up was just genius. Many of these actors did their best work in season 6.  Nothing but love for this show and season 6 now ranks as second only to season 1 for me...classic!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|well, I think this is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time  It really is one of those movies that really gets you to think a little bit    I honestly can relate to this movie as I used to live in the inner city     this is basically a combination of a golden fleece movie - where the relationship with the Hmoung family seems to change this man, but it's also a rite of passage - but if I told you more then I'd be giving it away.     Honestly I think this is a carefully crafted movie, and for the most part I really think it  is really well done.      I'm still a little unsure about why they ended it the way they did, but that's for you to watch and find out for yourself.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|In my opinion the previous two books by Larsson were MUCH better than this one.  Both The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo had much more action, intrigue and suspense.<br /><br />In the Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest, it's all about the tidying up of loose ends so it seems.  It picks up where the last left off, which is good, because that was one of my main drivers for buying:  I needed to know what happened!  But after the few questions and cliff-hangers were answered, it became rather dry and laborious.<br /><br />One of things that turned me off quite a bit was the political theme.  Now don't get me wrong, I do like political intrigue and suspense but here it was all too cliche, just in a different country.<br /><br />Towards the end, I did enjoy the \\"lawyer'ing\\", if you will, and the way it was written.  There was just enough to keep you going and entertained but not overdone like they can be.<br /><br />Overall, I guess it was the same-old, same-old with the same set of characters (well, maybe a couple of new ones) but nothing really all that \\"new.\\"  I suppose this kind of \\"ending\\" was inevitable but I was left with a ho-hum feeling.  Nothing like the feeling from the last two where I felt energized and couldn't wait to turn the page or for the next book to be released.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?  Hmm, if you haven't read the other two, don't bother, it wouldn't make any sense (or very little).  And, yes, I suppose if you've read the first two, you have to find out how things turn out.<br /><br />I hear there's a rumor floating around that his estate is battling over an uncovered fourth manuscript?  Now wouldn't that be interesting...hmmm.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|I'm sorry, but I thought this movie was really stupid.  It had probably the poorest plot and   story line of any movie that I've seen in a long time.  Especially one that was really hyped and hyped and hyped like it was.   It just seemed to permeate with a lot of new age philosophies   but you couldn't quite understand the point of it all, so this guy did this movie and what was he trying to tell everyone?    For me the movie was so poorly done that all the incredible special effects didn't really make it work as a movie.  IF you are going to see it to see a good movie - it honestly doesn't work as a movie.  But if you want to see some pretty cool scenery and special   effects work, I think they do a great job of that, and it is probably worth seeing for that reason   it was pretty good in that way.

B000W796OM|5.0|I came late to the Potter craze but I have enjoyed all the films and books. It is hard to pick a favorite but POA wins by a hairsbreadh with Goblet of Fire a close second.  From the first gleeful scene of the awful Aunt being blown up, to Crookshanks the cast to the last flying scene, the film is a joy with very little to pick at.  In fact, I can't think of anything to find fault with at all.  And one thing I like about all the Potter films and especially this one is the importance of real versus public perception of people and truth.  The evil murdering criminal turns out to be a wrongly accused man and the best Defense Against Dark Arts teacher is discriminated against because he is of the Werewolf persuasion.  Harry and his friends coming to understand people and that just because something appears in the newspaper it is not necessarily true is one of the best things about the series.  The need to find out for ourselves is so necessary to growing up well and I think that is the reason for much of the appeal of Rowling's work.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I can't believe it. The Spud Boys are back! And with \\"Something for Everybody.\\" Well, certainly with something for me, that's for sure! Excellent album! Driving, high energy, danceable music of the first order. Sorry, no ballads.<br /><br />I first encountered Devo in early New Wave time. An article in the Wall Street Journal talked about a minor revolution in rock music and featured Devo and Talking Heads. It must have been about 1978. Well, I loved Devo music and ended up buying all of their albums and most of those by Talking Heads, and those of a host of other Punk/New Wave acts. It was a great era in pop music history and opened the door for a flood of new talent. In my opinion, Devo was one of the best acts and I saw them live in concert at the San Diego State Open Air Theater in 1979.<br /><br />I loved Devo music, and it had a wry, tongue-in-cheek humor. When I listened to Devo, I felt good. In fact, I used to exercise to it. I skipped rope. Devo music was all just the right pace for a really strenuous workout. I got to the point that I could skip all the way through two Devo LPs staying right on the beat and with the only rest supplied by the time it took to turn the record over. Try it sometime. It's a wonderful way to listen to Devo, by the way, and when you've mastered it, you'll be able to run a marathon. It may seem strange, but I did my first marathon (early 1982) in 3 hours, 47 minutes and 95% of my training was skipping rope to Devo.<br /><br />Devo always sounded to me as if it was music coming out of a computer, and for a while, I thought it was. But when I went to the concert I could see that it was just five guys who could play really tight, highly syncopated music with a pounding beat and that had quite an unusual and distinctive sound. After Devo disappeared from the music scene, I discovered electronica music. Much of it is dance oriented and very high energy. In some peculiar ways, it reminded me of Devo and I liked it for many of the same reasons. I don't know how other people feel, but for me Devo was a direct lead-in to electronica music. I'm sure that many people who enjoy such acts as the music of Lady Gaga or LCD Soundsystem might find Devo quite enjoyable.<br /><br />In any case, this new \\"Something for Everybody\\" is quite good and true to the Devo tradition, especially to their later keyboard-dominated albums. A few of my favorite tracks are \\"Fresh,\\" \\"What We Do,\\" \\"Later is Now\\" and \\"Human Rocket\\", but all songs are quite excellent and your own preference may vary. Laugh and dance, dance, dance. The Spud Boys are back and as good as ever! Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Petersonother people feel, but for me Devo was a direct lead-in to electronica music.

0061120081|3.0|Flannery O'Connor described this as a \\"children's book,\\" and indeed the parts that are authentic and true are the misty recollections of long summer days in a small Alabama town in the 1930s. Most of the book relates charming, but not particularly unusual, adventures of a little girl, her older brother and a neighbor boy who comes to visit every summer. Most of these adventures are slight and unresolved. Scout brings a poor classmate home for lunch, and he shocks her by pouring molasses over all his food, whereupon the colored mail reprimands Scout for being a bad host. Scout and her brother are given BB rifles for Christmas, and while they are excited to receive them, they don't seem to do much with them. The main point to the airguns is that they give their father the opportunity to say that they shouldn't shoot mockingbirds. Scout chafes when her aunt moves in and tries to force her to wear pink dresses and be ladylike. Scout's brother loses his temper and destroys all the camellias in the yard of the ancient neighborhood scold, and his punishment is to read to the old lady every afternoon until she dies.<br /><br />The main plot thread concerns the recluse down the street, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley. Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill conceive assorted methods to tease Boo out of the house, but they never succeed. At the end of the book, Boo seems to save their lives by rescuing Scout and Jem from a murderous ne'er-do-well.<br /><br />In the middle of the book there are a few rather sensationalistic chapters involving a rape accusation made by the ne'er-do-well and his daughter against a crippled young negro man who lives nearby. This gives Scout and Jem's father the opportunity to act noble and plead the case of this pathetic fellow in the courtroom. However, it is never clear whether there really was a rape attempt. Upon first reading it, I thought the poor-white girl's father had beaten the girl up and perhaps had sex with her, then tried to conceal it by blaming it on the crippled negro. Another reading is that the girl had lusted after the negro, and got caught embracing him. In either case, there was no need to make an accusation of rape: the girl was not pregnant; even if she had been, the child would not be mixed-race; and as the poor-white girl was socially isolated she did not stand to lose status by having been caught with the negro. The accusation of criminal assault, then, lacks coherence. Its only purpose within the structure of the narrative is to provide a reason why the ne'er-do-well would attempt to kill Scout and her brother.<br /><br />However, this sensationalism does add a cheap gravitas to the novel, which otherwise would be little more than a string of loosely connected episodes about growing up in the small-town South. It appears this episode was added to the book for precisely this purpose. It certainly does not reflect any real-life event in Harper Lee's own childhood. Significantly, the rape case was made central to the movie version, and most synopses of the novel emphasize this episode out of all proportion to its actual weight within the book. The episode really speaks to Northern biases about the Deep South in the 1950s, rather than tell us anything about Alabama life in the 30s.the crippled negro.

0385737947|3.0|The concept behind this book is great: a teenage boy wakes up inside a giant maze, with no memories, surrounded by other boys who also don't know why they're there or what to do.  Fascinating, right?  The execution, however, was not as great. I blame the dialogue, mostly.  The boys talk in a slang which they've invented, which is distracting and at times silly, despite the extreme stress of their situation.  And you'd think they would have invented insults and \\"swear\\" words based on their locale (ie- a GIANT MAZE) but no, it's nonsense words or mashups of existing swear words.  (Shuck-face is commonly used, and made me want to punch anyone who used it.)  As I said, it's distracting and seemed to indicate that they'd been there for years, long enough to develop the status quo and their slang.  On the contrary, it's only been a few months, which seemed odd.  Also, when the protagonist, Thomas, immediately starts asking questions, the other boys become suspicious.  Why all the questions, shuck face?  Well, let's see: I just woke up in a giant maze with amnesia?  I want to know what's going on, why we're here, what are the terrible creatures stalking the maze?  Apparently, no other boy has ever asked, and this places Thomas under intense scrutiny.  Yep, didn't make sense to me either.  I spent the first half of the book wanting them all to speak like real people, and to answer some perfectly simple and natural questions that Thomas was trying to ask.  The last third of the book really pulls out all the stops though.  Questions get answered, gross weird monsters are fought, the maze is actually run (something that just doesn't happen enough for a book called Maze Runner), and the ending is a huge freaky twist.  I do want to read the next book, Scorch Trials, but I'm hoping that Dashner does a little more dialogue work.

B002IVLH60|4.0|I've only been a fan of Pearl Jam for a couple of years, and knowing that a new album was coming out, I got very excited. \\"Backspacer\\" is tied with \\"Riot Act\\" for 2nd worst album in front of only \\"Binaural\\", yet it's still a great album. I love everything they've put out (except \\"Binaural\\"), and \\"Backspacer\\" doesn't disappoint.    \\"I'm Gonna See My Friend\\" - 4/5  Uninteresting at first listen, but it's really grown on me. It's catchy, and has great power chords, but what really makes the song is the harmonized vocals during the main refrain.     \\"Got Some\\" - 5/5  Best song on the album, and one of the best songs in Pearl Jam's catalog. The composition is really cool, and you'll find yourself singing the chorus to yourself for hours (and you won't get annoyed.)    \\"The Fixer\\" - 5/5  The first single off the album. When I first heard this song I was unimpressed, and for the next month until the album came out I went back in forth between loving it and hating it. When the album came out and I heard everything as a whole, I started to really like this song. I love the time changes, the fuzzy verse riff, and the poppy chorus.    \\"Johnny Guitar\\" - 4/5  I found myself really loving this song the first time, but after repeated listens, it's starting to bore me.    \\"Just Breathe\\" - 3.5/5  Tough song. Good song/bad song. I really, really like this song, the official bootlegs and the SNL performance were great, but I really dislike the mix on this album. The flutes make the song sound cheesey and contrived, and the loud bass doesn't fit the song at all, but the song itself is great. 5/5 song, 2/5 mix. If you want to hear a good version, I suggest going to Pearl Jam's website and downloading one of their official bootlegs.    \\"Amongst the Waves\\" - 3/5  Much like \\"Johnny Guitar\\", I really liked this song when I first heard it, but it's beginning to bore me. It's catchy, but overall unsatisfying.     \\"Unthought Known\\" - 5/5  Great, great, great song. The slow build-up makes \\"Unthought Known\\" an instant Pearl Jam classic. I don't know why they picked \\"Amongst the Waves\\" as a single instead of this.    \\"Supersonic\\" - 2/5  Worst song on the album annoying and stupid lyrics, sorry guys nice try.    \\"Speed of Sound\\" - 3/5  Very average. Not too interesting, definitely not a  bad song, but there's nothing about it that makes me want to listen again.    \\"Force of Nature\\" - 5/5  Another amazing song. The song can only be described in one word--epic. Along with \\"Got Some\\" and \\"Unthought Known\\", another candidate for new Pearl Jam classic.    \\"The End\\" - 4/5  Interesting, dark song, It's kind of a downer to end an album on, but it's still a great song. The way the guitar and vocals are paired creates an eerie vibe.    Overall, a great album, but not recommended to a new Pearl Jam fan. Start of with something like \\"Yield\\" or \\"Vs.\\"
193413712X|5.0|An excellent book.  The \\"story\\" flits effortlessly between descriptions and remembrances of three generations of men, and how they engaged and disconnected with the world both physically and mentally.  Each man uses his own experiences--described in beautiful, easy prose--to explore the nature of the world and their place within it.<br /><br />Definitely worthy of a second read...or third, or fourth.<br /><br />Reads quickly.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I was honestly surprised by this.    The production on this album is incredible.  The melding together of different genres is extremely well done - as is the flow from song-to-song - and the arrangements of each song are a combination of unique, complex, and beautiful.  Not once did I feel the music from one song, had been shallowly tweaked and remixed for another.    Instead of trying sell you on the deepness and message of the album, my only recommendation would be to enjoy the music the first time you listen to this; don't try to immediately dive into the complexity of the lyrics - because you'll miss out on some surprisingly good compositions.  Also, at least in my opinion, the album is like \\"watching\\" a movie in musical form; that is, you won't be able to relate to the situation, but you can definitely relate to the plight and emotions of the characters.    If your music collection ranges from hip-hop, to pop, to heavy metal, to classical, and everything in-between; I highly recommend you pick this up.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I've been a Petty fan since day one. Most of the reviews I've read about this latest collection seem to be lukewarm. Not sure what folks were expecting but I have to say...this recording will go down as one of the best Tom and the band have ever made. It may have been easier to crank out a more contemporary sound but this is real, honest music played with the maturity and experience the guys have gained over the years. The album truly exceeded my expectations and know that it will be in my rotation of most played.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Not a bad song on this album! Whereas some bands try to do this and you can tell they've \\"deteriorated,\\" DEVO pumps out a rejuvenated, upgraded sound that's still true to their essence. Mark, the lead singer sounds as crisp as he was in '82! Having followed DEVO since back in the day ;), I must say that this is their BEST album. It's hard to tell if there will be another \\"Whip It\\" from this collage, but as I stated before...there is not a bad song on this album! I love it, My kids love it...end of story!
B003NTSBUG|1.0|This movie SUCKS.  No script, no plot, bad writing, BORING.  Half way thru it gets extremely stupid.  BAD BAD BAD
0525423842|2.0|First off, I really wanted to like this.  It could have been such a great read, but in the end, it was a major let down.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple. Theodore Boone comes from a family of lawyers. and he hopes one day to be one.  He knows a lot of judges, lawyers and clerks.  He helps his friends out who's family members are in legal trouble.  Then a huge murder case comes to town, and everyone wants to see it, including Theodore. Soon, Theodore is smack dab in the middle of it, much more than he though he would be, and ever wanted to be.  That's all I really want to say on the plot.<br /><br />*** SOME SPOILERS****<br /><br />Usually I don't like to give spoilers for books, but I have to explain the 2 stars, so I have to have some spoilers.  The biggest problem with this book is that nothing is wrapped up. Nothing.  Not the problems that Theodore helps with his classmates, and not the murder trial.  We're left hanging on everything.  This is a problem that I've had with some Grisham novels. Granted, I haven't read a lot of them, but the ones I've read, nothing is really concluded. This is the case for this book, nothing is wrapped up, and as I reader, I feel cheated.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />The characters are very good.  I honestly, liked all of them, and Theodore was a pleasure to read about.  I also liked how Grisham explained different aspects of the law for younger readers. That's why I gave it two star, instead of 1 or none.<br /><br />If you read this book, expect really good characters, but a lame ending.
B001FB5634|4.0|It was a good movie, very touching.  But is also is a very dark movie.so if anyone is wanting to watch a comedy or a gemiciky syfy movie, you will not fine it here.  Most people will shed a tear.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|TIMELESS story that everyone should own or at least see. can never be replicated or forgotten. The characters are wonderful and it is great for men and women alike.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|The documentary movie, \\"Rush:Beyond The Lighted Stage\\" is a gift that keeps on giving. (sorry for the cliche). This movie is really a gift from the Rock group \\"Rush\\" to all its fans-from the past, present and future. The band that has been around for more than 40 years and has more than its shares of ups and downs in the world of rock and roll and in their own personal lives.<br /><br />The reason that the movie is a gift from Rush is because they did not have to allow the filmmakers into their private lives to make a documentary about the rock band's history and their unconventional rise to fame and glory. But they did it for their fans. It's for all those middle-age men with greying hair who are located around the world. But they did allow it to be made. That's the most important thing. Rush fans have been peg by critics as white, middle-aged men in their 40's and 50's with greying hair who hold down steady jobs probably with families. I would even dare to say that some of these fans are grandfathers. And believe it or not there are women Rush fans out there too.<br /><br />I can attest to this because my son and I made our way down to Nashville, Tenn., for the first showing of the movie at The Belcourt Theater near Vanderbilt University on Tuesday night at 7 p.m. June 15th. Naturally, we got lost in Nashville and turned around but finally we found our way to the theater. When we arrived there was a long line that outside the building and it curve around the corner onto another street. I thought, \\"Oh crap, we'll never get a seat.\\" However, when we got inside, there was plenty of seating. There were some other men with their sons and maybe even their grandsons too. We found the perfects seats while my son went to the concessions stand to grab us a couple of cold drinks. While we were waiting in line outside, I observed the typical Rush fan and what he looked like. Like I said, most of us were white and looked about my age 48 years-old with greying hair and wearing glasses. Some of us had big bellies or smaller bellies (If you're lucky). I saw very few Rush fans with long hair these days. Most of us were dressed in casual clothes. I would say most of us had jobs or careers and probably had some sort of higher education. (I just assuming now from my journalistic observations). Also, a Rush fan walked toward the back of the line where we were standing and offered a free ticket to another Rush fan. I would say most Rush fans are kind and polite towards one of another and have a generous free spirit of giving like Rush musicians themselves, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart. After the movie, I observe the Rush fan who received the free ticket thank the other Rush fan who gave him the ticket in the men's restroom. Now, isn't that in the giving spirit of Rush shining through here.<br /><br />Too me, I was just totally enthralled and entertained throughout the movie. It starts from the beginning days of Rush in Toronto, Canada, where the trio....Geddy Lee, Bass, Alex Lifeson, Lead Guitar and Neil Peart, Drums, all grew up. Geddy and Alex were raised in the suburbs of Toronto and Neil grew up on a farm outside of Toronto. The film shows footage of Alex and Geddy while they were in high school and Alex quit high school to play music. I'm not sure about Geddy quiting school. I didn't catch that if he did. The movie also shows interviews with all three band member's parents which I thought was very touching. Geddy parents were Jewish prisoner death camp survivors from World War II and Alex parents where Yugoslavian immigrants. Neal parents owned a parts store where he worked as a teenager. The original drummer John Rutsey had to be replaced because of health reasons and that's when they brought Neil into the picture.<br /><br />Probably, the one thing that intrigued me the most about the film was how Rush decided to be just themselves and independent of everyone else on the rock scene at the time during the early and later years ofthe 1970's. They produced these abstract, conceptual albums like \\"Caress Of Steel,\\" \\"2112\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\" against all the odds of their record label but they were able to survive and remain themselves. They didn't change. I think that's the one thing that appealed to me when I first heard the band in the Fall of 1976 when my friend Donald Dillingham brought the \\"2112\\" album over to my dad's lake house in North Mississippi, was the band's really cool and freaky sound. When he put it on and we were just blow away by it. I had never heard anything like it before in my young life. Rush's music appealled to the psychics of our little minds. At the time, we were feeling like outcasts living in our own little worlds by our own choosing. Rush took us took us to a different world like the other rock groups did, but in a different way than Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath. It was a mental escapism with the combination of their music and some of mind altering substance which I quit using years ago. I won't say which one. I'm sure a lot of middle-age men had the same experiences with Rush as I have had when they were first introduced to the band.<br /><br />And movie goes on to show concert footage when they toured with bands like Kiss and Thin Lizzy just to name a few. The movie shows how Rush evolved to eventually to become the main headliner band on the scene at the time. And then they hit the big time with the album, \\"Movie Pictures\\" in 1981 where had such mega hits as \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\" which was being played on rock stations all over the world, over and over again. This was the heyday of Rush when they filling concert halls and arena all over the world. But they still do filled these halls and arenas to this day! As a side note, I saw Rush in concert four times. It was the one band that I saw more times in concert than anyone else.<br /><br />Probably, the saddest part of the movie, is when it explains the tragedy that about Neil's daughter getting killed in a car accident and then shortly loosing his wife due to an illness. Neil is a painfully private person and you could tell it was hard for him to be interviewed for the movie. I thought he was pretty uncomfortable with the interview. That's just my opinion. I may be wrong. But regardless, he did manage to do the interview because he did it for us Rush fans. Thank you Neil! The movie goes on to show some stuff on how the group regrouped after being away from it for four years because of Neil's tragedies and how he managed to cope with it by riding a BMW motorcycle 55,000 miles all over North America. He even wrote a song and book about his experiences of that road trip called, \\"Ghost Rider,\\" which is on the \\"Vapor Trails\\" album.<br /><br />Regardless, if your a big Rush fan or not, this documentary movie will have you cheering, laughing, crying and cheering again. It is a must see for all Rush fans!

B00009XNS9|5.0|I bought this truck for my 3 year old son about two months ago.  He love's this truck!  It is very realistic and seems high quality.  Note that the doors don't open on this model.    He likes playing with this truck outside, and so far we haven't had any durability issues.  I just gave it 4 stars on durability because it doesn't have a rock solid feel- particularly the side mirrors.    This was our first Bruder truck.   Bruder is now my go-to brand for little kid birthday presents (we've given two away in the last month, and they were very well received).

B001GCUO5M|4.0|Master filmmaker Martin Scorsese has returned to the big screen with his first full-length feature film in four years (2006's The Departed-winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture). Shutter Island tells the story of U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). The two Marshalls are called upon to investigate the mysterious escape and disappearance of a dangerous patient (Emily Mortimer) at Ashecliffe Hospital, an isolated and stark facility saturated with dark secrets, and run by the ominous Dr. Cawley (played magnificently by Ben Kingsley), and his associate, Dr Nehring (Max von Sydow). Everyone on the island seems to be hiding something, including the patients, who are mostly there for horrific and violent crimes.    Daniels and his partner begin to suspect that Cawley and his institution have hidden agendas, and as they dig deeper and deeper into the island's secrets, their investigation takes strange and startling turns, which lead them to wonder if they will ever be able to leave. The story is set in 1954, which allows Scorsese to skillfully play around with genre, and to tie in post WWII themes and looming Cold War fears and conspiracies. Daniels' traumatic experiences at concentration camps weave in and out of his dreams, as do visions of his deceased wife, Delores (Michelle Williams).    A great admirer of Scorsese's films, it's no surprise to me that his newest work has managed to seep deep into my thoughts, and to lurk there long after I've exited the theatre. Notice the words \\"seep\\" and \\"lurk\\". The diction I've decided on here is no accident, but rather a fluid way of describing the means by which the film works on our senses. It slowly and meticulously grinds its rusty gears toward the fascinating climax, and the foreboding hurricane approaching the island heightens the stakes and greatly enhances the atmosphere that Scorsese and veteran cinematographer, Robert Richardson, immerse us in. This will inevitable be compared to Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear in 1991, as well it should be. They are both exercises in pure style, and I myself went into this with Cape Fear in mind. It's better to examine this as a separate entity, and to appreciate the stylish elements by which the characters come to realizations and revelations.     Dennis Lehane, whose previous novels Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone were also made into excellent films, wrote the source novel. His material seems to translate very well from page to screen, and I look forward to reading the novel in the future. This may not be the best adaptation of his work, but it is certainly the most prominent of the three films, and that has everything to do with Scorsese's ferocity and craftsmanship. He doesn't make wimpy movies, and this is no exception. It's a B Movie, but its one made by a director who knows exactly what he's doing every step of the way. It's fragmented, sure, but maybe it needs to be that way.    Leonardo DiCaprio manages to deliver one of his finest performances as the tortured and hard-edged Teddy Daniels, and Mark Ruffalo does some excellent work here as his timid partner. Scorsese plays off of Hitchcock a lot in this film, and like in any Hitchcock movie, everyone is suspicious, and the truth is buried beneath layers of deceit. As more and more layers are peeled away from their surroundings, they become part of something much grander and enigmatic that they were sent for. The facility is a fortress, surrounded by electric fences and treacherous cliffs, which stormy waves slosh and grind against, corroding away the rocks below. It's a long way down.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This stand has extraordinary build quality, and feels extremely sturdy, but I still have mixed feelings about its usability.    It's rather difficult to adjust. Each of the joints is locked down by a hex bolt, which is good for sturdiness and long life, but clumsy to use and requires you to have a hex key around at all times. When they're locked down tight, there is still just enough \\"give\\" in the joints for last-minute adjustments, which is handy. But go to far and the bolts start to loosen and you're reaching for the hex key again. Additionally, there are two sizes of hex key needed, depending on what you're adjusting. Both are supplied.    The height is also hard to manage - there's only one vertical joint, which uses a momentary locking mechanism that you push while adjusting. Supporting the monitor's weight with the other hand makes it easy to get the joint to unlock, but makes the effort clumsy. Thankfully, though, the vertical joint provides plenty of height for use while seated.    While the overall build quality is superb, the seemingly-inconsequential cable management clips are poorly designed. Two plastic clips thread through the arm from opposite sides and are supposed to \\"click\\" together. Mine never click. The slightest movement causes them to pop apart. A minor thing, but nonetheless annoying.     It's possible to remove the middle arm for shallower desks. This is a nice feature and I might take advantage of it in the near future.    There are lots of high-quality parts included, including thumbscrews, an adapter plate and several mounting options. The included instructions are a little puzzling, but they do the trick.    So why the 4-star review? Because this is an awesome product for under $70. There isn't a better monitor arm at this price, and few with this level of finish quality. If you're in the market and price sensitive, it's worth putting up with its quirks. For around double the price, the new Ergotron LX mount seems like the more substantial bet.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Time and time again, Pixar has showcased to the world their ever-growing and nearly limitless talents to the world of animated filmmaking. From Toy Story to Finding Nemo, from Monsters Inc. to Wall-E, their craft and skill has expanded and deepened, and their stories have been sealed within a generation. With their newest film Up, I believe that they have once again reached new heights (pun intended).    Directed by the masterful Pete Docter, who previously wrote Wall-E, Toy Story, and who wrote and directed Monster's Inc, Up opens with the meeting of two young children named Carl and Ellie, who both want to be explorers one day. The film then transitions to what is by far the finest sequence Pixar has ever shot, showing us how these two destined souls fall in love and marry, move into their dream house, and experience hope, hardship, tragedy, and death. The opening is startlingly moving and poetic, which is due in large part it being silent, aside from a beautiful and heartbreaking score by Michael Giacchino. It is the most daring and ambitious depiction of marriage and life that I've ever seen in an animated movie.     There is a flash forward, and Carl Frederickson (voiced by Ed Asner), who is now a widower, has become a cranky, impatient, and cynical old man. He has been stricken by loss and disappointment to such a great extent that on a good day, he will leave the house only to get as far as his own front porch, where he sits and watches the city he lives in grow and expand without him.    After a government agency, headed by a man wearing a suit, sunglasses, and a cell phone, threatens to take Carl's house away from him and put him in a \\"retirement community,\\" Carl decides to finally escape. He isn't going to let anyone take Ellie's dream house away, so he ties hundreds and hundreds of helium balloons to it and sets afloat toward the legendary Paradise Falls, the place where he and Ellie's beloved hero, explorer Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer),went missing decades earlier after finding the bones of a lost creature and being accused of being a fake. This is also where Ellie and Carl always dreamed of going, and Carl now seeks to fulfill that dream for her.     Carl is joined on his journey by a Wilderness Explorer Scout named Russell, who is one of the finest child characters I have ever seen, mostly because, although he annoys Carl like he is supposed to, he never became tiresome to me. That is a rare thing.     The action sequences that follow when Carl reaches his destination are quite entertaining, and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film. Pixar's films are always very good at tickling the funny bones of both adults and children alike, and this is certainly no exception. There are dogs with faulty voice enhancing collars, a giant colorful bird-creature named Kevin who loves chocolate, and of course, Charles Muntz's beautifully crafted airship. The look of the film is dazzling, particularly the brilliant flock of balloons that carries the house across the sky. The use of color here is sublime.    My girlfriend of nearly four years, Courtney, recently lost her grandmother, to whom she was very close. Her grandfather took his grandson to see Up shortly after his wife of 40 years passed away. After watching it, he called Courtney to tell her what a tremendous affect it had on him. He said that he cried many times throughout the film, and that afterwards, he felt uplifted and comforted by its message. I myself nearly fell into tears after hearing that, and the movie means more to me for it having helped him as it did.
1453605738|5.0|I'm so glad I finally took the time to read this classic. I thought the language and different spellings (staid instead of stayed, for example) would be a hindrance at first, but I soon became so accustomed to the rhythm of it that it became a part of the story's charm. I thought the slower pace would be a turn-off, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed discovering the nuances of the relationships even more this way. I'm looking forward to reading more of Austen's gems, as well as other classics.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|When my mother saw the first trailer for Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, she scoffed and waved her hand at the screen in a gesture of pure aversion. I imagine many readers of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories had this same reaction, and I realize why. The trailers for the film actually do it a disservice by showing all the action and special effects and none of the intellectualism that the writers actually keep somewhat sacred from the source material. Its true that these loyalties are somewhat hidden beneath effects, but nevertheless, I not only liked Ritchie's reimagining of the sly sleuth, but I applauded several times throughout the film.    Like all of Ritchie's films, the plot is somewhat convoluted. Three people are credited under screenplay, which may be an indicator that this was a complex screen story to begin with. True enough, the small details of the film are vital, and the manic way that Ritchie directs serves this purpose strangely well, stripping away many pacing issues and much of the banality that could have come attached to this sort of project. As the movie begins, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) manage to bring to justice some kind of black magic-cult leader named Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is hanged for several mysterious murders around London. He then rises from the grave, and must be stopped before he fulfills his threatening plot against all of England. Meanwhile, Watson is in the process of retiring from his partnership with Holmes due to his erratic behavior and repellent lifestyle.     Of course, they must join together one last time to take down the nemesis Blackwood. In the process of doing so, they encounter Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), a criminal and former lover of Holmes' who ran off leaving him heartbroken. Robert Downey Jr. has excellent chemistry with both McAdams and Law, which is crucial in a film with such a confusing plot as this. The characters are very fun to listen to, particularly the bickeringbetween Holmes and Watson, driven by brilliant actors. Downey Jr. is superb as usual here, bringing charm and whimsy while also maintaining Holmes' boozy, fist aiming, somewhat depressed nature.     The production design is excellent here, particularly in the final showdown atop an unfinished tower bridge. To see the period placed in this context is truly fascinating. There are some wonderful Ritchie trademarks as well, and he uses all of his best hallmark shots, such as a slow-motion sequence involving a vast amount of explosives. All of these special effects, rather than burying the film's more grounded aspects, simply compliment the subtle and terrific performances, and the complicated but enduring story.     Hans Zimmer's excellent score is also noteworthy, as its banjos, accordions, harpsichords, tack pianos, drums and string sections stomp forth and chug along forcefully and confidently, denoting Holmes' certainly that this is just another case that is, as Basil Rathbone's portrayal once said, \\"Elementary, my dear Watson.\\" And, it turns out, my mom enjoyed the film.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I was initially surprised to see that there were so many 1-star     reviews for a movie that I found gripping,convincing,and moving.    Many were especially scornful of Martin Sheen's portrayal of    Robert E.Lee as a man tired and sick (although he in fact was so    at the time of the battle).           Hmm,I wonder. It couldn't be because Martin Sheen is a     prominent, unabashed liberal, could it? Surely not,since that    would be using irrelevant, non-artistic, criteria to judge and    reject a work of art, and nobody with any intellectual integrity    would do that.......Would they?
B001HN694K|2.0|Something has gone afoul in Wonderland. This is not Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, it's Tim Burton's, and it is as wondrous and curious as ever. Rather than simply recreating the world that we've seen adapted so many times from Carroll's source material, Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton have developed an entirely new spin on the world and the characters that inhabit it. There are some very interesting Burton-esque alterations that update the elements of Alice's journey quite nicely. Many touches don't work, and some are catastrophic to the film's integrity.    Woolverton's script essentially picks up where Carroll's story and other variations of it left off. Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen, and about to be forced into marriage to a pompous, snotty Lord, when she decides to run off to escape from this unbearable fate. Once again, she discovers and falls way down the rabbit hole, and so begin her adventures through \\"Wonderland.\\" She encounters all new versions of Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the Chesire Cat (Stephen Fry), the blue hookah-smoking caterpillar (Alan Rickman), the white rabbit (Michael Sheen), the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and of course, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).     What is interesting is that Woolverton has more-or-less written a sequel, and it's one that follows a far more linear, traditional path of storytelling than Carroll's book. Alice doesn't experience a series of independent encounters that are meaningless to one another, but rather travels on a fluid course. She also has a purpose this time around. Her \\"destiny\\": to slay the Jabberwocky and return the throne to the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Unfortunately, because there is a mission with a deadline, Burton doesn't spend enough time examining and sharing many of these characters with us. The one's he does show off the most become annoying, with the exception of Carter's Red Queen, who is very funny and fresh. Carter is one of the most underrated actresses aroundtoday, and her performance here inspires pure delight.     Frankly, I got downright sick of Depp's Scottish, somewhat satanic Mad Hatter. He has some nice moments in his first scene, but its all downhill from there, as he descends into incoherent, unfunny silliness, that is far off the path of what the character is supposed to be. I think that it proves that Depp's subtler characters are more memorable, and more inspired, such as in 'Ed Wood' and 'Sweeney Todd.' When it comes to the pairing of Burton and Depp, there is often genius created, but not this time. This performance reminded me more of Depp's Willy Wonka, in that it stands out for all the wrong reasons, particularly the catastrophic, unthinkably out of place moment in which the Hatter dances some strange dance. I shuddered in my seat.    I wanted to see more of the blue caterpillar, which is one of the best versions I've seen thanks to Rickman's voice performance. The same goes for the Cheshire cat, I wanted more, and got less. Burton and Woolverton do explore the world in some depth, and some of the long shots of the land and of the Queen's castle are fantastic, visually. The story parallels the brilliant visuals nicely until the third act, which is filled with climactic clichés and battles with predictable finishes. As a follow up to 'Sweeney Todd', 'Alice in Wonderland' is a disappointment. Tim Burton could have really taken this material and run with it, but instead, he has settled for formula sprinkled with moments of intrigue and wonder. However, since the build up to the final third has such moments, the final sequence can be forgiven for some, not all, of its flaws. That damn dance! I just can't grasp it.     A key issue with Burton's direction and Woolverton's script is this: Carroll's Alive in Wonderland was, more or less, episodic in structure. Woolverton's idea to reconstruct the story in a traditional, linear way could perhaps work in another life. Unfortunately, in order for it to work, thecharacters would require more depth in order for them to fit into a story like Burton has created here. These are characters with shallow, episodic presence, in a film trying to tell a beginning-middle-end story. It is a major misstep that prevented this movie from being truly interesting.    *I would like to mention Crispin Glover, who plays Stayne, the Red Queen's right hand man. Glover is an actor who I've always enjoyed watching do his thing, and as usual, he is given the creepiest role in the film. It's what he's best at, and he does a knock out job delivering the line, \\"I like largeness.\\" A crucial line, and for delivering it with such precision, Mr. Glover, I salute you.
1416955070|5.0|This whole series is fully equipped with twists and turns. There are many surprises that leave you guessing. Once you think you've figured everything out, the story takes a turn. At the end of the series it is amazing how everything comes together in a way that i never would have guessed! There is a star-crossed love story, action, mystery, and light comedy. The Mortal Instruments series is definitely worth your time and money. I LOVED it! 5 stars!!

B002KGKH5A|5.0|In 2007 the Detroit duo The White Stripes  toured every Canadian province and territory to celebrate their tenth anniversary. Under Great White Northern Lights documents that tour. As Jack and Meg White reach the most remote towns in Canada, such as Whitehorse,Iqaluit and Glace Bay, it becomes clear that the indigenous people in those towns have no idea who The White Stripes are, but it is so unusual for any band to come to their town that they give Jack and Meg a warm welcome. This is an event that will be remembered all over Canada for many years.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I don't know for sure, but it's probably safe to say that the series finale of LOST is one of the most anticipated conclusion to any show, ever. Leading up to the air date of the first episode of season 6, there was a ton of press coverage, promotional trailers, posters, teaser, etc. The hype was nonstop, and the fans were salivating more than ever. Expectations were ridiculously high--much higher than they ever were for the previous 5 seasons. Season 5 left us fans with many mysteries to ponder upon, and Abrams and Lindelof promised that questions would be answered.<br /><br />Were there any answers?<br /><br />I'm going to disagree with a good portion of the reviewers here and say: Yes, yes they were. Season 6 provided a lot more closure than many fans are willing to admit.<br /><br />I'm sure a good portion of fans who are reading this review (if any at all) are already moaning, groaning and rolling their eyes, but I ask those fans to consider something: Season 6 gave an answer to the smoke monster, the man in black, the nature of Jacob, the \\"reason\\" that they were all there (c'mon, that's been argued over since Season 1), the whispers, Richard Alpert's story, the effects of the incident, the sickness that consumed Danielle's crew, the overall point of the island, the wheel that Ben used, the source of the electromagnetism and what it does, the statue of Tarawet and how most of it got destroyed, the Black Rock, the origin of the others and their reason for being there, and the temple that's been talked about since the Season 3 finale. I'm not pulling these out of thin air, either. Re-watch the season. For that matter, re-watch the whole show, and then tell me that this season didn't resolve any plot threads. And let's not forget what the previous season have answered, which is much more than fans are, once again, willing to admit. Re-watching the series from the beginning has helped me realize that there really wasn't a whole lot to clear up after the show was finished, though I admit that a few plot threads were left hanging.<br /><br />It makes me sad to see this season criticized for not fulfilling any promises, when in fact it did, but it requires memory of everything else the series has answered, as well has subtly answered. 6 was hyped up so much that many fans (including myself) put it on some unreachable pedestal, one that no TV show could ever compare to. That's just what happens in a case like this, and it's almost inevitable. Even Abrams and Lindelof seemed to be getting rather defensive when the backlash erupted.<br /><br />But forget all of that for now. Let's just focus on the show. As always, there are many powerful performances by all of the lead actors. Terry O'Quinn does an outstanding, sinister performance as the man in black that has taken on the form of the deceased John Locke. The story arc of Matthew Fox's character, Jack Shephard, finally comes full circle with realizing his true destiny and rethinking everything he's done on the island. Ben (Michael Emerson) is as deceitful and evil as ever, but even he makes some highly noticeable changes midway through the season. Hurley's ability to talk to dead people is more important than ever, Richard's faith in Jacob is taken to its limits, and the entire LOST team is, once again, divided up. As usual, the show is very entertaining with spectacular performances, plot twists, drama, and none of the characters' dialogue or actions seem out of place. I'll actually admit that I felt underwhelmed at times, but thinking through everything I saw, as well as refreshing my memory on the show, has helped me to not only appreciate the season, but to love it as I love the ones that came before it.<br /><br />However, I can't give this season the full 5 stars. Sadly, it wasn't perfect, and despite my enjoyment, there were certainly things that could have been done better. The biggest problem with Season 6 is its pacing. Too much time was spent within the temple, and muchof the time in this Egyptian maze dragged its feet, sometimes unsure of where it was going. Shoving the Dogen character down our throats and expecting us to care about him felt rather forced and unnatural. Once he was killed, it was stated  that he was the only thing keeping MIB out of the temple. Why is that? I felt they could have spent even a tad of those episodes explaining the reason for this. Surely it had something to do with Jacob assigning him the role, but it was mishandled. Watching the man in black go postal on that place was certainly a Godsend for many fans, myself included. Another portion of the show was spent on the beach just preparing for things to come, as opposed to anyone actually doing anything. It felt tired and, dare I say it, uninspired. It didn't seem smart for the show to be doing this on what is supposed to be the resolution to everything. Lastly, there is the flash-sideways timeline, or \\"alternate reality,\\" as many fans called it. The true nature of this story line isn't understood until the very last few minutes of the finale. After much thinking and processing, it certainly helps make this side of the story a lot more enjoyable and even relevant (much more relevant than many fans say it is), it doesn't help the previous episodes that they waited entirely too long to explain it. And the two \\"realities\\" don't even begin to connect until the 11th episode, with only 6 more to go. It was difficult for many fans to grasp the point and relevance of this reality, though I don't mean to suggest that too many fans simply have low intellects. The MIB and Jacob-centric episode \\"Across the Sea\\" was not as epic and incredible as it could have and certainly had the right to have been. Some parts felt anticlimactic. However, I'm on the side of fans that really liked this episode, and it gave closure to a lot more things than most fans say it did (are you noticing a trend here?).<br /><br />I'll stop with the criticisms because I feel I'm representing my opinion as being a lot more negative than it actually is (it's actually quite positive). Season 6 was very well done, despite a few shortcomings. The episode that I have to give special note to is the finale, otherwise known as \\"The End.\\" What can I say? I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I watched in awe, and my heart was warmed more than it ever had been by the show. The \\"light\\" that the protector of the island is meant to protect seems to be a highly symbolic sort of plot device. I'll admit that I'm still trying to figure it out, but it certainly helps answer what the role of Jacob was, and what the role of anyone who is assigned the protector is. I can say without a doubt that the \\"alternate reality\\" is certainly connected to this light, and part of why it is so necessary to keep it safe. Some fans saw this as a cop-out, along with the AR, but I argue that it fits in with the show as well as everything else we've seen, if you give it a little thought.<br /><br />Out of all the answers that fans deny that Season 6 gave, no fan can argue that it gave a successful conclusion to each characters' story arc. Watching them evolve over so many episodes has been highly rewarding, and watching them find redemption is easily one of the best and most beautiful scenes of the entire show. I don't feel cheated whatsoever by the ending, and I don't think I would have it end any other way. I applaud the writers and producers for taking such a big risk for the end of their money maker. A new storytelling device and theme is given to each season, and season 6 was no different. It was risky, and they probably knew that some fans would be disappointed, but they created an extremely rewarding experience for this fan and many others. If you're a fan that's been following the show, you owe it to yourself to give this final piece of the puzzle a chance to fit in with the others.feet, sometimes unsure of where it was going.

This is a brilliant, heartwarming (and at some times for a interesting reason, sad) film that will stay with you even after it's done and it also makes you think about certain things in life, especially childhood memories. This is a impressive-looking film, especially in 3D. Disney & Pixar have done it again,brilliantly, with this film. This is just as brilliant as the first two \\"Toy Story\\" films. This is the best movie of the summer and of the year, so far, by far. An Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature & Best Original Song.
0800141849|1.0|\\"The Mirror Has Two Faces\\" is one of Streisand's less interesting efforts, memorable primarily for her scenes with Oscar-nominated Lauren Bacall. But the low rating is for the product itself: This is a cheaply made pan-and-scan edition; it does NOT feature a widescreen version per Amazon's description.
B000W93CXQ|3.0|I was at my local bookstore one day when I found this book sitting on a shelf. It looked very interesting, so I bought it, thinking I would devour it in one sitting like I do with most all my books. I did read it all, and I really tried to enjoy it, but I just couldn't get in to it like everyone else could. It's strange, though. Usually, the books like this one are my favorites. But this one, I'm sorry but I didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else did.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a top notch adaptation of an often overlooked British author that had wonderful social commentary about the time of the industrial revolution in Northern England set amidst a Victorian style drama with romantic inclinations.  The actors are very good. The cinematography is stellar. Richard Armitage's portrayal of John's restrained passionate nature is stirring.  I was fascinated every minute he was on screen.  Brendan Coyle as wonderfully intuitive (when it comes to Margaret) Higgins was a joy;  I loved that the blue collar wrker union guy single father with grown children from the wrong side of the tracks that understood the privileged young girl (Margaret) better than any other character.  Sinead Cusack as Mrs. Thornton is a scene stealer. Daniela Denby-Ashe does a good job portraying Margaret's conflict as a somewhat privileged girl that tries to be a lady and fit societal expectations at the same time has steel in her spine, decided opinions, and a sense of social justice. Mrs. Thornton and Margaret are both made of the same stuff.  The series script deviates from the book by Elizabeth Glaskell, but stays true to the basic story and feel, and in my mind improves on the book in condensing so much of the trivial meanderings in the book.  One of the things I find most glorious that it never takes sides in the labor disputes, it shows both sides, two groups, dependent on each other for survival. This female author while employing the strong taciturn type male lead, is incredibly kind to men in a repressive age, creates admirable male characters.  They are loyal, and loving, and strong, and have ethics, and they do what they do for their families, and for what they believe is right.  And when they are wrong, they say they are wrong. For me, the only fault I find in it is the amount of time it spent on Boucher's character.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I have one word about this book: stunning. This novel was so amazing, I literally would not stop reading until the end. It reminded me vaguely of Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, but with more music and love story. Add this book to your must-read list and save room on the bookshelf.   10/10
B001GM28HO|4.0|There's one thing I've said for quite some time, and that's that I would never jump on the GaGa bandwagon. Unfortunately, I lied.    Overall, this is a very strange thing for me, because I'm one of those individuals that generally shy away from pop and radio music. I listen to a lot of different genres, ranging from folk, to gothic (rock), to various forms of metal, to shoegaze, classical and beyond -- but this isn't something that would typically fall into my line of sight. Despite this, and for whatever reason -- GaGa had been stalking me to the point of annoyance -- so I decided to act on that annoyance. I checked out \\"The Fame\\". Upon first listen, I was expecting a boring, typical, manufactured, bubble-gum pop album..but what I got was quite different, and actually, quite interesting.    To start, I'll say that Lady GaGa is more than what meets the eye on first contact. Firstly, she writes her own music, and even has a hand in the production of her own albums. Second, many of her songs have deeper, hidden meanings. Third, she's vocally talented. And fourth, she's crazy and takes chances (well, we all know she's strange..right?). Beyond that, she's everything a pop artist should be. She pushes buttons. She gets people talking. Her songs are catchy and whether you like them or not, they stick in your head. Yes, she's all that.    While I could go over every song, I won't..but I will mention a few of the stand-outs.     First, there's the title track \\"The Fame,\\"  which is an interesting throwback to the 80s. The lyrics are well enough and fit the concept of the album as a whole. The vocals are excellent, and it has a hook that could even make my 90 year old grandma get up and dance. This song was a blast from the past, and I loved it.    Then there's \\"Paparazzi,\\" which I'm sure everyone has heard by now. I enjoy the song not only because it's catchy as hell, but because the lyrics can actually be interpreted in various ways. While many feel the song is about a typical groupie fan stalking a band/artist..I take the song as the artist actually stalking the Paparazzi. Not necessarily literally, but metaphorically, as in doing everything possible to achieve fame -- to achieve popularity, success, and to be noticed. Instead of the Paparazzi being her fan, she's theirs. She longs for their attention, for the fame. It makes me think of the celebrities that actually (and they really do) call the Paparrazi and tip them off on where they'll be, simply so they can drown in the media frenzy.     Then there's \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich,\\" \\"Money Honey,\\"  and \\"I Like it Rough,\\" all of which stay true to the concept of the album, and are as catchy and engaging as ever. Most surprisingly however, are the songs \\"Brown Eyes,\\" and \\"Summerboy.\\" Brown Eyes is a gaga-esque ballad; an emotional piano/beat driven piece about a lost love. This is perhaps one of GaGa's most deep songs, which is not only shown lyrically, but through her emotional and hard-hitting vocals. Summerboy isn't exactly as deep, but just as interesting. Perhaps most interesting about the track, is the style and vocals. Reminiscent of very early 'No Doubt', this is a quirky, funky pop-song about a simple summer romance; one in which GaGa is *unsurprisingly* in complete in control of. It's just a great song.    With that said, Lady GaGa's \\"The Fame,\\" is a surprisingly solid, fun, and unique piece of pop music. I can see her having true longevity as a star -- and if she keeps up with her wacky outfits, mind-numbingly catchy songs, and controversial music videos and behavior, her obvious plan of world domination should come to pass. In truth, I don't see her going away any time soon -- and with her latest release of \\"The Fame Monster,\\" she has proved once again that she has what it takes.     All in all, I'll say this: if you like her songs, even guiltily, take a look at \\"The Fame,\\" you may be pleasantly surprised. GaGa has it all..Vocal talent (youtube her live version of speechless if you don't believe me), dance talent, writing talent, and most important, she just has \\"it.\\" In a world of bland and boring pop singers and music -- gaga takes it a different level, creating dancy, catchy, unique, and even controversial music that's simply easy to enjoy. Overall, \\"The Fame\\" is a fun album, and if taken for what it is, can be quite a surprise.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|All ask for in these type of movies is 4 things. Stuff blows up. Comedic lines are given. The characters are great. The movie is consistently entertaining. The Losers has a hard time living up to these standards. Stuff does blow up, but except for one or two scenes, they don't really have the impact you want. Comedic lines are given. A character is good. And the film lags dearly between all the action. On these aspect, the film mostly fails, but overall, it's entertaining enough. Let's expand on these points, shall we?<br /><br />Stuff Blows Up: By far the most memorable scene is where a motorcycle does an awesome crash into an airplane, and it blows up, and Jeffrey Dean Morgon walks away from it, because let's face it, cool people don't look at explosions. And while the rest of the action isn't as memorable, it still kept me entertained while watching the film.<br /><br />Comedic Lines Are Given: If anything, this film will renew your love for Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believing.\\" Most of the jokes comes from Chris Evans character, but the others on the team do their share of one-liners & amusing dialogues as well. If Jason Patric's character is anything, he's unintentionally funny. How evil is he? He shoots a woman for not holding his umbrella right. I found that amusing. But I'm also a dark and disturbing person apparently.<br /><br />The Characters Are Great: Chris Evans has had a very long streak now of being the best thing in every movie he's ever been in, and this continues in full-force for the Losers. I suppose he actually has a skill, but the movie mostly turns to him for laughs. A sequence in a building featuring Evans caused uproarious laughter in my theater, and other scenes featuring Evans are also great. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a cool dude, but not a specifically memorable character. Same with the rest of them. They all have their traits, but none except for Evans really stick with you.<br /><br />The Movie is Consistently Entertaining: Here's the problem with movies like these. They have to keep up a great pace so the audience isn't really thinking about what's not happening at this very moment. Why? Because they start asking questions about plot holes, or \\"Why are these characters even here?\\" The space between action may not be as long as I may make it out to be, but the film could have been more easily paced. I could also discuss plot, but hey, are you really watching this movie for plot?<br /><br />Overall, The Losers will make for a good matinee or rental, but not much more. I know it's kind of a mindless action film, but there's just not enough substance here. Plus, if you have the choice between this & the new A-Team movie with Liam Neeson, there really isn't a choice. The A-Team blows The Losers out of the park. No, watch The Losers for some decent action sequences and Chris Evans. There's no Win-Win situation here. Everything just ends with the word \\"Lose.\\"e to keep up a great pace so the audience isn't really thinking about what's not happening at this very moment. Why?

B003PGNBO8|5.0|Flashforward was the show to replace LOST. The networks promoted it as such and some of us even believed it could be as good as the television greatness benchmark. I never thought that it would replace LOST, but I had hoped it would fill the void after LOST went into the great beyond. The show from the start was disappointing. It was never bad just not up to the level of greatness that ABC had promoted it as. The story took a little long to develope and the characters themselves lacked depth for far too long. As the show reached it's hiatus though the stories and characters really kicked into gear. The plot twists we expected from the show finally started to appear. As the show entered hiatus it was really on a roll, and when it came back four months later it really amped up the action with amazing episodes. Some of the stories in the show never really interested me. Like Aaron and his dead daughter. It always seemed seperated from the central mythos and Aaron and Tracy themselves always seemed like they should have been left on the cutting room floor. Thankfully this deadly duo didn't recieve alot of screen time throughout the series and I was greatful. The actors themselves did a great job. They never missed a beat. Dominic Monoughan joining the cast after a few episodes was a welcome treat and was the real start of the story picking up.     When Simon is introduced to the plot another side of the story is revealed. You finally start to see who was behind the blackout, but never to my satisfaction do you find out why they did it. There were some clues that Mark obtained that never seemed to pan out to real revelations, but I can assume that they would have been important to the plot had the show continued. The love triangle between Mark, Olivia, and Lloyd is very well done. Mark is the main character and he has to choose between saving the world and saving his marriage. Olivia Mark's wife sees herself with Lloyd in her flashforward. Though she is loyal to her husband it soon becomes apparent that the universe has other things in store. Mark has to try and maintain his life at home while trying to unravel the mysteries behind the global blackout. It adds a great depth and vulnerability to the protagonist. Another interesting plot is Mark's partner Domitri who saw nothing when he blacked out. He soon finds out that if you saw no future you will be dead by April 29th. It's really cool to see how this character deals with his mortality. The main plot and question to the series is the most interesting. Can the future be changed? How these characters fight the future or make sure it comes true is an interesting window into how these characters think and feel about their lives and who they really are.     The show in the first few episodes was centered more on the overall plot of the blackout and less on the characters and their development. After a few episodes though they complimented themselves nicely and I started to really care about these people. As the series continued it added more character centric episodes that explained each character through flashbacks of their time before the blackout, or during it. This really helped the series to delve into what makes these characters tick and the series was way better for it. The show does have a sci fi element to it, but that shouldn't scare anyone away from this astounding series. The characters themselves root the plot in reality as they struggle to fight the future. A bit of a warning to those that buy this series on DVD or Blu Ray the show does not have a tidy ending. The final episode was shot as a season finale so there is a cliffhangar. It's nothing too serious and you can create your own ending based on what you learn, but it sure does leave you begging for more. This series ultimatly failed to capture the imagination of the audience and that is a shame. It may have been chosen as the sucessor to LOST, but what can really live up to that hype. Flashforward turned into one of the more enjoyable series this year, but unfortunatly there was no one left watching to experience it. I recommend it to fans of the serialized dramas like LOST or Fringe as it is a unique story thats worth your time.

030745455X|5.0|All this buzz is swirling around about Stieg Larsson and his Millenium series.  Not going into the details of how or why it's so popular, I can comment and review the books themselves.  Having read the first one, and believing it to be a pretty good thriller, I found the second one on Amazon and decided to give it a go.  Whereas in the first one I found the plot to be interesting and rather titillating I felt that it was missing something.  Sure Blomkvist was a likable hero and his journey to uncover a family mystery was interesting to read.  It was perhaps Larson's creation of Lisbeth Salander that really got me interested in the book.  She is one of the most exciting characters to come along in a while possessing similarities of Lara Croft, 007, Jason Bourne and a whole slew of other action heroes.  She made the first book exciting, but I still felt the first one lacked something, or maybe I was just let down that it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.  The second one, however, packed a punch that left me craving to read it at work, at school, and deep in the night.  What makes the second one so good is the slow unraveling of Lisbeth Salander.  In the second one we find her a changed person from the first novel.  In The Girl Who Played with Fire she is a lot more grown up and the mysteries that surrounded her in the first novel begin to reveal themselves.  My pulse was pounding to find out what was going to happen next.  I also felt the character development was solid.  All our old friends from the first one our back and each is given their own time to reveal themselves.  The plot I also felt was stronger in The Girl Who Played with Fire.  Trying to sum up this story to a friend is difficult because the plot is so tightly bound with mysteries being uncovered left and right.  It's a thrilling murder mystery, family drama, government cover up, and feminist fable of power.  I highly recommend this novel and look forward to the third one.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I have seasons 1 and 2 and I am eagerly awaiting the release of season 3.  Chuck is a blend of drama and comedy, the chemistry between Chuck and Sara sizzles and fans eagerly await their getting together.  Season 3 does not disappoint.  Chuck's writers carefully build this season to the finale of the first 13 episodes, then we are treated to an additional 6 which are actually the best.  I love all of the characters in this show and it is one of my all time favorites.  It features an average geek who becomes a super spy.  Zachary Levi is \\"awesome\\" in the role.  If you like action, comedy and romance Chuck is for you.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|I have seen 22 movies in theaters so far this year, but out of that bunch, only Toy Story 3 deserves a 5 star rating. Yeah, it's really been a lackluster year.<br /><br />The animation and voice acting are top notch as always, but Pixar never fails in the most important part of a movie, the script. Sure a movie can look pretty and all, but it's the writing that has always elevated Pixar above other animation studios. How to Train Your Dragon was a very good effort from Dreamworks this year, but watching Toy Story 3 today just confirmed how far they still have to go.<br /><br />I will agree with the claim that most critics are making by saying that this is one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Other than the first three films of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Lord of the Rings, I can't think of any others more consistently great. Toy Story 3 is just as good as 1 and 2, but it goes into some darker territory than the previous two, so much so, I would say this is geared more for adults than kids. Don't let that fool you, there are more than enough clever lines and visual gags to keep you laughting, as well as, some great action sequences. I loved the whole prison break out of the daycare part, and the last five minutes or so couldn't have been any more perfect, leaving you wiping away happy and sad tears at the same time.<br /><br />In the end, we are left with a beautifully wrapped up conclusion to a series of movies that will be treasured for infinity and beyond.<br /><br />I didn't see the movie in 3-D since I heard it wasn't worth the extra money. Judging from the trailers I saw before the movie started, everyone is rushing to tack on 3-D at the last minute. Only Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon had the impact of actually being filmed that way to begin with.
1584282584|5.0|Neil is an experienced and very competent wedding photographer. This book covers techniques and lessons learned over hundreds of weddings and will save the beginning photographer a lot of time. It will also save them money they might otherwise spend on flash modifying gadgets that waste not only money but precious light from the flash.     Most wedding photography books try to cover everything and as a result provide little in the way of practical advice and information on how to take the pictures and how to use flash most effectively. This book by covering only on-camera flash provides information you can start using immediately to get better pictures. If you are one the many people who are intimidated by flash and by default have become an available light photographer (W. Eugene Smith made the great comment that he used available light, which meant any light that was available and of course that would include flash) this book will get you started.    Even the amateur photographer who photographs family and friends or takes their camera on their travels will find a lot of useful information in Neil's book. It is one of very few wedding photography oriented books that I would not hesitate to recommend.
B002ZG982S|2.0|I knew before sitting down in the theater today that this movie is getting nothing but trashed all over the place by critics, but I always go in with an open mind and usually end up disagreeing with them. Well, that's not the case here. First off, the movie is only 72 minutes long if you take away the end credits. They spent no time developing any of the characters, so I never really cared about any of them. Maybe a director's cut will be released on DVD, because this movie really needed another 30 minutes.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is a fine actor and he is the best thing about the movie, but even he seems a little bored with the whole thing at times. He does get some good one-liners along the way. John Malkovich is just here for a paycheck. Talk about a villain that will put you to sleep. His whole evil plan has been done a million times before. We all know Megan Fox looks great, but can she act? The answer is still no. She's not too bad here, especially when compared with her previous work, but her character is really unnecessary. It also seemed like they enhanced her face with some CGI touch up in certain scenes, as if to make her best asset even more flawless.<br /><br />The CGI is okay, the music is way too in your face, and the story leaves a lot to be desired, but Jonah Hex doesn't fall into the abysmal territory of The Wild Wild West. It at least has some relatively fun sequences. It's just too silly, even though it takes itself way too seriously. Does that make sense? Probably about as much sense as strapping two gatling guns to the sides of your horse, only to never see them again after they worked so well in the opening shootout. I guess the horse tired of lugging them around. Oh, and how stupid were those dynamite crossbows?

B000069HZP|4.0|If you look up \\"Forgotten Gem\\" in the dictionary you'll see the poster for this film.    The Game is an excellent movie! And yet it came and went from theaters in a heartbeat, falling through the cracks of obscurity in the process. How? Why? Well, those are even more mysteries for this twisty-turny film. And twists and turns abound in The Game.    It's well acted, well-filmed, well-written... what more could anyone want from a movie?    Well, a partial answer to that would be a deluxe DVD edition or, heaven forbid, a blu-ray release! I've only ever seen old, bare bones releases of the film. While a turkey like Alien 3 get the deluxe treatment as well as infinitely better films (than Alien 3) like Seven and Fight Club have had multiple releases, I can't understand why The Game is stuck with, really, a lousy DVD release.    The film deserves better. Much better. I'd advise getting your hands on this movie as fast as you can whether it be a cheap copy or a rental. It is truly a great thriller. I've got my fingers crossed we'll see a decent DVD release of this lost Fincher.    The Game is one for the ages!
B003EYVXVY|5.0|When I saw this in the theater I knew that it had set a new standard for special effects. It was simply beautiful. The 3D component was remarkable, there were times during the jungle scenes where I wanted to swat bugs and floating bits out of my face, haha. I can't wait for the 3D Blu-Ray version to hit the shelves!
0670020745|5.0|I bought this book after seeing Jill's talk on her amazing experience and recovery from the stroke.  What a determined woman!

B0015DYIH2|1.0|The first three books were nothing special, but I don't have the words to communicate how bad Breaking Dawn was. For one thing, the heroine is a whiny do-nothing moron. She complains that her boyfriend buys her insanely expensive sports cars and we're expected to RELATE to her!? Another thing is that the plot has more holes than the I-55 in Louisiana. Spoilers from here on.    Part one, we join Bella before her wedding, whining about how everyone is staring at her new Mercedes (which isn't even available in America). Everything from there is just boring. Edward gets her pregnant, which shouldn't even be possible, him being basically a talking corpse. And despite the fact that Bella doesn't even like kids, she decides to keep the mutant that's killing her.  And then Edward asks Jacob to make a deal with Bella: she forgets the mutant and has kids with Jacob instead. I hope I don't have to explain how creepy that is.    The scene where Bella is giving birth is just disturbing. Edward tears open Bella's stomach with his teeth, right after she breaks her spine. And to add to the tone of horror, it's a baby girl named RENESMEE with chocolate-brown eyes (because that particular description isn't overused enough). I'm pretty sure that naming your kid that is a form of child abuse.    In the end, Jacob's secret is revealed: he's  a pedophile. He imprints on Bella's baby, now nicknamed &#34;Nessies.&#34; Yes, like the Loch Ness Monster.    The scene where the Cullens and their allies face off against the Volutri is just stupid. I was anticipating throats ripped out and the grass underfoot stained with blood. Instead, they have a nice, friendly chat and are then off on their way. Bella's power actually made me laugh: she has a mental shield to surround everyone she cares about with a bubble of love, thus protecting them from the meanie vampires trying to torture them. And then the book ends. Don't waste your money or your time. Invent your own ending, preferably one where Bella gets pushed off a thirty story building.
0807014273|5.0|I came to this book in a round-about way - it was recommended in the book [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]] in the chapter on \\"Meaning\\". In \\"A Whole New Mind\\" the author, Daniel Pink, has come up with six senses that are important to develop one's mind in a Conceptual Age and \\"meaning\\" is one of the them. The idea that we have to read a book to realize that we have to develop meaning in our lives seems pathetic. But nevertheless, I was intrigued by Pink's description of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" and read it immediately after reading \\"A Whole New Mind\\". Surprisingly I had never heard of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" nor its author Victor Frankl even though its afterword states that it has sold 12 million copies in 24 languages and in a 1991 \\"Book of the Month\\" survey was voted among the 10 most influential books by readers.<br /><br />The book is the story of Frankl's experience as a prisoner in various concentration camps during World War II. Before being arrested, he was working on a manuscript about his psychological theories (he had been a practicing psychiatrist in Vienna). Though his wife sewed the manuscript in his coat, it was soon confiscated in the camp; he proceeded to practice his theory of searching for meaning despite his bleak situation and he also tried to recreate the manuscript on scraps of paper. Despite the grim and horrible scenes described by Frankl, you will be amazed by his outlook on life and how he just kept going. There is no doubt that his survival was aided by his firm belief in the importance of finding meaning in life (in ANY situation). He was also lucky and resourceful. When he was liberated from camp, he wrote the entire book in 9 days.<br /><br />At the end of the book is an essay on his theory of logotherapy which is a very practical outlook on addressing many psychological problems. He states that \\"man's main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.\\" He says that life has no inherent meaning but rather a unique meaning exists for each person which he has a responsibility to discover. The meaning can be discovered in 3 ways:<br />1) By creating a work or doing a deed<br />2) By experiencing something or encountering someone<br />3) By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering (though suffering is NOT a prerequisite for discovering meaning)<br />His theory is much more than a theory since it was so effectively put into practice by him and the people he counseled. His theory is given much more weight by his life story (he lost both his parents and his pregnant wife in the camps). This is a short book that bears reading multiple times.ays that life has no inherent meaning but rather a unique meaning exists for each person which he has a responsibility to discover.

B0006L0LOS|5.0|I have always liked the Catwoman character. I remember watching the old Batman & Robin shows-(does that date me?)I loved Eartha Kit, but thought Julie Newmar was great too.  Halle Berry takes Catwoman to a whole new level. She studied cats so much that in the movie you believe that she is a Cat Woman! She plays it so realistically, if I can say that and make sense. She moves just like I've watched my cats. They own the world, don't take commands unless they want to and are sweet and playful when they are in the mood.  Ms. Berry puts a LOT of sensuality into her version that it looks like there has never been another. Of course, you have to remember that, not only is this a movie, or a TV show, but that this is a much later time in cinema than they were allowed to do even in movies. With that liberty, Berry takes it to the limit and past it!  I could hardly believe that she or anyone else could move like that (outside of a 'Gentleman's Club.\\"  She is perfect and the movie itself is really interesting. It's well done and keeps you glued to the screen. I wish that I'd watched in on the silver screen-I bet that was mind blowing. Guess I'll just have to wait until I can afford a gigantic screen.  Definitely worth seeing and well worth it to buy-that was you will always have this great movie on tap.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I've read a few of the negative reviews about this movie and I can understand where they're coming from; yes, it's kind of hokey and no, it's not \\"pure\\" Austen . . . this is where the \\"but\\" comes in.      The main appeal is that it speaks to a secret fantasy of what would happen if YOU could enter \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"?  Jane Austen's work is so finely crafted that it seems impossible that society doesn't exist.  Surely you could actually be there, you must be able to step into Longbourn and meet the Bennet family.  So when this movie depicts that very thing of going back in time and reality, it gives you permission to explore the idea.  What if you could gaze into Darcy's eyes and hear his voice?  What would you say, how would you react??  What about trading places with Lizzy Bennet??      Does my fantasy correlate with the events of the movie?  Of course not.  BUT it's still fun, if you're willing to overlook the flaws and just have a little \\"chick flick\\" fun.  Add a glass of your favorite wine, if necessary.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I can hardly believe it, but this is the DEVO album I've been waiting for since 1984's \\"Shout\\". Sure, the pre-released songs \\"Fresh\\" and \\"Don't Shoot, I'm a Man\\" sounded incredibly promising, but could we really hope for a full album of solid tunes from a band that hasn't recorded anything for twenty years? Well, by Booji Boy, we could. It's almost as if the bland \\"Total Devo\\" and tepid \\"Smooth Noodle Maps\\" never happened. This album will rock your Energy Dome.<br /><br />True, they seem to have mined their own back catalog, lifted some familiar hooks and retro-synth sounds and revved them up to carry this album forward, but who cares? \\"Something for Everybody\\" is a blast...and I dare you to not tap your toes to almost every track. These tunes are like a good old fashioned soundtrack for de-evolution. Wherever General Boy is now, he must be proud.<br /><br />\\"Feedin' and breedin' and pumpin' gas. Cheeseburger, cheeseburger, do it again.\\" Classic.
1416972242|4.0|Valentine is back and killing Downworlders in the very first chapter of City of Ashes. The quick pace continues throughout the entire book, taking you an a entertaining and lightning fast ride.<br /><br />City of Bones set up the premise and City of Ashes continues the story well, but don't expect many answers from this book. If anything, I was left with many more questions at the end of the book than when I started it. The second mortal instrument is introduced, many die and we get a great introduction to the fairy world.<br /><br />While Valentine is wreaking havoc and Clary's mom remains in her magical coma, a large amount of progress is made in the personal and romantic lives of the teens. Jace deals with Valentine again, Clary deals with Jace and Simon, Simon deals with major, life changing events and even Alec starts dealing with his internal issues. There was a very good balance between the dangerous action and the private lives of characters in this book.<br /><br />Luke opens up a lot in City of Ashes and I thought the idea of him facing the past when it comes to the Lightwoods and especially relating his feelings about the past to Clary were the absolute best part of the book. Even though he isn't a main character, he's quickly becoming one of my favorites.<br /><br />City of Ashes may not provide much in the way of resolution but it's an extremely good follow up to City of Bones and not to be missed. The Mortal Instruments is getting more and more addictive.
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|Fortunately Robert Smith did not commit suicide as other lesser \\"artists\\" have done in the past and had become so popular as of late. Often when pop stars become rich and famous, they yearn for the days when they slept on second hand stained mattresses, ate rotten food, did not practice normal hygiene, and got stoned (literally and figuratively) at concerts. This usually leads to poor choices in their craft and career, and they end up being famous for being infamous, but little else. After the money's gone and their new home is the gutter, they start the process all over again as being down and out but resourceful leads to fame and riches, but hollow... Very similar to economic expansions and contractions with the exception that bankers should commit suicide more often but do not. In any case, the remastering of the album is a welcome addition to all Cure fans, even the ones who hate remasters as they prefer to stick to their tinny 1989 CDs to combat the \\"loudness war\\" disregarding the proven fact that it took Elektra/WB over 20 years to give this album the respect it deserves. And as to whether vynil sounds \\"warmer\\" and \\"truer\\" to the intended sound, while that argument may have had its merits THEN, it no longer does NOW after the master recordings have been given the 24-bit treatment.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I've been on hiatus from fantasy lately...only because most of my favorite authors can't seem to finish what they started.  After spending the last 5 years waiting for George R. R. Martin to pen A Dance With Dragons, Patrick Rothfuss to publish The Wise Man's Fear, or Scott Lynch to close out Locke Lamora's adventures, I figured I'd look for something that was actually complete.  The positive reviews for Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy -- which, by the way is completely written and published! -- helped to convince me to give this series a chance.  I couldn't be happier that I did.    Plenty of other reviews detail the inventive magic system that Sanderson created, and so no need to go into detail there.  Sanderson created a set of characters that were likable and believable, and he has a gift for fun dialogue and captivating action sequences.  I was hooked by Chapter 2 when Dockson and Kelsier chatted on the walls of Luthadel:    \\"Ah,\\" Dockson said.  \\"So you did have something to do with Lord Tresting's death.\\"    Kelsier smiled.  \\"You could say that.\\"    \\"His murder caused quite a stir among the local nobility.\\"    \\"That was kind of the intention,\\" Kelsier said.  \\"Though, to be honest, I wasn't planning anything quite so dramatic.  It was almost more of an accident than anything else.\\"    Dockson raise an eyebrow.  \\"How do you 'accidentally' kill a nobleman in his own mansion?\\"    \\"With a knife in the chest,\\" Kelsier said lightly.  \\"Or, rather, a pair of knives in the chest--it always pays to be careful.\\"    Dockson rolled his eyes.      Witty dialogue, an inventive magic system, and a well thought-out story make Mistborn: the Final Empire one of the better fantasy books I've read in years.  Pick it up -- you won't be disappointed.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Alone is a non-stop ride of pulse-pounding action. From the minute Bobby pulls the trigger up until the very last page, Alone will keep you guessing and turning pages. Gardner is also very skilled in portraying her characters in a lifelike fashion. None of them are truly heroes and none of them (except for Catherine's rapist) are truly bad guys. She gives us someone to root for, Bobby Dodge, and plenty of other characters to try to figure out. The most intriguing character is Catherine Gagnon, who Gardner never labels and leaves it up to the reader to make a decision on.    Alone provides readers with an interesting and tricky plot and also gives them the perfect characters to play it all out. This book is recommended to anyone who enjoys thrillers or mysteries.
B00006879E|4.0|In the early part of the 21st century, it seemed like Boy Bands and electronic beats dominated the American music landscape. When Maroon 5 burst on the scene with their debut album \\"Songs About Jane\\" in 2003, it was like a breath of fresh air. Here was a group that combined R&B, funk, and rock and roll in a way that was previously unknown (at least on a grand scale) on US airwaves. Seven years on, the record still holds up as fresh music.    There's no doubt that \\"Songs About Jane\\" is a summer record. From beginning to end, it evokes images of hot, sticky summer weather. Lead track 'Harder to Breathe' is highly addictive funk, though the song itself is relatively simple. 'This Love' has more of a R&B beat, while 'Tangled' is more reminiscent of something Motown would have released back in the 1970s. There is a definite nod to the past throughout the entire album, but with enough modernity to aviod being kitsch.    For me, the first eight tracks are spectacular, especially the surprising 'She Will Be Loved', which takes the band into a slightly softer feel. Final track 'Sweetest Goodbye' is also charming, almost sounding like something by Uncle Kracker. However, the second part of the record is a bit boring. There are plenty of people who will probably argue with me on this, but it simply isn't my cup of tea.     Overall, \\"Songs About Jane\\" has, for me, withstood the test of time as a great summer album. A little funk, a little rock, a little blues, and a great combination of music.
B00275EHJG|5.0|\\"Toy Story\\" was about sibling rivalry. \\"Toy Story 2\\" was about loving others, even if it means you might get hurt someday.<br /><br />So what is \\"Toy Story 3\\" about? It takes the whole \\"kids + loyal toys\\" theme to its natural conclusion, by showing us what happens when the kids grow up and leave. While the first two-thirds of the movie are fairly pedestrian (for a Pixar movie!), the last part is both action-packed and emotionally wrenching.<br /><br />Ten years have passed, and Andy is now a college-bound teenager.  His toys are anxious about what's going to happen, so Woody keeps assuring them that they'll be put safely in the attic. But a misunderstanding leads to a date with the garbage truck. Since the toys believe they have been abandoned, they jump into the box of donated toys bound for Sunnyside Daycare.<br /><br />They're greeted by the genial Lots-o'-Hugging Bear (aka Lotso) and the friendly daycare toys, and all seems to be well. But Andy's toys soon discover that Sunnyside is a nighmare -- they've been assigned the \\"Caterpillar Room\\" for wild abusive toddlers, and Lotso is the Godfatheresque overlord of the daycare. Once Woody learns the true horrors of Sunnyside, he must infiltrate the daycare and somehow get his friends out.<br /><br />You know that the movie industry is officially in a slump when the cleverest, funniest and most touching movie of the summer... is a CGI sequel about toys. \\"Toy Story 3\\" starts off rather lightweight at first, with the toys being brought into Sunnyside and Woody setting off in another direction.<br /><br />But once Lotso is revealed as the villain, the movie takes a sharp turn -- it becomes a clever, complex \\"Great Escape\\"-style caper, with some moments of G-rated horror (THE MONKEY!) and hilarity (resetting Buzz ends up turning him into a flamenco-dancing suave Spaniard). And while the toys' attempted escape from Sunnyside is taut and genuinely thrilling, it's only the START of the climax -- a harrowing, genuinely scary chase scene that brings the toys together.<br /><br />And there's a bittersweet core to \\"Toy Story 3\\": kids grow up, leave home and the people/toys they leave behind are both proud and sad. In the final scenes of the movie,we're quietly ushered through the emotional goodbyes and hellos of growing up.<br /><br />And the adorable little cast of toys still remind us that what matters most is love and loyalty, particularly during a deadly crisis where they all fearfully join hands (it sounds sappy, but it isn't). There's also some endearing additions to the cast -- the foppish clotheshorse Ken, Big Baby, a Totoro, a giggly tricerotops, and the Shakespearean stuffed hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants.<br /><br />It hurts to say goodbye to Woody, Buzz and their friends, but \\"Toy Story 3\\" is a fitting farewell that brings the trilogy full circle.

B0035J6TAI|1.0|Peter Garbiel sounds like the old man he is. He has taken wonderful material and turned it into mush. His repeated failure to hit notes is an affectation that lacks the charm he supposes. There is a universe of better music to buy than this.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|This film is so complex, so different, so out of the norm that in order to objectively rate it, this viewer must ask: What if the movie did not have Daniel Day-Lewis in it? You see, this is a case where the actor so dominates the material that he makes it entirely his own. This is not to imply that he upstages or \\"steals\\" scenes--he doesn't have to. What I suggest is that it is basically a stunning one man tour de force and other characters are only in it to fill in certain scenes--and the thing about that is that's how Day-Lewis' character in the movie sees & relates to the other people around him. They are there to exploit one way or the other. [I also don't what to suggest that the other cast members aren't up to snuff, they are. You'd have to be very good in order to have the confidence to play opposite Day-Lewis.]<br /><br />This is a very dark fable about patriarchal capitalism in the early days of the 20th century, but it does not make polemical statements. That is, it's intention is not polemical, it's neither leftist or any way political. Some reviwers complained that there was no clear cut story line or coherence between scenes. I can see what they're saying, but I don't fully agree with them. True, there is a sort of a cinematic meandering in places, but then it's filled in with interesting cinemaphotography. More then this, the film's development is cyclical rather than linear, allegorical rather than literal. It is the only feminine presence in this almost exclusive male world based on image, power & domination.<br /><br />So what if...?<br /><br />To imagine this movie without the great actor is really inconceiveable. He IS the film. It's not often today that an American audience has the opportunity to see really great--like inspirational--acting. Day-Lewis has been compared to Olivier and it's fully deserved. The movie is interesting--even shocking--in its' own right, but Day-Lewis makes it a happening.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0783227906 In the Name of the Father]]<br />[[ASIN:B00013F2S6 The Crucible]]<br />[[ASIN:B00008L3RY My Left Foot (Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00008L3RY My Left Foot (Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00003CX8S The Age of Innocence]]Crucible]]  [[ASIN:B00008L3RY My Left Foot (Special Edition)]]  [[ASIN:B00008L3RY My Left Foot (Special Edition)]]  [[ASIN:B00003CX8S The Age of Innocence]]
B003A4IFGY|5.0|This album is terrific.  Many great songs in different genres - there is rock, r&b, acoustic, country, and even reggae!  It has a different feel to it... seems to be less digital - sort of like a LP feel to it.     I've been a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers fan since my high school days.  Bought the debut album with my lawnmowing money and loved American Girl and Breakdown.  Saw him perform these live in 1979 in a small auditorium - awesome.  I was able to see him 3 other times live after that - every one of them great.  Good to see them continuing to make great music and trying new types of songs.
0307454541|3.0|I was looking forward to this trilogy with all its hype, until I read an article which talked about the ubiquitous depiction of female victims of violence and mutilation in literature and film.  The author of the article was reviewing the  film \\"The Killer In Me\\" but mentioned TGWTDT (the movie) in passing (at the time, I had no idea what the book was about).<br /><br />There's a certain voyeuristic pleasure we get from watching killers kill and get caught.  I get that, and it's done really well in TGWTDT.  The men in the book are sensitive and good looking (or monsters, nothing in between).  The women are fierce and brilliant and attractive.  I'm ok with that too.  And Mr. Larsson's book is thrillingly twistingly paced, the characters multiplicitous yet distinctly drawn, and the settings painstakingly described.  I couldn't stop reading, and when I was done, I was both satisfied and wanting more.  A literary job well done.<br /><br />However, because of my own personal slant, I'm not going to pick up the second two books.  I don't like to dwell on violence in art form (there's more than enough of it in the real world for my tastes), and especially violence towards women.  But TGWTDT is a great read, and I'm sorry for Mr. Larsson's far too early demise.
B001HN694K|4.0|After the missed opportunity of Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature (not to mention Paramount's 1933 live-action curio), director Tim Burton takes Lewis Carroll on a cinematic roller-coaster ride. The 2010 \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" has an enchanting spark that somehow eluded Disney nearly 60 years earlier. Mia Wasikowska's inspired performance as a refreshingly mature Alice is well-matched by Helena Bonham Carter's wicked Red Queen and Johnny Depp's twisted Mad Hatter. A tad slow at times, but endlessly imaginative in the Burton tradition. In fact, the new version would make a terrific double-bill with \\"Beetlejuice.\\"
B002JCSWV6|4.0|If don't know rugby, a touchdown is called a try. This movie about the great World Cup rugby game at the beginning of Mandela's Presidency definitely scores. It takes place when South Africa's shaky new multiracial democracy was still finding its feet after years of white rule. Mandela needed to make peace and heal the land. He saw an opportunity to create rapprochement and a national bonding experience by embracing the game beloved by his former enemy and despised by his supporters.     However, there are also some fumbles - the other meaning if you will - of \\"try\\".    Without doubt, Morgan Freeman gives an Oscar-worthy reincarnation of Mandela - thus putting himself firmly in the King-Poitier-Ali-Crosby-Oprah-Obama pantheon of black-people who radically changed white perceptions. Matt Damon too, gives a great aw-shucks performance as an innocent racist who understands how much he has to change. You'll barely recognize this bulked up version of Damon and his South African accent is flawless. But, for the most part they are stock characters - you don't really know what makes Mandela tick and you can't fully grasp the transformation of Pienaar (Damon), the rugby captain, because you just don't know that much about him.    While the movie works well at the storytelling level, it also rings somewhat hollow. You see this momentous change in a terrible political situation through old newscasts but not through the cast. The black presidential security detail has to make peace with white special service cops who may once have jailed them. The white cops are now reporting to people who may once have tried to blow them up. But you see none of this in personal backstories. The pacing is slow but it is steady and it builds. The end may be predictable but the audience still applauded. If you have no idea what rugby is you will leave the theater unenlightened and those of us who know about rugby can see the ball was somehow dropped.     Therein lies the problem: this is a movieabout symbols, the kind that can bring everyone together, make peace and bind a nation. If you can't really explain the true nature of rugby, you can't really explain its significance in this story. As for the title: what is a nice Latin word like Invictus doing in an African movie? Shouldn't Mandela - just one generation away from living in a hut with a polygamous family - be reaching back to an African poem for inspiration? Wouldn't you expect something more African than classical?    In a way, it echoes the story of the kouros statue the Getty Museum once acquired. Scientists analyzed the stone and lawyers certified the paper trail. But when Thomas Hoving of the Met took one look at it, he knew it was fake because it looked \\"fresh\\" - something you don't expect in a 3,000 year old statue. In fact, it was a modern reproduction made from authentic stone from that period.    That is not to say this movie is a fake but it is obviously made - well made, mind you - by people of a different age, place and time who have fused the authentic with something that isn't quite right. The author is a British journalist who covered South Africa, the screenwriter is a non-rugby loving ex-patriate South African living in Morro Bay, California. The supporting actors and Damon's voice coach are all authentic South Africans but the director and the two lead actors are American. As good a job as they did technically, something got lost in the mix. Instead of being too lively, this movie is, if anything, muted - even somber. You'd have to wonder what it would look like if a South African director had made it. What if, say, Gavin Wood (Tsotsi) or an up-and-coming African director had done it, how different would it would be?    First, you would get a visceral sense of the times. People were very scared, very divided but also hopeful. The townships were bursting with exuberance. The whites experienced fear, loathing but also optimism. You see it in Invictus but you really don't feel it. The celebration of the blacks matched the viciousness of the old white regime while the crime spree justified their old fears. Houses once designed to be open - even admired - became surrounded with walls, then barbed wire, power gates and finally, electrified fences. Yet the whites felt somehow liberated too and to understand that you'd have to see how war and rebellion-weary they had become. You never quite feel the two different cultures - an African world drenched in music, dance and excitement versus a stiff, though cordial white world where the music is at best, restrained.     Most of all though, you would understand why rugby really matters. It is not just that the white Afrikaners were the country's exclusive payers of rugby, it is that it's a territorial game. Rugby is played around the scrum, that beehive formation of men from each team pushing against each other in contention for a ball thrust in its midst at the beginning of each play. Whichever team plucks it out - usually by foot - gets to run with the ball. The traditional advantage of the South African team is that they are one of the heaviest in the game. That is why Damon filled up on pap `n wors for the role.  The heavier the scrum the better the chance they have of pushing the other team out of the way and grabbing the ball.    The point about rugby in South Africa is not just that it is the game of the oppressors but a kind of reenactment of the way they pushed the indigenous people off the land to get at its resources. That explains why the formerly great Bokke had lost their mojo. Thanks to majority rule, they were being pushed off their land and they just couldn't pull off their old act on the rugby field any more. At least, not until they had gotten permission, marching orders and reassurance from the new black president.    The poem, Invictus, is never fully fleshed out and in truth it was an obscure 19th century poem written by a 12 year old who'd lost his leg to TB. While understandably awkward as a poem it ends with these two resounding lines:     \\"I am the master of my fate:  I am the captain of my soul.\\"     In fact, Mandela never sent that poem to Pienaar. He had been inspired by it in jail but he actually sent the rugby captain a version of Roosevelt's \\"Man in the Arena\\" speech to inspire him.    Regardless of the actual poem, what matters is that Mandela reached out to a third place - a non-African heritage - to bring these former warring Africans of different races together. How do you explain that to Americans? They see these great aerial shots of Cape Town, the sophisticated cities contrasted with the black shantytowns (although you never go into any of these \\"informal\\" houses) and they must wonder: What Africa is this?     That is not say this isn't a very good movie. It is not \\"Biko\\", \\"Gandhi\\" or even \\"Chariots of Fire\\" though it is at least at the very front of the second tier. There is an academy award nomination or two in this and Clint deserves kudos for taking on something so far afield from his usual fare: Dirty Harry reincarnated as a couple of near-saints. As a feel-good movie it does indeed score: almost everyone wins - the whites, the blacks (he did forget the Jewish guy, Joel Stransky, a kind of South African Sandy Koufax who actually won the game with the drop kick.) The New Zealanders - ironically called the \\"All Blacks\\" on account of their uniforms - get to be the losers here even though they were a much more racially integrated team.     Not only that, but the All Blacks began each game with a fearsome Maori wardance called a Hakka which seemed to be lead by the blondest player. All the Bokke could do was glare back. But any South African knows they have their own ceremonial weapon, which is just as formidable: the Zulu War Dance. Yet no one mentions it - perhaps because Afrikaner rugby players don't dance like that - ever - and Mandela was Xhosa as were most of the ruling ANC party and they were feuding with the Zulus. TheNew Zealanders even had rugby's first true superstar, Jonah Loma, a terrifying figure who could simply plough through the opposing team with legs as thick and as unstoppable as tree trunks rolling down a cliff.     Nevertheless, Mandela's support, Afrikaner determination and a little Hebrew footwork won the day and put the country on the track toward unity. In the end, this movie wins the cup but you get the idea there is more to be drunk from it along with a few more visits to the well.    © Alan Brody    [...]
055380684X|4.0|Author Daniel Coyle develops an interesting thesis with \\"The Talent Code\\" which seeks to abate time-honored adages such as \\"natural born talent.\\"  Coyle argues that talent must be cultivated and grown.  He argues that there are two fundamental components of talent. The first being myelin, the biological insulator which allows humans to achieve broadband-speed neural circuitry. The second component is psychological, defined in three distinct layers: motivation, practice and master coaching.<br /><br />Through a series of stories and anecdotes, Coyle uncovers the roots of talent (what he calls talent hotbeds.)  We learn about all-star athletes, musicians, students and celebrities.  Most importantly, we learn not to accept the rhetoric of \\"overnight sensation\\" and \\"natural born star.\\"  The truth is that every one of us has innate and exceptional talent--but only a few the opportunity to discover what we are truly passionate about, and then even fewer, the stamina to pursue our passions with rigor. As we read, in numerous success stories, the children who develop into world-class virtuoso's start like any other student: average (or less than) ability with numerous mistakes.  However, those who persist and develop their passion with disciplined practice see the fruits of their labor after a mere 10,000 hours (this number has been studied extensively, in fact.)<br /><br />Readers may find this book confronts similar themes as Malcom Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers]](also an excellent book.) However, there is more scientific evidence presented to readers here in Coyle's analysis of talent. I would suggest this book for both young adults and certainly future parents.  It sheds a unique and interesting light on the subject of human talent and learning in a very accessible and entertaining way.  \\"A+\\"
B001HN6940|5.0|We looked forward to seeing Alice in 3-D in the theater and we were not disappointed.  The 3-D was seamlessly integrated into the film; better than Avatar.  It was colorful, whimsical and at the same time dark.  I would not recommend it for small children as it would be scary for them, but older children will appreciate the simpler aspects of the movie.  For teenagers and adults the story will be interesting although at times it's slow.  There's a big battle scene that goes on too long, but over all the pacing is decent and story multilevel.  My favorite character in the movie is the Red Queen; over the top and so fun to watch and listen to.  Alice was a little weak, and Depp's Mad Hatter was sympathetic and damaged, but pulls through in the end.  Don't get it expecting Disney, as many have said.  I enjoyed the theatrical version enough to plan to buy the disc so I can watch it again and catch the small things I missed.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Here, again, is another Denzel Washington movie that will have you thinking about it long after the viewing is done.  Denzel puts in a strong performance as the movie's lead, a character that echoes back to the \\"man with no name\\" type of hero made famous by Clint Eastwood.  Here in a post-apocalyptic world where the death of a feral cat mirrors the manner in which the survivors of nuclear devastation treat each other, the audience is immersed in a cold, stark world that is both repulsive and fascinating.  I couldn't stop watching the screen.  The bleached colors of the film serve to enhance the bleak nature of this new environment and the fantastic, often haunting, musical score truly adds to the eerie atmosphere.    Gary Oldman, Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Mila Kunis are well cast and demand your attention in their roles.  We also get some exciting action sequences, particularly the showdown that takes place at the home of a very eccentric couple (also well-played).  Thought-provoking, spiritual, frightening, and reflective, THE BOOK OF ELI is all these things and the movie is well worth the price of admission.      This single-disc DVD comes with a couple of special features: deleted/additional scenes and an animated short called \\"A Lost Tale: Billy\\" which explores the background of Gary Oldman's character.  Denzel Washington fans certainly won't be disappointed.
0439023491|4.0|sometimes sequels are letdowns and i think catching fire fails to match the power of the first book only because the hunger games was so great. suzanne collins set her own bar too high! this book continues this excellent future history, but the narrative doesn't quite pack the same punch. too much of it seems to be recapping instead of fresh action, but i still want to give it four and a half stars. this is a great PA series.
B002ZG9788|5.0|This was an action movie... A FANTASTIC action movie! I went to the cinemas and paid to see this movie several times because it brought Greek mythology to life on the big screen in a way that has NEVER been done before. No, the acting was not Oscar-worthy. I'm sorry folks, but get over it. Not every movie must be an indie masterpiece with riveting acting from unknown foreigners. That's what film festivals are for. Some films are made for the acting, some for the artistic eye, some for the point of jerking tears from sobbing eyes, but some are for pure entertainment.     Luckily, this movie has a good taste of some of those other attributes as well, but with a gnashing, string-heavy, and edgily-strung score by Ramin Djawadi (whose previous works include Iron Man, Prison Break, and others), beautiful filming locations in Scandinavia and the Canary Islands, as well as gritty, epic, action scenes, this movie is a sheer delight as far as action blockbusters go.     There is a reason it made nearly half a billion dollars worldwide. Go see it for yourself. True, not everybody liked what they saw, but if the dislikes outweighed the likes as far as movie viewers go, you would see more of a Ghost Rider dud effect (which garnered just over 200 million worldwide) on the box office numbers, which is clearly not present in this awesome sword and sandals romp.     No, it is not an intelligent Bourne-type thriller, nor is it an Avatar-grade special effects bonanza, but it is convincing and EXTREMELY enjoyable for what it is... a mythological action quest of epic proportions, and a fair and non-condescending re-imagining of the 80's original. I could not ask for anything more from the best mythological epic made in a very long time!
B003RMUWEW|5.0|Another GREAT installment in the Doctor Who series (season 5 episode 8) can't wait til the next 3 get here!
0385504225|5.0|Ok, I've read many of the one star reviews to see if I was missing something, but I have to stick with my feelings and give Dan another five stars.  Sure this book could have been edited down to about 350 pages and gotten the same point across, but I didn't mind the detail and repetition that he kept in the story.<br /><br />This look into the architecture and layout of the Nation's Capitol was interesting and gave the reader some interesting trivia during the story.<br /><br />The number 33 will stick with me and I'll be looking for a few key things the next time I'm in DC.<br /><br />I loved the end of the story and how Mal'akh was to receive his wisdom.  The end of the story kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />It seems like this story will make a great movie, and may have even been written to insure that reality.  The characters were developed with great detail and the images were easy to follow, as was the story.<br /><br />All in all I have to give it to Dan for his research and ability to weave his stories together.  There is a reason he is one of the top authors in American today.<br /><br />Some things you will enjoy learning about:  Magic squares, significant of the number 33 and how it shows up all over DC, true meaning of the word apocalypse, the \\"Lost Word\\", tip of the Washington Monument, Laus  Deo and much more.  All these come together in a way that will give you pause when you think of religion and the true God, or if the only God there is reside within.<br /><br />Finally, as human understanding races forward it brings to mind Kurzweil's view of the singularity.  I feel like we will destroy ourselves before realizing the singularity, or apocalypse as stated in this book, but if we do reach it before killing ourselves over competing resources then we just may find the peace that is alluded to by Dan.

0451216725|3.0|I don't agree with some of the negative reviews.  I thought that this was a pretty good book. The suspense kept my interest. I enjoyed the story from the point of view of Lucas, the main character. I liked how the mystery was being unraveled as Lucas, who lost his memory, was discovering pieces of his identity. The plot had some fun twists and turns. The transitions between the past and present were smooth. Some of the characters could have been developed further. I had the feeling that the book may have been written in a hurry. And I was a little disappointed in the ending.
