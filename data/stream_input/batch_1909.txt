1401235166|4.0|This is the 17th book in the Fables series and picks up after the battle with Mister Dark.  It was a decent installment in the series and I enjoyed it.  We see a lot of little snippets of different stories here, so it is a bit of a transition book.<br /><br />In this book we start to see a number of new storylines starting up.  The Fables are trying to rebuild their lives.  Buffkin is trying to start a rebellion in Oz.  A new North Wind must be chosen, and the ex-nurse Spratt is honing her fighting skills to revenge Mister Dark.<br /><br />A lot is going on in this book, it was an enjoyable read but a bit piecemeal.  You get quick snippets from all the different stories.  The storyline that gets the most attention is the choosing of the new North Wind.  We get to meet the other winds and watch as Snow and Bigby's children compete to be the North Wind.<br /><br />Amidst that North Wind storyline we see the Fables rebuilding and Buffkin started a rebellion in Oz.  A lot of time is also devoted to Nurse Spratt as she trains to take on a new identity and revenge Mister Dark.  It seems like she will be playing a large role in future installments.<br /><br />There is also Christmas special in which Rose tries to decide what type of Lady of Hope she will become.<br /><br />As with previous books the illustration was wonderful and in keeping with the story.<br /><br />Overall a solid addition to this series.  I enjoyed the North Wind storyline and am curious where the storylines featuring Buffkin and Nurse Spratt are going.  Recommended to fans of urban fantasy graphic novels.
B00464F19Q|4.0|Great Classic Movie.  Great Actors.  Playback was flawless, no issues.  I have the movie in my library for playback.  Only wish there was a way to watch it on my andriod tablet, too!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I love the updates of how much your battery is charged or losing charge. its also great how it tells how much time u have left to use different things until it dies.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|The author's combination of horrid personal experience and &#34;forced&#34; inhumane behavior forma a valid hearing for his practice of helping others see themselves and all of life in a new way.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Trapped me from the first two chapters. Had never come across such a writing concept before.<br />The story set-up and the writing style make this intriguing book hard to put down!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The movie was funny but from all the reviews I expected to see a much funnier movie.  I'm glad I did not go out and buy this one, not worth the cost.
014017821X|4.0|This book was recommended to me as an excellent set of adult short story fairy tale retellings (which I am a fan of).  This book contains a number of fairy tale retellings told in a beautifully descriptive and somewhat disturbing story style.  I enjoyed it, but it was a slow read for me.  Something to be savored and not rushed.<br /><br />This book contains a number of fairy retellings including (but not limited to) the following retellings: Bluebeard, Puss in Boots, Beauty and the Beast, and Red Riding Hood.  It also includes a couple short stories about vampires and werewolves.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this, although it is a slow read because it is written in a flowery style with older style language.  This makes the story beautifully descriptive, but you really have to read carefully.<br /><br />Although they are beautifully written these aren't a set of tales for children.  On the back it describes them as \\"vulgar\\" at times and that is pretty much right on the mark.  At times the language and disturbing scenes of violence and/or sex are almost jarring embedded in this beautiful flowing language.  It makes for a fascinating contrast, but is definitely adults only suitable.<br /><br />A number of tales feature young woman who place themselves in a risky situation to gain wealth and power.  As you might expect they are forced to pay the price by sleeping with older disturbing men or a beastly animal-like man...etc.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book and found it a interesting read.  The language is beautiful, the stories are crafted in an old-fashioned way with flowery language, the vulgar scenes provide an interesting and disturbing contrast to the rest of the stories.  These are not happy faerie tales but more disturbing cautionary tales.  Recommended to adults who enjoy fairy tale retellings and are up for something a bit different than your standard retelling.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is awesome. I can't put it down. I just wish I had more friends and more energy to build up.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|just love this stuff.mostly when waiting in the drive thrum at kfc.....even my kid enjoy cant wait for the next game.give me more......I will wait for the best any day....
B008JGSM6G|4.0|the app is good, the game super addicting, but then every few turns, the game suddenly pauses, and you think it froze,  but then an ad pops up and you have to click the x and then the game freezes for a second and you can get back. Try flow bridges if you want to try something new or love flow.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|lots of fun! love getting a bonus adventure and enjoy the hidden object scenes and puzzles.  the guide was helpful.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is a very, not to serious, movie by old action junkies that is just fun to watch.  All of the bit players are great and just makes you hope they do an Expendables 3
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Good read... love all the different characters and how they all interact with each other... a must read for anyone...
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This game is so much fun. I dont usually go for these kinds of games. Im more of a Hidden Object Adventure type of gal. But boy did I have fun with this one. The controls work well & the difficulty starts out easy so u can get used to it then gets harder at a good pace. I got pretty far through the levels but now Im stuck. I either need more practice or my phone isn't able to react as fast as this game requires it to in order to beat this level. Its the one where u have to keep up with the black cube or fall to your death. Racing that black cube seems impossible! How does he change direction so fast!? I get so frustrated that I cant play the harder levels anywhere near bedtime or I end up wide awake & pissed. lol  But thats a sign of a great game. I highly recommend it.
159420411X|4.0|I have followed Nate Silver since he was writing for Baseball Prospectus--before his interest in politics, before the 538 blog--and I like his writing. He shifts the focus in many debates from theories and posturing to data--what really happens in the world around us. He takes a broad approach, applying basic concepts about predictive models to baseball, weather forecasting, political science, poker, and more. He is always even-handed in his approach, pointing out what can and can't be gained from statistics. But ultimately I didn't feel like he was making a deeper contribution to the way we understand the world. As an educated lay person who likes to read science books, there is little that I walked away saying \\"this is a new, important thing that changed the way I looked at the world.\\" It was diverting, but it wasn't revolutionary. I guess if that's the worst you can say about a book, it's a pretty good book.
B005LAII1C|5.0|for years i thought Airplane was the funniest movie i ever seen. young frankenstein, blazing saddles and the roast of william shatner, a must see roast. but Ted is just hysterical. the extras are great.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|The plot is basically as follows - this nasty entity named Parallax (sounds like a drug for arthritis or erectile disfunction) is floating around the universe destroying worlds, eating souls, etc.  You know, the usual evil space entity kind of stuff.  Kind of reminds me of a floating skull Galactus or something.  The Green Lanterns, as protectors of the universe and what have you, must stop the evil Parallax.  Got that?  Ok.<br /><br />The caveat to all this is that Parallax was previously defeated and imprisoned by a Green Lantern named Abin Sur.  Parallax was apparently the greatest enemy that the Lanterns had faced.  It was quite an accomplishment by Abin Sur to defeat him.  The problems start when Parallax escapes.<br /><br />Are you ready to have your world shattered by a revelation of why this film is so stupid?  Ok... her it goes.<br /><br />If a Green Lantern named Abin Sur defeated Parallax and saved the universe, why is it that apparently the Green Lanterns know absolutely nothing about it?  Huh?  Sinestro, the leader of the Lanterns HAS NO IDEA what or who Parallax is.  None of the Lanterns have any idea at all.  Huh?  Parallax was the greatest threat they faced... Parallax had been defeated by Abin sur (who is still around btw).  So why the heck doesn't anyone know anything about Parallax?  Does this make any sense at all?  Any?  Of course not... it is completely and utterly stupid.<br /><br />Having said that, allow me dear friends to ask a simple question - why did the writers choose to have the Lanterns not know about Parallax?  Why?  Or put it this way... wouldn't it been better if they had known about Parallax from the beginning?  If that was the case, the plot would have gone something like - *Oh no!  It is Parallax!  He has escaped!  Green Lantern's to battle!  We must defeat him once again!*  You know, something along those lines.<br /><br />But no.  Since the Lanterns inexplicably know nothing about him, the plot goes something like *Parallax who?  Parallax what?  Gee... I guess we should send out some Lanterns to take care of this thing... and then get our butts kicked by it... and then find out after the fact that the Council knew about it and let us go anyway... etc...etc.*<br /><br />Get my point?  Not only is the plot stupid because it makes no sense.  It is stupid because the plot would have been better if the Lanterns had known in the first place.<br /><br />Having said that, the film then doubles down on the stupidity.<br /><br />Parallax is running around making a mess of things, so Sinestro approaches the Green Lantern Council (a group of little blue people called Guardians or something) about what to do.  Sinestro mentions that Abin Sur referred to the threat as \\"Parallax\\" before he was lost.  Then Sinestro begs the council to allow him to lead a team of his best Lanterns against the threat.  The council agrees - after which the group of Lanterns get their butts kicked.<br /><br />Here is the problem - we later find out that even though the Lanterns didn't know about Parallax, the Council knew who Parallax was - Parallax used to be one of them.  He was seduced by the yellow power of fear and became Parallax (sort of like Darth Vader was seduced I guess).  Even though the Lanterns have never heard of Parallax, the Council is well aware of him.  Ok ... but then why doesn't the council mention any of this to Sinestro?  Huh?  They allow Sinestro to lead a team of Lanterns to their doom knowing full well that Parallax is too powerful.  What?  Cat got their tongue or something?  If I was Sinestro, I'd be mighty upset when I got back.  \\"What - didn't anyone think that this information was important to tell me before sending us out to get slaughtered?\\"<br /><br />On another subject - I thought that the explanation of green power (will) and yellow power (fear) was stupid.  Hal Jordan, the \\"new\\" green lantern is told that the Lanterns harness the green power of will because it is the most powerful force in the universe.  Uhhh... ok.  Then how do you explain Parallax?  This is one guy who tampered with the yellow power and became a universal menace.  One guy.  One guy exposed to yellow that is apparently more powerful than all the green ones put together.  And green is more powerful how?<br /><br />Also, when the Lanterns have to come up with a plan to defeat Parallax, what do they do?  They forge a yellow ring.  I suppose they must figure that all the green ones aren't good enough.  So I repeat - the green power is more \\"powerful\\" how?<br /><br />Speaking of the green power and of rings, does it make any sense that Sinestro questions Hal Jordan's selection as a Lantern?  Why wouldn't Sinestro give him the benefit of the doubt?  After all, we are told that the green power is the most powerful power in the universe.  We are also told that the rings seek out those who are deserving of the power.  Well, Abin Sur's ring found Abin Sur at one point, and Abin Sur was great, so why wouldn't the ring do the same thing again?  Did Sinestro think the ring went haywire or something?  Did he think the ring was broken?  Why the heck did he think the ring selected Hal Jordan?  Huh?  Did Sinestro think he was smarter than the ring?<br /><br />Again, this makes no sense at all.  The correct reaction would have been for Sinestro to recognize that Hal Jordan must have the potential because the ring selected him.  Look... either you have faith in the green power or you don't.  If you do, you trust the ring.  If you don't, then what the heck are you doing leading the Lanterns?  So what does Sinestro do?  He mocks Hal Jordan, tells him he is worthless, and that the ring made a mistake.  It makes no sense.<br /><br />Well - all is good in the end.  Lucky for Hal Jordan and the rest of the Lanterns that Parallax, though very powerful, is apparently the dumbest skull shaped space cloud in the universe.  How dumb is he you ask?  Parallax is so dumb that he ends up killing himself by flying into the sun.  Sure, he is chasing Jordan toward the sun.... but what?  Didn't he see the sun or something?  Didn't the cloud think to himself... \\"Hmmmm... I'm getting kind of close to the sun... maybe this isn't a good idea...\\"  Parallax is a giant space cloud, so I figure the guy must have some experience flying around planets and suns and such.  Therefore, I find it a bit odd that Parallax thought this would be a good day to chase a Lantern so close to the sun that he couldn't escape.<br /><br />Look - I don't have high standards for these films, but I can't fathom how this stuff gets past the directors, producers, writers, editors, etc.  Wasn't there a single person on the set asking himself or herself why none of the Green Lanterns had ever heard of Parallax?  Wasn't there a single voice in the crowd that said it didn't make sense?
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|To think that this sort of stuff is going on all the time and we never hear abou tit.  I have the utmost respect and gratitude for the work our folks in the armed services do.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|I used to have this on DVD, and lost it in various moves!  The only Tom Cruise movie (other than the Outsiders) I really love!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK, its great for teenagers! I loved everything about the book! I can't wait to see the movie
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|Product arrived a week before estimate and the games all come on 1 disc! This was an amazing find and I recommend anyone who is checking this out to click they 'buy' button NOW! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!<br />The only thing I will say in the negative is that if you are expecting to play online or on network, it would seem that 3DO has stopped that service for these games (which makes sense considering their age).<br />If you find different let me know and I will update this review.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app! I dont why people are saying it kills your battery, it doesn't. I love how it tells me my battery level, how  it tells you your available hours, and how its right there in your pulldown. Best of all, its free.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Easy, relaxing game play. Just what I'm looking for. Yes, you'll have to pay for &quot;diamonds&quot;  but you can choose not to purchase anything and still play. Just takes a little longer.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|Good action flick.  Danzel is great.  Nice plot line and twists in this movie.  Keeps you guessing.  Ending is a little weak
B000R8YC1I|5.0|I got this for my sister for Christmas because we used to watch it all the time when we were younger. She was so happy because she has been looking for it in stores for years
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a understandable dictionary, I learned new words. It's very fun plus I didn't have anything else to do on here!!! My<br />Wi-Fi isn't working yet!!! BUT I LIKE IT!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The best zombie apocalypse film series by far!  Lots of drama and stars are not spared tragedy from death or harm.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book, couldn't put it down.  The characters are well drawn, the story is absorbing.  Although it moves back and forth through several time periods, it is easy to follow.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good tale.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|There were lots of changes in season 5, but not as many as there were for season 3. Very good entertainment. I wish BBC would show more of this type of series on American television. I'm glad, however, that Amazon does.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|From the onset of this program it has been a hit though there are people out there that have watched it and have blogged negative stuff but forgot to take into account that it is just a show
030746363X|5.0|Great book for anyone who is looking to change their body.  This isn't a New Year's resolution book, it's a New Life resolution.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a good game.. it's a cool version of Mario... it's fun... I give it 5 stars<br />This game is worth the play... even though it's free it's a great game for dsi&acute;s and all that... totally download and play this game
B003VANOFY|5.0|These are the best headphones I have ever purchased. You can poop while listening to your friends play video games and use the macro buttons to queue your microphone while you're letting out an amazing chorus of fart noises.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great book. One of the best books I've ever read in my life. Couldn't put it down. I loved the feelings.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great movie, with great cast.  Especially if you love baseball or any kind of sport with a following, you'll like this movie.
B001AP11L6|4.0|This is an exceptional CD all song's worth listening to some a little different but still worth it and I recommend this to anyone that listen's to this type of music
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|this game eats up your membery don't ever get this game it eats up your space.its crap and atroshis I hate it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I enjoyed season 1 and 2, but somebody hit the GO button this season. Right from the start you can tell things have changed, and it's a roller coaster ride. We love to see each episode and we hate to see each episode. The love is because the drama surrounding the environment rocks. The hate is because the emotions sometimes border on hopelessness.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is, cool, fun, and absaloutely addictive. But, it frequently crashes! It is annoying when I am in the middle of the game and it crashes. Fix, and its 5 stars.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Yet another engaging story. Looking forward to the next book in<br />This trilogy. It will be interesting to see how these families will evolve in the next book.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Cool App....missing one thing...a blending tool!! Other apps call it a smudger..be nice if you could pick the width of your choice of art tool
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|but I fell asleep in the middle of it. Is this a reflection of the movie's quality, or was I just exceptionally tired? You decide.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is exactly what I wanted.  I had the Cannon bag that came with my camera but it was too big and bulky.  I monogrammed this basic bag and added some bling and gotten nothing but complements on it.  Love it!  There are removable &#34;walls&#34; and I simply placed them over my longer lens to keep them secure.  The camera compartment is a little big when I have my 50mm on it, but the camera seems to stay in place.  I feel that it's all protected very well and there are a lot of compartments and pockets.  I liked the basic black over the more expensive and almost identical Cannon backpack.  The Cannon was a funky green color.  Over all very satisfied for the price.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great object find game with story line.  Very excited I can play on my Kindle Fire, only drawback is graphics are smaller than on PC.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is the best Snow White tale out this year.  Forget seeing the others. I begrudgingly even liked Kristen Stewart.  Charlize Theron was awesome as the stepmother Queen.  Don't miss this one.  Probably too intense for grade schoolers.
1401310400|2.0|The book only comes in small print and I had trouble reading it.  I was disappointed because it didn't seem to be like the tv show, which I like a lot!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i have not come across a more addictive game in a long time.  My 11 year old granddaughter showed me this game.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grandsons downloaded this game and have played it non stop.  My daughter got a Kindle Fire HD and liked this gamer so much she downloaded it also onto her new Kindle.  So see the little ones can sure show the older ones that age has no place in fun games.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like Evernote and use it daily on my laptop. I'm glad to have the app on my Kindle too.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|I ordered this as a Kindle Deal of the Day, and it is the first William Boyd novel I've ever read. I really enjoyed the book - the writing, the plot flow and the ending. The author transitions back and forth between past and present seamlessly, and creates an absorbing story that doesn't completely play out until the very end. The story of Eve Delectorskaya is interesting on its own, but its weaving with her current story and her daughter Ruth's life creates an interesting and absorbing tale. I especially liked the ending. So many novels fall apart at the end or don't necessarily tie all the loose ends together. I thought this might have the same kind of ending, since there were some things in Eve's story that didn't entirely make sense. But everything falls together at the end, both the confrontation with Romer and its aftermath, and the scholarly explanation (given by Ruth's potential love interest, a professor with an expertise in WW II espionage) of the confusing events that took place in New Mexico.<br /><br />In all, it was a very satisfying book to read.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|A wonderful app. Lots of immediate action without a tedious amount of mechanics to learn. Graphics are clean and the action is smooth. And it's FUN!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This movie was great! If you like to hear a girl group kick some boys butts in singing. This movie will have you on your feet wanting to see more rebellion from the girls and seeing them grow as a group.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|a bit too raunchy at times,  but fun one time watch. Would recommend kids to not be in audible range also
0756655307|5.0|I really would love it if you guys put if they are heroes or villains, but most of all I love it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. it is so fun and addictive.I just downloaded it this morning and Im all ready on level 20
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|My wife wanted this CD so I ordered it and received as promised. She plays it often during the day.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is  a great  free app.  The only drawback is the advertisement between every game.  You can quickly click out of the advertisement so it's not that much of an issue.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The betrayal, the subplot in subterfuge, the political tension. Plots in this book propel an action novel into a different realm. Looking forward to reading mockingjay
B00APUQT7I|5.0|kids had seen it with a group of friends in theater, but were eager to watch it again. Wife & I loved it too.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The movies are in good shape and the high def transfers are in good shape.<br /><br />All of the hate and grief on Lucas needs to stop, he created this and can do what ever he wants to it.<br /><br />Now that Disney owns the franchise they might release the originals and make everyone happy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It keeps me busy when I have nothing else to do and you get to play alone
B00AE2J93I|3.0|We had a mix of kids and adults watch. Some of us really liked it, but some did mot at all. It is a mix of horror movie and humor that will not resonate with everyone.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Lots of stoner humor, but quite funny outside of that subculture. Lots of out-of-context humor as well as, likely, the most hilarious case of mistaken identity.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|The best part of the book is at the end when the author actually says something along the lines of...you may think reading this book was a waste of time because it is filled withbasic or obvious information, but this information took me 20 yrs to compile...(so there must be something wrong with your judgmental dismissal of my fascinating in-depth writing), so now go back and read it again.  LOL! Good very basic info. C-<br /><br /> youlook
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This is what the first and second movie should  have been  like. If you are  a transformer fan  from the  1980's this movie is  for  you. ( Oh, I am telling my age)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I zoomed through all the episodes of Seasons I and II of Downton Abbey and currently am in withdrawal, hoping Season III will be out soon.<br /><br />This series is SO well done, the characteries so dimensional and all the interweaving multiple story lines fascinating. This is not at all like former &#34;yaaaawn&#34; series that were slow moving and seemed to just continually underscore the class difference between the staff of a huge house and the privileged people who lived there.<br /><br />PLEASE....I so hope for more Downton Abbey soon!!! Oh.....I watched all episodes on my Kindle Fire and it was spectacular.
B006CHML4I|4.0|My wife bought this for our teenage son after he claimed mine; we both like it, but for its quirky wind-up: Since it winds up by being shaken (presumably from your arm-swing while walking), we noticed that it tends to run fast if one has a more active lifestyle and slower if one is the opposite (and once it stopped altogether when I was bedridden for two days). We're still trying to find a balance between under- and over-winding. Still, it's a nice-looking watch at the price.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|I'm not a big SBC fan, but he has done some funny stuff.  Maybe I should have watched the unrated version because this one was very slow and thin on laughs.  By the way, Sacha, it's always good to take a cute woman like Anna Faris and make her look androginous, that always sells movies...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Kept my interest all through the story. It was kind of erotic in some parts of the story. Pretty well written
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love that there are free puzzles to choose from. It seems like a good game for many ages. It's great that they have different levels to choose from.I would give it 5 stars if it didn't freeze when loading on my kindle fire sometimes.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|All smaller novelettes, put into 1 large story. Very well written.  I highly recommend this Omnibus Edition for any reader.
1594487154|5.0|Let's face it. When you hear someone say, \\"I'm in sales\\", the image that comes to mind is less than exemplary. Deep inside, I cringe, taking an imaginary two steps away from the person.<br /><br />As a small biz owner, intellectually, I know that sales is important. Yet it feels hard--and manipulative. Several years ago, on the advice of a friend who is a \\"natural\\" sales person, I ordered a book on selling. When it arrived in the mail, the bright red cover was punctuated with the words, \\"Based on the world famous SPIN selling strategy...\\" I never cracked it open.<br /><br />When I heard that Dan Pink was coming out with a new book, To Sell Is Human, my interest was more than piqued. I was relieved. I've been a fan of Dan Pink since he wrote A Whole New Mind in 2005.  No matter the topic, Pink's writing is always cogent, well-researched, and honest--with stories and a framework that make his points memorable. To apply these gifts to a topic that chronically confounds and solves a relevant problem for so many is a huge service.<br /><br />(BTW--this book is not just for those who are allergic to traditional sales. The concepts apply to anyone with a need to influence others, to move them in some way--whether it's your high school senior who still hasn't finished his college applications a day before the deadline or the frugal program manager who holds the purse strings for your next project.)<br /><br />[Full disclosure:  I received an advance complimentary copy of the book, as part of being a member of an unpaid launch team.  My review below is based solely on the merits of the book. In other words, I would have written the same review, independent of being on the launch team.]<br /><br />This book excels in three areas:<br /><br />* Bust myths. Pink handily shows why the old schmoozy way of selling (\\"buyer beware\\") is no longer effective in an age when information is plentiful and feedback loops are immediate (\\"seller beware\\").<br /><br />* Explain the science behind what matters. The author draws from social psychology research to help the reader understand simple behaviors and attitudes that make a huge difference, not to \\"hoodwink\\" an unsuspecting poor soul, but to increase the chances of creating a true connection, and ultimately, to be of service.<br /><br />* Put a human face to the science, by being a part of the experiment. One example: Pink melds the academic research with a wonderful story of persisting in the face of what all of us fear but know as part of the territory--rejection. He recounts literally following in the footsteps of the *last* Fuller Brush man as he walks the streets of San Francisco.  It's fascinating. There are other examples of Pink testing the research and in the process, giving the reader wry commentary. At a class on improvisation (one of the keys to selling) in business, he's asked by a fellow participant where he works: \\"\\"I'm a writer,\\" I say, inviting conversation with false cheer.  \\"I work for myself.\\"  [The participant] turns away and doesn't talk to me again.  Seems like this guy needs help on listening. (Or perhaps I need to reread the chapter on pitching.)\\"<br /><br />Yes, there's a model (the new ABCs of selling) and instructional labels for what to do (Pitch, Improvise, and Serve). There are simple tools and exercises for the reader to practice applying the concepts. (Look especially at the chapter on Pitch for easy to use templates.) But the genius of this book is that it shows how to be in integrity with what you desire and how to get there.  You don't have to sell out to sell. Someone doesn't have to lose for you to win. Instead of memorizing a script, close your mouth and open your mind.<br /><br />A friend once told me that people don't need so much to be taught as reminded. Dan Pink reminds us to be human, to defy what we've been told is true and turn to what we know is true, deep in our gut. To sell is to be of service and it starts with creating a meaningful connection.  Thisis a book that I will be returning to again and again.is a book that I will be returning to again and again.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Great puzzles challenging but not to the point of frustration. G5e has done it again.  Keep this type of game coming.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Every bit as good as the first time I read it. Ender's Game is perhaps the best sci-fi book I've ever read. It has so much depth, and treats the idea of gifted children with respect and believability.
1419705849|5.0|A quick read for three generations in our family.<br />It is fun to see Greg's problems continue as he grows up.
B000OVLINI|5.0|It took me a little time to get into this book, but once I did, I was hooked. Loved all the unusual characters, and the way the story of the past and the story of the present intertwined. A very suspenseful mystery/love story revolving around an old book.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|Interesting movie. Good story. Well enough acted. Beautiful scenery.<br />Not all movies need to be rapidly action packed, imho. Sometimes a good story is enough, and this one is.<br />Reminded me a little of the old Westerns...<br />It's worth your time, and with Amazon Prime, it's free to stream, so give it a try.
0307943259|5.0|I thought this book was again different than his others.  It took a while to get hooked but half-way through, he had me

B007TXN4TK|4.0|fun fun fun. hope a new version comes out soon. surprised all family members. we have a great team try it
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This was a surprisingly different story then what I thought it would be.  Definitely a page turner with a twist to a typical 'bad relationship' story.  I really enjoyed this authors writing style and look forward to more from her.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love the series -- got all 5 seasons at rock bottom Black Friday price.  Was worth getting on line at 3 am.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Bought this recommended book.  Haven't finished it yet but really do like it.  Lots of information.  Love books about our military since we spent 25 years active duty.  Our service members don't get the respect they desired.  This shows a little of what they do for our country.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book of this trilogy was what I expected.  I am definitely looking forward to Entwined to you, the last book of the trilogy.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Enjoyed the movie, interesting plot, decent action, however, I decided on a 3 instead of a 4, because of the obvious time paradox blunder created by the writers, like an irritating blister.  Of course, that's Hollywood for ya.  For me, this is one of those movies like the Sixth Sense...  Once you've seen the movie, the ending leaves you with knowledge making it hard to watch the movie again.  Who knows, maybe I'll change my tune later, but not anytime soon.  Good flick though, definite need to see at least once.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Good book, much better than the show, enjoy the whole crew, good byplay between the characters. Hope the series continues

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|i have read all the books in the series and this i think would come in as one of the funniest. i finished it n one day and i liked the big roll manny played in tjis book because without him the bookwould not be funny. i hope anybody who reads it enjoys it
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. I thought because it was the third in the franchise the makers would get sloppy. They did not.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|If you love Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights or the The Woman in White this is a must read. A great modern story that pulls from favorite classics and intertwines two very unlikely people in a compelling story that you can't put down until the story has been told.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love the series -- got all 5 seasons at rock bottom Black Friday price.  Was worth getting on line at 3 am.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|These beautiful songs have always been the star of the play and now this beautiful movie.  Anne Hathaway was born to sing &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34;.  Price Amazon offered incredible. Have enjoyed listening to score for years and now feel like they are brand new. PP
B008OM7A6I|5.0|I had a hunch after hearing his music on Bushfire Records that I would like this and I was right. I did try and buy this here in the U.K. but I wanted the snazzy sleeve, so thanks Amazon in the good old U.S of A. Love it, love it, love it. xx

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I like most time travel type movies.  This one starts off great...well explained, easy to follow.  About half way through you need to really pay attention.  I'll probably watch it again to see if I missed something.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The cast and their acting was not up to par. As a fan of the &#34;Alien&#34; movies, was expecting a lot more from Prometheus. As my good friend once said, &#34;the quality of acting was just not there&#34;. I'm a fan of Michael Fassbender but not in this movie.
1594487154|5.0|I received a copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone.<br /><br />In typical Pink style, the analysis is digestible, thought-provoking, and sometimes sad and/or humorous. He writes in a welcoming way, and you feel as though you are in his living room having a conversation with him. I will now look for ways I can better \\"sell\\" my own ideas!
B0048KXRR6|5.0|This is a great family movie! Loved the first one and this one is just as good! Emma Thompson reprises her role and does a great job.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This is a story of solving a puzzle while chasing down some of the most cold-blooded killers on earth.  How the chase goes and the surprise ending will keep you reading through the night.

B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Entertaining to watch. Good not great. I like Shia and the other brothers. I also like moonshine, never had it though. It was good to rent.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I wouldn't say it was a bad film, but it was rather predictable and formulaic and the writing seemed rather contrived.  Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are both great actors, but there is not much substance here.  Just a superficial stab at father-daughter relationships and dealing with aging parents.  Some humorous moments.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a creative game! I love problem solving games and this is a good one! Love the multiple puzzles within one level.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I knew this was going to be a great book, just because I really love Colleen Hoover, but Oh My God...this book was absolutely fantastic! She did it again....this story will grip your heart, then rip it out, then finally piece it back together again. I loved Sky and Holder...such a beautiful love.\\" I live you Sky\\" ...this book was so so great!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Hidden object and puzzles. I Love it!<br /><br />It's highly addicting. Nice art and graphics. Interesting story.<br /><br />It's just as good as their other games.

0800179501|5.0|Tis is an old movie but we love it and actually bought this one for a young boy we know. It has lesson learning in it while being very entertaining as well whether you take up Karate or not.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is such a great show.  It's a laugh out loud series which I recommend for everyone.  I plan on getting the other seasons as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg! This game is awesome. It is very easy to control... you swipe the screen to turn, tilt it to get the coins you can use to buy new characters and items. You also slide down to slide and swipe up to jump. The only negative thing about this app is that it is difficult to play in the car. It has great graphics and is super addicting.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|The look that Tommy Lee Jones has on the cover is pretty much the look he has throughout the whole movie.  While we liked the movie, it certainly glossed over just why is he in such a bad mood all the time?  We also felt that for someone to really be considering that their marriage might be over, Meryl Streep, who was pretty believable, she didn't cry as much as some women might do.  Steve Carrell is great in his role and plays it perfectly.  He should really hook Tommy Lee Jones up with some Anger Management ala Jack Nicholson.
145210655X|5.0|We bought one for oursleves for Fathers Day and one as a gift.  The book is really geared towards adults, rather than kids, with several references to the films.
1878424114|5.0|This book is wonderfully written and filled with wisdom, insight and guidance. I look forward to reading more of Deepak Chopra's books.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|My review sucks, but this movie does not. Buy it, watch it, and watch it again. It's great! It really is.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is great for a free app.  Lots of challenging puzzles...more free options to download and you can pick the number of pieces so kids can even do them.  The picture quality is excellent as well.  I would recommend this app.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Much better than the first... and enough new material to keep it interesting.  Worth watching for sure! I would recommend this to friends and family.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I loved this movie. I will definitely watch this many times. Shia LaBeouf was great in this. He needs to do more movies like this one.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I love all the stars in this movie so I was very disappointed in this movie! BAD!!! Do not rent
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Quite a bit different than the movie. If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy the book. Required word count: achieved.
0394826817|5.0|I chose this gift for my 3 year old niece.  Her mother was so excited.  She thought it it was the perfect gift for her age.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This game is not too hard but also not too easy. It holds your attention but isn't too frustrating. The only frustrating part is the story line. I think it would be better if you were able to find little bits and pieces of her sister's dissapearance with each level you complete. But all in all very good game!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I like a lot of action in movies and this one has it... but I thought the cliche's were overplayed wayyyyy too much and it made it very corny at times.  Just when I was getting into the movie -- lost in the plot -- they'd throw in a &#34;line&#34; the actor is well known for and it would really detract from the flow of the story.  That was pretty lame -- otherwise it was a super movie with some of the greatest actors.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I used to play this game all the time; and was quite good at it; but when I press on the arrows, nothing happens at times; and then it just keeps going even though I hit the button for it to turn in another direction.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I LOVED this movie! It is so fun to watch over and over again. Kay Cannon did an amazing job with the screenplay, but I've already been a fan of hers so I was looking forward to watching this. It does not disappoint.
1451638450|4.0|Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan series is one of the best and most successful series in SF. It was built around the character of Miles Vorkosigan, who faced a universe with an unusual<br />set of problems. Over time, the background of how Miles came to be was filled in with stories of his parents' meeting and the time of the Vordarian Pretendership. Nevertheless, the series<br />was generally thought of as centering on Miles.<br /><br />There is a long history of literature of writers creating successful, ongoing characters, and finding themselves either bored with them (Conan Doyle's feelings towards Sherlock Holmes<br />are famous) or having exhausted the dramatic possibilities they began their series with. Miles has changed, over the Vorkosigan series, and is no longer the character Bujold began with.<br />His weaknesses are largely gone, overcome or rendered irrelevant. He is, in terms of the series, a middle aged man, married, with children, a senior figure in elite of Barrayar. He is a troubleshooter for the Emperor and has begun exerting serious influence in the Council of Counts. His physical problems are no longer central in his life and he has achieved the goals he<br />once burned to achieve. Most of the basis for drama inherent in his creator's conception of his character and circumstances have been exhausted. The Miles Vorkosigan who was a very small<br />character facing very large challenges is largely a matter of the past of the series.<br /><br />So, what's left for Bujold to write about? She took a delightful turn in A CIVIL CAMPAIGN, turning out what is, as much as anything, a comedy of manners, but that's not a trick that works<br />often. So, having spent so much time creating a world and interesting characters, it seems she's examining the possibilities in figures other than Miles.<br /><br />CAPTAIN VORPATRIL's ALLIANCE brings Ivan Vorpatril to center stage. Miles does not appear in this novel, save as an occasional offstage presence. The story centers on Ivan, with significant roles for his mother, Lady Alice, Byerly Vorrutyer, and Simon Illyan, and a medium size role for Gregor. Same universe, same background, but told from a notably different viewpoint.  Avoiding spoilers, this story is, more or less, Ivan's belated Coming-of-Age story, told in character and with a sense of humor. Ivan has always been a very different character than Miles, so he grows up in a very different way. But, their endpoints are remarkably similar in terms of the development of character, which probably says something about the nature of novels, the nature of Man, Ms. Bujold's worldview, or all these things.<br /><br />It's a good read. It's probably a much better read for those who are familiar with the series, as so much resonates against characters and points made elsewhere in the series. I enjoyed this novel more than CRYOBURN and DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, which seem to me to suffer from the problem mentioned in above; the change in Miles. It's my favorite entry in the series since<br />A CIVIL CAMPAIGN, which is my own favorite.<br /><br />Where the series goes from here is a real question. Nothing in CVA precludes more Ivan-centric stories. The ending is merely stage dressing, in character in the large sense, but not final in terms of plot logic.<br /><br />There are other possibilities in peripheral characters, as  WINTERFAIR GIFTS showed, although these are probably limited. A story centering on Elli Quinn? Elena Bothari Jesek? Bel Thorne? Taura? And, some other possibilities in the Barrayar area: Gregor, Byerly, Lady Alice and Illyan come to mind, as well, obviously, as the story of Mark. In some ways, in terms of the evolution of the saga, Mark has become a more interesting character than Miles, in that he still has major issues and challenges to overcome, although he is well on his way. There is also still potential in the interplay between Miles and Mark, although here, too, the relationship has already been laid outin some detail. And, there is always the possibility of new stories<br />set earlier in the timelime of the series. Perhaps something by way of the Count and Countess Vorkosigan's view of the man Miles has become, looking sideways at events in one of the existing stories.<br /><br />Still, we should enjoy the later stories as we can, because it's possible that the end of this series is in sight. The original conception of Miles Vorkosigan which made his stories unusual in SF and allowed the author to explore what, in SF, was an unusual set of dramatic issues, is finished, in the chronology of the series. Unless some way is found to breathe new life into Miles, we may find fewer stories published at greater intervals from here out and that would be a shame.
141659521X|2.0|I have enjoyed all of Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp books.  They have fast paced plots, realistic fights, accurate use of high tech equipment and interesting characters.  The last two books in the Mitch Rapp series, American Assassin and Kill Shot, were prequels and were passable.  The latest installment, The Last Man, is a story spun out of current event thread and is a weak addition to the series.<br /><br />Joe Rickman, an important CIA asset in Afghanistan, who knows names of agents and spies, is kidnapped. Rapp is assigned to find Rickman before he can be forced to reveal what he knows.  From the start Rapp is suspicious and as the complications pile up he becomes convinced the CIA is under direct attack.<br /><br />The story started out well and I was expecting vintage Flynn but the plot soon bogged down. While the fights and gun battles didn't disappoint the plot weighted this Rapp story down.  It was just too predictable, everything the opposite of what it seems, Mitch ignores orders, the corrupt politician and the bureaucrats too stupid to get out of the hired gun's (Mitch's) way. The ending was weak, anticlimactic, way too predictable and left several loose ends.<br />I also see a disturbing trend of using increasing doses of profanity. I assume this is to exhibit macho-ness but Flynn didn't need it in his earlier books and I wonder why he thinks he needs it now.<br /><br />Rapp has been a character who is a stone cold killer but one with a hidden vein of humanity. That humanity was sorely missed in this installment. This is a great loss for the character and the reader.  The supporting cast in The Last Man has no depth at all.  Hurley, Coleman and Kennedy all have pieces in this story be we never see more than superficial reflections of these characters.<br /><br />A new and annoying wrinkle was a constant repetition of information and catch phrases.  I got annoyed by this about mid way through the book.  Yes I know this. Don't tell me, yet again.<br /><br />I like Flynn.  His writing is tight, his characters (up till now) well written and interesting, his plots well thought out.  The Last Man was a disappointment in all these areas for me.  I hope the next installment will have the benefit of better editing and critique.  I'll read the next one but Vince is on probation.like Flynn.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|Atrocities done to millions of little children and Women. Beaten and abused, tortured and killed.<br />Hitler and his SS-troupes?  Evil is everywhere in this world! - How can a holy God (E. Alexander calls him strangely Oms) say to the reader of this book, \\"There is nothing you can do wrong\\"?  What a blasphemy in view of a suffering world! What a treachery.<br />My father had a ND-experience. Similar to the ND-story of Marvin J. Besteman, \\"My Journey to heaven\\", he also stood before  heaven's gate. And God spoke to him, \\"you will never enter the gate of heaven, unless you accept my son Jesus Christ as your Saviour and Lord\\". After 3 day in coma, he returned and the first thing he did was giving his heart, his live to Jesus, the true light. A half year later he went through the gate of heaven to meet his Saviour.<br />St. Paul tells us that we are born with evil already within us and that nothing can clean us and make us pure except Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us that in the endtime the devil will appear as an angel of light and mislead the people of this world. That's what happens through this book, producing  a deadly wrong  \\"hurrah-feeling\\"  within  thousands of readers.

B008QE9XD2|2.0|Even as a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan, first and foremost I was offended beyond belief at the trailers for this film, upon first realizing Burton's vision of one of my beloved \\"guilty pleasures\\" as a kid - the TV soap \\"Dark Shadows\\" - appeared to be a comedy. I swore I wouldn't see this dreck, but eventually caved just to see the train wreck Burton made ... only to NOT hate it as much as I thought, but also (thankfully) to find out that the film is NOT a comedy (and should not have been marketed as such by the studio). There are comedic touches and a black comedy overtone to the film, at times, to be sure - but in general, the story of a centuries-old vampire named Barnabas Collins (Depp), who is released from his coffin prison to walk among the living (and his ancestral home) again, is a tongue-in-cheek drama that is generally just not a good film ... but also not the piece of crap I thought it to be. Best seen if you're a Depp or Burton fan; best NOT seen if you are a Jonathan Frid/ original \\"Dark Shadows\\" fan.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I am very happy I bought this movie. It is a classic. The color makes it even better.<br />I love old movie make overs.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|Just started playing and so far been a fun game would recommend for people looking to kill monsters and getting items
B008MG1E4A|4.0|There was so much hype made about this book and I gave in and bought it.  It was an interesting read but it was more of a bio. of this guys life than about the whole event which took place at the compound.  Otherwise, it was a good read!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|My guiltiest guilty pleasure of the year, so far - can't help it, but had a LOT of fun with this genre-mix of old-time western meets sci-fi alien infestation flick. Daniel Craig takes himself a bit too seriously here, Harrison Ford getting it exactly right, and this is definitely a film where you have to check your brain at the door AND be willing to suspend your logic for awhile. The VERY talented supporting cast, especially, are terrific here at supporting the bigger names; without them, even with Craig and Ford starring, I don't think I would have enjoyed this as much as all. NOTE: See the extended version (2:15 minutes) over the theatrical release (1:59 minutes), if possible!

B004MC8CA2|4.0|It works okay on my tablet, but not on my husbands. I finally had to take it off of his because it kept crashing. It said that the NIV version was downloaded onto his tablet but when I tried to open it offline it said that it couldn't because it couldn't find the server. But on mine the NIV version opens just fine when I am offline. I have a Coby tablet mid-7035, his is a Genesis Ematic tablet, and I hate his. I would say download it give it a try see if it works on your device. You have nothing to lose by trying. If it works you will love having it. I love being able to read some versions of the bible offline. But they are only offering the NIV version for download through January 21st so get the app now if you want the NIV version. So go ahead give a try, I recommend it to anyone who wants a free bible app. You can't go wrong with Youversion.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The plot is entertaining, tho not particularly well-constructed.  The writing style will drive you nuts.  The kid is supposed to be a writer, but his writing is awful.  I think I wrote a lot better than that at 15.  Lots of very short sentences.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Could not BELIEVE how much I enjoyed this action comedy, but they really got it right. An homage to the classic '80s TV series as opposed to a crass update (though yeah, the film is pretty crass), Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are PERFECT as a pair of failed cops who - as a last resort to save their jobs - are sent back to high school undercover, to break up a new drug ring supplying a fresh new high to young kids. Equal parts comedy and action, the film is awesome, even to featuring cameo appearances from most of the actors from the original show (yeah, including Depp). Funny, foul-mouthed, and a truly terrific ride.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I believe everyone knows the narrative and basic symbols of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the evil queen, the poisoned apple, seven dwarfs and the huntsman.  The visual effects of this movie surpass the imagination.  The evil queen in this movie is given center stage to give the viewer a glimpse of her true evil which has never been done to this level before.  Kristen Stewart as Snow White is effective giving balance to the movie.  Well worth a look, see.
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was a very good book but it has some grammatical errors , which I found to be very strange.

B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Wahlberg did a great job acting this part but I didn't think it was as funny as led to believe. It's like hearing a joke and waiting for the punch line that never comes. And the language does not always have to be so foul for it to be good:(

B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|The series has run a bit out of steam, and here they don't even have a particularly bad-ass villain, but nonetheless this is an entertaining entry in the franchise thanks to Will Smith and especially Josh Brolin - who channels a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' character Agent K so perfectly, it's uncanny. The story is about a bad - VERY bad - alien, Boris the Animal, who escapes his maximum security prison and immediately finds a way to go back in time to kill the man who both captured him and cost him his arm - Agent K. Agent J (Smith) has to follow him back in time, and once there convince a disbelieving (yet, somehow, oddly more humane), younger K (Brolin) that he's in danger so the two of them can battle Boris together. Everything pretty much sticks to the formula, but what gets this 3-1/2 stars from me is the secret revealed at the end - the reason behind why Agent K becomes the emotionless drone he becomes later in life. It adds a sweet humanity to the film and characters that explains a few things and caps off things nicely.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|I'm so angry!! The cloud player gives you incomplete albums and then I had to manually go and fix thousands of songs that were missing. It also shuts down while I'm in the middle of playing my music. It also freezes up!! This is not what I payed for! I've had to uninstall and re-install a bunch of times already. This app could have been good but it really needs ALOT OF WORK!! I spent to many days trying to correct what the cloud player was SUPPOSED to do. Really agravated.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very funny but the begging was a little cheesy<br />Jeff Kinney needs to make more books<br />Diary of a wimpy kid is very funny
B006O6F932|5.0|This was an awesome gift for Xmas.  Keeps the kids occupied for a long time! Boys and girls love to play with this toy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great proceed to book one. Kept me on my toes. I would recommend to anyone. We will see how the movie turns out but I doubt better than the story this writer portrayed in this book.
B005LAII3A|1.0|Much as I like Colin Farrell (and the film has a great cast, period), this is one godawful mess that barely even qualifies as a remake ... considering how much they changed and violated the original story. Action sequences, overdone CGI, and (at times) a screen so overloaded with visual effects you could almost get a headache, this version takes everything that brought emotional connection to the original and tosses it into the trash can - in favor of a plotline that somehow is both lame and ludicrous at the same time (seriously, Cohaagen's reason for doing what he's doing in this version could NOT be more of a yawn!). Really, really awful.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book was great and I really felt like I was Tally while reading it. I can't wait to read the rest in this series!
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|...once you get used to non- traditional user interface. It taught me that the camera sucks on Kindle Fire HD. That is not the app's fault, of course.

B00A9C3RB8|5.0|'Hope Springs' is a movie for the 50-60 age group. Meryle Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were perfectly matched. Dialog was really true to life.  I loved the whole movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love story struggling with the aspects of the past, present, and future. Everybody has their own version of such but to get lost in a book like this and not be able to put it down is an extremely good read.
B0073U2FB2|1.0|Love alien movies, really like Emile Hirsch, REALLY like Max Minghella ... and can even check my brain at the door and just enjoy a fairly stupid action or sci-fi flick, when need be (see 'Cowboys & Aliens') - but this one strained both credibility AND my nerves. Weak writing and performances - along with a very rushed film that took no time for either story or character development - make for a tough watch, even at barely an hour and a half.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am so happy Hopeless was the last book I read in 2012 because I absolutely loved it and it was a great way to go out.<br /><br />Here's what I thought Hopeless would be about: a nice, sweet good girl falls for a \\"bad boy\\" with dark secrets, a temper, and a brooding personality and she doesn't want to fall for him up obviously ends up falling for him any way and one or both of them drastically changes and becomes a better person.<br /><br />Is that what it was like? No, not at all, it was nothing like that (thank god), it was so much better. I honestly enjoyed this so much more than either of Colleen Hoover's other books [[ASIN:1468161660 Slammed]] and [[ASIN:B008TRU9HU Point of Retreat]].<br /><br />My feelings on the story: I really loved the story despite it being nothing like I expected, in fact I think I liked it more because it was nothing like I expected. I wouldn't say the description provided in inaccurate, it just sums up the much shorter beginning part of the story and doesn't touch at all on the much larger and really fantastic second part of the story. I won't spoil the second part, but, as the description states, there is a lot of heavy subject matter and there were times that it was difficult to read, but sometimes that's what a good book does. Even though there were quite a very coincidences in the book I thought it was pretty realistic and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />My feelings on the characters: I really liked Sky, I thought she was a very real and totally relatable character. Six kind of annoyed me, but she was out of the picture pretty quickly. Breckin the Morman was great. And I thought Holder was a great male character, a good blend of good and bad guy (aka real).<br /><br />If I had to compare this to another book I would go with [[ASIN:0425266745 Easy]]. They both have great characters and they both completely surpassed my expectations.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great, action packed movie!  Can't go wrong with this great movie!  Amazing scenery!  Really funny too!  I'd like to see it again.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This album made me love this band, the old stuff is alright, but the rawness and emotion in every song is just outstanding
6305428042|5.0|I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE ON TV AND WANTED IT ON DVD.  ONE OF OUR FAVORITE HALLOWEEN MOVIES...GLAD YOU HAD THIS MOVIE AND WAS MAILED QUICKLY AND IN GREAT QUALITY.....THANKS
0345525558|4.0|I liked all the characters and especially the heroine and the story moved along well.  My only criticism is that it ended abruptly and the loose ends rushed by in a brevity uncalled for from such a beautiful story. I would have liked a more satisfying ending.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Radcliffe leaves Harry Potter behind for good, and the Hammer house of horror film logo is back on the screen for this creepy, atmospheric ghost story that relies on what made horror/suspense films of the past so great - building tension and making the audience jump, over the crap blood and gore of today's American horror films. Loved it, and even though his character doesn't give him much of an emotional range to work with, I also loved Radcliffe in it.
0385493622|5.0|This is one of the best books about math that you can find. I recommend it to any aspiring mathematician.

B008GANNIC|5.0|POD had taken plenty of time off before writing this album, and to come back into the game and not disappoint at all in the slightest.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|This movie was boring and sophomoric. Eastwood overacted and the plot was too predictable. Don't recommend it unless you're REALLY bored.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so amazing. so fun. HOW CAN THESE PEOPLE LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!!!!!!! when my mom explained to me how to use it i was addicted to it in a good way even though i only have six followers. anyways if you get it i hope you like it.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Was SO looking forward to this one, being a big fan of the original 'Alien' films, and sad to say this precursor to the \\"quadrology\\" isn't worthy of them. Visually nice, the story falls downs on itself right away; a group of scientists discover, on a far, FAR distant planet, a link to the origins of mankind, questioning the whole God thing and all, and are financed for an expedition to go and check out and gather the possible evidence. Once there they discover a lot more than they wanted to, including learning that the entire human race is in imminent danger of being wiped out. Sadly (especially sad, consider Ridley Scott directed this), the script and plot both contain holes big enough to drive a tank through, and as always in such films it is BEYOND AGGRAVATING to watch characters - supposedly highly-trained and educated scientists - do the truly idiotic/lame things they do, here, to get themselves into trouble. Just a very unsatisfying watch, even with good performances by a couple of cast members, because you can't get past some of the dumb things both story and characters do.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very fun and entertaining wish it was longer tho beat it in less than 24 hours<br /><br />great story line and puzzles to solve
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I did not expect to like this as much as I do.  The music transports me, it makes me feel like I am sitting on the dock next to some slow moving water on a hazy, lazy afternoon.  That's quite a departure from the cold snowy weather of Northeast Ohio in the dead of winter.

B005LAII62|4.0|In his small, sleepy town Norman is seen as a bit of a freak; a young boy who talks to himself, seems a bit of a nerd, and therefore has no friends and spends a great deal of his time alone. But Norman isn't talking to himself - he's talking to ghosts, specters he's been able to see, especially, since the death of his grandma (who talks to him regularly at home, often keeping Norman company as he watches TV). Even his own parents and self-absorbed teenage sister don't believe him - think him odd - but when his ability to communicate with the dead calls Norman into service against an oncoming supernatural uprising that threatens his entire town, Norman gathers a few rag-tag buddies to vanquish the undead and break a centuries-old curse ... in what is a truly engaging, funny, and surprisingly good animated film complete with a few twists to the plot you do NOT see coming. Even the animation looks cool.
030759565X|5.0|I adore Deb's blog. I know her recipes have been thoroughly vetted, and the end results rarely disappoint. Her cookbook is a wonderful collection of classic recipes with a twist, and the pictures and narrative make it a great read. Make the lemon bars!

B0084IG8TM|2.0|I'd heard just enough comparisons of this film (and novel) to the film/novel 'Battle Royale' (forever on my Top 10 favorite films of all time list), so had to take a look. Overlong, pretentious, and emotionally void, 'The Hunger Games' is set in a far-off future in the nation of Pandem, which is divided into twelve districts. Every year, a pair of young people - one male, one female - are chosen by lottery, one pair per district, to participate in the Hunger Games, where they are all dumped onto a private reserve and forced to fight each other to the death - the winner determined only by the last person left alive, while everything is recorded and shown around the nation for all to see. Katniss Everdeen (a fairly wooden Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to go this year, in the place of her much-younger sister, and her male counterpart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) - seemingly more brawn than brains - joins her in the forced games of death ... which, ultimately in this film, aren't all that exciting or even involving (with a few exceptions) when you don't really give a hang about the main characters. Kat and Peeta, for me, had ZERO chemistry together on-screen, and the entire film in fact comes across with an air of sterility and coldness that keeps you from getting emotionally attached to anyone or anything. And its nothing like 'Battle Royale' unless you remade it, TOTALLY Americanized it, and THEN molded the entire thing for the atypical 'Twilight' fan. Maybe THAT best describes it.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This was s a pretty good movie!  I probably won't buy it, but was good to rent.  Will wait for it to come on TV to watch again.
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter's favorite Christmas gift was this high school playset! She loves it! She is 8 and had no problem setting it up herself. I can hear her in her room talking to her monster high dolls while they go to school. So cute!
B008OOYALE|5.0|if you are a fan of dragons, you will love this game. You build up and create a dragon world.  Be aware it can be very addictive.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing, sometimes i felt it dragged on, but later found out why it was important. I really love the storyline and the characters personalities.
B00632HWOG|5.0|very nice, does what it says, I enjoy using this come in handy will tell everyone about it, keep up the good work
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Tried to make my 100th for the year a kick-ass one, and boy was it; LOVE this film! When Loki (see 'Thor') strives to bring an army of demons (who, once seen, give new meaning to the word \\"bad-ass ugly\\") through a portal to attack earth, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a band of superheroes - Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, Captain America, Black Widow, and one very grudging Incredible Hulk - together to save mankind. Joss Whedon's script blends the seriousness and humor together with near perfection, and the kick-ass finale between the gang and Loki and his butt-ugly mutants in and over New York City is worth watching the film for ALONE. One of my favorites of the year, and a guaranteed MUST-SEE if you haven't seen it already!
1419705849|5.0|My son has read the book several times already. He loves it just as much as all the previous ones in the series. The storyline, however, seems to remind him a lot of the &#34;Ugly Truth&#34;.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Goes great with all monster high dolls. We use it with the high school doll house. My daughter has a lot of fun with this.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. I have read well over a thousand books in my life. Kate's description of events has a way of lingering in one's mind. Her characters are delightful - human, many faceted, complicated at times and memorable. It was hard to put the book down. Even at the end. I did not want the lives of these characters to disappear from my view. Highly recommended.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|maybe the best one I've read yet!  from beginning to end its Reacher at his best. They usually seem to get slower and redundant as a series progresses, but not this one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|very nice, does what it says, I enjoy using this come in handy will tell everyone about it, keep up the good work
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I gave this novel four stars because I found it engaging and literary. I will admit, I have a soft spot for literature which is self referential, and this novel did not disappoint in this regard. McEwan is described as one of few authors who has achieved commercial as well as critical success and this book is a good indicator of why this is the case: he blends intrigue, strong characters and complex ideas while never compromising literariness, which I appreciate. If anyone picks up this book because they are more interested in the machinations of spy novels, put it back on the shelf or don't click to buy it, because you will be let down. However, if you love reading about writing, becoming an adult and learning to deal with the minefield of love, the inferiority complex of England in the postwar 1970's period, and the occasional burst of wit and insight, this book is for you. It does not rise to the level of &#34;Atonement,&#34; but this was never the aim. If you like McEwan, you will enjoy this book.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Bought for my 6 year old.  He loves it.  Can be challenging to build structures.  Still fun.  He has gotten surprisingly good at aiming with the catapult.  It has been fun at our house.

B003Q6CUAI|3.0|Great book. Diet works. Lots of valuable information<br /><br />Horrible in terms of the to.do-part. Hard to find the essential information, even when one knows it is there. Maybe it works better on print, but it is certainly not optimized for kindle.<br /><br />But I lost the weight I wanted to loose and I am happy for that.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this- not a great ending. All in all a great choice with a twist for sure. Would recommend to friends.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|Great scenery but the plot is subpar. The Bourne series is too one sided in painting these balck ops as totally evil. Would have been better if it left the viewer with a more complicated choice whether the programs they talk about are good or not.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This is a great book for people who like mysteries. Lemony Snicker is a great author.  Go buy this book!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! It was funny, sad, heartwarming, it made me laugh and want to cry. There are predictable parts  but then there were parts you never saw coming. Overall just a really good read.

B00400NHRO|5.0|Well written with strong emotional content.  Tough and truthful---scary for new interns and devistating for newbies!  Possibly will deter some readers from considering medicine as a career.!  Yet all who have been closely tied to the medical community will see the text as truthful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very entertaining. It was a nice easy read and before I knew it I was on to the next book. I can't believe it took me this long to get in on this series.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|Good 'back to the future' type of story. Nice development of how 'K' became the dry, cynical guy that he is in the first two. Almost as good as the first MIB.
B001FVD65O|4.0|Bruce Willis is witty and serious, saving the day. All of the Die Hard movies are entertaining, but hopefully new one coming out is much better.

B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|After my first game, the screen flipped upside-down, no matter which way I turn it...effectively rendering the game completely useless.  I am not the only one to experience this problem. Read the reviews. Fix it now, or stop charging for a defective game.  Kindle Fire HD

B00APUQRPC|5.0|Typical child reconnecting with parent story. The usual 'doesn't fall far from the tree' idea. Good if you happen to like baseball.
B000I62JAK|5.0|This movie was so silly, but so funny.  I hope the models out there did not take offense of the over-dramatization of their profession.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|There were periods of time when the movie seemed to drag.  The plot was interesting and the ending was a bit predictable but not until almost the end of the film.  It was a bit bloody at times too.  It's worth watching.<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br />You can take a 15min bathroom or popcorn break when you see the farm house and not miss much. :)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It is the best book since book one you would love and I mean love it the best awe some!!!

B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book. Fast paced. A little scary and horrifying at times. Good mystery though. Left me wondering how Ben could be so gullible though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can certainly see why the book was such a hit. The novel struck many chords and many themes (teenage anguish, love, work, poverty and more), was an easy and quick read, as well as full of action.<br /><br />Ms. Collins built a fantastical and believable world where the United States is no more and instead the country is now called Panem which is run from \\"The Capital\\" and divided into 12 districts. The story progresses quickly and fluently with well defined characters who have lame names. Don't tell me that the baker's son is named Peeta (Pita) by accident.
1592402690|5.0|Interesting book on some of the behind the scenes of making music. The tricks and trials of making some of the innovative sounds in music. Interesting stories and tidbits of some of the recording sessions. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my new favorite book, because it was heartwarming, sad, and humorous. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. It was worth the $10.99 I payed for it!

B009CG955Y|5.0|wonderful story to tell the kids.  video is great on my New kindle fire.  worked great in the car driving 11 hours.
B009O2XY12|4.0|It's not really difficult. It is a bit of a teaser in that you get to a certain level then it wants you to pay to proceed. I understand they want to make money, but I am not that interested to buy it.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This App does everything advertised.  Very easy to enter bills.  Very easy to setup reminders.  Works great on my ASUS TF300.  I would give it five stars if you could put a web address with the bill to enable direct website access to make a bill payment from within theApp.  Would also be great if the App could be locked and password protected.  I'm able to lock this App with App Locker that came on the ASUS.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It's amazingly addictive it had a deep hold on me. The graphics were amazing and it dragged me in. I loved the storyline but the detective seemed stupid in the beginning. Not appropriate for little kids even if they say they can handle it don't trust them it's to scary. The music goes great with each scene it's used for. All in all it fantastic. The most amazing thing I ever seen when it comes to games like this. And I've seen a lot.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Glad to see that Grisham is back to what he knows best - the law - it was very good and worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazing book! Loved all the twists and turns! Never knew what was going to happen next! Great read for all!
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I'm very glad that the soundtrack versions of these songs, most of them, are the complete versions of the song and not the snippet you would hear in the movie.  The one thing I don't like about this album is that &#34;Right Round&#34; is not the movie version.  There's some chick singing, which I could deal with... But the voice of Skylar Astin [Jesse] is missing from this piece, and for me at least, that is what makes that rendition of that song so good.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Do not judge this album by their hits.  Ok, it's hard for Steve and the boys to live up to the 20 or so songs that we always listen to.  Their body of work is so great that it is easy to dimiss this album as just so so...<br /><br />Taking a deeper look at this record and not in the context of their past hits, you can find some great music here.  A couple of songs are throw aways but for the most part, this is really an awesome album.  The music is great, the vocals are as emotionally chaged as ever and it's really fun to listen to.<br /><br />Remember, when Aerosmith experienced a resugence of intrest in the early 80s, everybody just wanted to hear \\"Same old song and dance\\" and \\"walk this way\\" from their earlier albums.  Here they are again blazing a new trail.  Give the record a chance and you won't be dissappointed.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Although the link is fine I rare use Linkedin.  There are lots of colleagues on my list but we don't converse with this media.
B009AY04A8|2.0|I had pretty much given up on Nevosoft games because they are all the same--bunch of boring dialogue, unappealing graphics, loading, loading, loading...  I think this one must have been a faotd when I decided to get it since I love ho adventure games.  I was not surprised when it was more of the same.  I guess the individual searches and games aren't too bad but my finger was getting tired from tapping through the seemingly endless dialogue.  I can't say anything about the story because the talking was too boring to care what I was missing.  It just boggles my mind how people keep rating these games high when gems out there like Alawar's Weird Park and Mumbojumbo's Midnight Mysteries get the shaft because they cost a little more but are SO worth it (btw, Weird Park is truly only $ 0.99 now--get it!)  Another great one is Big Fish's Enigmatis but, for some reason it's not available here--I got it from Google play.  Also, another Alawar game here Stray Souls with the picture of the creepy doll--outstanding.<br /><br />The only reason I would recommend this game, or pretty much any nevosoft game, is to point out how truly awesome these other games are and how much more imagination and work went into them.
B003B02OQ4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.  The characters were well developed to the point that you felt you knew them personally.  The story kept me interested from beginning to end.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants an interesting, suspenseful and fun read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very, very addictive. The ultimate time waster!  And if you buy all the hints it could be very expensive.  I love it.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Pretty Good.  I am a fan of Van Halen's music but not Van Halen.  These guys are big headed and vain.  They fire Sammy Hagar and hire Gary whoever for one record.  They rehire Roth a couple of times and then fire Michael Anthony.  The Van Halen brothers need an attitude check!<br /><br />That being said, this is a pretty good album.  The songs are fun and have some good lyrics.  Roth is a wonderful front man and has returned to form.  The Van Halen's are great doing what they do best, making music.  This is a really good return for VH!!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Well-written...Witty...Funny...Perfection! Even though it is a comedy you learn alot about life and relationships. I highly recommend all eight seasons.
B000FC146C|5.0|I could feel the pain, joy, fear, and ecstasy as though I was the characters in the book. The world of Meggie put me in a trance of despair and hope.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|A great game and very cute. Wonderful graphics. BUT WHEN ARE THE NEW LEVELS COMING???!!!?!?!??? Keep going zeptolab!!! Waiting for more games!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best series i have ever seen. Period authenticity is unparalleled. I am anxiously awaiting the release of season 3.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never wanted to read Hunger Games, but after hearing about how great it was from friends, relatives and strangers, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It was easy to read and get sucked into the great story line.  I couldn't help but fall in love with Katniss and root for her to win.  I can't wait to start reading book 2!
B005DESVPO|5.0|Big fan! Brings back old time and new ways to love the blues while you rock on, a great future for this fine music maker!
B002N5N5R0|4.0|Great series!  Can't want to get the whole series.  I  have 1-3.  So riveting hope it goes on for ever.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great Product and Enjoyed the Trilogy. I would definitely recommend it if you like Batman Movies and are a comic fan
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My counselor recommended this book to read at one of my sessions. I haven't actually read through most of it yet. The transaction acquiring this book went very smoothly though.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great movie, money well spent on the rental. Once again Clint proves he is an actor that appeals to all age groups. I am buying the blu-ray.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Too technical in some spots but very entertaining to read. I enjoyed it, especially the ending. Kept my interest completely.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely adored reading this trilogy! I couldn't put this book down, finished it in two days flat! This book alone had my blood pumping throughout the entire read, from happy to excited, and sad to anxious and angry, I loved it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Don't like paying for games, but this one hooked me. Good puzzles... not too easy and not too hard. Would like to play the sequel.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|This movie is an amazingly scary movie.  It seems to be going along fine and then BAM without even knowing it a scary part comes up.  My wife and I loved this movie and can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B009HELT3C|3.0|One of the better in the series of the trilogy.  Worth the price of the rental.  Good movie, and great ending.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A bit dissapointed<br /> it ended so quick. I really enjoyed this game. Hope to get the sequel it talked about.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great format for solitaire. Easy to use. The only downside is the little ads before the games begin but otherwise a great game.
B003XRELEI|5.0|Just a great book by a great author.  Definitely a must read if you are trying to get into Vonnegut's works
B000VZBCWE|5.0|Bought DVD version for a gift. Already have bluray at home. Fantastic concert. Queen at their best, including live aid.
1579128955|4.0|I bought it because I'm writing a novel in which the main character wants to explore all of the elements as he goes about his daily life. This is the only book I could find with this information. I love the author's humorous and colorful writing style.<br /><br />My only problem is that it's hard to read white type on black backgrounds, and every page is this way. I knew that before I bought it, so it obviously didn't trouble me too much.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game to play everyone should get it great to when your bored and need something to do get it
B007THA4FI|4.0|First off, I have never read a single Harry Potter book, nor seen any of the movies.  I did not purchase this book because I was a fan of the author.  The Harry Potter series doesn't interest me, and from the reviews I read before buying this book, the author completely deviated from her norm here.  That being said, this book had its moments.  All in all, it was very good, albeit depressing, however, it was steeped in reality.  The author excels at making you feel for the characters, some good, some bad, some downright pathetic.  The reasons I did not give it 5 stars were twofold: first, there was a point about midway through the book where it dragged a little and I started to lose interest, but it did pick up and the ending was very fast-paced.  I couldn't wait to finish it to find out what happened to the characters. Secondly, there were so many characters that there were times it was hard to keep track of them (especially on my Kindle; it's much easier to flip back to a pages in a book when you need to go back and check on something).  I would definitely read other books by this author, but not any Harry Potters.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The animations are nice. Gameplay is smooth. So far the game is easy, which is not a bad thing. :-)
B000063WDH|5.0|ok,  their first album is the best.  you kind of have to have a particular taste for the black keys
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We have watched this at least 4 times now, not counting when it first came out. Very good 3D. Highly recommend!
B004GYY714|5.0|The options available on local radio are severely limited where I live.  TuneIn has freed me from slanted news and editorializing.  I can go anywhere on the web and select what I want to hear.  I can take it with me and plug into my ears or my car.  News, music, talk, multiple genres.  This app is fantastic!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|i like the bing browser myself, but google was all that the apps had so i got my original favorite and that's google. it does everything i want it to do: google.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The story of a boy. A remarkable boy who could manipulate the folk to do what he thought was square. This is the story.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|oh Rod, you never change.  glad it wasn't all your crooner stuff.  fun, upbeat, a great addition to my Christmas music
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Absolutely a blast! Great game, easy to learn but the variable setup offers endless ways for the game to be played. Absolutely worth the price.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Some people have issues with the second season of Spartacus since the original actor of Spartacus passed away and a new actor stepped in for the second season. Have no fear, it's still great. Takes a bit to get used to the new actor, but I was fully able to enjoy him as Spartacus. It's bloody, it's violent, it's rated R- It's a great series. Very enjoyable and one that I will watch over and over again on rainy days.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|i was always a fan of ultimate guitar when i went online so i knew that i just had to get the app for them. it works just as well and it's nice to have tabs on the new tabs on the go.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Twas good. Had a hard time putting it down. I was even reading at work. Would recommend it to others.
B0002O06N0|5.0|yeah, they're ok.  my daughter loves, a little on the funky side for me, but i do like some of their stuff
B0063IH60K|4.0|It would be easier and quicker to play if the face-up cards aligned horizontally, rather than cascading downward. Also, it would be helpful if the cards turned up at the top of the screen were separated with a little more between them and the aces.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great program to allow my Kindle to play with the Big Boys - I can send items to the Kindle and save them for reading later - love it!
B006BAEQB2|2.0|This is too depressing for the already depressing weather and after Christmas season.  However, it was well written and well researched.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book was catchy and full of suspension. This book also has a very cool way o f putting the book (in perspective s).
B008JFUUIA|4.0|good, can be a little predictable.  Pitch Perfect will make you laugh and is geared more toward teen audiences. Fun.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|What if you found a way to go back into time before the assassination of JFK? And what if you could stop it? Would you? What are the implications of changing the past? And what if you fall in love with someone in 1960's Texas?<br /><br />This and more you'll find inside of 11/22/63. Lots of details about the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, life in the late 50's and early 60's and decisions that one man must make.<br /><br />Definitely a fun read, engaging, asks some interesting questions.<br /><br />The only other Stephen King novel I have read is The Stand. This book makes me want to dip into his books a bit more.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Love staying connected while away for an easy weekend with my Kindle Fire and these apps!!! Makes time away less stressful and easy to chat with friends, co-workers and even bloggers!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Given as a gift, and watched it together....wonderful movie, great graphics, expressions.  And her hair flowed as it it were real locks! How do they do that? Your kid will love it for their collection.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The game was suspenseful and amazing in my opinion, but there was that ending that deducted points. I just wish there was an Enigmatic sequel. :  )
B00066SGOK|4.0|you just can't go wrong with john coltrane.  the cover was a little on the weathered side, but recording great
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good love story. The love that Katie and Alex shared after all they went through is amazing. Great book. Love Nicholas Sparks books.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love seeing what others are doing out in the WWW - entertaining to repost and share finds with friends and family
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter and she love it, It was a great move, Will watch it again. Love it
B007MG360G|1.0|Fun at first for kid but then wants money for a cheesie game plus some wasted time also is not very fun at all
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|My children received this movie for christmas, and we really enjoyed watching it as a family. :) it was a fantastic \\"feel good\\" movie! Basically, being their first movie in a great while, the movie is about the Muppets making a come back. After several years split up, someone threatens to tare down the old Muppet Studios to drill under it for oil! One dire fan reunites the Muppets (and love interest of Piggy and Kermit) to raise the money to save the Muppet Studios.<br />The film was adorable, and very amusing. Korny.. but aren't all Muppets?<br />If you get the chance, pause the film. The pause screen is very enjoyable (or the Intermission ) .<br />Enjoy!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Pretty annoying piano app ... well, annoying if you're not the one playing hahaha ... I find myself trying and retrying to beat my score ... I like it. It's free.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Romeo and Juliet mixed with Twilight. The smart, independent heroine discovers she's not so smart and independent without her hot, rich vampire boyfriend. I tried to finish it but just couldn't.
B0086700CM|5.0|My girls love this game. They constantly run my kindle battery down.  I've even managed a few high scores too
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is an excellent new series, my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I usually sit and watch television while doing needlework but I couldn't with this series.  Kinda of reminds me of 24.
141659521X|5.0|The way Flynn tell the story and twist it near the end gave reader such as me a surprise ending! I like it.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I love this series! I can't wait to get started on the second season.  This show really makes you think!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|a regular run-of-the-mill stack/matching game but it does add some search-and-find puzzles in the mix. nice graphics and i find myself playing this a lot.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I would have said I loved it if some of the tweaks provided had been permanent, but they were not.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The books are well written and well thought out. Fun to read; an adult 's Hunger Games in that way, but less need to suspend disbelief.<br />Will buy future novels by this author.
B004S5FVJS|5.0|This is the third and arguably the best of the David Baldacci's highly imaginative and successful Camel Club series. To understand the series you should know a bit about the bizarre collection of members of the Camel Club:<br /><br />* Oliver Stone - an alias for a retired clandestine CIA operative who maintains a church cemetery in Washington and lives in the caretaker's cottage in the cemetery grounds.<br />* Rheuben Rhodes - a former DIA worker and marksman who now works unloading trucks.<br />* Caleb Shaw -  a twin PhD who works in the rare book Wing of the Library of Congress and has a penchant for wearing 19th Century fashion.<br />* Milton Farb - an obsessive-compulsive prodigy with an eidetic memory who can remember cards and numbers and can win extremely large amounts of money at Casinos.<br />* Alex Ford - (occasional member) a Secret Service agent who is a member of the President's security squad.<br />* Annabelle Conroy - (new member) a compulsive thief who runs scams on people and Casinos to steal large amounts of money.<br /><br />In this adventure Annabelle has conned vicious Casino king Jerry Bagger out of millions. Stone and his colleagues Reuben, Milton, and Caleb marshal all their resources to protect Annabelle.<br /><br />At the same time someone is slowly killing members of Stone's old clandestine squad one by one and is zeroing on Stone, who has to revert to his old trade to save his life and some of his old colleagues.<br /><br />As usual Baldacci weaves a devious tale of how this mostly amateur group deal with a range of dangerous happenings, revenge, conspiracy and murder which are the core of all of the great Camel Club series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a great book, I laughed, cried, and got angry!! I could not put it down. I fell hard for Sky and Holder their banter and chemistry was just so addicting.<br /><br />This book really tore with my emotions and as a mother of a 3 year old girl I really got emotional. The second I finished this book I walked into my daughters room who was sleeping and just kissed her and watched her peacefulness.<br /><br /> I more then live this book I am in love with it!! I definitely recommend this book and all of Colleen's books!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Unable to figure out how to change the time.  It always tells the time in some other place.  Two more.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|wow.  I watched it last night and now, the next morning, I'm still thinking about it. What an interesting, insightful look into the life of someone who to many might 'just' be known as one of the Beatles.  George Harrison was certainly one-fourth of the greatest rock band of all times, but he was also an accomplished artist on his own, and most importantly, he was an interesting, thoughtful person, searching for the answers to life's many questions.<br /><br />Scorsese does more than just assemble old clips and current interivews - he somehow makes George's spirit come alive again, making us realize how much the world lost when he died - and also reminding us of the wonderful body of work he left for us to enjoy and be inspired by for years to come.  Well done!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Annoyingly fun to play. And maybe I'll have more coins when in some with this review.  If you v have v supreme download v it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|It's a simple black case which does what it describes to do - it's not fancy, but it does what it's supposed to do so that the screen doesn't get scratched.  The stand is nice.  it's a no-frills case.
030758836X|1.0|Requested and received this book for Christmas.  It was on list after list and seemed to be highly recommended.  Wish I had read the reviews before I asked for it.  Could have used that money for a Starbucks card.<br />Like many others, I stuck with it thinking it would have some sort of resolution.  Certainly had potential. How very, very disappointing and a total waste of my time. I will never pick up a book by this author again.<br />I don't understand this trend with authors and editors to leave the reader hanging. When I plunk down good money and invest my time, I want a story worthy of all the hype.  This one does not deliver.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love this movie. I don't normally watch movies over again but this is worth many viewings. I love Judi Dench and the story just fits with the problems of retirement and aging.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really spoke to me. I had a really difficult teenage life and sometimes Charlie expressed things I could never find the words for. It meant a lot to me.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My 7 year old loved this, we bought Star Wars for the second time and he enjoyed the building pieces.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|While this book may have been shocking upon publication, Reality Television has taken care to tame it into a kinder, gentler look into the hijinks of restaurants from Europe to Tokyo but most notably New York City.  As the writer confines in us \\"People confuse me.  Food doesn't.\\"  That is the recurring theme in this book.  The writer's relationship with food is sometimes reverential, sometimes dismissive but always in the forefront of his mind and his words.<br /><br />The write spends a ridiculous amount of time reinforcing the vernacular we, the reader, already presume to know about the business and introduces us to more.  Much of what is described may be a bit more colorful or offensive than one might believe possible from their favorite restaurant or watering hole.  Many may presume such behaviors are reserved for chain restaurants where a chain smoking executive chef in a food splattered uniform would be de rigor.  Not so, says our writer.  Although smoking is now banned in New York City restaurants, one wonders how much may have changed in the more than a decade since this was first published.<br /><br />If just the mention of some place or thing familiar makes a reader more invested in a book, then that moment came for me, with a smile, when approximately halfway through there is mention of Big Barry's on Long Island.  A small restaurant chain from my childhood memories, immediately brought a involuntary knowing nob.  Just  one line slipped in, and that brought made this story closer to my frame of reference.<br /><br />The ubiquitous \\"Big Foot\\" here is not some mythical creature who leaves behind massive indentions in the mud but is never actually seen.  Instead he is a not named restauranteur with many lessons to teach an eager learner.  Most significant of these are that loyalty and honesty are rewarded in a business often hostile and uneven.<br /><br />The best bit of advise in this book is to check the cleanliness of the bathroom.  It makes sense.  If the common areas, such as the public bathroom, are not kept clean then imagine what is happening in the areas behind the swinging kitchen door.  You know that door.  It is the one that you cannot help but notice but cannot catch but a sliver or a glimpse behind.<br /><br />Clearly an interesting read.  A love affair with food and the restaurant business without any sappy muzak in the background.  You won't be turned off eating out.  You might look differently at the wait staff wondering what they were fed, or not fed, from the kitchen before their shift began.  You might wonder if the bartender is signaling out specific customers for deferential treatment.  You might speculate whether the chef was pleased or not, which is the more likely of the two, to have been called out of the kitchen to stop by a table of VIPs.  When you taste something sublime, you might just ponder the steps taken to bring you this memorable bite.e common areas, such as the public bathroom, are not kept clean then imagine what is happening in the areas behind the swinging kitchen door.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|Even for a \\"non-religious\\" person, as myself, the question of time was portrayed in a thought provoking way. I would recommend this book to anyone that questions why am I here?
B007704HO6|5.0|I'm really a Ken Follet and Lee Child fan, but I sometimes read a bit of non-fiction too.  I have no idea what made me buy this particular book, but I could not put it down any easier than any of my usual favorites.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game! The only problem I have with it is the fact that you basically need to buy diamonds which I am not interested in personally.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|not even worth the 1.99 for this movie. Not funny at all! It was a bad Family guy episode with a stuffed bear!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|We are watching it again.  My husbands favorite out of all of the mission impossible movies...in great shape..good purchase for sure
B007MDB548|4.0|Ok, so if you are in your 30s like me you will see a  lot of story gaps HOWEVER if you are under maybe 8 (?) you won't notice them at all. My daughter really enjoys it and we don't mind watching it with her. Overall, cute movie. Not a life changing experience but definitely a cute story.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This is a movie about the holucaust. This is a story about friendship. Although it is possible that the children may have not been able to forge this friendship in a \\"real\\" camp because the guards would have been patroling the premesis, never the less it is a story abut 2 boys who become friends. One happens to be Jewish and a prisoner and the other is the son of a man who wants to destroy the Jews.<br />What happens at the end of the movie is heartbreaking.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It has a good message but the book is a little boring. Good quick read. Probably wouldn't read it again.
B0091REZMW|5.0|awesome game. can get repetitive but it is definitely fun. love the full moon stuff and has all of the old sxhool movie monsters including creature from the black lagoon
B005PTYP70|5.0|My son and husband loved these movies.  They were in top condition even though the case looked a little worn
B007REW8AC|5.0|It was shipped fast and CD was packed safely so it would not get broken. I love the CD! It's great!
B009POCG2C|5.0|I loved this movie. I am a fan of clint, amy and justin. This is a movie about a daughter and father relationship. He taught her everything he knew about scouting. She becomes interested in another scout ( justin) and they have contests to see how much she knows about baseball. One of the questios is about the 4 20 game winners who Lose in the world series. That answer is of course is the orioles vs Pittsburgh.Pittsbrgh beat them 4-3 to become champs.<br />This is one of my favorite baeball movies I just had to bring it home.
B00913DPW2|5.0|great price. great challenge. the graphics were enchanting and it definitely was creepy. I got frustrated at some points but eventually figured things out. I loved how it was challenging but doable. the story and format was engaging and I would love to see many more from this developer. this is not for a person who wants an easy game. you will have to think and be patient and observant. love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|Even though no one will ever win this game, I absolutely love it! Right now I suck, but I continue to get better and better. At least I'm running off of bridges now instead of getting ate by monkeys...lol.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very much enjoy thegame.the suspense was thrilling... i even bought it thats how hooked i am... graphics were also very good. overall this is a great game that will continuously keepyou entertained.
B009ZE27US|3.0|This scanner is cool for a laugh or conversation starter. Be careful though. If you are uptight about your age you might find yourself getting very angry. It is Not accurate at all.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I loved this app. FREE on 12/31.  The animated stick figures were adorable.. But.... would not let me past level two. I tried uninstalling and restarting several times with no luck. Finally deleted it :( I guess it is not completely ready for kindle fire.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book cover to cover.  It makes you understand just a little more of what our guys go through and why they are like they when home.<br /><br />The author writes in such a way that is understood and just sounds like a normal guy.  No fluff, just they way it was.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent the 2nd time too.  I read the series way too fast the first time!  It was just as good time.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|My son is 7 and can not build any of the structures that are on the cards. I stepped in and tried to help, even moved the game to a sturdy table top. He could not build any of the cards, and I had success with less than half. The pieces do not balance well to begin with, and when you have to stack them like a T and put a bird on one side and a block on the other, it is almost impossible to do with out knocking the entire structure over! I love to play Jenga and pride myself in having steady hands, but this is just ridiculous! My son was so frustrated, he cried, which in turn made me want to cry. I dont feel that this product was tested before it was marketed. And it definitely is not suitable for a 5 yr old as stated on the box!<br /><br />From a kids view, it would be 5 stars just for the thrill of building your own angry birds, but if they see the cards first, and try to build one, it drops to 1 star real quick, so I gave it 2 stars, because after a few days, they will try to play it again. There is NO educational value, unless you are trying to teach \\"self control\\" in high stress situations! How ever, the toy is durable (even after being thrown by an angry child, the blocks dont crack). Over all, since I am the one who has to build what ever he wants to knock down, it would get no stars if that was an option!<br /><br />If you are still going to purchase this, do yourself a favor and throw away the cards and instructions and consider it a play set, and go free style!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded this game last night and my daughter played until her battery died. With her kindle charged up she has been playing all morning. It's addictive.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is fun for a while.  But with no badges and limited word choices it can get boring. I had no idea that you could even earn badges. That would def extend my attention.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/2012 ..... The game has been updated and now I am really enjoying it. ..I have all the great features that I wanted! Changed rating to 5 stars.  The only problem is that now my friends aren't playing it anymore:(
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|First one in the series that I thought was not good.  Started out convoluted and confusing.  Got better towards the end.
1416955070|1.0|I've tried twice to read this.  I stopped reading in the nightclub the first time.  A relative enjoyed it and said I just needed to read further.  So, I tried again.  I got as far as the snake beast in her house.  I can't go on, reading it is like work, not pleasure.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what it is, but this book feels 'empty'.  Excess adjective (ly) usage interrupts the flow, I can name that as one technicality.  The dialogue is stilted and annoying at points.  And I don't really like the main character.  She's not 'real' to me.<br /><br />Hard to sum up.  Neat idea, 'empty' reading.  For all the words, there's not much substance here.<br /><br />To give you an idea of my urban fantasy standard, I haven't been happy with most leading ladies since Anita Blake stepped past Book 9.  Sookie's world is cool, but damsels in distress annoy me.  Harrison was ok for about 3 books. Jordan, Martin, Sanderson -- good stuff.  Well, Martin is fantastic.<br /><br />This, this is blah.  I'm not going to check this one out on Overdrive a third time.
0385341008|5.0|Humor, romance (but not too cheesy), and a historical setting make for a wonderful read. I highly recommend this novel!
B0086700CM|5.0|No matter what device you have this is a really cool game. It is simple to learn yet hard to master. Can you make it to 4 million points?
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I'm a big Rod Stewart fan and I really loved this CD. Think next year a lot of my friends will be getting it for Christmas. Its a great pick me up any time of the year.. I could listen to it year around and I' m sure I will
B00APUQRPC|5.0|My son and I were trying to decide on a movie to watch.  He picked this one, I thought I would like it, but was unsure about him (24 years old).  To my surprise he liked it very much.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as the first book,a bit slower paced.still interesting. You will get go hooked on going on to read the next book in the series to see how it all ends.
B001I45UFC|4.0|&#34;It is a great book &#34; my daughter loved it very much. She loved the part when Lucy first went thru the wardrobe into magical kingdm of Narnia.

B00785P2QC|3.0|It starts out good in the very beginning but you'll learn that it takes a very long time to get enough credits without buying them. And also it seems that most of your goals are to advertise the game for them
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I love this game I only wish they had more expansions a game I spend hours playing and is still fun and fresh every time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I`'ve ever read. Couldn't stop reading and often read till late into the night. Totally loved it
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Really enjoyed these. Easy read but interesting. So glad someone recommended these to me. If you like a little mystery, a little sci fi, and a bit of war, download these!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Kindle Fire isn't really designed to be a camera, so this application works, but taking pictures in general is a pain.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you Like raunchy humor (combination of Family Guy and Southpark), this movie is a must see!<br />The only problem is this version is the R rated not the Unrated.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I'm assuming the people leaving favorable ratings have never seen &#34;Sleeping with the enemy&#34;.  THIS BOOK IS A HUGE JOKE! Can't believe this was actually published.
0439023521|5.0|Loved every minute! I have read all three books 3 times! Cant wait to read them again! But I did just realize that Cinna and Portia were also caracters in Shakespeare's Antony and Chleopatra! How exciting!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play this every day with my daughter. Its a great game and a way to keep in touch with your teen kids.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I down loaded this because it was free.  Holy Cow, I'm so addicted to this game now.  Totally fun, clever and entertaining.  Works well on my Kindle Fire.
0446677450|4.0|i bought this book because i had an assignment to do, but i enjoyed the read and i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a fun way to learn about basic economics
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Having been a gamer since the late eighties, I have seen this industry change. Now we live in an era of manufactured shooters appealing to the mass market. Fortunatley there are some Mainstream games, indy titles, and niche games that show the true capability of a video game is about. That is to tell a story while taking you to that world. Video games are special in that you are the one who controls the character, you make the decisions, and it is your story. And the best of these games move you emotionally on levels that others cannot.<br /><br />Instead of Shooting nameless soldiers while being a nameless soldeir with no connection, I chose Persona 4 Golden over the latest Call of Duty. It is a decision that I am happy about, and mind you I have played the original PS2 version nearly four years prior. This is a game that is worthy of a port this early.<br /><br />What this game does well it makes you feel like your living in the Small town of Inaba. With it's excellent story and its immersive gameplay, the game makes you feel you are in this world. The basic story of this game is you play a transfer student who goes to live with his uncle and cousin for a year while his parents are away overseas on buisness. In the meantime he tries to fit in in school, and befriends several students who become his bestfriends. With this going on, a series of murders occur, and you and your new friends embark on a murder investigation. This involves discovering the ability to enter another world through television. You utitlize entities called Personas to battle creatures called Shadows. From here the story carry outs.<br /><br />I will not go into much detail about the gameplay as there are a lot of gameplay mechanics to this and would take a long time to list. But during the course of the game, you spend part of the game in the TV world exploring. In these instances the game is essentially a dungeon crawler, with turn based battles. Outside you go by a day by day schedule. During these sequences, yes you buy supplies for your dungeon crawls, but you also cultivate relationships(Social Links as they are called) to help build up power for fusing Personas(Basically making more powerful Personas). There are many side plots from these additional relationships and they range from other students outside of your group, to a studious boy, a nurse, a struggling mother and others.<br /><br />Now about this port, there are two new Social links, a new epilogue, a new dungeon, new scenes, extra time to do social links, new personas, a trivia game, extras showcasing the history of the persona games, and many many many others.<br /><br />Aside from this being a port, there is much what makes this game special. This is a game that unlike the repetitios shooters that have paper thin plots and poor attempts at story telling, this game tells a story rife with themes and emotions. Exepct to encounter themes such as Jungian Psychology, the stress of fame, a commentary on the overinflux of information from the media, the manipulation of media information, Sexuality, Small Town life, the intrusion of corporation on a small community, gender identity, isolation, death, homosexuality, bullying, and many many other themes. This is a deep game with heavy themes to it.<br /><br />This is why I feel Persona 4 Golden is a port of a game that was already amazing. This is one of the finest games ever made for many of the reasons I listed. Not just this port but the whole experience. If you are tired of the mindless hand holding manafactured shooters that get all the attention do some digging and you will find games with heart and depth like this. You will not regret your choice of getting this game.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Raunchy humor, offensive language and an adult man still best friends with his childhood teddy bear makes for an hilarious comedy.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was my surprise of the summer. Someone recommended it, I downloaded it with no expectations. I loved it. Great legal mystery with believable characters. My favorite book of the summer.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works well, easy to understand.  Essential application for my Kindle Fire.<br />x x x x x x x x x

B004P8JPS6|3.0|Good prequel to the Reacher franchise. Can definitely see where he got the thought process to travel the way he does.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great graphics ....wish it was longer and a little more difficult ...an adult version would be awesome.  terrific quick entertainment.  recommend
B00457WZEI|4.0|REally enjoyed this. The book is so much better than the movie. Kept my attention and I enjoyed it. it's different.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game, centuries old.  This is a particularly good game because once loaded on my kindle fire it does not require wireless to play.  So I can play in the car on long trips etc.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|One of the most cleverly written mini series on TV. If you like story book stories paired with twenty first century times then this series is for you. Snow White, Prince Charming, The Evil Queen, Rumplestiltskin, Captain Hook etc. meets in the past and the future worlds. Love this series.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It was the best book ever couldn't take my eyes off my kindle<br />Great for teenagers interested in drama have fun<br /><br />  -A
B00000FZ1V|4.0|Great vintage movie, watching quality was very good, package was sealed and no cosmetic flaws on or inside packaging. Great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never read an entire book before, and I've finished this one in 6 days! I can't wait to start the next one in the series!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is great on my Kindle Fire...love Anne Hathaway's narration. xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xx xxx xxx xxx x
B0036TGSR6|5.0|ROMAN POLANSKI (ROSEMARY'S BABY, CHINATOWN) not only directed this movie, but co-wrote the screen play, as well. POLANSKI, definitely, STILL HAS IT.<br />EVERYTHING about this movie is NEAR PERFECT (and, at times, PERFECTION). The ATMOSPHERE of this film is reminiscent of 1940'S NOIR. The EVOCATIVE SOUNDTRACK is GREAT  and the CASTING is BRILLIANT--EWAN McGREGOR (BRILLIANT in this role), PIRECE BROSNAN, TOM WILKERSON. OLIVIA WILLIAMS. among others. The muted tones in the cinematography add to the mystery and menace in this movie. And of course, THERE IS THE ENDING. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|After the first book they all seemed the same.  I honestly read the books because of all the publicity but did not really enjoy/  Came close to what I imagine porn to be.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This Is actually a pretty good game, drawing fire and burning bunnies is fun lol, maybe in next installment include more player created NPC's. Get this game while its free youll love it.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun little adventure that is simple enough for a non gamer, yet challenging enough to keep me playing! good clean fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My ten year old loves this game! Fast paced and great graphics. Very easy to play could be for a younger child as well.
B001BKAEHW|5.0|All of John Mayer's CDs are good! I really like this one because of the song Your Body is a Wonderland.  He's an awesome guitarist and the music is fun.  Definite CD to add to your collection!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Once done, try to tell someone in any way what you read.  No way. Most complex story line ever . . .wonderful history lesson too.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a very fun story. Easy to read and kept me wanting more.  Nice length as well. Very enjoyable.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I truly hope that they come out with a special edition that includes ALL of the music from this adaptation of the opera, as it is lacking some key musical numbers that tell the story.  The music is brilliant, and the emotion of the moments transcends the operatic undertones. From what I can tell, the critics did not like this film as much as the audiences. This was just the best version ever, both from a musical and theatric perspective, and will be hard to beat for years to come.
B0099G3I96|5.0|Gwen Stefani's vocals are awesome! Music is fun! Been listening to it over and over since I downloaded it.  It's a must need for your collection!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A must read . . . can't be described adequately in any kind of review . . . will never be able to make a movie . . . extremely complex plot.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book.  I was emotionally gutted and then put back together.  It still makes me suck my bottom lip a little just thinking about it.  The characters were real and flawed.  It was impossible not to be completely sucked in and incapable of knowing how it was going to turn out.  Absolutely unequivocally recommend this book, one of the best reads for 2012!
B0058YZ2KG|3.0|...If it fit. I returned this shoe because it was too large. I normally wear a men's 11, sometimes a men's 10.5. i heard this shoe ran large, so I ordered a 10.5. It was much too large, like wearing a couple boats on my feet. The return process was easy, painless, and fast with my seller. You may want to review your sellers return policy to make sure you can fix the problem for cheap. I now have this shoe in a size 10, it is a great shoe.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is her best CD yet! I totally dig the song &#34;22&#34;.  For anyone that loves the fun music of Taylor Swift this is a must!

0061998494|5.0|Do you remember that TLLS episode that Craig laughed out loud Because of something Geoff said about his place in Scotland?<br />Well,this book explains why Craig laughed so hard.<br />Craig's history in the 70'-80' Scotland is Nothing like you would imagine.<br />Let's just say they were no throwing beads in involved at that time.. :)
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Makes shopping easy. Love the app. I love shopping on amazon and this app makes it fast and easy to shop.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. Funny, endearing, tear jerker, and just a real good read. Definitely would recommend this to a friend.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Don't get this app... it is no where near worth $2. I want my money back. The camera was working fine the first couple of days but then it stopped working. The kindle fire hd can already take photos from the device, just not videos. So I was looking for an app to record videos. Bam. I came across this one. Anyway, about the third day, it stopped working. I tried to take a video but there was a box that kept popping up saying, Camera has stopped working. Then it would close and go to my main screen. I did what it said to do when your camera stopped, which was to turn your device off and restart it or whatever. I did it like 5 times! All I wanted was an app that can take a simple video. Not an app that crashes. So don't get this app and waste $2. I also tried<br />re-installing this app like 10 times but got no luck.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was very good and always a quick read as with the whole series. I hope for more insight into Christian's thoughts however.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Every one of the books is better then the last. It is an awesome story line with great stories!! Love it.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Haestorm gets better and better every song is amazing and her voice just rocks.  Highly recommend to anyone who still enjoys good old rock.

B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is so amazingly funny never gets old. I might buy it very soon and have it in my DVD collection.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Can not wait for the last two books so I know how it all ends. I read them all and I've been watching it on hbo while I wait for the last two books to come out
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|This album did not show the style of the old Linkin Park. It had two good songs on the album which where Burn it Down and Lies Greed Misery it was not very well done at all! This will be the last Linkin Park album I buy.
0670023329|5.0|Whilst lamenting the PRK's miserable conditions, the hell described is the very model and endgame sought by Democrats/Labour throughout the West. When the powerful reject individual liberty for the common good, markets cease, and the insatiable leviathan State consumes all, incessantly demanding more until there's nothing left to consume. The rich will always be to blame for failing to pay its fair share, then the State will find and create enemies/\\"extremists.\\" The Left despises the American Constitution because it outlaws the totalitarian power necessary to turn citizens into subjects into slaves. Hooray. No more income inequality, the State provides all, all pay their fair share.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book series was amazing. I loved it. I honestly know this sounds cheesy but I didn't want it to end. I love the way it ended. I can't wait to see the next movie to see how they can make it comes to life.
B007FC3AAI|3.0|I bought it for my wife she loves them. They are ok. Could use some more action since its suppose to be vampires and werewolfs
B00422LESO|5.0|I love this book...<br />.just as much the second time!<br />Shannon Hale is a fantastic author!<br />  Read Midnight in Austenland as well and all her others.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|everyones opinion counts because everyone is awesome. I think Sonic 4 episode ll is amazing. Well that's what I think, what do you think. Say something now. I injoyed it did you? Answer now!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Really fun...not too challenging but still worthwhile.  A nice way to waste a couple hours. More of these please ICOOLgeeks!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love all of the books. Read them all back to back. Can not wait for the final two books. Such good story lines.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Sad to finish the trilogy but thoroughly enjoyed it. The development of the story was fantastically crafted. The only bad part perhaps was the (no spoiler) part with her brother but it only bad compared to the rest of the book's caliber. So all in all better that others book's weak moments. If you have read the other book's you should be satisfied with this ending. However to know that Steig was writing a 4th book before his death makes me wonder what could have come next.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who does not like angry birds. Its a great time killer that is addicting as each chapter gets more involved and intricate in destroying the stealing piggies.
0515142247|4.0|This book feels like a \\"Die Hard\\" movie brought to life on the printed page, with all that is good and bad about that description. Suspenseful, romantic, ironic--all those great features of the Die Hard series--along with a completely absurd and unbelievable plot and set of circumstances--and an even more preposterous set of skills and endurance thresholds on the part of the main hero-character (the appropriately named, Jack Reacher).<br /><br />So, imagine you are reading a \\"Die Hard\\" (or more extreme a \\"Die Trying\\") book. It's exciting--to be sure. But also, a bit repetitive. Every scene presents a new physical challenge, a new description of standards for the weaponry and firearms to which the various warriors have access (this is a little bit of weaponry porn), more geographical detail about where the kidnapping is leading. But all of that, on the printed page rather than the film screen, starts to grow a tad bit wearying. And this is a 426 page book. Die Trying, indeed.<br /><br />And yet, the crisp prose style, the vigorous scene setting: These set Lee Child aside as a budding master of the genre. He's the real thing.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Love the season. Better then the last one. Can not wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
B000F3AB0Q|5.0|If you like the BLUES you cannot help but enjoy GARY MOORE period.one of the BEST.YOU ONLY HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIS MUSIC.YOU CANNOT HELP BUT ENJOY
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I absolutely love Hidden Object Games, and this one was fantastic!  The storyline was excellent - very engaging and the HO scenes were great - challenging enough so that you had to spend a little time looking for some of the objects, but not so hard you had to use a hint all the time.  There is also a really cool option in the HO scenes, where if you don't want to do the HO scene, or having difficulties, you can play an optional card game instead.  I thought this was a great idea, even though I only used it once (on the tutorial), I still thought it was great to have the option.  Yes I did end up getting the full version, and was very happy I did so.  A great game for a great price.  Keep up the good work G5!!  I cant wait to see the sequel of this!!!
B002PJN59M|5.0|I love this movie.  It is an interesting take on the myth of King Arthur.  The costumes and armor are cool.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great books. Every time you think you can not be shocked he throws a curve ball and leaves you speechless and shocked throughout the whole story
B0001BKAEE|5.0|Fantastic! I had to look at it twice to make sure I understood what was happening,but it was the best! And I loooove Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburn.(spelling?).Action,camera work was outstanding.Action,out of this world!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|While the movie was beautifully made and kept my attention, I hated the ending.  It did not make me feel good!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is fun and simple to play! Any time I get a little bored, I pick this game up and play for awhile. I still have not reached the difficult levels yet and I have been playing awhile.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Love the book. It's an easy read and if you like zombie stories this is worth reading different from the usual zombie stories.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson,at his age,is still magnificent! Age is definitely just a number.He has always been one of my favorite actors,great screen-presence.While acting,he seems to be truly experiencing what he portrays in the movie.It seems that he has the art of &#34;placing me right there&#34; where the action is.That is a true art!
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Very funny and moving. The beginning of the family and patient centered health care we know today. I highly reccomend!
B005VPRETE|4.0|My daughter loves this lego set and takes it apart and puts it back together over and over.  This set also lends itself to imaginary play as well as construction.
B003RRY60S|5.0|This is the first Doctor Who book I've read and I enjoyed it immensely! I love the show and I'm sure I'll enjoy more books.
B0000TB014|5.0|Awesome CD for the new or old Michael Jackson fan!!!!<br />Christmas Present for my 13yr old she LOVES it :-)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Finally a book that made me get up early to finish it.  Not that I wanted it to end.  I loved how during their question and answer sessions that they were brutally honest with each other and their answers.  That was refreshing.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter had a great time playing with this and loves that legos are now in girl colors.  Lots of bricks.  Clear directions.  Pictures for other possibilities.  Enough pieces to use your imagination.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|With a cast such as is in this movie what could go wrong, we were enthralled by Judi Dench and Maggie Smith whose characters made the story line flow smoothly, I thoroughly recommend this movie to all who want a good laugh and cry at the same time
B009VB7P6G|5.0|i really liked this movie for my goddaughters, and myself. it's sweet and sentimental about the messages it gives about family and relationships.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love this trilogy it is a great item the last movie was absolutely amazing bane was a crazy villian almos as good as the joker
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Oh my I wish my dog could talk. I loved this book. It written clearly with a warmth the I could feel even through my kindle. I highly recommend it. If was fun and enjoyable
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is pretty good. Sometimes  you get involved  so much that you can lose track of time and don't  want to give up.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Entertaining, funny movie. It was better than I expected and is definitely worth a watch. Good joke, but the end felt a little rushed.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This was a great book, reminiscent of the older books in the series. Some of the other reviewers felt the book was slow or confusing, I thought it flowed well. I read it on my kindle in a day!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It works well on my Kindle and I am very pleased with the performance. Looking forward to playing Bingo Blitz on the Kindle!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't want to ruin anything, but I will say that this book was well worth the money! Enjoy it.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|fun and challenging app! it's worth paying extra for the full version :) I love that there's many different ways to go through the game. I'dlike it more if it had help on line if I get stuck.
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|Billionaire corporate asset manager Eric Packer coolly surveys the death of capitalism as he rides through Manhattan in a stretch limo looking for a good place to get a superfluous haircut.<br /><br />Not having read the book or really knowing what to expect, I watched COSMOPOLIS for the first time last night. There's still a lot I don't get, which is all right because that's the sort of film it is: You don't have to savor every detail, bit of conflict, or other nuance in order to feel like you've been taken somewhere quite unusual, and new things will pop up with each view.<br /><br />The quality of the filming, acting, and everything else ranges from good to impeccable. There are many interesting characters and changes in scenery, and plenty of unexpected and often very amusing stuff happens. Nevertheless, COSMOPOLIS is driven more by ideas (conveyed mostly through dialogue)than plot or character. There are all kinds of multiple themes here: desire/greed, love/sex, creation/destruction, and it often raises the question of whether certain dual concepts that we tend to consider antonymous are actually synonymous extensions of one another. COSMOPOLIS is full of symbols: Without reaching too far, one can interpret the various details in a variety of different ways.<br /><br />A lot's been said about what a strange movie this is, and, well, if you like \\"strange,\\" you'll probably like COSMOPOLIS. The whole flavor of the film could be described as surreal or, perhaps, realistically cartoonish. For some reason, it reminded me a bit of the film adaptations of Vonnegut's novels (SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, HARRISON BERGERON, et al), not to mention BATMAN.<br /><br />Having said all this, I can understand why people who strongly favor realistic, action-oriented drama will probably NOT like COSMOPOLIS. At any rate, the various reviews here should give you a pretty good idea of whether or not you want to see this.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I was really looking forward to this one, I expected a little more and was a little disappointed, I liked the last one better.
B001ECQ4DA|4.0|I had no problem making this product work. This show is super funny and it's one of my favorites. I would recommend this show to anyone who does not intend to watch it with young children as there is some sexual humor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought I would not be able to get through this book. The whole premise behind it is revolting to me. But I wanted to see what the fuss was about so I gave it a try. I did not expect such a wonderful story of courage, love, survival, bravery, and deep caring for others. Can't wait to read the next one!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, John Grisham does a superb job of keeping one guessing.  I have read and enjoyed all of the Grisham mysteries and this one is no exception.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|After years of putting it off, I finally took the plunge and splurged on a pair of Toms. Yes, I know that they are supposedly overpriced because consumers are actually paying for two pairs of shoes. Still, I think it's pretty obvious that they don't cost *that* much to make.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION:<br />There's really not much to these shoes, so if you're looking for lots of support, I'd look elsewhere. The cotton-lined upper is made of pieced canvas. The stitching appears to be fairly sturdy. The outsole is made of a thin rubber layer, so you may feel a few bumps when walking on rough ground. There is a sued insole and a rubber arch support.<br /><br />FIT:<br />These babies run big. I'm a 7.5 to 8 (usually 8), and I ordered a size 7. They were a tad snug out of the box, but they quickly stretched into a perfect fit. I have a high arch, so I was concerned about a tight fit across the top of my foot. I felt a little pressure in that area at first, but it wasn't really bothersome and disappeared as the shoes stretched to fit.<br /><br />COMFORT:<br />Yes, they're comfy. Are they supportive? Not so much. I wouldn't wear these for lots of walking or standing. They're great for knocking around in, but don't expect to feel like you're walking on clouds. They're quite comfortable for what they are.<br /><br />QUALITY:<br />Although I still believe these shoes are overpriced, I have to admit that they appear to be well-made. I expect that they will be around for a long time.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I like my red Toms. They're easy to slip on and will get lots of wear. They're perfect for my casual lifestyle, and the available variety of colors and fabrics provides a great way to express a little individuality. I'll wear them with jeans, shorts, skirts, and casual dresses. I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to collecting more colors.
0307742539|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a very long time. It was just the item I needed to complete my collection of the series.
B003DT19F0|5.0|My Grandaughter loves watching all types of videos and this one was very cute. Nice to see fun childrens videos.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Again, another Grisham novel that I could not put down.  I love the mystery, twists and turns throughout the book.  Those that enjoy the mystery of &#34;who dunnit&#34; will enjoy this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if there were clearer directions,but otherwise I really like it. I end up playing for hours,not realizing how much time has passed!
B001FB4VY4|5.0|I had no problem making this product work. This show is super funny and it's one of my favorites. I would recommend this show to anyone who does not intend to watch it with young children as there is some sexual humor.
B00005NP04|5.0|I Gave it to my husband as a gift since we both love country music and he is a Martina fan.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|My son loved it. Purchased for him for his birthday. He said he can follow with the Alien theme now.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman by Raymond Briggs is a great DVD.  I got one for myself and one for my grandkids.  We love watching it over and over and it crosses over generations.  What a great story.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|This series is going to be ranked as one of the best ever on national TV.  And the fifth season is no exception.
0545128285|5.0|We are all Harry Potter Trilogy fans in this house and my son loves to read. He especially enjoyed this book.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Most realistic racing game I have ever played! Both sound and graphics are excellent, and there are multiple skill levels to play to keep the challenge alive.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Love this movie - always have.  Beautifully written, fabulous story, wonderful actors, great set and filming.  Can't say enough about how much this movie touches me.  It has become my second favorite movie of all time.  I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great story with deep characters.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was initially amazed by this book and recommending to everyone I could. SPOILERS FOLLOW.... like everyone else, I felt so much sympathy for Amy in the first part of the book, and within a chapter I wanted to run her over with a truck. The ending was the most disappointing conclusion of a novel that I have ever read, and after I finished the book I felt almost physically filthy, and wanted to wash all memory of the book from my mind. Save your money, because if you buy this book or even get it from a library, you will feel cheated. Maybe some will like the book as I at first did... but I found that it had so much promise, all of which was killed in the ending's lack of justice.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|I got this app so that I can read old and new emails and go to all my folders on my account. This only lets you read unread ones unless you search for a person but as far as I see you can only do it word for word.
B003V40SGS|1.0|This movie was a few years before my time, but it must have been old and dated even on the day it was released in theaters. It has that campy 1960s live-action Disney quality to it, yet it was released in 1979. Star Wars debuted two years prior, and Alien came out the same year, yet those two films feel like much more modern science fiction films than The Black Hole does.<br /><br />The story is boring and drawn out. Even the action scenes are boring and laughable.  The characters, even the two \\"cute\\" robots, are a challenge to care about. No child would ever willingly watch this film today. And even as an adult, it felt like a complete waste of time. The only redeeming quality I get from watching this is I can finally scratch this movie off my list of movies people have told me to watch. Why they wanted me to watch it, I don't know. Torture, perhaps?
B000002MY3|5.0|I had this disc on a car trip my sister & I took.  After playing it once, she had to have one - so guess what I got her for Christmas?  Every single track in this cd is outstanding - I just love Alanis' clear vision and ability to speak through her music.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never read a more beautifully written book . This story leaves you feeling so many emotions , never have I felt so strong about a book though . The strength of Sky is indescribable I am in awe of her . Then there is Holder and can I just say WOOOOOWWW!!! I honestly can't say anything bad about him he is hot and sweet and understanding and everything a person should be . Just WOW you gave to read this , book don' t hesitate  you won' t regret it .5 STARS........
0684847248|5.0|This book was written almost 20 years ago and its message is timeless. Peck is extremely insightful and straightforward. I have already give several copies to friends!
1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom's 'The Time Keeper' is an enjoyable and gripping read. I highly suggest this humble acheivement for young and old alike. Albom makes his characters very real, modern and sympathetic without detracting from the exposure of their inner struggles. This story will translate very well onto the big screen in the hands of a gifted director who will maintain the integrity of the script without deviating from it's focal theme. It's easy reading and easy to follow along.<br /><br />If we are all under the realm and fate of time, how can we fully enjoy a meaningful life without keeping track? This book may help guide you in that baffling question that flumoxes many of us. The Time Keeper may or may not be a morality tale teaching us how we should live our lives, but it will serve as a powerful lesson to us all.
0307120007|5.0|Bought this for my infant grandson - just as I bought these for his much older siblings.  He's too little to read - but kids are never too little to be read to.  The touch factor makes the book more attractive to little fingers and smiling eyes.  Would recommend to anyone with little ones - pre-readers especially.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is prefect for eliminating outside noises. Could not sleep without it. Neighbor lets her dogs out early and they love to bark. Using white noise, I no longer hear the barking.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was pretty funny, mostly due to Rebel Wilson, who play Fat Amy.  However, I cracked up whenever Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) talked or mumbled. Her dialogue was amazing!  Awesome flick for a girls night at home.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A really good book. You will enjoy curling up with this wonderful story. It makes your dreams come true and more.
B000065M00|5.0|My second copy.  Wore out the first copy of this cd.  I love every track on this disc - brings me back to my youth every time I hear it!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Loved the book, the writing style is unique and superb...would certainly recommend it for anyone...5 stars from me!  Will read again, and again!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|i purchase one for my mother and one for my mother in law. they were both pleased with the cd remarking that michael buble sounded like bing crosby, crooning the seasonal tunes.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it so much so I decided to buy this one as a gift for our friend. So funny!
B00493E1GI|1.0|This movie is simply ghastly.  Julia Roberts still looks good in jeans even at her age, and that's where anything positive about this movie ends.  A film about selfishness, self-indulgence and nothing else.  That might be all right if the movie had any entertainment value, but it is simply deadly dull.  Boring.  RJB.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|They do a fantastic job. I enjoy their music and have several other albums by them. Will buy more as it comes out.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Top choices for me. A classic favorites for all ages.<br />Everyone needs to read this book at some point.<br />Great story!
0425263916|5.0|Can't wait for the next one to come out. Seen a lot of people think its too close to 50 Shades but I still love it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game. I have this game on my ipod and it is so much fun;so when I saw it on my kindle fire I immediately got it.  My point is it is a great game
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I got the free version of this app and finished it quickly. I got the full version when it was the free app of the day. I would've bought it anyways!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This a great book! Got me hooked read it all in 2 days. Hopefully there will be another . A must read.
0425263908|5.0|YAY! Couldn't be happier with this series thus far. Already read the second one and waiting on the third to come out.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game reminds me of scribblenauts with its simple design but complex puzzles. its neat seeing your very own stickman creation coming alive and using all the different magic pencils. I recommend this highly
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I first saw this movie during weight training  of my sophomore year in high school. I've seen it 15+ times since. There was awhile where I would watch about 20 minutes of it before working out and it really motivated me. I know it word for word. Arnold is amazing, and this &#34;documentary&#34; is superb. The Raw Iron extras are also a great treat, with never before seen commentary and interviews. It's a lot of extra footage, but if you're a dedicated fan it's not enough. I recommend this for anyone who is curious about the Golden Age of Bodybuilding, or any weight lifter in general who does it for more than just the sport.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Man this book was awesome. I hope they make a movie cause I will love to see the arena go up on film.
B00136JU7Y|5.0|This remains Ozzy's best album, in my opinion. It's better than Blizzard. It was recorded hastily and it shows. Who cares? It has 5 songs better than &#34;Crazy Train&#34;. The only other album with Randy Rhodes, it still has punch, and still rocks as heavy today as in the 80's. Alll in all, an outstanding album
184195392X|5.0|Great story, well written, and a psychological twist at the end.  I have bought this book several times as gifts for those intellectual, deep thinkers who enjoy reading!
0307341550|5.0|After reading Gone Girl I decided to read Sharp Objects and found it an enthralling read. It is fast paced and not very long so it is (in my opinion) the perfect weekend read!<br />Gillian is sharp witted and just twisted enough.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|The love story is great in this book. I really like the connection between sky and holder but the whole abuse and suicide part is sad and I don't enjoy reading about that.
B009AJD5E0|2.0|Unless your in to the futuristic mindset of what is to come looking to this movie for action like other action movies, you'll be disappointed
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|The movie gives the best treatment of the war between Werewolves (lycans) and Vampires.  It includes a more powerful immortal than ihe parents and maybe more sequels.
1582406723|2.0|My sister mentioned the TV show to me so I started to watch it and I thought I would give the graphic novels a try.  The characters come across as bland; they are more colorful in the show.  I would rate this higher if the lead male character was more likeable.  I kept thinking \\"he's a bit of an airhead, what a dimwit\\".  He often had a dopey expression on his face.  Is it wrong that I liked the zombies more than the living?  The story was simple enough and I liked the grotesque illustrations enough.  I must admit the ending was abrupt and odd; it made little sense to me.  I thought it was dumb.  It could've been improved with a possible ending that had a tad of closure yet still open-ended for the story to-be-continued.  For example the last picture could be one of them leaving the campsite.
B00846REIS|5.0|Literally the awesomest Best book I have ever read. I'm never going to get this book out of my head!
B006VZS1EA|5.0|By the end my wife and I were on the edge of our seats cheering to, this is a very good movie
B0072OFM28|3.0|I was not able to watch the segments on TV because of non-availability.  I did purchase Vengence to continue watching the story.  I did like what I saw and will probably purchase the final offering.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I used to have an iPhone and loved playing PVZ. When I got it for my android I was disappointed with how out of date it was. It's been over a year with no update or any sign of a future update. Don't waste your money until they update it.
B002Y0TGOU|1.0|I have plenty of bandwidth, ran a speed-test, and tried out other services, but I couldn't get this to come in any format better than line-doubled SD.<br /><br />I'm sure it was some sort of glitch in the pipeline, as I've seen other Amazon video come in as HD. I doubt it is anything specific to this movie.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob......I really liked this book noting that a mother will do anything to protect her family from harm, even from themselves, from within the family unit.  I was surprised at the ending, but thinking back on it, she may have saved many others from a terrible ending and a life choice only one can't  imagine making when your child is envolved within such troubles.  What heartache she must have felt to do such a profoundly terrible thing in the end. My heart went out to those parents and all the others involved.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Noomi Rapace is an exciting actress and launches a new Alien franchise.  We hopefully  can expect two more sequels.<br />Naturally, I will purchase the DVDs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game bit needs improvements like caves animals lava and more demensionss or improve the nether and armour and a new enemy like a 6headed dragon but besides that AWESOME GAME
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a must read. Very well written and the story keeps engaged from start to finish. Totally worth the money.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|yes, thank you for the cable and for your prompt help.  I am up and reading as usual, again and again i do like my KINDLE read very much.  I wish the story title would appear on top of each page and to also have a page number instead of % signs. I think it would make it most helpful at times. thank you again.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|A riveting TV series that continues to intrigue and mesmerize its viewers. A raw and brutal depiction of life and the ripple effects one's decisions can have on people around you.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|Up until a few months ago, I had never heard of this group. I really like his two hit singles &#34;Some Nights&#34; and his previous hit &#34;We are Young&#34;. By the way, I really love their video (you can find it on YouTube) and how it relates to a Civil War theme. They only have two CDs so far but I am hopeful for more.
B008OHV5C8|4.0|Really like this band and see them every year when they pass through town.<br />Two members originate from these parts and one from a state over.<br />The compositions are getting a bit more &#34;out there&#34; on this outing.<br />Glad they ditched the singer on this one.<br />Would recommend to any Bad Plus fan.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It is a short but inspirational read. I enjoyed it very much. It's a good page turner that makes you appreciate what you are as soon as you finish.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've never read a Clancy book before this one. I've always enjoyed the movies, but with my new Kindle app on my new tablet I received for Christmas, I ordered the novel. I have a military past with the US Navy in the Silent Service. This book kept me engaged from start to end. The technical accuracy in this book impressive, as are all of the movies I've seen. The story was frightening because it is absolutely how the next war will likely be fought. I'm not much of a reader, but seriously, I could NOT put this book down. I've since downloaded two other Clancy novels and look forward to them, as well. You might also like to check out Brad Meltzer. His books are also full of action and mystery with conspiracy theories.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I hace all of Susan's CD's and enjoy listening to then regularly this one is just as wonderful as the others
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Lotsa stars, yet was able to pull it off. Am interested in the other Marvel movies, especially Thor and Captain America
B009E3EXMU|5.0|There are so many reasons for any music fan to get this.  Many have written reviews, but you'll have to watch it yourself because each time you watch it (yes you'll watch it more than once) you'll be able to focus on some new element and will be amazed each time.  Page is flawless. Jones is as solid as ever and it's nice to watch him smile and have fun. Plant knows his vocal limitations, but truly does an amazing job.  And, if you are a Zeppelin fan you can't help but get goose bumps watching Jason live out his dream of playing with Led Zeppelin....the greatest rock band ever ever!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Having a blast playing with my daughter just hope we don't have to spend real money like others have said. Friend us! Boomerski
B0098460O4|5.0|I love this this CD it is just wonderful. I'm waiting for their next CD. For someone so young Jonathan has an amasing voice
B00005RIKI|4.0|The DVD was okay but there is something about the sound quality that is not right. It sounds a little off
034580404X|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition; just like new.  Got a education regarding subject of books, but I read them in 3 days.  Very good.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great free basic digital alarm with a couple extras! Like the display and you can change a few key things.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies of the year! Utterly believable! Not much action and a very straight forward story line but the acting, especially on Matt Damon's part, and the great production make this a special movie. More like watching a documentary than a Hollywood blockbuster. So if that's you're thing, you will love this movie as much as I did.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Doesn't work! Even at a novelty it's a waste if time and memory. Don't do it! You.ll thank me later!
0385535139|4.0|I like this book, but then I like all of John Grisham's books.  It arrived in good condition, but did have some dirty pages in it, being a used book it was in good condition, but not like new condition.  I also had a concern that the book was stamped &#34;Columbus Metropolitan Library&#34;.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Saw Rod in concert in Denver when he was going through his red/orange hair phase and it just didn't seem right.  This is the Rod Stewart I wanted to see live and I will be watching this concert many times.  Very enjoyable for any fan!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was unable to put this book down.  I was so glad I did not have to work this weekend because this book and I had some late nights together.  I thoroughly loved it from beginning to end.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Just adding my love to the chorus here: Zep killed it with this final concert. The guys clearly rehearsed and they all sound great.  Sure, Plant doesn't hit ALL of the high notes, but he hits most of them, and all of them when the count.  Jimmy plays loose and awesome, just like Jimmy should, so it doesn't sound like some rigid cover band playing the songs rote from the records.  JPJ holds it all together, and Bonzo Jr. just kills it (in fact, it might make you tear up a bit).  My only quibble: on a few of the quieter songs, you can hear a very faint but present high pitch noise coming from Plant's vocal mike. I know that it's a strict live album with no overdubs or fancy studio wizardry to doctor it up -- and partially that's what makes this collection so awesome.  But they had to know they were recording this, so I would have expected them to work out those kinks before the concert.  Nonetheless, it's an incredible concert by the greatest rock band in history, so I very highly recommend it.
B000002LND|5.0|Love it all the songs on it that I loveand the price was right for me thank youfor helping me fin d what i like.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I loved the Bee Gees from the first song I heard and was fortunate to see them live in Denver in 1979.  Unfortunately, the guys were only about 3 inches tall from where I sat.  Watching this gave me the feel of being in the front row and the delight of being up close and personal.  I couldn't ask for more in a live concert recording.  This will be the most cherished DVD I will ever own.  RIP Maurice, Robin and Andy.  Health, healing and long life prayers for Barry, last man standing from these music legends.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I listen to his CD all the time.  I have it in my car.  I like that he is trying to bring back the old songs.<br />Barb L
B003ORZ83K|5.0|A fabulous love story that lets you escape the present world and put yourself in another time where life was quite different.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well written.  Kept me engaged & entertained the entire time.  I could not wait to figure out what happened to the wife.  Surprising twists & turns throughout.  I am looking forward to reading another book by this author.  The only reason I didn't give it 5/5stars is because I was slightly disappointed with the ending.
B004HX4RT6|2.0|just to easy game to play... simple and simple ..<br />but some are not simple.<br /><br />not to much of excidment.
0545265355|5.0|My Daughter-In-Law wanted the Hunger Games book for Christmas.  I bought it for her at one store, went to another store and saw there was a Trilogy box set, so I bought it there.  I went to the original store where I got the first book and found they had the Trilogy box set also, but cheaper.  Well for the heck of it, I checked it out on Amazon.com and found it even cheaper yet!  Plus it was eligible for the Super Saver Shipping.<br />Then my Daughter-In-Law was really surprised to know it was a trilogy, too.  So we are all really happy about it.  Thanks Amazon!<br />Barb L.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was interesting reading about his NDE and his wonderful physical recovery. I'am ending now.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|Danny Kaye is a hit in any movie he made. This one is a classic and great entertainment. It is a great comedy with enough intrigue to keep you wondering what will happen next and the &#34;ta-pocketa&#34; will stay with you for years to come. Enjoy, it is hard to find these on DVD and they are worth the money.
B008M87GJK|3.0|up loading is slow and information is good.<br />sometimes just load all the editing story<br /><br />just too slow or maybe my connection.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I WAS TAKEN AWAY INTO THIS WORLD AND LOVED THIS TRILOGY.  ITS REALLY BITTERSWEET AT MOMENTS BUT WILL STAY IN MY MIND FOREVER.  THANK YOU.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|really love this game. very addictive and fun. has great levels and will challenge the best of gamers. would recommend to all of my friends.  give this game 4.5
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is hard to put down,the jealous but love of the characters are over the top.enjoy this book today
0316287059|5.0|I already had this book, but I purchased it for a friend as a birthday gift.  She loved it too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|IT IS JUST AWESOMENESS CANT WAIT TILL FEB!!!  NOTHING LIKE ANY ZOMBIE MOVIE/SHOW EVER!!! I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS SHOW TO ANYONE (18+ OF COURSE)
B0063IH60K|2.0|I have similar progarm on Ipad and I phone which  works much better than this app for the Kindle Fire.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is the first of the crossfire novelsI read after read Fifty Shades of Grey I think this series beats it hands down. Im sad I have to wait for may for the next book grrr!
0316286850|5.0|I already had this book, but I purchased it for a friend as a birthday gift.  She loved it too.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|It started a little slow, but once it got going I just couldn't put it down! After the first 20 pages or so, the book really picked up and it was a great read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Hilarious! Much more entertaining than free cell or solitaire. It now is the game of choice for this 60 year old lady
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This book was odd in someways but it was a very good read it had me interested the whole time
B0063IH60K|3.0|The ads that pop up between games are annoying! I would of gave this app 5 stars if it wasn't for the ads.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|You would have never seen all these lead actors together like this in their prime. Nice way to go out.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Has a great story and witty humor. Might be a little intense for younger children but a good movie for all ages
B0063IH60K|5.0|I chose this game towork on hand and eye cordination.  Great to help keep you &#34;on your toes &#34; if your an older person!
030758836X|1.0|I am so sorry I wasted my money on this book. The characters are totally unbelievable and the plot is a joke-a sad joke- on anyone who spent money on this book. This is the first review I have ever written, but feel I should warn anyone else who would be swayed by the high star rating. I read it on my kindle, and kept checking the percentage of content because I was so anxious to get it over with.
B00632HWOG|5.0|this product makes it very simple for me to check my email on my kindle HD which is an easy way to go.  I like my kindle , alot.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't know what I was in for when I chose this book. The title seemed vaguely familiar but I had no idea what it was about. Obviously transported into the future but not overtly sci-fi. I was quickly drawn to the main characters, the protagonists and the intrigues of the game. It didn't take long to become hooked. I would recommend this book to anyone who like me enjoys a swashbuckling historical novel or sci-fi that isn't centered on androids populating the universe.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game was interesting, I loved the way almost every thing was customizable. I liked how it presented itself as a unique game and premiered as such. If you like (or liked) Scribblenauts or Drawn to Life you should get this game. You will find plenty of similarities between them, yet a couple differences that make this game so different. It is worth your time and of you get it this New Year's Eve, it's free. :D So spend a kilobyte or two and download this game. You're welcome, have a nice day.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this app is MUCH better than the facebook app that was pre-loaded on my kindle fire.  the only thing I would add is the ability to edit your own comments.  other than that, it's great.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I really can't rate it because I can't get into it.  Since 9 more words are required, it doesn't work for me.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very addicting, but wish it would reload coins faster. I play this on and off through out the day and also before I go to bed
B000FQIRXQ|4.0|If you know a bit about Dicken's biography, this movie will appeal to you. I couldn't help but think about how parts of it paralleled his life and how he depicted his experiences. It makes it feel more human.<br /><br />Dicken's was the father of soap opera. He had a talent for telling several different stories, weaving them in and out of each other, but not showing you the big reveal of how they all fit until the very end. He's masterful at that. Unfortunately, David Copperfield is not one of those types of stories. I think it feels less interesting than some of the others for that reason (hence the 4 stars).<br /><br />The cast is STELLAR. They all do a fabulous job of becoming their characters, but the characters- like most of Dicken's characters- are pretty one dimensional. There is always a \\"good one\\" who has the action happen to him rather than acting on the world. (That's David Copperfield in this movie). There is always a \\"bad one\\" who gets it in the end. This is predictable in that way, but you still can't help but be carried away with it and love the story. Or at least that is how it played out with me. I loved the way that different strata of society were all shown that would not have normally interacted with each other. I think it makes it so much richer than just dealing with one slice of life.<br /><br />Great cast. Great costuming. Great story. Watch it.
B009O07NDY|5.0|The music for this movie is absolutely amazing with hints of the Lord of the Rings music peppered throughout. I enjoy listening to this in the background while I do artwork and it's lovely.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was very good loved the graphics and the story . I will love this game to have sequel !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So glad that the book ended the way it did. It's exactly what I needed. Can't believe I read all three in four days.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book. It was a book club selection and not a book I would have picked.  I found the book really intriguing and enjoyed the mix of history and mystery.  I thought Kate Morton did a great job making me feel for all the characters and had a hard time putting it down.
B006WJ0332|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because No matter how many times I try it, I can't get episode 7 to work right. For this rest of it I'm very happy about this purchase.
B000001FO4|5.0|Yes this item meet my expectations. I enjoy ordering from your company because you have a lot of my music from my younger years. They can be hard to find at other places.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I don`t understand how even the richest game companys don`t have the graphics than Gameloft?Another great Gameloft game that blew my charts...Kindoms &amp; Lords!
B000021Y7X|5.0|Saw this in the theater when it came out back in the 80s-- just watched it last night and it seems as fresh as it was back then. A must see for all fans of David Byrne and the Talking Heads!!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Well acted - story line challenges you - pay attention - loved the first two - this one adds to the history - early 'K' is perfect for the part!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book wasn't\\"t good........It was GREAT!! !!I have already read the second one and it<br />was good but this one was better.
0307592731|1.0|I'm still reading this, but so far all I can think about the author is that she is an utter moron, with the morals, sense, and scruples of a beast.<br /><br />Yes, we all have our problems, and we all need to grow up at some point, but there is something about this woman's character that no amount of hiking around can fix.<br /><br />The way she lumped getting an abortion with buying supplies and otherwise getting ready for her trip made me almost physically ill.<br /><br />And her decision to hike, as a young woman, all alone on this trail just showed her utter lack of common sense.<br /><br />She is a complete self-absorbed little idiot, and I cannot make myself feel anything but revulsion for her.
B009HELT3C|4.0|This is a good sequel/prequel?  to the first two movies but not quite as clever in some ways. But still a solid enjoyable if<br />M.
B006O6F932|5.0|Product was just as it was described, my daughter loves playing with it and packs it up to take it wherever she goes!
B005HSL626|4.0|This app is really cool it is fun to see how many you can slice and try to beat your record this is one of my favorite apps and it is very fun
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and they thoroughly enjoyed it. I, however, not being a big fan, did not really see the appeal of this, but it was a nice gift.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|In this game you can collect coins by playing the mini games. you can buy games with the coins you earn. I give this a 5 star game!!!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game. it is so awesome. very creative game.  very fun game.  no game can beat this game

B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play. Loved  the graphics. not complicated as other games. At the end of the game it is exciting to see the decks dance.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I can't tell you how long I've looked for a calender I can create simple notes in the form of simple text paragraphs and easy check lists....so long! This is the best!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Good movie yo sit back, relax and laugh to. Some parts I was laugjing out loud...I don't understand all the puke though.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|leadership<br />teamwork<br />ingenuity<br />communication<br />determination<br />imagination.<br />this guy and all the characters have it all<br />a blessing to little ones the world round !
B002BSHWUU|4.0|The only problem I had was with the packaging: for an estimated 200 bucks I was a little put off that there were no CD sleeves. For half the money, RUSH put little plastic sleeves in their Box-Set of CDs and I was quite impressed. I so hate the cardboard slide-out package that I always end up creating my own plastic jewel-case to protect my investment. It was RUSH that brought the CD sleeve to my attention. So now I will go to Sleeve City and buy some CD sleeves and update my collection. But really, $200 and no CD sleeves? Bummer.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I enjoyed seasons much more than this one, but it is something new to play at times. Easier than some others and more relaxing.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Being a mechanic by trade, it is nice to have a simple multi tool on my belt for quick fixes when I am at work.<br />The blades lock securely, it is comfortable to hold and use.
0446554995|5.0|never disappointed in these two.<br />always a showstopper<br />get the whole series and find a comfey couch and a cup of tea and this is good quality me time<br />come away with more than you started.<br />enriching.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|Really like Nicolas Cage good actor really like ghost rider, gone in 60 seconds, Next, Con-Air was a great movie.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|It's a greatest Hits album. Need I say more? You don't have to be a big GnR fan to appreciate this album. However if you grew up in the 80s/90s you certianly heard them. This album includes the best of several albums and as the name would indicate, it includes all the hits. For someone like me who has misplaced, had little brothers permanantly &#34;borrow&#34; my old GnR CDs, this is a great all in one album for the GnR hits that I liked. A must for GnR fans or people who dug a few of their songs. With Amazon Cloud Player, having the ability to download or play in the cloud from multiple devices is a plus. Another reason why I purchase most of music from Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so fun especially when there's nothing else to do! I really enjoy challenging myself to beet the games and win more points.
0394721780|5.0|2/3 of recipes are more than what i'm used to, but have enjoyed the ones i've tried and want to perfect them..<br />also has side dishes i have not tried yet.  have asked my grocer to look into mutton and goat and other bits of meat listed..<br />cow brains, tongue... ?  i'd at least like to try before balking.<br />expanding culinary skills has always been a goal since hubby travels and eats out around the globe then comes home to spagetti :)  . will keep trying stuff.. our store just got chili jelly in and mint jelly and red or green pepper jelly.. have to figure out what to do with those.. sound interesting.<br />have expanded my herb knowledge... this has helped.  recommend highly.  even if you only get a few recipes from this, i would highly recommend it...
B001NAT05W|5.0|It was a great movie.  Halle Berry is a great actress and really like her movies.  Hope she makes more soon.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Awesome Game!!! Super fun and exciting on some parts but can also be hard at some parts.I also like that you can be what you want instead of the game choosing. for you.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Simple yet works really well on kindle fire, I love how you can change the color of the light on screen. So yes get this app, cuz compared to the other ones that you can pick this one works!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|not a fan of HBO, generally, but this one is a keeper. nice job.<br />attention to detail, good plot, thought thru, extremely well delivered and excellent story telling.. only on the third book so far.<br />looking forward to season 2.  we don't get tv anymore after years of friday nights with nothing good on... so money goes to movies like this one.<br />yea!!
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love the show and I love the DVD set. The package arrived super-quickly. This is a gret way to purchase DVDs.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|only problems I had were trying to d/l and install, then its a demo not a full game. was kind of upset that I tried for several days to install a game i could only play for not quite an hour. otherwise game ran very smoothly. did get some &quot;buy now&quot; screens but nothing horrible.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|love it We enjoy Streisand and this CD is what we expected of her and the colaberation with the other artists.
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|A story of  survival that gripped me from beginning to end. Unsparingly honest, as well as inspiring. I'll be watching the documentary next!
B009GED3HS|5.0|This has gone on too long.  Who cares anymore.  I wish the kids had never been born.  Please end this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book that appeals to all ages! Definitely should read!!! Adults and preteens and teens.....something for everyone!!!!! Read read read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can't really mess up Solitaire, the cards are large enough for you to see, and it works like it should.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Very good. Classic Michael Connelly.  Enjoyable read and a good extension of the character.  Enjoyed the read over a couple of days these holidays.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Really I must have been drunk when I ordered this.  I never even watched it.  I do like sugar cookies however.
1609611543|5.0|I was suffering symptoms of Celiac disease for years, and four different doctors could not determine what was causing my symptoms.  A friend told me about this book, and it changed my life.  The stories in this book are more frightening than any horror novel.  I had no idea what this &#34;super wheat&#34; was doing to people.  It motivated me to try going gluten-free, and the results were astonishing!  I highly recommend this book.  I am so much healthier and, within 3 weeks, I lost all of my unsightly belly bulge.  Everybody comments on how much healthier I look, and I really feel healthier, too.  If you think you may have a wheat allergy, don't even hesitate to read this book.  It is life changing!
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|For a family like ours where three languages are spoken at home and a fourth in the community, this book has been the best Christmas gift. It is not only pleasant to read but also full of practical ideas. What I find great about the book is also that it touches the cultural aspects of bilingualism. It is a must-read for families raising or having plans to raise bilingual kids.
030758836X|1.0|I will say this: Gillian Flynn is a fantastic writer.  Gone Girl kept me reading to the very end, where I was left hanging with my mouth wide open.  This is it?  Are you kidding me?  This is the end of a story I spent the last couple weeks making time for?  The ending was absolutely horrible and so disappointing! The writing was superb.  The story kept me reading.  But, the ending ruined it for me and I will not read another of her books because of this ending.  Sorry Gillian!  You need to write better endings for such awesome stories!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Stupid  stupid stupid.  I think it was stupid.  And then it got more stupid.  And then it ended stupid.  Awesome.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really love this app ot helps me with any work I need help with and I really enjoy using it.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Great acting, but even these heavy weights had a tough time moving this plodding script along. Made me feel uncomfortable to watch at certain moments.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Nice variety in this puzzle and item search game.  Environments are detailed and add to the spooky ambience.  Even the story is interesting. The game is surprisingly long too with bonus content.  Very well executed and entertaining game!
B008OB1QFK|5.0|Chris Knight does not disappoint fans on this newest release! His true to life lyrics rock you to the core.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I rented this movie because it was based on a true story.  It was done well, but was extremely violent!
034580404X|5.0|Bought for the 'hype', kept reading because I enjoyed it. The first book isn't my favorite , but the 2nd and 3rd better than make up for it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter which she really enjoyed. It occupied a few of her vacation hours nicely.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Amy Adams & Justin Timberlake gave really solid performances in this. Clint just has to show up to be great.  John Goodman was loveable as always.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Love doing crafts and do it your self projects.  I haven't done much on this site because it is a little hard to navigate.  If you click on a project you end up on other sites and sometimes travel to two or three before getting to the how to of the project.  Often the how to is not very clear.  The sites sometimes are a sales tool rather than helping with the project.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Ken Follett's books are wonderful but I found Winter of the World wordy.  Pillars of the Earth, World without End and Fall of the Giants were masterpieces.  Hard to put down.  The book dragged until the last quarter which is something that has never happened before with Mr. Follet's writings. I know I will read his next book because I have to read the full trilogy but I hope that it will hold my attention at that time.  He is a master in his profession so I expect something more worthy of him.
B008Z9L8QI|4.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband, who is a big Billy Corgan/Pumpkins fan. This is a beautifully packaged box set with all sorts of interesting extras, including a decoupage kit. My husband was thrilled to receive it, mostly for the 3 discs' worth of previously unreleased tracks.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|This movie provides a good background for the Alien movies. Nice story, good graphics. It is not about the Aliens, but about how the came to be.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|came on time and in okay condition, was what I ordered and I am somewhat satisfied with the product, parrt of the case was chipped thanks
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|this game was interesting and simple to begin. then it was hard to put down. really enjoy it so far.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is am analytical game. It is fun like doing word.puzzles.  It is the forms of water and moving it where you want it to go._
B00992CF6W|5.0|I haven't played this game but I love anything minecraft.(I have Pc version) my brother got it for his ipod touch (I prefer Amazon's products) and. it looked really cool. Knockoffs of minecraft make me mad.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this. I watched this musical on youtube and fell in love. I love the vocals and the upbeat parts. I would recommend this to anybody who love musicals and broadway.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone, and they absolutely loved it. I also listened to it, and thought it was terrific.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I was looking for this,record and.luckily found it at Amazon at the perfect time. Bob Marley st the best. Love it.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|This is a great toy for kids. It challenges them to follow instructions or design their own builds. Excellent product and most of all fun for all ages.
B000RW7536|5.0|I had already gotten the movie, so I wanted the cd to go with :) This is a great cd featuring songs that were barely or not even in the movie. I love the fun energetic songs that make me want to dance :)
B00004XPPB|5.0|Come on .... see this movie. It is everything you think it will be. The story, the writing, the direction, and of course the acting - superb. But .... VIOLENT.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|The half-hazard story line of this movie is by far the worse yet for this series.  I really wanted to like it, but it seems like the writers decided they didn't have to put any effort into it since they were reviving chunks of the cast from the first two movies and filmed it in 3D.  It's quite clear they were setting this up for a sequel, but at this point I'm pretty sure I'm not going to bother.  I would recommend saving your money regardless of how cheap this movie gets.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This was the perfect gift for spending time with the grand children. It's a great way for kids to gain experience building per instructions, and use their imagination to build their own creations. I highly recommend this!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|i bought the book on a whim and i could not put it down. great story telling plot and characters. i would recommend it to any fantasy fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose a five star rating because I really liked this book. I thought that it had a great plot/storyline. The main character's point of view was very insightful.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi is a brilliantly written book. The first part of the novel deals, I think with to much religious material which seems to be unconnected to the rest of the book. But the second section of the book is amazing in the authors ability to sustain tension in a compelling way for so many chapters. Pi's ingenuity, courage and intelligence are a reflection of the author's command of his suject matter. After the first section, the book is impossible to put down, so give it a chance and you will be rewarded.
B000000WF9|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to finally buy this soundtrack - it's awesome if you are a fan of instrumental movie pieces. Michael's Nyman's work here is second to none and this is already one of my favorite cds to relax with or listen while working.
0762434279|4.0|I have always liked Robert Kiyosaki's approach to financial well-being.  I suspect his presentation rings true for most folks; now if only they would follow his advice!  This compact edition makes a good stocking stuffer for a teenager or young adult.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Fall of Giants has a good story line, good WW1 history review, but the writing is not Follett's best.  A little disjointed.
B004G8QTS4|3.0|Great escape reading. You can see the evolution of Winslow's style culminating in his best book, &#34;Savages&#34; which I recommend highly. Winslow's hero is a compelling and likeable character and you're rooting for him all the way. You're going to learn a hell of a lot about surfing too. Dive in!
1423140605|5.0|Great series for kids above 9yrs old.Third book of series.  Our son loved the previous series by this author.  Get it.
B005HEELJ0|5.0|I skip the mindmeld scene that starts around 35 minutes. If you've never seen the whole episode, it may be necessary to endure it, though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a wonderful read. It was hard to put down because you couldn't wait to read the next chapter. I can not wait to read book two.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Chevy Chase is hysterical!  I'm not sure if its because he reminds me of my father or because I'm Jealous that I can't have a Christmas like this to look back and laugh at.  The scene after the squirrel runs out the door and the old generation tries to leave is my favorite!
1423140591|5.0|second book in the series.  9 yr old son loves these series.  Hard cover books.  Good price for three books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read! Sucks you completely in! I was captivated by the characters and their twisted minds.<br /><br />But the ending...why. weird.
B005COO1X6|5.0|This is CLASSIC Stephen King. If you have enjoyed Stephen Kings short stories this one is for you. The only bad thing I have to say is I always want more...
B005LAII12|4.0|I saw this in the theater & had to have it on DVD. It has a lot of funny moments and the story line is very sweet, but after watching it once I'm not dying to see it again.  I'm sure I'll watch it again, but not one of those movies where I try to memorize the one liners to use in my future....
142311339X|5.0|Our 9 yr old son loves this book series.  Would recommend for kids above 9 yrs old.  Good price and delivery was ontime.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|Mumford and sons is a refreshing break from all the disengenuous, manufactured music that has become the norm for our modern day, spoon fed society.  Acoustic instrumentation, passionate delivery, and tangible lyrics, afford the listener an easy connection to the music.  Mumford and Sons' sound is an organic blend of old world, celtic rhythms married with sophistocated acoustic progressions and empathetic humanistic themes, delivered by highly competent musicians.  This cd is a must have for the serious, eclectic music enthusiast.  Highly recommended!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|it is definitely  one of the better games out there and worth the money. hard enough thats its not easy but not so hard that its frustrating.  plenty of hints that give just enough help but not to much.
0887306667|5.0|I'm not from the marketing area, still, I enjoyed the book and feel like it provided a good basic knowledge in such an amorphous territory...<br /><br />I definitely recommend it!
B008J34466|5.0|Pink is at her best again. I can't wait to get off of work everyday just to listen some more. This is an absolute must for Pink fans!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've played this game on an ipod before so I knew what the game was like. I was excited when I found out they know had it for kindle. This is such an addictive fun game.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is fun to pass time it has all the original gameplay from the website Ninja Kiwi with a little added things like the research lab and the helicopter monkey tower.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I really enjoyed this book there wasn't a boring moment in it. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Though I am a hardcore Tarja fan, Dark Passion Play still did not disappoint me.  This album is great from start to finish, with plenty of representations of Thomas' creativity and unique composition skills.  Symphonic Metal is an amazing genre of music, and Nightwish has led the way in such a musical styling.  You won't be disappointed.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Easy to follow - great story - real situaion...<br />Would recommend for all,<br />enjoyable - refreshing -<br />Clint Eastwood is a natural!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I downloaded this for my daughter after she kept begging to play it on my phone. She likes it, but what would be really great is if I could get JUST the ball mini game as that's all she really wants to play. (she's 2)
075669812X|5.0|Great product! Got it for my son for Christmas and he loved it! The character my itself is being sold for much more expensive than this book plus figure.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very addicting puzzle game, worth every penny. Fun to keep re drawing figures and changing names. Highly recommend to everyone.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Not a bad game but would be better with the ability to travel through the map.  Got stuck in the manager office trying to get puzzle piece and no helpful hints
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Just started using, but easy, intuitive and functional on first uses.<br />One of the first apps we chose for the KF
B0063GORYU|5.0|fast as you want to be. goes well. works good. its just like all other spiders. hasn't froze up on me either.
1933308087|5.0|This book has every conceivable quilt block that you can possibly imagine.  I have plans to make a quilt later this year and use some of these blocks as a &#34;sampler&#34; quilt.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I had a blast reading this.  I really enjoyed the humor and the science.  I feel like a learned a lot of new information about mars as well as enjoyed one heck of a harrowing adventure.  I definitely recommend this book!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I am not a big gamer and without instructions this was not a kid easy app. It does have pretty graphics. Took off the kindle
B00005LK94|5.0|A GREAT film - one you can watch over & over again and NOT get tired of seeing! Destined to become another &#34;timeless classic&#34;, I think. GREAT story line and great acting!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. Although, I received it from her, also.  It arrived in very good condition and very quickly!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book a real cliff hanger... I think it is the best book in the series and we love to read it again......
075669812X|5.0|He loves reading about the characters and what they do, He brings the book with him to almost everywhere he goes. And the mini figure is a super bonus
B004ZN9UZO|4.0|This is definitely one of those CDs you don't skip around to various tracks. Like a lot of Pink Floyd albums (& a lot of Classic Rock albums), it was made for listening from beginning to end. The recording industry doesn't work that way anymore, & it's a cryin' shame!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good graphics. typical story line. lots of back and forth. but that seems to be the new normal.<br />trial was free. I was involved enough to pay for the upgrade.
0930289234|5.0|if you haven't read this yet you should.  the awards speak for themselves.  this is on essential reading shelves for any new americana assignments.  closest thing we have to a modern myth in our society.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app on Pc and it is even better on my kindle fire!!!!! oh yeah.....get this NEWER version of bloons td for $2.99 instead of bloons td 4 for $3.00!!!!! SAVE SOME MONEY!!!! hahahaha
B004T340QY|5.0|in a word: wonderful. this movie is a gem. if you watch, you will not regret it. quotable from start to finish, this movie will keep you laughing far after the credit finish rolling.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I bought this for my husband & he and my daughter had lots of fun putting it together.  Very Cool!!!
1401201911|5.0|one of the best constructed stories i have ever read.  comic book geek thru and thru, but this is all around great prose.  the ending = *mindsplode*
B000056HOZ|5.0|I don't have a Bruce Springsteen I do not recommend.  This one meets all my expectations for a Springsteen program.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|everytime fb updates, i assume that it will be better, but it is not. save storage space and just use your browser.
0896898288|5.0|I first saw this book when a fellow quilter bought it.  I am<br />fairly new to quilting but I just loved all the different blocks<br />in it and bought one myself.  I hope to get started this<br />year and make the quilt.  I
B002BWP49C|5.0|I watched the movie with my daughter and bought this for her.  It was very entertaining.  I know why this movie series was a hit.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|The book was well organized and complete in its explanations. I've studied body language for years and found some differing viewpoints, especially on posture and the position of the hands, but the author writes logically from a position of experience. The book promises exactly what it delivers.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|i bought this cd so that i could listen to one song, but i ended up loving the whole cd. every song is a good one. if you purchase this, you won't be disappointed.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The 100-Year-Old Man is a refreshingly absurd review of 20th century history as seen through the eyes of an ironically unambitious man who leads a Forrest Gump-style life. This story provides entertaining relief from our currently complicated and often distressing modern reality. Worthwhile reading without a doubt.
B005HSL626|5.0|really really really really cool I am a master of fruit ninja and I cant stop playing it and I am so glad its free and it doesn't freeze up so its totally worthy of 5 stars
B008UFUOH6|4.0|My mom loves Christmas music, and she has just about every recording of the old standards available. I heard an interview with Tracey Thorn on NPR and decided to give this album to Mom to add to her collection. Thorn chose a more eclectic mix of songs than the typical Christmas standards (no Baby, It's Cold Outside or The Little Drummer Boy here!). Her cover of Hard Candy Christmas is excellent. I'd recommend this CD to anyone looking for a change from the typical Christmas music drone we have from Thanksgiving to New Year.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It came on time and usually I dont get anything on time. It works great and was definatly worth it.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Title says it all, this app is great for the first couple minutes. After that it gets old quickly. A great way to waste a few minutes.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|I have only played it for a minute or so and so I can't properly critique it but so far it's a nice game.<br /><br />Will update after I get time to play it more.
B0046M4H70|5.0|This movie takes you on an historical journey from an androgynous perspective.<br />It was absolutely captivating in how this journey was enacted.  Tilda Swinton is otherworldly in how she develops this character.  As a spectator you identify with the main character 'Orlando' as she morphs from male to female and anything inbetween and yet your still not quite sure.  This made me feel uncomfortable in an insightful way.  Just as you get comfortable with her persona and the era, it changes.  I have watched this movie at least 20 times and each time I notice that everything about the story means something if you are truely listening and observing. No time for daydreaming or nodding off.  If you are interested in what it is to be a male, a female and variants of these, how this is expressed or suppressed through sexuality, dress, mannerisms, social expectations, this movie will intrigue you.  Even make you question your own ideas of yourself and societal expectations.  A wonderful experience for reflecting on your way of being in the world.<br />'Orlando' could be used as a tool for opening discussions with any person or group who is questioning or wondering about thoughts and feelings they have had about feeling different and find out it may be perfectly normal to have these thoughts and ideas.  A movie to expand the mind.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been playing Spider Solitaire for years. I was thrilled find it for my Kindle Fire. This is a great way to pass the time.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app can be useful for downloading YouTube videos, but it can also be rather picky about whether it is going to work.
B007STBUHI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The movie purchased is great. It's a classic, and worth the purchase. Great
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I read this book in a few hours, I could not put it down.  Loved it. Can't wait to read more like it
0345528581|5.0|Nice to have a gym in your head no matter where you are and you view your environment as your own gym.  no excuses and functional exercises.  the only think lacking is a warmup idea or structured one.  other than that it's perfect.  The forums are great to get support and ideas on marklauren.com and contribute to others.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|a pleasant addition to other the angry bird games. I especially like the new physics. It will keep me busy for quite a while
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Love the game itself but instead of starting where you left off, you have to go back to the beginning.  Would prefer to get back to the level I left.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This has good puzzles that keep the game moving forward and the player thinking about all the pieces and how they fit together.
6304711905|5.0|What's not to like!?  It's a classic!<br />I just love the scene where Doc Holiday shows that<br />outlaw what he's working with!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Its just a poorly constructed game. Tough to navigate, tough to play, and ugly if I dare say so. Sad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a fun game, and it makes the time go by faster.  This version is pretty cool.  The pop up commercials are not too annoying as they come up after a game has finished.  What do you expect for free!  Typical solitaire game, lots of fun...as challenging as any other solitaire game.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Doiwnton Abbey is an extraordinarily excellent portrayal of life and drama among and between the &#34;upstairs&#34; people and the &#34;downstairs&#34; people in service to the mansion  and its' owners. Covering the period from 1912 through World War One and into the roaring twenties this show is incredibly authentic in every way. The costumes are fabulous. The acting is superb (Maggie Smith is outstanding but so is each and every one of the men and women involved in this production). The characters are totally believeable and the interwoven plot lines<br />are fascinating and engaging. The dialog is delightfully British (as is the high toned delivery... which makes closed captions extra valuable). Our only critical comment would be that some of the dialog is not the way it would have been in 1914 (phases such as &#34;sucking up&#34; being used )  but overall it is truly a five star production.
B006YB9VJU|4.0|They are great. material is nice and well packed. I really dont use them as much as I had planned/expected. But great product!
B004GYOQ6A|2.0|the tilt controls don't work very well. Tilt controls are something that few games work well with and this is not one of the games that they work for.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I am a huge Sci Fi and comic fan (which- for a woman- means I expect a certain level of entertainment in my movies)but The Dark Knight just didn't do it for me. The lighting in the movie was so dark I often had trouble seeing what was going on, which pretty much defeats the purpose.  Also, Tom Hardy's Bane needed subtitles much of the movie, which made watching a chore instead of entertaining.  The only reason I have it two stars instead of one was for the redeeming ending, which was a welcome twist.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is great!  The story is creepy and fun and the graphics rock! I like how many puzzles there are too.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this is an ok game. its kinda slow to play. I really didn't know what I was getting when I downloaded the app.
B008458O3S|3.0|This little game will make your noggin work for a while. I started playing this game and couldn't stop for quite a while. Only 3 stars because it starts to feel like you do the same thing over and over.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Thirteen reasons....<br /><br />A box full of tapes delivered to his door. But why?<br /><br />Clay is one of the many people to come to receive this box full of tapes. To hear the story of thirteen people who played a role in Hannah's life. But what could Clay have done to end up under such a category; of the girl that he liked? In under one day, Clay listens to Hannah's story, starting with her first kiss.<br /><br />All that are on the list; whether friends or enemies are there to listen to her story as to why they are a part of her decision that had been made from nearly the beginning.<br /><br />This story.... It was haunting, in a way. That the voice of a girl who is already dead is actually telling all of these people that she has planned her suicide.<br /><br />I thought that it would be a weepy, sort of sad story that was absolutely depressing- since thinking about the word suicide, that is what pops into our minds. But the story went deeper, sort of telling us about Hannah, and even made the reader care about her. Her personality is amazing.<br /><br />Though the main person who is narrating is Clay, the attention is mostly directed on Hannah, because her voice is the one who is spoken the most. The story didn't dwell too much on Hannah. Her life with her family and such. Only with her friends. The story begins with Justin, a boy who gave her her first kiss, and from there, the story built up well.<br /><br />Asher really made you feel rage, or sadness with scenes from the story. He gave just the right amount of imagery, and details; not too much.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I liked the ending of the story, only because.....well, I can't explain that to you. It would ruin your experience with the whole book. Also, it took me a while to figure out Cay's age. Asher did not describe Clay well, it seemed that he only gave me a name.<br /><br />Read it. I'm sure others have said the same too.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As a mother of four, I rarely find the opportunity to read. I have managed to read both book one and two in less than three days downloading book three right NOW. Thank you Suzanne Collins!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|It's a classic. What else can you say? My favorite part is Scrooge going to the window on Christmas morning. The Bible speaks of &#34;new mercies&#34; every morning. What a changed perspective from the day before as he threw open that window.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|There might be many games, but they are all silly little games that are difficult to play. You have to unlock most games by earning points. Play the same game over and over in order earn points, just to unlock another useless game. Repeat...the same thing over and over.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I got this game because I like Mahjong games plus I want my mind to stay working and not loose memory.<br />I like Mahjong but would like to have more games on it but understand why and I could get the full version instead.<br />I would recommend Mahjong to anyone that likes to play.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughter, we loved it. The music was great, and she immediately wanted to watch it again. It was really easy to order it on instant video on our ps3
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it<br />Wow best one yet. I will read it over again and always love it<br />Keep it up<br /><br />The end
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|The movie was the best my wife and I have seen for awhile,money well spent and would recommend to anyone
0913866156|5.0|I received my cards in perfect condition, brand new. And the shipping was fast and packaged perfectly. I have not gotten to learn them yet, as I am working on the Waite cards first in my training.<br />THANK YOU!!:)
B00AAX68HG|4.0|It's an awesome game! But, sometimes the pudding doesn't move when you try to move it. But, you should still get it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Crime fighting, office politics and personal relationships makes for a good read. Once I got started I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the first chapter, Hopeless had me hooked. There are so many twists and turns that you can't put this book down, you have to know everything - right now! Just when you think you've got it figured out, the story takes another turn and you're right there along for the ride.  It's hard to put into words the emotions the characters of this book go through because this is one of the most emotional books I've read.  This book is so well written that you feel everything the characters feel, you live the story.  Colleen Hoover is an amazing writer and she has once again given us an amazing story with characters we care about and we root for. Holder is the main male character in this story, and all I can say is that if all our sons were as kind, considerate, caring, and responsible as this character we would all be so proud!<br />Thank you Colleen Hoover for another amazing story that captured our hearts.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|One of the Christmas classics that you can watch in the original black and white or colorized (both included in the &#34;special edition)
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Heard Mark on Howard Stern I`m a fan of both sounded good so I rented it WELL WORTH IT!!<br />highly recommend :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This novel had more twists and turns than the road to Baguio. Grisham goes out of his way to ensure that the reader cant predict the outcome. Pleasantly surprised.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is fun and when I am bored I can play it whenever! I always play it when I have nothing to do.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Our household loves this game.  My son won't put it down and has powered through most of the levels.  It has become a part of family game night.
B002C6A6N6|1.0|Very disappointed. Love the series. The DVD sound is not in since with actors lips. I sent first set back and replaced them but the second set is defective too. I'm bummed. Returning second set.
B001CEE1YE|3.0|I bought this as a present for an inlaw per his request.  It appeared to be well received by him.
B006E2W24U|4.0|Bought the upload now video and the quality was decent for being an online video. I would definately do it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Looking past all the physical this series is a beautiful love story, leaving me wanting more! Hope to read more in the future, if there is any more!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app was wonderful as we were traveling during the holidays. It was nice to know the weather at each location.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Vary fun and hard to put down. My kids love making the stick men and moving them around. 5his is a game you will go back and play again cuz it is so silly.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|tugs at your heart for both of them.  a real life type movie.  worth watching for men and women.  buy it
B008N1V11U|4.0|Gameloft once again pushes the limits of the Kindle Fire :D. But, good graphics come at a price. The space it takes up in your Kindle is catastrophic and the app crashes once in a while. Nonetheless, worth the money and I was so happy to grab this app for only a buck.
B007HWTQQ8|5.0|The movie is very vivid and emotional. I don't like to watch violence, but I think in this case it shows exactly what our Savior went through so that we can have salvation. It adds meaning to it. It's very difficult to watch because of how awful they were to Him, but it depicts the love of God for us, thus strengthening our love for Him. He made that ultimate sacrifice for us, so now it's our turn to make our sacrifices for Him, even unto death.
B001PPMJHQ|5.0|What can you say? Gerard Butler is so hot! Very funny English sarcasm and good story line. I would rate this 100!
0525953728|5.0|When I heard about this book, I was very interested in reading it.  I personally have know a few SEALs and had the pleasure of training among the elite.  Me being a Ranger medic.  When I finished reading the book and while reading it; this book does explain everything it is like in a war time environment and training what said person must overcome and how even screw-ups happen, in which, one must adapt to said environment in order to succeed.    I am very thankful on how Mark Owen told his story of a SEAL and what it was like being in on the mission that Killed Osama Bin Ladan.  Any solider of any military would appreciate how truthful Mark's story is told through this book!!!  Even down to the jokes and pranks, which is very true!!!  With me been in the military and knowing some of the pranks we pull on each other, his book shows this quite well, but do not forget even down to the s*** talking that's all fun and games, but deep down every solider who joins the military does it for his own reasons, but really he wants to defend his own country.  American that is!!!
0316212377|3.0|Iain Banks is a fascinating, inventive and visionary writer. Like most writers who reach a certain stage, they write what they like and it all gets published. Unfortunately, especially with the publishing industry being in its currently declining state, less attention is given to the actual business of editing books than there should be. This is one that has slipped through to the press without a decent revision by a competent editor. Too much of the story is just pointless, meandering waffle that does nothing to drive the narrative of the story. While much of it might be interesting in an intellectual and background way, little of it deserves to be in the book.<br /><br />What is there is one of Bank's better stories, with a great plot device, as an impossibly old man is hunted across real and imagined space within the culture and in Gzilt's more hostile territory. All the usual Banks details are here, from the ship-names to the cantankerous minds. The level of artistry brought to futuristic, high-level combat is very well handled. The conflicts between the characters are less effective and on too many occasions we are left listening to two people who have no real conflict ramble on for far too long. There is a lot of fun to be had here, but also far too much is superfluous, repetitive and just plain boring.<br /><br />This will be enjoyed by completionists, but should be avoided by non-fans looking for a good read. For that, there's Player of Games, or the excellent Surface Detail.
B005WQ39CI|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite Robert Deniro roles.  Scary for some, thrilling for others... Great dialogue.  Sarcasm, intensity, and very well acted by everyone in it.
B00169N0BK|2.0|I really want to love this product, but am having problems. I have an iMac and HP Photosmart 7510. My monitor profiled wonderfully, but my printer not so much. My printer was printing images on photo paper way too dark. My wife and I recently bought a Canon T4i and really wanted to get nice photos, so like good Americans, I threw money at the problem by buying this. It has fixed the darkness problem, but now everything I print is way too yellow. I have been working with XRite customer service for a week now (service is slow because of the holidays). I might change my review if things get fixed.
080214473X|5.0|I personally think Mark did a great job on this book, telling it like how a real world story of war should be told!!!  I have meet men that were there on that day and talked to them personally, but I think Mark again did a great job; telling all the facts and explaining what it is like during such a tragic time, when the initial mission was only supposed to be 30-40 minutes, in addition, Mark was able to truly tell the stories of the men lost that day and the ones that survived, explaining every detail of what it is like!!<br /><br />Great Book! I highly recommend it!!!
B00542USJW|5.0|What can I say - a classic movie in blu-ray format.  Always enjoyable. I need seven more words to submit this review.  There did it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|crafting needs to be fixed before I would ever buy minecraft is way better but j was looking for a free alterniative gotta keep looking
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|If you like cut the rope or other puzzle type games you are gonna love this game! I'm not sure what the regular version looks like, but the HD version looks great!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This movie has its moments when it is exciting and when it is funny. It isn't as good as the other two movies in the series, though. Still, it's better than a lot of movies out there. If you liked the MIB 1 and 2, watch this one too.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Loved watching it on my new Kindle.  Really  loved catching up on the series.  Played perfectly well  and very clearly
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I kept hearing people talk about how great this book was, so I finally had to read it. That was a great decision. This book literally touched my heart and made me realize a lot of things. I would definitely recommend this book to someone else in a heartbeat!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Order came in 5 days early. There was no damage to the CD and it was very inexpensive. Over all it was a VERY good purchase
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Anyone who lives in a country with socialized medicine, (Canada, UK, France, etc), should watch this movie to see what real people go through in the USA. Medical care may not be perfect in your country but you may think better of it when you see what some unfortunate people have gone through in this movie. Made up of stories from real people, this movie makes you think.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is fun. it takes time to download but it is worth it even though it might set you back to the beginning sometimes.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. It kept me interested from the start. Had me crying and smiling all through it. Loved the ending.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Love this series because of its hilarious, sharp, realistic scripts, and because of its amazing cast.  The 3rd season is as good as the previous 2, and I can't wait to buy season 4.
0316017930|5.0|This book really makes you think. The author identifies patterns in normal people which are obvious once you read it here. You can actually use the information for a little self improvement although the book is not a self help reference.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I came into this movie with some trepidation. I'd read tepid reviews and did not expect much. I'm a fan of Paul Veerhoven's take on the classic Philip K. Dick story, (I Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\". I'm also a major PH Dick fan. The first thing I noticed is that the setting puts the film's story in the same world, essentially, as \\"Blade Runner\\", and could have been happening in the same city at the same time. This really sets the tone, which is quite a bit more involving than the campier 80s version. Kate Beckinsale's character has a lot more to do in this rendition that Sharon Stone did in the same role. I watched it again right after I saw it, just to make sure that my opinion was correct; It is. Forget being reverently, slavishly faithful to the Arnold flick; If you are a fan of sci-fi, Philip K Dick or smart action thrillers, this one's gonna knock your socks off.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's one of the best games I have on my kindle. I really, really like it. It is my favorite games on the kindle.
B005I735XE|5.0|Our Son loves this item! If a &#34; GAGA &#34; fan this is a must have, they will enjoy it!
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|This is a classic that is well worth watching by anyone. Those with an interest in science will be especially entertained. Very good performances coupled with some great scenery and spectacular machinery.
0515142247|3.0|The Jack Reacher series hits a minor Sophomore slump with this 2nd book in the series.  The narrative becomes somewhat disjointed with too much switching back and forth between other characters - I estimate that around 35% of the book is told from the perspective of other characters.  Still, if you're a fan all the trademarks are here - swift and brutal action and nuggets of backstory to help fill in the persona of Reacher.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Flavors of Entanglement is easily Alanis' best album since Jagged Little Pill. Alanis is experiencing heartbreak as she did ten years ago, but this time around she isn't as 'mad' as back then, now she sounds more mature and introspective. Sonically, the album is the aggressive pop/rock that identifies her but with Guy Sigsworth producing it, there is an influence of electronic sounds to several of the tracks. However, there is also an effort that needs to be put while listening to the record since sometimes it is a little challenging understand what she says but that's just a minor hiccup in an otherwise great album. For some strange reason, Alanis popularity has declined over the years but Flavors is yet another proof of Alanis' talents, skills as a musician, and powerful/smart songwriting.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|My heart was racing throughout the entire book. It is fantastic, thrill seeking and wonderful. There were parts where i was in tears and parts where I was speechless.
0143118757|4.0|This book is very helpful for those who would like to become better negotiators. Understanding how deals are made is presented. This is more useful than other art of deal books. There are lots of good points in this book.
0007447868|4.0|After all the epic, back-stabbery of the previous volume, 'Feast for Crows' takes a while to get going as the initial chapters start off from the perspective of new characters and locales but once this one picks up steam it offers everything that one would expect from this series - particularly the final fifth of the book.  And yes, while most of the complaints of this volume are valid I found the extra attention to detail and minutiae a somewhat nice change of pace and appreciated the added layers of world building that fleshes out this world in ways that appeal to the most OCD of lore-hounds.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|The Magic Charger system works quite well, and I'm happy not using disposable batteries. Its even better than using regular rechargeable AA batteries. The one issue I have with this product is that the battery pack does not sit within the mouse well. Its slightly bulkier than the standard assembly, and made of plastic (for obvious reasons), so the bottom of the Mobee battery pack curves out just enough to sit slightly below the mouse feet. Thus, the mouse will glide not on its feet, but on the battery pack. I bought two of these - one from here, another from elsewhere. Mobee would only replace the one purchased elsewhere; they had me take photos of the battery and clip, bend things, remove and reinsert, before they sent replacement. The same issue exists in the new one too. Now I own 3 battery packs that have the silver paint worn off, and getting worse. On the plus side - It's saving my mouse feet from wear.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book touched my heart. I have an old man in my neighborhood who reminds me of Scrooge,but he hates Halloween. Anyway,this book was great. Enough said.
0071771263|5.0|Excellent practice for the toefl test, it is really useful. all the excercises are great and usel to develop skills
1906735875|3.0|This book is meant for the Judge Dredd purist as it collects Dredd's earliest appearances in books such as '2000 A.D.'  These early snippets are still a bit rough around the edges in art/writing so if this is your first introduction to 'Judge Dredd' you may want to start with later volumes.  There is a lot of content and story hear as the book numbers over 300 pages with most stories spanning 6 pages.  Paper quality is very cheap, however and all pages are in B&W.
B005OJTVMK|5.0|I knew that the kindle would need protecting and liked the looks of this item.  I wouldn't be without it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is a great collection of smaller stories telling an overall worldwide tale. I really enjoyed that this book told the stories from other parts of the world in a very realistic way for a very fantastical problem.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|super fun and really easy to use I want part to today and amazon it's great for giving this game for free
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Lots of action....Baldacci keeps it moving and I did not stop until the end.  Ready for the next  one!  Highly recommend.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I absolutely loved it!  Neil is truly an amazing writer.  I am going to buy another book by him right this very moment!!!!!  Thank you for writing and making the world a better place with  this beautiful tale.
0763644765|4.0|Life is changing now when I take the three kids to the book store; even the one and a half year old wanders around and wants to pick her own books. This was the first book she chose to read. This book was a great read for her and for the older two. They remembered their training time. The story is a fun read and well written. The illustrations are fun and the bright vibrant pallet will appeal to the young readers. But only time will tell if it will help, but either way an entertaining book the family will read many times over.
B000ID1IYG|3.0|This is a really bad movie, but my daughter loves it for some reason.<br />Johnny Depp is OK in the movie, I guess.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read most of this book with a huge smile on my face,  I laughed, swooned, & awed a lot.  It's a very touching story that I will never forget.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Didn't understand what the opening sequence had to do with anything but the rest was fun to watch.  Doesn't reference the Alien movies until the very end so It definitely is it's own seperate story from the Alien series.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book. I think everyone can relate to awkward times in high school and how people deal with it
B0059XTU1S|5.0|I was thrilled and a bit nervous to see The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey.  Would the movie follow the book?  Would it be entertaining and worthwhile while staying true to what Tolkien created?  For me, the answer to all these questions was yes. While the order of events was altered somewhat and many new scenes were added to turn The Hobbit into a trilogy, the changes only made characters deeper, the plot more exciting, and the story more full.  Plenty of action, laughs, and stunning scope make this movie a winner.  More importantly, it keeps the Tolkien spirit alive and is very inspiring. For fans of the book and others who have never read it, The Hobbit will be entertainment at its best.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book had potential but was very predictable.  It was a good story and definitely kept my attention but I didn't like the ending.  She is just a spoiled brat and he is just plain stupid.  Huge let down...wish I had not invested any time in this book.
B00846TTDG|5.0|The perfect combination of action and adventure with an actual storyline. One of the few movies my husband and I both enjoyed.
1439127700|5.0|I listened to the audiobook. Not my normal area of interest but I found this absolutely fascinating. They focus on the subject at hand and didn't take you off on boring, well-know biographical side tracts, and kept it moving along. If you have the time read, or better, listen to this book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Worth the time - definitely download and give it a shot. Words words words words<br />Words words words words words words words
B005WMADYE|4.0|Redline is a fun roller coaster ride.  It doesn't have a deep plot or well-developed backgrounds for the characters, but it does have vulgarity, humor, and adrenaline-pumping animation.  It's a good time.  As a heads up, there's a scene where a female character is lounging in her apartment topless, but I don't think there is any other nudity.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I love all the MIB movies, and this is no exception. MIB 3 has less action Amsterdam more story than the other two- but a great watch.

1401923127|4.0|I have been on a personal quest for understanding about how cells function and the role of emotion in healthy cells. This book expanded my understanding and I came away with a deeper knowledge (as a layperson) about cellular biology and the roll of emotions. I really liked the new way I think about the body as a community if cells and each one like a little individual person. Very helpful ideas he expressed. Wish he had looked at application of these ideas and wrote more about the current research to back these findings up.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|Waking Up Married was a quick and enjoyable read.  The premise is something that I can totally see happening in our contemporary world as it is today.  Megan wakes up after a crazy night in Vegas to be married to a man that she doesn't know.  Yet, instead of getting divorce, Connor wants to make this marriage work even though they know very little about each other.  It's not what Megan expects though, he simply wants a partnership, he needs someone to fulfill that woman spot in his life.  This turns out to be more than he thought it would be.  The relationship warps and the true characters begin to show though as well as their true feeling.  As always there is a twist in the story.<br /><br />While the characters are not as believable as I would have liked, in a story of this length, I should have expected this.  Despite this they are both likable and the story flows well.  It is a quick, fun and simple read, perfect for a rainy afternoon.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Since I have been a seeker after Truth, even across the 'boundaries' of religious walls and traditions I like the opening.  And since I have been a sailor, at sea, in small boats crossing oceans and have experienced shipwreck in my youth, I can picture<br />the Life of Pi.  I have yet to finish the book, but will.  And I look forward to seeing the movie.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|By the description of this movie and some peoples reviews I thought this would be one movie I would enjoy. Well I really did not like it at all. It was not very funny and was putting me to sleep.<br /><br />I even watched it a second time a few days later to be sure that perhaps my mood that day ruined it for me. But I found it to be the same bore as the first time I watched it.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Certainly not near Rowling's capability . Portrays the British in a very bad light  . I hope it is not too factual .
034580404X|1.0|The ONLY reason this book is still in the top 100 is because of the media hype...this is the worst written book I have ever read.  Yes I know people..I have heard...\\"You have to finish the series...it's really a great story\\"...blah blah blah<br />Bottom line, if you are a lover of great literature..don't read this.

B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Great job by Pitt and cast. Put a nice human touch on a story that is just as timely today as when the book was written. Interesting that Beane was just named MLB exec of the year in 2012. The simplicity of a game a child can play combined with counting distributions and computer models. There's just enough of the later to make a point, but not enough to be boring. If you are nerdy enough, you can recognize things like the binomial distribution in his notes. The daughter character keeps it light. The good-old-boy antagonists keep Beane a simpathetic character. In the end, we learn its about the beauty of the game at many different levels.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|I am out of the \\"young adult\\" reading group, but this book appeared to be interesting. Though it was well written and fully immersed me, the reader, into Charlie's every thought, emotion, triumph and loss, I don't feel as though things were wrapped up as neatly as other books that I would typically read. Perhaps I missed it,but who was Charlie sending the letters to? What was his major crisis? I am sure that context clues were insinuating the answers, but in a recreational reading, I feel it should be more clear. However, I felt that this book was a very good and powerful read.  I would recommend this particular book to almost any person who enjoys reading.
146500632X|5.0|My 15yr. old daughter loved it!  Was shipped in a box where there was no chance the calendar would get torn, ripped or bent.  I was very pleased!
0446573027|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit that I only read one book in 2012 and did so in less than 2 days. Normally I read 6-10 books a year. If you have never read any of Baldcci's books, you will be amazed how he builds his characters. The author is very detailed in what he is writing about, so like in this adventure, the reader will get a firm grasp on what surface mining is about, plus all other things that tie in with the the investigation, even down to the neighbors on the street. I would say more, but I'm being careful not to reveal  any spoilers.<br /><br /> I had started reading the action  novel early Sunday morning and because of the holidays, I was able to finish it early Monday morning.  A quote by  Thomas Helm summed up my feelings about  the Novel I just read. Helm said  \\"My test of a good novel is dreading to begin the last chapter\\".  David Baldacci's  \\"Zero Day\\" certainly doesn't disappoint and has you guessing all the way.  Just when you think you finally figured things out, the story takes a whole new turn.<br /><br />John Puller the crack army investigator is one of the Author Baldacci's new book characters. The decorated combat veteran is assigned the task to investigate a gruesome crime scene in rural West Virginia, because of the ties to the  Pentagon. Puller  assignment is unusual in nature, because he is the lone Army investigator. John Puller the soldier is determined to find the killer and his investigation is starting to reveal more than just 4 gruesome murders. The murder investigation will take him on a lot of unexpected twists and wondering who to trust. The ending will certainly surprise any reader.  I would certainly have to give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Zero Day met my own test of a good read. That is a book you can't put down until the wee hours of the morning, even when you know you have to get up early the next day. The 436 pages took me on one amazing \\"who do you think done it\\" trip. It certainly didn't end the way I expected it to. I would say more,but once again, I want to be careful not to spoil it for you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing!!!!!<br />By far one of the best books that I have ever read!<br />I felt like I was part of it... couldn't put it down.
1589795474|5.0|This book provides some great perspective on what makes the wealthy tick and the incorrect perceptions that most Americans have.  The author does a good job of not using the book to pass judgment on the book's subjects or the reader, yet does make a strong case to adjust one's own behavior if wealth is a priority.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I really enjoyed the 1st season and could not wait until the 2nd came out.  This season is just as good
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Everyone needs to by their child the Horton Hears a Who movie. I love Jim Carrey but this movie may be for older children not my grandsons age who is 26 months old. Jim Carrey looks too weird in this movie as well as the Grinch. I prefer the old fashion movies. However, the price was too good to pass up and who knows, my grandson when ready to focus on the  TV for more than 10 minutes may love it.

B006WT2TZC|5.0|I just downloaded this album (not here) late last night and played it today, minutes ago.  Let me say, if you like the Scorps in any way, you owe it to yourself to treat yourself to this awesome music on here, comeblack.<br /><br />The first part, seven originals re-done with the latest line-up of SCORPS, is stellar.  No, don't try to think about how it compares with the early line-up, with Herman and Francis because these tracks re-done are simply good on their own.  It is like listening to a refreshed version.  I don't at all think it has to be either one or the other, this music will stand on it's own as fresh and exciting enough that you can listen to either version as you choose.<br /><br />Now the remakes are solid with a SCORPS rocking vibe.  I enjoyed every single song on this album, the originals the most of course, but the covers had a really kickin' vibe to them and Klaus sings so remarkably, the playing, as well, is excellent and is hard-rocking, all the way.  Now, about the true cover songs.  I've never heard most of these songs before, so it was basically new to me.  I think they did a great job performing these tracks in the studio and they sound very good to me.<br /><br />I dig the sound from this album.  Some have said that it seems over-produced.  I disagree.  I like when artists take the time to not only make good music, but to make it sound as good as possible, too.  They've done that here.<br /><br />Once again, if you at all like the SCORPS, then pick this album / mp3 up.  I got the mp3 version elsewhere and am very thankful and glad that I enjoyed my first listen to this album so very much.  Thank You SCORPS.<br /><br />Finally, I hope they release a part 2, because I'd love to hear some other SCORPS 'Classics' re-done in the same way these were, greatly!

B007THA4FI|5.0|Although I have never read any books by Rowling, I decided to try this anyway. The story has many different characters and kept me going back again and again to find out more about them.  Rowling is excellent at making these characters so real to me that I felt as if I was actually in their heads.  I found this book very entertaining and am looking forward to reading more of this author's work in the future.

B0059XTU1S|2.0|S P O I L E R  W A R N I N G !!!<br /><br />Peter Jackson's LotR trilogy blew me away. His Hobbit severely disappointed me.<br /><br />The book is charming and whimsical. The movie is hectic, loud, full of unnecessary action scenes and creatures that either reminded me of other movies (for example, Jabba the Hut made an appearance, complete with cackling sidekick creature, in the form of the goblin king; or the white orc who looked like a cross between the creator-dude in Prometheus and the coughing skeletor-like general in one of the Star Wars prequels; or the trolls, which looked like bigger versions of Kreacher in Harry Potter) or that we had already seen in LotR (for example Gandalf calling the eagles by means of a moth).<br /><br />If you're like my brother and feel that the sense of traveling with the characters got lost in LotR - it is much, much worse in The Hobbit: One second Bilbo catches up with the dwarves, the next they're running away from wargs, the next they're in Rivendell... More time is spent on an idiotic underground battle with goblins (a sequence that looks like a combination of the Mines of Moria and the CGI-swoop through Saruman's forge in LotR) than on the journey from Hobbiton to Rivendell.<br /><br />Speaking of journey: In the book, the dwarves leave Bag End in a mess and Bilbo spends a good while cleaning and washing up and having a leisurely breakfast, glad that they're gone, and then Gandalf shows up and shoos him out the door. This scene is completely missing in the movie, so people unfamiliar with the book cannot possibly understand why Bilbo decides to follow Thorin & Co.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the character of Radagast and the subplot involving him. CGI slapstick! Other major eye-roll-inducing moments include the dying hedgehog, the sequence when the goblin king gets killed (\\"Oh, well, that'll do it.\\") and way too many scenes in which the characters would have been killed or at least injured, yet they get up and walk away without a scratch. Way too cartoonish.<br /><br />The riddle scene with Gollum (the most convincing CGI creature in the whole movie and - with the exception of Gandalf - the most accomplished and convincing actor) was fairly well done, albeit unnecessarily \\"humorized\\" (\\"I wasn't talking to you, was I?\\").<br /><br />Overall the movie overloads Bilbo's tale with too much background story in its attempt to connect it to LotR. It seems quite obvious to me that Jackson and his crew consider this their last visit to Middle Earth, so they're packing as much into it as they possibly can - and then some.<br /><br />To sum it up: This is not The Hobbit, it's The Hollywobbit.ay without a scratch.

B004M9ZI0M|4.0|\\"The Tempest\\" is a well-acted version of Shakespeare's play and gets a lot of benefit from the varied land- and sea-scapes of Lanai and the Big Island of Hawaii.  The actors deliver their lines in as close to a natural rhythm as works well, avoiding the sing-song of lesser productions or the whooping over-playing of some well-known actors.  Helen Mirren as Prospera and Ben Whishaw as Ariel were especially good.  The cliffs, lava formations, crashing waves, dense forests, wind actions, and colorful empty, rocky lands all add to the realization of Shakespeare's vision.  It is an enjoyable way to see \\"The Tempest\\" displayed.<br /><br />The play was originally intended to let the audience while away a four-hour afternoon in the theater.  Cutting it down to 110 minutes involves some choices on how much of each plot strand to add to the mix.  The result seemed all right to me.<br /><br />The decision to have Shakespeare's Prospero played by a woman, becoming Prospera, might have appealed to Shakespeare himself.  After all, there was some recent history for him to draw from.  When Henry VIII's son, King Edward VI, died in 1553, the deal was that his replacement was to be Lady Jane Grey.  A political coup resulted in Henry VIII's daughter becoming Queen Mary I, with Lady Jane Grey losing her head.  Although Queen Mary I pushed hard to restore Roman Catholicism, she was succeeded by Queen Elizabeth I who had a long, popular reign, keeping her father's Anglican faith as the state religion.  It is easy to map these three queens into an acceptable-for-Shakespeare-at-the-time Prospera, who was deposed as Duchess of Milan, who reacted against changes by pushing black magic too far, and who then lapsed back into power as her natural, regal currently-unwed self.<br /><br />This version of \\"The Tempest\\" is well worth watching.

B007VTVGAQ|4.0|Fiona Apple does not easily fit into the music world pigeonholes. Her songs are modern-day tone poems, a mix of music and poetry that weaves a theme together in a way that is not rock, or pop, or even the all-encompassing &#34;alternative&#34; label. Which doesn't explain her penchant for titles.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This book series was recommended by a friend but after reading it I am still not sure if I will buy another.<br /><br />For one the books seemed overpriced at around 10 dollars for the kindle edition.  I've paid much less for much better books.  It is possible the author has an inflated opinion of the worth of his books now that there is a movie about one of them.<br /><br />Secondly the writing style is strangely juvenile.  The author writes in choppy sentences and often seems to refuse to use compound sentences when they would be appropriate.  At first it reminded me of a paper my 7th grader would write so It was disconcerting in some ways.<br /><br />Thirdly, the character is fairly good but sometimes his ability to find things or people using his vast military police experience is a bit strange or overdone.  As a former MP myself I can tell you that not much training goes into being an MP in any branch of the service.  The author makes MP work sound like it was special forces or something, which it was definitely not.<br /><br />Had to give it three stars because I finished the book and if the prices come down I might buy another just for a mindless read.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Like much of Adele's work, her \\"Skyfall\\" theme is a composed of wispy tendrils of thoughts and emotions that gradually coalesce into a portrait of a time, or a memory, or a place. As the theme song is presented during the opening credits, it is both revealing and ambiguous, a masterful effort of tone, music, and words that hints, invites and draws you in. Perfect.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I've tracked Batman for quite a few years - in comics, cartoons, serialized television and in movies.  It's fair to say that I'm a fan, And against that backdrop, I'd say that I find particular incarnation of Batman as something of a disappointment.<br /><br />Batman is a different kind of superhero.  He's the caped crusader, whose abilities rest not in super powers but on cunning and intellect. Sure, he has some gadgets.  But he's not Superman.  He's a real human being whose biggest advantage is his brain.  In the same way that James Bond is supposed to be cool, Batman is supposed to be stealthy and smart.<br /><br />Without Heath Ledger to add excitement to the script, I find Christian Bale kind of dull.  He tries to be mysterious and cool but can't quite pull it off.  For instance, there is that absurd guttural voice he uses, like some kind of scary Muppet.  And then there is the fact, if I'm honest, that Christian Bale just doesn't strike me as a particularly smart Batman.  You almost cringe watching him.<br /><br />And it's not just Bale.  It's the way the whole movie is cast.  Bane is supposed to be the heavy in the movie but the character is confused.  They give him this British accent, to make him sophisticated, and he spouts off a lot of philosophic stuff.  But they've got him dressed like Master Blaster from Beyond Thunderdome with a face mask that looks like it came straight out of Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />My advice is to skip this one.  And based on Bale's performance, expect a new Batman.  Soon.<br /><br /><Update>  Looks like my prediction has turned out to be correct.  Looks like they're going with a new Batman.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|'m just going to write the same review and attach it to all of Brandon Sanderson's books that I have read.  I have been reading science fiction fantasy novels for about 30 years.  I enjoy the genre but lets face it, most books follow &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; in character and style when it comes to magic stuff cause how can you not when it's the pinnacle.<br /><br />Anyway I digress.  Sanderson is the first author to come along that completely broke the mold.  I was totally floored by his books and have bought basically everything else he has written.  Each new series is amazing.  I would recommend Sanderson's books without reservation.<br /><br />I have rarely seen characters like his and worlds that are so creative.  I even wrote an email to the author, something I have never done before.  Do yourself a favor and pick one up.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|this application works better than using the native Android browser but seems to need a refresh for any updates.  all in all a good application.
B007HACDLK|4.0|See my other review about &#34;Kill Shot&#34; it is the same idea.  Vince Flynn is a safe read if a little over priced.
1400067820|3.0|The overall themes and ideas in this book are quite good.  In Black Swan Taleb established the inherit unpredictability of things.  This book is an attempt to show a collection of things that do not respond well to that unpredictability (fragile) and a collection of things that actually gain from unpredictability (anti-fragile).  Along the way broader themes showing characteristics of fragile and anti-fragile are laid out.  Good information on a relevant topic.<br /><br />That said, this book is almost unreadable.  Taleb's previous books have always had an air of arrogance, but in this book the arrogance has crossed into disdain for the entire world outside of his own person.  Besides telling limo drivers to \\"f*** off\\" he spends a lot of time coming up with derogatory terms for groups of people and individuals.  It feels rather like an elementary school child calling someone a poop-head because they didn't play nicely with him at recess.<br /><br />I think in his mind individuals and their ideas cannot be separated, starting with himself.  There is a lot of irrelevant personal things about Taleb in the book.  I see these as explaining himself because his ideas and his self-identity are so linked he cannot separate them.  This would also explain so many of his attacks, in attacking ideas he disagrees with he cannot separate those ideas from the people who he sees as representing those ideas so he attacks those people as well.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of Taleb's books I'd suggest starting with The Black Swan[[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan]].  If you have already read Taleb's other work you may find the ideas in this book interesting if you are able to get past the writing style.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|I'm just going to write the same review and attach it to all of Brandon Sanderson's books that I have read.  I have been reading science fiction fantasy novels for about 30 years.  I enjoy the genre but lets face it, most books follow &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; in character and style when it comes to magic stuff cause how can you not when it's the pinnacle.<br /><br />Anyway I digress.  Sanderson is the first author to come along that completely broke the mold.  I was totally floored by his books and have bought basically everything else he has written.  Each new series is amazing.  I would recommend Sanderson's books without reservation.<br /><br />I have rarely seen characters like his and worlds that are so creative.  I even wrote an email to the author, something I have never done before.  Do yourself a favor and pick one up.
0316069434|5.0|This book brings back memories of other Harry Bosch books as it starts out with Harry back in 1992 working with his former partner.  You are immediately captured by the drama and violence surrounding the riots after the Rodney King verdict.<br /><br />Michael Connelly is a master story-teller and this Harry Bosch novel proves it once again.
B000005KQT|4.0|This was Muddy Waters harmonica man and he made his harp stand out by blowing it into the microphone so he wouldn't be drowned out.  Butterfield, Brian Jones, Junior Wells, all influenced by this man.  Lived hard and drank hard.  Died way too young as a result.  A legend.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|I had to buy it second time since someone stolen first one. I went to many different stores as all was sold out but now it came back.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy on Blue Ray looks exceptional.  The box set comes with a booklet filled with sketches and photos of the memorable villians in each film.  The book also includes life size photos from different angles of the Bat motorcycle.
B000065V42|5.0|I only wish that the regular movie stars in this movie could have starred in the sequels.  Rick Moranis is a good actor and so was the actress who played his wife.  The special effect of growing small was superably done and Disney owes much thanks to the special effects director.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|This book left me feeling sick to my stomach. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to dwell on the mental health issues of society. It is beyond the dark reads that thrill me.
B008XBASVY|5.0|The only reason why i wanted to read this book was because I think Chris Colfer  is amazing. but when i started reading the book, I was hooked on! i loved it so much. i cried at the end! i think that Carson's sarcasm is hilarious. malerie is too funny. this cook is like, infinity stars! so perfect! Love Chris, Love this book!
B0016K40KO|5.0|It is a great movie.  I must admit that I do not ordinarily enjoy war movies.  But this movie brought to my mind a syndrome called the Stockholm Syndrome.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves is an excellent wrap up to Helen's story. Can't wait to read what happens next to agent Pendergast.
B00001QEBQ|4.0|great movie great dvd inexpensive<br />good birthday present glad i bough it and will use it for many years to come;
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I think most people will love this album since every single song is top notch and its BY FAR the best of the trilogy. Green Day fans shouldn't be disappointed nor should music fans in general.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Read in one day and four boxes of extra things to donate.  Can't wait to tell my family about this book.
B00006ADFL|5.0|A psychedelic trip retelling the story of a classic murder that occurred in New Zealand.  Kate Winslett and Melanie Lynskey play teenage girls with an obsessive love who try to kill the mother of one (Melanie) when they are about to be separated.  This is a true story and visually spectacular, focusing on the obsessive love of the girls and the deluded world of fantasy they fall into to escape their dull realities.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  It definitely kept my interest.  The problem  was that I felt like I was walking down the hall in Jr. High.  The main characters seemed to know only two words:  the a-word and the s-word (okay 3--I think the F bomb was dropped).  When the use of such words is redundant, it sounds like they have an IQ of a mosquito.  These guys are supposed to be incredibly intelligent operatives.  Their language made it unbelievable.  I wish filmmakers would catch a clue that swearing lessens the quality of the film.  I don't think I could stand to watch it again for that reason.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|to give an album like this a bad review just confuses me, what more do people want?, if ur a fan of stone sour or corey taylors work in general u shouldnt have a problem with this album, yeah its different and thats what u should expect but its still a stone sour sound its not like the genere changed or anything, people just complain too much
0061433063|5.0|Funny stuff, the first two books of the Tiffany Aching series.  I love thes books and read them to my daughter nightly.  She is one but loves them too, particularly the Nac Mac Feegle (CRIVENS!).  I recommend thse stories to any Prathcett fans, and as a good intro for those who are not familiar with his work.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is a must see!  My entire family is in love with Alfie Boe.  He is extraordinary.  We have watched it over and over again!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I heard about the upcoming movie and decided to read the book first. It was my first &#34;ebook&#34; !. I loved it. The story was great. Lots of twists and turns and of course a good ending. I like &#34;good feeling&#34; books. The world surrounds us with sad and tragic things. I don't want to entertain myself with the same thing. Give me a good clean love story (no smut) and I will follow you anywhere!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I think this game was really interesting. it had a variety of puzzles to keep you occupied and engaged. the first half of the game is free! but in order to play the rest of the game you have to pay three dollars. for how much game there is I think it should only be a dollar.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Entertaining and interesting.  I'm not sure it would appeal so people under the age of 50 or to most men.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love music and I have played the piano and was also in the orchestra for seven years with the violin.  This is really amazing and fun.
8866130923|5.0|This planner is the best!  I had the softcover one for 2012. This one is so much better because the hard cover strangely limits the bulk.<br /> There is enough room to write down appointments and the blank sheet on the opposite side off the week is great for taking notes or creating to-do lists. I don't suspect I'll be changing planners for years to come. It's chic and beautiful. The only down side is the red is a little too bright but that's because I'm not the hugest fan of bright red!<br />Love this planner. Highly recommended!
B003I55BIA|5.0|Had a great story line! I'm telling all my friend about this top notch book! Simon is a great writer!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Great easy reading book. Very interesting book. Can't believe things like this are still happening in the world after all these years.

B000FBJEL0|4.0|I love his books and this is just another one in a long line of good novels.  Thank you for your work .
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never had any problems from the app. Enjoy the game and works well. I would recommend this to anyone. Ads are an issue but any free app has those.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time on facebook and now I can play it on my kindle!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|These cases are great. They have a rubber texture to them for good grip. My daughter has dropped my kindle a couple of times and I credit this case to saving the kindle. We just bought her own kindle for Christmas and she loves this pink color.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|First purchased this for daughter (she's in her 20s).<br />She was thrilled, even tho she had seen most of the episodes.<br />We got to watch half of the first season with her, before she left & took the DVDs with her.<br />So, I just might have to purchase another set for myself!<br />Purchased sets for 2 other families when it was a gold box deal!  One family's younger members recognized it & was thrilled, other family wasn't familiar with it, but I'm sure that they will love it.<br /><br />The character development is so well done.  The costumes are exquisite!  I'm hoping to watch it over & over to take in the details.<br />I
0062209493|5.0|I highly recomend this book. Great story and the CDs are a good quality. Great sequencing and just enough detail.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|If you like the Percy Jackson series or even Harry Potter type books, you will really enjoy this book!  enjoy!
B009R8DJ72|5.0|It was very exciting interesting and funny thrilling too<br />I  could not stop reading  .I will like to recommend this<br />To an anxious reader
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Alot better than I thought it would be! We laughed and enjoyed this movie very much ! Give it a try!
B00881VLCE|4.0|App is awesome! Great for puzzle lovers. The selection is good, lots of different designs and pictures to choose from.
B00006FM77|5.0|This was a gift for my husband a big Chicago fan. He loves it and listens to it all the time.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|What can I say? No one can sing a song like Ms. Streisand. \\"Didn't we?\\" and \\"How are things in Gomorrah? are gems. But in truth, the whole album is priceless.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|i am a huge fan of hidden object games and, up to now, have been very disappointed by the meager offerings for kindle. however, this game gives me hope. the storyline is excellent, hob scenes fun and the puzzles interesting. although the price is a little high, i don't mind paying it when a game is high quality and this one is.  i gave it a 4 instead of a 5 for two reasons..price and cut scenes that were somewhat low quality.  other than those two things, it's a great game.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I think this book was very funny. I think it is good for ages nine through twelve. I would read the next ones.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|doesnt work shows only like 10 sec video but after that it crashes plz fix it.It may still have potential.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very good game and very well thought out puzzles to play I would definitely play this one again looking forward to the sequel.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|i purchased this book on my kindle a long time ago. i started reading it and was very into it. i got side tracked and i'm not all together sure if i ever got a chance to finish this one. i will have to bring it back up to see.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is a very fun puzzle game. There's no element of time so you can take as long as you need to try to get all 3 stars in each level. If you enjoy Cut The Rope, you should enjoy this game too, I know I do!
B0091REZMW|3.0|keeps me busy and I like a challenge so,  buy this if you like mystery games and like to find objects.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|You can always rely on Fiona to bring out the feelings you never knew you had, but this album uses so many different styles and tones we're not used to seeing from her. I feel like she lets loose on this one in her music and her emotions like never before. Love, love, love this album! Love Miss Apple!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|ive been playing for about a day now and its still going. its pretty intuitive and I haven't really gotten stuck yet at all. it could stand to be slightly harder. Attempting to upgrade to the paid version of this game is seriously annoying. I have yet to actually be able to upgrade, it just gets stuck each time.
B007Z9QY1S|3.0|The film was okay. I thought it was about a writer, writing a biography of W. E not having an obsession over the two lovers. It's was good, not great though.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Morrie's story is somber, and raw.  There are no hidden agenda's, and his story speaks volumes of truth of what is truly important in this life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best app in the world. I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed temple run, although subway surfers is better. best game EVA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|First let me say that I absolutely love Fiona's music. Her melody's are wonderful, and I have all of her albums.  I love every song on every album except this one.  I have played this cd about 20 times trying to give it a chance. It's not near what she is capable of. Most of the songs have no melody what so ever.  None.  It's not music.  I think she lost a lot when she left some of her old bandmates and writing partners behind. I hope this is not a downward run for her like Nora Jones.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I now appreciate the sacrifice of our seal teams.  For all the missions that we never hear about, where they are putting their lives on the line.  And for all those fallen, who have given the ultimate sacrifice.<br />I also have a new found appreciation for the Pashtun tribal laws, and in this particular case the tribe that preserved this young American life.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Exciting, fun and a page turner, great book.  THis book lives up to the other titles and builds the story of Jac Ruan Jr.
B00000JXVK|5.0|The best motorcycle movie of all time. Bruce Brown's narration makes the movie.  Steve, Malcolm, Mert, what can ya say about these guys except cool!  Plus its filmed in the 70's, great time.
B007XF0X16|1.0|I was excited to watch this on Blu-ray.  We enjoyed the movie but it does not have the same quality as other blue-rays. The packaging was normal but the disk it white.  It plays pixelated with the colors distorted the way a DVD would play on HD TV.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|What a great read! Hard to put down. The dedication and commitment these guys give is incredible.  And this guy beets a drug addiction!! Sad at the end- had tears running down my face..... Those guys sacrifice so much for our country, they are a very rare breed of tough individuals! !!!
B001C1066E|4.0|Was smaller than the other one I bought a month ago, as I got one for each of my sons. And the latch was tighter and a little harder to open than the first as well. But none the less will serve its purpose and be a tiny money pouch for my boys. Its not ment to hold a great deal of money but good for coins or just for pretend play.
0618526412|3.0|The book is nothing like the movie, which for once was much better than the book. The movie was outstanding.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up Is one of the cutest movies I have seen. It is one of those Disney / Pixar movies you won't forget. Very enjoyable and a lovely storyline and meaning. One of my absolute faves.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Wow, how one moment can change your whole life. Tell your kids you love them every day, life is so uncertain. Jaycee was not only taken captive, but a prisoner of time and prisoner in her mind. Her coping skills were amazing.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great CD. Had never heard her belore getting this CD, but it was recommeded by a friend. Did I mention great CD.
B007SGM084|5.0|THis was an awesome trilogy, I am so happy I bought the bundle, it was great to have all 3 books ready on my kindle.
B00979CS50|5.0|Great new album and wonderful for road trips!  New material which was haunting in its sincerity and connection to life and love!
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|Very funny spoof of action thrillers with an ALL-STAR cast. Do YOU remember Ernest Borgnine? He looks great. Wouldn't recommend doing this at home, of course, but one of the better old-guys-rock comedies.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This version of AccuWeather definitely beats the website version I use on my stay-at-home PC.  All the information is available in a quickly-accessible way.  In addition, the format is easy to read, visually pleasing and compliments the data being presented.  It was a pleasant surprise to find such a top-notch app available at no cost!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I used to doodle and draw stick figures in school way back in the 1980s and now a dream comes true:<br />You can draw a stick figure and his imaginary friend and they actually come alive and start an adventure.<br />You draw your way through this adventure and paint whatever you need - like fire.<br />What a great surprise to find this as a FAOTD on New Year's Eve.<br />Highly recommended for all ages.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|tried the free one and got stuck on a level and then got really frustrated! did not want to pay to get to the next level
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Carry On is hands down my favorite song. All of the songs are interesting and don't have the sameness that most songs in an album have. One Foot is really interesting and represents the album as a whole. It starts very anti-religion and ends with the singer questioning himself. The album is really cool, upbeat and easy to listen to.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Hours of fun, and sometimes frustration, and at a great price.  Great way to spend some time when there is really nothing going on.
B0086HGW42|4.0|Ed is a great lyrcist and some of his ballads have melodic lines that make your eyes water. Overall there are some really good tracks like Drunk.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The update during Dec 2012 was a nice improvement from the previous app.  My phone used to select every email I came close to touching, even if I was trying to scroll.  This seems to only select if you press near the selection box(es).  Much better on my cheap phone!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Honestly, I would give  this 5 stars however it was just not for me. If you like journal entries, this is perfect. I just am not a fan of rambling nonsense. I like ideas that flow and connect, not jump around.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Love, cried like a baby, but I loved!!!! Going to read the next book ASAP!!! Thumbs up for this novel
B0076DELIG|2.0|Dull story and charactersVery slow moving. Dull dull dull...........Too wordy at times....kept thinking it would get better...it didn't..to my regret and waste of time....
B00881VLCE|4.0|This app was my favorite on kindle fire. It was working great. Until my app stopped working and i had go reinstall. Now it only gives me 54 pieces total.  Im very disappointed and want to know how to fix it to get 277 piecres?
B0095T3H2U|5.0|This was a great movie!  Super funny and I hope to own it soon.  Jason Segel is awesome as always!  Great movie for deep belly laughs!
B006G7R25W|5.0|This is one of the best action movies of the time in the 60's and this is the first time that i have seen it in over 40 years and still love the storyline and suspense!And it was JUST as it was then,with the intermission'&#34;Time to hit the bathroom and nuke some popcorn&#34;,LOL!The picture and audio were even better than i remember it at the theater way back when :-)
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I bought this book for my 6th grader & wanted to read it first. It was a well written story that brings you to directly into the main character's world. The characters are vibrant and well rounded. I would have liked more development and background of some of the main characters but maybe then it wouldn't be a children's book & be too long. I enjoyed the read & look forward to my son's reaction'm
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Saw this in the theater and I was an emotional mess, as pregnancy can be.  This movie is so funny and I highly recommend it.  I hope it own it soon!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Solitaire online: I cannot figure how to turn over 3 cards at a time instead of 1. Otherwise, its ok.
B003UESJHY|2.0|The DVD/blu ray case was punctured as soon as I opened it, doesn't vouch well for the integrity of the product.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This was perfect for my Iphone 4S!  Looks cute and I don't have to worry about protecting my phone which is great because I have 2 girls that love to take my phone and play with it.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Another page Turner. I couldn't put it down. Attorney David Zinc has found his calling by time you're done reading this tale of David and goliath.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|lots of fun and it keep your mind working would tell friends about this game ! ! ! ! !
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Super cute movie that is fun for whole family!  Cute movie, great message and lots of laughs!  Be sure to watch
B0044DEAUA|1.0|I purchased 2 of these for me and my husband, they both died within the month... I liked it while it worked, just wish I hadn't wasted my money.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to games but this one is a lot of fun in its simplicity and design.  Great job guys!
B003JTHWPA|5.0|The book was downloaded quickly and was an enjoyable read.  Great amazon experience!  Will definitely down load more books onto my kindle.
034580404X|5.0|I had a hard time waiting for this trilogy being delivered to me as I had already read the first book of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and wanted more. Believe me I spent many of hours of reading enjoyment, even rereading the trilogy a second time. I would recommend this trilogy to any woman with a open mind just enjoying a romance read. Waiting for the movie now.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I like the way the trama goes , usually I can predict how the history will go ; but in this one  , I was sourprice that 'Rick' was one of the bad guys !!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Very good moving, it puts a human spin on the Batman franchise. I highly recommend anyone to see this movie.
B005HSL626|1.0|stops working constantly and gets an error message on my child's tablet, had to uninstall it. Needs better support would not recommend it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is easily among the top 3 best mobile games I've ever played. The visuals are stunning, the gameplay is fun and interesting, and the world created reaches up to incredible classics like Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country. You will not be disappointed!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have loaded this app onto all of my portable devices. It allows me to read and study the scriptures anytime, anywhere. Allows the user to choose from among a large variety of translations too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was so great that I had to have the next two books! I just couldn't wait for my library thing to finally let me have them!
B002JVWR9U|3.0|I got this for my sister, and we watched the first episode.  It wasn't that great, we probably won't watch anymore of it.  The acting is not so great and the story is the same old tired vampire love story.  The vampire is falls in love with a girl and he's trying so hard not to eat her.  It's a rip off of Twilight.  There are so many vampire series and movies out there that you should try to look elsewhere.  I saw Fright Night a week ago, it's really good, watch that.  If you're looking for a series, maybe try True Blood, a lot of my friends who are girls always talk about how great it is.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Ok book. Kinda makes you think about life, but seemed too depressing for me. The grammar was not great either.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|That is a really  sad book :(  what happens now what's her next book? 6 more words come on arrrr
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|my child loves this game. we play together if she cant beat one of the levels.I think its fun too!
B005USZYDU|5.0|It was thrilling and neat. I would recommend this book. It's a good book for 10-12 year old children. Awesome book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is absolutely worth the price, it brings out all of the senses and makes you feel as if you were inside the story.<br />You can experience the magic of nature, how a tiger and a human despite of their enormous differences, fight together to survive in the ocean.<br />I extremely recommend it.<br /><br />If you're going to see the movie, read the book first.
