B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this product and have owned it for over 2 years now. I use it for every game I play. It makes long gaming sessions easy and comfortable. The back-lighting is great and customizable. It is versatile, easily programmed, and the support-community forums provide answers for even the most obscure questions. Of all the gaming peripherals I have owned, this is my favorite. I use it heavily and it has never malfunctioned. If it ever breaks, I will replace it immediately.      Edit (8/27/2014): A couple of weeks ago, my G13 finally malfunctioned due to the hours and hours of use I subjected it to. I took it as an opportunity to order the Razer Orbweaver for comparison purposes. After 60+ hours of use of the Orbweaver, I concluded that I still prefer the Logitech G13 and ordered a second one. For those of you wondering why I didn't like ther Orbweaver, here is the review I wrote after two months of use:    \\"I have used both the Orbweaver and the Logitech G13 for prolonged gaming sessions (40+ hours logged on each). While the Orbweaver has mechanical buttons (so nice!), the design of the thumb stick renders it imprecise/impossible to use for anything other than camera or movement. The customization options for the ergonomics is nice, but I didn't find that if made much of a difference in my comfort or ease of use. The Razer Synaspe program necessary to program the keys is a pain to use and there is no macro recording on the fly.     Personally, I preferred the functionality and comfort of the Logictech G13 to the Orbweaver. The G13 has more programmable buttons and the thumb stick is more functional for how I use it. The G13 is also significantly cheaper and has a progammable LCD. The Logitech Gaming Software is much easier to use and more flexible in functionality due to being able to directly code using LUA. While the G13 is not mechanical, I have not had any problems gaming with it.    If mechanical keys are a deal-breaker, the Orbweaver will fulfill your requirements, but it is my opinion that the Logitech G13 is the better overall product for the above listed reasons. If only Logitech would release a mechanical G13. . . \\"
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It keeps you drawn in from beginning to end. The ending had my heart racing and tears flowing. Absolutely amazing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played this game on cousins ipad and loved it. could not wait for his game to hit the amazon market.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great detailed account of the killing of Bin Laden. Kudos to Seal team six. Thank you to the greatest military in the world
B000ICXQXI|4.0|i had to watch this movie for a film class and was presently surprised by the film. It was good and i loved the lighting and chill you get throughout watching it
B00454U1NS|4.0|I was traveling when we were delayed so I was looking for an upbeat album for my kindel fire so I would have something to listen to. It said it could only come on a Cd so I cancelled the order. When I arrived home their was the Cd I called amazon to see what happened with my order. They were very helpful. I kept it cause I loved it so much. Next time I will make sure to read the small print to see if it can be down loaded to my kindel.
B00782O7IY|5.0|For years, (since it came out), my all-time favorite movie was Braveheart. Now it's The Artist. I know, I'm probably over-reacting. But this is one clever movie that really gets to you. If someone is a film buff, the fact that it is silent makes it even more intriguing because the filmmakers use that to help tell their story. That may be an obstacle, initially, for the non-film buff. But after 30 minutes, they'll be hooked. It took me all of five minutes to be caught up in the lives of these very likable characters during a very interesting period in movie history - the transition of Hollywood from silent pictures to sound.<br /><br />Rarely do I see a movie that I would call \\"perfect\\"... but this one is. It has everything: a wonderfully touching story, great performances, beautiful cinematography and score. The one thing it lacks is sound. That's right - it's a silent film. Because it is about a silent movie star, the producers decided to make the film itself silent. When I first heard about it, I doubted that a silent film would work today, let alone get to me - but it did. It is the most delightful film I've seen in a long, long time. The details of late 1920s Hollywood, when sound movies were making their debut, are perfect: no film has ever been successful at capturing that period, in my opinion - until now.<br /><br />With great charisma and charm, French actor Jean Dujardin portrays silent film star George Valentin (loosely based on Douglas Fairbanks), the hottest idol in Hollywood, and someone who really enjoys the spotlight. Then he meets Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), a young woman who wants to break into film herself. George is taken with her and decides to give her a break; in the process, they fall in love. Then sound enters the picture, and movies go from silent to talkies almost overnight. As George, who is unequipped for this change, watches his star fall, Peppy's rises meteorically. It's a classic love story set against the most turbulent years of Hollywood.<br /><br />The filmmakers masterfully use the medium of silent film to tell their story in a very poignant and very clever way that took the Oscars by storm, winning it Best Picture. Dujardin also won Best Actor at Cannes and the Golden Globes for his performance, and the film itself won Best Comedy and Best Score at the Golden Globes. There are many nods to Hollywood icons, including Singing In The Rain (which deals with the same time period), A Star Is Born (which, like The Artist, deals with the rise of a young actress and the fall of an older actor), Asta (the scene-stealing dog from The Thin Man series), etc. John Goodman is wonderfully cast against type as producer Al Zimmer. For those who love good movies, this one will steal your heart.llywood.<br /><br />The filmmakers masterfully use the medium of silent film to tell their story in a very poignant and very clever way that took the Oscars by storm, winning it Best Picture.

B009E3EY38|5.0|Amazing performance on all levels.  Love it !  The surprise was how great Plant's voice was throughout the performance.  Of course, Page's playing was amazing (as was everyone else). Long live Led Zeppelin !
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love the games from this company. The graphics are beautiful! The puzzles are challenging without being too hard. I don't mind paying the extra amount for the full game.  Definitely try it out!
B009H2PCNC|5.0|Another classic Eno recording in the classic sense of 'Music For Airports' ... the more I listen to this, the more it keeps changing and the more I love it.  A must listen of the Eno Catalog.
B008EKOO46|5.0|I was widely impressed by this mass analysis of modern verses traditional societies. There so much introspection to be gleened from considering our societal norms, traditions, morals, and just all the ways and means in which we conduct our lives. To take these faucets and to really analyse them, to find better ways of living, is a powerful tool. To his credit, I believe this is Jared Diamonds best work yet, with very personal stories of field work in New Guinea and experiences with his own wife and children. An Excellent Read.
B008V59AFW|5.0|Excellent re-master of this classic release from Gabriel ... and the Live in Athens recording shows the breath of these musicians in a live setting.  Overall, a must listen for all Gabriel fans.
B002RVCD0U|2.0|As a sequel of the Terminator 1-3 movies,<br />this is a complete failure.<br />Greatly inferior to its predecessors<br />with regard to every aspect that I can think of.<br />Given that it is a post-apocalyptic war movie,<br />I expected it to be different,<br />but it was only tangentially related<br />to the other movies...<br />a few references here and there.<br />I expected this fourth movie to tie up the<br />complex time travel issues with resect to<br />Kyle Reese and the various terminators,<br />the timeline and the technology<br />and all the things that happened during that<br />future time.<br />I also expected further development<br />of the characters of Kyle Reese and John Connor<br />and perhaps even Sarah Connor and Kate Brewster,<br />concluding with the victory over the machines.<br />It does not deliver on any of those.<br />We do not see the future events we expect.<br />Then there is the completely unnecessary addition<br />of the Cyborg from the past and the warrior-babe<br />who loves him.<br />To the exclusion of the main plot lines! Why?<br /><br />In addition to poor plot, characters and dialog,<br />I was also disappointed by the score.<br />When I saw the name of Danny Elfman in the credits,<br />I naturally expected a very creative score,<br />but it was essentially by-the-numbers scoring.<br /><br />This is a movie that succeeds only as a<br />rather mediocre action movie<br />with some very cool FX, explosions, fights,<br />military battles, chases and stuff<br />involving characters that one doesn't care about<br />one way or the other.<br /><br />If you love the Terminator movies,<br />you won't be missing anything<br />if you don't see this one.<br />Let's hope a real sequel is made someday.
B008RTE09S|5.0|What can I say - it's the bloody Beatles !  While somewhat self-indulgent, the music alone is worth the price of admission.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I would recommend to all fans of fiction, sci-fi, fantasy,& mythology. The Heroes of Olympus is even better than the first Percy Jackson series. The adventures, and issues, the heroes tackle are getting deeper and more provocative.<br />Great Job, Rick Riordan
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I wasn't sure what this game was all about, but now that I started playing it, it can be a mental challenge.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Funny, believable and just plain exciting. This was a fun read with plenty of excitement and very sexy. Was better than I expected.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game as its good for killing the time. very mindless. my 18yr old sister loves watching me play lol
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|We loved this movie until we got to the end.  Beautiful scenery, great story...We were disappointed by the real life ending.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Amazing story of a true Folk artist, How such a talent can  go unnoticed is beyond comprehension. this is the best<br />movie/docu of 2012 hands down.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Pretty awesome to know how much time in hours and minutes especially if like me  you use the kindle fire a lot
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Halestorm's second album is filled with great songs.  Including rock radio mainstays \\"Love Bites (So Do I)\\" and \\"I Miss the Misery,\\" the album has several other great tunes, including the rocking \\"Mz Hyde\\" and \\"Freak Like Me,\\" the beautiful ballad \\"Break In,\\" and the pounding \\"Daughters of Darkness.\\"  If you enjoy modern hard rock with the more rare female singer, you will likely enjoy this album.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  I really enjoyed it and didn't see the twist coming at the end.  Well written too.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|Got this to monitor my recordings.<br /><br />For sound quality, it's a good buy for this price. Very balance sound with correct high and low frequencies.<br /><br />But is very uncomfortable. I can't keep this for more than 5 minutes on my head.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show! Very unique and stylish! Jessica Lange is brilliant! The rest of the cast is great as well: Sara h Paulson, Lily Rabe, Naomi Grossman
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun, free and to relax and enjoy yourself this is version with touch screen is excellent. Taking a break a fun game and easy to understand and keep a active mind as well. Appreciaton to Amazona.
B008602KQI|4.0|I don't think I would have liked the movie with a different actress.  I never read the books but she made the movie a good movie and not just a movie you watch because you liked the book.  The movie did good on standing on its own.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey at the end of the second season. I really enjoyed it but I was a little lost.  I found season 1 on Streaming Video so when I finished with that I needed Season 2.  I ordered it just in time because Season 3 had started and after watching the first episode I was lost. Now I'm caught up and have actually gotten my husband hooked.  I loved watching Season 2 of Downton Abbey whenever I wanted to.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I hate glee.  Who sings that much??  No one in reality.  This movie was good because it had some funny moments. The singing was corny but the movie was good enough to get past it :)
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I am totally statisfied with my case and it works great, the plug in to charge is a little difficult but you have to admit it is new and things need to be wore in.  Also the shipping was so fast and I am very impressed just because I was told not to expect it till febuary and I recieved it 4 days later. Thank you so much
B00B19DMUE|5.0|I thought thus movie was great, pretty scary and good story line to tie it all in. Worth my time for sure and would recommend it to my friends.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it is like watching paint dry you can never go wrong with the original. now I will delete it promptly from my fire!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love the Alien movies and Sigourney Weaver is my hero so to love this movie is pretty much a given.  I didn't like the end though.  To not give too much away but voice my distain:  The 'thing' that came out of the 'thing' was not expected and I HATED the way they made it look.  Really?  Teeth like that?  For real??  The older movies did way better in designing the 'thing' and they started in the 70's!!  Give me the 70's version any day.
B004WR125O|2.0|Very Easy Set up but connectivity in my small 1 story 2100' home is not normally good enough to even connect to Pandora?
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I liked this movie.  I definately didn't see the story going in that direction so it definately helped it not to be so predictable.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great book series whether you have watched the adapted series or not.  The two compliment each other very well and give you  a bit more insight.
B006QQCCOY|5.0|I thought this film was full of terrible characters, but the innuendo is great. The screenplay is great and you just have to get over every Preston's drama
0316023744|4.0|Yes, I enjoyed reading this book. It gave me a good look inside WW II. I could see what was taking place in all the theaters of war at the same time.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|With all the s*** that happened in 2012 it's nice to see a movie full of feel good moments and companionship.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|its is lame and when you turn the screen turns and the guys legs don't move.and you don't get as many people and upgrades. I personal don't like it the only good thing about is that you swing on the rope.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I liked it but I think the price was too high. Maybe more of a two dollar rental than a five
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great combination of historic drama and romance.  Says here I have to submit at least 13 more words.  That's stupid!
B000W4SE6G|5.0|I don't know why everyone doesn't watch this movie as a part of being human. This is such a deep film.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book doesn't waste any time grabbing the readers attention. I love how Flynn gets to the point and doesn't bore readers with mundane details or side stories. This book is unlike any I've ever read and I love Camille in all of her disturbed heroism.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Now, I must tell you that I have always despised HO games and avoided them like the plague. I've always found them boring and annoying. At least that was my opinion until I downloaded this game. It changed my views of HO games forever. I originally only downloaded the game because the artwork looked interesting and because I was so hesitant to play this type of game, I got the free version first. Well that sure was pointless! Almost immediately I got sucked into the storyline and I played nonstop. When I was asked to buy the full version, I wasted no time in doing so. This is actually quite a big deal since I almost never pay for apps. I probably played this for a few hours before finishing, not once stopping to take a break. The plot was refreshing, artwork amazing, and game in general just overall wonderful. G5 can definitely expect to see me buying future games. Keep up the good work!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It was beautifully made and designed to pass your time! This game will keep you playing for HOURS and even after you'll still want to keep playing
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|This is a nice story for kids with and adult story in parallel.  I enjoyed watching it with my daughter.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Im very impressed with this product. I love it because they were so cheap but yet they deliver quality sound. I use this when i go  to the gym and when i run or do cardio. Regular ear buds never stay on my head. These stay on and are really comfortable. I sweat a lot and it usually degrades the quality of my headphones. Ill probably purchase more of these just in case. They're so cheap I can afford to buy multiple.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|The movie dwelt on the very NEGATIVE of the relationship. Once we got the picture what was happening .........move on. It did NOT!
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers come off the block with emphasis and soul. Their sound, a blend of Americana folk meets up beat tempo, is truly feel good music. Reflective and hopeful are two words to describe The Lumineers. To their credit, Dave Matthews Band, a long standing legend in the music industry, has asked The Lumineers to open for them on many of their stops. I had the pleasure to see them open or Dave at the Barclays Center. A riviting experience.
B00ANT9MZW|5.0|This movie has one of my favorite lines of all time. \\"So what do think of the girl?\\" \\"I think she's smart.\\" \\"We're all smart.\\"
0399143793|4.0|Keeps you turning the pages.  Can get bogged down in details.  I would recommend this author to my friends any time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am fascinated with history.  DowntonAbbey is well acted and completely true to the time period.  I can't think of anything I am disappointed in except for the fact that I have to wait a week for the next episode.  I truly hope it lasts at least until 1950 if not beyond.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Not worth the effort. I don't understand the hype. Poorly written and hard to follow.  Sorry book club.  I just didn't get it
B006LSZECO|4.0|I would give it five stars but I didn't like the ending. Definitely worth the read. I'll look for more by this author.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Definitely not as good as Gone Girl…much darker and very disturbing! I still could not put it down because it keeps you wanting to find out what happens next... Gillian Flynn is a fabulous writer, but don't read this if you don't enjoy a haunting, sickeningly descriptive murder mystery novel
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's really fun it's just like having a real horse. and you don't have to worry about the feed bill
B003XT603Q|5.0|When I was reading this, it didn't feel like I was reading Toru's accounts of his life, but my accounts of a life I hadn't lived. I don't know if it's Murakami'a phenomenal writing, or if it's simply a coincidence that I had love interests that reminded me of his characters.... But whatever it was, this book kept me captivated the entire time. I highly recommend it.
B00164KYV4|4.0|I enjoyed watching this ensemble romantic comedy. I liked the way it was put together with the question/answer parts as well. I would have enjoyed seeing an older couple in it as well.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Thank you for making it possible for my family and friends to enjoy this unique, awesome movie, my children really love it, we been watching this movie over and over and the delivery of this movie was so fast.  Thank for making it possible for me to have it in a very cheap price.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|This Blu-ray is reference quality. This movie was visually stunning on DVD, but this is a sight to behold. Black levels are phenomenal if you have a good HDTV.<br /><br />For a movie review, go to IMdB and Rotten Tomatoes.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The weather stations are a must have and have kept me up to date.  Very good buy for a needed product!  Love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy to follow, interesting from the start! I would like to meet the fellow that inspired these books!! Mr. Grey.. Mmmm...
0316228532|5.0|I haven't read any of the Harry Potter series, so I was curious to see if Ms. Rowling could deliver an adult novel.  She hit it out of the park.  One of my favorite kinds of books--complex, varied and interesting characters, and a draw-you-in narrative.  It is a pleasure to read a book that keeps you on your toes to pay attention to all the little details.  I am not the biggest fan of mysteries, but I love Ruth Rendell for the same reason.  Neither of these ladies dummy anthing down for the reader.  Every little detail is important as well as interesting.She portrays small town life with deadly accuracy, revealing all the petty (and not so petty) dealings that people have with each other.  A perfect example of the big fish in a small bowl theory.  I laughed, I cried and I hated it to end.  No novel is perfect, but this one was pretty darn close.  All I can say to JK Rowling is to quote Oliver Twist. \\"More please\\".
B004SKQAJI|5.0|He is so great that I am discouraged to watch anything else. He attracts as a magnet. He is definitely the best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game because some horses are make believe like the unicorns I LOVE the rainbow unicorn that's my favorite one thank you for making this game.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This Sherlock is a bit abrupt, but so was the old one. He reminds me of the old saying regards a man accused of being conceited, and he replies... &#34;Conceit's a fault, and I don't have any.&#34; Still, the interaction between the two chief actors is getting more pleasing and useful. It is a good series so far, and getting better.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I give this book a five star rating. It keeps your interest and Danielle Steele is also my favorite author.
6304100507|5.0|What more can you say? Disney at a time before they got going with a lot of mysticism, witchcraft and other assorted junk, a good tail (tale) and enjoyable for the youths.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Wow! !!!! I got chills. Like nothing I have ever read. I literally got attached to this little boy. Such an amazing book... Wow!
B00A77II0U|4.0|line. Graphics were very nice as well. There is a little too much of &quot;Find the Hidden Object&quot; scenes in the game,  but it was very fun to play. Takes up a ton of internal storage on the device which is a downside because I had to uninstall other games to play. I would definitely play again....worth the $2.99 I paid for it. I also recommend playing on the more challenging game play.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is one game that is fun,timed ,challenging and addictive because you don't want to stop until you get to<br />the next level.I recommend this to those who want to just to have fun.
0307352145|5.0|This is one of those books I dog-eared page after page. Susan Cain provided up to date research about introversion. I thought I would learn more about the great introverts of the world and how they achieved greatness, but the book is full of other great stuff so I wasn't disappointed. Read it.
B005HSL626|3.0|At my age I much prefer games that are not timed. This would be a great game for the younger generation, but my reflexes just aren't good enough any more.  I think my grandsons would have a ball with this!
B0076DELIG|2.0|I have read all of Harry Bosch's books and find this book the worse one, CAN I SAY \\"BORING\\"!!! pat lilley, nc
B001O4XWJM|4.0|Really brought the Robert B. Parker novel to life -- a focus on the characters, dialog and plot, not on extraneous action sequences.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read relating the World War II aviation.  It gave me a perspective about an individual in the German Airforce that I did not know existed and, how the lives of an American bomber pilot and a German fighter pilot came together over Germany.  Very good read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much more entertaining then the first one!! It's packed full of action with good graphics. Been waiting for it on the kindle! :D  works great and u won't get bored! :D
B001AQO3QA|4.0|This set is worth purchasing for the sole pleasure of watching Alien and Aliens in a superb picture.  The box is very nice as is the bonus features.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The way the author described things was incredible. I would recommend this novel to a kid who enjoys eye popping magic and character. It felt like I was almost their with Percy during his wild adventure. Although I loved this book I wouldn't recommend reading this at night. Thank you Rick for writing this amazing book. I Kerrie is exited to read the next Percy Jackson book.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I got this as the app of the day and it has some of the things from mincemeat and somethings they made on there own that I like. The x y z locations is great and the glowing stones and sponsors hit the spot the only complaints with the game is sometimes it won't let me place a block and I have  to sit there for a minute or so to place a block. The quests were nice but I cannot find Palm trees or there leaves. The car is great. The trade for blocks is nice. The people can get in the way. The floating islands are a great idea. And the animal chooses were good. The monsters are creative and were very good. It worth playing in your free time
B00000J2PH|5.0|I have bought this in several formats and was time to get the CD.  I love that Amazon also put in on my Cloud Player for me.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Not Eastwood's best, I'm thinking Grand Torino, but a light hearted romp. No movie could be bad with Amy Adams in it, and Justin Timberlake holds up well in this comedy. Just ignore the silly plot and you will be glad you watched it at home, rather than in the theater.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book was good but I really dont think it was alltogether a huge hit by know means. It was just a ok read.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|A really good movie for the younger viewers. Adults may find it a little too predictable, but the little ones will enjoy it
B003F5NSTW|4.0|i thought[We need to talk about Kevin] was a very good read.Ifelt sorry for his mother and also very sad
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Not as action packed nor as exciting as the first book, but a great read all the same. Looking forward to the movie
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a pretty good book, although it is disturbing. The main thing I take from it is that humans can still be good and sacrifice for one another. I thought it a little too disturbing for young readers.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|A great book. Gripping, intense and very exciting. Very hard to put down. I haven't seen the movie, but after reading the book I am more likely tol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best horse app ever I'm a horseattic and I love horses even though I haven't got my own horse
B005EGXTL2|4.0|The final book of the trilogy. I found this one a little disappointing - the end seemed rushed. Seemed to lack the intensity of the previous 2 books, but still a good read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 it is so fun I watched the. trailer and I got it I also have temple run.
B0053O89WY|5.0|A huge family favorite. This is a show our entire family enjoy watching. Love the quirky characters. Looking forward to the next season
B007SXB498|5.0|All of Jane Austin's books are great, including this one.  It's handy to have this on my Kindle.  Thank you.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Excellent series. I got Kindle version, and in that i'm a smidge disappointed. The page marker advanced normally for the first book, but past the first book is just stuck at 694/694. Not a disaster, but still page# progress is better than either the % or the locations indicators.
1939416019|5.0|This was the best book.  It kept me reading until I put it down even though I finished it at midnight when I was supposed to be sleeping for midterms.  Whoops!  I loved Thor b/c it reminded me of Thor in the avengers when I first saw his name.  It's completely different than the Avengers, but it was still a fun thing to see.  I just about cried when I read the ending and saw that the second book wasn't out yet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game ever.  Its so much better than the first Temple Run.  I have been counting down the days for this release.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The Blu-ray arrived just in time, a big plus right off the bat.  The blu-ray's cover is amazing and quality is top notch.  I have no complaints, this product is perfect.
0307592731|1.0|It was difficult too see this book as a journey. Every time events in the author's life got either better or worse, she reverted to previous self indulgence activites involving sex and drugs.  Sex, drugs, lemonade and blisters were constants on and off the trail. Nothing has changed for her; except with the wild success of the book she has by now no doubt paid off her student loans, graduated from college, slept with a half dozen more men, and smoked, chewed or snorted the drugs of her choice.  What did she learn?  What did I learn? NOTHING life changing or worth while for either of us.
B009DJB8I2|2.0|The case was as brittle as a crumb cake, y'all. The top hinges are shattered. The 3rd CD was rolling around loose because the ring catcher was also broken. And the 4th CD has 2 small cracks in the center plastic part. Luckily it plays just fine but CMON now, this is such a hack job on the packaging!  I would rate zero stars but the music is so damn cool, but not everyone is as forgiving as I am.

B00A757EFW|3.0|It's fun....display is good, sound qualities are good, not quite the same without a joy stick to maneuver the chomper.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie was nothing like the other Bourne movies, and had I known that I would not have given a plug nickel to see this one.
B00417HV14|5.0|So there I was, visiting New Orleans for the first time in 2010. I looked up in the Internet for record stores in the area and the first one I visited was Odissey Records. Entering the store, I heard an amazing guitar solo and asked the manager who that guy was. The answer was obvious: \\"the new guitar hero in town\\", Joe Bonamassa. The song was \\"So Many Roads, So Many Trains\\" and you can understand why I was mesmerized by his performance. I have used this Blu-Ray to introduce JB to all of my friends in Brazil and the response is always the same: a lot of \\"Wow's\\". Don't spend any more time reading my review. Access the Internet, go to Amazon's website and buy it! In fact, buy the other DVD's from Joe as well. You won't regret it!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Arnold's total recall was better than this one by far. Remade movies nearly never get to the same level as the original. Doesn't anyone in Holywood read new things. Make something original please.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|I just bought a brazilian edition of this DVD. Not only I completed my collection of JB's videos but also got a chance to watch and listen to another bunch of great guitar solos and amazing musicianship from this guy, who will certainly become (maybe he already is) a legendary guitar player in the near future. Yes, some other reviewers pointed out some minor flaws, like too many camera shots and awful camera angles, but they didn't bother me at all. This is Joe, alive and kicking, young and on fire. For guitar lovers and JB's fans, this DVD is a must. The reason why I didn't give it five stars? \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" and \\"Beacon Theatre\\" DVD's are even better!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|A story about some one trying to preven himself from killing himself in the future is stupid. This Bruce Willis flix was an absolute flop. Don't waste your money to see it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|great wonderful app I love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love it so much!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I wish authors would stick to what they do best. I have read every single book producted by Tom Clancy, and as long as he was writing them by himself they were all great, but when he brings in some junior writer in the mix the books lose their flavor. Still a good story, but not on the level of a true Tom Clancy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love all of her books.  But his is probably my favorite.<br />I can't wait until she has a new one.
B000MQPU84|5.0|If you like Robert Mitchum you will like this movie. Although it is dated, crimes still occurs and the good guys always wear white hates, or they are on the side of right versus wrong.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Kewl game. always a backup time consumer. gives me a break and is fun. makes for a good time. thanks.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Once you start reading this book you can't put it down. I never expected the climax to be what it turned out to be. Awesome book thank you Colleen.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case!! Took me a while to get used to typing with the attached screen protector but now I love it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We love the first season but were skeptical about another whole new show with the same actors.  But you immediately forgot about their characters from last season as you were immersed in this asylum.  It is terrifying but awesome!
1423339851|4.0|It arrived faily quickly and was in good shape. I will look here for more audio book purchases. Oh Yes.
B000023VR6|5.0|A hip hop classic. Hard beats and rhymes.The best production. This is from the era of golden Hip Hop. Will never sound old or dated.
B000ESSTL0|3.0|Great album, fantastic music and very much their Pet Sounds.  I loved it when I was a senior in High School and love it today.  I was really looking forward to this one a lot becuase DM was made for surround sound.  And it delivers on most, less on others, but, some stuff is missing from the songs that are on the original release.  I know most say to buy the overseas SACD version, I got the US one.  Over all, it is what it is and still play it.  Added to the collection of SACD/DVD Audio, what the hell for the price.  If you are a die hard fan, get the SACD version.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|i like the fact that this animated film stayed true to the Irish culture and dialect. I love they way they talk.
B000Q7ZNEK|4.0|Enjoyed it.  Added it to my collection of SACD's and DVD Audio.  Pick it up, it is cheap and worth the price.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|i love the songs from this movie,and a very good story! Especially the song HOW BAD CAN I BE, really nice!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Very happy with the product. Great addition to my DVD collection. I am extremely glad I purchased the item in question.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Every page exciting, especially if you are familiar with the characters. Thank goodness for the Kindle as it is a big book. I would have liked a different ending using the strengths of other characters.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Very satisfied I bought this product. It comes in a really lovely holographic case a great addition to my movie collection.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this building game.There are only a couple of components I would change. The opportunity to earn more peanuts and the availability of gas and or chance to earn a bigger tank. I would put this game in my top five.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have been able to get my favorite christen channel, i listened to it for hours. The only problem is that some of the stations don't come or are nor clear. I would recommend this to others because you can hear what you like.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for my girls to play ages 4 and 6. it helps pass the time when we are waiting.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have always liked Rod Stewart, and this album/cd is very good, I spent many hours sewing and listening to it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book takes you in depth about the things that matter most to new Kindle authors and also the seasoned ones. It takes you by the hand and teaches you the fundamentals on formatting and that is the part I love the most. So with the information it gives you can decide if you want to hire someone to format or do it yourself. I would recommend this book to all Kindle Authors.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I really love this album.  Its been on repeat since I got it. A good mix of song.  From up beat to slow.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My wife and I had both read the reviews  and thought , well it can't be THAT bad .<br />It was and trust me, we try to not be judgemental  but this definitely lived up to the negatives.<br />The emperor has no clothes !
B005DVJQHY|5.0|The best, really opens your eyes.. Recommend it to anyone who really wants to move forward...This is the master key
0307887960|5.0|week one down 6 pounds, great recipes, great information.  My husband is also enjoying the foods and losing more weight of course.  Love it..
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game! very addictive, works on the kindle fire hd! fun for adults and kids. Can disable the real money purchasing options.
B00138KFYO|5.0|There has never been a voice like hers and there may never be again. She was a talent that left us way too soon. Her raw dedication to a performance and her mastery of the lyrics makes this a must for any music collection. And her band ain't bad either.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Talk about an unexpected ending!  It will leave you with your mouth open.  I would highly recommend this series to a Dexter fan.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Liked the movie and the price I paid for Amazon, would look out for such deals on movies. good to watch
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Loved every second of it!  It transported me back to high school in 1985. Watch it with your kids and show them that things weren't all that different 25 years ago.
B008LCRAC0|5.0|It's Jerry Seinfeld.  Very entertaining, and fun for trivia, as writers, producers, actors tell behind the scenes stories.  Great bloopers too.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|After 30 years, it's finally out on DVD! I just ordered it. Let me start by saying: I love this movie! From the first time I saw it with a girlfriend in the early 1980's to today, I still love this movie. I had the soundtrack and knew all of the songs before I saw the movie. It was interesting to see what songs went with what and of course, Barbra has a set of pipes unlike any other!<br />A-mazing! I get chills listening to all of these songs. Many of them are meaningful to me, especially Papa Can You Hear Me? Since my Dad has been gone 10 years this coming March, I think of him &#34;somewhere out there&#34; hoping he can hear me. The story, while panned by many, was an interesting premise. Likely? No, probably not. She couldn't have REALLY passed for a guy, but remember... it's a movie. For entertainment purposes and enjoyment. All of the principal characters were awesome: Barbra, Mandy Patinkin, Amy Irving, the guys from the school, her wise Papa. Some parts were touching, some tender, some funny (think of the scene where all the guys are going swimming in the nude and Avigdor tries to get Yentl to do it and she's panicked). The concept of women being able to study and learn may be something we take for granted, but back then, it just wasn't done. So for that alone, I love the movie, that she had the courage to reach for what she wanted, even though it was forbidden. While she couldn't cook and didn't want to dress up and try to catch a husband, she came alive when she was studying the Torah and interacting with the other guys at school, especially Avigdor. You can see that one coming a mile away :-) Not only is he gorgeous, smart and funny, they had an incredible chemistry with each other. So much happens, the &#34;marriage&#34;, the deception, her yearning to learn more. When she finally confesses to Avigdor that she isn't a guy and he is at first horrified and then feels relief because he was attracted to her is a very tender moment. You don't get to see what happens between them, so it's left up to you to decide whether they made love or not. They tell Amy Irving and she and Avigdor are married and wish Yentl well as she decides to come to America where the opportunities will be better for her. The ending scene when she's on the ship is one I carry with me all the time. It's the story of my ancestors and probably your ancestors, too. They leave their home country with nothing to come to America for a better life. The song &#34;A Piece Of Sky&#34; is the best one of all, full of hope, a little fear, desire, stepping into the unknown but willing to do it to reach for what she wants. I have often thought of the phrase &#34;that from my window I could only see a piece of sky&#34;. We've all seen that piece of sky and wondered what else there was. As she sings and moves through the ship, she gathers strength and belts out &#34;Papa, I can feel you...Papa watch me fly!&#34; The helicopter pans out and you see the ship moving toward America, her new life, and you just know she's going to make it ! I highly recommend it.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Used with: keyboard/mouse combo, XBOX controller, Logitech G27 wheel.<br />Have not tried it with: USB storage, external HDD's.<br /><br />1. No lag... Or at least no difference in lag between straight USB or this extension connection;<br />2. Seems very durable yet flexible;<br />3. Female end seems a bit tight - I'm still not sure if it's a CON or PRO;<br /><br />Overall, a nice extension.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Dredd is a fairly straight forward movie. If you are a fan of comic book movies, action, crime, police, and you don't mind seeing violence, you'll love this movie! Let's hope we see a sequel.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|My review from Season 2 holds strong for Season 3.... I don’t know if I can even describe how much I like Fringe. The level of creativity just keeps getting better. The show would be hard to follow if you didn’t see every episode, which is why I highly recommend buying the series on DVD. Then you can watch each episode and watch the recap if necessary. Its amazing, just buy it!!!
0385535139|3.0|I purchased this book for very little money, but it did state that the book was new.  It is not.  The seller said the book's cover had a slight tear at the top but that is the only flaw the &#34;new&#34; book had.  It is clear this book has been read...not a big deal, but if I wanted used, I would have purchased used.
B001CQONKY|5.0|You never know what your going to see when you watch CSI!! I love this show and have watched every season that is out on DVD. Just buy them!!
0385535147|5.0|My purchased arrived promptly and was packaged well.<br />I love the book, I'd highly recommend it.  I real pager turner.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I look forward to each season more and more!!! Bones is a great show and they just keep adding more detail  to the characters and their lives. I love it!!  BUY IT!
B0046ECFRM|4.0|Ok so I'm going to start with the negatives....1) it was very frustrating having to wait until the very end for what I wanted! 2) sometimes the book would drag on a bit. Positives:  1) soooo worth waiting until the end!!! 2) the adorable factor and whit was at its finest! WOULD RECOMMEND!
B003L77GG0|5.0|I was a fan of Smallville from the first day, they picked a great actor to play Superman!! The show really shows you the trials Clark went through as a kid, then a teenager and young adult. It’s a great series, Ive watched it several times!!!
B007704HO6|5.0|A very encouraging story of a man's determination to break the hold of drugs. The arrival of Bob who is in need of care really helps the author overcome many obstacles he never though he would overcome which in turn helped him totally break the hold drugs had over him. I found it very touching indeed that the author did not want to take the cat with him when he had to go and get his medication. A book every animal lover will love reading
B009GXHOW4|1.0|This app would be amazing if it worked. I can not get it to work if it does. There is no directions or help bar for you. How does this app work?
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Bouncy, ethereal, uplifting song. Haven't quite decided to buy the album yet, but we'll see. But, now the song is in my head again, so that's good.

B0083DJWGO|5.0|This book should be mandatory reading for every thinking person in civilization.  I suspect that this one will be in print forty years from now and be as vital as ever.  The best book I've read in decades.  Nassim Taleb is a thinker of the first order, and encourages all of us to reflect on the world through the eyes of ancient and antifragile wisdom.  We could do worse than read and reread this book.
B00005TQKQ|2.0|I dont know why, i follow exactly the instructions but when I playback my videos the image was worse than before....
1419701533|5.0|My 1st grader wanted this series because his 4th grade friend had it.  Because my son is an avid reader, I decided to purchase the series.  There is some humor that is a little sarcastic that is geared to an older reader.
B0058BI896|5.0|Nothing makes me laugh more than Sheldon and Penny.  I love The Big Bang.  I can watch all day long.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great collection of all 6 Rocky movies (even though I don't care for #5), and a bonus disc with some good features. The price was great and ot seemed to go on sale quite often, which makes the collection even better.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I didn't start watching The Big Band when it started.  A friend talked me into watching and now I can't get enough.  I laugh  and laugh, and laugh.
B008VBYN80|3.0|I like playing these kind of games until they start trying to squeeze cash out of me.  So far, so good with this one.Oki
B00004U2GH|4.0|I gave this a four star rating only because I think his Live at Folsom Prison is a little better than this recording.It is great to hear his music as well as his banter with the inmates.It is a must buy for any Johnny Cash Fan either long time or new listener.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but would have loved to go back to watch again but Amazon only gives 48 hrs to watch digital movies. I think one should be able to access it for at least a week.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|having a horse is cool! the tasks are a bit time consuming, and when you let it sit for a long time the health and care degrades, but otherwise an awesome app
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Was the best book of the hunger game series and any book that I have ever read in my life
1476712042|5.0|In this contemporary read, Jamie Mcguire introduces a mixture of family, young adult and real-life excesses; bringing readers a mass of mixed emotions.<br /><br />I read Beautiful Disaster somewhere around October of last year; it was recommended by Jessica of Books-Cupcakes, and after checking out the reviews and details of the books, I decided to get it.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is running from a past; she is determined to stay away from trouble at all cost; something not so easily done, when you are in a college full of gossips and especially one with Travis Maddox, a man who is in every way the definition of \\"trouble\\". They both meet under unusual circumstances, and Abbey finds herself entangled with the one man she wants nothing to do with.<br /><br />When I first looked up this book, there was one review that noted the excessive language that was used-this almost made me change my mind about buying the book- but in my opinion, I find it not to be as bad as many make it out to be (it wasn't like there was *bleep asdfjkl *bleep asdfjkl *bleep in every sentence).<br /><br />The characters and a 5/5 rating!<br /><br />I do not have much to say about the characters, but how realistic they are. From Abbey, Travis, to their friends, they all have traits and realistic personal issues, in which the average young adult can relate too; but, there were a few times during the read, where I did find the drama somewhat extreme.<br /><br />Many people tend to stay away from issues that are dark and most personal, but I like that Jamie Mcguire, in a way, embraces it in her novel. I mean Travis is messed up-he's short tempered and acts solely upon his emotions (physically and verbally), rather than thinking things through and taking action calmly. Most people would never admit to their shortages and imperfections, because they are afraid of being cast \\"insane\\" or \\"not normal\\" (okay, now I am starting to sound like a character from a cheesy movie and a self-help book).<br /><br />In Abbey's case, after have reading the synopsis, I thought she was going to be one of those characters' that are too good, but I like how her character came to be; she steers away from trouble, but she doesn't take too much caution of everything-which probably would have changed my rating and opinion of the story.<br /><br />I honestly was going to rate this a 4/5 because I was not as content with the ending as I thought I would be the first round, yet, after going through it a couple times, I would not have change the ending in any way.<br /><br />Would I recommend it?<br /><br />Definitely, because it is one of the best reads I have read in 2012. Go check it out, if you have not already!<br /><br />I am waiting on Walking Disaster!/>In Abbey's case, after have reading the synopsis, I thought she was going to be one of those characters' that are too good, but I like how her character came to be; she steers away from trouble, but she doesn't take too much caution of everything-which probably would have changed my rating and opinion of the story.<br /><br />I honestly was going to rate this a 4/5 because I was not as content with the ending as I thought I would be the first round, yet, after going through it a couple times, I would not have change the ending in any way.<br /><br />Would I recommend it?<br /><br />Definitely, because it is one of the best reads I have read in 2012.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I did not think that I would enjoy this game,  but I was very pleasantly<br /><br />surprised. There should be a warning that tells you that it is addictive.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|came in the next day no marks or anything plays great im complely happy with it thanks will be ordering more soon (:
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I'm just not really into these type of games, but I got farther than usual. The art is nice and the puzzles are ok, just not my cup of tea.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great for anyone who loves horses and is looking for a fun game to play! If you get this app you won't regret it but just in case it's free!!!
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I've always heard that these are classics and two of the best games ever made, but I just couldn't get into them. The art/style is very good, but the game play is kind of lacking. May be more of a nostalgic experience.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|The author includes several exercises for each muscle group that anyone can use anywhere.  You can follow his exercise plans or you create one that works for you.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|Not the app for me. I tried it out, but didn't really care for it. Other people may like it, but not I.
B009TSA6YE|2.0|There is nothing more annoying than watching a performance edited by people who obviously don't know their product, for whatever reason was chosen, the quick 80' style \\"music video\\" editing techniques where employed which often took the eyes away from the action...Micheal's playing. These techniques or so passe as to make watching this a frustrating exercises ...who cares what the drummer or keyboardist is doing during a climatic solo, we want to see Schenker's playing!. The sound quality is great and for sure this is must for Schenker fans, but some day I hope to watch a performance that justifies the genius of a performer.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|I love the movie and finally took the time to read the book. This was a very well written book and was definitely worth reading. It's very similar to the movie in terms of content and style, but you get to see what parts the movie cut out. Very cool.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|would recommend this book for all the romantics at heart.....pulls you in  to the story and hard to put down

1400052181|5.0|This book came in perfect condition at a used price.  Was shipped quickly and overall was a great deal.  This is a great (yet sad) story that makes you think about ethics in the field of science and medicine.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|It's kind of like a Super Mario type game. The graphics are kind of cheesy and the controls are not very good.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Better than the news, better than games, even than a book. The best read to start the day and to end the day. No to mention all the .translations in so many different languages.

B004GJDQT8|3.0|The app works well enough as described, but I find that I don't really use it that often. For the times when I do shop on Amazon with my phone, the website works well enough.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very interesting book.  I am going to re-read this again and again because of a very different take on life.  We are all put here for some reason and we need to be on our toes constantly to find out what our mission is
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Not a bad book, but kind of a worn concept (see Battle Royal). I read the whole book, but lost all interest in the story at the ending. Didn't even bother reading the rest of the trilogy.

B0085YNML2|3.0|I don't know. The app starts off great, but I just lost interest. I like the art and style, but not so much the game play. It's worth trying though.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i rate a 4 due to awesome game and awesome updates comin up but it needs stuff like caves mineshafts villages village people minecars and rail also a bonus chest to start out with otherswise im happy to have this for the kindle

B004V5A7K8|2.0|Kind of thought this would be like the old BlackBerry game and it is, but it's just not quite the same experience.
0307346617|5.0|If you love your zombies, and are eager for the release of the movie in June I highly suggest this book.  So much information is in the book that you know they will leave out of the movie so I suggest read it.  Its so very good and well written.  A high must read.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|i got to level 28 then it reset and erased my zoo. i thought it was a fluke so i played again. after i got pass level 28 i thought ok so i spent money on peanuts. then just before level 31 it did it again.  you can imagine my frustration.  the game is really fun. i really enjoy playing but I won't  play again if it erases my zoo again and i won't be wasting my money either
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy, readable and funny! Chick-lit. of the good kind. The main charachters are a bit two dimensional, but not worse than you can expect from this kind of novels. I enjoyed it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoy good war stories and this one gave a good discription of airmans feelings<br />I recomended to my friends

B004I2K4E8|5.0|For theater lovers, this is one of the great ones.  Well lit, beautiful colors, and bright performances, makes this a great production that will stay with you.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Best Batman movie ever... Well after the dark knight and that's only because of Heath ledger. I was hoping that since I bought it off Amazon I would also be able to stream it from my Amazon app.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a well done moving, with intertwining characters that engage with one another yet their storylines do not intersect.  With that premise, it is well orchestrated, and well acted with the right touch of humor.  This should be added to the annual list of Christmas movies to watch during the Holiday Season.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I absolutely love this backpack for my cameras.  I was looking for one that would hold both my Canon and all it's lenses as well as my camcorder.  This was it!  It is very well padded and has extra storage space for other items.  I feel that all my cameras and accessories are well protected.  I would fully recommend this item!  Great price!  I was leery when I placed the order.  Not sure why as everything that I have bought from Amazon has been great!  Thanks guys!!
B0000068BZ|5.0|Always smooth Errol Flynn gives the tale of Robin Hood the right touch of humor with galantry.  Of all the tellings of Robin Hood, this is a classic that never fails to please.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I get wrapped up in this game, it is just so much fun.  Time goes by very fast.  Try it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The mark of a great television series is when you care about the characters lives, whether you like them or not.  Downtown Abbey delivers from the very first episode.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app! I have tried a bunch of apps like this and this one is one of the best....being free today makes it that much better! The audio quality is crystal clear!

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've been a fan of Tom Clancy's for years. This novel keeps you on the edge of your seat. I do't know who's advising him but he's got the technology down cold!
0802473156|5.0|It's obvious now but not before you read it. I'm a guy and I've been married and divorced, and had a couple of other meaningful relationships. He writes kind of cheesy but I'd say this is a must read, plus it's short for all you men out there. Either way, it's jhalf the price of a dinner and it's a much greater investment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and addicting! Love it a lot, easy to work, helps you along the way, gives you instructions. Great download and game!
B008XG1X18|5.0|so many idea's and simple idea's with things just laying around the house.  Great food, workouts, and great for new picture ideas.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. you will too if you are an animal lover in any way. I one hundred percent recommend this game

B006LSZECO|2.0|Actually skipped over last half of book. Felt the relationship was not very believable. Disappointed after seeing it was considered such a great book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Watching season2 is like inviting old friends back into you home.  I Absolutely loved it.  I can't wait to see season 3.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood can do no wrong in my opinion but this is really a special CD  Track 2 and 3 are my favorite.  Two Black Cadillacs and Blown Away are just amazing songs and worth the price for just those, the other songs are a bonus after that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The novel is incredibly well writren. It is funny, charming and engaging. After a few pages free sample, I became convinced that I must read how it will go for these persons. The plot thereafter was consistent withe this good beginning, omend often surprising. What was now going to happen? It was difficult not to be involved in the persons in the novel. I was sad when the book was finished.
B0086700CM|1.0|This game is just horrible on the kindle fire.It doesn't want to tilt or jump up for coins.Maybe its my kindle.Hope someone else has better luck
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Makes you realize how amazing everything in your life is, and everything happens for a reason. This book was AMAZING I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. I would reccommend it for people who have time to spare, due to the fact you won't want to put it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I finally saw the movie Hunger Games (I didn't want to see it - my daughter convinced me it was good) at the end of the movie I couldn't wait to find out what happened next so I bought the book for my Kindle App. I was done with the book within days and now I'm ready for Mockingjay, but I have to wait until spring break :( I love having the book on my Kindle App because I can read it from literally anywhere without a book light and cramping of my hands from holding the book pages open! I hope the movie they release is just as gripping- I couldn't put it down!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|The color makes it easy to see when a lot of other tech things are black.  The built-in tripod helps hold the Kindle in place when sitting and the back helps when I am reading the Kindle in bed.  And the price was right in comparison with other covers.  I've used it frequently as I have been recovering from surgery and spending a lot of down time.  It still seems as sturdy as it was the day I got it.  I like it.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much and can see an improvement in my health by putting some of the recommendations into practice.

B00364K6YW|5.0|Such a wonderful movie and I'm so happy to finally have it available on DVD.  Much better than all those VHS/ancient tapes around.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|no complains with delievery. the product however the story is not the same as the previous evagelion movies that i am used to
B0085TKAW6|2.0|I love all the other Ken Follett books especially Pillars of the Earth & World Without End.  Those 2 were 'un-put-downable' and I didn't want them to end.  Although I liked Winter of the World betterthan book 1 Fall of Giants I still found  hard to read.  I loved the history and it was well researched but the characters were not well drawn and I found it hard to associate them with their respective countries.  I had to keep going backwards to find the relationships between people as well. I was so looking forward to reading this trilogy but my expectations were not met.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I love this series. The product came in time no problems with that. Walking dead in general you can't go wrong with watching it

B00A9C3RB8|1.0|reallly boring to watch but for Streep and Jones. The plot is familiar but the movie is not entertaining at all!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is awesome if it was rate R it could be more funnier. Pitch perfect is in my top 10 funny movies. You could watch this movie on you tube for FREE
0060594896|5.0|I love reading books and this one, I had to stop every few pages to absorb the info in each page. This is a thick book, however the pages are so filled with great stuff. Jack is no joke............... Buy it
B005LAIISA|4.0|The movie description and DVD cover indicate that our beloved Scrat will have a bigger role in this movie. Unfortunately that is not the case. In my opinion, the few scenes involving Scrat are the funniest and most memorable scenes in this movie!<br /><br />I'm sure small children will enjoy the whole movie, but as an adult - I Need More Scrat!!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|honestly, i dont think theres a better headphone out there for $260.<br />though it is neutral, so if you like pumping bass, look somewhere else, but if bass volume isnt the main concern, but rather moving bass, this is way more moving than beats or any other bass heavy headphnes, they are \\"fast\\" meaning something my drums rather than gradually coming in and ending its more like a switch, like tonguing on an instrument, so you get the awesome feeling of heavy music without destroying the mids, and with the treble being equivalent in volume to bass and mids, so if you have a bright (more treble than mids or bass) amp or dac, you the amp / dac is low quality, the treble could sound a bit harsh, however with a warm amp, lower quality music (as long as its mastered to not have white / colored noise) will sound great.<br /><br />comparing these to my last cans, the V-Moda Crossface LP-2 (version 1) for $200 msrp or $140 on amazon atm, i must say the extra $100 is MORE than worth it, these are beautiful for all music in my opinion, the may not scale perfectly with electronic music or other more popular music without sound stage and a lot of instruments, but they're only $250<br /><br />for build quality, the elastic bands wont break any time soon, akg isnt stupid, elastic only breaks when you over stretch it, ive had hair bands last a year without breaking until i stretch it just a little too far and it snaps, but the elastic bands on these cant over extend unless you make them, the only real build quality problem here is the clear plastic part that holds the headband in line, which isnt even necessary, its been an entire year, and now its just got these faint white lines (like when you bend plastic) running through them, i can see them lasting another 2 years without interference, but i taped them anyways to reduce stress, once it breaks ill simply remove them all together.<br />I've also heard before than the 2 bands above the leather strap are cheap plastic, on the contrary, they are solid metal with a plastic shell, these are not a build quality concern, one is right channel audio, the other is ground.<br /><br />If your sound goes out in one can, simply remove the center plastic grill, i used a stable (stick 2 staples in, one on each side of the same grill, both prongs in) and turn counter clockwise, this will remove the cap, and you'll see one of the lines has broken off, simply solder it back and its as good as new, as long as you dont make a huge mess, akg wont even be able to tell you did it, i recommend a long thin soldering attachment, and any solder you can get, have a friend hold the headphones, and the cable, while you solder it. simple fix. (note that this wont happen to everyone)<br /><br />the cable! I LOVE THIS CABLE MAN, LOOOOVE, it may seem cheap, but as long as you take care of it, it wont break from use, be weary of running over it with a rolling chair or squishing it in drawers, ive done both plenty of times, ive got a few flat spots on the cable, but nothing too bad. why is this cable so good? its very bendy, and the part where the connector turns to the cable, the rings, most people probably dont know what those are for, its not too obvious on most cables, because they're cheap, but this ones rings make it more obvious, it prevents the cable from making too sharp of a bend, and because the cable isnt horribly stiff, but the rings are moderately stiff, and go an entire inch into the cable, the cable doesnt make any sharp turns, and so it will last much longer!<br /><br />also, if you only use MP3's, dont bother, the quality of sound wont scale as well, id go for a lower tier pait like the k142strary, they are solid metal with a plastic shell, these are not a build quality concern, one is right channel audio, the other is ground.<br /><br />If your sound goes out in one can, simply remove the center plastic grill, i used a stable (stick 2 staples in, one on each side of the same grill, both prongs in) and turn counter clockwise, this will remove the cap, and you'll see one of the lines has broken off, simply solder it back and its as good as new, as long as you dont make a huge mess, akg wont even be able to tell you did it, i recommend a long thin soldering attachment, and any solder you can get, have a friend hold the headphones, and the cable, while you solder it. simple fix.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never written a review for a book before.  Desperate for something new to read recently and tired of the same old overplayed, hackneyed, boring authors (no offense to them, I'm sure) I started browsing around the internet looking for something NEW.  Something CAPTIVATING.  Something that would give me that old feeling of \\"what the hell just happened?!\\"...I cannot tell you HOW I landed on this book, but I can tell you that I read the Kindle sample of Wool on my computer, and immediately purchased the Omnibus version for a bargain of 5.99 and read the whole thing in four days...thusly neglecting my children, my household duties, my laundry, and probably my personal hygiene in the process.<br /><br />So awed was I by the way this story played out that for the last four nights I have given a synopsis of what I have read to my family in full hand waving, eye widening, glorious detail.<br /><br />So impressed was I by the writing of this book, and how truly excellent it was that I have so far purchased two more kindle copies and emailed them to my friends...and I have written several more asking them if they would like to try it as well.  I would buy ten copies of this book and give them out if necessary.<br /><br />It's that good, people.<br /><br />I'm not one for reviews and I'm not one to give big hints as to story or plot line (except to my family of NON READERS who prefer MOVIES or my stories at dinner time haha)but this movie has the thrill of a classic that resonates so deeply in me that i cannot wait to read more from this author.<br /><br />I'm a little scared of the idea of a movie...BUT whatever keeps this author's bread buttered so that more stories can be written...maybe it won't be a total Hollywood fail.<br /><br />Overall, I would like to say thank you to this author for publishing such an excellent piece of fiction and filling this stay at home mom's days with the excitement and blood tingling thrill of a world so unlike her own.  I'm sure there are some in my line of work (haha) that prefer the whips and chains and far fetched, and fantastical sexcapades of the 50 Shades of Grey ilk...but to me this was far more exciting, exhilarating, not mention believeable.<br /><br />((sorry for any typographical errors in this review, my keyboard is covered in Oreo cookies from my three year old sitting next to me))
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|The plot line is too simple the heroes are not sympathetic characters and the same smarmy female archetype is used.
B009HELT3C|2.0|This was a disappointment. The only good part is the ending. Acting is just above mediocre, foul language comes around a number of times. Not recommended.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Tried several times to register with THE MAIL and could not. Did not realize person was living 'on the OTHER side of the pond'. Is this an Amazon problem, NO. Just be aware you WON'T be able to register, if you like to comment on some of thr articles ....

B0098466CK|5.0|the sword rocks. i have 4 or 5 albums from these guys and this one is one of the better ones. the lyrics are solid and sometimes far out. the guitar sound is right where it needs to be . one of the best bands that i've heard in a very long time. these guys rock!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Since being introduced by CBS's 2 TV segments on him, I love his words and music. So happy to add to my listening collection.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|I don't know what movie these other people watched because I wasn't creeped out or scared in any way during 90% of the movie.  In fact, even saying that is a misconception because nothing happens that would even classify as an attempt at scary or creepy.  But during the last 10%, they at least tried a little bit.<br />Basically this movie is about whether a young teenage woman can build a relationship with a young teenage man... period.  Not until at the end, FINALLY, does something happen that in any way could classify as \\"creepy\\".  So for about an hour this is nothing more than a teenage angst romantic drama.<br /><br />If you're looking for a horror movie do not waste your time; unless you're on some kind of mission to see every movie with Elizabeth Shue or Jennifer Lawrence - because that's the only thing this has going for it.
B00005LK94|5.0|Got this to watch with our grandchildren. They loved it! Then watched with my cousins kids. Great Wholesome movie. Good story line.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun low stress game. I love the music too. I also enjoy that each level starts out easy and then gets more difficult. Love this game.
B009DJB8I2|3.0|My case also had a hole smashed in it, and the little nubs that hold the CD's in place were all broken too. The discs had minor scratches, but all are playable.
B0098460O4|5.0|Every song in the album is gold. Their version of Ave Maria is perhaps the best that I've ever heard. Jonathan Antoine, in particular, is frighteningly good. But just as other buyers have noted, the sound engineering is disappointing. I was hoping to really \\"feel\\" the full strength of Jonathan's voice, but his voice was softened in this album.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|i have never heard of this movie until my husband said my son kept asking for it for christmas. se we decided to get it for him, and he literally watched it everyday for a week strait after he opened it. lol

B00A80SHFM|5.0|I bought this to relive the movie over & over at home!  I wish it had a few more of the songs from the movie, but then it would have to have the whole movie recording on cd for me to be completely thrilled!

B0053TMP24|5.0|Loved it! I read all kinds of fantasy and fiction, they're my favorite genre! This series is definitely up there on my top ten list with Twilight, Hunger Games, and Eragon.
B007P3Q95K|5.0|Richard II<br />Five Stars (and then some)<br /><br />This adaptation was very well acted, filmed, and staged. In fact, Ben Whishaw is now my new favourite actor -- I'd seen him before in Bright Star and Brideshead Revisited and he was good; seeing him in Shakespeare, however, is nothing short of a treat.<br />The cuts in this production were few and made with much more skill than in the other plays. Every actor delivered his lines with feeling and understanding, and the physical acting was well-suited to the words. At times the acting went a bit overboard, but only when Shakespeare's language or the story being told goes overboard (the surrendering scene, with the looking-glass and the crown, featured a deposed Richard rolling around on the floor).<br />The filming, costumes and sets were gorgeous, which only made the great acting and Shakespeare's beautiful writing shine all the more.<br />Parallels with Christ and St. Sebastian were perhaps belaboured a bit much visually, but this is the only flaw, and a small one at that. Belabouring the parallel is in itself all right, but it did start to get old.<br />Many small cuts were made, but these were skilfully done and nothing was cut that would change the story.<br />There was one small change to the plot. They replaced Exton at the end of the play with Aumerle. Surprisingly, it worked.<br />Also, Henry Percy was left out entirely; this was somewhat disappointing, but since he figures largely in 1 Henry IV and these productions imply that many years pass between the two plays, it would be very difficult to rectify the time if Percy was not cut.<br /><br />Henry IV (both parts)<br />Four Stars<br /><br />These two were good. They suffered from some cuts (The King's whining about not being able to go to the Holy Land was neatly snipped out, for example) but were well acted, well filmed and overall a good pair of movies.<br />I wasn't very impressed, but then I'm not very impressed with these two plays on paper; I don'tthink I'll ever come to like Falstaff and Pistol no matter who plays them. I like Shakespeare for the beautiful writing and the in-depth character studies and the complex political intrigue and the elaborate punning insults. I'm not much a fan of fat jokes and pee jokes and plots which revolve around a bunch of thugs getting drunk and robbing each other;, but this is what a good portion of Henry IV is comprised of.<br />Despite this, however, this was a good version of these plays. It had some superb acting, especially Jeremy Irons as The King and Joe Armstrong as Henry Percy.<br /><br />Henry V<br />Four Stars<br /><br />Overall, it was good, but it was lacking in some ways. Tom Hiddleston as Henry is good, though I have seen better.<br />A few of the cuts (uncut Shakespeare is too much to expect from any film adaptation) made a good deal of sense (\\"no king of England if not king of France\\" was divorced from its rhyming couplet, making it actually more meaningful [especially considering that Hiddleston sort of gnawed on and pronounced as ditties the rhyming couplets elsewhere in the play]), a few were disappointing simply because I wanted to see something which they cut out (the whole scene with the traitors, the French bragging about their armour and horses), and some just made no sense (boys and luggage).<br /><br />Most of the comic relief was lopped out of the play; this works, but it changes the overall tone to something more sombre. Gower, Macmorris and, Jamy were entirely omitted, and Fluellen's part was reduced to \\"Captain with Welsh accent\\"; no lengthy rambles about Romans, and no lines beginning with things like \\"do you think that therefore it is meet\\" and no \\"Alexander the Pig\\", and no amusing lists of synonyms.<br />No leek-whacking scene, either -- like the Branagh adaptation, Pistol breaks down part way though the battle, so we also miss the \\"fir and ferret and firk\\" scene.<br /><br />And they cut out the whole thing with the boys and the luggage butleft in the order to kill the French prisoners. It's cause and effect, if you want to cut the cause, you have to either cut the effect or substitute a different cause.<br />Hiddleston gets a KHAAAAN moment and shouts up at the sky \\"I was not angry since I came to France until this instant!\\" for seemingly no reason at all. Actually, this is the only cut that really made no sense; the rest were only a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Also, Henry's tendency to attribute everything to God was neatly pared down, presumably to make it more palatable to a non-religious audience. It wasn't entirely omitted, though, which, as someone capable of seeing a play the way the original audience saw it, I appreciate.<br /><br />Hiddleston's Henry is mostly a personable and affable king; the St. Crispin's Day and \\"Once more unto the breach\\" speeches were believable and the wooing of Katharine was sufficiently awkward (though it was heavily trimmed, notably the \\"have my babies\\" bit). Unlike Branagh (who conveys an exuberant braggadocio tempered by a cold unfeeling) and Olivier (who spends the entire movie posing and being a grand and exalted king), Hiddleston gives the character a full range of human emotion, the subdued fire of the tennis balls scene was quite good.<br />Occasionally he's too obviously reading lines of a play (rhyming couplets, hello), but mostly what we have is a good actor doing a convincing job of being King Harry the Fift.

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Being a fan of Seth Macfarlane, I pretty much knew what to expect from this movie going in and believe me I wasn't disappointed.  Ted is not only hilarious, it's also very sweet which was a surprise.  The underlying themes of love and enduring friendship were coated with a heavy dose of the shock humor Macfarlane is famous for but this movie works in a way only he could pull off.  A guest appearance by Flash Gordon didn't hurt either, this movie is funny as h*ll and not afraid to show it.  I'd totally recommend it.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This is more like a heavily stylized stage play than a conventional film. The performances are all ratherly deliberatly deadpan, the dialogue is all very unnatural and the plot is one long series of small encounters after another. Cut down appropriately, it might actually be better as a play than a film.<br /><br />There is endless repetitive empty dialogue babbling about techology and money all with the spectre of \\"the revolution\\" lurking in the background. It gives the impression of being deep, but its all profoundly shallow. No particular insights are offered other than sort of a mindless heavy-handed tantrum against all modern life. When it runs out of empty words, the film is carried to a conclusion through violence. It doesn't even really end. It just ceases.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti gives by far the best performance in the film in whats probably the key role. It almost reminds me of \\"heart of darkness\\" in terms of plot played out in New York. Heart of Darkness usually fails as Drama because nobody can live up to being \\"Kurtz\\" toward the end. The film gets that part kind of right, but everything else wrong.<br /><br />The film is all style but no substance. All the characters are one-dimensional sockpuppets. It was interesting to watch because it was so unconventional, but its not a good film in any sense.<br /><br />One final note. The extras for this film are extremely interesting. There is a very long \\"making of\\" documentary that in some ways is better than the film itself. If its watched carefully, you can sort of figure out why the film turned out the way it did.<br /><br />The best bit of irony is listening to the director talk about the \\"dehumanizing\\" nature of technology as a theme in the film in terms of wall street. But he doesn't see how he himself has dehumanized the whole film process from treating his actors like machines to shooting his film almost entirely in a green screened digital world .... to trying to direct laying on a couch in his trailer. The process of making Cosmopolis documented here is as strange and dehumanizing as anything to be found on Wall Street or in the world of technology.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is an action movie like they stopped making years ago- full of action, violence, and *gasp* a decent plot.  Karl Urban does massive chin acting in this as a bad a** Dredd that did the character justice and Olivia Thirlby knew what she was doing as the rookie with a usually lovely Lena Headey as a formidable scar toting enemy.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action mixed in with good acting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game. I love the art and the games are thing you do in real life for a horse as well
B0082RHRHC|3.0|I decided to make this year the year of the classics. This was the first one I chose and to be honest, I was disappointed  for there were a lot of sentences that were repeated and many of the names of the towns were missing. However, reading about the trials and triumphs of a young woman and having love win in the end, there is nothing better.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|It may be my age but I found the book totally boring, badly written, and was unable to finish it as I considered it utterly 'HOPELESS'.
B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|\\"Lost in the World\\" is worth the price of the whole album. Intricate and beautiful with a huge all-star cast of backup singers. Listen to it with headphones on... amazing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is such a fun game. I recommend it for any horse lover! Or if it just looking for a fun game.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Babel is more of the same from Mumford & Sons. I loved their Sigh No More, so this one was a real treat for me. &#34;I Will Wait&#34; is a great single.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this album is that they sound like they're in a jam session. When I'm listening, I feel like I'm getting to hear a group of friends who are just enjoying themselves.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Nice app.  Sounds are decent. Will give it a try by my bedside. Loos don't soundtoo noticeable . Much nicer faotp than usual.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|One of my Pandora channels turned me on to Mumford & Sons. Sigh No More is a great first release by a band that will go far if they don't lose their way and decide to change sounds 20 times like, say, Cher.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best track on the disc is After The Storm, but it's a tight race. They're all good. You won't regret this purchase.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|I have never studied physics or science, but it is a passion of mine, and 'A Universe from Nothing' really stoked that passion.<br /><br />If you are looking for a well written book that introduces you to some very interesting concepts of where our universe may have come from (nothing actually) then I would say jump in.<br /><br />It was worth every cent in my opinion.<br /><br />Be warned, it does get a little complicated.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Mr. King does it again, he gets me totally sticked to the book. The story is well told, the characters are finely tailored to the background situation. I recomend it.
055357342X|5.0|Wow. It is incredible to think that after over 900 pages in just the third book the story is still interesting and going strong. There were a number of plot twists in this story and unexpected events. I don't want to say much because I don't want to give away the surprises, but it is clear that Martin is a master storyteller. It is outright impressive that his first three books in the series are this grand in scope and beautifully written. No detail is too small and no angle is too unique for this tale. I want to wait before I start book four and catch up on some other reading because these novels are commitments once you get started, but I doubt I will be able to wait very long. The suspense of what happens to the Stark girls and the continuation of the story is already killing me. Well done GRRM, well done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I only had a problem with the last episode I downloaded.  However, it got over it and I was able to watch.  I will try one more time to make sure I don't have the same problem.  I love watching the show on my Kindle Fire!!!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I loved this book. There was so much action.<br />Now I am on the second book and its so good so far.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This is the show that keeps packing the house in Vegas day after day, year after year.  The biggest problem with this artist is turning the damn thing off so you can get your chores done.  This concert is right up there with Yani and that says something. The new Yani &#34;LIve&#34; concert is by far his best.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This set was a gift to my girlfriend and was the same price as the second season only. Great deal if you love the show.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This concert Cher goes all out and dazzles everyone.  This is a super show and will always be one of my favorites.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|Nice this is available.  Setting it up on different devices is a bit time consuming. Every purchase should be available.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|We weren't expecting much from this sequel, but were pleasantly surprised. It was a fun action flick, not cheesy as we had feared.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Well written excellent character development. I fell in love with Mia and sympathized with her decision.  I will recommend this book to friends.

B00956UPSW|1.0|I keep trying to like these guys but it just isn't happening for me...seems like every song is interchangeable with any other track and after I'm done I couldn't remember anything specific about it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a really good book! Having three daughters of my own the subject was a little touchy for me and I almost didn't finish it. I made it to the end though and I'm glad I did! Definitely a page turner!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing! As descriptive and addicting as Harry Potter! Danger,suspense,love,future,and family all in one! A peek into a futuristic land and its survival at so many levels.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|this case is to house a canon d20 underwater camera.  i like the case for ease of access to the camera, the zippered pouch is perfect for the usb cable and spare battery.  the belt loop is handy for hands free carry.
B005651R24|4.0|This is probably my favourite of John Green's books. It was exactly as funny as it needed to be to balance out the emotion.
B005R32L66|5.0|This is an excellent app to download to utilized for communicators.It should definitely be added to whatever apps you use on a daily basis and consistly.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|This album has all his latest hits and plus more. What is there not to like? Plus your getting an amazing deal when you buy the whole album vs buying a few of his biggest songs separate.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This is an excellent app to download to utilized for documents.It should definitely be added to whatever apps you use on a daily basis and consistly.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Yes it's a bit silly and purely escapism, but this series offers fun and flights of imagination. What if those familiar fairy tale, mythological, and legendary characters were alive and living somewhere in Maine? This isn't great cinema, but many viewers will enjoy the what.if element of each episode.
B0051HNMTI|1.0|This app worked ONE time, now won't launch at all. Save your money, there are other fitness apps out there. Oh, by the way, Amazon won't refund your money for this crap. Nice scam, Amazon!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I would recommend this for Preston/Child fans, especially those familiar with the Pendergast &#34;saga.&#34; Otherwise, I'd give it a miss.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Most of the HOG are just finding things on a single screen. This game has a great story line and the objects for the game is scattering around several screen (places). So to complete the game I have to go back and forth at the correct time to get the correct object to continue. The game is not hard, the hidden objects are not too tough to figure out without reveal too much. I like the parallelism worlds which travel through mirrors. Only one complain is too short a game.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm not a big Steven King fan. I don't even remember why I bought this book, but, I must say, I enjoyed every bit of it. However,  I'm still scratching my head over the ending.
B006LSZECO|4.0|But there's no app for a bourbon Buzz on a warm day in a cool, dark bar.  The world will always want a drink.
B009JBZH54|5.0|You can't go wrong with this blue ray set...any true Batman fan should own it! My son was stoked when he opened it on Christmas!
6300274187|5.0|I just received this movie today and I am currently watching it. Its a childhood movie and classic. I am glad that I ordered it, thank you Amazon! I am very happy with my purchase!
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink is one of a new breed of authors that use quantitative academic research to examine key business issues. To Sell is Human is a fun and interesting and informative read. It is appropriate for all business managers, not just those in sales or sales management, and for students and not-for-profit managers as well.<br />Well-written, fun to read -- and highly recommended.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Here is a cast to die for, playing characters in a home for retired opera singers; they are preparing for their annual celebration of Verdi's birthday. But there is a \\"spanner (wrench) in the works\\" when a former diva arrives, in the person of Maggie Smith. Based on the play by Ronald Harwood and directed by first-timer Dustin Hoffman, this delicious PG-13 comedy bathes us in classical music, witty dialogue and a lovely setting. In fact the opening credits include some of the finest editing I've had the pleasure to enjoy in recent years. Kudos to Barney Pilling for the film editing; Ben Smith for the art direction; and Dustin Hoffman for respecting the music.<br /><br />The world of opera is a relatively small one, so it is no surprise that a few of these divas and divos have a shared \\"history,\\" and therein lies our tale.<br /><br />Let's look at some of this wonderful cast:<br />  * Maggie Smith (\\"Downton Abbey\\") is Jean, who always had at least 12 curtain calls but hasn't been in the spotlight for far too long!<br />  * Michael Gambon (\\"Harry Potter\\") is Cedric, in charge of the star-studded gala, with a towering ego of his own.<br />  * Billy Connolly (\\"Brave\\") is Wilf, proof positive that an old horn dog never quits sniffing around.<br />  * Tom Courtenay (\\"Gambit\\") is Reggie, a kind, considerate fellow who is still nursing a broken heart.<br />  * Pauline Collins (\\"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger\\") is Cissy, the sweet busybody who can't think of one bad thing to say about anyone.<br /><br />Just a couple of important tips: 1) If you have any hearing problems, either see this in a theater that features closed captions, or wait for the DVD with Amazon.com so you can turn on the subtitles. 2) Be sure to stay through the final credits because Mr Hoffman generously included the faces of many of the performers, along with a head shot of that same performer during his or her heyday. What a beautiful finale!<br /><br />BTW: I just received my DVD from Amazon and it DOES have closed captions. Yippee!DOES have closed captions. Yippee!
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I actually liked this movie but the writing wasn't great.  I don't think it deserved all the negative reviews though because the Kutcher and Portman did a really great job.  I mean, had it been other acters, it might have failed pretty hard but they saved it and turned it into a nice film for a night at home with the girlfriend or something. Nothing to write home about, but it tugs at the old heart strings a little bit.<br /><br />Watched it for free on amazon prime so I'm probably being a little generous. If you're a Natalie Portman fan I think you'll like it and Kutcher actually surprised me, he was really good.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The novel would have been more effective as a short story  It was, however, clever and entertaining..  I'll read others.<br /><br />JJ
B002APU580|5.0|Bought this fir my daughter's 18th birthday, along with Jane Austin's collection of books.  Haven't unwrapped it yet.  But we have both watched it...and love it!  I know she'll be surprised and excited when I give it to next month!  Thank you!!!

B0033H7VI6|4.0|I received this knife today and wanted to note a few things:<br /><br />1) It is a very heavy duty knife. (Emphasis on heavy.) It will serve well in the field and will not break down after hard service.<br />2) The knife sheath is heavy and well constructed. The keeper strap took a little time to figure out but works well.<br />3) The knife has a few tiny dings on the back strap of the blade and a couple of slight dings in the blade itself near the tip. I will have to sharpen those out. (Thus, the 4 stars instead of 5.)<br />4) It took over a month for this knife to be shipped and in my hands. (I almost took off a star for that, but I did agree to wait.)<br /><br />I look forward to many years of service for this knife.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I do a lot of online gaming and skyping and while I wanted a cordless headset so that I could move away from my computer and still talking (or listening) I often found my other headsets dead when I needed them and had no choice but to take it off and plug it in to charge.  This headset however solved my problem.  It allows you to still use the headset even while it is plugged in and charging.  This allows me to use it wirelessly as I want, and then plug it in when at the computer for extended use (sometimes 12 hours non-stop!).  It's comfortable, though a little heavy and large feeling at first until you adjust to it.  I do have two &#34;complaints&#34; but both really aren't faults.  The first is...the initial set up of this headset (for people who are picky about their sound quality) can be a touch time consuming as you set it for games, skype, movies, music etc getting it just right.<br /><br />The second concern however is a bit more of a nuisance.  I use a laptop and the dongle that connects to the USB for wireless use is not suited for laptops given it's length.  On a desktop CPU where you are not near your USB ports it would be fine...but on my laptop I have broken and had to replace the dongle twice from it catching on things during movement.  I wish they would make a shorter (mini) dongle available for use with laptops.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I enjoyed the writing style of the author, and can see that he can tell a great story. Sadly, this wasn't it. I felt like the book left a lot to be desired and didn't make sense in the character development.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best ever the first was classic this is epicness keep it coming this game rocks if your a fan of the first then this is a must have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great overhaul of the original Temple Run with added features and customization that still remains faithful to the original gameplay and style of the first.<br /><br />Graphically it has seen an immense upgrade in quality and atmosphere, with surroundings almost being distracting and functioning as an obstacle themselves.<br /><br />Tilting seems to be a little stiffer in responsiveness, and the minutely shifting camera angles along the paths are a minor nuisance.<br /><br />Further inclusion of the extra characters is neat, as well as utilizing their unique abilities in gameplay.<br /><br />I think this is what Temple Run is meant to be.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|it came earlier than expected and in perfect condition. i'm happy  with this product. i will be puchasing more from amazon.
B001NU4CDM|5.0|I love the album. My husband and I really like Styx and I like having it on my computer so I can listen when I want and my husband likes to have music on his MP3 player
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Good book - entertaining and thought provoking.  While the book could be considered a little &#34;slow&#34; at times, I think Oliver did a great job getting you inside the characters heads.  Enjoyed and will look forward to the next installment.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Amazing voice, arrangement, smooth and unusual transitions. Intellectual and stimulating! Not the same old mindless pop stuff. I love it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|It works good on most of my devices.  I have it loaded on  Driod X and Razr Maxx HD and it works great, but it crunches the screen on my old galaxy tab 7.  Overall it works great.
B003L77GH4|5.0|It's an awesome show. I just can't get enough! Once I start watching, I can't stop. It's so suspenseful. I tell everyone about it and have gotten a few people just as hooked as I am.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This movie just stunk! The whole thing took place within one dark building and it really never developed any resemblance of a plot. It was completely forgettable and actually became a chore to make it through until the end. The only upside is that there were no Rob Schneider sightings.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this show! It's not filthy, vulgar, dirty, or anything like that. Granted it does have some love scenes but shoes no nudity, For once, it's not what the series is about. I watch it with my boyfriend almost every night. Even he loves it because it's so suspenseful!
B005CAATXG|5.0|It arrived quickly, it was in perfect condition (brand new) i had no issues with the company or the delivery.  Thanks!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game!<br /><br />Very fun! Although the game occasionally freezes, its only for a little while. Otherwise the graphics were great!
B00005AAFS|5.0|Well, i love the album, but i never got it in the mail.  The customer service was very courteous though, and gave me a prompt refund.
1451627297|5.0|Stephen King's 11/22/63 is another excellent novel written in the distinctive style of an author whose large body of work has earned great respect and love by critics and readers. The writing style is simple and direct, following the guiding principle that King states as just describing to the reader \\"what happens next.\\" The descriptions are complete, scene after scene, and King does not skip over events in his story that would be challenges for less talented writers to describe. This technique produces lengthy novels, and in the case of 11/22/63, King describes it in an afterword as one of his \\"long books.\\"  The novel is comparable in length and reader satisfaction to two of his previous novels, [[ASIN:B0012I8MNQ The Stand By Stephen King]] and [[ASIN:B0052UMLIW Under the Dome by Stephen King]]<br /><br />The story of 11/22/63 is very familiar to those of us who lived through the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on the title date. I was entering the locker room at San Rafael High School in California for gym class on a sunny day when a student told us that President Kennedy had been shot. King sets the stage for the novel in the context of chaos theory in which the smallest of events, like a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world, affects the entire world in unpredictable and potentially significant ways. The assassination of a leader of the free world has an immediate effect and changes everything in the world at the speed of radio and television (no internet then).<br /><br />Jake is a young man born well after the event who is recruited by an older man to travel back in time to try to prevent Kennedy's death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald, a loser and wife abuser whose ugly moth wings flap and change the world forever. The chaos caused by this insignificant little man is evident to those of us who experienced instant life changes. But is only a historic description for Jake until he enters the time portal found by his older friend, Al, a diner owner who is too sick to make the journey. The portal in Al's diner transports Jake the volunteer time traveler in Maine from 2011 back to 1958. His goal is to prevent Oswald from carrying out his cowardly act.<br /><br />Chaos theory describing the interactions of systems that produce specifically unpredictable actions in nature is interesting when looking at the phenomena of the past. Jake, however, finds that when past events are changed, \\"the past is obdurate.\\" Instead of a closed system of reactions with a time traveler's foreknowledge of outcomes proceeding in a single time line with many collateral branches, Jake's behavior causes changes in multiple time lines. Many major \\"strings\\" of events  \\"harmonize\\" the past and present so that each string causes changes in every other string going forward and backward in time. Jake's observations themselves of the effects of his own behavior in trying to stop Oswald actually change the events chaotically as strings of space and time harmonize with overtones and undertones. This relative experience of supposedly real events is well-documented in physics; observing and measuring phenomena fundamentally change event outcomes.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed going back in time via King's wonderful descriptions of late 1950s and early 1960s of the living conditions of my past. It was like a visit to the Smithsonian museums that have displays of historical scenes of life.  Life was a completely different in the USA then with positive and negative aspects, and King writes about them so well. My life path and the paths of everyone else were changed forever on that November Friday. The foundation of an individual's life, love, is the one immutable force, the intersection of all strings of life. I connect the strings of Stephen King's novel to those of one of my favorite novels with similar harmonics from an earlier period, Anthony Powell's [[ASIN:0226677141 A Dance to the Music of Time: FirstMovement]].Movement]].

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Absolutely my favorite tv series! I only subscribed to HBO, because I caught an episode of this on a free weekend they had, and knew I had to see every episode! Love buying the box sets, because you get the extra content discs, and it's fun to see interviews with everyone

B0027MJU00|3.0|You will like it but no love it if you read Gone Girl. It's a little slow, gets better at the end but not my favorite at all.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|OK...the first is always the best...LIked the Brolin playing the younger Jones character.<br />Resolution streaming from Amazon site was definitely not as high definition as I get from<br />Netflix. Movie was certainly entertaining and had fun watching it.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the series...watched many episodes on Netfix. Hated paying extra to get caught up<br />on Amazon...but understand you have to make $ too.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I just started using it, faster than one on tablet when I bought it. I would recommend it to others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless kept me interested. I didn't want to put it down. I liked the wording . I liked the romantic feeling I got reading the story.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|very well put together to keep you coming back for more...just as good as any of those facebook games everyone loves to play
B009JBZH54|4.0|In this package, you get basic features of all three Batman movies. Nothing different from having all 3 movies separately.<br />The feature booklet and hard casing are a nice touch but they are not a deluxe feature either.<br />If you are looking for a die hard collector's edition with all metal tin casing, model figures and other stuff, then you should wait.<br />Still, it's a great way to get all movies at one if you don't have them already.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I discovered  this book not having read the first 2 books from the author. I must say that I was really surprised to love the story so much and I almost couldn t stop reading it. I highly recommend it
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Never heard of the artists until i saw them on America's got Talent...so bought the CD I love it and it is in my car as we speak..<br /><br />Great CD
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|I love this soundtrack and even my children like it. I also own the two disc set conducted by nic raine (and I thought that soundtrack was great but this is better). It is more epic sounding and the instruments stand out better. The singing/chanting is also of a higher grade.
B00AXVIBKW|4.0|It took a few listens but True North has warmed on me. I am one of the fans who felt like New Maps (and moreso Dissent of Man) had too many filler tracks. This album still has a few... but by and large it's a leaner and cleaner experience. The songs are more aggressive, feeling at times like No Control or Against the Grain and at times like the meanest tracks on Grey Race.<br /><br />For BR neophytes, this album is the finest example of a thirty year old  band maintaining relevance by putting out compelling material. Gentle on the ears enough to draw in rock music fans that don't love punk, and with enough social commentary to appease the counter-cultural.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|The basic concept of tilting, twisting a person's device to control the a/c was 'soft' and hard to get it to do what I wanted it to do. Guess I've been away from flying a/c too long. Would have liked to have more exacting control of the device. Basically I turned it off after a couple of 'missions.' Don't have time for imprecise responses.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the first show since Laugh In (60's) that I just won't miss.  Sundays are no longer boring thanks to the Abbey.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this along with Accuwx app to check current conditions at my home. Then I've put in locations that my wife & I like to follow and gloat that we don't have to worry about those temps this morning. Ability to pull up radar is important here since we don't have tornado sirens and can see the bad wx approaching. On original Kindle Fire it freezes up once-in-a-while but on my HD it doesn't. On HD have the ability to see MANY temps from various cities as there are icons indicating which city has a temp available.
0312330537|5.0|When I received this book for Christmas a few years ago, I already knew of the story (I was born & bred in Melbourne, not far from the jail he escaped from) and from page one, I knew it would be difficult to put the book down. Instead of getting up at 6am each day to swim/bike/run, I would get up at 6am, pick up the book and launch into it, day after day after day, until it was done.<br /><br />Greg's writing is so vivid and philosophical, it is easily the best book I have ever read and I'll read it again in the next few years. Looking forward to his follow up.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick read, relatable at any age over 15, and at the end I felt good.

B008EKON56|2.0|I wanted to be able to use a standard USB cable on my iPod and to be able to properly connect my FiiO E5 amp to it. I decided to kill two birds with one stone and purchase this adapter that does both. I was a little hesitant to buy it at first because I have Rockbox installed on my iPod and I wasn't sure if it would be compatible with it or not, but after seeing how cheap the price was, I decided to take the risk.<br /><br />I received it yesterday and so far I'm very happy with it. It fits in the iPod perfectly and stays put, and the build quality is very nice ([EDIT] OR SO I THOUGHT). The first time I connected my FiiO E5 to the line out and pressed play I was just blown away on just how much of an improvement that it made on the sound quality. The bass is tighter and has more depth, the treble was cleaner and more detailed, and it gave me a wider, more refined soundstage than what I was hearing from the built in headphone jack on the iPod. Oh, and all the sound settings and EQ settings (except for volume) are also applied to the line output when you use Rockbox which is what I wanted so that's a plus for me. Then, I tested the USB jack on it and found out that it works exactly the same way as a regular sync cable would.<br /><br />[EDIT] It just broke today. I plugged it into the bottom of my iPod and only the left channel was playing. Then when I went to pull it out, the 30 pin connector came out and stayed behind in the iPod. I decided to open the connector up to see what caused it to break. What I found out was that the 30 pin connecter wasn't embedded into the circuit board like I originally thought, but instead it was just soldered to the board by the pins themselves and the solder joints came loose and it fell right off.<br /><br />I'm disappointed with FiiO now. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with their build quality. Hopefully it's just this model that has this design flaw.<br /><br />I'm gonna try a different LOD model without the USB port and hope it's built better than this one.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I really like the game but the problem is it took three hours to load. I am not sure if the problem is my device (kindle fire) or the game. But overall it is a fun game. :)
B008A708E8|4.0|Always been a huge fan of this classic! It is always an excellent read. I would recommended for young and old alike
B009CGYO0K|5.0|This is probably the best of The Oatmeal's work compiled into a shiny, humorous book. Probably better than &#34;5 Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Nose&#34;

B007712XAU|5.0|My sister and I watched all parts of #1 and #2 and we loved it.  However, we had difficulty with the second disk in Part #2; it seemed like the disc was damaged and we lost some of the drama on Part Seven.  It would be nice to have that disc replaced.<br /><br />As the purchaser of the two programs ($130.00), I was upset that a few days after I purchased the two sets, the price was reduced by something like over $20.00.  I felt I should have received a credit.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Great book! I kind of wish I didn't read it until the third in the trilogy came out so I could jump right in because it leaves you at a total cliffhanger.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I told my friend she loves it a lot<br />I do to we play it all the time also she told her friend!!!!
B009G9Z08S|4.0|Fans of the graphic novel will enjoy this animated movie. It stays very faithful - down<br />to each character's dialogue and little plot details. Surprisingly, omitting Batman's inner dialogue took nothing away - I was expecting to really miss his \\"lucky old man\\" thought tangents but really didn't. The art is amazing. It is Frank Miller's vision, but a tighter/cleaned up version. Part 1 is the entire Mutant Gang storyline. I can't wait to watch part 2..
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Provocative and well written. Very meaningful because the writer is clearly a scientist who did not believe in God or heaven. His unique experience definitely makes one re-think his or her own beliefs.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This App is great! I love the design and the information that the product provides, just easy to read facts about the state of my kindle battery. The down load started to work right away with nice graphics. good tool for planning out my day.
0345803485|5.0|I ordered this book and couldn't put it down.  It is great if your into reading about this kind of stuff.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! It is more challenging than the first with way more boosts n upgrades. This is my favorite game, again!!! U get to fly down zip lines, ride on the tracks, n so much more! The only small issue is tht it doesnt have an exit to get out on my phone. Other than that, its the greatest game, n always has been!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Excellent movie - great acting - I bought it for a gift - having seen it previously<br />enjoyed it greatly. Would recommend it to everyone
B00571F26Y|5.0|Book is well written and researched.  Have eliminated most wheat from my diet, and within about three weeks lost five pounds, placing me below the &#34;overweight&#34; BMI level for the first time in years.  Not worrying fat content  in food is a bit unsettling for someone that has focused on low to no-fat foods for so long. Am interested in seeing how my cholesterol levels shake out when I have a blood test at some point.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, and they don't constantly shove the gems down your throat like some games do. You earn one gem with each level up which will take me forever to save up for a unicorn but will be worth it. If you like horses you will like this app.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I ordered this CD for a birthday gift for my mother and had it shipped to her. It arrived quickly and it good condition. I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend this seller/product. My mother loves it! Happy customer!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm still in the beginning of this book but I wanted to find out what happened on that day from someone that was there.looking back I've thought about what I've read so far and can't wait to continue reading to find out what happens next.if you're looking for a book that would give secrets of the community or other national secret and stories this book is probably not for you but if you're looking for a good account is history and what happened on that day then so far from what I've read I think you'll really enjoy this book.I would also like to give praise and my heart felt thanks for this community that goes far and Beyond for our country and what they sacrifice for our freedom.
0316228532|5.0|I loved the book. After going through the 503 pages I found myself sad that it was over. J.K. Rowling took me to a world unlike my own but inhabited by characters that I could recognise around me. The personalities developed have so many layers that I found it hard not to empathise with all of them at one point, and resent their attitudes at another.<br /><br />And yes, I, too, loved Harry Potter. I consider myself lucky to have grown up with it and that was the reason I welcomed this refreshing and challenging read of Rowling's adult novel. As such, I was surprised to see so many critical reviews. I am well aware that it is a matter of taste, but I still can not comprehend what did the writer put in there to disappoint so many people. The book is as well written as Harry Potter, but it does more to stimulate the spirit of the reader and to improve her understanding of character, motives and behaviour than Harry Potter could have ever done.<br /><br />Bottomline: read The Casual Vacancy if you are a Reader. Avoid it if you only liked reading books for teens and young adults like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Hunger Games or A Song of Ice and Fire (all great books, but to like this one you'd also need a taste for a different genre).
B0060D123K|4.0|Nothing new or surprising in yet another version of A Christmas Carol, but it's fun, and Michael Caine makes a convincing Scrooge.
B008I34XUY|5.0|Frank Zappa was a musical genius. The musicians who played with him went on to play with other greats. Two of his drummers now work with Jeff Beck. I still need to replace more Zappa vinyl. There will never be another Zappa.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|I never thought I'd like this movie, but once I watched it, I fell in love. It's so witty, so charming, so beautiful in sort of a creepy way. Even the songs (which in my opinion are often weak in animated films) are wonderful, especially &#34;What's This?&#34; and &#34;Making Christmas.&#34; Very small children (under age 5) might be frightened in one or two spots (Oogie-Boogie is sort of gross), but other than that, it's a film for the whole family to enjoy any time but especially at Halloween or Christmas.
159562015X|3.0|This is a very good book, which takes you to get insight of yourself in order to improve and obtain the goals you deserve.<br /><br />The only problem is they should advise if you buy a used book like the one I got you won't be able to take the test which is 90% of the book.
0345803493|3.0|Now that I've read the entire series, I have to say the 2nd installation of 50 shades was kind of lacking.  A lot happened, but nothing happened.  I think EL James tried to pack too much action and plot twists in, and the overall story and journey of these two as a couple went no where as a result.  Of course that didn't stop me reading it or the next.  It was my least favorite of the series, but absolutely necessary to read so you can get to the 3rd one- which is GREAT!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This will keep you on the edge of your seat start to finish. I have enjoyed all of Flynn's books and this is right there with the rest.
0345803507|5.0|The 3rd installation of 50 shades was probably my favorite.  While the 2nd book started to drag, this picked up with an action, sex filled plot line with many twists and turns.  Sure we can all say the sex scenes and phrases get repetitive- but it's a romance book.<br />My FAVORITE part of the book is one of the epilogues- &#34;Meet 50 Shades&#34;.  Where you are taken back to the 1st book, and the story of Christian and Anna meeting is re-told through Christian's perspective.  Very cool, eye opening, and truly unique- I haven't seen this in a romance novel before.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What a wonderful way to refresh your history of this period and at the same time enjoy the family trials and tribulations of the characters Folliet weaves into his story. He really has a gift to be able to make fiction and make the reader experience the pain so many had to endure in what was real hisorical events. I am looking forward to book three. The first two were wonderful. If you haven't read &#34;Pillars of The Earth&#34; or &#34;World Without End&#34;, you are missing Ken Folliet at his best.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Functional and practical, an excellent value- most kindle covers are double this price.  This minimalist design has all the basic functions you need.<br />The kindle fire 7\\" snaps perfectly in place, and fits securely.  The outer cover is just enough padding for protection without adding bulk- this is my favorite feature, it fits perfectly in my purse.  I like that it came with a simple elastic band to hold the case shut.  The standing function I would give probably 3 out 5 stars, it stands but you have to really make sure the elastic is secure or it falls down.  Overall an effective product, the price really makes it stand above the rest.
B005DC68NI|3.0|If I had read the first twenty pages or so of this before I self-published my first novel I probably would have done so sooner.  He lays out a good snapshot of the changing face of the publishing industry and explains exactly why self-publishing is a solid business plan these days.<br /><br />However, if I had read the rest of the book, I might never have made the attempt.  In his defense, I am sure that his intent was not to discourage writers, but that's the effect it had on me.  I am sure that the advice he gives is valid, if one happens to be independently wealthy, have plenty of time, and be a natural extrovert.<br /><br />Quite frankly, reading it left me very depressed.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case provides an easy, snap-on fit for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  The &#34;grippability&#34; of the faux leather, somewhat rubberized outer surface has already saved me from dropping the Kindle once.  The &#34;auto on/auto off&#34; feature on opening and closing the case is a nice bonus.  Cosmetically, while laying on a desk or nightstand, the case makes the Kindle look like a small day planner or journal (nice look).  As I have yet to get an external keyboard for the Kindle, I have not really had an opportunity to fully test out the folding stand capability of the case -- other than to simply determine that it works.  There might be some limitation as to the range of angle you can set for the screen using this mode (it seems to prefer a more vertical angle, so that the screen doesn't slide forward), which might be problematic with viewing relative to your line of sight -- but the visibility of the Kindle Fire HD screen is so good up to extreme angles, I'm not sure this will be an issue for anyone either.  All in all, I have been extremely happy with this cover.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Anyone that has been on pinterest knows that this is the most addictive app if you are a craft person.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I was quite curious about the fifty-shades series as they seemed to be so popular. I do enjoy reading the books (now busy with the third book), but I somehow feel very much reminded to the love romances that I used to devour when I was an adolescent. The development of the relation is a bit more challenging in 50 shades and the sex scenes are more explicit and much less mainstream. I also very much enjoy El James's language -- so yes, in some ways this is more than just a Barbara Cartland love story. Still, at times I start feeling &#34;oh no, not again - couldn't we just for once go on with the plot?&#34; when the next sex-scene starts -- only to remember that the plot is actually not all that extraordinary either. Some descriptions are not only beautiful but definitely hot and there is certainly an interesting development in Ana's and Christian's sex life, but not always interesting enough...<br />An other thing that irritates me a bit is the amount of detail for the &#34;Rich man's world&#34; in which Ana is emerged. Although Ana keeps emphasizing that money and all the luxury coming with it is completely unimportant for her ... the way that El James dotes on all details suggests that she does not share her heroines attitude.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I question why anyone would listen to some of the apps, but there is something for everyone. Either way, it's worth the download.

0345529057|5.0|Wonderful books, nice sleeve to keep them all in. Definitely worth the buy if you're into the show, and if you're not, what's wrong with you!? hehe, kidding. But seriously, would highly recommend, especially if you're a fan of anything renaissance, medieval, LotR, sword fighting, or awesome.
0553801473|5.0|Great book, though I wish it were available in paper back, and in the same dimensions as the rest of the books so they looked nice sitting next to eachother. I previously purchased the box set. But its a lengthy read but definitely worth it!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this product to one of my best friend. I bought it as a gift, he is really happy about it and he is recommending this product. He is very pleased about it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Obviously a great movie, looks great with the other two movies as a set. Only complaint is that it doesn't come with the regular version of the movie, only the extended. Which is okay with me cause that's what I wanted, but just wanted to put that out there! Definitely a great buy, a must own collection of movies, and the bonus features are wonderful! It's a total of 4 discs in all.

B005LAIGW8|4.0|How can you go wrong with Nicolas Cage.  As always love him and his acting but the plot just wasn't as good as the first one.  But still worth watching.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It kept my interest for some time, but after a while it was like ok, let's get on with it.  Also, though I know the survival to live was necessary, at times the description of mealtime was a bit much.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|It was one of those movies that you have to watch to the end before it makes sence.  Great acting and great action but the ending is the best.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great speed and a  great product. Exactly what I wanted and needed. Amazon Prime is well worth the yearly fee.

B003YV0A02|4.0|A classic Bruce Willis action movie. Worth the time to watch even though I've seen this movie several times in the past.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not much into young adult fiction, despite having tried one recently, so I was reluctant to try this one. But seeing it ranked #2 on Kindle for best books last year I had to try it and was also motivated by some of the other reviews.  Fortunately, this book does not disappoint.  The characters and story are engaging and riveting.  It's hard to put a smart, witty spin on something as sobering as cancer, but The Fault in Our Stars does just that.  Even though the author claims at the end that she despite her research on cancer, she chose to use or invent as she saw fit.  That surprised me a little, but did not take away from the story and the depth of the characters.  My only complaint would be that Augustus and Hazel seemed much too mature for their age and their intellectual level, humor and conversation seemed a little unrealistic.  But then I know there are some very intelligent youths out there and they are exposed to a lot more knowledge, life experiences, etc. than I was at their age.  So it's plausible.  And more importantly, it kept me engrossed and rooting for them, their love and their lives, despite the all the odds and, as they might say/believe, out of spite over those very odds.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very cute story with lots of laughter, love, and intimacy.  Very well thought out and the characters were well described and relatable.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|A very good book with a great storyline. I definitely recommend this book to other people. 5 stars for awesomeness
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this for me and my granddaughter to play together. it's perfect to show how much work and upkeep go into the care of a horse. The artwork is beautiful and the sounds are authentic. I attempted to earn more coins but was directed to sites that asked for personal info so I'll just try to get them on the game. This is fun for horse lovers.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it this is the best game in world i played this game so much i became 1st in the world
B0051T47NQ|4.0|Being a Norwegian  It was great being able to get a movie in that language.  Good thing there is the<br />subtitles in just in case.  I probably would purchase more if available.
0765325950|5.0|I have read every one of Richard Jordan/Brandon Sanderson's books and I have loved most of them.  Some can be wordy and make you dizzy reading them.  I found the ending to be a bit anticlimactic.  I felt like I was missing something.  Won't spoil the book for those who haven't read it yet.
034580404X|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my daughter in USA. She is an avid reader and she loved the gift.
B0002YJ29O|5.0|The DVD starts maybe a touch slow but boy are you in for a ride after a while! This is such an enjoyable DVD, particularly the end with eight pianists playing sublimely in synchronism it blows your mind. What a fantastic way to show how much fun the piano can be!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you have ever wanted a horse, you will love this app. This game gives you most of the benefits of having a horse(You can't actually ride it or touch it). But without all of the problems associated with owning a horse(The space needed, the expense, not to mention the smell of cleaning up after it). You can really enjoy \\"My Horse\\".<br />For those of you who are more into Fantasy than the more traditional animals. \\"My Horse\\" has you covered. It has Unicorns and a Zebra. Not to mention the perfect backdrop for them as well.
B007REV4T8|2.0|A major disappointment--Craig continues to be miscast and charmless as 007; Bardem overacts outrageously, coming across as eccentric rather than menacing; Finney TOTALLY wasted near the end in a nothing role.  Fiennes workmanlike as Mallory; Dench again outstanding as M--this is her film; she saves the film from total vapidity--she will be so difficult to replace.  Brosnan or Clive Owen would have been far superior as 007--'Bond girls' totally forgettable--make no impression whatsoever.  AND I have seen EVERY 007 film ever released!<br />Rank the BOND actors:<br />1.CONNERY<br />2.Lazenby<br />3.Brosnan<br />4.Moore<br />5.Dalton<br />6.Craig

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played many g5 games but I must say this one is very interesting.  l like the story line and the graphics are very good. I would recommend this game to anyone. It plays very well on my kindle fire. Good job. Can't wait for the next one.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I liked this OK as a baseball movie. Eastwood was good. The biggest problem with the movie was the romance angle. It felt forced and fake like the producers said, &#34;Gee we got baseball, we got Eastwood, that will bring in the guys, but we need something to bring in the 18-34 year-old female demographic. I know lets throw in Justin Timberlake to give the daughter a love interest. Women love that kind of stuff. Never mind it doesn't really have much to do with the story, we'll throw it in anyway.&#34;<br />Like I said it's medicre as a baseball movie.
1439153663|2.0|My book club really liked this book but I just couldn't get into.  I never finished reading it.  Just couldn't get through it.  So many other good books to read.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|The plot is kind of silly, but it has cool aliens, big guns and lots of things that go boom. Pretty much all you can ask from this kind of movie.
1439102813|5.0|Loved this book.  Learned a lot about a subject I was not that familiar with.  I would recommend this to others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I will tell you up front that I am a very picky reader. If I'm not totally hooked in the first couple chapters, I have a hard time finishing. So, just letting you know, I'm not that easily impressed.<br /><br />And I just couldn't put this book down! :)<br /><br />I purchased 'Hopeless' right after Christmas, for a much-needed break from holiday stress. Little did I know I would be swept up in this breathless, emotional roller coaster of a story, so much so, I read it in two sittings (and not one, only because I'd been reading all day and my eyes wouldn't stay open anymore! :P)<br /><br />It takes a very talented writer to navigate the treacherous territory of YA or NAC fiction these days, without falling into the cliched, stereotypical plots/characters we've seen written to death. Awkward girl meets brooding bad boy who treats her like crap, compelling her to fall 'hopelessly' in love with him for no apparent reason other than unbridled lust and naivety.<br /><br />And that's what we're telling our daughters romance is all about???? Ick. SO not my cuppa tea!<br /><br />What I'm looking for is a NEW story, with originality and SUBSTANCE, something that bends and breaks the rules, and just knocks me down with it's awesomeness.<br /><br />Hopeless is *that* book. :D<br /><br />Almost magically, Ms. Hoover has taken all the tasty bits of the typical YA romance dynamic and woven them so perfectly into a romance that isn't ALL about the romance, with characters who actually have brains (and use them!), that are clever and funny and relatable, in the midst of a powerful and heartbreaking story that makes you laugh, cry, drool and just....ache for them. AND all written in such an eloquent, believably snarky and realistic voice, you feel connected to the story instantly. (At least for me, anyway!)<br /><br />Skye. Sarcastically sweet, slutty, Skye... a girl who actually *gasp* accepts herself and those she cares about for who they are, doesn't take herself (or all the haters out there) too seriously, and actually has more self esteem than most YA female leads out there (even considering the shipload of issues she has to work through) --and my favorite part-- she also isn't a ball-busting feminist, either. I love female leads that are (first & foremost) FLAWED, but also strong, intelligent, funny AND are still allowed to be breakable....so we can see how awesome it is when they put themselves back together again. And Skye is all those things.<br /><br />And Holder. Dear, wonderfully hot-n-senstive Holder. *sigh* I'd go running with him any day, LOL! There aren't words to describe this guy--but I will simply say Ms. Hoover created the perfectly misunderstood 'bad boy' who turns out to be the sort of guy I wish my own daughter would date, LOL!<br /><br />As much as I love Holder, though, I agree with other reviewers that he does come across as unbelievable at times, because there are very few GROWN men who  would have the emotional maturity he often shows. And while I can understand his unrealistic emotional perspective might annoy some more realistically-inclined readers, I personally couldn't get enough of his perfectly-coined declarations, because he was so beautifully written--he's word candy, if that's a thing, LOL. :)<br /><br />The plot is well-paced and compelling, but the story does switch gears rather dramatically halfway through. However, I think this is where 'Hopeless' breaks the mold of YA romances, by incorporating a REAL LIFE horror, as opposed to a supernatural or superficial one, that the couple has to work through. It's not just about *if* the couple ends up together through trivial obstacles. 'Hopeless' drops a mega-ton nuclear bomb on the couple and you have to watch them figure out a way to survive it and still end up together.<br /><br />When the tone shifted in the story, and Ms. Hoover hit me with that one little gut-twisting plot turn that changed everything, I literally gaped for a whole minute.<br /><br />I agree with others, though, about the extremely sensitive subject matter comprising the second half of the story, and recommend adding trigger warnings (not just sexual content warnings) up front for those who've suffered child molestation. Being a survivor myself, I felt it was done with extreme care and consideration, but also with a very courageous and unapologetic voice, shining light on a subject that *needs* to be brought to light. It was very validating, and therapeutic to see an author stand up and show how ugly and destructive the long-term effects of sexual abuse can be on a child...but also, that it's not 'hopeless', that we can rebuild those parts that have been broken and heal, and find strength in ourselves and in those that love us.<br /><br />So, thank you, Ms. Hoover, for being brave enough to not shy away from such a controversial subject, and for handling it with care.<br /><br />'Hopeless' is an emotionally-gripping romance with so many facets--snarky, poetic, down-to-earth, heartbreaking, devastating, shocking, and, despite it's title, chock-full of hope in the most hopeless of situations. *cue Rhianna's 'We Found Love' :)*<br /><br />P.S. Not many contemporary novels have such quote-worthy prose, but as you might have seen from other reviews, Hopeless has SO many poignant, heartfelt phrases that ring of both painful and perfect truths. You'll find yourself highlighting a LOT! :)<br /><br />Some of my faves:<br /><br />\\" It's real, Six. You can't get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. It's the fake happily-ever-afters that should piss you off.\\" ~ Skye<br /><br />Holder's speech explaining how he's in between liking and loving her-- *swoons* I more than *live* him! ;)<br /><br />\\"You don't deserve words, Skye. You deserve actions.\\" ~ Holder<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones.

Fair warning! ;)
B007N5YIUS|5.0|who doesn't like angry birds?  So much fun to play.  My son can spend hours and hours playing this game.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr Davis appeared on the Dr OZ show and made the staggering statement that no one should be eating this modern-day wheat. Dr Oz was shocked.<br /><br />Then he conducted an experiment that registered the blood sugar spike from a slice of &#34;healthy&#34; whole wheat bread<br />and the blood sugar spike from a candy bar. Guess the outcome.<br /><br />Then I thought, who is going to believe this? What would the consequences be of people choosing to not eat bread? Ever.<br /><br />You can only try it and see if you lose weight and feel better. I did and I do.
0312370849|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  This is one of my favorite books.  I recommend it to many of my friends.
B005544V6A|4.0|Great cast, very original concept (would never happen in real life or if it did, the fraud get caught eventually and those willing to protect would go down with him/her). Also great writing, haven't seen a boring episode yet, and I really like the interplay between Louis and Harvey/Mike/Jessica/Donna. Really like where this show is going, very addictive and glad the midseason break is over!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My seven year old son loves this game.  He actually has to use his noggin to figure out the puzzles.  Way better than all the other violent games out there.
B002RI9M2U|4.0|A thought provoking book for parents and teachers of teenagers and for teens themselves.<br />writen from a very interesting perspective.<br />A message to not pre-judge individuals and to try to get to know people a little better -  small guestures of kindness go a long way.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Poor Edith!  But Matthew finally quells his touch of conscience.  The saga continues, upstairs and downstairs.Season three will be as interesting as the other two seasons have been.
1609611543|5.0|I recommend that everyone read this book.  Very eye-opening. Followed the diet (or way of eating), and lost weight as well as gained energy.  Dr. Davis is also correct in that my appetite also decreased.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I ordered this on advise from a friend.  A bit too over the top for me...make that a whole lot over the top!
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I think this product is great,it was easy to learn<br /><br />it makes reading off great and easy I love it
B00846REIS|5.0|The plot was more believable in my opinion that Fifty Shades - a socialite girl and a multi-billion dollar man makes much more sense because at least they would have the potential of meeting at some social/charity event her mother dragged her to that he could have also been at, even though that is not how they met - to me it just seemed a little more believable.  Overall I just enjoyed this better...and would certainly recommend this to everyone who liked Fifty Shades, but maybe felt it was a little 'too' out there in terms of realistic.<br /><br />I can't wait for the 3rd to come out this May! :)
B00637D114|3.0|I must admit I was slightly disappointed with this movie that i'd waited so long for. I really wish it had been an animated-only movie. I think it would have been much for enjoyable and satisfactory to those who grew up in the time where the Smurfs debuted. But the graphics were amazing.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|i ordered 2 of these replacement cords for my Fire 6.  within two months, the first one quit working, so i began using the second one.  so far, its holding up, but this was not the first time i had to replace these cords, but the second time.  am i doing something wrong?
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I didn't expect to like Jeremy Renner so much in this movie. I'm a Matt Damon fan, but it was a nice surprise that this move was so engrossing. Nonstop action, great scenes and chases. Looking forward to the next movie in the series.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Impressed with rodrigues's musical talent. Words aplies to any time. Great thimes. Kind of music u can listen to all day long.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I must not have remembered the blood & gore of the first movie, because that I did not expect in this second installment. Having to see the blood from every gunshot and/or stab wound wasn't the worst thing in the world, but I thought it was overkill. I like action movies so it doesn't dissuade me from this series. Overall, the plot was decent.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|Kairosoft is one of the most-reputable devs on Google Play.  I'm delighted to see their apps here on Amazon finally.  Their onoy fault is that a couple of their apps can get a bit too Japanese culturally-speaking.<br /><br />GameDev Story is very similar to the PC text management games GameBiz and GameBiz 2 where the goal is to start as a small game dev and use your resources to put out better and better games as well as research new consoles and platforms to stay ahead of the curve.<br /><br />Sound boring?  It's not.  It's a time-sucking &quot;just one more turn&quot; kind of game most gamers will play the everloving heck out of because it's very engrossing and approachable while still having some depth and strategy.<br /><br />Hopefully Grand Prix Story, Mega Mall Story, Beastie Bay, and the rest are on their way soon.  It's about time you got here, Kairosoft!
B004DZXC30|4.0|Great movie. I'm looking forward to the follow up. Loved all the characters. They were believable and very likable. Lots of action and a couple moments I did not see coming. Just a fun movie.
B009YU62H2|4.0|King Animal is a very good album, with musical hints of Led Zeppelin and Alice in Chains. The band still sounds as great as ever, but age as taken a bit of that strong, powerful voice from Chris Cornell. I liked every song, but none jumped out as a automatic radio classic. However, if you loved the old Soundgarden, you will still appreciate the re-birth. Remember, these guys have been plaing music and singing for over twenty years.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it. It was risky and had the right amount of drama.. can't wait to start to the second book
B007YQ6SYK|3.0|'Bones' is by far the best song on this album. The others are tolerable for background noise, but lack the soul I expected. I assumed the rest of the album would be at least similar to 'Bones.' That's what I get for assuming. I do not regret buying the album. I will give the others songs another chance but I don't think I could put this on my desert island list.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|An okay book but not that intersting. Skipping around is not the nicest thing to do. stick with the plot.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This was  great ending to such a unique story. I enjoyed reading this book and found it funny and entertaining.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. I really liked the way it was written. The story line was fantastic! I would recommend this book to most teens and young adults. This book is a very easy read which is nice.
B00622B3MY|5.0|This is a great movie and my son completely loves it. He asks for it every few days and love to watch it whenever we allow him too. The only bad thing about it is that I get distracted while he is watching it because I like it as well.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|OPINION ON THE ENTIRE SERIES:<br />There are five titles in the series.  They are not complete stories.  They are sections of one long story.  The author published as he wrote.  I suggest you buy the Omnibus Edition instead of the individual titles, which will save you $1, as of the date of this review.  The Omnibus includes all five titles.<br /><br />At the end of some of the titles I was angry or frustrated at the cliffhanger endings.  For example, not knowing if the main character is dead or alive.  But the ending of title 5 is very good.  It's a happy ending for the group and one main character.<br /><br />The overall plot concept is good.  Neat ideas and events in a dystopian world.  People live in an underground silo.  The air outside causes immediate death.<br /><br />But, I was not entertained.  I wanted to read fast to get through it.  The author doesn't do characters well.  He names a bunch of people, has things happen to them, but I don't get to know them.  At one point a guy does a complete turn around in the story, but I never see it.  I don't see what led to it, why he changed, how he changed, or what he did after.  Another guy is killed at the end.  I assume I know who the guy was but the author didn't say.  And the author didn't show conversations and actions leading to that killing.  The author needs some John Grisham influence.  I get to know John's characters.  I'm pulled in emotionally.  That is missing here.<br /><br />Too many parts of the book are told and not shown.  Like reading a newspaper it can be interesting, but you are not living it.  For example, there are two battle/fight scenes.  In one, we hear there is gunfire and two are dead - but no details prior to or during.  Where are the emotions of a guy during battle?  Of seeing, fearing, reacting?  In the second battle, some guys are on the run, and I hear attackers are after them.  But no details at all.<br /><br />THIS SERIES:<br />Wool  (Wool #1)<br />Proper Gauge  (Wool #2)<br />Casting Off  (Wool #3)<br />The Unraveling  (Wool #4)<br />The Stranded (Wool #5)<br /><br />SUBSEQUENT TITLES:<br />Wool #6, 7, and 8 are a prequel trilogy telling what happened a hundred (or more) years earlier to create the silo and toxic environment.

B005S1Y5RK|1.0|I wish I would have read the one and only review of this CD before I bought it. Every word is true. I could not believe how bad the production is. \\"Remastered\\"? More like \\"Ruined\\" The recording levels are off the scale, it truly is UNLISTENABLE! DO NOT waste your time or money on this.
0446580848|5.0|i was happy with everything I bought from you.  what more can I say I am a happycustomer Very happy customer
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Such a great movie! You will want to watch over & over. It has lots of sweet connections between Efron & Schilling.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dr John McCain is not a great read read read read more information up to get together and a great Rasmussen the story and turns to get
B000FC10WU|3.0|I am a big fan of Agatha Christie and usually love her books but this one was a bit confusing.
B003NHRIUW|1.0|I wanted to watch a movie that was a bit of a chick flick, easy on the eyes, while containing something sad and heart warming.  Little did I know I'd be cringing the whole way through because of the p*** poor acting.  I wanted to watch something to switch off - Instead I actually did more work than I would have than if I hadn't of watched the movie.<br /><br />Miley Cyprus - Never realised she was a pop star, she should stick to that, at least them I would have never of had to sit through her toneless, dull, boring cliched acting.  Her teeth could have had a movie all on their own.<br /><br />And then there's the little brother, who hates her like they're worst enemies one minute, then loves her like they never fight.  Along with his overacting, they really balance each other out and not in a good way.<br /><br />The 'best friend' who she meets for the first time at the beach and they just start talking like they knew each other.  Honestly I was sitting there wondering if I'd missed some vital point in the movie - Just, no.<br /><br />The bitchy blonde ex girlfriend - Who kinda has a hate for the main character, but doesn't really (You only see her in one scene).  It's like she was just thrown in there just 'because'<br /><br />And the father - who is walking around perfectly healthy and then just happens to collapse, have cancer and dies a week later?  I really wish they would put more thought into the terminal illnesses and the way it develops.<br /><br />Finally, the love story - There is no connection, no emotion, nothing.  They simply look like they are stuck on the same set together and given a few lines to read.  Who the hell thought they would be a good couple??<br /><br />I watched this movie for free and still feel like I've lost 1 hour 40 minutes of my life. They obviously didn't just want the dad to die, they wanted the audience to die from boredom. Please don't waste your money.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It looked like fun and a way to pass some time.  Liked it a lot, especially listening to the classical music
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|I love this series and so far this is my favorite book in it! Packed full of major plot twisters at every corner!
4770031246|5.0|I've made most of the recipes in this book and often refer to it  for smaller serving dinner meals. I also reference her website and use her weekly meal planning documents to figure out grocery lists.
B000I57HTY|5.0|Great movie. No issues downloading and smooth  all the way through. Audio was perfectly synced to the visuals. Plus I am able to watch again and again.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I first downloaded a sample and became interested but didn't really get into the book until after a few chapters when I began paying attention to dates. After gaining a good understanding about how each character is connected in the book I couldn't put it down. Great story and ending, perfect.
0385536828|4.0|New facts in his novel keep coming. New characters are introduced late in the story. His writing is lovely,<br />and I understand parts, but I keep looking for the twists.  Too much to remember to keep up with the story.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved reading this book, it was a nice fast read and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie. Great story line, great character development, great overall. Definitely checking out other Matthew Quick books.
B0067LY4WG|3.0|His voice is lovely, but some of the pieces are spoken and I don't hear well. I have to read the lyrics to understand his<br />poetry.
0811876373|5.0|I follow Bakerella's blog and decided to order her official book, and absolutely love it. This book has been passed around to most of my female relatives as inspiration for party favors, bake sale items, snacks, and my recent favorite - cake pop decorating party with afternoon tea. I know there are many other cake pop books out there but I consider this one the original.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this very much,it's very fun,but this is coming from someone who love horses.Even if you don't really like horses,this is still an entertaining game for about ages 7 and up.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend of mine and I thought I'd pick it up after seeing it top various reading lists. I was in suspense for most of the book and just when you think you know the characters you're in for a shock in each progressing chapter. I wasn't into the ending at first but after thinking about it I guess I was just disappointed I reached the end of the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|i enjoyed the book well enough it contained a few surprises, the only negative to me were the love scenes, I thought for high schoolers the love scences were a little unbelievable, I enjoyed the plot and storyline.
B009G41CG2|3.0|enjoye a several games time went bye as my skills improved. liked rhe ability to enlarge as to see the tiles
B003XF1OJK|5.0|My favorite part of this book is the in depth look at how the Spartans came to be. This book basically reveals why master chief is full of so much awesomeness. Overall, a must read for halo fans.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Not ususally a horror fan but the way that this is written (as an oral history) makes it a different and interesting read.<br />It held my interest the whole way through and is a facinating concept whilst being scary at the same time.<br />Recommend to all Zombie and non-Zombie fans alike.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|My son picked this out while flipping through things to do on a boring day, and my entire family became addicted.  It has very difficult higher levels, well worth it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love this game, got it on my iPod, but it doesn't tilt on the kindle. Maybe my gyroscope is messed up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I actually don't agree that the ending was a disappointment.  I believe it was perfect.  Out of the thousands of books I have read, this is a rare gem I will remember details about.  I loved the story.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Must get I mean its free fun and addicting how much better can you get. Plus I think there cute and I love the funny noises they make.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I disliked this book into 3 chapters.  I forced myself to 8 chapters, and I just couldn't get any further.  The constant repetition of words, the insanely cheesy plot... This appears to be a huge hit with women that have been sheltered in their life experiences but for those of us that haven't been... Total cheese.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Of course, Lee Child is a great author.  I've read everything by him.  If you haven't read him, start with his first book, Killing Floor.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice application, good graphics. Gems accumulate slowly as with games of this type but all in all a nice app, good for all ages who enjoy simulation style games.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|This movie is very dark and all the characters are crazy! Matthew McConaughey is a great actor but not his best movie!
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|The final book in the series doesn't disappoint. Sometimes the extensive details of the judicial system or other systems involved get overwhelming, but in general a page turner, difficult to put down!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Great app with many options to find a sound that works for you.  Alarm clock is another good feature. Sleeping much better these days.  One down fall is that you cannot combine sounds.
B005RJI67I|5.0|This small set worked very well as a stocking stuffer and the minifigure is well designed too.  Not much more to say - kids are enjoying it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|A typical good Jack Reacher book. Entertaining.<br />Got what I expected, and enjoyed the adventure of the hero.<br />Plan on reading more of them -on # 3 now.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|This movie simplifies the science and uses dramatic overtones to create a slightly eyebrow raising experience, but does manage to have an impact on the viewer and represents at least some of the inconvenient truth.
B005GSVFBE|5.0|The movie jumps leaps and bounds with the BD version.  If you have a BD player and HDTV there is no reason you should still be playing that 16 year old DVD! :)<br /><br />I have not tried the 3D version yet.  Please see other reviews.<br /><br />The Digital Copy is in SD, and poor SD at that.  It's made to be small and only take 1 GB of space on your phone/tablet. I haven't confirmed this version, but I've read some Digital Copies audio is actually duplicated mono to both the Left and Right channels so people wearing one earbud will hear all the sound.  I recommend using Handbrake to *coughRIP* your DVD movie onto your device if space is less an issue.<br /><br />If you are running iTunes sharing in your home, you could even put the full *coughRIP* DVD movie on your computer/iTunes server to stream higher quality SD to your tablets/devices.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|When I loaded the DVD the message wa \\"this disc will not play in your region\\".  I have had many DVD's before, including season one of Downton, and have never had that happen.  What a waste!  -Bob
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I finally got the BD because my kids enjoyed the DVD so much I felt it would be a worthwhile purchase.  Man this move is funny!<br /><br />My small kids were scared for a while by the small dog/monster, but I love that this movie's villian is a goofy nerd instead of a evil monstrous man.<br /><br />The DVD and digital copy are on a singular DVD and come in a paper sleeve behind the paper insert.  The BD case was obviously not made to hold it and that is fine with me and most other since the DVDs normally get put with other DVDs in a CD/DVD case for road trips, etc.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good story line for t h e price a great weekend read.  Realistic setting on the red planet - thank you
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This was my son's (9 yrs) big Christmas present and we built it as family during the 2 days after Christmas.  It did take alot of time to build, but there is such variety in the building that we never felt bored.  In fact both my husband and I were caught sneaking off and working on it by ourselves.  A month later and my son is still playing with it.  The way the floors break apart makes it much more conducive to playing or just moving the mini figures around.  The elevator is definitely my son's favorite feature -- mine too.  This is probably not the best choice for your first big Lego build, but for the intermediate level and up it is rewarding. Check out the YouTube video of the actual designer doing a demo if you want a more detailed look at the building itself.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|This was better than I expected.  There were enough twists in the plot to keep it interesting and the characters were OK.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I really love this CD.  The lead singer's voice is so amazing.  The lyrics and the music is greas as well.  Recommend!
0930289234|5.0|Better than expected, this graphic novel is fantastic. Drawings are very nice and the story is simply amazing. Definitely recommended.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Where on earth did I get the idea this was about a boy bonding with a wild tiger?  Completely different than I had expected and it was an amazing read!  A great story about survival, acceptance and truth.  I have recommended this to all my friends and family.
140120841X|5.0|It's different and far better than the movie. But I expected that, of course. If you like graphic novels, this one is recommended.
B009XY97VC|5.0|With so much of this type of music out there now days I still find TSFH the best over all. Some will only give you half as much music per album and it will be of lesser quality than TSFH.<br />This album hits all the right emotional buttons with me and can bring a tear to my eyes at times, great melodies and performances on them all...well... &#34;All Is Hell That Ends Well&#34; is great till the end and then I either have a bad download or they messed up using the sounds of some electronic hell that hits me like a knife to the eardrum. Well not that bad, but I still don't like it and will try to edit it out or change it to something that doesn't grate on my nerves. It's still a real nice piece of music, even with the hell at the end.<br />I would recommend this download to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is pretty fun. the only thing that stinks is it doesn't always open. but I have a blast when it does open
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|good game for all ages.  and easy for the younger ones to learn about animals and where they are from.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|Not up to the Hollywood hope it got , was a little slow , and if not aware of  India's way of life may not get it . Great collection of Actors . Can be a pleasant evening with nothing being blown up
B009JZTOG8|3.0|it plays great  but it's disappointing to pay 1·99 an episode. I think you should get a discount if you buy the entire season at one time.
B002V3OWNU|5.0|Amazing!  Excellent live performance.  It's not just JM's amazing talent, it's also the musical arrangements.  The horns really knock it out of the park!  I think JM should put out a live album after every major tour, the studio albums just aren't the same.
B0062YADWI|5.0|Its inexpensive, Well Made, and looks good.  I wanted to add a carabiner clip and a bottle opener to my keychain, found both in one and it also has a wrench that i use to loop my keychain through.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lightweight and durable<br />inexpensive<br />Great utility<br />wrench you can use to loop a keyring through<br /><br />Cons:<br />None
B00973DDN2|5.0|I have never listened to the Killers very much, but this album is hard to stop listening to. Fantastic and so worth the purchase.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was my first John Green read. I will absolutely look for more from him. Think literature and life, not cancer when considering this book.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I knew this was a great movie so I got it for my fiance for Christmas. The quality was awesome, and it was just as I expected it to be.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I'm very impressed with this book. I could hardly stop reading it. I was through chapter 6 and barely 2% through the book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A good book, but not as good as some of Mr.Grisham's previous works. I was not disappointed though. I usually figure out the plot way before finishing the book and I have to say &#34;didn't see it this time&#34;.
B002361MLA|5.0|Essential spiritual book for everybody. I gave this book as present to all my family members. Not religious spiritual. Must have book!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|very nice. great. way to introduce kids to music. I even play with the app. good value gray selection of songs
B008KP2VZY|4.0|Most other cloud apps like skydrive and Google drive are almost useless if you do not have a internet connection. I love this app even over SME cloud sync. This app actually syncs between your clouds and your devise. I love having access to files on my phone editing and saving them and foldersync automatic syncing right back on the cloud from my phone. I love being able to access all my cloud drives right on my phone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't have enough time to write a long review. But... can I just say wow! Love it!! College Hoover is in my top 3 favorite writers.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Movement is rough, environments are deceptively small and disgusting, really involved with little bang for the buck<br /><br />If you had never heard of this game by word of mouth, and had accidentally stumbled across Minecraft, it might really make your day. Hyped to no end, I can see how some would be impressed by this game. Building your environment &quot;brick by brick&quot; to create buildings and structures, sounds like an enchanting virtual experience! It's a reminiscent of my childhood days putting Lego bricks together to build fortresses and starships. The game itself is pretty deep, but rather unsatisfying. No explosions or soundtracks, gunplay, cars, skills,characters,  etc. just a good old fashion hipster sit-in. Though it has the open ended playability of a game like Gary's mod, or the open-mindedness of a SIM game, it's not cerebral and never raised my pulse over 90. I felt ashamed paying 7 dollars for this game, As if  I had totally taken the bait to buy this cubic nightmare. If you like the game I understand. I found out the hard way it really wasn't for me. I need a more challenging experience, plus getting into the game is about as &quot;casual&quot; as pyramid building. Recommended for diehard fans coming from PC, Stoners high school kids with a lot of time on hand, and imaginative Children.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|This movie was very interesting and I ended up being somewhat glued to the screen.  I enjoyed the way the people worked together in their relationships as a family unit.  Even as a movie the things they did seemed to be very normal then all of a sudden wow.  From that point on I was hooked.  To find out that this had a history also made it really stand out for me.  This is not for the timid...things do go bump in the night but if you are in the mood for a good movie that will make you jump and keep you interested without any gore this is the movie for you.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Great Series! Unless yer a nerd like me, ya only get half the humor of this show. Science and comic books rule!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game I got all year and I haven't even had a kindle for a year even though it is several dollars it is TOTALLY worth the money so I say and I say again best game of all time!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing. I couldn't put it down for days. It's practically my life. And how I feel. This book deserves a 5 star because it has passion, courage and gave me hope
0345803485|1.0|If you enjoy juvenile, repetitive, one dimnesional garbage then you'll love this book.  Ridiculously flat characters, unbelievable and uninteresting dialogue, and laugh out loud sex scenes abound in this crap with covers.  Your money would be better spent on, well, anything other than this book (and I use that word loosely).  If you want more details about why this book sucks then read the many other bad reviews; they are packed full of examples that will leave you scratching your head.  I simply felt it was my duty to try to save some other poor soul from spending their hard earned money on such drivel.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Excellent read...<br /><br />I'm impressed with such writing<br />I could not put my kindle down  it gives hope and courage to all
B0063GORYU|5.0|The aces go at the end, more like 11, than a 1, confusing if you are not aware of it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run, but for some reason, when I press save me the game freezes and cuts off. Please fix this glitch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book! So glad I read it! I was unsure at first but it is the best book I have ever read!
B003L77TZI|5.0|This was my first introduction to Katy Perry, and I really like it.<br /><br />I carry it in my car and listen to it all the time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know exactly what it is about this book that I love most, but this book is one of my all-time favorites.  I've read it five times and will read it again many times in the future.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I wish they offered half stars because this was certainly better than a 4-star book! This book really surprised me! I had no idea what it was even about, friends on fb were raving about how GREAT of a story it was and a MUST READ. I'm truly GLAD that I did read it, everyone should read this book. Interesting from the beginning. A lot of unexpected turns.<br /><br />This was a very deep and dark read with twists and turns. The romance is very heart warming, the story is eye opening & left at the end wondering: What in the world would I do if I were in Sky's place?  Actually I give her strength for what she did and would more than likely have done the same thing if I was in her shoes. I became very emotionally invested in these characters, the heartache, twists, turns, young love.<br /><br />1 out of every 5 women in this country are sexual abuse survivors, I applaud anyone who can write a story let alone a book about sexual abuse. 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 20 boys is a victim of child sexual abuse, sad sad world we live in.<br /><br />Thank you Colleen Hover for writing such an awesome book and to tell the story the way you did.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show, love the characters, love the story lines and love the way new characters are regularly added to the script. I can hardly wait for the next show.
1451695195|5.0|A most unusual journey within the NDE genre!  So interesting I've purchased extra copies for friends. Would highly recommend Dr. Alexander's book to anyone of an agnostic persuasion. You won't be disappointed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading the first book, I wanted more.  Waiting for the second book \\"Reflected in You\\" felt like forever; however, it was a great read! I loved how the story developed and slowly bit by bit, you learned some things about Gideon.  Toward the end of the book, I could not put it down. I can't wait for the third book!! If you loved the \\"50 Shades\\" books, just as much as I have, these are great books to follow up with!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|The actors did a great job and I loved this movie. Diane Lane is perfect for her role and I enjoyed the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great for horse lovers. even if you like to get a little out there with crazy hair or unicorns it allows that but best off all you get to show your horses talents.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|keeps the interest up and is quite fun and colorful. in some ways it is reminiscent of Quell. nice for distracting the mind when waiting for short term things like taxi arrivals.<br />would recommend to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband got his Kindle for Christmas and right away loaded the game Angry Birds.  He really enjoys it and says I need a Kindle so I can play Angry Birds too.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this show once I started.  I was completly suprised by this show at how good it really was.
B005LAII12|1.0|Crude, Rude, & vulgar. What more is there to say. Thought this would be a fun movie for my Grandkids to watch. Glad I watched it first, they will NOT be watching it.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I love this app, especially since the app is free! But it gets a little annoying when every month theres a new update :D lol it takes forever to get 3 stars on most of the levels XD The app would be 5 stars if there were some minor bug fixes!
B000063Y8F|5.0|I recently started replacing my older, cheaper kitchen tools with higher quality ones.  I've bought several Rosle items and have been impressed with every one. This garlic press works wonderfully and is a breeze to clean.

B008DM4OTA|5.0|My kids love these Dr. Panda games and they appear to be well made.  I would recommend to anybody that likes a fun little game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book because of Katniss' character growth throughout the whole story, plus the promise of new growth in future stories.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|A great simple to use alarm app. I use it everyday multiple times a day. From waking me up to remembering to do something
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|the puzzles are fun and challenging there are surprising twists to the story line. yghhjujnnkllm bbbhjnnnb hfds. bvfd huff hhhjk iopkn
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|It is done in the style of a documentary. If you are looking for your typical romantic comedy, or otherwise, this is not it. I like that about it - nothing glitter or glamor. The acting is wonderful, genuine - you forget that it's not a documentary. It doesn't have the Hollywood ending, which I also like. Has moments of real humor, drama (not melodrama, thank goodness) - sincerity. Wonderful film - if I had anything negative to say, and I really don't, it went on a bit long. But, as to the overall integrity of the film, it was absolutely fine. Enjoyed it very much.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Super padded, very well made, holds a great deal of my equipment.<br />The ONLY reasons i did a 4 star instead of 5 are; the tripod straps would never hold a full sized DSLR tripod, more than that, my camera doesn't have a good fit if I have my Battery grip on... Which I ALWAYS have on, unless I'm using my back up battery in a quick switch situation.<br />I'm looking forward to see how well it does around a little water.<br /><br />For the money, it's the Best camera bag I've come across.
B0018AT7M8|2.0|Rush has great songs (at least their older stuff) but it seems like all their live albums are recorded with a mic in the crowd. They need to put out a professionly recorded live album that doesn't sound so muddied.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I see now why it cleaned house at the Golden Globes. It has absolutely been worth the price of purchase.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|loved this game. The story was good..maybe a little too much talk...but that's just me so I kind of fast forwarded it... the Zoom came in very handy and the mini games were good.<br />I found out after I wrote this that although I loved the game there are a couple of things I noticed..in the level that says to collect all the goblets you need to collect anythiung that can hold water and when you are collecting amulets collect all items that can go around your neck.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|A funny comedy, nothing groundbreaking by any means, but a funny movie to watch none the less. I enjoyed it.
B000UJ48XG|5.0|Beirut never fails to please, and this is no exception!  I received it for Christmas, and I've listened to at least some of it almost every day since.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time, everything about it is fantastic. I can't recommend it enough if you haven't seen it, you definitely need to!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves this movie, the characters are all cute, and she loves the songs as well.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|While the content of this book is great, I think the talk he gave on PBS about it was better, since it cut out a lot of fluff.  As someone who would like to go straight to the practical application and refer back to what to do, i would have appreciated a list of the things to do somewhere, instead of peppered in the book. That's the only issue with it as far as I can see though.
0060594896|5.0|He does a great job of laying out proven concepts in a simple to follow manner. The chapters are short which makes it easy to do the exercises. If you are ready to make a change this book will definitely help.
B009HSVHV2|4.0|This will probably be nobody's first time listening to KISS, so anyone who gets this is probably already a KISS fan. That said, it's a great addition to their catalogue. After existing for years as more-or-less a nostalgia act based on the strength of their live shows, it's cool that their most recent 2 albums (40 years into their career!) hold up with the things they released in their heyday. They played Hell or Hallelujah on their tour with Motley Crue, but there are better songs on Monster.
1592332803|5.0|Every recipe I've made has turned out great. The chocolate chip cookies are our favorite. I've received many compliments on the desserts from this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I Love Nicholas Sparks.  This Book keeps You interested Start To Finish.  I recommend this Book to Everyone.  I am looking forward to more books from Nicholas Sparks.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm not a huge Stephen King fan but this book was different. I enjoyed this very huge novel and was left to ponder the possibilities it suggested. I did have the book but it's so heavy, I downloaded it to my Kindle so I could finish it on vacation.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|This is a really nice box and book package to house the discs.  The resolution and visual quality of the blu-ray is a huge improvement on the quality of the dvds.<br />As some noted, while the DVDs did not have the broadcast versions, but the somewhat longer versions with a few extra lines and sequences, this set features only the broadcast edits of the shows.<br /><br />There are some nice bonus features, still, in the set.  I'm very happy with the set.
0393342212|5.0|OK, that is not what the authors said, but as an only child married to a husband with a semi-dysfunctional family of 6 siblings, I wanted a happy and more loving family and to make sure we did not pit these kids against each other. It is an easy and quick read, and very practical. Written as the authors thoughts/notes while teaching a parenting class, you get many examples (kids and adult siblings) as well as two or three ways to digest the materials (actual cartoon images to illustrate).  While some may think that sounds too childish or repetitive, statistics show that you will be more likely to remember things you see AND hear, and believe me, you do want to remember this stuff when you are trying to resolve screaming/crying matches between your children.  I should correct myself to say trying to \\"help\\" resolve, because you can't do it alone (you'll see what I mean when you get the book). I believe that my children are happier and more loving towards each other because of what I have learned and continue to relearn from my dog-earred copy of this book.  Buy it, gift it, and good luck!
B0042AEOG0|3.0|Basically bought the cd for the &#34;All I Want for Christmas is You&#34;, love that song.  Some of the other songs are a little to pop for me, but it's definitely an upbeat Christmas cd.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|They continually evolve one of the few bands that have not lost there vision, can`t wait to see the concert in Florida in April
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book so I would be biased and not compare the two. Having now read the book, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Could read and reread it several times.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|I had high hopes for this installment of the Bourne series, but without Matt Damon, the movie just fell flat.  It just couldn't keep my attention, and I ended up turning it off ten minutes from the end.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|It's a matter of taste, of course, but I didn't enjoy Season 2 as much as the 1st. Season 2 is much more sadistic and gory, and lacks the supernatural suspense and mysterious backstories that S1 characters had. In S1 I was looking forward to unraveling mysteries in the next episode; in S2 I was waiting for the story to get interesting.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater and didn't really have any expectations.  I was wowed from start to finish, which is saying something, because I don't usually see or like movies based on comic book characters.  This one had such a good storyline, effects, and acting that I watched it a second time from Amazon.
141694737X|5.0|Cute little book. Would recommend it for little ones. The pop up pages keep the kids entertained. Would recommend it!
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My kids (and I) have seen the other Wimpy Kid movies, and this one didn't disappoint.  Funny flick for the whole family!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|It seemed a little disjointed but I enjoyed it, There certainly was plenty of action.<br />The concept of meeting oneself by time travel was interesting,
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game very fast paced and exciting everyone should try it.....very addictive you wont put it down once you start playing
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Love this movie, watched it over and over again.  Part two is also awesome, really hoping for a part three!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed the book. Nicholas Sparks, knows how to pull at the heartstrings. I have read many of his books and he has never failed me yet. He is one of my favorite.
B004MYFV0O|5.0|It is a very good book, easy to understand with some good lessons. It is a begging book though, the most basic techniques for drawing.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I loved this game when I first got it on my original DS and it has been just as much fun on my HTC Vivid
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|problem solving, kids have fun and adults too. alot of different screens to play. good variety with levels and difficulty.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book can't wait to start the second one.  I couldn't put it done.  As I was reading it was like I was there.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I thought I had a very good  imagination,  but  this story was way  tooo far out and boring for me!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Ok so the book was pretty good it took me like 2 days to finish it I am a very fast reader but I love the book<br />P.S Thanks for putting book on my kindle fire I love it
3527406018|3.0|its not very easy to connect dots most of the time..it could have been better...covered most subject but very clear some of the subejcts
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|Maybe, for some reason, this product isnt meant to work on a laptop display port. I bought 3 because the new laptop HDMI port is on the right, so the heavy cable sticks out too much (used to having this in the back). Bought 3 (one for home, one for work, one for travel) but ALL 3 did absolutely nothing. No signal from display to laptop at all. The laptop port and the HDMI cable are all fine (all works fine w/o the adapters). So either I got a REALLY unlucky pull from inventory, or this adapter is just low quality. To go 0 for 3 though - I smell a rat.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt's impersonation of a young Bruce Willis wasn't bad, and Bruce Willis was his usual Die Hard self. Overall, it was a solid movie!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I must be honest, I have seen The Language of Flowers in every bookstore, every book newsletter I get, and on the bestseller lists.  Why I never picked it up, I have no idea.  I saw it on LibraryThing.com's list of books that could be requested.  I figured if I won a copy, it would be meant to be, and I would finally read this popular book.<br /><br />I won and I am so glad The Language of Flowers found me!  I can't tell you enough how much I loved this book!  I devoured it in 24 hours.  This between raising 3 little girls, a cat and 2 puppies, plus my niece's birthday party in San Diego.  Needless to say, I read this book every moment I found myself with a extra minute or two.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers tells the story of Victoria and begins when she is 18 and emancipated from the foster system she has been in her whole life.  The book travels back and forth from current time to Victoria's time with her foster mother, Elizabeth.  It is this relationship that shapes Victoria and her views of herself and love.<br /><br />Victoria learns the language of flowers from Elizabeth.  The flowers that surround Victoria tell her story and speak for her many times when she cannot speak for herself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!  It is seriously one of my favorites.  There were so many emotions I went through reading it, crying tears of sadness and joy, sometimes at the same time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was probably one of the best books I have ever read. This is a book I couldn't put down and never has a book made me feel so many different emotions. Collins Hoover wrote this very well and her approach is real. finished book in 4 days and (3) 12hr work shifts :-) and yes, I love Holder. Lol
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Someone told me to read Proof of Heaven.  It is a book about a near death experience.  What makes this book different is that it is written by a neurosurgeon and is based is on his own experience.<br /><br />My mom went through a very difficult procedure in the hospital last year.  It ended up she needed emergency brain surgery (craniotomy) and watching her come out of it and wondering if she would be the same, was a horrible ordeal.  Being on a neuro ICU unit for 4 weeks, I was so curious as to what she was going through.  She would talk once in her sleep, she wasn't in a coma, she was heavily sedated.  Did she have a near death experience?  No.  But I was so curious and this book sounded right up my alley. She did have \\"ICU Psychosis\\" which is theme described in the book and really helped me understand what she was going through at that point.  Her dreams were so real to her, she really believed these tings were happening.<br /><br />Being a neurosurgeon and understanding the brain is one thing.  To be a scientist that always brushed off these stories of near death experiences, and having your own, is all together different.  This book is a  very quick read.  It doesn't drag, it takes you on a ride and is so interesting.  Here is scientist that questioned his faith and is now having a NDE that was so real.<br /><br />For anyone interested and especially for people that wonder about these things, this is a book for you.  What a great book club read it would be.  There are so many discussions here to be had.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This was a quick and fun read.  Especially if one is relaxing on a beach.  No intricate subplots or a large host of characters to remember when one is trying to relax under the warm sun.  Overall a decent book.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I really wanted to see this movie... But really thought it would be...crap!... So.. Fighting it off as long as i could...i finally broke down and brought it for the 3D(which in previews looked great)... So..i can honestly say this was a really good film..... Great visuals...great 3d... Good humor, story line, acting, cast... Everything..It just works!!! I found myself really enjoying this movie... Not expecting much at all!!! Which hurt me because i was disappointed by the ending...
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I shall tell you in the morning. it all depends on if I wake up. 7am. really early but the kids have got to get up.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I am not into the whole vampire theme but this was pretty bad ass, maybe because it portrayed a historical figure fighting the vampires, I don't know but I liked it!
B006N0MLJO|5.0|Very handy, better than Construction Master dounload for the same price, would recomend it to any builder. a great product.
0679805273|5.0|Just as described there were a few words in the book, but overall worth it. It was kind of like new.
0802473156|5.0|I am a MFT and one of the couples I saw mentioned this book.  The idea - that how we express, and experience, love - is very personal and not the same for all of us, is an important idea for everyone to understand.  Not particularly well written, and since the ideas were not new to me Its not a favorite.  But I know that for my client couple that first discovered these ideas it was an important book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played once and then turned it off so it could charge  and when I tried to reopen it it stop working<br />other wise I do reckemend
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|So funny best one yet omg how dose he do it. Can' t be a spoiler sorry but I can't wait for the new one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app I got it on my I pad and then I found it on the kindle and I was zoology happy
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Be ready to be focused while watching this one, but that's what makes it captivating. Loved the plot and trying to figure out what was happening the whole time. It kept us guessing!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Bingo but difficult to play.  Hate that I have to be on the internet to play. That is hard when traveling and not internet available.
B00721TTAM|4.0|But after receiving it I realized how small the set actually is...probably could've gotten a larger set for the same price somewhere locally!
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book was inspiring to never ever give up. It was the best book. WhAt really was Inspiring is that when you get hurt always keep your head up and try your hardest. It was a great book.  Write another one like it.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Sorry I didn't see it in the theatre! The cast was amazingly funny..Jennifer Anniston (totally outside of her regular characters..loved her!!), Jason Bateman (who would get raped the most in prison??? Lmao!!!)...Charlie Day (the little Hamster!!!)...and always loved Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx (Mofo Jones)!!<br /><br />Highly recommend this movie..will keep you laughing beginning til the end!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best temple run yet. It has improved graphics from the first one and brave. And more features such as the zip line and the mine. But one thing I kind of like but kind of don't is that some of the stores items are more expensive than the first one. And if you have never played temple run before and your not sure if you want it just because you think that it's a waste of time. It's not that's why so many people out there love this game.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I was looking for an app that I can transfer the music from my computer to my cell phone in the easiest possible way, and I found it!!  This app is INCREDIBLE!!  So easy to navigate and use.  LOVE IT!!
B008VBYN80|3.0|I'll see how soon it wants me to break out my wallet. Tired of investment games. So far it hasn't asked for money!
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|I wasn't blown away by this. It was interesting enough, but I was not impressed at all by Lucy Liu, and I thought I would be. There wasn't enough resemblance to Sherlock Holmes for me. It was fine as a detective show, but not satisfying as a Holmes spin-off.
B0064BWDRW|4.0|The story was fast paced and kept me guessing right to the end. Harry Hole character is very believable and his damaged nature is appealing.
B009EEKPWQ|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who likes fashion and is looking for a good laugh!  Maryl Streep is incredible (as always), and so is Anne Hathaway.  Two thumbs up for this movie!!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Super convenient... Only not getting 5 stars because it has been crashing on me lately :( Love that I can see the daily deals easily though!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found the writing style did not keep my interest, and the story line, well, I just could  not even finish this book. I think it is poorly written, and did not in any way hold my interest. Disappointing. I cannot recommend &#34;Gone Girl&#34; to anyone.
B001IFZL50|5.0|Alexander Skarsgard is to die for in Generation Kill. All the actors do a great job portraying their emotions and the seriousness of the situations they face. I strongly recommend this series to absolutely anyone. LOVELOVE.
0547564651|5.0|Good book recommended but not read as of yet. I think this would be a good book to add to my collection for review.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I thought this show may lose its hilarity as the seasons progressed... No, this show just keeps getting better. One of my favorite comedic sitcoms!
B00ARN0WBW|5.0|Over all Paranormal Activity 4 was a really good movie.  What I really enjoyed was the little twists in the story that were unexpected.  This makes me look forward to the next movie.
B0086213XW|4.0|Thought it was way underrated-especially at 3 stars here on Amazon. Happy I watched it. Would recommend. Thought it was different- maybe a touch of Indie. Williams always picks great roles though.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|my autisic son loves this game.It is great to get him to talk.Wish there were more for the kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. its a great way to pass time. the picture is very good quality. like all of the options.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a breeze to read as after each chapter I just wanted to know what the other was going to do/say. It was suspenseful and very well written in my opinion. I recommend this book for any adult reader..
B005VTS4EY|1.0|This game is pretty amusing. Only one star, though, since it nags me to review it every time I go to the main menu.
0345403959|5.0|I have read this book before many times and was replacing it after loaning it out and never receiving it back. Would definately reccommend it to friends.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|I tend to purchase songs rather than albums now and days since usually I don't enjoy all the songs I have to purchased on one album, but I knew with Little Voices, it would be a different story. I have thoroughly enjoyed every song that Sara Bareilles has put on this album and enjoy having her music on as I study or relax at home.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|As much as I enjoyed Ruth Wilson, the story, however, strayed to far from both the novel and especially the character of Jane.
B000YAG00A|1.0|Some reason, I could not play the disc properly, it would run for the first ten minutes but got unstable and eventually froze on me. Had to return it. Some day I'd love to have this in my collection.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Prior to buying this book i was not a reader at all the last time i read a book was 5yrs ago , I decided that while on my way on vacation i would get this book the plane trip was 7hours by the time i landed i was half threw the first. the books are sexy and tastefully writen and the storyline keeps you intrigued.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I chose this because Channing Tatum is a good, young actor. I gave it this rating because I enjoyed the movie. I would recommend Magic Mike to any Channing Tatum fan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It keeps you guessing.  You won't be sorry purchasing this book.  The author gives you some very interesting characters.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book! It is easy to open it to any section and get lost in the thoughts and descriptions of both the scene being described and the human conditions that are portrayed by the zombie genre. Mr. Brooks did a great job on this book, you won't be disappointed in this purchase if you are a fan of any aspect the zombie experience.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It kept you guessing until the end.  Don't want to give away the ending.....just read it, you won't be sorry.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Need to many words in evaluating<br />9 year old grandchild<br />Christmas gift<br />On childs list<br />Parents<br />Very entertaining<br />to time consuming
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was also a very enjoyable book.  The characters were great and the storyline kept you guessing.  Think it will be a very good movie too.
B000N4SHOE|3.0|This was very interesting, and educational of how these books came about and what a great story about the woman who wrote the children's books.  &#34;Peter Rabbit&#34;. Lovely film.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Occasionally I get some static (RF interference) in the right head phone. Also, the batteries tend to shift slightly out of position and the whole set up shuts down. Then again, my rechargeable AAA batteries might be just a bit smaller than regular AAA batteries. I corrected this by wedging in a folded piece of paper into the battery compartment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so cool everyone should get it! it is a lot better than the first one! it is so exciting to play! I love it!!!!!!!
B003VANOFY|3.0|pros: pretty good quality, reasonably comfortable. battery lasts 10 hours. good base. better than my onboard realtek. wireless range is over 20 feet in a normal home. good mic quality  cons: gets a little uncomfortable after a few hours. had a few problems with the wireless, but it wasn't due to the headset. slight software problems with skype and mumble, but still functions just fine  HAD TO RMA TWICE DUE TO electrical issues, and due to the swivel breaking. also, after 5 months, swivel broke on the replacement as well
B001FB5634|5.0|The Road-even the title is thought provoking. What does it mean? Is the movie about the journey on the \\"road\\" that the man and his boy take? Yes. Is the movie saying something about the \\"road\\" that all humans take-the journey through life? I think so. What is the viewer to conclude? Perhaps, that what is most important to us all in the journey is our relationships with each other. The material things that we have are not the \\"stuff\\" of life-but the relations are. If we strip away all the \\"things\\" of our normal existence-what do we have left? That is the question we all must answer. Set in a futuristic world where everything has been pretty much destroyed, the man and his son discover each other in a way they had not before. The film is not a \\"feel good\\" experience. It's dark and scary. You will get nervous watching it. Yet, even when you have concluded that the world was toasted with nature completely wiped out-the pair find a living insect. A living bug! As it flies away, you realize that even in that gloomy world-there is hope.
1419707663|5.0|This purchase was a Christmas gift for my grandson.  he requested the books and is very pleased.  he just reported yesterday (Tues, 1/22) that he is now reading his 2nd book (of course, I don't know which one that is by the way - but assuming he started on book #1, then he is now reading #2).  He has read some of this series before but wanted the entire series to own for himself.<br /><br />Needless to say, if he's happy, I'm happy!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I heard all great things about this movie so I wanted to see this movie. I love that I knew all the songs and wanted to sing along the whole time.

B003NFM3JK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I wish it was in 3D like it was shown in theaters but it is still great nonetheless :)
B004GVUPFE|4.0|This is a fun little game.  Once you get started, it will drive you nuts until you find the solution.
034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love theses books! I have read them once but I am excited to have the set because the first time I read them, I had to borrow each book and now I can read them whenever I want!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Checked off my Xmas list my husband loved his stocking stuffer! Great Movie! One we like to watch over and over again!
B008CJ0KBU|3.0|These DVD's both season one & season two are exactly what the Scifi channel shows,the only difference is no commercials. You also get the skips or blank spots where commercials would be inserted. Do not get me wrong, this is a great show, love the characters & the story line. The boxes state unrated & uncut, but this is not true. If you look at the fine print on the box, it states TV14 as a rating & as I stated, the content is not uncut. So my only complaint here is the false advertising, truly bogus...
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|It arrived super fast! I got it way in advance of my Xmas shopping at the time and am now just waiting to get a deal on Season 2! Got this for a steal during Black Friday and my husband and I love the show.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|using this to drive some m50's and it makes a Huge difference over regular computer. I would def recommend this device.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an excellent read. Great characters and plot. I can not wait to read the rest of the series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just downloaded this app hope it's better than the original version of Temple Run on the fire. Plus it's FREE!!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really liked this book.  It made me think of my chances of survival under extreme circumstances and what I would be willing to do to survive.  I gained new perspective on zoo animals and whether they are &#34;happy&#34; living in their environment.
B004KKX814|5.0|Bueno a mi hijo le apasiona este juguete tiene 8 a&ntilde;os y no hace mas que hablar de el, en cuanto a la entrega todo a tiempo y en optimas condiciones el producto.... saludos desde Venezuela
B00AREIAI8|5.0|could not believe how fun this app is. I love horses and I can definatley say that if love horses you will love this app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fun,fast, and entertaining.<br />I think it's a fun and enjoying experience to read this book.<br />Lots of action but also a love story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is safe and awesome game for kids. I love it because I can't put my kindle down. You should get Subway Surfers and you won't regret getting it.
B00929G8SS|2.0|I am one f those persons that when people ripped on manowar for loosing their \\"touch\\" I would still defend their work their work. However, this time I will not. Boring songs, booooring. If I wasn't driving I would have fallen asleep
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg I was wait for this my hole life. just nodding the best I've play it on my moms I phone so. better yet the monkey is wayyyyy bigger.
B004P98QZ8|4.0|He loves this set. He has built it several times just for fun. Would recommend it for any 8 year old.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie IT was in great condition and a very good movie I loved it I think if u love horror movies u have to see IT
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great quality, great movie, great presentation!!!!!!!!!!  i so glad to give this movie.  Was a little slow the shipped (to Colombia) but im really happy.
B003VPWXRO|3.0|I've read better books on he same topic. It was OK, but a bit &#34;drippy&#34;, it lacked personality and punch. The first half of the book held my interest, but I found myself skipping pages then chapters towards the end. Interesting topic though .
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a hard to put down book. The ending makes you think about the consequences of all we do.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I saw the movie first and then had to read the book. The book is just as beautiful as the movie with life changing descriptions of a young man's experience. I would recommend this story to adults and students alike.
1401322786|5.0|Son was thrilled about getting the book and I can't wait for him to finish it so I can borrow it.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Interesting story, but a bit draggy and confusing at times. The performances were strong though and overall I enjoyed it.
1455523550|5.0|I loved the surprise ending, because it was uplifting, after I had been suffering the abuse along with Katie.  Nicholas Sparks writes about an issue that definitely needs more exposure.
B0036TGT3E|3.0|The song &#34;this is the morning report is left out of the bluray version. The daughters her dissappointed at that. I got this as a collector. The missing song devalues it.
B0056BBO1W|5.0|Great sound tracks-fair price-easy to download and transaction was simply and quick. Would recommend if you like this artist or type of music.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I'd like a refund. Don't waste your money  on this book. In comparison with his other books, this just wasn't that good IMO.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A good sequel to the Hunger Games, looking forward to finishing the trilogy. Collins does a fantastic job building suspense.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Es ist ein spannendes und abwechslungsreiches Spiel.Die Minispiele und die Wimmelbilder machen Spaß. Leider immer zu kurz, aber nie langweilig.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Takes awhile to master the game but very challenging . It will<br />become habit forming so watch out I warned you
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I loved this movie and was so excited to get the soundtrack.  I know that it is called &#34;Highlights&#34;, but it left out my two favorite songs.  Mainly, I am shocked that &#34;Do you hear the people sing&#34; was not on this CD!  There is a bit of it in the very last track, but that is all.  As a reminder to all you Les Mis fans, here's how the song starts:<br />&#34;Do you hear the people sing?<br /> Singing a song of angry men?<br /> It is the music of a people<br /> Who will not be slaves again!<br /> When the beating of your heart<br /> Echoes the beating of the drums<br /> There is a life about to start<br /> When tomorrow comes!&#34;<br />In the movie, this is sung at least three times, including the urchin Gavroche singing it a capella when the students are feeling low.  I cannot conceive why it was left out of the soundtrack.<br />The other song that is missing is the song that Marius sings with Eponine when she is dying.  It was so beautiful in the movie, I was looking forward to hearing it again in the soundtrack, but it was not there.  I know a &#34;higlights&#34; cd cannot include everything, but there is a very, very long track, #17, that is all gunfire and instrumental music.  From my perspective, that track could have easily been omitted, allowing for the inclusion of the other two....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|An amazing, suspenseful horror series that feels like you are watching a movie with each new episode and full adventure.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Cute movie. Bought this for my son, we have all the movies to this...good story line, funny, even for the WHOLE family ;)
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Felt deeply involved in each moment and can't wait to see the movie and feel what it is like first hand how it feels to be in the immediate presence of a tiger and share his trip!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|**I just went to the theater to see this movie, but more on that in a minute**<br /><br />This book is absolutely brilliant story telling! I absolutely love buying any of Nicholas Sparks's books because I know that I will get a genuine, unpredictable, entertaining story from start to finish!<br /><br />Each character has a past here, and each one has been given just enough time for the reader to get to know them, feeling as though you can actually picture them, get to know them, without getting off course of the actual storytelling.<br /><br />I try hard not to give away the story by posting reviews by explaining what I love best about the book and why, but I will say this: each book I read by Nicholas Sparks is authentic. Genuine. Full of passion.<br /><br />I just hope that Nicholas Sparks's life is lived with just as much passion, dedication and romance as told in his fantastic books!<br /><br />**About the Movie**<br /><br />Here's what I can say: there is an element of predictability in this story to a degree. A young woman who is married to a severely abusive husband has two choices: leave or stay. That leaves two possible outcomes: either you move on and find true love, it you risk losing your own life living in fear.<br /><br />A widowed father has lost his wife to cancer. He raises his two young children in a small sleepy town while operating a small grocery store by the sea. He either goes on raising his two children, alone, not experiencing love or a life beyond tragedy, or he opens up his heart to knew possibilities and hope for a brighter future for himself and his children.<br /><br />This movie does not disappoint. A few elements of the book were changed, but in this case, the audience wouldn't have had the same experience in the theater as they would have had reading the book at home.<br /><br />I'm glad Nicholas Sparks owns his own production company, and produced this movie. I'm sure he understands that with every book he writes, he wants his audience equally affected by his love stories at the big screen.<br /><br />I went to the theater to see this. At today's prices, it was well worth every penny!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Heard of Angry Birds for a long time it is fun and addictive.  I have at times run my battery to the ground trying to clear a stage.  Had to buy the rapid charger to keep up with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book and gave it a 5 star the story is very interesting and its definetly something some people would relate too
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Perfect for if you have a hard time sleeping in strange places. Easy to operate and a good base selection of sounds. The alarm feature works like you would expect. Get and enjoy ot. Or don't. I'm good either way.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down. I like the author and the way the story was portrayed. I look forward to reading another one of Colleen Hoover`s books.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its so freaking fun!!! I have it on my kindle and my phone and I enjoy it so much! Exciting!
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and of my Late Husbands he would tell me that<br />is where he was going and get everything ready for us to meet again. Makes you think of<br />your destiny.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love Sons of Anarchy, it is a great show. This season it started to get a little soap operaesq but still an awesome show
0525953728|5.0|I bought this book for someone who doesn't have a computer, so I really can't rate it.  She although thought it was great.
B0096BIENY|5.0|If you like the Tenor groups initiated by Pavarotti, Domingo and Carraras, then you'll LOVE these young men and their beautiful voices; the breadth and depth of their vocal range is exceptional, and this &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; collection has 2 CDs--fabulous, popular selections and a great $value!!
034580404X|5.0|Great reading!!!!  As advertised, these were all very interesting to read.  Kept me turning the pages.  Would recommend these to everyone over 18.
1934030198|5.0|If you want technical, you got technical!
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|The style that it was written in made it difficult to stay with the narrative. I felt the section of the cat journal was not necessary. But then it's important to realize that this is written as the voice of a young girl, not a literary work.
B0058DRSHW|5.0|I love business books that are easy to read and engaging, and this one does not disappoint!  I bought it after reading the author's Good to Great, which he described as a prequel to Built to Last.  Both books hold many lessons on leadership that can be applied at any level, and both are well-written, engaging reads.  I find the historical tidbits fascinating!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love a who-dunnit, and this one delivered! Many twists and turns - cheering for a character one minute; then booing them the next.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable read for all who all who are interested in the psychology of a young girl who maybe finds herself.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I'm always asking &#34;who is singing that?&#34;  My wife just downloaded it for me after my hairdresser told us about it.  I look forward to using it.<br /><br />Batt<br />Houston, TX
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I am never displeased by Nicholas Sparks work. He can simply use words to tie into your emotions to make you feel part of the book. I could reread his books a million times.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It must be truly intimidating to attempt a book after the runaway success of the Harry Potter series, and one must add, the unexpected success of the series. Whether it is the burden of these expectations, or whether the author is simply comfortable writing only for a certain audience, the book is unmistakably written for the legion of Potter fans.<br /><br />`Casual Vacancy' is not so much of a novel for adults as a storybook for the adolescents. The author, ever mindful of her target audience and their desire for simplicity, keeps the story about as simple as it can be: good vs. bad. This black and white characterization extends even to the locations: for example the village of Pagford is charming and picturesque; but the Fields that adjoins the village is a dangerous place with drugs and dope peddled openly! Consistent with the theme of keeping it simple, the characters are two-dimensional and true to stereotype.<br /><br />As for the characters, one cannot but fail to notice that they represent the different demographics. It is no sin for authors to be market oriented, but one hopes it is not so obvious.<br /><br />Still, once the book gets under way the story keeps humming along ... after a fashion. Eventually, the book gets undone by the lack of a good story and, at five-hundred pages; the book is likely to exhaust all but the most ardent Potter fans.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A very well written book that pulls you into the world of the author's imagination. I would recommend this one for any fan of the epic fantasy genre
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I like this movie franchise.  Lost of action, zombies, big monsters, and even a story.  This one felt like I was watching someone else play a game but with worse dialogue, and not even playing it well.
B0002GX9IW|3.0|This dvd was supposed to be in great condition but it has a bunch of scratches so it skips. It kind of kills the whole mood of the movie when the screen goes black. I guess that's to be expected with the price though.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I gave these cd's to friends and family for christmas, they all loved it!  I had seen the Piano Guys on PBS and really enjoyed the music along with the video's they perform in.  The scenery is beautiful and adds to the music!  I was hoping to find a dvd with the music and video but it is not available, hope it will be in the near future.  To fully appreciate the Piano Guys, check them out on YouTube!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Subject matter is very blase and the characters are too perfect. . Very superficial story. Will make good beach reading
B004SEUJ46|5.0|I have been watching Grimm on TV. I am really attracted to the Story. This movie was good.Awesome. Fantastic. The writer has a very active imagination.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed the setting of the story and how the author tied the present with the past. She created a suspense and somewhat of an urgency in the unfolding of this secret.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was so detailed and written well, it made you feel like you were a part of the story. I would recommend this book for all ages. It's good for the soul.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book I always wanted to read and this my only chance and it was a great opportunity
B008OOYALE|5.0|great app<br />sloop tu I I. I u h yt g f y y t t t g t t hectic rf
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought it is super fun and its a surprise that it's free. I love how it gives you options of what to do and is easy to play.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Already anxious for the next season to come out!  The Big Bang Theory is our favorite show of all time!
B00005JNNZ|5.0|Nothing wrong with condition of DVD. Exactly what was wanted. The movie is also a great watch by the way.
B0033PSH4U|5.0|A gripping story.  Superbly acted.  Beautifully shot. DeNiro's directorial debut is a stunning masterpiece.  It captures a volatile moment in time with an unblinking eye and a sentimental heart.
B0000V6SOG|5.0|Great mix of music -- glad I got the UK edition so the beautiful instrumental themes were included.  Reminds me of the movie which makes me happy.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|It could have said all it had to say in a much shorter format. It was pretty good though. Why do these directors think we need every scene to tell the story?
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Absolutely enthralling......could not put it down!!!<br /><br />Truly, one of the best books I have ever read-!!!<br />I'm going to read it again.....
B00884GR0W|1.0|This really isn't a rating but just something to let people know that I could not download after purchase even though it said it was compatible with my tablet ( not a kindle)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very well written, hard to put down.  Loved it! I just wish ms hoover had more books available.  very good author1
B00340I4KG|4.0|It was a good movie. alot of people i talked to also enjoyed it. love both actors travolta and cage.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I did not love this book.  I started it years ago and put it down.  I found it hard to get into.  Then enough people have told me how much they enjoyed it that I gave it another shot and really forced myself to read it.  NOT WORTH IT.  By the end I was skimming.  I found it quite slow except for a few moments in the book.  It was only after discussing with someone again that they agreed that some people love it and others, not so much.  My recommendation is if you don't love it after reading the sample, don't bother.  The rest is just more of the same.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the perfect sequel to Temple Run. It is more challenging, but not to to hard. I LOVE IT.
1451695195|3.0|Somehow I had expected much more from this book. I am a physician, myself, and have recently been going through a tragic phase in life, and basically was seeking comfort. I am not convinced that I got this reassurance from Dr.Alexander's book.<br />I do believe he felt he had a NDE, and tried his best to put a scientific explanation to it, but all in all, it missed the mark that I sought.
B001RPIYV4|5.0|Good condition. Great price! Would purchase from this seller again. Movie was as described. Purchased to show freshman English class.
B000002KDI|5.0|What else can you say!?  It's Neil Young...with his band...'captured' live!  Enough said...You gotta have it...You simply have to have it if you truly consider yourself a fan of 'rock and roll'.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Purchased for the family. One of our favorites. We love it! The price was great! Would buy from this seller again.
B00000I14Z|5.0|Awesome effort! I will not bore you with some rambling breakdown of this album by Mingus.  I'll just say if you enjoy 'old school' jazz, then this is a 'must' for your collection...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this game because it was free and had good reviews. I am glad that I got the game. if you love horses you should get it!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I've waited for Clark to release a full project since I first heard his 'EP'.  It was such a tease.  This record did not disappoint.  The next great guitar player.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Being an Irish immigrant, I happened on this movie a few years ago, in the early hours, and on some cable network. It was really wonderful. The acting and the actors were superb. The 2 young girls were awesome if not a bit difficult to understand at times. However, their facial expressions told the story anyway. Sheridan has terrific talent.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Any story that has children trying to discover the past of their parents immediately brings me in...this was no exception.  The characters were well developed, and the love story was told beautifully.  The tragic twists and turns had me wondering until the very end of the book (just like The Forgotten Garden), and even when I thought I knew the ending, I was stil surprised!
B009RH9FR6|2.0|This case covers the Kindle 7 HD well enough but I prefer others.  My son has a Blurex Ultra-Slim Case for his Google Nexus 7 and I much prefer that one.  I was excited to try this case out because of the rotating stand and great reviews.<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />I don't like the strap.  It's more annoying than useful.<br /><br />The rotating mechanism is much too tight.  It's a pain to swivel back and forth and feels as if it will break or tear eventually.<br /><br />I don't like the angles that you can adjust the table to stand at.  None feel like the ideal viewing angle (regardless of tablet orientation)<br /><br />The plastic clips that hold the kindle feel cheap and looser than I expect.  The Kindle has not fallen out yet, but I get the feeling that it will if I am not extra careful.<br /><br />For the price and problems, I would highly recommend searching for another case before buying this one.
B008MM9630|5.0|I like the graphics. The variety of items available is awesome.  The only negative I have is that my sister and I have yet to find a way to add each other as friends. Otherwise, we are both enjoying this game more than all the other games we play.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Egan does a masterful job of pushing and pulling the reader through time and space. Sometimes, a reader can get lost in time jumps and narrator switches, but not in this book.<br /><br />Memorable one-liners abound: \\"I'm always happy. Sometimes I just forget.\\"<br /><br />It's a quick read, but isn't without intellectual or even philosophical merit. That's hard to come by.
B002APU580|5.0|This adaption of the book is STUNNING.  Please stop reading this review and purchase it.  The intelligence, beauty and grace of the people and scenery are unparalleled.  I thought I had seen every possible version.  I was wrong.  It is so amazing to see how our society today has degraded.  In this period and time, there was just a &#34;knowing&#34; of your social manners, graces and the Art of Conversation.<br /><br />When you purchase this, just sit back and absorb the time period and let this movie take you away and enjoy the fantasy.  It is all good from the very first frame to the last credit.<br /><br />Enjoy!!~
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The App has really good graphics, it is appropriate for younger kids and its a perfect app just for kids. I love this.
B004T1Z9S4|5.0|WOW...this movie kept me on the edge of my seat only supposing what might happen next.  A good thriller...and love Russell Crowe...Character had an unlikely plan with a slim outcome....loved it!
0547884591|1.0|By far the worst release by Tim F, who's otherwise great. Huge book, but a good reminder that Quantity does not = Quality.
B004UXY5D6|5.0|Love this CD!! Reminds me of home and where I grew up! If you haven't seen them live your missing out! They are awesome!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I haven't read a Nicholas Sparks book in a while. I did find it to be a little bit slow but found out why that was so in the ending. It is worth reading! I am glad I read it through!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Swag, it's dope and makes temple run 1 eat dirt, it is the best game ever,PERIOD.<br />END OF STORY. It's awesomeness
B003ZDO90G|2.0|A selection of short stories based on daily life in Canada. I'd rather read magazine articles. The title story wasn't about Canadian life and didn't fit with the others at all and although it was based on a true story it was hard to follow and did not achieve its objective. Guess I'm just not an Alice Munro fan...
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is a amazing app it oz one of the best one ive played for a delly long time thank you
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This Lego set is a beast! It kept my boyfriend entertained for 10 hours. I highly recommend purchasing it and basking in its glory of amazingness!

0446560073|3.0|I love the cartoons so I thought I would like the book but it's just not the same.  The book is okay and great for kids but not something an adult would be into.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was absolutely phenomenal! I enjoyed every second of it! This had adventure, suspense, and romance combined and I just could not stop reading!!!!
0446560065|3.0|I love the cartoons so I thought I would like the book but it's just not the same.  The book is okay and great for kids but not something an adult would be into.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Got this game for my 8 yr. old daughter, but find myself playing it more than her!  As a child of the 80s, who kept all her original ponies and castle to pass on to my daughter, I love My Little Pony and the time we spend playing this game together. So cute!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the better books I have read in a long time.  A lot of thought provoking situations.  Complex but still easy to follow.  Makes you wonder, hmmmm!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Was great, I enjoyed it.  I love games that make you think, and this hidden clue game did just that.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|It really winds me up when people just automatically give apps 5 stars without any thought. If they took the time to go through this app they wouldn't.  It's no better at reading pdf files than anything else. The annotation side is OK, but without the ability to export them it's totally useless. You can export to some weird file type and nothing, INCLUDING THIS APP, can read them! How ridiculous is that?! If this was a free app I'd be annoyed, so for a paid app I think it's totally crap.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Looks great, works, and is for sale at great price. I was a little weary because it was so cheap, but tis is indeed a BluRay!
B005LAII3U|5.0|This was a fantastic movie it kept you entertained from start to finish. This movie is better then the original movie Total Recall.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|awesome book, i absolutely loved the story line, the bravery that Erin/Katie had to leave Kevin, and i cannot wait for the movie!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book, easy read, and though I don't like the violence it portrays, is a thought-provoking book. Love the characters and the action of the plot.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Where have I been? Or where has this book been all my life? I remembering hearing about it a little when I was younger and thinking it was fluffy boring stuff, but I love this book! It is now one of my favorites, right up there at the top with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and A Tale of Two Cities! Alcott's writing is not stiff or formal, but rather personable and believable. I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry \\"written\\" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.<br /><br />This is a must-read! It is also an easy read. Do not think for a moment of not reading it, because it is such a heart-warming tale of one beautiful family and how we can all triumph no matter our circumstances and achieve happiness. Love, love, love this book!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I got this app for my husband. He's a big hunter so he's able to check the weather in the different states that he hunts.  I also have the app for my phone too.Love it!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Wonderful to just kick back and relax to or to help bring about an easier more restful sleep each night.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was the first Steven king book I have read and I intend to read anything else he puts out.  I decided to give this a shot because I read everything about the Kennedy assassination I can find (true or not). I found it very hard to put this book down and breezed through the 850 some pages with  ease. I recommend this to anybody who enjoys a good time travel story.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Incredible. filming, acting, plot, and mainly the concept are all exceptional. Not sure how anyone would dislike this movie. of course if your a normal american you wont figure out the big surprise till the end.. Invest in this film!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This Product had the features I wanted for a reasonable cost and did not dissapoint. The Sound quality is very good with the ability to adjust the volume, Bass, and Treble in the Soundfly Unit. There had been some previous reviews complaining about the unit being hard to insert into the lighter socket and even breaking. While I can see how thaat could happen, simply grasping the sides of the unit that inserts into the light socket to do the inserting avoids the problem all together. The tightness in the lighter socket actually makes the unit very stable in the vehicle two Thumbs up!<br /><br />Setting the Frequency worked well and it did not take more that 2 minutes to select a frequency and save it on both my radio and the Soundfly device(up to 4 freq. can be saved).  The remote control is easier to use in regular operation than the controls on the device itself because there are just more specific buttons/functions available. The remote does have to be pointed in a specific direction but is easy to get used to.<br /><br />The display is small but has the basic info that I need to be able to navigate through my folders and songs. I am using a 16G low profile memory card/chip because that is what I had on hand (can take up to a 32G card). I consolidated all of my music onto the card from multiple sources and put the songs/audio files in related folders. I can step from Folder to folder or from song to song.<br /><br />I still have to figure out how to use the search feature and Bookmark feature for the digital audio books and lectures I listen to but the pause and fast forward features work well. I will update the review with more info/feedback as time goes on, but so far very happy with the product.
0345525558|5.0|I loved this book!  It was a nice, quick, easy read.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Highly recommended!!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This movie was Great!! I enjoyed it thoroughly. My husband loves westerns and this was kinda countryish. Lol. We Both loved it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Omg I loved this book just wished it hadn't ended all soon there should be a part 2 did they ever have there child and if there was a part 2 I would run and go gat it and I have asthma lol .
B008BM9L72|3.0|I didn't feel that this book was well written and it trotted out all the usual bland stuff. Beautiful people - i.e. everyone ; all clever,clever people - once again everyone.<br />It seemed just a list of different places to have sex and it just missed being erotic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|well what can I say? I've always wanted a horse and now I've got one. I cannot find the words to express my gratitude. every dream I had as a child came to true through this app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my husband loves this game he plays the levels i go back and try to get threes stars we have lots of fun playing the game together
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The book is an easy read and I like the ending on each chapter because you want to keep reading to find out what happens. I am looking forward to reading more of the Jack Reacher books.
B00280LYIC|1.0|Are there any good book in this entire world? People say me I should read more but when I do the books are so dumb and written by total idiots. How many idiots can there be i ask and then I read this book and find there are many more than anybody can count. this book is so dumb. The kid is a god and what he just forgot that he was and his name is just like that god he is like? I don't get it. Idiots! If you believe this book you are idiot and should puke on yourself. and i see there are many more books just like it and it will never stop. dumb idiots!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Good one kept me reading on and on<br />Dorothy\\"s adventure with her comrades kept me reading I thought four minutes passed but an hour did
B002APS61I|5.0|&#34;Are you laughing at me....are you REJECTING me?&#34;  Nice to have on the fire because you jump to the best scenes of the movie: Mr. Darcy writing a letter, Mr. Darcy and Lizzie dancing, Lizzie's night at Mr. Darcy's aunt... and then, wait for it... the rain scene (awesome), and then Lizzie getting caught sneaking around Pemberley, and finally the wonderful fog scene.<br /><br />I think you can see that, on the fire, this movie can be watched many many times very very quickly.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I am amazed that any person can be so prolific and still capture your attention, in so many ways. I am looking forward the the third volume. The reason for the four stars is in deference to Pillars of the Earth....my all time favorite.
B009329Y30|4.0|It a pretty good movie nothing really special about it but stiil a good movie. Plus Zac Efron is some major eye candy.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I think its great when the Classics are coverted to Blu Ray.  And this is a real classic, fantastic video quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game!  Even beter then temple run. The only problem is that it takes a ton of money to buy new characters and other things in the shop.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I am so excited to have this movie on Blu-ray!  The upgrade was done very well.  It's not perfectly high-definition, but it is certainly MUCH better than the original DVD version.  I have a blu-ray player (obviously) and a 32&#34; high-definition tv.  The picture great.<br /><br />One thing I don't like:  The chapters are broken up so you end up watching the opening and closing credits at the beginning and end of each chapter.  That gets a little annoying when you just want to watch it straight through.
B008QQP34I|5.0|Best of the series.  Brad Bird did a remarkable job directing this feature!  Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast were great as well!  Very entertaining.  The movie also stands on its own, in that you don't need to have watched the others to enjoy or get this one.
0316228532|1.0|I am so disappointed in this book. I haven't even finished the first chapter. I realize that this was written for adults but I didn't expect that it would have so much foul language in it. I don't use that kind of language and don't enjoy finding it in the books I read. I don't plan on finishing it and it will be going into the trash where it belongs. That's too bad because I am sure that it has a wonderful plot and I would have enjoyed reading it. Sad.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|best strategy game well worth the money. I have played it over and over and trying it different ways makes it like new each game. the worm one is the best
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was just as good as Bared to You! I cannot wait for Entertwined with You!!!  Love all of Sylvia Day`s books!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book is well written with love and drama and a twist at the end.  Could not put the book down once I started reading it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Tlhe game is fun, but it freezes up easy. Doesn't really work on kindle fire I did enjoy taking care of the horse. Might work on ipad better
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was lots of fun even though I used the hint button an awful lot! I thought the storyline was interesting and intriguing.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is definitely worthy the price and is a puzzle game with an adorable character named om nom who loves to eat candy!  Overall, this game has no glitches and does not take long to load. So this is a great game worthy of at least four stars maybe even five.  Hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This was the best comedy since Tommy Boy. My wife and I laughed all the way through the movie. This is a must see movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoyed the first Temple Run. But this one I absolutely LOVE!!!!!! I only stopped playing because the battery died on my kindle fire!!!
B003HV0TN2|1.0|I am so glad i didn't buy this book on kindle, because i could at least take my frustration out on the paperback. Kvothe is a narcissist. I hoped till the very end there would  be something i can like about the story but to no avail. Just don't waste your time on it. Oh and don't worry about my hamster...... she also couldn't finish it so she's ok.<br />Someone else said they wish they can give ZERO STARS; I agree.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is defiantly a joy ride. My brother showed it to me and I wouldn't give him his kindle back.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|when I heard this for the first time I was greatly affected. Beautiful music is hard to find these days. I found it with The Piano Guys. i love the new album i bought and so does my father-in-law. the Music inspires me to be good, just as it is good
B001THMIGC|5.0|Nolan has yet to disappoint me, from these less well-known films, up through the blockbusters of the Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception. Memento is a gem of a movie that toys with your head and keeps you on your toes with its two forward- and backward-running story lines.
1576754227|4.0|This was an easy read, very simple concepts, but powerful if you actually choose to heed his advice. I particularly resonated with living within your unique abilities and discerning what part of your work merits the best results.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Could not get through the first two chapters.  The male character is so obviously written by a woman that I did not find this character credible.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wasn't too sure about the game at first but it turned out to be really cute. thumbs up on a great game!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Contrary to my review of Gone Girl, I always find the Harry Bosch Character believeable.  I've always &#34;cast&#34; him as a young Bruce Willis from &#34;Die Hard&#34; though, which does not match the author's description of Heironymous.<br />The last few Bosch tales have been a bit too lean, for me, though.<br />Back in the days of &#34;Trunk Music&#34; for instance I felt there was more &#34;flesh&#34; to the storylines.
B008IJT0CE|2.0|I have this app on my Galaxy Note and my kindlefireHD. I don't sleep without it. When my grand daughters sleep over they always ask for the &#34;moon music&#34; refering to the icon artwork. I have started using it at work when I need a background ambience that is unobtrousive and easily managed. Checking out some of this devs other apps and will be reviewing them shortly.   Updated Review: After a recent update this otherwise wonderful app will no longer work on anything but my kfHD, and it never worked on any of my Fire TVs, nor on my Fire Stick.This is a true failing on the part of the developer and Amazon. Come on Amazon, put a Fire under the dev to come up with a version that will work across ALL my Amazon devices!  Ipnos Software inc, you loss THREE stars until this issue is resolved.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I like quilting so I enjoy the challenge of putting the pieces together to create a &#34;quilt block.&#34; The progression from easy to more difficult is smooth.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Watched the movie and just had to buy it. I got Blueray/DVD for just 7.99. Awsome price.I have Mama Mia too. Fun to watch music scenes.
0684808323|5.0|Better than the movie sums it all up. None of these people would I want to be friends with but a very readable entertaing book.
0811876373|5.0|Nicely laid out. Loads of ideas for different kinds of cake pops. Purchased as a gift but couldn't resist giving it a look through.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|took me a while to join the DA fan club.  a friend told me that i had to get thru the first 4 episodes, then i would be hooked.  totally true
B008TSVZHM|5.0|It's so cute! About the size of a credit card and holds 8 microSD cards. There are spaces on back to write on so you can keep track of what's on which card.
030758836X|4.0|This was my first Flynn novel and I really enjoyed reading it. It held my attention and forced me to read it in about six hours because I really wasn't sure what was going on in the book. Did he or didn't he? This book made me think about my marriage, my wife, and are there really people out there that messed up? Unfortuantely there are, so I am now going to buy Ms Flynn's 2 other books to enlighten me some more.<br />Dom Mosco via Amazon Kindle
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I watched this at a friend's house and love love love it!  I don't have HBO but want to watch it at home. There's not too many movies or shows that I buy to keep but this series is a must have.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|its Bob Marley what else can ya say, If you don't love this, give it a chance it will grow on ya
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I liked the story, however, the author was very repetitive. I  could have been written better. It an okay book.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I chose this rating because I love the &#34;Bones&#34; series.  The quality was excellent.  I recommend the series to everyone
0307383415|5.0|Barack Obama isn't just the ordinary president. He is a distinguished man of endurance and influence, a perpetual symbol of hope and accomplishment for the world. His memoir, Dreams From My Father, takes readers through an insightful journey to his past, unearthing the ways in which he dealt with the looming shadow of his racial history. As a multiracial child born from a white mother and black father, Obama explains his previous struggle to find value in his own racial diversity, which he later realizes was the one mistake that had completely changed his life.<br /><br /> Dreams from My Father is an awe-inspiring compilation of thoughts, anecdotes, and reflections that disclose much of Obama's family history, as well as his own endeavors to retrace his roots of inheritance, from childhood to adulthood. Through his accounts, he successfully establishes a metaphor between his personal life and current society by conveying the message that race should not be the only factor that determines who you are, that there is so much more to everyone than just skin. Brilliantly written, this memoir possesses everything that a good read needs: eloquence, detail, and a heartwarming passion to imbue unending hope in today's generation.
B0053O89IS|5.0|very good quality excellent  I really like the Bones series.  Can't wait for the 8th and 9th seasons<br />Five stars
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy finding things that I love and having a place to keep them where I know they won't get lost!!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Great quality and price.  I enjoy the &#34;Bones&#34; series.  Couldn't wait to view it.  I recommend the show to all my friends.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book is amazing.  The first book I liked, but this one I absolutely love and can't wait to read the next!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Finally a book that proves that near death experiences are not based on biological happennings but spiritual happennings. Read this book and grow in your faith in God and heaven.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|A lot of fun for all ages. Can be a challenge for all ability levels. Lots of songs to choose from.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I like the movie and soundtrack, that I wanted to get the CD.  It was worth it, I listen to it while driving to work.
0316228532|5.0|I got the audio book at the library for my 2 hour daily commute.  This brutal tale of seriously flawed characters fumbling their way through small-town life is honest and heart-wrenching.  The almost completely self-absorbed adults in this novel let down the adolescents and children in so many ways, all of them possible in today's self-centered world.  I hope there is a follow-up so that some of these people can redeem themselves.  As far as the writing goes, each character is so well-developed, that I feel like I know them personally.  Tiny pieces of information that could be meaningless are brought to life in unexpected ways.  This book was excellent, and the audio was exciting and well-performed.  I couldn't wait for my day's commute to see what was happening next!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I have read the books & now listening to the music, I remember/think of the parts of the book it belongs with. Out of all the songs/music on the CD, there's only 2  I can do without. Love it
B008VBYN80|2.0|It's okay.there is no real problem with its adequacy as an app<br />Word word word word word.<br />More words,, language language language
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wuthering Heights is a Emily Bronte classic and no matter how many times you read it, it is always spectacular.
B000TDGGVU|5.0|This book explores what many have been thinking for awhile---too much of anything is not necessary beneficial. People in general seen to be more anxious and demanding and a large contribution is the many minute decisions that have to be made, from choosing which type of chocolagte chip cookie to purchase to doing &#34;research tho choose which flat scree
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a wonderful little gem of a book, or should I say books! I stumbled across this on Goodreads and decided to give it a go, but was disappointed to find that it wasn't available at my local library. It wasn't even available by request from other libraries. So I put it out of my mind. But then I got a Kindle for Christmas, so I made this my first purchase because the price was affordable and I wanted to try it out. I can't tell you how pleased I was with this book!<br /><br />I've read another self published novel so I was expecting something amateurish, but this was slick and polished. I like the author's concise style. He says what he needs to say, sticks with the plot, develops the characters without veering into the endless rambling that's so popular these days. For a post-apocalyptic book, it's not dark or nihilistic. It's not sweetness and light either. It's gray, just like the real world.<br /><br />I recommend you buy the Omnibus edition rather than the individual books, and not just to save money. While the first book is a neat little self-contained story, the rest really hang together into one big story arc. Book 2 in particular would be disappointing as a stand-alone, but it's an important transition from books 1 to 3. Please buy these books and support this author. He says his books are  inexpensive because he's not well known, but there are plenty of new unknown authors out there spewing garbage priced 5X as much. I can't wait to see what Hugh Howey does next, and I'll definitely be buying the sequels!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The Kindle is such a blessing for an avid reader on-the-go, especially with today's weight &amp; space-controlled flying. Saving even more luggage weight &amp; space is the White Noise app. I used to have to tote a special white-noise generator...now I can just use this app on my Kindle. Love it!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was so captivating..full of history and great facts. Very clearly written as various characters were presented into the plot. A great read for students as well as anyone who needs to know the usuage of cancer cells by hospitals and other medical facilities, without knowledge and/or compensation. A solid story based on facts !
B00023BLXK|1.0|Nothing like the original... Corny (in a bad way). If you're just looking for good dancing watch youtube videos from SYTYCD (that's what I do because I can skip the annoying commentary from the judges AND don't have to watch a lame movie).
B003O86FMW|5.0|BOOK 2 still keeps you on your seat.  Could not put the book down.  Can't wait to get into BOOK 3.
B004BDJS9Q|5.0|I think perhaps the incredible style and plethora of references make this movie lose it's charms for those who didn't grow up in an 16 bit world. This is a compelling personal narrative told through a lens of surrealism and a must watch for anyone who grew up with Mario.
B000002B9I|5.0|Excellent Purchase... This cd is perfect for anyone who loves great music... I highly recommended this item and this seller... I love it!!  :)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this game is so much fun. but they do ask you to spend real money pretty quickly. would probably like more if they changed that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game. I would definitely recommend it. I think it is an awesome game. All of my friends want it.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book is up to the usual Patricia Cornwell standard.  A really good read.<br /><br />I don't like to write a review with a required minimum number of letters.
B000002J0G|5.0|You know, even though I haven't been listening to them for that long, I LOVE Testament! They are one of the only thrash bands that stayed consistent in their playing from when they formed to the new album, Dark Roots of Earth. In addition, Testament riffs and solos were far better and more progressive than Metallica or Slayer during their root years (in my opinion).<br /><br />Low is an especially good album. It introduced a much thicker death metal vibe on the instrumental end, while Chuck Billy beefed it up in the vocal section. Really, it's just brutal.<br /><br />I ordered this product with regular shipping, and while I was a little disappointed with the wait time of a week and a half, I still consider it a timely manner. Plus, the CD was in perfect condition upon arrival and inspection, so I'm generally happy about it!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The sounds are clear and very realistic. This app is the best in terms of quality of noises. Ive used other apps like this to fall asleep to and I like this one the best. The cat purring and the thunderstorm are two of my favorites.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has to be one of my very favorites now! I really like romance and thrilling novels. With \\"Hopeless\\", I get both!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I get so lost in this game, totally worth the price for a moment to escape your reality ... headphones a must
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing!!!!!  If you liked the first temple run, you are definatley in for a surprise!!!  This game has really good graphics and missions you can complete for coins to upgrade.  You can also collect coins.  I RECOMMEND!!!!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Lots of action and treats the Batman theme with a new twist and with a somewhat surprise ending.  you will enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game to play and have. Very realistic and entertaining. It's very informing and it keeps you learning new things.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|If you like Clint Eastwood and are afraid that this is just a movie that shows and old guy still making movies then you will be surprised this is a great story and has a neat ending.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was GREAT it kept me reading until like 2:30 AM! It never stopped the action always keeps you wondering what  is going to happen next!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the Weather channel, I am a weather geek, I have it on more than any other channel, I live in a area where the weather can and does change at the drop of a hat and I lilke to stay on top of it, so two thumbs up for the Weather channel.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|A great read with plenty of excitement throughout, as soon as one book in the series comes to a finish you can't wait to start the follow on book.
044661758X|3.0|A good read....entertaining.  This is about par for this series and a bit predictable, but I  can't turn away a Connelly book.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A very good read with a story that does a good deal of twisting and turning before reaching an unexpected conclusion
B00005K3NR|4.0|Carrie (1976) is a tragic film; one with insensitive high school students who torment a shy and abused girl who subsequently uses telekinesis for revenge. It has elements of a horror film, but I don't consider it to be in that genre. This movie has some darkness to it, but is mostly about the whole high school student mentality and some adult intervention. While watching this film, I would be lying if I said that I wasn't rooting for poor Carrie. It's a shame her crazy mother wound up stabbing her; this outcome wasn't what I wanted, of course. It would've been nice to have a different ending, and perhaps more happy, or at least have Carrie survive and make a sequel. The thing that doesn't work too well in my opinion is how Carrie goes from this sweet girl who feels like she's gaining momentum and confidence while attending the prom to a person who's determined to turn the school into a fiery and bloody inferno. In other words, it transitions too fast. I say this because for the first 75-80 minutes, this film isn't of the horror genre. It SUDDENLY becomes a horror type film when Carrie gets mad. Still, this film is a solid one, and it definitely kept my attention throughout. I understand what Stephen King was trying to accomplish with the tragedies: he wanted to depict Carrie as someone not of this earth, and give the story closure. And what can I say about Sissy Spacek other than that she's one of the greatest actresses in Hollywood, and her performance was outstanding. Her emotionless face covered in blood during the gymnasium destruction scene is memorable and chilling. I give this film 4.5 stars, and consider it classic.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A great book in the series, each book tells a good story. Some of the place names and people's names are another thing and take some digesting but  it is set in Sweden so it keeps it all very authentic.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|American Reunion is a surprisingly good film after the very shaky American Wedding before it. Here, the gang gets together for their high school reunion, and while most have grown up, some (Stifler) hasn't taken that plunge yet, and in typical fashion, alienates the people around him. In the end, he lends his perspective during his friend's troubles, and is seen as actually mature, all the while maintaining his obnoxiousness. Oz is his sentimental self, and dad (now a widower) attends Stifler's party and winds up with, well........use your imagination!! Meanwhile, the climate was set for Stifler to get revenge against Finch with, well.........Finch's mom? Am I spoiling too much here? All in all, this film is entertaining and draws the viewer in like the first 2 films.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Between Life and Planet Earth, I wouldn't be able to say which is better.  If you're going to get either, the David Attenborough narrated versions are the best.  That man could read from the phone book and I'd still buy it.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|There are so many to choose from. Sometimes its a little overwhelming to pick just the right one. Can't beat the price (free) :-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing this....it is different then most games and you get a variety. Have had no problems so far.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Not quite as happy with it since original purchase. it is great for my 5 yr old, but it freezes up and has crashed already. the idea is great, but the technical issues are very annoying. also, in order to advance you need to connect to a social network and invite all your friends to play, which is NOT necessary for a 5 yr old. it would probably be more appropriate for older children in that sense, however it is designed for younger children.<br />all in all, not really worth it
1423140605|5.0|I love this book so so so so so so so so  so so so so so so very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love it. It is very funny and very little bit of boredom,and the first time in my life I almost read the whole thing laughing.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you love her cd's, you will love this dvd! It gives you a behind the scenes look at the influences for her writing and a great look at her personality.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is so easy to get an idea of what today and the next few days will bring for weather.
B00846REIS|5.0|Felt like I was somewhat on a roller coaster ride reading this book but I still enjoyed reading it. Gideon Cross is so hot.
B000FVE3BG|2.0|We returned the watch.  Although we loved the color scheme, the face was way too big even for a man.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Downloaded for my Kindle fire this am. 2 1/2 yr old can't get enough of it. He sees the boat and plane and wants them but is having great fun with the trains. I love that no ads pop up. Even though he only has the Kindle while He's on my lap I dislike the pop ups opening the web up while he's counting or something. I love this app. Will look forward to more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.I always wanted my own horse and by playing this game it makes me feel like I'm actually outside playing with it and competing against other horseback riders

B0082RHRHC|4.0|So glad I chose to read this classic again.  Wish there had been an audio option when I read it the first time...35+ yrs ago!  CliffsNotes didn't do it, me, or my grade any justice.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|Indeed this game is defiantly recommended to people who play Plants vs Zombies but they're are also some glitches... for example , it freezes constantly and it some times screws you up by constant glitches and bugs
B009TSA6YE|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Mr. Michael Schenker since the 70's.  I have no hesitation in saying this video and audio recording is beyond what he did in his younger years.  Through all that this man has been through, to record this is beyond inspirational.  He has always been and will continue to be one of my al time favorite guitarists!  Bless, you, MIchael--you are an amazing talent and distinguished studied musician--please keep up the wonderful music you have given us all.

B00884GR0W|1.0|I downloaded this game when it was free, and was immediately thankful I didn't pay for it.<br />Being an avid Minecraft player, this game seemed like an extremely early alpha of Minecraft.<br />I don't suggest paying for it.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|If you are an aspiring Entrepreneur, then this is almost a must read for you. If gives you great tips, with stories to go along with it. However, there is not much of a &#34;story&#34; to it, mostly tips.<br /><br />If you are an aspiring Entrepreneur and are looking for some tips and stories then this is a great book for you! However, if you are just interested in Entrepreneurs and want to hear a big story about them, then this is obviously not the book for you.
B0086700CM|3.0|the game is fun (And frustrating). I earned points and purchased wallpaper, but nowhere does it tell you where to go to view or apply. :-(
B004HWT6DO|5.0|This movie is very well done. It shows the rise of the world's youngest billionaire and how he made his company/website what it is today. Even if you are not entirely interested in that aspect of &#34;The Social Network&#34;, which I don't know how you couldn't be, then there is still a good story line for you to follow along with.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is perhaps one of the better Grisham attempts at a good story with plenty of surprises right up til the bitter end.  I didn't want it to end.  Although the idea that one could acquire $8 million dollars in gold and live to tell about it is a bit far fetched but it makes for a great tale.  I especially liked to characterization of the Feds and how silly they looked trying to do their job.  Hopefully in real life they are not as bad as they looked here.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because you get to take care of your own horse and you also can get other horses.

0984380213|5.0|I can't believe this book was only $10 because there are some million dollar strategy that I can see myself executing.  It's definitely worth every penny and more.
0525953728|5.0|This book was one incredible read, Owen takes you to the Bin laden raid right from the get-go when his Helo \\"Chalk One\\" crash lands into the compound.  next, he tells you about an elite group within an elite group DEVGRU which comprises the best seals from the best teams.  Many SEALs try out for DEVGRU every year but not all make the cut and they are sent back to being \\"normal SEALs\\" even though there is nothing normal about that.  In the book, before he goes into the Bin Laden raid, he goes into a couple other raids that him and his team took part in, including HAHO jumping into Afghanistan, jumping into the Indian Ocean for the Maersk Alabama, and going on a surprise attack on Taliban Fighters in the Hindu Kush Mountains.<br /><br />  Overall, I was very impressed with the book,  what surprised me most about the book was that not all SEALs can get into DEVGRU, you have to be the best of the best of the best to make it.  Owen covers every detail about the missions that he participated in almost to painting a gruesome but assuring picture.  He goes into detail about Bin Laden when he came up to the third level and started firing on Osama.  Later when taking pictures, he describes the body with incredible detail that would make normal people grimace.  I was slightly disappointed with some of the writing however because I would have liked to know more about some of the missions he was in and what his role was but that's understandable because many of these missions could still be classified.  He makes it clear though that their mission was not to kill Bin Laden but given the circumstances leading up to the third floor entry, when Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti started shooting through the door that Owen and some of his other teammates  were behind.  Owen himself taking some shrapnel to his shoulder but still carrying on.  I was also surprised by how many things went wrong on the raid itself.  Starting off, the helicopter carrying a dozen SEALS crash landed but the pilots very skillfully landed it on a retaining wall; it may have been just sheer dumb luck, it could be a mix of skill and luck, but nobody really knows for sure.  next, there were failed breaches for the other half of the teams to get in so that delayed the mission further but the SEALs still pulled the combat part of the raid itself flawlessly and nobody was seriously injured, except for the four males living in the building of course.  overall i highly recommend this book and give it five stars.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book ...well series is awesome I recommend it to everybody. I read the third book first but you can still make sense of it.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|We enjoyed this movie as much as we did in the theater!  It is a total family movie and has some great lessons to teach!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Ok this game is great but hard to get used to.like when sonic the hedgehog had his old lovable self on Sega and he used to be in the green hill zone made of pixels.that's how this game is temple run is sonic pixels and tp 2 is like the new 3d sonic with the green eyes and the walking around and the lazy attitude .bottom line it's a good game and that's all that matters.

089381525X|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest collections of photos of all time. The introduction gives a powerful and almost poetic in its style overview of the images in this book. Sebastiao Salgado has captured the work environments that so many millions of workers have endured. The photos are a strong social documentary at the same time as being outstanding works of art with their lighting, composition and subjects. So many incredible moments are caught. An absolute must for anyone interested in photography or society.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I would really recommend this  book to anyone who has a stomach for adventure. Be warned,it gets bloody on MANY occasions.  It is a hard read, but I think it is an amazing book, and the best I have read for awhile.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great drama,  what all tv should be like. Looking forward to watching the rest, and catching up to this season
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like this alarm clock. It offers a variety of different sounds for the alarms, shows me the weather, it even lets me change the brightness. This alarm clock is really diverse and awesome.
B009EE6PTS|4.0|This movie is definitely worth watching! it's not a feel-good flick, by far, but it had my husband and me engaged the entire time.<br /><br />The problem we had, though, was with the sound quality. We had our television turned way up and still had trouble hearing. This is a common theme for streaming video we've watched from Amazon, unfortunately.
B0051BVQFG|4.0|This movie is great summer popcorn. Not sure why it got the bad rap. Marines, aliens, and a pretty cool \\"on the ground\\" filming style. Semper Fi!
B005LAII62|1.0|This is supposed to be a fun, qwirky, cute childrens movie, but it's anything but! After just under halfway through this movie, my child was horrified and I took it out. It's like someone got drunk and thought it might be cute to make an animated version of
1594487154|5.0|I've read dozens of books on sales and influence, and written a couple of my own. IMO, this is one of the very best. What makes this book important and unique is that it draws on the latest research in sales and social sciences. Dan Pink has written a fascinating guide book about the practices, attitudes, and psychology of sales and influence. Along the way, he debunks several commonly accepted ideas about what makes people successful sellers and influencers. Not only is the book eye-opening, it's very entertaining. I highly recommend To Sell Is Human to anyone who sells, influences, or manages salespeople.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|So, I thought this was another alien remake kinda movie but it is actually very interesting. In the beginning, it was kinda slow but it picked up afterwards

1419703692|5.0|My daughter bought this as a gift for her brother (our oldest son) who is an avid Dark Knight fan.  (His younger brother bought him the blu-ray Dark Knight trilogy, so he was &#34;set&#34;!)  This is an excellent book with a lot of interesting pictures and details on how the movie was filmed; behind the scenes commentary; etc.  It's good-sized (a coffee-table book) and weighty, but will likely be a &#34;keeper&#34; for all fans.
1451695195|5.0|I purchased this for my Mother to read and she has read it at least 3 times.  She is constantly commenting on the content
B009X01ELC|5.0|Yes, it's a little pricey - but so is it's chief rival.  The difference?  Thickness and quality of construction.  If you're looking for the thinnest profile that affords a degree of protection, then go for the &#34;Amazon Kindle Fire 8.9&#34; Standing Leather Case&#34; and save yourself about $5.  It's decent; comes in a variety of color options; and won't add much to the weight or bulkiness of your KF, but it may not &#34;stand&#34; as well as advertised, nor &#34;protect&#34; to the degree this case will.  Aside from one or two minor details (that admittedly are probably owing to my own pickiness), the Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for the Kindle Fire 8.9&#34; is arguably the best on the market.  From the environmentally thoughtful packaging to the quality of materials and construction, this is one nice case!  The leather looks and feels luxurious; and the rotating feature makes it quite versatile for reading or watching movies/TV shows.  The cut-out detents work well and offer a variety of viewing angles.  The minor &#34;details&#34; I mentioned?  There are three (3):  1.) Be careful to hold your thumb over the non-hinged end of the KF, else it can &#34;swing open&#34; if positioned in such a way that the weight of the KF plus gravity will allow for the panel in which it's contained to swing free.  The KF won't fall out, but if you were reading in bed, could swing down and hit  you in the face if you don't hold the panel on the non-hinged end.  Marware could (and should!) easily remedy this with a velcro feature.  2.) The elastic strap functions fine for holding the case closed, and seems to be reasonably well made.  I hope it's sturdy to hold up for the long-haul.  Some sort of more pronounced closure device (e.g. magnets) might have been more helpful here.  3.) I like the charcoal grey color I purchased, but would have liked having an option for a navy blue one even more.  Again, just my preferences.  This is a great, well-made product, and I'm glad I purchased it.  Furthermore, given the same selection of cases, I'd purchase it again.
0307887960|1.0|I continue to be amazed at the amount of people who embark on this diet. I would have thought common sense while reading this book would send alarm bells in readers heads that this diet is ineffective in the long term and downright dangerous.<br />Sure you will initially lose weight (from restricting calories) but by no means is it healthy to follow this diet. I could almost guarantee if you begin this diet today, a year from now you will be heavier.<br /><br />I was so dumbfounded by some of the comments made in the book I began highlighting them, one of my favorites being \\"diet sodas are often the best way to make sure you drink the 1 1/2 quarts of liquid.\\" After stating this he does mention Diet Coke which makes me think he may be paid by them for his comments.<br /><br />He also admits later on in the book that \\"your wonderful strong determination from the early days suddenly makes way for bingeing followed by a return to drastic dieting, creating a chaotic yo-yoing situation that soon becomes dangerous\\" which is exactly what will happen.<br /><br />Mr Dukan may be a doctor but he could by no means call himself a nutrition specialist. Use your common sense and use GOOD nutrition and exercise to lose weight.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Oh man. I got this book as a Kindle sample a couple weeks ago and loooooooooved it. It intrigued me from the start. I hated the main character but at the same time couldn't decide if he was innocent or a crazy murderer. Either way, I wanted to find out what happened to him and his wife.<br />Part Two wasn't quite as good, but it's an enjoyable contrast to the first part. (I can't say much more without giving away the plot. I hate spoilers in reviews.)<br />However... Part Three? It felt like the author wasn't quite sure how to get to the ending she wanted, so she forced the characters to do things I would never expect them to do just to get to the end. The entire tone changed. It was honestly very disappointing.<br />Would I recommend buying this book to someone? Eh, I'm undecided. I'd suggest checking it out from the library and then getting it for real if you like it. For me, while I kept it, it wasn't necessarily something I HAD to have on my digital shelf.
0714834491|5.0|It's a great book for anyone in the creative jobs business or who is just curious about stuff. I recommend it to students with the proviso that, if they don't get it at first, just keep it around and it will \\"reveal\\" itself when they're ready to receive its special message. That's what happened with me. I buy this book often to give as a gift to friends and relatives.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love the characters, love the writing style and love the story.  Keeps you wanting more.  I had only planned to read a couple of chapters, but couldn't put it down and ended up reading the whole book in one evening.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It took me a little longer to read this book because I kept losing interest. It reminded me of a movie that you watch, that's just too long...and just won't end. Could have wrapped up the series better, felt like she just bailed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game Eva! I always wanted a real horse but this makes me feel like I actually have a horse I love it!!!!!
0307744434|3.0|\\"The Night Circus\\" by Erin Morgenstern is an interesting book about a subtle game being played, hidden in plain sight, at a fantastical night time circus.  In the book, Morgenstern paints almost poetic visions of a circus experience that is without equal and beyond belief.  This book will make an absolutely beautiful movie.<br />Unfortunately, the book is somewhat less successful than I expect the movie would be.  Morgenstern introduces us to interesting characters and situations almost immediately in the book, but after our introductions, the book slows down to a snail's pace.  The first half of the book is almost a labor to read.  Complicating that, the chapters for the first three quarters of the book are not necessarily in chronological order.  You could be reading a chapter that takes place in 1896 and then the next chapter could take place in 1903 and then the next might be back in 1899.  It makes for a difficult read.<br />To Morgenstern's credit, the book ends very solidly and the last eighty pages or so are terrific.  There are no real twists or shocks at the end, but it is very satisfying nonetheless.<br />Anyone who will press through the first half of this one will be rewarded in the end, but because of the book's slow start and the confusing time jumping, I can't give this one more than a three and a half.<br /><br />On a side note, major kudos to whoever designed the cover art for the book.  I've read hundred's of novels and I've never seen a cover that more perfectly fit with the book.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I purchased this book about 3 weeks ago and I has thus far changed, improved, revitalized my workouts. This is a quality book in my opinion and easily worth the $7-8 I paid for it. I would recommend it as a resource to a friend if asked.<br /><br />I've been working out on and off for the past 15 years I'd say and this is the first time I have seen actual results in the gym. I needed to take it to the next step and get informed and this book is my first tool. It has been a very good tool and I am working on my second read-through. I really enjoy my workouts now. Before I was lifting too light of weights and spending way too much time in the gym. This book has helped me simplify and direct my workouts very well. This book has also given me insight and perspective on the way and how I eat. It is a very good book and an easy read. I recommend it for sure.
1611748755|5.0|If you like books on CD this is a great one to listen to. The author is very imaginative and the story is very unique.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I am on my 3rd or 4th read through this book. This book paved the way for me through a very deep and powerful depression. This book has helped me learn about my relationships with every important person in my life, most notably myself. This book has helped transform my own perspective and has helped me develop a sense of direction and has given me hope. I am no longer depressed and this book was not a fast, quick fix but a disciplined approach to actual problem solving, not just making this all better (which is what I thought I wanted). If Dr. Peck was alive I would thank him for this book and his perspective and guidance. Again, this book changed if not saved my life and has helped me develop into the man I want to be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game! I reccomend this game to people who love horses. I have not been able to stop playing since I installed the game. big fan!!!!!!
B00AVASSZ8|5.0|José James is one of my favorite artists of all time. A voice like no other, gorgeous lyrics,  impeccably crafted songs of heart and soul, cherry picked musicians on the record and at the show. Eclectic and not stuck in a music box, yet committed to each expression he is not a toe dipper- he puts his whole foot in and that's why it's so good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|An emotional roller coaster that is impossible to put down.  I love everything Colleen Hoover writes!  The characters are beautifully developed.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I love animated movies, so I looked forward to Brave and wasn't disappointed.  The plot was a new and different type of story, and I got caught up in it right away.  Animated films set in Scotland are not common.  The young heroine, Merida, won my sympathy right away, and I wanted her to come out on top.  All in all, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, even for a 79-year-old man.  My only complaint was that some of the dialogue in the Scottish brogue was very difficulty to understand.  I would recommend checking to see if subtitles are available on the DVD.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I was delighted to discover Lost in Austen. This twist on BBC's interpretation of Jane Austen's masterpiece is a sweet surprise for any Austen lover. It is best appreciated if the viewer is first a fan of the book and BBC's epic starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I say this with respect, as I count myself among their ranks: This may disappoint, or even irk, literature snobs. I, however, love the satire and fully believe it's in the spirit of Austen herself, who has long been celebrated for her cunning and biting wit. This is a new favorite!
B007N6EUHI|1.0|I bought this app in anticipation that it would help me with more detailed anatomy. Especially the bones. Unfortunally it was very basic and I found it to be entirely useless.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I read this book solely because I fell absolutely in love with the cover.  I know you should never judge a book in this way, but I think The Night Circus is an exception to that rule.  The story is masterful and intriguing with a fast pace and beautiful dialog.  The characters of Marco and Celia jump right out at you and while you may begin the sorry rooting for one over the other, you will soon find yourself rallying for both, together.  I loved the mini chapters in which the writer takes the reader into the circus, guiding us through tents and beckoning us with the smells of caramel apples and cinnamon whatsits.  The romance is eloquently done and the trial, which focuses on magic and illusion, feels so real that you'll suddenly wonder if it's your real life that's the imaginary one.  Judge this book by its cover; you won't regret it.

0743233832|5.0|This is now my favorite book.<br />Don't buy this book if you are shallow minded, for you will not appreciate its profundity and dismiss its wisdom as trivial and nonsensical. This a guide for life and its pursuit of happiness and real self fulfillment. Combine this with the ideologies if your religion and lifestyle to fulfill your own Nirvana.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|my only problem is that the game never stops so I cant get any sleep or my stuff will spoil
B003YUC2FE|5.0|My husband of all people is a big Disney & Pixar fan and even though we don't have a Blue Ray player, I thought this was pretty cool.  We have the treasure chest displayed on one of our TV stand.  A little pricey, but if you use all 3 (including computer copy), it's a pretty cool deal.  Fortunately, my son was able to use the Blue Rays.  This was one of the few box collections I could find as well.

0062502174|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of Paulo Coelho's best books, IF not the best.<br />The book is about everybody's long search for fulfillment, which comes with spiritiaul awakening and not, as we erroneously think, with material possessions and power achievements.<br />The book is for those seeking spiritual guidance .... for those interested in spirituality and the awakaning of our inner guide, our soul.<br />For the above reasons, and some more personal ones, I think this book is a wonderful addition to anybody's library - - material and spiritual!

B005SAY404|5.0|...that hasn't been said by better writers in better reviews?<br /><br />It was never about the medicine for me. I never cared very much whether the medicine or medical procedures were accurate. I'm not a doctor of any kind so even some glaring mistakes probably flew by me unnoticed. I usually didn't care overly much about the guest patients or their illnesses, either, although there were a few I liked. I also liked only 2 or 3 of the diagnostic team members enough to be interested in their own separate stories, but more often than not I resented the times when a supporting character was featured because more of \\"them\\" usually meant less of Hugh Laurie. And that's what it was always about for me: watching Hugh Laurie blow my mind week after week, year after year, playing THAT character. The only other actor/character icon I can think of that was as big and impressive was Alan Alda playing Hawkeye Pierce in the '70's. And frankly, I think Hugh is the better actor; Hugh was actually creating a character that was NOT like Hugh Laurie in any respect. Alan Alda as Hawkeye, by about the 3rd or 4th season of M*A*S*H, was basically playing himself under the name \\"Hawkeye Pierce.\\"<br /><br />I will miss watching Hugh play House. I will certainly look forward to watching Hugh play other characters in other projects, and I will relentlessly hunt down every recording of every piece of music he's ever played, but I will miss watching him create House.

1401322786|4.0|Man alone chimes the hour. Wonderful Mitch Albom writing, as usual. The message is: There is a reason God limits our days. To make each one precious. Time is not something you give back. The very next moment may be the answer to your prayer. Ends are for yesterdays, not tomorrows.<br /><br />Sarah used the expression: Time flies with you. The book really makes you think about time: Ahead of his time, pass time, waste time, kill time, lose time, in good time, about time, take your time, save time, long time, right on time, out of time, be on time, keep time. There are clocks on the mantel, computer, phones, DVD, watch, fax machine. They come in the style of alarm ringing, grandfather, kitchen, cuckoo, in shapes, tick tocking loudly, pocket watches.<br /><br />There is a line that says: Please make it yesterday when Papa came home. It was insteresting, as he says. Children normally don't ask to revert time. They want the bell to ring and a birthday to arrive.<br /><br />I enjoyed the hip writing when Ethan writes about Sarah hitting on him. His friends reply: That's what you get for being nice; U plus Sarah equals gross; see movie, he's just not into you; that butt's too big, bro; knew she was a skank; run dude; isn't she the science geek; never be nice to psychos; she's delusional; too bad Ethan. Sounds exactly like what bullies would say.<br /><br />I think Mitch always does his homework.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|One of the best movies we have ever gotten. The music, the quality--is beautiful. I cant say enough about this movie..it made Christmas SO much more special...Our 3 yr old loves and it..and we DO to.. SO its a family movie we will never get rid of for sure!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The plot of this book, a man left alone on Mars, is truly fascinating. I certainly thought he was a dead man, but he used good scientific reasoning and an engineering 'MacGyver' knack to survive. I have had engineering training and found his description of his tasks at hand and his solutions, truly amazing. Although, I think parts were overdone and could have been shortened. Overall, I would recommend this book to any SciFi fan.
B00021HBGS|5.0|Our son loves his sticky bath toys..Come with a nice little hangup bag to put in the bathtub--so if your an organize freak like me they all stay together. Product is great and so far havent noticed any decaying or molding that happens with bathtub toys often!
B009X01D9U|4.0|I love this case!  It is very easy to use and the rotation feature is great!  It makes it easier to hold and balance.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love it on my Kindle fire.  use it as my alarm clock everyday.  I have it set for different times depending on my crazy schedule and it never lets me down. use it at home and on the toad.I have it programed to wake me with a playlist stored on my fire which is much better than a buzz. cressendo feature is great. wakes you gently rather than shockingly.  I set mine for Max vol of 75% which is plenty to wake me up pleasantly and not disturb the neighbors.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another Clancy book that takes several side stories and brings them together into an exciting read. Once you get into this book you cannot put it down. Audio sync did not work as well as advertised. Not worth the extra cost.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My little boy absolutely loves this game and he can't get enough of it!  My husband even played it once and now he is addicted to it!  I have not had any problems at all with this app.  Awesome game!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is probably one of the best movies to come out in the past few years. It has the same goofiness as Sleepover, Step It Up, and Glee. If you're a fan of any of these or just the type of genre, this movie's for you. Watch out for the language, though!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent story<br />Is now one of my favorite Stephen King books!!<br />Up there with Shawshank and The Body and The Stand
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great second book to the Hunger games trilogy. I also can't wait to read Mockingjay. Suzanne Collins is maybe the best writer of the decade I think.
160774273X|5.0|After 30 year exclusion from baking bread, a divorce and coming from a family of chef's and pastry bakers, I found Ken's book outstanding. Luckily I had all the tools on hand and found the instructions and logistical aspects of his recommendations outstanding. I am on now on rigorous rhythm where I bake picture perfect bread. Again, simply adhere to his instructions for the basic bread and you'll have a solid foundation to grow on. An awesome book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so fun! This whole MINECRAFT thing is very new to me... And I have not learned it inside out yet and I keep dying...but I am smart. I will figure it out. If you like building,  destroying,  and staying alive,  this is the application for you.  :D
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Reminds me of Mario Brothers, many levels, different goals and power characters. Earn points for more power.<br />Tony Gonzalez tweets that he plays.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is a great series!! I am a big fan of the books and was very happy to see that they fallowed so closely to the books.  Any fans of the book/show should also check out [...]
1442337966|5.0|This was a great gift!  So inspiring and uplifting. I am a Christian and found it to be in line with scriptures and God's laws!  God is LOVE!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I hate myself for admitting this, but I personally hated Temple Run. Temple Run 2, however, really caught my eye when I saw it on the Android Market. I was amazed how much of an improvement this was over Temple Run. The scenery looks much more colorful and appealing than the original, the sounds have been recycled from the last game, though. Temple Run 2 is much more challenging than I thought, but still, I'd highly recommend Angry Gran Run.
074356619X|5.0|My daughter told me to buy this and I am so glad that I did.  It definitely will give you tools to change the course of your life. I didn't need the &#34;new age&#34; music and some of the quotes but overall it's good stuff!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Great game to keep you busy. Great graphics and nice story line. Only negative is you have to buy full game to get the complete experience.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|the only thing I don't like is that u can't charge while propping up the kindle in this case. I wish they put the charge hole on the side but otherwise it's a great case.
B001E45XT4|1.0|I bought this in april and it didnt even last till sep. I sit here reading reviews and can only assume other commented before theirs had time to break. They are EXTREMELY tight to wear, but you can handle it. They are made of really cheap and noisy plastic, which you can look past. They don't extend very far, but again you can handle it. All these things I looked past, but then they just stopped working. I was pretty much in shock being as they cost close to 100 dollars, which makes no sense because you can but a 20 buck pair that feel, sound and fit better. If you are looking into buying one, I would say pass, from what I read online they ALL seem to break. It only has good reviews because people can't wait past the day they open to box to review. Be WARNED
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Does the trick - simple design. Originally bought for a male, but the kindle has migrated to another family member.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think for being the last book it was the best because it all comes together you see everything from another perspective and it just keeps drawing you in to read more. Excellent book.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best free app for the kindle fire hd.  I've had my kindle for 4<br />months now, and this app is the only one I check every day!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|ok so I charge my kindle for the night and it wont come on in the morning. we finally get it back on and it had reset subway suffers. my 45 hoverboards gone. my 32000 coins gone.  and this is the second time it has done this!! fix please
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Not significantly different from the re-issued 'Live at Leeds' ( except from the exclusion of 'Magic Bus'), 'Hull' is still a welcome addition for Who fans. The fire, fury and, yes , mistakes are all there. All of the playing is top- notch, and Keith's drums are really mixed front and center. Even the accompanying booklet is an interesting read to see how this project came about.
B00B19F3PG|4.0|A different twist to this type of genre makes this a great movie. Similar to many others that proceeded the exorcist, this was a refreshing approach to the story line and gave me a laugh or two. Just the right amount of special effects combined with great acting. Even though it was a bit predictable I would recommend it those who like a good scare.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|It was interesting and gave the interest to read again, love this book so intense as always been any Bram Stoker book.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It's worth the watch if your a fan of the actors. Don't expect to be rolling on the floor but there are some good slap stick antics and story lines. They do a good job of bringing Ted to life so it seems he is real as you get into watching him. Plot is not too bad as Ted has to move out so his owner can get married. It's worth a look and you'll get a few good laughs. Not for kids but a bottle of wine or your favorite recreational drug will go good with this flick.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game worked a couple times. but after I play another game and then tried to play it again it quit working. now it starts to load and then cuts off
B007SUW24W|5.0|Great new artist.  I cant wait for more works from him.  Very mellow sounds that doesnt blare right at you.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Anyone who is even remotely curious about what it would be like to live in the DPRK needs to pick this book up, you won't regret it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the third book I purchased on my Kindle Fire.  I loved it so much and couldn't put it down!
B007N85POS|4.0|I like it but it is a bit difficult to use on the Kindle because the Kindle is so sensitive.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the first book I purchased on my Kindle Fire.  I loved it so much and couldn't put it down!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|This was the first CD I had bought from the band, I regret not buying it sooner, these guys are great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was the second book I purchased on my Kindle Fire.  I loved it so much and couldn't put it down!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Perfect for my Kindle fire.  Easy to use.  Totally satisfied.  I now use my Kindle over my laptop to check mail.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was a little slow in the beginning.  By the middle of the book it started to pick back up.  It did answer a lot of questions that were left hanging from the first book, but then at the end if made you wonder What is going to happen next between Eva and Gideon.  I can't wait for the third book!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really a fantastic read. Suspenseful and thrilling. I really enjoyed all the detail that went into the solutions. at one point I started to feel like I was \\"getting the formula\\" but it passed quickly, and I really I never felt like the author was jerking me around. The characters are great and pacing just right. really a one of a kind book. I ws really impressed with how much practical science the author was able to cram into such an entertaining story. Bravo!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|made me laugh out loud a lot it so nice to have  movies at my finger tips thanks amazon for making that possible :)
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Just started reading the Reacher stories I enjoyed the writing style.  Having to write a certain number of words is stupid and I will not rate or review anything else I get from Amazon.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tina! this book made me even love her more! she is great at what she does and inspires me to work even harder despite all the obstacles in life thanks Tina!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's unusual for there to only a slight leap of faith to absorb, such as a time portal, in a Steven King book, but the character development is, as always, exceptional and the telling of the story kept me up to the point that I was tired at work for two days in a row. If you like Steven King, read it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Well written kept me guessing! and definately coudn't put it down although it was a little violent than i expected other than that very good read!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It started out strong but the ending was a letdown. Almost as if the writer ran out of ideas. Dissapointing
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was well worth the price. I couldn't put it down. The ending was a surprise. I like a book I can't guess the plot line twist and turns.
0553103547|5.0|This book is amazing. If you love the show, this book is for you!! The show follows the book pretty well!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this bookI thought it was just anther Teen Romance, II'm happy o say I was wrong.  Sky and Holder came to life through this book and I ecame completely engrossed in reading.<br />I am happy to say the book is not a \\"Wam-Bam-Thank you mam\\" book. Nicely written a few typos, but didn't stop m from finishing the book. So Thank You Colleen for a great book.
0061692034|1.0|I guess if you are awarded a Pulitzer you can get away with anything, no matter how ghastly it is.  I recommend you read Part 1 (there are 3) and if you haven't thrown it against the wall by then you're a masochist of the first order.  An interesting story line gets you this far but then it goes berserk. It's an appalling book telling an appalling and ghastly story.  Run!
