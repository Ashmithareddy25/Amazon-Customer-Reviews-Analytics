B00005JMJ4|5.0|I really liked the visual imagery of this film. The script was very nuanced. I watched it a second time and enjoyed it much more the second time around.
B002VWNIDG|3.0|Stephen King has inspired two kinds of movie adaptations -- the ones that are brain-meltingly bad (\\"Dreamcatcher\\") and the ones that are considered quite good (\\"Misery,\\" \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\").<br /><br />\\"The Shining\\" is often considered to be the best adaptation of King's works ever, primarily because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick. However... it's actually a pretty terrible adaptation. A very chilling horror movie -- if excessively slow for the first four-fifths -- but it has little in common with King's story. Also, a good man turning evil is less suspenseful when he's played by Jack Nicholson.<br /><br />Teacher-turned-writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) accepts a job as the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a luxury mountain resort. He figures that since the Overlook is completely cut off by snowfall in the winter months, it would be the perfect time for him to get some writing done.  His wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) is eager to stay at the overlook. but his young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) is having premonitions about the Overlook.<br /><br />Why? According to the chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), he has the \\"shining,\\" which is basically any psychic abilities that the plot should demand. Unless you're an African-American man, in which case they will go on the fritz just so you can die. Movie cliches must be maintained!<br /><br />At first, the Torrance family seems to be enjoying themselves -- Jack has plenty of time to write, and Wendy and Danny are able to explore the giant hotel and hedge maze. But Danny keeps seeing disturbing visions of creepy twins, \\"redrum\\" and rivers of blood. And Jack is quickly falling into the sway of the Overlook, becoming more violent and vicious towards his wife and son...<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind about \\"The Shining\\" is that... well, it's a TERRIBLE adaptation. Had this movie been made by Joe Director instead of the great Stanley Kubrick, it would probably have been despised for how much of the original novel was discarded -- in particular, how much of the supernatural elements were cut out completely... just so Kubrick could insert his OWN supernatural elements.<br /><br />It feels like Kubrick liked a one-sentence summary of the movie (\\"Writer stays in a haunted hotel with his family, goes insane and tries to kill them\\"), but had contempt for the original story (presumably because it's mere pulp horror). This gives \\"The Shining\\" a peculiar unevennness -- some parts are pure King, others are pure Kubrick.<br /><br />Taken purely on its own merits, \\"The Shining\\" is an excellent psychological thriller -- lots of icy, eerie atmosphere, with pale light and cold, echoing rooms. Kubrick fills every scene with a feeling of tension building just under the surface until it erupts into blood and screams. The story is rather slow-moving until the ax-swinging climax, but Torrance's legendary rampage is definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />However, the casting of Jack Nicholson was a mistake. Jack Torrance starts as an ordinary man, but is slowly devoured from within by his demons and resentments. The problem is... Nicholson already looks evil. He ALWAYS looks evil. He is incapable of NOT looking evil. So when he is turned into a sinister cackling lunatic by the Overlook, it doesn't really feel like much has actually changed.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is pretty solid, though -- Duvall gives a fluttering, weepy performance here, but she does give the impression that Wendy has some guts. Lloyd gives a decent performance as Danny, and Crothers is waaaaayyy underused as the kindly psychic chef... who inexplicably can't see Jack coming. I still don't understand that.<br /><br />\\"The Shining\\" is a very good psychological thriller on its own, but ends up feeling uneven and weird because of the bizarrely unfaithful way it was adapted.

B0030B624E|5.0|Love this movie! Not into the whole &#34;zombie craze&#34;, but the movie's not actually about the zombies.<br />It's a fun little romp focusing on friendship, family and what matters.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I am primarily working from home, with hours of telephone conferences and web presence appointments every single day. After my Plantronics wireless headset's batteries gave up, I gave the G930 a chance. After owning it for a little more than one year, I can honestly say that is the worst product I have ever owned.<br /><br />It started out great, good sound, convenient microphone mute by just putting the mic arm up, around 6 hours of constant use without charger, capability of being charged while in use. However, after just a couple of weeks, the microphone mute sensor broke and the headset was constantly muted. Getting support from Logitech is worse than dealing with the DMV - it took me 4 calls and 7 e-mails (over a week) to acquire a RMA number for a warranty repair. Please also note that, despite of the high retail price of this headset, they send you a replacement AFTER they have received the defective product - I was out of a headset for 12 days. Anyway, the replacement arrived brand-new, however, every 15 minutes the sound cut out for around 20 seconds and the headset was attempting to re-acquire the transmitters signal (blinking LED on the transmitter). This got so annoying after a couple of days that I decided to have this item returned. This time Logitech was less than cooperative and insisted on sending the headset back for their own defect inquiry. After more than two weeks without a head set they concluded, surprise surprise, that the headsets receiver circuitry was broken and I got exhibit #3.<br /><br />This replacement also came brand new, had good reception but it shut itself down a couple of times a day for no apparent reason. In the middle of a telephone conference, background static gradually increases in volume until a high pitch is the only thing to be heard, and ultimately, the headset is shutting itself off. Trying to switch it back on again does not work, the green LED flashed for five times and the thing is off again. The only \\"solution\\" Ifound is to connect it to the charger for around 10 minutes and use a needle to reset the headset. It will work for a couple of hours after that.<br /><br />Logitech wasted my time by connecting me with a \\"support engineer\\" who had me run chores like checking the battery is fully charged, relocating the transmitter from one USB port to another, resetting both, receiver and transmitter, trying to use another micro USB cable for charging, purging the driver software, etc. By the time I ran my chores, the warranty of the headset expired and, good job Logitech, I have yet to get any reply (at all) out of them.<br /><br />For me this company and there products are non-existent from now on. I paid a significant full retail price on a supposedly high-quality product and was utterly disappointed by customer service and product quality. If you expect more of your headset than occasional gaming, buy something else.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Okay, so I'm an LOR fan and had high hopes for this release, but my first viewing left me very disappointed. Subsequent viewings have softened my initial reaction, though. I think it is a bit heavy on the battle scenes--which, after all, Peter seems partial to and does so well--but it still retains some sense of the humor and silliness of the book which set it apart from The Trilogy. Bilbo is well casted.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Get it you won't regret it!!!!!!  I watch this series at least a couple times a year and it really never gets old.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was skeptical that the movie could begin to do justice to the book, but this is a phenomenal rendering. It is a visual delight and very true to both the story line and the mood of the book. Well worth a watch.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chosen this 5 star rating I love the  wimpy kid series and it was a good book to add. 5 star
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I like buying box sets. These movies are great to watch. Box sets are easier to keep together and store on shelf.
B00999DFP0|5.0|The dvds were good quality! The packaging was good. We love the show! It's Big Bang! Need I say more?
B004HW7JMO|5.0|umm  i wanted to buy the season  and it meet all of my standards when comparing it too the show
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I went to bed reading this book and woke up planning the hours in my day so I could finish it. No spoiler alert here, but I didn't see the end coming.
B000MDDSB8|5.0|Love the Movie. Saw it in theaters a long time ago. Very interesting since its about guy witches and not chicks. If you like this read the wicked series by nancy holder. Very good!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Will Robie, government assassin, has a routine mission that turns out to be anything but routine.  A target he won't kill and a teenage girl that he has to try and keep alive make this a very intense read.  One of Baldacci's best!
B0082Z447U|5.0|This is a masterpiece worthy of Dickens or Poe.  I am wondering why this classic is not more widely known. I was enthralled and seduced through all 685 pages.  There were times I kept wanting the writer to cut to the chase, but of course one must accept the conventions of the time:  high drama and much verbiage. But oh what glorious verbiage!  And the characters were finely etched.  The psychology expressed, and the feminist viewpoint, are most remarkable, even in our own time.  I found it torturous to get through some of the more gothically suspenseful moments, but well worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an amazing game for all ages. The game is fun and addicting.  I LOVE THIS GAME! I'm positive you will love it too!
B0009VBTA0|5.0|Great CD,download was easy with Cloud player and sounds great. No computer sounding download. Would download from amazon anytime. I would recommend to anyone. This helped me through college while studying for test. its great music as well as soothing to the sole to open up your mind and brain waves. Andreas Vollenweider is one of the greats in New Age music. By far his greatest songs
B008X8QCTO|1.0|Not happy with this game at all, it keep freezing and wouldn't let me pass certain areas...I wouldn't even give it 1 star, but I have too...I have paid 99¢ for games before and they were awesome, but over dissatisfied with this one.
B00C061I3K|1.0|I heard this the FIRST time, when it was called Kraftwerk and done CORRECTLY, without relying on Auto-Tune and other terrible computer effects.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I almost stopped watching the movie because of the first five minutes  -a reaction shared by several of my friends of all political and artistic beliefs.  It is a major sin to insert the director or producer's 21st century perspectives into a historical work.  But the balance of the film is so good that it makes up for it.  It is simply riveting; the performances of Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones in  particular demand your attention.<br /><br />Spielberg produces a lot of mindless (and badly written) fluff but when he decides to get serious he is excellent.  I highly recommend the movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazing!<br /><br />Pi's story, unlike the mathematic symbol after which he's named, has an amazing ending, but the opposite is true for the parallels this book draws with the unanswerable questions raised by the everyday struggles of the human condition we call life. The philosophical questions raised are limitless.<br /><br />One of my favorite books of all time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app!  I use it every day.  I was always losing my paper lists, which is seriously frustrating! With Evernote, I am able to make a list on my PC or Kindle Fire and have it available wherever I am.  I adore the check list feature, which I use daily.  Evernote is helping me to become more organized!  I would highly recommend this app for everyone!
B00594XOZU|4.0|Wow this is a great app and it only freezes up for 4 seconds before I refresh it and get all my messages. I can talk to my friends whenever and there is no payment which makes it all the better! I recommend this app for people who are not allowed to get a phone but want to be able to communicate with one another. I wish there were more settings for the kindle fire kik because I can't change my name. Great app!
B001N18HOG|5.0|Mandatory for any Peral Jam fan. Very good package. I recommend. I like very much the additional tracks from Ten recording sections.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you are a child of the 80`s you will greatly appreciate this book fast and fun read. Caution you will hunt through your basement for old Nintendo Atari Sega consoles and games to play. Very nostalgic loved it!
0547572298|5.0|PKD thought Ubik held special significance. That's what made me read the book originally. It's definitely strange and full of the themes that PKD loved to explore: unreal reality, life and death and the extraordinary feats that ordinary people are capable of. The book later influenced much of the Exegesis, so if you're into PKD this is one you can't pass up!
1846551455|4.0|I read an earlier work of Jo Nesbo and to read the first in this series was a must for me. This is where we're introduced to Jo Nesbo and his absorbing character of Harry Hole. I learned so much about Sweden and the different locals there and in Australia. I am confident if you like murder mysteries you'll enjoy this book!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I love his books and this is no exception.  Characters are likable and believable.  A good read.  Plot got a little messy.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I thought it was well done.  My only criticism is that the producers opted to divide into three parts spread over several years.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I don't buy full albums much anymore, unless I'm confident it'll be more killer than filler.  This one definitely fits the description, great music from start to finish.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Good game. Nice story line and good graphics. Kinda short tho for the money. A free sequel would be nice for sure!!!
B0034JKZ86|4.0|We really enjoy this movie and the music as well. It has a nice story line. You're kids will love it!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The fact that you don't wind it or replace a battery is acceptable, but it seems to constantly gain time and I have to reset repeatedly. Will gain 5-7 per day.
B000002Q7Y|5.0|This Kansas is very different animal than the 70's version of Kansas. With Steve Morse on guitar it is obvious something would have to change. Many things are different about this album. Most notably the lack of the signature violin. Power is one heavy guitar laden album. It is very powerful with more of a pop metal edge to it than previous Kansas Albums. A lot of Kansas fans panned this album but if you listen without expectations and an open mind you will find one powerful albums. Considering this album has a 5.99 list on e-bay and you can pick it up new for as little as $1.60 from amazon re-sellers what have you got to lose! Great music at a great price, Grab it now while you can get it so cheap.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!  Artistry is great!  The story was amazing and unusual!  Never expected the end so got a little down thinking that it would be a different ending.  SO happy!  It is something I watch again and again.
B00005JA2B|5.0|This is the album that made Kansas a household name. The one that gave them Carry On My Wayward Son that Elusive hit they had been struggling for on the previous albums. Up to this point Kansas had a cult following and saw marginal record sales. But with the release of Leftoverture they solidified there position as one of the great rock bands of all time. This album is truly a masterpiece that belongs in Kansas Collection and she be there for fans of prog rock. One of the quintessential albums of the 1970's!  This on rock album that belongs in your collection!
0788812807|5.0|Was in a skit for Senior Games (55+ once a year program) and needed the Siamese cat some so I could sing it for the other seniors.  Fun!  I still have a lot of VHS tapes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't put it down! Love this game. Very easy at first but the levels get harder and more challenging as you go.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|nice movie something a bit different from your typical adventure movies, had a nice plot as well as nice and beautiful scenes. I def. recommend it!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|If you like games where you build your army and conquer this is the game for you, however con gain may be slow and electricity may be seen as a constant drag.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Who knew that two teens from completely different backgrounds could click and then provide the reader with such a compelling story?  The characters are finely crafted and believable, even though their lives are worlds apart.  The conflicts that Eleanor and Park face separately and then together as a couple also smack of real in a world that often mandates its occupants fit a prescribed mold.  My only complaint, and it's  the reason I couldn't give a five star rating, is the motivation of some characters:  Park's father puzzled me, and I could have believed the nasty stepfather if I had some background to his evilness.  Otherwise, this is a book that young adult to young adult at heart will enjoy reading and discussing.
0765325950|4.0|I have read and re-read the novels in the series, and mr. Sanderson did a fantastic job taking over after Robert Jordan's death.  I thought the ending tied everything up quite well, but still left room for ancillary story telling in the world if he ever wanted to go back.  Mr. Sanderson is a fantastic writer, and I honestly felt this book was one of the better written ones in the series, but... After so many years of waiting for the books, I am just glad we are done.
B0009X7664|5.0|Well transferred DVD of this classic Motion Picture starring Gregory Peck.  The Black and White Photography is clear, and the additional commentaries are interesting for those interested in learning more of this story, which happened to be Gregory Peck's favorite role of all the many motions pictures he starred in during his long and memorable career.
B0058BI896|5.0|Every episode is over too quickly however if you are not &#34;binge watching&#34; a season like I did with this one.  It's one of those comedies that rates re-watching and is often funnier the second time around.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Her story line was great and I not only saw them on the big screen but also got them for my library so I would have them for my grandkids, then my kids, grandkids etc etc.  To pass on from generation to generation.  Great movies
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I watch this movie at least 2 times a day. I enjoy how Sherlock is so smart and the partner ship with the doctor is funny.md
B007IV11PM|5.0|I love doctor who and this didn't disappoint.  I want to rewatch them all now.  The new doctor is great
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is the second game in the Cut the rope franchise.  It follows in the original Cut the rope and brings much of the same game play mechanics to bear.  The game has many levels to keep you playing and there is an impressive list of achievements you can get so that you always feel you're progressing.  The game itself is a physics-based game where you try to collect some stars (between 1 and 3) and get a piece of candy on the screen into Om Nom's (the green monster) mouth.  The game is fun, easy to pickup and play for a few minutes and great for both younger audiences as well as adults (though young children might find the puzzles get too complex too quickly for them.<br /><br />Overall, a great game and fun to play.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is so fun I have been waiting for a game and searching for a game for 3 months and I finally found one that I am interested in I would say to get the game because in my opinion this.......is.......FUN!!!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Fruit ninja is a game where you use your finger to cut fruit as it flies across your screen.  It's fun and easy to play; but challenging enough to keep you playing.<br /><br />Sadly, it seems this has been updated to have ads (in the paid version) and it asks for a number of permissions that seem unnecessary (getting info about other running programs, ability to put alerts on top of other apps, knowing your location, etc.).
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is really fun just like the computer version you can't stop playing  it like a magnetic and you can also play multiplayer with other people but it has to be on the same network you can build anything my little cousin like play this game
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is easy to use,  fun to play,  and free!  Highly addicting and challenging I recommend this without hesitation. Players who pay have a slight advantage,  but serious players can easily. overcome this barrier.  Overall - 5 stars!
B000001DU5|5.0|I bought this for my friend who LOVES Tears for Fears!  It has all of her favorite songs on it :)  Perfect gift for her!!
B000F1IQN2|4.0|(SPOILERS)<br /><br />About the film, Munich, I was confounded by some of the ideologies, terrified by the expressed potentialities and convinced that those drunken 'Mericans were intended to represent CIA interlopers.<br /><br />Like the rest of mankind, I have a limited knowledge of actual events. Only historically and then only after some of the filters have fallen away, might we know what these individuals and governments were up to, went through, and to what degree/end they succeeded/failed. For political action films, my initial attentions focus on the realities of physical events (devices, vehicles, locations) and the acting (characters, dialogue) not my perception of the truth at the time I am viewing.<br /><br />Only recently have I learned to withstand my own predisposition to believe that \\"...based on actual events.\\" means anything. Unless it is a first hand, objective accounting of a single perspective backed up by unedited documentation - it is fiction.  To call it \\"a memoir\\" or \\"based on a true story\\" is just a disclaimer. Here is the simplest truth: someone fabricated a storyline and wrote it down.<br /><br />Many reviews decried the freelance killing of the Dutch houseboat woman. While brutal, it is among the most realistic death scenes, ever. The subtlety of her reaction to having been shot, the manner in which she made a semi-conscious rationalization to leave the room, then defaulted to a familiar action (approaching the cat) the decreasing abilities to function that resulting in her with finalit, but as though she was only short on alternatives, visit a necessary chair. It was a wonderful scene, acting-wise. And yes it was horrific. One thing I noticed is the number of comments about the shooters \\"reloading,\\" them \\"shooting her again\\" and then leaving her exposed. Unless there are several cuts, I saw a third man perform the \\"coup de gras\\" and then after one of the original shooters closed her robe, the third man brazenly uncovered her again and said, \\"leave it...\\" or to that effect. All the whining about nudity, grace, fairness and decency fails to sway my opinion that it was very well acted.<br /><br />This film and those like it are about reality; bad people in a grossly mismanaged geopolitical world. (Wake up! Yes, it's a mess, and no, I couldn't do better at picking up after their droppings.) Those whose sensitivities are disturbed by the violence of political drama must to take some responsibility. Either do a little more research into what you choose to watch, or stop complaining about how the big mean world is being depicted. On the other hand - one might stick with fantasy...For instance, 1950's musicals or U.S. prime-time network television...the truly mindless stuff of life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if anyone noticed that the game is lag free and it is excellent in survival mode then this game is awesome, clean, and no bugs like the Pc. version
B00021HBGS|5.0|My 2 year son LOVES any type of vehicle: car, truck, airplane, helicopter, school bus, motorcycle, scooter. These have it ALL along with the road. My son is not a fan of the bath but since getting this, he wants to take a bath all the time to play with his vehicles. And the bag it comes in actually sticks to the bathtub !!!! Useful to dry out before putting them someplace else besides the tub. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|Great stuff from Daft Punk. It sounds like Pink Floyd or Queen at spots. Not in a bad way, but I wanted Daft Punk not possible hat tip songs to other old bands. Some songs are great, other are a little disappointing. Others are good. Glad to hear new music that isn't a movie soundtrack.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game. very fun. Definitely something good to do while commuting to work or even if you have a spare five minutes here and there.

B0091REZMW|5.0|Ignore all the shiners. The only way you'll ever want to use real money is if you are not good at this kind of game and you run out of help tools.
B00005J79J|4.0|Sarah's voice is a delight! But there were so many songs omitted from this \\"greatest hits\\" that it should not have been called a greatest hits- or a best of! It is grossly overpriced-I bought new thru the marketplace (because my Amazon's price was just too high) and paid nearly $16.00 total with shipping. That really soured the whole purchase because it should've been a double cd with at least another 10 songs on it! And it could have been because she released many more worthy songs during that time period! My advice: pass on this one &  buy the complete cd s that were released during that time frame and you will be much happier!
0684803356|5.0|Who am I to comment on the prose of Ernest Hemingway? How can I add to the other 390 people who have read \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\"? How would you like to read Ernest Hemingway's own words? Hemingway gives us a rare opportunity to understand the nature of his writing in the book, \\"Ernest Hemingway on Writing\\". I am sure that Hemingway did not intend his private letters to become public but this reader is thankful. \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" places the reader in the moment because of Hemingway's intent. Listen to his words about story: \\"Make the story so real beyond any reality that it will become a part of the readers experience\\". Listen to what Hemingway says about place: \\"Convey Everything, every sensation, sight, feeling, place, and emotion to the reader.\\" Listen to his belief in character: \\" I want them to sound as though they really happened.\\" \\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" is only 127 pages but conveys a old fisherman's entire world: \\"Prose should read easy and simply and seem short and yet have all the dimensions of the visible world and the world of a mans spirit.\\" Hemingway pulls us into the story by his detailed description of the old mans boat; \\"The sail was patched with flour sacks and furled it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.\\" Many months have passed since the old man has proven his skill while other; \\"successful fisherman of that day were already in and had butchered the marlin out and carried them laid out full length across two planks with two men staggering at the end of each plank.\\" Everything in the olds mans life began to lack purpose and fiction filled in the gaps; \\"There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of rice and fish and the boy knew that too.\\" On land the old man was just an old man but in his boat he was transformed; \\"They were strange shoulders still powerful although very old and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much.\\" The sea gave him hope; \\"The old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave great favours and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them.\\" The great fish lived in a world unknown to most except the old man; \\"Nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple formalized iridescent gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating close beside the boat.\\" Death of the great fish was near and; \\"He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and light lavender.\\" If you love the spoken word and want to be transported into the world of an old man and a great fish, \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" is a must-read. Classic prose never gives up its richness to passing years.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first, thinking this was going to have a cliffhanger but I'm happy I bought it. This book is so realistic. Real people, real problems, real thoughts.  Funny and sexy all at the same time. There is not one complaint I have about this series. No scratch that. I have one. When the heck is the next book available?
B00CW665VI|5.0|You will not be disappointed. This book exceed my expectations.  I loved the fact that it was narrated by the male POV.  It was funny, witty, clever, and kept me up all night wanting for me.  Good job Emma.
B00BVYKWJI|4.0|Liked the mini-series. You have to suspend your disbelief regarding a few points in the plot, but otherwise quite entertaining.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Requires critical thinking and planning to solve the numerous puzzles.<br />Fun and mildly challenging. The little monsters are pretty cute and fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Lovingly crafted. Beautiful look, atmospheric, challenging. I only wish it was longer, but until the expansion comes out in summer, the existing chapters are worth every penny.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love it, but very limited with coins and slow.  Maybe get more coins or as speed it up a little.
B00BIK06JG|4.0|After some months, I've realized that I use this cover 95% of the times.<br />I had another case (LowePro Edit 110) which allows me to carrry some accesories (batteries, filters, charger etc) but it is significantly bigger, so this one although a little bit more expensive makes sense for daily use.<br />Elegant (looks like leather) and with the perfect size (just for the camera).<br />Only problem is that as I have my tripod quick release device attached to my camera,  I'm not using the provided attachment (that comes with the case).
B007C3TVNA|2.0|If you are happy with your life, do not watch this movie.  Nor if you are depressed.  I cannot in good faith recommend this film to anyone.  Tilda Swinton as a broken shell human being, John Reilly as a cheerily oblivious father straight out of the Ward Cleaver playbook and Ezra Miller as their sexy, mesmerizing yet psychopathic son all inhabit their roles completely.  How can actors bring such extreme characters to life without changing themselves forever?  The short answer is that you cannot.  Miller has said in interviews that he suffered nightmares throughout the filming of \\"Kevin\\" and still gets confused, when very tired, about whether or not he has actually massacred people.<br /><br />The fundamental problem of \\"Kevin\\" is the script (a trail of culpability which I suppose would lead back to the book; I haven't read it).  Kevin is so completely evil from the moment of inception that he has no moments of humanness, no glimpses of tenderness, despair or doubt, nothing that could possibly allow us to understand or sympathize with the character.  He's not a boy so much as an incredibly malevolent automaton.  \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" is a bit like saying \\"we need to talk about Satan,\\" but the son of the morning, at least, used to be an angel and offered some useful ideas about keeping human beings in line.<br /><br />Watching \\"Kevin\\" is like spending two hours in the company of a dementor:  It sucks all the joy and hope you've accumulated over the course of your life right out of you.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|We ordered various sets of seasons 1-9 and this one was the slowest to get to us, even though others shipped media mail as well it took twice as long for this dvd to get to us.  Otherwise, well packed.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Cool movie, lots of action, great for movie night or any time you feel a bit of action is needed in your movie time.  MUST SEE!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game I can play it for hours. the only thing I don't like is that It doesn't save anywhere other than your device. so if you delete the app everything is gone
B005LAIH2W|5.0|One of our most played movies, love the whole concept.  Easy to get into and love the past, present and future all mixed together.  A Great Movie!
B0072GPQNG|4.0|very good movie. we purchased this on a waiting list before they finally were released. Excellent movie. we don't usually purchase movies but we decided to buy this one.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played, fast and fun.  We play during the time I cook and in the night before bedtime.  Fast and fun for all ages.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm not one that plays point and click games, but this one got such good ratings I thought I would give it a try. I have to say this was a really good game. The mechanics of the game ran so smooth. You could rotate the screen,zoom was very good. Graphics were excellent,and it had a good storyline. This was a very enjoyable game. I would highly recommend this game.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I really like this version of the Snow White movies, it has a real human touch of the dark arts.  I was very happy with this movie and would say its a great movie for any collection.
0671801511|5.0|Agatha Christie is still the queen of mystery writers. And this particular book crowns her whole Oevre for s uspense. I'm glad I could buy it to complement my collection.
030758660X|5.0|This book has a lot of really good patterns, and ideas for the knitting person in your life. I love it because of the easy to understand patterns, which create some nice pieces to wear.
B00B23O96A|5.0|We all know how GREAT Clapton is, and this CD is just another example of what the man is capable of !!!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|A good movie, not what I expected so a better movie than I thought it would be.  A must for any alien lover.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|After seeing Joe Bonamassa live and playing his acoustic guitar, I had to get this CD and am I ever glad I did !!
B004SIP88Y|5.0|This is another movie which fills your action needs, great to watch and easy to get into the plot. A perfect movie to chill and relax too!
B008JFUOWM|1.0|If you have seen one of these, you have seen them all. The usual collection of meatheads creates filler scenes between unrealistic stunts. The film basically has team GI Joe versus team Cobra fighting over COBRA's weather dominator. Nobody is in jail. The dead rise from the grave. They spend about half the film trying to convince everyone how great Michelle Rodriguez is and how much we should care about her being back. Oddly enough, it was in many ways a better GI Joe Movie than the last GI Joe movie.<br /><br />Vin Diesel just needs to go away. Dwayne Johnson is overexposed, always plays the same character in every film he does and is getting really annoying. They provided paychecks to lots of supporting actors for no particular reason. They seem to have brought back a couple just to show them how unimportant they are now that Michelle is back. But the films have proved that none of these people are important at all. Any of them can be killed or brought back at any time. They are just filler.<br /><br />The post-credit scene is an i-don't-care moment. They fill us in on events nobody remembers from a film few liked. Then they roll out the new bum of the week for our loveable meatheads to crush next time. ....And this time its personal! Other things I didn't like were the lingering shots of certain actors, the stunts looking more silly than ever before. I keep thinking that they will do something interesting or come back to something more real. But I dont think it will ever happen now.
B002I9Z8B2|2.0|This version is edited! Why did they not use the Director's Cut for the blu-ray transfer?  At least three good dialog sections are cut out of this blu ray.  I think it is even shorter than the theatrical release.  Paramount was looking for the quick buck.  :(
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|No one would've thought buying a car charger for today's devices would be so complicated. Many 1A chargers out there do not charge at the full 1A for iPhones and 1A simply doesn't work with iPads. Most chargers for Android devices do not charge at full speed because those chargers do not have the two middle pins shorted.<br /><br />This charger is the answer to those problems. Full speed charging for both Apple/Android tablets and smartphones.<br /><br />This product should be in Apple stores and all cellphone stores across the country!<br /><br />There is ONE tiny problem. The nipple/tip of the charger gets stuck occasionally and does not pop back out and causes the charger not to charge. An easy way to solve this is to apply very tiny amount of grease or WD40 on a toothpick and apply it at the base of the nipple where it retracts. Problem solved.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Lots of fun, puzzles can be tough, especially the key puzzles.  Take some time, rotate the puzzle lots and Don't be afraid to use your lens
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I have to admit, going into the theater to see this movie, I had really high expectations after the first JJ Abrams  Star Trek movie, but I was sadly disappointed.  The plot is recycled and almost too suspenseful for its own good.  I understand suspense is a crucial part of these films, but the way it was handled here is just too heavy handed.  Adding to that, we have the \\"terrorist\\" theme of the film, which although it is timely, doesn't exactly fit into the Star Trek universe evenly.  Without giving up spoilers, I have to say I was not pleased by the blunt way in which the conflict between the \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" was handled.  I had hoped for at least a little more than the scant hint of moral ambiguity which the film offered.  All of this combined makes for an unfortunately uninteresting attempt by J.J. Abrams.<br /><br />All plot points aside the only reason this film doesn't get a 1 star review from me would be the fleeting moments of brilliance in cinematography.  Some of the shots are simply beautiful.  They're well composed, striking, and memorable.  While the whole film isn't so impressive in that respect, there are moments where I found myself genuinely in awe of the actual pictures on the screen.  The CGI is of course amazing, as you would expect from a big budget studio film, and it's made extra interesting in 3D.  The film's length and blunt story telling are too much to overcome, and while the film is plenty \\"cool\\" and \\"neat looking,\\" it's simply too long and pandering for me.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It was a very good deal!<br />Very good pack, BD quality really good, excellent price.<br />I recomend it! I just love it!
6305128952|5.0|How many times have I seen this movie? Four times, maybe. And it still fascinates me. Because &#34;Horse Whisperer&#34; tells more than one story and the stories told are being developed before a spell-bound audience via light, sound, scenery and script in a sensitive, yes even a compassionate way. In the beginning, there is tragedy, loss of life and a crippling accident that inflicts a horse and a girl, there is perceived guilt  -  by both the girl and the horse and, indirectly, as a 'collateral' damage, also by the girl's mother -  that entails a long road to redemption. On its way, it features the pilgrimage to the horse whisperer  - the true catalyst of the story of redemption -  a woman's hasty flight from her former life and into a romantic fly-by mission, a man on the verge of losing his family and an extended family in danger of losing its linchpin as well as its soul. It all comes rife with genuine emotion, thrill and suspense galore. Robert Redford, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Sam Neil, Scarlett Johansson develop the individual, tangled stories in the flesh most magnificently and in gripping fashion one by one. It is perhaps the most harmoniously acting cast of top performing mimes and directed by one of their own kind, Redford, in commensurate form. Here we have brilliance suited to outshine many a contemporary  -  for decades.
B008PWUWLC|5.0|Love it !great protector for my Kindle, looks cool and the grippy bottom sticks to just about anything to stand up for easy reading!
125000098X|4.0|I thought this series was going to be a trilogy, so I am glad there will be more to come. This is not deep reading, the characters are pretty standard & many of the plot lines are predictable. But still, this is very entertaining & just right for a quick , satisfying read. There is a soap opera feel to it all, but I will follow along with further adventures of the  Chronicles.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I truly loved it.  Especially being in the male POV. fantastic the way everything is describes in such detail.  I truly enjoyed. Very numerous I was laughing all threw out the whole story.  Thank u.  Can't wait to see more books.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My wife has been using this DVD workout for over a month and has definitely been shredding from her stomach area. Her legs and arms are toning up and best of all she loves that it's only about a 20 -25 minute workout. It comes with three different workout levels so you can go at your own pace and switch levels whenever you feel you're  ready for the next challenge. Definitely recommend if you're looking to shred those extra inches but I wouldn't recommend for only 30 days. You should include this workout as an everyday routine.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love, love, love this case. It holds up you kindle and NEVER falls down. Very sturdy but still light weight. A must for every Kindle owner. Marware meets and exceeds my expections. I will buy another if and when this one wears out.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The visual quality of the movie was poor. For some reason, Amazon charges more for HD films (which is really crappy, in our opinion), so we don't order them in HD. It's a good movie, but we would have enjoyed it more if the quality had been decent.<br />I don't remember this happening before, so perhaps there was another reason for the low quality. In any case, it's probably the end of yet another movie supplier for us. Seems you can't get good service anywhere, unless you pay extra or go to the theater (which has become vastly overpriced). One more digital gadget out the window....
B008JFUP0I|5.0|We just got back from seeing this movie in the Theater and lemme tell ya, this movie ROCKED!!! A lot of action and a part or two that brought tears to my eyes... I can't wait to BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was thoroughly entertaining. I like the perspective that Drew was telling his story. It had laugh out loud moments, I can't believe you did that moments, panty dropping moments and melt your heart moments. Drew is definitely on my list of favorite book boyfriends.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Seen it before but wanted grandkids to see it, very good choice everyone enjoyed it. glad I got it again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its really good the kids love it but you should make it easer to get on the bord but other than that I love it
B00006DEFA|5.0|This is the greatest movie I have seen, the closest to perfection a film has ever come. It's well-written, well-acted, well-done all the way around, and it includes perhaps the best soundtrack a movie has ever had. I highly recommend finding three hours to watch this movie.
B00B193IS0|5.0|The cover on this CD says it all...we are not 25 any more, but sure as hell are not going to retire gracefully.<br />Billy has kept a passion without letting it burn a hole in his gut.<br />Levi Stubb's tears  have fallen..not forgotten, but we move on<br />A well produced album that warrants a regular spin.......leaves you in a better mood each time.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|I remember Going to the V.I.P. and the dance floor and they are played Donna, She brought such joy and love to her music,while we danced we stepped into another place for a while and forgot everything. thanks Donna and God bless....
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|After I got the game for over 4 dollars the price of the game is now 99&cent;<br />Please can I get a refund from gameloft
B00C061I3K|1.0|Disappointed.  Just extremely disappointed.  Reviewer RCP90 matched my sentiments exactly.  Laurent Schark, Obenhaus, and Razihel all have excellent remixes of Get Lucky that I would much rather listen to.  Daft Punk just seemed to try too hard...
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I was excited to see that this is the Free App of the Day. Unfortunately, I am having the same issue as several other reviewers: the game freezes after I press &quot;play.&quot; No matter how many times I uninstall and try again, it does not work.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|I felt the movie was good for the target audience of young girls. The only problem was a demon at the end that might scare some of the youngest viewers.<br /><br />For fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, there are lots of easter eggs, such as Scootaloo doing the chicken dance and Fluttershy's meeting Spike paralleling her original meeting Spike as a pony. (For non-fans, Scootaloo is a young pegasus type pony who was called a chicken by one of her friends.) Others aren't as obvious and can only be seen by watching the background characters. Watch to the end of the credits to find all the easter eggs.<br /><br />Music for the movie was not of the same sort as in the broadcast series. Dan Ingram, who writes the song for MLP also wrote the songs for the EqG movie. But he wrote the songs in a pop music style that will appeal to children. Don't expect \\"The Art of the Dress\\" or \\"Winter Wrap Up\\". I didn't find the songs very memorable the first time I heard them, but they weren't objectional.<br /><br />The biggest weakness in the plot is the speed that the villain changes after she has lost. That isn't uncommon for the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic television series. Where most sitcoms dwell on otherwise admirable characters behaving badly, MLP tends to have characters change when shown that they are wrong. The reasons that the characters change are not necessarily spelled out, which may be why the program resonates with so many older viewers. Viewers associate their own motives with the characters. Those motives can be complex or simple as the viewer choses.<br /><br />Over all, it was fun and entertaining. The script and soundtracks were both far beyond what is normally found in children's programming, especially programming for little girls. If I could have stayed in the theater for a second showing, I would have done so.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good app! Helps the kids keep track of the remaining battery life and reminds them to recharge. It is easy to see at a glance battery life and performance.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it<br />its great<br />it's fun it feels like your runnimg your own little city<br />I recommend. this great game ti everyone and anyone
B0081X8AE6|4.0|Micheal has a wonderful soothing voice and all of the selections on this cd were extraordinary. Would highly recommend and will follow his career in the future.
B0027DK206|4.0|I was also hesitant in ordering the Instant Back after reading some of the reviews.  But I've run about 6 packs of film (60 exposures) through it and not a single mis-feed.  One thing I wish they would improve on is the small exposure counter window.  The number is difficult to read because it is so tiny.
B000IZ21BS|3.0|After I placed an order for this digital content the movie did not play. I thought it was my wireless connection, and then switched to wired (cables) and the same thing on screen as it kept buffering like crazy. I then went ahead and browsed through other titles to see if I could be at fault but no as I found that other movies (at least previews) played perfectly.<br />I apparently got stuck with a digital content which can't be refunded (as per Amazon guidelines) and I don't have an email for a true technical support to check this out. Needless to say, I spent 3.5 hours giving this buffering thing and nothing, blank, nada!<br />I happen to live in the NYC area and this is quite uncommon thing to happen to me. I do wish for Amazon to refund my money but hey, I asked for it. My loss their gain $$$<br />The movie I am sure it is still spectacular after 25years, so sorry for the movie fanatics if this was not a &#34;review&#34;, but I was cheated tonight having my warm popcorn in hand. Thanks Amazon and Mr Bezos!
1451695195|5.0|I dont want to say anyone else who has had a NDE are crazy, but maybe it means a little more coming from such a highly educated person that didn't believe in the first place.  Great read
B008XBCJ34|5.0|For the price I got here in Amazon, I wish all 3Ds are this affordable. The movie review is of course a 5 start by itself. Item was exactly as described. Picture quality is amazing.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book Rocks. And it has a lesson for All of Us. It's not just about zombies. It's about humans the very bad and the very good. Everyone should read this book.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I have used this calculator or a version of it for 20 plus years in real estate.  My purchase of a new one through Amazon more than exceeded my expectations.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|Connected with the authors immediately and throughout.  Will recommend to any and all! The website is also a great resource.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Difficult to follow and very easy to lose your attention. This is one of the worst movies I've watched in years. I couldn't even finish it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Awesome, awesome book. Even better than Gone Girl!! I typed for Libby the whole way! I hope there's a sequel!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was short but great. Challenging and fun. Well worth the $2. I look forward to the next one!
B0006B2A42|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies that we had on VHS. We are in the process of upgrading these movies to our DVD collection. It was nice to see this one again after so many years, only with improved DVD quality. The plot set during the cold war years shows good writing and acting is great, which is no surprise given the actors in this film. We recommend this movie.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app with lots of choices.  I use the night sounds to fall asleep and the &quot;flute&quot; for my tai chai practice.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies that we had on VHS. We are in the process of upgrading these movies to our DVD collection. It was nice to see this one again, only with improved DVD quality. This is just one of those great movies that is fun to watch and makes us feel good. Great writing and acting. As per the movie, if we knew this was coming we would have baked a cake. We rated this movie a 10 with 10 being the best score.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a little slow going in the beginning while she 're explained things from the first book. But it got up to speed by the 3rd chapter. I love the detail she gives of the world and the people in it. All the little back stories of the different characters is fun to read about.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of 16. It can get a bit graphic. Some younger readers might not understand or be frightened by what they read.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Of course, Hey Ho was the first song of the Lumineers I had heard. I kind of loved them. I decided to buy the whole album and was pleasantly pleased. I like their style. If you like Hey Ho, you'll like the album.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|This mouse does have excellent tracking and response. However, it is bigger than I thought. I have small fingers and the side buttons interfere with my grip. I love the sturdy braided cable. Looks like a good product but size options would be ideal.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the best one I have ever read in my life I can not wait till the next next movie
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game starts slow but it pulls you in. You find yourself setting there waiting sometimes for more coins. It's a fun<br /> game. It is also fun for the kids as well. Great game.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|If you love talking bears, and raw humor, you will love this movie. When I need a good laugh, ted does it for me.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|This is a nice CD but not my favorite.  However, I am a fan and will buy whatever he puts out.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Thoroughly pleased :) I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in thrillers or mystery. It has its graphic moments but you still can't seem to put the book down.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Now this is Mitch Albom at his best.  I fell in love with this book and have been both friends and family to read it.  What a lovely tribute to Rabbi Lewis.  I wish I had known him.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This was the funniest book that I have read in a long time.  I laughed so hard at times that I cried!  It was very entertaining.  This is one of Sophie Kinsella's best books.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I love Mitch Albom and there were some good lessons in this book, but I lost interest early on and don't think it is his best.  I would recommend Mitch Albom fans should read it and formulate their own opinions though.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Want a high body count, graphic violence, muscle cars and guns, guns, guns?  You've rented the right movie.  Schwartzenegger's old but still good in a predictable but fun actioner.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was very good. The movie is very different from this. Certain parts did not tie well, but overall it was a good read.
B004FECNIO|5.0|A.I. Artificial Intelligence [Blu-ray] The Best Robot Movie ever and the most beilevable Robot Movie Ever.  Faboulous Special Effects Colors. Too bad  it was not available in 3D
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Stephen King wrote in a very casual, conversational manner. It was almost as if you were sitting in his study and he was giving you his insights into writing, sprinkled with his personal life story. It was fascinating to get inside the mind of a master writer. It was one of those books I did not want to end. Highly recommend it for anyone interested in writing.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy) It was Scary Great. Great Special Effects. The Story was good too.  The 3D was excelent.
B0041CGP02|1.0|Well I was Excited When I Opened up The CD, With 2 Disks, and after Playing The First CD it Skipped the Whole Time, Right Threw Every... SONG ...Maybe They Had Problems during Production, So BAck it Went to Amazon!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I think this should be shown in every history class.  In fact, I think it should be manditory for EVERY member of Congress at least once a year!  Maybe it will help them work together and get something done!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|fun, wish it was longer hope they have/make more like this. 9 more words. now 6 more words now 2
1455875732|4.0|Although a bit repetitive at times, the [audio]book is a good coverage of Google: both in its history and its ups and downs. It gives a good understanding of how Google thinks and behaves. Gotta love Google.

B000001FTJ|5.0|This album is a wonderfully eclectic journey of sound and lyrics. Tom Waits shows great artistic range on this album swaying from tenderness to coarseness and back through a wonderful blend of sound textures. Highly recommended listening!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book. It made me laugh so much. It had a great romance. You will enjoy this book. So worth the price.
B000003CMC|4.0|In my opinion this is the last truly great album released by The Allman Brothers Band. Having this album on CD is great, but I sure miss the original vinyl cover art and gate fold.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|While I wish there could be more of a plot-line this game has proven its beauty from every aspect. Movement is smooth and graphics are outstanding. 5/5 recommend.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This adapter works great and, with the help of a firewire 800/400 conversion cable I was able to connect a DVD burner to a new iMac with thunderbolt.  The combination operates smoothly.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This shrpener is compact,but works very well, the stick for sharpening serrated portion of blades works great. Easy to carry with you, and easy to use. Item shipped and arrived on time as promised.Would recommend to anyone looking for sharpener for smaller knifes. Will not work on thicker blades like found on many bowie knives and swords
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is GREAT! You'll love it! This land building adventure may take some patience, but it's so worth it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Exactly what you expect - lots of fun,  challenging puzzles and a whole lot of addiction! I just can't put it down!
B00005YUPO|5.0|Exactly as advertised. Great music. Entertaining video. Kids love it and watch it over and over. We have Bach, Beethoven and Motzart and we wish the series had many other composers.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Sharp Objects was really good and then there is this book. The suspense was minimal and I hated both of the characters throughout the entire book. And it ended terribly!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome! I like it so much. If you like horses and unicorns,this is the game for you!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great ap for Spider Solitaire, can now play anywhere on my Kindle. It is an entertaining, challenging game to kill some time.
B00005UWUE|4.0|I love this version and wanted to update my VHS to a DVD. When I received this, I was surprised to see that it was made for use in the United Kingdom and would not play on my DVD player. Make sure you order the correct one!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|This was a decent book. I thought there would be more info on how to help young people acquire character in their lives directed toward teachers, parents, physicians, and other persons who can strategize to help improve character skills in our youth so in that respect I don't feel that the book was effective.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It captivated me from the moment I opened it. A long download, and some coins, but it was worth it for me. The effects in the background really added to the tone, seeing as I started it at midnight...
0930289234|5.0|I heard the hype for it, and that was about it. I didn't know much about the storyline, or what even happens. I'm glad I didn't. Reading it like a new book was what made it great. Has become so beloved by me, I'm thinking of reading the Before Watchmen series :D

B0073HNNE8|4.0|I decided to read Room because it was on my little brother's required reading list in school. In order to help him out I figured I'd read it. Boy was I taken with it. I could hardly put it down. For me, it's the first time I've read an adult book told from the perspective of a 5-year old. By knowingly using grammatical errors, it gave the book more of a &#34;reality&#34; feel to it. The story itself is sad as a whole, seeing that a mother had to &#34;hide&#34; the existence of a whole world outside of the confines of their 'Room' in order to ensure that the boy will not grow up wanting more than that which is available in the Room. The trauma that they go through once they escape is not far-fetched from that which one can expect from people who had to go through this ordeal. Knowing that this story was inspired by actual events makes it more astonishing that Donoghue could manage to lay the focus on an &#34;unknowing&#34; victim instead of focusing on the usual &#34;bad&#34; and &#34;bad guys&#34; that come with these events.<br /><br />At the end I am left with a somewhat feeling of &#34;unfinished business&#34; since we do not get to jump to the future and find out how this little boy and his mother turned out after many years. We also don't know what happened to the bastard who kidnapped the mother other than him being arrested. I would've liked some closure on these things. I'm left wondering if in fact they were able to cope and have a better life, or if the trauma was so extensive that they were not able to live a &#34;normal&#34; life after Room. This is mainly the reason why I'm not giving it a 5-star. But again, that's me as a reader wanting to know more than what the writer decided was the complete story.<br /><br />All in all, a fine piece of literature. I would recommend this book for sure.
0307591549|3.0|Mr. Achor repeatedly trumpets his Harvard ties so I wanted to learn more about his background.  What I found was both disappointing and quite surprising.  Mr. Achor refers repeatedly but obliquely to his decade of \\"research at harvard\\" and implies that he has scientifically proved that happiness leads to success, while leaning heavily on the harvard name to lend credibility to his claims.  Yet for all the pages spent on chummy stories about harvard, he never actually gets around to telling us, specifically, what research he did, how he did it, or what the data revealed.  A casual reader might not even notice that sleight of hand.  He just refers to it in generalities.  Ok.  Let's search Google Scholar to see what Mr. Achor has published on the link between happiness and success.  Surprise!  There are zero publications.  Mr. Achor has never published a single solitary scientific paper in his life!  At this point I'm feeling just plain lied to.    How could this guy be a Harvard professor?  Well, a quick search of the internet tells us that Shawn is not and never was a harvard professor, and has no current affiliation to harvard at all.  In fact, he seems to use every trick he can to get us to think he's a famous and popular professor without ever quite claiming that he is (I'm guessing Harvard's lawyers would have a field day with him otherwise, or maybe they already have).  He's treading a very careful and deceptive line to inflate his qualifications far beyond the reality.  He *was* once a student at Harvard (it looks like he got a master's degree in divinity -- not a science, the last time I checked).  Even the lowliest faculty job at a mediocre university (much less Harvard) would require a PhD, which Shawn does not have.  Shawn refers obliquely in his book to his decade of \\"research at harvard\\" but, as I noted above, if you search Google Scholar, you will see he has never published any credible scientific research at all.  Zero.  Nothing.  It is unclear whetherhe has ever had any scientific training of any kind, or if his \\"research\\" involved anything other than sitting around in his dorm room.  He says he is a \\"harvard-trained researcher\\" but a master's in divinity isn't scientific training and, again, there is no record of his participation in any actual research and no mention of the actual scientists he worked with.  He certainly hasn't done any credible scientific research proving that \\"happiness leads to success.\\"  What he does appear to have done, and I say this as a petty, jealous graduate student scraping by on a tiny stipend, is make a lot of money.  Selling himself as a harvard scientist (which he is not), he appears to charge huge speaking fees (as in, more for one speech than I make in a year) to hear about his \\"research.\\"  That sounds to me like someone chasing success, not happiness.  I am hugely sympathetic to the ideas this book contains, but given how much the author is distorting his own qualifications for personal gain I worry that he is distorting the science as well.    UPDATE in response to comments:    @DSC46    I agree completely.  If he had just let the content speak for itself, I would have no complaints.  Plenty of people without special qualifications write decent books.  The book is easy to read, easy to understand, and has useful points even if I don't find much of it to be truly new.  Based on the average review here on Amazon, people seem to feel like they are getting value out of it.  That's great.    With the way he harps on harvard over and over, and implies that he is a famous and popular professor at harvard who has done legitimate scientific research, however, it just feels slimy to me and like he is trying to fool his readers. It sounds like you have confirmation from connections at harvard that he is inflating his qualifications.  Very interesting.    @Winter Park    I can assure you that I have read the book quite carefully.  If I ignore the author's self-inflation, it's largely adecent book.  If you're asking me to evaluate the content of the book, I will admit that I do find much of Happiness Advantage to be fairly derivative once I scratch below the surface.  That's actually why I bothered to look into Mr. Achor's qualifications in the first place.  I was expecting a harvard professor to be talking about his cool original research that I wouldn't have heard about elsewhere, but then I read through the whole book and realized that even though he kept referring to his research he never actually presented ANY data from his own original research.  That seemed fishy to me, and so I bothered to look into who this guy was, and my review is the result.    The overall narrative is novel -- happiness is the key to success (but success doesn't make you happy).  I don't know enough to determine if he's correct, but it's an interesting idea.  But once you get to the supporting details, it's largely (though certainly not entirely) a rehash of other people's ideas.  No other book talks about the \\"Zorro Circle,\\" but plenty of books talk about starting daunting tasks with small doable steps (the same thing but without the fancy name).  Plenty of books talk about the power of habits in determining our behavior or the value of social relationships for happiness.  Mr. Achor even talks in the book about reading other books to get content for his book. But whether the ideas are derivative doesn't matter if the ideas are new to you. The content of lots of books are derivative and people still read them and get value from them.  Heck, there is value is hearing the same idea a bunch of times because maybe, eventually, it will really sink in.  In any event, the author does a good job communicating these ideas, and his overarching narrative is more original.  If it weren't for the dishonesty, I'd probably give the content of the book 3 stars.  It's not terribly original, but it's well-written, practical, and a quick, easy read.    I just think he's being dishonestabout his qualifications and the basis for his ideas in order to sell more books and charge higher speaking fees.  It rubs me the wrong way and I think his readers are getting tricked, as are the companies that are paying big money to hear him speak about his \\"research.\\" What's sad is that it's unnecessary and I think the deception will catch up with him eventually.  For better or worse, there are plenty of authors who write bestsellers without any real qualifications, and they don't feel the need to lie about it.    If you can find any actual evidence that Mr. Achor (a) has a PhD (b) has ever been the actual instructor for a class at Harvard -- i.e., the one actually teaching the class, not just a teaching assistant (c) conducted ANY peer-reviewed scientific research that is cited in Happiness Advantage or (d) was ever a Professor at Harvard, I will stand corrected.  Mr. Achor may have done a good job in making you think that some or all of these things are true, but if you dig a little deeper I think you will find that they are all false.    @MM of FS    I appreciate your weighing in. I think your comments will help us all be clearer about Shawn's credentials are and are not. As I stated in my original review, Shawn was a harvard student -- an undergraduate student and then a master's student in divinity. And, as is clear in reading his book and on the internet but I should have made clearer in my review - he was a teaching fellow for a psychology class at harvard. That's all fine so far, and true as far as I know; I have no reason to doubt it. Shawn was clearly at Harvard - he isn't making EVERYTHING up. Check.    However, those things aren't what I find dishonest about how Shawn represents his credentials and I think he has managed to pull the wool over your eyes as well. Reading Shawn's book it sounds like he is a harvard professor who conducted legitimate scientific research about happiness and performance.    Specifically:    Shawn was NOT the instructor/professor for the positive psychology course (it was Tal Ben-Shahar -- see his interview on the Daily Show about it, for example).    I see no record that Shawn has ever been the instructor for any class at harvard. He was a teaching fellow (what harvard calls their teaching assistants), but that's not remotely the same thing. Professors at a place like Harvard/Yale/Stanford/etc are world-class leaders in their fields, whereas teaching assistants are usually graduate students in the subject (sometimes someone who graduated college just a year earlier).    Shawn was NEVER a professor at harvard    Shawn did NOT receive a PhD from harvard or anywhere else -- the minimum requirement for being an actual professor and, usually (but not always), for conducting original scientific research.     I can find no record of any actual scientific training Shawn received. I don't know what his undergraduate degree was in, but a master's degree in divinity is not scientific training.    Shawn did NOT conduct ANY peer-reviewed research whatsoever contained in the book The Happiness Advantage. He talks over and over and over again all about his \\"research\\" but I can find no record of any peer-reviewed research he conducted anywhere in the book. If you can find citations for peer-reviewed research Shawn led that is contained in the book The Happiness Advantage, please tell us all the page numbers where we can dig into the details of his alleged scientific research. As far as I can tell, there are ZERO. Heck, I'd be happy to see some graphs of actual data he collected, even if they aren't peer reviewed.     So, in short, I'm not saying Shawn is completely lying about his connection to Harvard. But I think he is taking tiny morsels of truth (undergrad student and divinity master's student at harvard, teaching assistant) and grossly exaggerating them to mislead his readers to think he is/was a professor at harvard, that he is a legitimate and trained scientist, and that he performed legitimate scientific research to produce the book The Happiness Advantage. He seems to do everything he can to conceal these facts from the reader and to inflate his own importance and qualifications.  It's dishonest and I think readers deserve to know the facts.

B00BVXO37G|4.0|Movie was more focused on the evidence gathering of the armed forces than the actual raid itself. Approx. 85% of the movie was about how they obtained the info to find Bin Laden, then around 15% was the actual raid to take him out. If buying the movie because you expect the movie to be purely about the raid itself, rent it first!! But, I will say this, the movie itself is actually pretty good.

B000LN7HUC|4.0|I bought this stove for solo overnight hikes and have been really impressed by how easy and effective it is. As a kit it is light weight and everything packs into the pot and is held in place by the pan which serves as a lid. There is not much space left over for other items but I have been storing a box of waterproof matches in there as well. You can buy a cover for the kit separately but it would be nice if one was included with the kit since you are probably not going to want to drop into your pack just the way it comes out of the box (although you could).<br /><br />Functionality wise it couldn't be much easier to use the stove. I use Heet for fuel (cheap and easy to get) and boiling a full pot of water for food or coffee takes less than 2 oz of fuel (call it 1 1/2 oz roughly). I have never tracked the time but its roughly five minutes for a full pot of water.<br /><br />The included stand does a great job of holding the pot or pan as well as shielding the burner from light breezes (not gale winds). Although the pot holder looks pretty weak it does a fine job of holding a full pot of water (boiling hot) making it possible to pour the hot water into a cup or food pouch.<br /><br />I would give this kit 5 stars right now if it came with a cover. This is a really well designed, rugged, light weight, and easy to use kit. I couldn't find anything else that was this complete for the solo hiker that came anywhere near the price.

B000V1Z8KK|3.0|I usually don't go for this type of movie, but Wahlberg is an actor I enjoy so how bad could it be?  Well, it could have been great, but I had to listen to Glover talk on and on and on in a hoarse lisping whisper of a voice.  Who's idea was this?  There are dozens of other actors that could have and should have played that part.  Had it not been a really great movie I could not have borne Danny Glover, I would have turned it off completely.

As for Jimmy Page, what can you say, an old gray fox still at the top of his game looking like he was having that time of his life.  John Paul Jones still rock solid and Jason Bonham did an admirable job filling in for his foolish father.
0425263908|4.0|People have been saying this book is a rip off of 50 Shades. In my opinion this makes 50 Shades look like an appetizer and Bared to You is the main course. Of course there are some similarities,(Eva's eyes are gray like Christian's, Gideon's eyes are blue like Ana's, Gideon is young and rich, Eva's mother has been married four times). The differences are Eva is not a virgin, has her own money, and her dad is still alive. Both her and Gideon were abused (I won't elaborate how), Eva's best friend is a bisexual guy who also has a few issues. The intercourse described in Bared to You is more intense and will have you blushing just reading it. Another thing I appreciate about the Bared to You series is there is no intercourse during Eva's menstruation (was grossed out when I read that part in Fifty Shades). What I don't like about the book is how Gideon started to push Eva away and there was no explanation as why until towards the end but I'm hopeful that Entwined with You takes Eva and Gideon's relationship to new heights.

B00BPA6XUK|4.0|I would like this score so much more if it had come out before Tron Legacy. It is good listen, just not as unique. In fact, there were times when I thought I was listening to Tron Legacy. If I put them both in a playlist and hit random, I think I would have a hard time telling them apart if I was't so familiar already with Tron Legacy.<br /><br />There are also some hints of the Nolan Batman score and some Elliot Goldenthal, both of which appeal to me.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|What an Awesome game! I'm half paralyze, I can barely move my fingers and I can still play the game. To the people who says that this game sucks and the control is difficult well there's probably something wrong with them. Anyway for me this game is totally awesome.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was our book club choice for May. It is a must for any book list of any kind.<br />Don't miss reading this book
B00004YA66|4.0|A very enjoyable plot line and some really solid acting from Mr. Quaid and Mr. Caviezel. Especially nice for the portrayal of 'father-son' realtionship.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I am probably one of the very few people who had never had the opportunity to watch this delightful musical live during its many tours. My interest was reawakened when a friend began discussing the musical and I had to admit I had not seen it. I found a filmed version of the live London performance on YouTube and fell in love and had to have a &#34;real&#34; copy of it for my own. While there is some difference in costuming and sets used in the recorded &#34;live&#34; performance and the film version, the film version is just as absorbing and masterfully executed as the live performance.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love the game.fun to play, easy to learn. Did crash a few times in my kindle for HD. But other than that I love it. I love dragons, I collect figurine dragons, so this is fun.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If you are looking for a quick read, this is it.  I started reading the book one morning and just couldn't put it down.  I ended up reading the book in one day.  It's a terrific read!  I really enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I thought this was absolutely great!!! The description of Silo 18 was fantastic. I felt I was right there with the people as the story progressed. Hope the follow-up books are as good as this one.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|This is a very excellent statement of the dark side that lies within all of us. It is very much a Civil War version of Schindler's List. It just could have been very much less graphic - the point would have been made. The \\"blood-bursts\\" from the shot bodies were so obviously burst balloons!
B0084ANCBC|1.0|A depressing story of a world saturated in irrepressible vanity.  It was a sickening read, full if adultery and pointless endeavors of social climbing.  After spending weeks on end trying to stumble through this massive book, you come away with a dissatisfied, despondent  air.  I highly discourage anyone from wasting their time on this fruitless novel.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|A cute, light read....entertaining....predictable and short.  A few scenes seemed pointless.  Recipe at end for main bake good.  Enjoyable quick read nonetheless.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book has it all!! Humor, Romace, Sex and a host of characters that brings this book to life... All brought together from a male's point of view. This book keep me captivated from start to finish. BRAVO Emma Chase!!!!<br /><br />I anxiously await other books in this series. Dee Dee is one of the characters that I would love to read about.<br /><br />I TOTALLY recommend this book, you won't be disappointed! I just wish I could give it more then 5 Stars!<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it, so I won't write much more, only to say Drew and Katie have it going on..... And I love that Katie can \\"kick ass\\" in a corporate world dominated by men!
0767836324|3.0|It's a great movie. But at some point before I recived it in the mail. The dvd was just loose in the case and it got all scratched up.
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is one of my favorite books - and I'm an English teacher.  so for me to really like a book means a lot.  I highly recommend it.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I can't tell you if it's a good game or not, because it won't let me play. App begins on menu screen, i click &quot;play&quot;, then shows a loading screen, and then right back to the menu. The game never actually proceeds past loading and menu screens.<br />I have uninstalled and reinstalled, but it does not fix the problem.<br />If I am able to play the game I will be able to edit my review to a more informed one.<br />Thanks.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great price. Wonderful first season. You'll be hooked by the first episode! I plan on buying the other seasons soon.
B00064WSNW|5.0|After the original lineup with Greg Lake, this is my favorite Crimson from the 80's. Belew makes this a simply wonderful album, ahead of it's time, as are all Crimson albums.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book isn't really cheerful or happy, but it is beautifully somber and I think we need more books like this. As humans, we love happy ending and we don't really deal with pain or sadness unless we have too. This book addresses this along with an engaging story line. I have to be in a certain mood to read it, but I'm sure I'll read it again and again.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Kind of mindless, which is why I like it! Playing against friends brings out my competitive side.  Love to keep coming back to it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love using this app on my kindle. It's my favorite way to pin things now! Easy to use and usually pretty fast with very little lag. It's a wonderful app to have on your kindle!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Omg. This book has so many twists and turns, I just could not put it down until I finished it!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Martin writes a lot like J.R.R. Tolkien; VERY detail oriented and many characters but an awesome story line. It's proving to be a bit of a slow read, but I am enjoying every moment, twist and turn.
1579128149|5.0|My students love this book.  They hide it in order to have exclusive access.  I can't blame them, but we have set some rules for fairness.  It would make a delightful and cherished gift.
B00127RAJY|5.0|After day one, I was dying, but seeing the difference, that's for sure! The video is easy to follow and all you needs is hand weights and a little bit of room. I love that I only have to spend 20 mins on an awesome work out. I plan on buying more of Jillian Michael's DVDs when I get through this one!
B00CRMX53S|5.0|So I really can't get enough of \\"Get Lucky\\" by Daft Punk but the remainder of the album is not that great in my opinion.  And this is coming from someone who likes DP and 70's disco/funk.  The combination of the two just doesn't seem to work for some reason.  But I have to admit that \\"Get Lucky\\" is one of the best songs of the year so far.  So very catchy and I just can't help from movin' to the music with this one.  Take a listen to the preview and check it out...very nice song.  It's been stuck in my head since it came out and it still is.  I catch myself humming the tune at work almost daily.  Listen to preview then get it.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I'd never get this app again. The pac man doesn't move as fluidly as he should and I end up loosing because of the lag. Not cool.
B00003CY6M|5.0|This is a movie that Im glad to have in my collection. Cusak & Beckinsale are the cutest couple EVER! There are tears, laughs & makes the heart light.  One of the best flicks Ive seen in a long time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you can make something great even better, you have something special.  They definitely accomplished this with Temple Run 2.
B003L77GG0|5.0|The evolution of Tom Welling from a young Clark to a grown man is highly entertaining and this is just one of those shows that brings in good fun family entertainment. Its good clean fun!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed this book for the story aspect. The author, who is a neurosurgeon, tends to &#34;complicate&#34; the story part by injecting too much science/theory into the whole experience. I've read 'better' stories about people who have gone to heaven and have come back.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was impossible to second-guess the twists in this book!  I loved the writing, which is as important to me as a good plot. :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King does it again.  Before reading I was worried it might be dry, without the \\"horror\\" I so enjoy from King, but King is never dry.  And horror certainly does exist in reality, no inhuman monsters needed.  Not so much about history as about characters, and about how one thing leads to the next.  Well-written.  Immersing page-turner the whole way through.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Based on a true story, this movie grabs the viewer's attention immediately and holds it to the extraordinary end. The adventures between the French aristocrat and an ex-con from the projects are often hilarious, and always touching. It has truly become one of my favorite movies. I understand why it was a Golden Globe nominee - best foreign language film 2013.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Ben Affleck makes this movie.  Two scenes - his eye movements alone - say everything.  Never had a to say a word.  Feel good movie.<br />Can not stand reviews which describe, play by play, the entire movie.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this app it brings such a relaxing game for my kids to play and me that does come with a new found love for music
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Gave as present during the holidays.  7 year old Nephew did not put this down.  First time one of them did not have an electronic gadget glued to their face.  He asked someone to carefully hold it while he rolled the dice during another game.  Multi-tasking game player.  Great present.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|It never came thru on my Kindle!  I ordered this a long time ago.  Don't know what the problem is!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The sentences are short and have few details, but the story was great. You should at least try this classic, for it won't be long enough for you to regret reading it.
B00CWIMY3O|4.0|Episode 4 was truncated because of it's storyline being too close to reality (at the time) for the network. And it made it a dog's breakfast of an episode.<br /><br />So I will reserve judgement until we know whether it's included, uncut, or not.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|By far one of the best books I've read. It's easy to relate to. I will be reading it many more times.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is just simply amazing<br /> You can duplicate get stuff that not even in the game yet. You can have infinite health bar. And put stuff on other peoples servers.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Wow, I got this game as the FAotD and I am VERY impressed. The game doesn't look good at startup, but trust me, you'll like it. The goal of the game is to match tiles to kill monsters and open chests. After a while you'll level up and get new rooms and, eventually, get out of your dungeon. I definitely like this game.<br />Very good soundtrack, it gets you hyped while playing.<br />Gameplay is quite fun, can keep you entertained for hours.
B000088E6D|5.0|I love his voice, he has a very soulful, cheerful way of singing and making it sound romantic. He can sing anything and make it sound good.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|.They just patched the game and it wiped my city ,I have to start at the beginning.<br />I've spent 2 months building my city , this sucks,  I would have given it 5 stars but really . Should have known better than to trust game companies today.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a great alarm. Took me a minute to figure out how to set it, but I enjoy waking up without thinking that the house is on fire. Easy on the ears.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've used this product for over a year and love it!  I can set several alarms each with a different sound and sleep timer.  Works like a charm and it was free!  :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thanks for this book.  So much imagination and work went into it.  This is one of those reads that really makes you think.  I will reveal my age when I say it reminded me a bit of \\"Soylent Green\\"'  it is nice to read a book that actually makes your mind work a bit.  Waiting  for more...
B00CW665VI|5.0|Definitely one of the best books I've read this year. You'll fall head over hills in love with Drew and Kate. The writing was amazing. I loved reading from Drew's POV and the story was told in the most real way. After I finished, I actually felt like I had gained insight into the male psyche.  It was hilarious. The best guy's POV I've ever read, and I love a guys POV in books, so that's saying something. My recommendation to you would be BUY THIS BOOK!!! It's an incredible story!!<br /><br />Emma Chase has most definitely earned herself a fan for life.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|a fun way to waste time... the colors are very bright and entertaining.... my son loves nemo and this game...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had heard some of what this book was about, enough to make me want to read  I couldn't put it down once I started reading.  I was disappointed as to how it ended....but it made me curios enough to buy the 2nd book.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I liked the movie my son loves toy story. Great quality, Great picture, awesome movie. my son can watch this movie over and over.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show is great and all of the seasons are worth the money.  I Can't wait for the live finale.
0735619670|5.0|recommended to every programmer.. i have read chunks of it and have started to use the advice given in the book. It is great.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game.  It has great graphics and is great fun. First time I played was up to 2:00 am
B0058SNIC6|3.0|I am normally a size 9.5 and I have wider feet than many women, but I read the reviews and ordered a 9.  The strap in the back ,ake them just a little too big, so I have to return them.  Otherwise, they're adorable!  I bought the Crocs Women's Kadee Ballet Flat in a 9 and they fit perfect and are probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn.  So, if you like the Jayda, try it, Amazon has free returns!
1612680011|4.0|The book does a wonderful job at questioning your money/financial philosophy. I've been brought up as his 'poor Dad' was; get a good education and then get a good job with benefits. In 2013 this strategy no longer works as well as it did 30 years ago, and this book paints a good picture of another way to look at finances and employment. Kiyosaki tries to teach you to view yourself and your job as a business and trying to keep your business profitable and afloat. I only give it 4 stars because more specific examples on how to create 'passive income' would have been appreciated.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|has been a good item!! Glad I got it. It is slim and does not add a lot of bulk but still protects my Kindle very well. Another strap on the other side would be helpful but not a necessity.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is new so I am not going to be able to give an exact review but for now its great.  Popular so know this will be a hit.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I bought this for my mother in law as well.  She is mesmerized by the whole show.  One of the best gifts I ever got her.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Now come on this is so popular how can you go wrong right!!!  So I'll add a few more words to get this passed, it's GREAT!!!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is the best book in the whole series. Make sure to read all the books in the series. Great series!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is new so I am not going to be able to give an exact review but for now its great.  Gotta be great for the kids right?
B008JAG2AA|5.0|I recently just watched the first three.  Yeah I know I am a little late!  This movie is so funny and not too raunchy.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Great music that brings back wonderful memories of younger years...and dancing feet!  Put a smile on my face. Highly recommend for all the Baby Boomers that loved the Bee Gees!
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This movie is perfect for adults and kids.  Really funny and a good story line.  You gotta see it!  You will laugh your head off!
B009LK6JS2|2.0|I would easily give this game a better ranking, however i have emailed the devs for tech support twice and have never herd back. Shame on you rortos for not supporting your product. Their motto shoud be sell it and forget it. Sad because this is one of the better android games out there but if you have issues or questions you are on your own. If i ever get a response i will update my review.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome and I cant wait till the updates and ive built a sandcastle and the survurvivalcraft already had the updates,
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game really seems to change up the places and ways to find things.  I am really enjoying my time on this site.
0817439390|4.0|Having heard about this book and it was highly recommeneded by other customers, I took a stab and bought this along with other books hoping to expand my knowledge. I read this book as soon as I received this and I have to say that for beginners the author really dumbed it down to simple math....in some chapters literally. I was just looking to see if there were things that I didn't know and there were a good few things that I learned. Having only gotten into photography a year ago I didn't know everything but I picked up so much in a short amount of time. Even better that some of the others in my area. But as I said before there were things I didnt know and this book has helped me expand that knowledge. If you are a novice or amateur then this book is great for you. That being said....the book is a little spaced. I mean all the chapters do show and tell you how he got he shots but It takes a lot to get to the point of the lesson. Overall though its a good book totally recommended to anyone.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My husband loves Adele & this is the first CD I got for my husband!  He listens to it all the time, sometimes driving me a little insane!  Now I know what I put my parents through!
B009MYARIK|1.0|Usually Sophie Kinsella books are light and funny.  This one reads like a terrible romantic comedy.  I didn't laugh once only cringed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thus game is a very fun game because u. Can jump over stuff aan update  for better stuff<br />And it is a successful game because a bynch of people at school have it
B00C061I3K|5.0|The first time I've bought a physical album in nearly 10 years. The instant I saw the SNL Get lucky teaser, I preordered the album.<br /><br />I haven't stopped playing it since I got it. There is SO much more to the album than just 'Get lucky'<br /><br />Lose yourself to dance, Beyond, Giorgio by Moroder are all fantastic tracks; followed closely by Contact, Instant Crush, and Give Life Back to Music.<br /><br />If you love Electronica, and disco, this album is the bees knees.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|For some reason somebody decided people wouldn't want things flying out of their 3D HDTVs,  They are wrong.  The home version can be the same as the theatrical version,  It's been done with Journey to the Center Of the Earth with outstanding and fun things coming at you.  While you get some things on the viewers side sticking out the majority is based on depth which isn't bad but it could have been Great!
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I have no idea why, but this game is just not working. the game loads the menu page then I have to hit the back button before it will let me select anything, then when I hit play it acts like it's loading but it just sends me back to the menu page. Samsung galaxy s 3. .. this free app of the day is definitely getting deleted, glad I didn't spend any money on this.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|It has saved my phone on multiple occasions. The only thing I dislike about it is the fact that it will cut off my phone when I take it off to fully clean the screen. The piece by the headphone also broke about a week in, so be careful with that if you choose to get one.
B00BLH2JNC|4.0|This was a real good movie,the story was true and well done. There was a lot of action, and It kept me on the edge of my seat,wondering how the company would fair.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I love this movie. I saw it in theaters and i couldn't wait to buy it. Also a side note in the movie Anabel wears these wedge shoes that i loved so much i bought some just like them. It's a scary movies but not a blood an guts scary movie so my mom in her old age is able to enjoy it as well.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci weaves numerous details into the narrative giving it a more realistic feel. Really draws the reader into the mindset of the main character and making the reader more a part of the action.
B000EGDB10|5.0|Bought it s a gift for my brother, who loved it. The Collector's Edition has a lot of special features perfect for any fan of the Mission Impossible series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is really sweet butt I think that driving is the most important thing. Because win you drive it's just really hard. But when I got the game I thought the man driving the vehicle was drunk. So I am looking for a hit for THIS GAME
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Another excellent Special Edition DVD with a ton of extra content perfect for any Batman fan. My brother loved it (it was a gift for him).
075669812X|4.0|I purchased this specifically because it has the green ninja.  All my son asked for for his birthday was the green ninja, but the only Lego set I could find with the green ninja was $80+!  Way too much when all he wanted was the figuring.  This solved my problem.  As for the book, well, it's pretty much what you'd expect: a synopsis of all the characters, their stories, etc.  Pretty much a Ninjago dictionary.
145210655X|5.0|If you want to know what Darth Vader would have been like had he been a good a guy, this is the book to read (to your kids!)
B005QBBCMI|5.0|Love conquers all...or nearly all.  In the midst of the dark underbelly of Los Vegas, two broken people find love.  The outside world sees them as trash, but through all the pain, they find love for each other.  The final scene in the motel room is something I never expected to see in a film.  Cage is a hell of an actor, but so is Elizabeth Shue.  five stars is really not enough.  Not for you if you have weak stomach or are already depressed.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Great story, great video, everyone should see this video to truly understand why The Eagles are the band that they are...
B00AA0U05A|3.0|First let me say that Ms Rossum is an absolutely fantastic singer. She can sing for delicacy, beauty, power, you name it.<br /><br />She is let down by some of the arrangements on this album. A few are quite good and show off her amazing skills. &#34;These Foolish Things&#34;, &#34;Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out&#34; are nice. &#34;Autumn Leaves&#34;  is very moving, unfortunately it sounds like it was recorded in an empty tile swimming pool.<br /><br />Most of the other songs have arrangements that I can only describe as hokey / cutesy. How about an album of jazz standards with real jazz musicians / arrangements, modern sound quality and a chance to show off her terrific singing skill. She deserves no less.
6305128952|5.0|Beautiful story!  Got this for my granddaughter who wants to grow up and model Monte - the real horse whisperer.  Every child who loves horses - and adults also(!) should see this!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I love the Tron soundtrack!  I feel like I'm part of the movie when I listen to this.  As someone who grew up with the original Tron this just takes it all to the next level.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Think it is easy and fun to use. Allows us knowing when it is time to plug in. It is a good product.Two dollars is a great price. The colors help with keeping track too.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Not as good as the trilogy, but enjoyable and thought-provoking.  I'm going to tackle his short stories next, and wait for the half written fourth version of The Sportswriter.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a very fun game. Makes you feel like you are actually in the suit. The reason I gave it four stars is because, i don't like that their is no way to regain health once your hit, and that it seems if you get hit twice, your done. I guess that adds challenge but to me that makes the game unplayable. I constantly get wiped out by missiles because your moving so fast you don't have time to avoid them at times. I guess I'm saying the only thing I don't like about them game is its level of difficulty. I feel it is rather unforgiving. But besides that I highly recommend this game. Especially to iron man fans, or fans of challenging games. And fans of both as well.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was such a great conversation starter with several of my friends and colleagues. It includes important and personal advice and strategies for all people - not just women - hoping to have an impact in their work.
B002VWNID6|1.0|I nor no one I know has ever had a dvd that had to be flipped in order to watch the whole movie. Love the movie but the DVD itself is horrid. I am ashamed to admit that i actually returned one copy becuase it never occured to me that you had to flip it over.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma Chase made me laugh so hard I nearly passed out from lack of oxygen!  I was captivated from the first page to the last.  I even fell asleep reading because I could not put this book down!<br /><br />The book is written solely in Drew's POV and it was refreshing to read a book that was all from the male perspective.  Drew is witty and funny.  He is a driven business man and a self-proclaimed womanizer.  But that all ends with a chance encounter at a bar when he meets Kate.  But.... she's taken and turns him away.  He was in for the shock of his life when he comes face to face with her again, but this time she's on his turf... and a turf war ensues that will have you laughing hysterically at their antics!<br /><br />The chemistry between Drew and Kate was simply palpable.  From the minute they met I knew that this was going to be explosive and it certainly was in more ways then one.  When Drew and Kate finally get together their are fireworks and man does he know his way around a woman's body... Drew made me blush a few times!  WOW!  But he is also sensitive and sincere and his love for his little niece completely melted my heart!  Every man should read this book and take some lessons from Drew Evans in the swoon department!  He's a charmer when he wants and needs to be.<br /><br />What I loved the most was the absolute honesty in this book.  It's funny, but every single word is believable.  Some of it will shock you, no doubt but it will also leave you saying, truth all of it is the honest truth.<br /><br />This story is simply awesome!  I don't even know what more to say about it.  Emma's got one brilliant mind, and I cannot wait for more books from her.  Her ability to tell a story from a man's POV is incredible... If there was a book that I would rate higher then a 5 star this would be it... Buy this book!  You won't be sorry!!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Romantic, Funny, great characters ! This book has it all. Look forward to more books from this author. Get this book.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Can't say I loved this one, but the approach was interesting. Good for those who like their movies very artsy.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|Bob Marley is a modivator for the masses seeking comfort and peace. I respect what he stood for and knowing I have bought the Live cd made 8Months before his death tells me he lives on through his music.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I did not realize how short a time frame this movie covered. It was, however, superb. Makeup was great as well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Graphics are great, hints are fast, story is good.works great on kindle fire.would recommend to anyone who enjoys hidden object games
B00BKBCF38|4.0|This is a rocking good time!  I never got into the first album; but I immediately latched onto Infestissumam.  People compare them to Blue Oyster Cult, I'm not very familiar with them so I can't comment.  But this definitely sounds like 70's rock, including the frequent use of organs.<br /><br />Tracks 1-3, 5 and 6 get stuck in my head for days!  And try not shaking your booty to Zombie Queen, that song is the best on here.<br /><br />Here's the problem:  why label this as explicit?  There isn't a single curse word on here.  This may scare away potential buyers!  Or hurt sales to customers who might be too young to purchase an \\"Explicit lyrics\\" album.  Get rid of the sticker guys!<br /><br />P.S.  To all who rate this album low because it's not metal:  do you write reviews of hip-hop or country albums and claim that they're not metal???  Then why do it here?  Stop being silly.  It's just too bad Amazon doesn't filter out troll reviews.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great graphics, sharp and realistic movements. The player movement could be better but I still give it 5 stars. The only thing I don't like is that you cannot find or earn more diamonds.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Have a great time playing. Get coins just by waiting as you check your mail or play another game. Lots of fun
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I'm completely hooked.  Similar to the original Puzzle Quest but with a sliding match 3.  I like the runner aspect that makes it new and different.  The classic look is fun for me but don't let it turn you away from a grat game.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk's new album reminds me of greatest 60s-80s funk songs - of Sly and the Family Stone, Herbie Hancock, Earth Wind & Fire, Rose Royce, etc. Anyone who likes funk music of 60s-80s should listen to this album. This album is a masterpiece.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Would have liked to have heard more details of his experience in the next sphere, instead of the urgency he felt to have the scientific community believe this was a true experience in him and in others. To those of us that believe in NDE's, that would have been more relative to us. Still a good book with many thought- provoking concepts presented.

B001KZG99A|5.0|Excellent movie! I recommend it for everyone no matter the type of movie you like best. It's worth watching the whole series.

B0043JDUNS|5.0|This movie was good but it didn't include much iron man suit up action. Still worth watching as nobody can beat Stark ;)
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game is good. But I wish that the game would be able show the same on my phone, Kindle, and computer. It gets frustrating playing the game three different ways and my score may not be the same on each device. On one I may have enough coins to play and when I play another I don't even have the same options.

1451695195|1.0|Most of the people behave like most Lawyers where they take the client first and assume he/she is innocent and then contend the case or collect evidence to support their client. Most people are looking at this book from their religious prejudices, In fact, there is no proof whatsoever or science in the book. Girl on butterfly wing, come on give me a break. Disappointing....
B0015ABRE2|5.0|For a very high energy piece of entertainment that has twists and turns and amazing amounts of \\"gotcha's\\", Dexter's series is the best.  Never thought I'd be one to root for a serial killer, but he is vigilante par excellence!  Now when we see hurtful evil people who spend their lives making others (animal or human) suffer, we comment that they need to be \\"Dexter-fied\\".
B000VUFJ3C|4.0|Even with just four of the original five members of Backstreet Boys left, it's still quite enjoyable to hear their special harmony and rhythms.  A really good listen, which I recommend.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|... or listen to the bad reviews. Apparently, it would've hindered my ability to enjoy this movie, which would've been a real shame. This is a fun, engaging, sometimes dark, sometimes funny, thrilling, visually stunning, coming of age film. The acting is superb. The storyline is fresh. Nothing like Twilight, FYI. I watched this with my fifty-year-old father. I'm twenty-six, and we both agreed this is a four star movie.<br /><br />If you haven't read the books, give it a shot. If you have, please try to keep an open mind. It would be a shame if they decided not to release a sequel due to all the poor reviews. Who knows, the coming sequel could be the perfect film for all you book fans.

0316113514|5.0|I don't rate this book 5 stars lightly. Out of the 20 or so books I've read in the last year, this one was top 3, and I tend to read very high quality books. Honestly, \\"Spark\\" should be required reading for everyone. Great book, great info, helpful to all. I can't recommend it enough.
B001TODCII|1.0|Put the dvd into our machine and told that does not read in our area. Had to open the packaging to try it, so can't be returned.
0684857219|5.0|After reading this body building encyclopedia, it quickly became apparent why it got the nick name &#34;The Bible Of Body Building&#34; because it is just that and much MORE. It's extremely useful to learn about injuries in it as well as just consulting this bible for just general or advanced gym knowledge. This book was money well spent and by far the best book to reference when ever I have a gym related question. I would RECOMMEND this book to my FRIENDS.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Can't be played and can't return it once opened packaging. Total waste of money. If discs can't be played in our area, why is there no instruction regarding such?
B00C1LIYWM|3.0|Okay, so I sat down with my sister - a big Nicholas Sparks fan - to watch SAFE HAVEN, even after not liking \\"The Lucky One\\" (Zac Efron aside, I just knew 20 minutes into that film where it was going). This one had a different quirk to it (the enraged, sociopath of a husband, determined to find his runaway wife), giving it more substance for me, and though you can tell how ANY Nicholas Spark book or film is going to end, this one held my interest. Worth it purely for chick-flick lovers, but nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be; the suspense elements were a nice change for a Sparks' story.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Joe is at it again with another killer album. i'm not gonna pretend that i am all knowing in music theory and mixing for a record, but i do know good music when i hear it. If you're a satch fan already this is obviously Joe's signature sound and every song is great. The actual song Unstoppable Momentum doesn't really have any momentum at all though hahaha. i was expecting the type of rhythm from satch boogie or surfing with the alien. But this is a very mellow album. i always listen to it at night to relax. Joe always knows how to speak through his guitar and i enjoy all his albums. i'm a true fan so i won't give negative comments about it. Awesome tunes, great tone, and pure Satch awesomeness. Pick this bad boy up and pop it in your cd player.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|I have to admit it, I liked \\"Mama'.<br /><br />In recent years, I've really gotten away from the gorier horror films that favor blood and body count over story or character or plot (with some exceptions, and this conversion is I think mostly to some of the more - and greater - Asian horror flicks I've fallen for).<br /><br />Just one reason, flawed as it is, that I really enjoyed 'Mama'. Sure, it goes for the cheap jump scares, but for me most of those still worked to great effect, and I found the film more than a bit creepy at times. The performances of Jessica Chastain and the two little girls really make the film, and even with the occasionally obvious CGI - and the plot holes that the film leaves behind - I was still greatly entertained and even loved the bittersweet ending.<br /><br />Kind of similar to the way I felt about 'Darkness Falls'; if you liked that one at all, you should like 'Mama'.
075669812X|5.0|Our son loves all things Lego and wanted this book for the Ninjago information as well as Lloyd, the green ninja.  He loves it.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|After 'Contagion' especially, I wanted to see SIDE EFFECTS for not just the cast but for director Steven Soderbergh. While this one is probably closer to 3-1/2 stars than four, it's still well-made and pretty engrossing, story-wise.<br /><br />The story seems simple enough - a young woman (Rooney Mara), suffering from depression after her husband (Channing Tatum) is released from several years in jail for insider trading, tries to commit suicide by smashing her car. A psychiatrist (Jude Law) she meets in the hospital ER becomes her therapist, eventually prescribing an experimental drug for her that results in side effects leading to a horrible tragedy.<br /><br />Initially you think this is the crux of the film - the controversy of how easily we (both patients and healthcare officials) will take any pill we think will cure all - but as with any Soderbergh film not everything (or everyONE) is what/who they seem, and the film evolves into a thriller with enough twists to make a pretzel maker happy (and the film worth seeing).<br /><br />While I loved the story, script and actors - and, ultimately, the film - at the same time I just felt the performances were (intentionally?) a little sterile, keeping me from getting emotionally close to any of the main characters (to some degree intentional, I think, but saying anything more would come to close to a spoiler). Ultimately a well-constructed, mean little film worth seeing, for sure. =0)
B000094HMU|5.0|I ordered this for my mom and she loves it! She has watched it several times and has positive praise!

B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset!  I walk around the house talking to people, it's so comfortable, and crisp and clear. Recommended to all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a big sci-fi fan, and this book was perfect for that. I also love enclosed thriller stories, and this collection reads a bit like that, with everything happening inside buried silo. The first story really pulls you in, and the rest follows very naturally. A must read.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have had this mouse for over 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. I had been using a microsoft sidewinder for years and loved it, but when it went bad I couldn't find anything to replace it with. I got the anker because it offers the weight system, as well as the silicon pads that make using it smooth moving. I use it for both graphic/web design work, and for gaming, and it works perfectly.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|When's the last time you read a tech book, cover to cover in 4 days? This book is a page turner for anyone involved in IT, and should be for anyone involved in business that is dependent on IT. Move over Dan Brown! The Phoenix Project is coming through. The Phoenix Project is a story of learning, mentoring and discovery, taking advantage of current thoughts on lean, kanban, devops, continuous integration, continuous deployment, continuous improvement and flow.<br /><br />If you're like me, you won't be able to put it down.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|This application does not work at all on a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Although you can get to the loading screen, it just loops back to the menu. I liked the original, so this was a huge disappointment.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I read this book in a single evening, and I was compelled to get to the reasons Hannah committed suicide. I enjoyed it, however, I am 15 years out of high school, and honestly thought that Hannah was a little out of touch with the reality of life. It was irritating how she wanted to blame everyone else for her suicide and when I finished all I thought was \\"well, that was a stupid reason to kill yourself\\"<br />I think it could be a good book for teens, and could open all sorts of conversations about how your actions affect other people, but as an adult, all I kept thinking was that the \\"reasons\\" she killed herself didn't make much sense in the grand scheme of things.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Awesome....Awesome.  What a great CD and his vocal talent is just wonderful and a joy to listen too.  So glad I purchased it.  Saw him perform on Ellen's TV talk show and went right out and bought the CD.  So glad I did.

B0018QOIXU|3.0|After listening to her popular and Grammy Winning CD, this one was a disappointment.  I believe this was released prior to her well known CD and in my opinion, it wasn't close to the lyrical or vocal quality.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I found myself completely swept away by the images in this book and the world it created. Not one moment was predictable, so I couldn't tear myself away because I wanted to know what was coming next or who was whom or why something happened. I was never disappointed, though sometimes saddened by the events... Which is what a good book should do:appeal to emotion, curiosity, and sense of self.

B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Fantastic tracklist. A recurring melody heard in several different songs is utilized in a way that both compliments their individuality while also reminding you that the best is still to come in the finale. Very impactful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this series and the amazing way the English have handling the most ticklish of situations.  We anxiously await the coming season!
0375703764|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read, it stands apart from all other literature.  I will never be able to forget.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's fun for all ages. I had it shut down and erase everything though, had to start all over but that was ok because I had a better concept of the game at that point. Hopefully it won't erase itself again that would drop the stars way down.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought it was an interesting and good story. It told me about parts of warfare that no one knows about.
B000007UTN|5.0|this is one of the best vinyl releases i have bought. the sound is second to none and the packaging is top quality. it is on 180g double vinyl and packaged in a gate fold cover with 2 inserts. if you have access to a turntable buy this, it could change your mind on how to listen to music.
B00499K9E0|5.0|There is a reason this series has a consistant 5 star rating. It is just that good. At first, I didn't know what I would make of the 21st century scene but it was in no way a distraction.  In fact, though I ADORE period pieces, it was such a breath of fresh air to see something so different for once. Now, let's talk Sherlock. Mr. Holmes is played to absolute perfection by Bendedict Cumberbatch. This was my first experience with this talented actor and I was pretty much hooked from his first words. His Sherlock is a genius, of course, witty, observant, slightly neurotic, and yes, an arrogant you-know-what at times. He is always sure of himself and is as cocky in his capabilities as one can get. You would think someone like that would be annoying as heck. I mean, he is nasty and flippant towards his landlady, has zero friends and pretty much ignores John Watson upon their first meeting. And yet...he simply draws you in. It's almost addictive in nature. You are holding your breath waiting for him to speak. And speak he does! Non-stop, fast-paced, without even taking a breath. That is his gift, and he is very proud of it. And then you get the rare moments of silence, when only his eyes speak volumes. It really can't be described properly and I don't dare do it justice. You simply have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />John Watson is played by the uber talented Martin Freeman. He is the exact opposite of Holmes. He is quieter, more down-to-earth and does his best to keep Sherlock in check. It doesn't always work, in fact it rarely does, but watching them onscreen together is magic. They have a wonderful rapport and it just gets progressively better as the series evolves.  It never gets personal (Sherlock won't let anyone get that close) but I love the subtle Are they, or Aren't they clues thrown in throughout. It's not even a major plotline, nor is it of importance but it's still amusing to wonder, even as the characters offer no further insight. Either way, they are afantastic duo and I applaud the casting choice.<br /><br />The actual mystery plotlines are all very intriguing and entertaining. They are based off some of the actual Sherlock Holmes stories, but are fresh to me since I've never read any of them (though now I simply have to!) Everything is done in a clever, almost over-the-top way that actually never gets old. There are a few surprises and twists and leaves you off on a cliffhanger(of course). The screenplay is fantastic, for Sherlock would not be the way he is without it. My only complaint- Just three episdoes. Granted they are close to two hours each but still... it is just that addictive.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|top quality sound and packaging. double 180g vinyl and gatefold cover, us cover, but i knew that when i bought it, excellent<br />booklet and notes. i am not a jimi nut so i prefer are you experienced. this has some great songs but also a lot of instrumental parts that i might skip on cd. that is the beauty of vinyl, albums become whole things and not a collection of bits. this is an album to be<br />listened to on vinyl and loud.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I didn't think it possible, but season 2 elevated my adoration for Sherlock. Picking up exactly where Season 1 left off, we quickly spiral towards another mystery. The first episode is probably my favorite in this season because we get a closer look at Sherlock, and witness something we haven't before. A female advisary for Holmes, who may, or may not be smitten with the detective. Naturally, Holmes won't make it THAT easy for the viewer to guess what he's thinking, but by the end of the episode, we catch a glimmer of something... I will leave it at that because it's always more fun to watch it for yourself. Episode 2 features the infamous Hound of Baskerville. It is probably the weakest episode in terms of character development but again, we get to witness something special when Holmes and Watson are on screen together. Episode 3 is a real nail-biter and leaves you emotionally drained and at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />What is there left to say about Benedict Cumberbatch that hasn't already been said?  He is even better this season than he was the last, if you can believe that. The dead-pan humour, intense stare (which even Watson remarks on) is magnified here, without ever seeming over-the-top. He even smiles more here! He is still as arrogant and impatient as ever, finding fault with whomever is in his vision and bringing them down to size. Though he is starting to realize he probably shouldn't be so harsh to absolutely everyone he meets, and we see some of the reprocussions that can happen when his mouth runs away with him.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes, simple but so nice. I especially love Sherlock's overcoat and blue scarf, which he never seems to forget to wear, even in a dire situation. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, and I can't wait to see what season three brings. Sherlock Holmes is not only a superb show, but a wonderful character, who now, has easily become one of my favorite characters ever on screen.I can't recommend this series enough.
B002WY64HA|5.0|excellent packaging and vinyl, this is an album to sit back and take in in 1 go, so vinyl is ideal, its harder to skip to your favorite track which i do with cds & mp3. this album while not as good as the suburbs has some of their best songs on. fans of bands like arcade fire would appreciate the superior packaging & sound of vinyl over a cd. i do not understand how people buy digital music when you can have this for not much more.
0786955570|5.0|This is a very fun game, and a great introduction to the mechanics of D&D RPGs and actually it served as a basics refresher for me having not played D&D since I was a kid. The tiles and figures add to the theme's feel. Arguably the tiles could have been illustrated with more detail and variety (I'm thinking of Descent's gorgeous tiles), but they're pretty nice and made from a sturdy stock. The figures are fantastic, except for (disappointingly), Vlad himself, who looks the furthest thing from imposing, especially when compared to the bone dragon or any of the heroes. Kinda looks like Seth Green wearing clothes that are too big for him, unfortunately. Gameplay is not terribly complicated but you will have to invest a little time with the rulebook (or fans' youtube videos), especially if you've had no D&D experience. Once you do, the game is immensely fun and satisfying, and the creepy theme really shines (oozes?) through, but I will warn you it is challenging. You will find yourself cheating a bit in the first few games, because you didn't realize you should have done some other action prior but didn't know the game well enough, or just because it's a hard game but you want to go a little further to see what's ahead. For example in the first solo game, the game ends when you finally get to the Secret Staircase. If you're lucky enough to have this tile be at the top of your stack, you're golden. You'll fight a few monsters and win. But more often than not, you'll be turning over tile after tile and the monsters don't stop coming. You'll be wondering where that #$^$^ tile is. If it's near the bottom, you're screwed (and I hope you have enough table space. There are a dozen or so missions, with varying difficulty and objectives and there are even a couple you can download from their website. And like all D&D there's nothing stopping you from making up your own. It's a fantastic game, that's fun with others or even by yourself as you'll discover when you do that first mission just to learn the game. Trying to decide if I want to buy the other two games in this series or if they're too similar, but I'm having a great time with Ravenloft.
B000AHJJDM|5.0|great album great band. top quality pressing on double vinyl, 3 sides used for album, side 4 has an exclusive song (talking like turnstiles). you will find yourself finishing side 4 and going back to side 1. how are they not more popular, the majority of people have no taste so brilliant bands like death cab and the shins get little airplay.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|This book was selected by my book club and I'm not much of one for the supernatural or unexplainable phenomenon. But this was a bit of a different twist on it and I enjoyed the different personalities in the book. However, for a long-ish book, I kept feeling like I was getting a short-cut of the story. It was a complex story and I had the feeling the author had a deep understanding of some of the elaborate plans and events but, in an effort not to bore the reader, some of the underpinnings got lost. It will probably make a visually stunning movie--scenes and events can drive a movie. In a book, I want to know and understand the characters. There were plenty of characters and most of them were quite interesting but I didn't feel I was given enough insight into what they were doing and why to love (or hate) them.

B0091V6TJ0|5.0|it isn't as engaging as their albums but it is a thrill to hear some material from the vaults. there are moments of pure genius and there are some moments numbing monotony. it has been suggested elsewhere that this collection could have been edited down to an album's worth of material. i suppose that's fair, but even with some of the excess here, it still leaves you wanting more. imagining if there was ever anything that didn't even make it to tape or worse, was accidentally recorded over. could you strip away the layers to reveal the material beyond the lost tapes...okay, maybe that is a bit much...however, millionspiel, is as good as anything on any can record and better than some.<br /><br />the packaging is nice, this is well worth the price. not a suggested starting point if you have never heard can but for those who have listened to the records and still want more, (and more) here they are. the final embers from the dying star.
B004EPZ03Y|1.0|I sent this movie as a gift to a friend for her birthday, she was so excited to get it. Both the DVD and Blue Ray were defective and did not play. They both had strange marks on them.

Now I found out the return date is too late and we are stuck with a horrible birthday present!

1400096936|3.0|This is the 3rd book I have read by this author. He never fails to entertain, but why can't someone more closely edit his books? He ALWAYS gets the firearms stuff wrong. He's so bad at it that it hurts me to read. Since they feature so prominently in his work, you would think someone would help him out, or that he would have an expert check his facts. It's irritating to have such glaring errors in otherwise outstanding material.<br /><br />DON! PLEASE! STOP!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I have been using another product for years and saw the add for this one.

0345529057|3.0|I must preface by saying that I love the series and my issue is not with the story. I recommend reading this series, it is thrilling and it is hard to put the books down to go to bed.<br /><br />What I don't like about this product is the manner in which they decided to design the physical book itself. They made the books too compact for the amount of pages the series contains. The book is small, it has tiny margins, and my hand sometimes hurts from holding such an awkward book. I recommend purchasing a set of books that are full-sized.

193700788X|2.0|Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />I have been a huge fan of Charlaine Harris's novels going back to the Shakespeare series and beyond. I have been following Sookie Stackhouse's story from the beginning. I am telling you this you can understand my deep disappointment in this book. So many things didn't make sense. After everything Sookie and Eric have been through he's just leaving? Without a fight? And to add to the confusion she ends up Sam's arms! The only thing I could figure is that he's the rebound guy. There were so many inexplicable things happening and loose ends I can't begin to describe them. Either Ms. Harris had a ghost writer for this book or she phoned it in.
B000L53D4O|3.0|We used the Fisher-Price Bright Beginnings Activity Walker at our house and my mom bought a similar walker to use at her house. She bought the [[ASIN:B0053X62GK VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker (Frustration Free Packaging)]] This is my comparison of the two toys. The Fisher-Price toy is lighter in weight. It is actually a lot lighter. When my son was just learning to walk, we actually placed a football inside the walker to help weigh it down. Otherwise, he was constantly tipping it up as he walked and falling down. It is in need of more weight at the bottom to really support a beginning walker. The VTech toy doesn't have that problem. It is much more sturdy. My son likes the toys on the front of the Vtech much better.  He is crazy about the little barn door!  We also like that you can remove the toys and use them separately. Since both toys are about the same price, I think the VTech version wins hands-down!

B000001GPX|2.0|The orchestra's performance is fine, but this CD seems to end the third movement of the 5th Symphony abruptly, not letting notes die out naturally. For the other movements it allows a second or two after the music ends, so there's no problem with them sounding cut off.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Every mechanic works well, the game keeps you engrossed. Some of the building prices are a tad high for the income levels, but whatever. Combat is simple, but the PvP can be stupid with the enemies having a lower rank than you but better tech.

B000I5XOW8|5.0|The Fugitive is a classic in my opinion, but this is not a movie review.  As far as the product itself, there isn't much other than the disc, no endless special features, etc.  But if you just want the movie, this is a great purchase.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I was looking forward to watching the DVD. Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln was quite refreshing. Particularly interesting were his little quips peppered throughhhout the movie. However, many scenes were so loud (being battle scenes for the most part, but also just some high-volume arguments among characters), that it took away much of the enjoyment that I was anticipating from the movie. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't think I'll do so again.
B00005V9IL|4.0|Pretty basic.  It comes with the movie on dvd in the case, not much else.  If you want the basics, this is a good buy.  Would be cool if it were on bluray though.

B003BWERF8|3.0|It's a shame apple didn't include bluetooth by default on the 6th generation. However for an additional 50 bucks this device mostly solves that oversight. Yes it sucks the nano battery dry in just a few hours, but unless you are cycling a century or running a marathon it'll last through most workouts.<br />The good: it syncs up with my headphones quickly and easily (most of the time)<br />The bad: about 25% of the time when I plug it in, the nano \\"freaks out\\". By freaking out I mean nothing happens for about 30 seconds then I get an \\"unsupported device\\" message on the nano. The only fix I have found so far it to unplug, and try again. Usually after about 15 minutes or so it'll start working<br />The ugly: I have to pair my headphones every time I want to use it.

B000001FO4|5.0|There are very few perfect albums. Cinderella's Long Cold Winter is an amazing combination of rock, blues, and Tom Keifer's killer vocals, making this work an instant classic. From an age where artistry and an ENTIRE album, all of the songs, still mattered this is a true gem. One can't go wrong spending money on this album.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|When I started this game I was mystified by the graphics. As I was playing, I saw that it gave me a challenge at first. Then I started getting it. It was a great game. I would definitely buy another of this type.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I really don't care much if a movie has a deeper meaning or some hidden message. Entertain me and I am happy and this movie does well. Quinton did it again, I just love his movies and soundtracks to them. Want some fun? Watch Django.

B00B7VZN76|4.0|This is an excellent set and I look forward to all the other Start Trek Series coming out on Blu-Ray.  Plenty of interesting special features and trivia.<br /><br />I do find it strange however how they went all out on the original series with DTS HD MA 7.1 and the ability to alternate between original special effects and the newly created ones whereas the subsequent releases only had DTS HD MA 5.1 and no offering to compare original footage with any new footage that may or may not have been introduced into these new releases.
1442474440|4.0|I chose to read this book because I will always be a kid at heart. It was filled with action, drama, and most importantly, adventure. The reviews and comments on this book from both publishers and fellow readers have given me positive feedback and influence in choosing this book. This book will always keep the kid and sense of adventure alive in me.<br /><br />This novel is about Jim, a young boy going on a dangerous adventure with pirates in search of treasure. One of the many themes in Treasure Island is \\"The lack of adventure in modern age\\" explained in the quote \\"Now I felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind.\\" Jim enjoys acting on his sense of exploration and adventure for the first time-- he lacked that joy and hasn't experienced anything like that back at home. The quote and the theme of \\"the lack of adventure in the modern age\\" shows how the present doesn't address and satisfy the needs of Jim. He is filled with curiosity and adventure, which as a young boy he feels is in the ideal life of pirates, treasure, and danger  that is lacking in today's society.<br /><br />Throughout the book a recurring word was the word \\"black,\\"  for example \\"...but what is the black spot, captain?\\" The world black was used as a sign of death, pirates, evil, and blindness throughout the book. Stevenson used the word \\"black\\" to express the life of pirates.<br /><br />This book would be classified as a young adult literature, fiction, adventure fiction, in the form of a novel.  I agree with the customer review that this indeed is the classic pirate's tale. I would recommend this book to others because I believe this is a classic tale that everyone's life should be affected with, just like it affected me. I believe that this book will inspire people to go out and seek adventure. I would recommend this book for everyone of every age.<br /><br />TJHS Senior 2013

0765334798|5.0|If you loved the Original Series Star Trek, or any movie where you can tell that someone is going to bite the dust early on, this book is for you!

He mixes science fiction with &#34;reality&#34; and makes us care about the characters; even the ones who die early on!!

B00BR9WRC2|5.0|AWESOME, FANTASTIC, THEY HAVE TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT THIS BOOK!!<br />Rainbow Rowell is truly a gifted writer. I totally enjoyed this book, even though it was for young adults, (bless her soul). I am an adult and I must say this...'it captivated me from the beginning to the end'.  Please make a movie about this book.  Are there any men like Park left in this world?  Probably not, because that is why Eleanor kept him for herself.  Way to go Eleanor!  Park is a true gentleman, friend, lover, etc....he makes me smile when I say his name out loud.  Anybody, whatever age you are will enjoy this book.<br />Now Rainbow, how about a sequel, huh?  Will Park and Eleanor get back together some time in the future and pick up where they left off?  And if I was Eleanor, I would have ran away from home a long time ago, taking my siblings and mom, but BEFORE I put Ex-Lax in her dad's food.  Isn't that evil enough, no I don't think so with all he put Eleanor, siblings and mom through.

B003TGMFG4|4.0|After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" many years ago, I became very interested in this author's work.  I was incredibly impressed with the story, the writing, and the journalistic integrity.  As I read other books by him, it just reinforced my opinion of the author and I reached the point that if he published it, I read it.  This particular book originally came out in 1997 and I promptly bought a copy and quickly read the entire thing.  Recently, I knew I was going to be taking several long drives and borrowed the audio copy from my local library so I could revisit it since it has been over 15 years since my original exposure.<br /><br />There really is no need for me to describe the story or subject matter since there are so many reviews and many do such a nice job.  I would like to share a bit of my reaction to the book my second time through.  I think many people outside of the climbing community first became acquainted with Mr. Krakauer as the world became fascinated with the disaster on Mt. Everest and his documentation of that event.  This book is different in that there were no first-hand witnesses to what happened to Chris McCandless - he just walked into the bush and never came out.  This book tries to piece together Chris's experience based upon folks he met over the previous couple of years as well as graffiti and a journal that he kept.  There isn't the high drama of the Everest book since the situation is very different however, the drive to push oneself beyond the limits of what \\"normal\\" human beings experience is prominent in both events.  The author spends quite a bit of time drawing a picture of Chris's life/family/viewpoints to help the reader come to understand how someone could make the decisions this young man made.<br /><br />I firmly believe that Mr. Krakauer makes a sincere and honest attempt to portray the events with as little bias as is humanly possible.  While some folks may view the book as unduly flattering to Chris, my impression is that it isn't flattering, just honest.  This isn't a young man who woke up one day and decided to leave everything behind and walk into the woods of Alaska and die.  One thought or decision lead to another and then another - step by step he moved in this direction with a catastrophic outcome.  He may have been young and impulsive but very few people grow into adulthood without looking back at decisions we all made and cringe at the possible outcome.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite Krakauer book, but it still was definitely worth a second read (and a third may be in my future).n't flattering, just honest.

0399162097|5.0|Rosemary Cooke comes from a normal Midwestern family: mother, psych professor dad, brother Lowell, and sister Fern.  Except that Fern is a chimpanzee.  It seems Dad took the psych experiment to the extreme, raising a chimp and a daughter the same.  Well, the same except for the fact that Fern can climb trees, swing from branches, trash a house, and eat things from auntie's purse.<br /><br />Then, a little before Fern and Rosemary's 6th birthday, Fern is removed from their home.  Rosemary is sent off to stay with relatives.  When she returns, Fern is gone, and pretty much not spoken of again.  Her mother falls into a deep dark depression.  Her brother acts out and finally departs, after turning all of Dad's lab rats loose.  Dad immerses himself in more research and more alcohol and becomes more defensive.  And Rosemary must learn to act like a human, meaning no grooming her classmates' hair, biting, or jumping on furniture.<br /><br />Rosemary is grown now, a student at UC Davis.  She's funny and smart and angry and frustrated and piecing together memories to understand what happened so long ago, and what is happening now.  She's trying to find Lowell, and find herself.<br /><br />The book is absolutely wonderful.  Rosemary's voice is humorous as well as insightful, and even without the message, it would be an enjoyable read.  But it is so much more.<br /><br />Here, then, are the Top Ten Things That are Great About \\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\\":<br /><br />10.  If you like Sara Gruen's \\"Ape House,\\" you will love \\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves.\\"<br /><br />9.  Karen Joy Fowler tells a funny story.  Yes, it's a serious book but face it: life is funny, even when it's awful.  Fowler sees that and gives us situations and dialogue and perceptions to remind us.<br /><br />8.  Fowler writes great characters.  Each is unique, and with dimension.  They feel very real, from Rosemary \\"Monkey Girl\\" Cooke to her new-found \\"friend\\" who moves into the apartment, drinks all the beer, and goes bar-hopping with a waylaid ventriloquist's dummy.<br /><br />7.  I always like to come away with a new body of information when I read fiction.  Fowler sprinkles a lot of science and psychology into the book without being heavy-handed.<br /><br />6.  Fowler seasons her writing with words you rarely get to read in a book (much less hear in conversation).  Refulgent!  Catachresis!  Ithyphallic! Grab your dictionaries and have some fun.<br /><br />5.  There are few writers who can describe the feel of California's Central Valley like Fowler.<br /><br />4.  Fowler explores that permeable layer between memory and reality.  Was it real or remembered?  Is the memory something one has been told or was it actually witnessed?  Rosemary tries to understand her past based on memories and the few facts she can cobble together.  Reality is remarkably elusive.<br /><br />3.  Fowler can really write.  The words flow together.

B000MKD9P6|5.0|Great movie.  I've watched it a couple of times and it's really cute.  Meryl Streep plays a great character... and she's beautiful.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|Awesome story, well drawn, sucks you in and keeps you entertained throughout... I would recommend it to anyone who loves anime..
B002ZG99N6|5.0|one of the best i've seen-great cast, story and action. if you like drama-try it out!<br />you'll love it. great
B00BIVN82M|5.0|It seems a bit self-defeating to me that you cannot merely accept a star rating without insisting on an accompanying narrative.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A heart wrenching story of atrocity difficult to comprehend!  Human rights in places like North Korea can only be changed by a vigilant prayer effort across America and the world.  All things are possible with GOD...that's how he made it out alive!
B00BIVN82M|2.0|Michael Buble  usually knows his musical lane and makes it work, however here he bowls a gutter ball.  he has a good voice and usually when he does his own  what I call \\"Starbucks\\" type of music it works, however here, he seems like he is audtioning  for a Modern day  Cheese Factory gig in Las Vegas at any costs. these arrangements and vibes of the songs with his voice make him sound old and like he is desperate for a hit with a bad  toupee  and he is trying to be cool in a lounge kind of way. this  album is boring and flat.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|How can you not love Jimmy Stewart... and especially in a Hitchcock thriller... Seriously, good movie.  My Husband doesn't normally like &#34;old&#34; movies but he watched it with me and liked it too.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|The story is wonderful. The cast amazing. The kid is great! The photography is beautiful. British film at its best!
B00CW665VI|5.0|5 totally super deserved stars!!<br /><br />Funny, hot, romantic and intense! Chase provides an amazing, blunt, pragmatic and hilarious male POV!<br /><br />\\"I'm not the kind of guy who rides the same rollercoaster twice. Once is enough, and then the thrill is gone and so is the interest\\".<br /><br />I'm so happy I listened to recommendations and gave this book a go! An amazing debut novel that is perfectly written and provided one of the best hero's POV's ever! I really appreciate a new author and even more when you can see natural and awe inspiring talent!! I so envy you Emma!!! (in a super good way)<br /><br />I really enjoyed Drew's thoughts and all those insane things that came out of his mouth (and what he did with it too, of course) *grins*. I can tell you that I didn't miss being in the head of the heroine; on the contrary, for once I was relieved at not having to read about the emotion rollercoaster that is a woman's mind.<br /><br />Drew is our typical pig :) charming, handsome, young, sexy, successful, rich and a player... of course. And then Kate comes along and turns his world upside down.<br /><br />\\"Her warm, soft hand slides perfectly into mine, and two thoughts enter my head simultaneously. The first is: God hates me. The second is: I have been a naughty, naughty boy for most of my life, and this is my payback. And you know what they about payback right?  Yep. She's one hairy bitch\\".<br /><br />The enemies to lovers theme is one of my favorites and believe me when I say that the rant and the competition between these two was funny as hell.<br /><br />\\"Then I flip Kate the finger. Immature, I know, but apparently we're now both functioning at the preschool level, so I'm guessing it's okay\\".<br /><br />This book is a must read for any contemporary romance reader out there.<br /><br />More quotes I loved:<br /><br />\\"Actually my dreams involve you bending over something...not bowing. She makes a disgusted sound. \\"Could you be any more of a pig\\".<br /><br />\\"Anyone worth doing, is worth doing well.\\"<br /><br />\\"Edward Cullen can take his stupid heroin and OD on it. Kate is my own personal brand of Viagra\\".<br />BEST LINE EVER!!!br />\\"Anyone worth doing, is worth doing well.\\"<br /><br />\\"Edward Cullen can take his stupid heroin and OD on it. Kate is my own personal brand of Viagra\\".<br />BEST LINE EVER!!!
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|The sixth studio album from melodic metalcore pioneers Killswitch Engage finds the band returning to form. This involves Jesse Leach, the band's initial and one-time lead singer, returning to the fold for the first time since the group's watershed-worthy sophomoric 2002 effort, \\"Alive Or Just Breathing.\\" Therefore, the effort, entitled \\"Disarm The Descent,\\" makes fans of ex-frontman Howard Jones think twice before saying that that frontman had the better pair of pipes. (Leach's are every bit as accomplished and dynamic. They are plenty soulful, too.) And plus, KsE arrive at the corner of some instrumental growth throughout the record, too. In addition to conjuring up another batch of amazing riffage (some of the best of their career!), six-stringers Adam Dutkiewicz and Joel Stroetzel write and pull-off a handful of emphatic guitar solos, and do so to surprisingly successful effect.<br /><br />The record opens with a fairly prototypical Killswitch epic. \\"The Hell In Me\\" kicks off with a hardcore-derived bellow of \\"go!\\" followed by a sparks-spitting deluge of furious, At The Gates-styled riffing and punishing blast beats. This, then, flows perfectly into the tunes melodic choruses, which are so soulful and sweet that they put Soilwork to shame (and even rival the works of vintage Opeth). A brief but nice acoustic intro enters the fray near the end of the track, but a scorching pick slide ensues soon thereafter, thus bringing the bullying thrash back in all of its glory. \\"Disarm\\"'s trio of singles (\\"Beyond The Flames,\\" \\"In Due Time,\\" and \\"Turning Point\\"), are, naturally, three other standout-worthy tracks. The first of the bunch boasts a familiarly catchy and fiery thrash gallop comprised of hot thrash licks and tight, precise, and bruising drums. But the song, of course, makes room for plenty of deliciously clean crooning, cooing. And its melodic choruses are huge enough that they require their own zip code, too! The second song of the bunch is another extraordinarily infectious number that balances blowtorch riffs with more soulful and sweet vocal harmonies. And the very respectable guitar solo (which is very steep and mazy) that is uncorked, here, seems like just the icing on the cake. And lastly, a somber, minor-key melody introduces the final song in the above-named batch. But the rest of the band storm onto the scene with some really, really thunderous riffs and beats. They also uncork another memorable and ripping guitar solo, here, as well -- but this one differs from the ones heard on the rest of the record in that it is surprisingly technical.<br /><br />Elsewhere, there is an increased hardcore-mentality present on some of the other tracks. Take \\"The New Awakening,\\" for example. Its distinctly hardcore mentality, straight-forward, heads-down chugging, and tough guy-sounding vocal patterns would not be out of place on a Bury Your Dead joint. The song differs from that band's, however, on account of it featuring some nice guitar harmonies (which help to further its melodic choruses, and make them even more memorable). And it also is highlighted by another guitar solo -- tasty, fiery, and ripping, this just might be KsE's best solo to date! And plus, a track like \\"A Tribute To The Fallen\\" sounds similar, as it adopts a heavy hardcore fervor, and is mainly centered around head-banging, pit-stoking, lock-step-unison rhythms and crunching riffs. But in a nod to the band's metal roots, \\"Tribute\\" also lets another very respectable solo fly.<br /><br />\\"All We Have\\" is another album highlight, as it is a thunderous and bullying, hardcore-influenced bruisers with whiplash tempo'ing, blasting, and thrash beats that segue into deliciously melodic, harmonic-guitar-aided choruses. The song is also noteworthy for featuring some positively, uh, positive lyrics from Jesse (Leach supply sings lines like \\"forgiveness is all we have\\"). Another equally as memorable cut is \\"You Don't Bleed For Me,\\" which features one of the album's best andmost infectious choruses (and when you consider the competition that it is up against, that is REALLY saying something!). And they are all surrounded by more fiery, bone-crunching guitar chugging and bashing skins. But the following song, \\"The Call,\\" is even more of a standout because it reaches near black/death metal ferocities and intensities complete with scalding, machine gun riffing, and walloping drum blasts. (The drumming is of particular note, here, as it reaches almost mind-boggling levels of hyper-kinesis at times.)<br /><br />Finally, there is one last group of songs, every one of them very good. \\"No End In Sight\\" offsets nastily chugging, abrasively grinding, Pantera-worthy chugging thrash/groove metal riffs with a hook-heavy, harmonic chorus that wouldn't sound out of place coming from the likes of Stone Sour. Killswitch Engage then proceed to flesh out their melodic muscle on the subsequent \\"Always,\\" a slow-burning brooder, and a piece of entirely cleanly-sung modern rock balladry which finds the bass coming into the spotlight (it features an ominously grumbling bass intro.) But then, the band, of course, rev up the engines once again with \\"Time Will Not Remain,\\" which finds Jesse screaming \\"let's go!\\" over a bed of busy, thrashy picking and pummeling drums.<br /><br />\\"Disarm The Descent\\" defines what it means for a band to return to form. But at the same time, it also shows signs of musical growth and maturity. Hence, it is a mix of both potent old and refreshingly new-sounding material. And it works.most infectious choruses (and when you consider the competition that it is up against, that is REALLY saying something!).

1609611543|4.0|I read this book &#34;after&#34; I had been without wheat and sugar for almost a month. I simply woke up one day and felt as if A Huge Weight had been lifted from my shoulders! A friend called it &#34;feeling weightless&#34;! It was as if I was given a Giggle Pill! Truly! I was smiling ear to ear! I do not remember being this happy for Decades!<br /><br />I had no idea I was in a &#34;Drugged Out Fog&#34; until I stepped out of it! I had NO idea! I cannot even find words to express how happy and CLEAR I feel! It IS amazing! And I gave up both wheat and sugar merely as an &#34;experiment&#34; to find out if they were really making me tired or causing the swelling in my legs and weight gain. It was purely a &#34;personal experiment&#34;. Well I am here to say that what the doctor says is Clearly True in many areas. I agree with what most people shared in their 5 star reviews.<br /><br />My removal of one star has to do with his recommendations about eating meat. I eat a little chicken from my health food store, that visits the places where they source the chicken (and other meats they carry). They live their lives with plenty of fresh air and sunshine and no chemicals.  While Mr. Davis tells us to avoid most grains, including wheat, corn and soy totally, these same grains are fed to the animals he suggests eating!!<br /><br />He recommends &#34;grass fed&#34; animals, however, even legally labeled &#34;grass fed&#34; cattle are almost always finished with grains in the last weeks of their life! Pigs eat a variety of grains I found out, including corn, rye and wheat in some states! Pasture fed chicken are often supplemented with corn and other grains. If all these grains have been altered, which I believe they have been, then &#34;I&#34; would think it would not be wise to eat a lot of meat from animals who cannot AVOID eating the very grains we have been told to avoid ourselves!<br /><br />I simply do not feel the animals are somehow not affected in some way, as humans are. I know that the &#34;growth hormones&#34; given animals has resulted in girls having their menstrual periods earlier and earlier in many cases. There is a connection between the food and chemicals we feed the animals we eat, the conditions they live in, how they are killed, and how they are utilized and digested by our bodies. That I feel is lacking in this, otherwise, good book.s are.

B00BDSRISA|3.0|i ain't even going to lie i got into this band  because when they first came out they mentioned how much they dug R.Kelly and  recently he got on stage with them at Coachella  and turned the Joint together.  now fast forward to this album and i wish they could have done something together  because the Phoenix  while a talented band, sound like a  good  2nd tier  80's synth  based act which there ain't a thing wrong with that,  however it leaves very room for songwriting.  \\"the  real thing\\" which samples prince's drums  from  when doves cry for instance is  a  reflection of a Band being told to or seemingly forced into sounding like a 80's type based vibe as to them just winging it.  now this same band live  is  real tight and on point.<br /><br />the title track is cool as is entertainment,however  there  first album  moved me  more so. i hope they get to do there thing and not be  limited by the big wigs.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|I like to think I can figure out how a movie is going to end pretty quickly... This had me confused but it turned out really good.  How old is Liam Neeson?  Seriously... he must be in great shape or use a double for everything.  This was a pretty good movie.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|the cast is outstanding. The theme is fabulous... the depiction of India is acurate and amazing... the different life stories are all very moving and 100% believable<br /><br />I have watched this movie already 5 times and except for The Matrix and the Harry Potter series I very, very seldom watch a movie more than twice
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I had previously purchased an Anker battery pack, having not known anything about the brand.  Their low prices sold me, but after receiving and using the product I fell in love with it.  This gamer mouse was my second purchase from Anker, made in large part because of how happy I had been with the first product I tried from them.<br /><br />I had been getting frustrated with a wireless mouse both for work as well as gaming.  It was older, and I seemed to have to spend a lot of time coaxing it along to get work done.  I did a quick search for a new higher precision mouse thinking that might help, and this Anker product came up right away.  Great price, wired (I wanted to try for awhile due to all the wireless mouse issues I had) and it looked cool.  For those reasons I figured it was worth a shot just to see if it would help.<br /><br />Once again Anker came through on this one.  If you look closely at their products, you can tell they are very careful where they use material.  They appear to be quite good at putting together designs that are low cost.  But whereas most companies attempting this would fall into the category of \\"cheap\\" and suffer for it, Anker instead really seems to go the extra mile on function and design which I really love.  Even small touches like the sleeved-like wire are just really quite nice and add to the look.<br /><br />Out of box it works extremely well (better than what I need.)  For CAD and games it has been wonderful.  Again I underestimated them, and was very pleasantly surprised when I set it down and started using it.  I personally found the fit and feel of this mouse to be excellent.  Everything seems to be in just the right spot, and its just very comfortable to use.<br /><br />Using their drivers you can also change LED coloration of the mouse, which is a bit of fun as it looks nice sitting next to my Alienware.  An important note here is that only the palm Anker symbol appears to offer the color changing and \\"breathing\\" effects.This might annoy some people, however even though the remaining fore lights are blue it still looks very nice in my opinion.  Software features also allow you to select and customize mouse response based on button selection (the small LED along the rim you see in the picture shows you which mode you are in which is a very nice touch.)  Its extremely easy to change features on the buttons as well, and includes macro recording (which I don't use, but its nice to know its there).<br /><br />A set of tiny palm weights are also included with this mouse.  You can insert them into a foam holder located behind a panel in the base of the mouse.  I didn't think too highly of these at first, but after playing around a little bit with it I did like adding a little bit extra weight to it.  It also appears like fishing sinkers would fit well in there too if you really want to put in some added mass.<br /><br />I haven't used my other wireless mouse since.  I've been yet again surprised by Anker on this purchase.  I typically don't like reviewing either but felt the need to in this case just because I have been so impressed by them.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a well written, funny, sarcastic, sexy male POV book! Drew Evans is a banker with a cocky attitude and his drop dead gorgeous looks just make him a man woman dont turn down, well all but 1. Kate Brooks is engaged and new at Drew's firm and wants nothing to do with Drew and his man whore ways. I am going to guess right now you are saying, yeah yeah I have read that story line in a lot of books, but rarely do you read it from the guys POV and what is the over the top best thing in the book, is Drew's inner monologue as the story is told. I would have to stop to laugh while reading and I would just shake my head in agreement with some of his observations, including teaching me a new term NILF LOL .....you will have to read the book to know what the N is for lol ... loved this book! I cant recommend it more!
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game is amazing. Plays like the original. 5 stars all the way. The game controls are also good I recommend this game to everyone
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|What a waste of my money.  This CD is vulgar.  I partially listened to it once and realized what a mistake I had made.  I will never listen to it again.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Would recommend. Kept you guessing. John<br />Grisham back where he belongs in his writing. Glad I read it.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I can't figure . Out how to use this as 'll. May be . My dumb brain but??? I don't have a camera in my kindle but it downloads to me. I figured it must work somehow but I haven't figured out ho w yet. Probably works great on smart phones. Which is why I gave it 3 stars. It's simple, seems enjoyable brushless to the kindle...so why do they make . It for my machine??
B0031RSA24|4.0|Preaching to the converted it does in spades, but it might also &#34;convert&#34; some deluded people who still truly believe in god an give some cogent arguments for dropping their faith to the uncertain. Very well written. A quick read without being preachy.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very cool graphics. Although would like to be able to view a map from this as well. All in all very cool.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I loved this series and this is by far the best one yet can't wait till the next one comes out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game. addicted.  its s lot similar to the old farmville we used to love on facebook. they changed their game and couldn't enjoy it anymore until this app.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|A great album from start to finish. If you are a fan of Florence and the Machine already, it would be surprising if you don't already own it. If you aren't already a fan, give it a listen. It is the best introduction to their music!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a fun game my whole family like t o play. It's good exercise or therapy for people with dexterity issues. I had hand surgery and it helped me more thanks so it was fun, challenging and healthy. It also as o game my grandson (5) lots . If giggles as he constantly whipped me at this game. Good small motor hand eye coordination exercise for the little ones just dev e liking it. Good buy. Worth purchasing the paid app not just the free download.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great special effects, great acting and story! The movie is based on the Aliens mythology and it is given a different twist on this movie. Those loving great science fiction will have a blast of fun!
0151001820|3.0|I actually liked the movie the story was based on (The Ninth Gate) better than the book.  The book was written well enough but the plot was rather weakened by coupling the characters' obsession with Dumas and his Three Musketeers characters with the book used to summon the Devil.  The movie offered a much tighter plot.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Still such a great movie after all these years! A truly inspiring classic! Introduced it to the kids and now they love it!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played on my nexus 7. It&rsquo;s classic match 3, like bejeweled, taken toba new level. The different tiles do different things when matched, so timing matters. Also there's an upgrade system to give you something to work towards.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi is one of my fave artists and I absolutely loved her new album- it has both fun pop songs that are fun to dance to but also deep, raw, and emotional songs. it has something for everyone.. u can really feel her emotions on this album.. her best album yet, in my opinion. I think this can be enjoyed by every age group- but mainly for teens- young adults.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|it is a good game u should get it right now witch I didn't have to right so much on this stupid thing
B000QRIGLC|5.0|By the time I was through I was bawling like a baby. Truly moving story! I grew up on Seal Beach in Coronado so it brought back memories of my youth.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Love this band young and talented bought the second album already. cant wait for the next one to come out hopefully it wont take 2 years
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Nice graphics. Fun. I spent more time on this than I planned but it was hypnotic and drew me in.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay let me just start by saying I love Drew! He is HILARIOUS! I LOVE that we get a story like this, from a man's point of view. And he's such a slut.. and honest about it! .. and did I mention hilarious!?!!? He knows he's a play boy, one wink and he gets what he wants..he's so up front about it.I mean literally there were times where this was me... Oh my god, do men really talk like this?? Did he just.. bahahaah..But then he meets Kate and his slutty little world stops spinning. Everything starts to revolve around Kate. Work, play, everything. They get set up to work against one another.. and he's so childish.And this starts the show down. With work, and with play.It is like one of those scenarios where you fight so much, not only fighting at work, but your attraction .. then BOOOM! It erupts. Epic! And there is some cute kissing.. and some more kissing.. definitely angry kissing...BUT WAIT.. she's engaged. Problem, right? We get there, don't worry. He tells us the WHOLE story. And it's worth every page. Because when they finally do... ya know.. knock `dem boots..YOWZA! I'm not going to give spoilers.. SPOILER FREE ZONE!! .. but I will say.. Holy Cow, do they manufacture Drews anywhere? Once he sets his mind to something he wants... ummm... yeah.. can I have one to go? This was HOT HOT HOT! At the end.. this was exactly how I felt.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is a great book and series so far. Can't wait to start the next one. Going to purchase it now.
0894803123|5.0|The recipes are right sized for small freezers and come out great!  Leftovers freeze well, too --- assuming there are any!
B003L77FYS|5.0|I've watched this since the beginning. But my daughter started watching in reruns. She got so hooked she wanted to see it from the beginning. I hear h laughing all by herself. Great series.
B00ANDT3P2|5.0|Very edgy story that opens with our heroine rufied and raped at a clique party, a mystery that will eventually be unraveled, but in no way compromises the range of mysteries and surprises of plot that I found addictive. In one episode, I paused at the climax to speculate how Veronica will work out the complications she's caught up in.  The moment and the subsequent play-out of the story gave me a real respect for the writers working on the story and for Rob Thomas' oversight.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This HO game was just awesome! The storyline was creepy and intriguing. It kept me so riveted I couldn't put the game down. The hint button was very helpful when I couldn't decide what to do. I thought the game was a decent length but I was still sad when it ended. Definitely recommended.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|We love this movie in Blu-ray.  Like all our James Bond movies I find it exciting and a wonderful ride.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When I first saw this game being played I wanted to play it for like ever so I found a game kinda like this and I hated it when I saw this was able I was so excited
1552091090|5.0|Bought this for my wife for her first Mother's Day.  She has always loved this book, and it was the perfect present.  If you've got a crier in your family, this is a no brainer.

B001JNNDE2|5.0|I love this movie and enjoy having it in Blu-ray.  It was a great price and very much worth it!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Great game, but we need updates, like the shop, that became year ago to iOS. Halfbrick, do you remember us? Disappointed.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|enjoying game until it reset after months of playing after update!!  extremely upset...we shall see if I get any response back....ill change my review if they do
B00CW665VI|5.0|First of all, this is a wonderful, delightful read. It had me literally smiling and laughing out loud. The writing is witty, clever, engaging and just plain good.  It really reminds me of one of my favs Alice Clayton (The Unidentified Redhead Series and Wallbanger), as she is also a master of the romantic comedy. All the characters are beautifully written and are interesting in there own right, even cute little McKenzie. This author will now definitely be on my radar, as I look forward to her future work.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Only that I can say is: Great game! I love pixel-games, and love when indie developers create innovated gamea like that. Congratulations developers!
B0031TZAHU|5.0|Very well-written story, well designed with twists and turns that unfold to reveal a surprise ending.  Kept me guessing all along and I found myself very involved in the main character.  I found myself wanting to know what happened to her after this story ended and would love a sequel to continue my involvement.

At best, it was a 'Happy For Now' and as a series finale that 'bites'.  I WILL NOT be reading the forthcoming Coda.  Charlaine will not gain another penny from me.  I was disappointed with everything.<br /><br />EPIC FAIL for this reader.  Only a precious few good moments salvaged and extra star for me.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|My motorcycle came equipped with the iThing connector built into the on-board stereo system. I wanted to be able to play my mp3 player thru the system. To do this, I knew I would have to make some trade-offs. I connected the cable to the Apple connector and to my mp3 player. The cable brought the music to the speakers and sounded great. The trade-offs are that I can't control the mp3 player thru the handlebar controls and the song info doesn't appear on the stereo's LCD display. These are both things I can live without. I like the product and it performed as well as, or better, than I expected.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Spielberg works his magic again with stunning cinematography and adapting a great story into film. The story is brilliant in using a horse—and its various owners through whose hands it passes—to guide your eyes through various viewpoints in WWI, from English, to French occupied to advancing German forces. It isn't a movie just about a horse; to view it at such would be a superficial viewing of the movie; it's really about people and relationships, and their connection to a horse that helps us view humanity during a conflicted time in European history. Actor Jeremy Irvine is brilliant as Albert Narracott, the boy who raises and trains the horse &#34;Joey.&#34; For his first film, Irvine brings an incredible amount of heart and emotion to the film, and you'd think he'd been acting for decades already.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. Never gets boring as there are lot's of missions to complete. The graphic's are ok and the characters are exactly as they are in the film's. I play Jurassic Park Builder on my Kindle Fire HD and I don't have any problems. The new Ice age park is amazing. Absolutely hooked!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|The best movie. I have seen this year!<br />The price was less then in a store and this movie is a must have.
B008518MOW|5.0|I have enjoyed each of the movies so far -- great entertainment and as always, there is a twist to the story!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Awesome and informative documentary.  Viewer gets to see the march to Bagdad was not the walk in the park the media made it out to be. The first American casualty suffered in any shooting war, is always the loss of inocense of our warriors.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever.  Where are the Isaac Hayes' of the future? We need more soul in our lives.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has been one of my favorite authors for many years and once I start one of his books it is very difficult to put it down.  The Clifton Chronicles continues and once again I rushed from one chapter to the next to see what was happening within and out of the family.  The author seems to pull one in to see each character as if they were your friend and you want to know more about them as they grow.  Thinking back to other Archer's books, I found myself also drawn into the characters as well.  I am surprised that some of Archer's books have not been made into  films and/or TV series.  They would certainly would gain a large audience much like &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; presently does on PBS.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|It wont let me look at any of my subscriptions. It will only show a few streams when I'm looking for certain ones. Why would you remove the search? That was the worst decision anyone could make. Make it better so I can actually watch my videos.
B00C061I3K|1.0|The success of Daft Punk is a mystery to me.  The music is derivative, corny and not anything like electronic/dance/disco really was.  It's as if someone who was born after that musical period tried to revive the genre and failed utterly.  It's absolute nonsense, and it you really like music like this, go back to the originals and listen to them.  This is the musical equivalent of bland cream of wheat.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart has such a unique voice and gives a different feels to the old classic Christmas songs -- great addition to anyones holiday music collection.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very original and well written. I won't go into the story too much but this post apocalyptic tale of human strength and endurance is so well done it got me hook, line and everything else. A superb read  for everyone, you don't need to be a sci-fi nut, the book is so much more than that. Enjoy.
B000256TD0|4.0|When i got the item in the mail, one of the side view mirrors had broken off.  Possibly from the mail, but...
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I looked forward to seeing this movie since I really liked the stage version (and singers).  The producers of this movie seem to have forgotten that THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FIRST AND FOREMOST A MUSICAL. The quality of the singing is critical.  It should have been done by trained singers.  Russell Crowe was especially bad as Javert.  He simply could not convey any emotion with his weak voice.  The scene with the innkeepers should have been funny.  It was pathetic.  The battle scene on the barricades had no power.  If you like the stage version, don't waste your money on this film version. This might have been a good movie if the actors had stuck with acting instead of singing.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|JJ Abrams reboot of Star Trek in 2009 breathed new life into a franchise which CBS had given up on and which Paramount seemed non-committal to in it's present form. The result was a film which seemed to please current fans, but which brought in a new fan base (younger movie goers and overseas audiences), making \\"Star Trek\\" the highest grossing movie in franchise history.<br /><br />That bit of magic gave Paramount the balls to try a sequel with the new cast and gave Abrams some bit of clout - resulting in an IMAX presentation of the film as well as 3D.<br /><br />Because of the reboots appeal with new audiences - particularly overseas (where Star Trek has historically performed very poorly), the studio wanted to insure a wide appeal to justify the largest budget ever for a Star Trek film.  Focus groups were shown cut after cut of the film to give every beat of the movie the maximum appeal to audiences.<br /><br />The result is a Star Trek which is unparalleled in terms of being a very deliberately engineered product. The movie is clearly designed as a big budget event movie, more than it is a \\"Star Trek\\" movie. Removed or thickly veiled are many of the elements of previous Star Trek incarnations: literary references, idealistic ideologies and existential themes. Instead, it tries to satisfy fans with Star Trek references that might not be easily identified by \\"newbies.\\" For instance, they reference Section 31 - a plot element from the Deep Space 9 series and as far as I know, doesn't appear in any of the other series. They introduce the character Carol Marcus - which is significant if you've seen The Wrath of Khan a million times and recognize her as the mother of Captain Kirk's son David. There is also a quick discussion about the Prime Directive and then that's pretty much the end of Star Trek culture outside of costuming.<br /><br />So, given that the movie is a product, more than any other Star Trek to date, the questions become: Is the movie any good? and Is this a good Star Trek movie? I have to say yes on both counts.<br /><br />This movie breaks the warp barrier in terms of action. 2009's Star Trek had more action than any Star Trek to date. This one starts at a run (literally) and the viewer has to work to catch up the whole show. Some in my family felt like the movie was moving so fast it was hard to catch all of what was going on. I didn't feel like that myself, but I can see their point.<br /><br />The Trek archetypal characterizations are really well performed by the cast and I really enjoyed the interaction between the characters. Additionally, the screenwriters have done a good job constructing dialog which feels true to each character.  There's plenty of humor here, but maybe not as much as the last film - there's just no room/time for joking around.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a terrorist attack which spurs Starfleet brass to mount an assassination attempt. Kirk fights with his feelings for revenge and as the plot unfolds, interesting conspiracies arise.<br /><br />The emotional component of the film is another strength of the film. Characters are given emotional motivations and the stakes are high - both for earth and Starfleet, but also for the Enterprise crew. All the cast get a nice emotional beat in the film, though Chekov probably gets slighted a little bit.<br /><br />There are obvious references to the best of all previous Star Trek films which are handled expertly - familiar but wholly new. I loved the obvious tribute to the previous films as well as the new perspective from the eyes of this parallel universe crew.<br /><br />The thing I have always loved about Star Trek, in all it's incarnations, is the bond between the crew. That bond of friendship is at the heart of Star Trek Into Darkness and is the movies greatest success.is a good Star Trek movie?

B005H0IW6W|5.0|great voice and great addition to my holiday music collection -- truely classic but new. If you like his other music you will love this one.
0307913147|5.0|Geek out Alert!!!  A total must read for all gamers, music lovers, 80's pop culture fanatics and anime/comicon geeks!  What a love letter to all things 80's and I was in school during the whole Reagan/Rubix Cube era. I laughed at loud to the funny movie references and the name of the dance software. I have read the book and have am now I my second listen to the audio book. Read excellently by Wil Wheaton! Listen and have fun!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|If you want to feel good, if you want to feel inspired, if you want a reason to hang in there, then this is the film you have to see.  What an incredible story.  You need two things for this award winning documentary, cleenex and your credit card.  The credit card for when it ends and you have to buy his albums.  Simply life changing.
B00A1XIXM8|4.0|a solid bad religion album. good guitars, and pretty good vocals. not as good as some of their past material, but not their worst, either. would still recommend it for an extra bad religion fix.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|A classic series on a timeless theme, with an outstanding cast, how can you go wrong?  This is my third time through the series and I am still finding nuances I missed before.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT...I DO PREFER THE FIRST ONE BUT THIS ONE IS GREAT TOO..A GREAT FOLLOW UP TO MIB2....A FUN LOVING MOVIE FOR MOST..WOLFIE
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Good game, and it allows you to play the with FB friends. The `lives` refill quickly, which is a real plus. The biggest drawback is tech support. I lost all my gold and diamonds, and contacting tech support was useless. They simply said it wasn't their problem, and it was too difficult to try to keep android devices working. I found it annoying that tech support didn't really bother to even read the email that I sent outlining the problems I was having. SO.......the game is good, tech support is horrible.
0545419662|5.0|We love the Pete the Cat series of books! My 5 yr old really enjoys reading these books to us and his friends! Great beginner books that build confidence in new readers!
B00CW665VI|4.0|This book is absolutely fantastic.  Reading through the eyes of a man was just awesome.  It was fun to read the way Drew viewed things and the advice he throws at the reader is just insanely on point.  It was also refreshing to see how a man falls hard for a woman, and view it from his vantage point.  This is definitely one of those books that you can't miss.  It is so worth reading.  Congrats to Emma Chase on this.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I LIKED READING MOST OF THE INTERVIEWS IN THE BOOK BUT SOME WERE REALLY DRY. ULTIMATELY IT'S WORTH THE READ.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Everything I love about the movie brought to sensory overload.  It is more than fantastic on 75 inches of 1080i with DTS 7.1 sound.  Plus the extras are equally improved and more have been added. No wonder I don't go to the theater and suffer through 20 minutes+ of commercials to see a movie any more.
B007Y36K46|5.0|Sorry I didn't see it on the big screen, I thought it was very enjoyable.Special effects are good, characters fully developed. It doesn't follow the book directly, but it's close enough to get a feel.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Art, music,movie theme, humanity, computer technology, film, special<br />effects,photography and...yes HAL,the 9000 series computer invented in<br />Urbana, Ill in 1992 even had an effect on my thought processes. [The<br />9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer<br />has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any<br />practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.]<br />No other movie impressed me as much as \\"2001 A Space Odessey\\"<br /><br />Since then, I have read 2010, 2060 by Arthur C Clark with much<br />enjoyment and intellectual gratitude. Also, back 42 years ago, I read<br />an amazing story by Arthur C Clark entitled \\"CHILDHOOD'S END\\" which I<br />found intellectually stimulating in thought. This month, I downloaded<br />this book onto my Kindle to revisit that strange thesis.<br />With 42 additional years of life under my belt, and having<br />participated in and observed 42 years of World history-the Good, the<br />BAD and the Ugly- I have grasped a better understanding of what<br />Clark's was saying in that book. The Overlords should be on their way!
B000ICXQXS|5.0|'The Sting' involves a complicated plot by two professional cons (Newman and Redford) to get mob boss Robert Shaw after the latter murders Redford's partner (Luther Coleman) in retaliation for losing $11,000. Redford then asks Newman for help taking on Shaw for revenge.<br /><br />Newman comes up with an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as 'the wire,' using a large number of con artists to create a fake off-track betting parlor. It starts with Newman out-cheating Shaw to win $15,000. Redford then poses as Newman's disgruntled employee and is sent to collect Newman's winnings, and instead convinces Shaw that he wants help breaking Newman so he (Redford) can take over.<br /><br />At this point, the action is only getting started, and continues at an amazing and credible pace.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|A fascinating person with very deep thoughts. I've seen the movie &#34;Gia&#34; on tv at least 3 times and I &#34;pick up&#34; on a new meaning to something each time I watch it.
B009K6DKTS|1.0|The books starts off with a valid point then pushes it to the extreme.  His dislike, or is that bitterness, towards others who have a different view distorts his message and eventually becomes tedious.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|The is the next best CPU available for personal computing and graphics generation.  It is a little more economical than the 8150, but still provides the power of 8 cores and is unlocked so it can be overclocked above the standard 8150 specs, if need be, which is unlikely because the standard performance is more than most can use.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I play on an average of once daily.  Playing Jewels Star makes the time pass faster when waiting for appointments.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A little slower than book one to start, but really good once you get into it. On to book three.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Wow, I can hardly wait for next season. I believe it starts in June on Showtime. This season was full of surprises.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This movie feels a little tedious even with the special effects but I need to qualify that by saying it lays down the history and characters involved leading up to the trilogy and with a little patience on the viewer's part, it does accomplish this. I am a Hobbit fan and have read and re-read the entire collection several times and admit The Hobbit (book) is a little &#34;dry&#34; at times also.<br />Someone who has no prior experience with Middle Earth, it's inhabitants, and the events that brought them together might find this movie wanting as far as the plot and no doubt will feel they are left &#34;hanging&#34; at the end which of course is why the sequel will be released. I am anticipating the next movie- The Desolation of Smaug- and will buy it when the time comes believing the two films will come together like &#34;hand and glove&#34; just like the books do.
B006QNDDHW|5.0|Simple to understand, great information.  Easy to read and apply.  Even non-designers can get these concepts and make rock star presentations.  WORTH EVERY DIME and even more.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I didn't actually watch the series, but it kept my wife entertained while I was working, so it has my vote.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I just hot out off school and I was bored so I got this game and I love ut and I know that me and my friends are going to play this all the time

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|My wife and I saw Into Darkness and loved it and she is not a big sci-fi/ST fan.<br /><br />This movie has it all:  Great story with great acting; action, drama, suspense, comedy and<br />an awesome soundtrack.  There are moments that make you laugh and then those that will bring a tear to your eye.<br /><br />If you are a long time ST fan like me going back to TOS, you'll appreciate many of the little things laced throughout this film.  If you are a newbie to the ST universe you'll still love this movie.<br /><br />I'll be going to a second theater viewing then waiting impatiently for the DVD.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|Muse is my favorite band so I'm a bit biased, but I love this album. It's not quite Origin of Symmetry or Absolution, but it's great and has a lot of high points. I'm especially fond of MK Ultra but I do think there are better songs on the album.

B004NELBPC|4.0|I expected this paper to lead the pack in the novel outlook. I find it to have some novel aspects but nothing extreme and certainly little depth. I'm surprised at the brief and casual discussion of issues. The title and first paragraph often convey most of the articles content. Hopefully as I get to know the Huffington Post more fully I'll discover more of its liberal agenda. Or perhaps when my friend Amy says &#34;Jonathon, you're so liberal.&#34; she's on to something that speaks to my not finding Huffington Post very liberal.  Jon
B001YV504U|5.0|As baseball season started back up, I decided that it was time to watch the classic movies about my favorite sport.  Imagine my surprise when I realized that despite our large (800+) movie collection, we didn't own Field of Dreams.  Needless to say, I jumped right on Amazon.  This movie is the perfect tale of perseverance, family, and friends.  It also represents a sport that has been dubbed &#34;America's Pastime&#34;.<br /><br />This classic also contains what is perhaps one of the greatest speeches in movie history, &#34;People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway not knowing for sure why they're doing it. They'll arrive at your door as innocent as children, longing for the past. &#34;Of course, we won't mind if you look around&#34;, you'll say, &#34;It's only $20 per person&#34;. They'll pass over the money without even thinking about it: for it is money they have and peace they lack. And they'll walk out to the bleachers; sit in shirtsleeves on a perfect afternoon. They'll find they have reserved seats somewhere along one of the baselines, where they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes. And they'll watch the game and it'll be as if they dipped themselves in magic waters. The memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces. People will come Ray. The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game: it's a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was good and that could be again. Oh...people will come Ray. People will most definitely come.” ~James Earl Jones/ Field of Dreams<br /><br />It arrived on the date it was scheduled too in perfect condition and played with no problems.  I'm not sure it was necessary to get it on blu-ray, but at the time, it was cheaperon blu-ray than regular DVD.  So order your copy, sit back, and enjoy the game.  PLAY BALL!
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|I love the main theme continued from the 2009 film with bits of Alexander Courage's original theme.<br /><br />There are some really great tracks on this album and the music really added to the film experience.<br /><br />One of my favorites is \\"London Calling\\" with the piano at the start.  \\"Buying The Space Farm\\" also brings out the emotion.<br /><br />My first ST movie soundtrack purchase was \\"The Wrath of Khan\\".  How weird is that?<br /><br />This would make a great addition to your ST movie soundtrack collection.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm not sure what all the uproar is about honestly. True, the quality of this story was not up to par with most of the others and definitely lacking the action and passion. But the ending that has everyone \\"livid\\" about was totally expected in my opinion. I mean really, the subtle hints along the way were soooo predictable. I would have been shocked if she had ended it any other way.<br />And those that complained that Sookie could have so much more with her new found knowledge of the supernatural, is the opposite of what Sookie is all about. She has always longed for \\"normalcy\\" and the fact that she doesn't eagerly enter the \\"abnormal\\" world is again, expected.<br />So while I agree that this last story didn't really go out with a bang as most wanted and expected, it certainly isn't as horrid as many make it out to be.<br />All in all, the series provided me with enjoyable entertainment over the years and I thank the author for that.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I thought this was going to br a total chic flick but I was wrong and really enjoyed it. Its pretty funny and at the same time its a great acting job by the lead characters. You'll like it and yes I teared up a.bit at the ending. So enjoy and score a few brownie points with the ladies.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|Saw this in theatres and was happy to find they did a WAY better job making this book into a movie then the twilight nightmare.

B0025KVLS8|4.0|When they were promoting these remasters they claimed that the sound was so good that it felt like you're in the studio when they recorded the album I beg to differ.  If I had a fresh vinyl copy of this album playing on a good stereo it would have had a better sound. I think that by trying to be as close as to the original as possible they sacrificed what could have been a great sounding CD. Think about with all the great audio technology that's out there you think this is the best they can do?  I say they should have giving the fans a choice. Let it stick to the original in mono and offer a true up to date stereo mix CD that doesn't give you have the music in one speaker and have the music and vocals in the other.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I bought this for my husband for vacation kindle read and he just wasn't thrilled.  It was the review from others that prompted my purchase so maybe my comment will balance the scales.  He did finish it to the end so I would not feel guilty about the money.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|Whatever happened to just listening and enjoying the music?  Some of the people who write reviews must think they are writing for the New York Times - they write these lengthy reviews and tear every song apart.  You might just sit down, relax and listen!  Either you like Michael Buble or you don't.  I happen to love him, his sound, and his laid back manner.  I love to listen to his music - it doesn't have all the 4-letter words every other word.  In my opinion, his music and songs are soothing and not grating on my nerves.  When I am driving, working or relaxing, I want to hear positive music that makes me feel good and not 4-letter words and angry, negative songs.  But like the saying goes, everyone has an opinion!  This CD is wonderful and every song is beautifully done in Michael Buble's own style!!!!!!
0756407125|4.0|Well, this book fell into the sequel trap that most books do - it is good and interesting, but you can also tell that the author is holding back the really good stuff for the final book - most trilogies do this - and the books tend to either either go great-decent-wonderful or great-decent-what the frig? - this one I hope will be the former and not the latter - don't get me wrong - this is an enjoyable enough read, but I felt that some of the fire and drive from The Name of the Wind was missing - as far as the King Killer meta-stories go, this one was hit or miss for me, and since I will not present spoilers, let's just say that one of the sub-plots to me was frivolous and boring, and I glazed over it without true interest - though, another of the sub-plots was interesting and didn't end the way that I had guessed, which is also good, as predictable is not always a good thing - and then one of the sub-plots was so spread out, that you wanted it resolved, and Kvothe went and did something else - he had several stories and events happen in between the one that I wanted resolved, and of course that didn't end predictable either - Patrick Rothfuss is good at that part - he gives you everything that you know and love in the storyline, except the endings are all skewed - not bad or failed, but the happy endings never end the way that you think, and I enjoy that immensely - I will definitely be one of the many anticipating book three of the series.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I must say Ive liked STAR TREK most of life . Though when they started to make the movies , one thing changed , 'peoples do age \\" .As when they got to the 6th movie , I was glad they threw the towel in , but money kept Shatner going , an then STTNG movies came along , only FIRST CONTACT was any good, but with these Actors saleries, the budget in theses films  were small . Then came the re-boot , I was a nayser. I didnt think it would work , till I saw the last film . INTO DARKNESS , is awesome , I saw it in IMAX 3D , an must say I was blown away ! Wow ,now i want to get a 3D Dvd player (LOL). This film effects , casting CGI are well done . Though I could never think  a starship can go underwater on a planet made me sratch my head , but its a movie ! In movies they are plotholes (LOL) You still gotta love it . And yes cant wait for the Bluray .

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|so many times during this movie i said &#34;that jack reacher is too damn smart&#34; and mostly it was the small details that really blew my mind. i was constantly turning to my wife saying &#34;did you see that!?&#34; im pretty sure she was annoyed and she doesnt even like watching action movies.... but even she got pulled into this movie and ended up saying it was pretty good. i cant believe i never heard about this movie until it came out on dvd. definitely recommend this movie.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I remember reading some articles about Jaycee as well as seeing her mentioned on TV, so when I saw that she put out a book, I knew I needed to read it. The book is absolutely a great read. It's powerful and sometimes difficult to read because of what happened, but as she says, she's not a victim; she survived, and I think it is incredibly brave of her to put all of her story out there for others to know.

1619695006|3.0|This book has many characters.  Maybe too many.  It's full of people that are either horrible or pathetic.  Part of the reason I continued with the book is because of Tom Hollander's reading performance.  Other than that none of the people in the plot have any reason to care about them.  Or the story, which wasn't much.  It ends in a not at all surprising way.
B001AITGWE|4.0|great movie. i saw this movie when i was quite a bit younger and i remembered it being a great movie... and after watching it again... its still a great movie. classic 90s movie.

B00BLGXL3U|3.0|This movie was interesting and the acting was great and believable but it was not clear who or what it was about. It almost seemed like scenes of Joaqin's character's life with the master. Did not explain the master's story or what he was preaching about. The ending was not satisfying and it required me to research the movie to understand what it was supposed to be about.

0688014291|2.0|The manager who manages best manages the least. That's the big takeaway from this book.<br /><br />It's mostly true and there's some basic elemental truth in this title. People are people, and regardless of the time period or work environment, they still operate in the same ways and respond to the same incentives.<br /><br />However, the writing is absolutely wretched. I couldn't wait to finish reading the book and plowed through the last few chapters by sheer force of will. On the positive side, the book is mercifully short.<br /><br />I'll sum it up right here: Give your employees clear goals. Let them know early what success looks like and how they can achieve it. Give immediate feedback and focus on the positive. Actually care about their growth and well being. If an employee has a problem, tell them immediately, and make sure you make it about their actions, not about them personally.<br /><br />People want to know you respect them as a person and they do best when they know what's expected. Many managers don't let people know if they're doing a good job or a bad job until it's too late to fix it, and too many focus on the \\"no news is good news\\" style of management.<br /><br />If you didn't know these things already, maybe you should read the book -- it'll explain why all that works. Otherwise, skip it. It's a short but painful read.
0061339202|5.0|This book is awesome. It looks at how people can get themselves into `the zone,' the flow state. It is the culmination of years of research by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (Yes that is the author's name). It is not easy going but very rewarding.
1451696191|4.0|I did not like the style at all--I found it distracting.  But the story is good.  Contrary to most book to screenplay efforts, I found that the movie conveyed the feel of the characters much better than the printed version.  None-the-less, it is still a worthwhile read.

Made me feel like a kid again because it took me on a roller-coaster adventure ride.<br /><br />Robin Sloan is a great wordsmith and storyteller.  He created an unforgettable \\"new world sleuthing fantasy\\", which combines so many of my favorites:<br />Book stores, great imagination, modern technology vs- Luddite mentality, page turning adventure, and characters I care about and whom, if they were non-fiction, I would love to meet!!!!!<br />As I've told many of my friends:  I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Judy Marcus, Memory Lady

081297381X|4.0|The title of this book is now being used as a euphemism for all that is unpredictable. `You can't predict the Black Swan!' With an astonishing grasp of mathematics, philosophy, economics and human behaviour Taleb shows why there are no economists in the richest 500 people. It is a little dense on occasions and he could do with a good editor ... but then editing ideas and flow of thought is against everything Taleb stands for.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|When I heard that the movie of The Hobbit had been made into three parts, I was totally dumbfounded as to why given that [[ASIN:0544003411 The Lord of the Rings]] was made up of three books, all of which were longer thank the book of The Hobbit.<br />But I have seen now the skill in which The Hobbit was fleshed out and parts taken from The Lord of the Rings,  [[ASIN:0618126988 The Silmarillion]] and [[ASIN:0618154051 Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth]]. The book The Hobbit itself , lighter in tone than the Lord of the Rings, nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface, such as Gondolin, the last White Council, the Necromancer, and the ring.The movie actually brings some of these references into the story much more fully, especially the Last White Council, and brings in the great friend of the trees and animals, Radagast the Brown (played by Sylvester McCoy).<br />This movie was certainly as good as The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is the story of the adventure of Bilbo Baggins , a Hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the Shire, recruited by the wizard Gandalf (once again Ian McKellen excels in the role) and a company of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield (played with majesty and gravitas), to wrest the Dwarves lost homeland of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug under the Lonely Mountain. The company must first battle Trolls , Goblins , Wargs , and comes into contact with Elves , Eagles , Men and other inhabitants of Tolkien's wonderful world.<br /><br />Each of the Dwarves has its own character and is played with skill and entertainingly so. Great recreation of Rivendell , the reappearance of Hugo Weaving as Elrond and Kate Blanchett as Galadriel. The full grotesque loathsomeness of Orc chieftains such as the revolting Great Goblin (Barry Humphries) and the sheer evil of the Orc king Azog (Manu Bennett). Highlights include Bilbo's encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and the great concluding scene with The Eagles. A must see visual feast, and does the magic of Tolkien justice.A must see visual feast, and does the magic of Tolkien justice.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I heard of \\"Food, Inc.\\" five years ago when Michael Pollan was on Oprah.  I started eating more organic just from the information shown on the program.  Now, five years later, I have now recently transitioned my diet to a vegan diet.  I've been eating a whole-food plant-based diet for the last 3 months and feel so much healthier. I have chosen to eat this way primarily for health reasons, but also out of fear of GMO's.  Knowing that our farm animals are fed a diet rich of GMO corn and we are what we eat, I have become concerned of what eating animals fed a GMO diet will have on our health.<br /><br /> As I was browsing the health documentaries on Amazon, I stumbled across this DVD.  I remembered seeing it on Oprah and wondered why I had never bought it.  I think a few negative reviews had turned me away.  I'm glad I finally made the decision to purchase it and watch it.  The film reinforced my belief about food.  Food should be natural, real, the way our grandparents and ancestors ate.  Without chemicals, and genetic modifications.  This film gave me another reason to eat an organic plant-based diet, your risk of getting E-coli is greatly decreased.  The movie really made me think.  Most of us take for granted how important food is to us.  We all know we need it for life, but most of us never think about what we are actually eating and how eating something can effect our health for years to come.  Or even cause death in a few days.  I don't want to feed my kids burgers unless it's one I made at home using grass-fed meat. I'm not paranoid, just aware and cautious and this film gave me reason to be.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoyed it.  I'm going to share it with my friends and family.  It was well-made and very informative.  It was entertaining.  I think it's important for everyone to know what America's food industry is really doing.  I was very happy to see them make many mentions of Monsanto, a company I already didn't trust.  You do have a choice.  You choose what you eat 3 times a day. Buy Local. Buy Organic. It's that simple.t you eat 3 times a day. Buy Local. Buy Organic. It's that simple.

1400032717|5.0|Started and couldn't put this book down.  Life events as perceived and described by an autistic boy, exposing the nonsensical, the brutally factual, the pure data-based reasoning in one's mind.  I was never quite sure where we were going, but we were on our way.  Until we suddenly weren't. Quirky, funny, direct and terse ... very nice!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Beautiful graphics make it easy to get hooked on this one! However, when we tried to purchase the in-app for extra 'pearls', the order went through, account was charged, but the pearls never showed up on the screen. Amazon was nice enough to refund the charge, but cautioned the in-app would never be available again. Since it takes forever to build up 'pearls' for the real fun stuff without buying them, this has taken some of the joy out of the app. Hard not to give this beauty the full five stars, but that problem still rankles.

Sure there are jerks, but for the most part, people are kind, helpful and encouraging.  The premise of the book and was a bit \\"stretched\\" for me, and some of it is a tad too melodramatic for me, but the positive message and ***spoiler alert*** happy ending to the story make it all OK.

B00CE004XM|5.0|I figured after the friendly banter with Baberufus, I'd better give a review.  Actually there is not much more to say as others have hit the nail on the head.  I simply want to add that this album has been played 6 times in the three days that I've owned it.  I love \\"Joe's\\" love making review... yup.  \\"Bax\\" says it well, stunning and then my favorite is Jeanie who says HOLY CANNOLI my speakers are on fire.  AMEN Sister, AMEN, mine are too.<br /><br />This is a smokin' disc full of powerful performances, great players and yes, even some scorching Joe B guitar solos.  DO NOT miss the one on \\"I love you more than You'll ever know\\".  Beth is well, in a zone and kills the vocals.  WOW!  On Nutbush, I said out loud, Tina who?<br /><br />I guess, it should be said, so others who are of the \\"Baberufus\\" mind will not be disappointed, this is not a guitar/blues disc.  So, don't be looking for tunes that are on his solo discs.  That said, to my ears at least, this is even better.  It has it all and will indeed be in my rotation for a long long time.  It is truly a 5 star effort for me.
0061743526|2.0|I've read this book three times, the first while in high school, and the last, recently.  Each time, my experience has been the same:  a weak story that is over-played with heavy-handed melodrama. Shallow characters that the author tries to make stronger via the drama.  There are scores of American books that I would recommend before this \\"classic\\", although it has devleped quite a band-wagon full of followers over the years. I'm not one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm loving the suspense of it. Who's friend? Who's foe? There was continuity. I don't see much of that in book sequels.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this game after playing a demo of flower and I was intrigued as to how these people made a game where you play as a flower petal fun. I had know idea what Flow or Journey was going to be like. I didn't know what I was in for. Flow is a fun little game that reminds me of an iPhone app (which makes sense because it was initially made as a flash game). I was really shocked at how much I enjoyed Flower. It's more of a meditative, video game version of a poem that breaks away from conventional video games. Journey, however, is something else entirely. I simply wasn't expecting the emotional impact this game gave me. I feel everyone, including non-gamers, should play this. I haven't enjoyed a truly unique experience like this since the days of the Nintendo 64 and playing Mario 64 and Zelda: Ocarina of Time. This is a must-have for any game enthusiast.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Exciting, believable, makes you just want more and more. Bring on the next one! I hope I don't have to wait long!  Good, entertaining reading.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|The match-3 mechanic is easy and not unfamiliar to people who have played other puzzle games. The rows or colums are dragged, rather than a swap-match like Bejeweled.  But the quick pace of the game is like playing Bejeweled in action mode. Plus the meta-game of the dungeon gives your matching a purpose making it more interesting.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. Extremely well written in terms of the actual text, but also an awesome story.

B0025VLELQ|5.0|The Blue-ray edition is excellent.  Like the original 'Tron', it makes you realize how far CGI has come.  Robert Preston stole the show!
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first the story started out kind of slow, but the twists that start happening really keep you reading to find out what's next. The story baffles the mind and further proves just how far people go.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|Here I thought we could have beginnings of a new fantasy trilogy, but no. Consider this: a young boy of age 14 wants to be a knight, but is rejected. Then it turns out that he might be a wizard (or druid or what-have-you) - in all you standard stock fantasy. Boy runs away to the capital, becomes a squire and befriends the royal family. In a span of one day.<br />Then it appears that a 14-year old can walk from capital to the border in one evening -- and do a night of monster-slaying and return next morning. This happens on day #2, by the way. Then we have feasts and romance and scheme-hatching and all your basic fantasy elements.<br />This is all well and good, but when you fill 4 days with a years worth of happenings, it's a bit comical -- but above all you miss out on an important theme on fantasy -- growth and experience. That's also known as character development, by the way.
1616615362|5.0|This ship is amazing. It has tons of shield and hull points and can put out a lot of damage. The pilots for this ship have good abilities, and Kath Scarlet may be one of the most amazing pilots in the game. This also comes with a lot of ship upgrade cards, including the always useful &#34;Stealth Device&#34;.
0553582038|4.0|The delivery went smoothly.  The book was in great condition.  I haven't read it yet, but it has to be at least as good as the first 3!!
B00005K9LK|5.0|I love this album, I can't decide if it's my favorite Judas Priest album but it definitely ranks up there in the top 3. If you like Judas Priest, this album has what you need musically. Get it, no questions asked.<br /><br />Great shipping speed, product in great quality, prices reasonable.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love that it keeps my headset safe in my purse and charged.  I recently took a 12 day business trip and never had to charge either!  But it was nice to not have to carry my charger, just a multipurpose USB to charge the case that I can use to synch my phone and other things as well.  Great, great item.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very good book recommend anybody interested in her story to read her authentic stories of her captivity and her release from her captivity.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|A must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Will certainly become a &#34;classic&#34;.<br />Expertly written and acted with suttle undertones that keep you guessing about the possible outcome in each series.
B001AUKUTU|5.0|Great album. I love Dio! If you like metal in anyway, you MUST own this album. It's incredible! My only qualm was that the album cover looks grainy. So I dont know if this is a cheap knock of printing or if the album cover actually looks grainy. Eitehr was, can't complain considering the very low price of the album and I highly recommend buying it.<br /><br />Shipping speed was great, price was very cheap, quality of product was perfect.
0525423656|5.0|He was thrilled that I agreed to add these to his library.  Applies to tween and teen minds, alternate society and light romance all in one.  Makes them think about the choices they have in this world and that love will always be important no matter what kind of society evolves...  we have read them together... and I enjoy them too.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|These books are so well written its hard to watch the series after you have read the books. George Martin does a great job with character development throughout the series with his characters gaining a rich depth as the story gains strengthens .

B004A8ZWVK|3.0|Only 3/4 of the CDs arrived for this audio tape. What I listened to was great. The book is great. Lots of stuff in book not in movie.  Hasted to turn it off but then I ran out of  CDs.  Seller shorted me on the order. Book good though.  Too bad  because I paid a premium price for it.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|Nice introduction to a less superficial book. It does what it says but needs more substance. Ok for a free download. Reads in half an hour also.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|Well, I am glad I waited for a audio version of this title since the DVD previously released contained half of what this title has on it. I mean, the DVD's usually have more tracks then the CD's or are both complete, not the other way around. So, here we have a very good set of \\"Live\\" performances covering their career. So if your a classic rock lover of \\"Live\\" music, check it out. Sample the tracks, this is worthy of any one who is a fan or a collector of their music like myself.<br />Drop by my Website / BLOG site & look around @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\", there is something for about everyone on it.
1616550414|5.0|If you love Zelda or even love video games, this is the item to get. I love Zelda and this is a perfect addition to my Zelda collection.

B00AZMFJYA|1.0|Its one thing to use a nifty device (timeline change) to avoid troubling questions of continuity inherent in recreating a franchise with millions of fanatical followers who would go nuts about every error.  Its quite another to be too lazy to do the research to avoid conflicts with things that inexplicably become changed BEFORE the timeline change occurred.  Listing the large numbers of those will be left to true Trek fans.<br /><br />As a movie, the modern elements are there;  big special effects and car chases.  As STAR TREK, only the most superficial elements are there;  phasers and transporters.  Despite a superb cast, especially the villain, what's missing is what makes Star Trek STAR TREK!  That thing is Story!  The big ORIGINAL idea!<br /><br />Ok, there's some nostalgia in bringing back a true Trek villain, a similar but different incarnation.  But it was done better the first time.  And when you wait years for a feature film you expect a higher standard to be met.  It was story, concept, cognitive stimulation that made STAR TREK the most successful television franchise ever, that inspired generations of scientists, that brought us back by the millions wanting more.  None of that is in this movie!  If it can be done in a weekly TV series certainly it can be done in a big-budget feature film.  They didn't even try.  I wanted \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" and they brought me \\"Fast and Furious 87\\".<br /><br />Anyone could enjoy this movie.  But who was emotionally moved by this movie?  Who was inspired to change their future?  Who was introduced to a concept that made them THINK??  And lacking those elements is where creating new Trek becomes exploiting old Trek, no matter how well that exploitation is done!
159463176X|5.0|This is Khaled Hosseini's masterpiece. The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns were good, maybe 3.5 or 4  stars, but, seriously, this is going to be on my TOP 5 OF ALL TIME for years to come.<br /><br />It starts with a bedtime story from an Afghani father, to his two children, a boy, 10, and a girl, 4. It is, of course, an allegory of their family story, and a story of our family's power to destroy us, disappoint us, or overjoy us, especially with overlove and underlove. As soon as a parent even subconsciously picks a favorite, the other children automatically know, as if by osmosis. Children suffer over these things their whole lives. Holes are made in our hearts this way that have much more poignancy than bullet wounds to the chest.<br /><br />This first story is about basically a monster \\"div\\" who gets a father to give up his favorite child or else the div will take all 5 of them. The story is about the universal expectations we have of ourselves and our family members for how we will love them, treat them and/or mourn them. We, of course, will NEVER give up. The ends of the earth and all that...the sad fact is that we often are left with few resources to make this happen.<br /><br />The book is a novel about feminism in Afghanistan from 1949 to 2010. It is a collection of parallel stories that surround this family - other families who struggled through the war years from 1979 - present. It is the story of tragic mistakes, weaknesses, character flaws that we all have, but here in Afghanistan, it has gone off the rails.<br />There are stories of girls with facial mutilations - the faceless women of Afghanistan: the mothers who are simultaneously the powerless and the backbones of the family, who also have to hope that their husbands have enough good sense for each individual in the family to thrive. He is the one who makes the decisions that count, and, in a patriarchal society, what he chooses will most often favor sons. In a culture where women are coveredin burqas, they hide in plain sight. Only men in their families or their women friends will be able to know them. They are blank slates and we are carried to the handwriting on the wall. Just like everywhere, there are winners and there are losers among these stories. I'm not sure if a single other country has been at war for 30 years straight, but I can tell you, there are many faceless losers along the way.<br /><br />Hosseini tells these stories movingly, compassionately, emotionally. At times it is raw, but it is also gripping, inspiring and devastating. I couldn't put it down, and I haven't been this stuck to a book since The Poisonwood Bible(Barbara Kingsolver).<br />With that mentioned, I will present my personal list of TOP 5 FOR ALL TIME:<br />1) The Poisonwood Bible [[ASIN:B009O2FAOG Poisonwood Bible]]- Barbara Kingsolver<br />2) And The Mountains Echoed<br />3) East of Eden [[ASIN:0142000655 East of Eden]]- John Steinbeck<br />4) The Bridge of San Luis Rey [[ASIN:0060580615 The Bridge of San Luis Rey: A Novel]]- Thornton Wilder<br />5) American Pastoral [[ASIN:0375701427 American Pastoral]]- Philip Roth<br />now, fallen from #5,  6) Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close [[ASIN:B0084PU2J2 Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close]]- Jonathan Safran Foer
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love this series. Can't wait for the next book. I was disappointed because I thought this book would have the ending
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|Compliments to the designers of this game. Unlike other games that overwhelm with tasks with no chance to dig out if you get behind, this game offers similar volume of tasks - but you can overcome and still get ahead with some magement skills :-)
B00006DEFA|5.0|I love the movie Amadeus. The music is soothing and entertaining. I enjoy watching the storyline of the movie and can relate to what is happening. It is a moving and touching movie. I gave it  5 stars cause it is worth it.
B0011ZYIZQ|5.0|I have been a big fan of Anita Baker for some time. This CD is a classic. I like every track. This is a CD you can put in the CD player,and never have to skip a track.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|This Blu-Ray edition is wonderful. Very crisp, and vibrant. I noticed the different right away. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved everything about this book! The characters, the storyline, the 'voice' given to Drew, the strong heroine Kate and the candid writing style. It really was that good people. A nice refreshing read with 'fun' angst...no really. The author sucks you right in....Let her 'cause it's soooooo worth it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love this series!  I've always loved mythology and this just brings it to life. Can't wait for the next installment.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This seems to be a very good product.  The material is soft and seems durable. It holds the Kindle Fire very securly.  I would recommend it.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|I have love Will Smith movie and I Robot is one of my favour but 3d did not work as good as other 3d movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire was not working and would not hold a charge, It was a new gift to me and I could not understand why it would only hold a charge for a hour or 2 at the best..<br />I just kept trying to charge it over and over until it  just locked up and stopped charging all together.<br />Not understanding anything about the Kindle, (Yes, I had read about it but it was still new to me) I finally called and that was the best thing I could have done and I should have called right away. It never dawned on me there could be a problem.<br />The Rep was so helpful and sent me a new cord and plug and it has worked great since.<br />If I have any questions again I will call immediately. The reps are so helpful.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I imagine there are a lot of people for whom this movie will be just another high school drama, but it is so much more than that. Maybe the only thing it has in common with other movies in it's genre is that the characters are idealized and unreasonably mature for their ages.<br /><br />Putting that aside, this movie is a profound celebration of life. Don't miss it.
B002ZG976U|5.0|We first saw it on TV and had to have it for our collection. We also have the music CD.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Enjoyed this movie and the visual was stunning. Good for ages 10 and up. Smaller children may not understand the theme. Small amount of violence in beginning.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE the game and I play it all the time.<br />it is just loved by EVRYONE.so cool and I love I just LOVE<br />it.
B006PRCGKO|4.0|My husband loves science fiction and he enjoys this one a lot.  Who's messing with the crew--and what are there intentions?
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Too drawn out; not nearly as well-written as the first in the series.  Too many sub-plots and too little character development.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Very fun, rewarding match 3 puzzle game. Dungeon rpg twist to a simple puzzle game makes this a winner. Very addicting!
159562015X|4.0|Did not read the book. Bought just for the self-test which was interesting. Fun test. I would recommend to a friend.
0790733226|5.0|Carl Sagan, the greatest science teacher in history writes a story of the epic battle between science and religion synthesizing the two into one. Science is the only way to reveal the true nature of the universe and religion is the manifestation of man's desire to know the ultimate truth without having to think at all. Both will completely fail to ever resolve the question of WHY even if science is able to explain in massive detail exactly HOW everything came to be and how it will end/begin. There is no greater entity to verify that why part. Clearly the tensions revolving around science and religion and the forces that seek to utilize one or the other to seek dominance was an issue when written and indeed remains a very serious problem almost 2 decades later. For whatever reason man seems to have to know the ultimate answers and will make them up when convenient. Despite the concept of the evil scientist, itself a product of fear and ignorance of science and what it reveals, the world has nothing to fear from science...it's not an ideology, just a method of proving things. However religion has been, and I'm afraid will always be, the greatest source of fear, hate, stupidity and violence affecting civilization that can ever be. That's why this movie is so damn good. Doesn't really resolve anything just opens up the dialog with imaginative, intelligent and artistic presentation.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best game ever... Even my mom and grandma love to play this game. Its the best game out there on the market right now
0061714402|4.0|I must say that I read a lot, fiction, non fiction, good novels, classics and I also love music and Megadeth. So when I saw this for less than 3 bucks for my Kindle I didnt hesitate. I was right!<br /><br />Im not going to spoil the book for everybody but let me tell you that this is a FUN read, it took me some 10 hours to finish everything in about 3 sittings. I loved how the whole 80s and first half of the 90s were thoroughly covered. there were some really funny passages (London Hotel Pissing Incident, Jeff Young \\"The Teacher\\",etc), but also some really deep stuff like what Dave learned about marriage in Hawaii (I actually took this one for my own marriage).<br /><br />Im not giving it 5 stars only because Id wish Mustaine and Co had given a bit more depth to the Post Risk era from a music standpoint. Mustaine goes heavily on his demons, which is all cool and makes for a great reading. But I was left thirsty to know more about the production details.<br /><br />Buy it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  It was decent, had a good story line and taught some eternal truths that are important for every family to learn.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|So, the title of my review says it all. And I'll be brief.<br /><br />This film has garnered a lot of controversy over its depiction of the use of torture/water-boarding to find Osama Bin Laden. I know that a lot of critics, especially those on the left, claimed that the movie took a \\"pro-torture\\" stance and also claimed that the movie itself is depicting the torture as an effective technique.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />What I saw from this movie is that once they stopped torturing the suspect, THAT's when he started giving some of the vital information. Believe me, the \\"good guys\\" in this movie learn absolutely NOTHING of ANY significance from torture.<br /><br />So please, don't believe the manufactured controversy from critics. This is a good film!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Installment five of the series picks up the timeline where books 3 and 4 left it.  Much of the focus in A Dance With Dragons is on the traffic moving toward the action in Slavers Bay.  Unfortunately, as I read through this tome it became apparent that the author had lost the sense of who the characters were in previous installments, and sought to recreate them, albeit with less inspiration.<br /><br />As is to be expected of a book with this title, a fair amount of focus is put on Daenerys and her dragons, but the best that can be said of them is that they lacked the fire and strength they had in prior books.  Dany spends more time wringing her hands (metaphorically) and struggling with each decision than she does doing anything worth reading about.<br /><br />Similarly, other characters with well established personalities seemd to suddenly become much weaker characters with little to compel them through their travails.  Whereas once they were strong and decisive, in this book they seem to have suddenly become mere shadows of their former selves.  Virtually none of the characters remained true to themselves.<br /><br />A few of the plot lines remained interesting and compelling, but sadly these were given short shrift, and made very little progress in this book, likely because they had aught to do with dragons.<br /><br />Fans of the series will, of course, need to read this book.  But if the choice existed, I would instead recommend they read the Cliffs Notes version and save their time.  It is to be hoped that book six can recover the energy of the first four and pursue the roads less traveled in book five.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I got this book after seeing a preview for the movie and now I can't wait to see it. I also can not wait to read the rest of the series and other books by this author.
1576875776|5.0|We heard about this book/photographer from NPR, and had to buy it.  Very glad we did!  The photographs are just really amazing, especially if you know anything about NY.  Even if you don't (as I don't; my husband does) you can appreciate the time period that the photographs capture so beautifully.  Gorgeous!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched it twice my kids loved it. I like movies that show you the follies that could be our world in the future.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Let's start off by saying how much I love the cover!<br /><br />Drew Evans. Oh...he is funny, straight to the point, successful and just the typical \\"manwhore\\"-and I loved getting inside his head! Tangled is written from Drew's POV and an entertaining POV it is! He made me laugh and think-\\"Seriously, guys think that way!\\" :)<br /><br />The beginning of the book is fantastic-he's sick with the flu, can't get out of bed, can't do anything; but Drew isn't suffering from the flu, this Player is heartbroken and (gasp...) fell in love! But the problem...she's engaged and ready to marry another man. And from there, he tells us his story how it all happened!<br /><br />Kate is such a refreshing character. She is strong, witty, held her own and not the helpless, virginal character we always read about. Kate and Drew's banter is hilarious, especially when they try to deny their feelings for each other. Plus, there's a whole lot of sexual tension between two-it's a love/hate relationship. As always, I'm not going to spoil it, so you must read this fab book to find out if Drew is able to get \\"over his flu.\\"<br /><br />Tangled is a light, highly entertaining read and Drew will have you laughing out loud!<br /><br />Oh...and the \\"Bad Word Jar\\" between Drew and his niece-priceless!<br /><br />Need more reviews, check out my book blog: An Asian and White Chick Walk into a Book Blog.<br />asainandwhitegirlbookblog.wordpress.com<br /><br />PLUS there's an alternate POV (Kate's!), called \\"The B strikes Back\\": you can find it here: [...]
0345529057|5.0|Wonderful books, so well written, a pleasure to read! I'm enjoying these books so much that I'm actually taking my time to read every word in them. One of my all time favorites! Highly recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a new look at the aftermath of earth 's destruction. Fast forward a few hundred years to a community of survivors and the rules that keep them functioning. Very well written. I love that the main character is a strong woman and how the author  gets you into the minds and behaviours of the other characters. I truly had a sense of being right there with them. Looking forward to reading more from this author! It's also a great book to do Audio (immersion reading)
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great Game to get lost in. I was disappointed that it was extremely short with no indication of future levels to be added.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is completely awesome. I had it on my iPod and I am glad it is now on my kindle. #1 game. Now only if kindle had candy crush saga!
B005GSY23M|1.0|bought this for one track, which I should probably have just downloaded or ripped from youtube like everyone else. rest of album is pointless
B008K6HN8I|5.0|With so many to applications to choose from I definitely would this recommend product.  I found it easy to use especially coming from a not so good computer person.  If i can figure it our anyone can. I could transfer picture from one folder to the next with ease.  I love it and I now have another place to store my pictures.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I had to go out and stock up on Jeffrey Archer novels after reading the first of &#34;the chronicles&#34;. The stories seem very real to me and I love the historical references.
0061452068|5.0|It's hard to explain exactly why this book is fantastic, it's well researched and gives a long over-view of human progress and history. Yet there's more, I think part of what works is the message, that while there are and always will be problems, our species is improving at these things. The causal force according to Ridley is human trade and interaction, that as we share goods and ideas our society improves, the more trade and communication is open the better things will be.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|I looked upon last book of this series with excitement.  I must admit that I had some expectations of what I thought might be covered in the book.  It seems to me that after a sometimes drawn out story (although enjoyable), the last book both moved too quickly and yet also felt like it would never end.  All this book ended up being was one long drawn out battle.  There was nothing else in the book.  If I had to write a review of the book it would be this.  ** There is a battle and almost everyone dies.  The end. **  I was greatly disappointed that there was not more information about the actual characters in the book.  It seems the author took the easy way out.  'If I kill everyone, I don't have to talk about them at the end.'  I'm really glad I paid for this on the Kindle.  I'd have been upset to pay the full print price for this piece of work.  This has to be the most disappointing end to a series that I've ever read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|glad it is finally on amazon I had it on here from a website but this app has a clearer logo thigh I recommend you try it out besides its free if you don't like it atleast you didn't waste money

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I have seen it in the theaters three times now, each viewing I like it more and more, though the emotional moments in the film are also diluted with each viewing. Those emotional parts are what brings this movie up to deserving five stars. There was little I had a problem with aside from the pointless underwear scene from Alice Eve, and maybe Spock's ridiculous yell. I admit that the plot was a little confusing, though watching it multiple times clears that up. As far as paying fan service, I loved the way that they reversed the roles and mimicked TWOK! While a lot of people found it to be a cheap rip-off, I thought it was done really well and played off mostly of Spock's story arc for a strong emotional scene. There are a lot of people who say there are plot holes, particularly with the science, such as, why is the enterprise under water and not in orbit? Remember this is a science fiction movie, so you can makeup details to explain all of it away. Roberto Orci did when a fan asked and he said that there were asteroids in orbit so the ship couldn't stay up there and had to be underwater to get the best readings of the volcano because of magnetic interference. See? Not a big deal! The movie was very entertaining and Benedict Cumberbatch does an AMAZING job! I know his character scared me! I think this film is much better than Star Trek 2009.

B00C061I3K|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Daft Punk and could not wait til this album came out (still waiting on the first time to be able to see them live if ever). Hearing Get Lucky i knew they were heading in the direction i think they wanted to go the whole time. This album is NOT electronic. If your looking for an Around the World remake you will be disappointed. This album is very groovy and melodic and chill and mellow and just awesome to listen to when your having a rough day. Normally i dont listen to this kind of music but Daft Punk just makes it seem to work so amazingly. If this is your first Daft Punk album stay away until you get a good dose of their older jams then come back so you can fully appreciate this one. Cannot stop listening and its great to have them back injecting life into the music world.

Now I can say that I'm writing with more confidence. The more that I read the book, the more fluent that I can feel my writing becoming. It was affordable, and is very helpful. :)

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Personally this is one of my favorite games ever on my kindle and ipod touch.<br />I've had DragonVale on my iPod fir a little over a year and just recently downloaded on my kindle<br />I think backflip studios came up with one awesome game<br />I think the game would be even better if there was a way to trade dragons with friends because some people are luckier then others<br />Another thing to possibly add could be a second gemstone island for new dragons like the jade-which isn't a gemstone dragon<br /><br />Great job with this entire game, tell those wizards to keep up the good work

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The series and it's brutality should not be read by younger generations. I am 19 and will be having nightmares and feeling pain for the characters that aren't even real.  On the contrary the series is brilliantly written and kudos to Susanne Collins, I didn't want it to be over. Overall I enjoyed the series but would rate it more for a mature audience. I was always team Gale...

B00000633U|5.0|Richard Marx best known by the songwriter for N Sync's THIS I PROMISE YOU, has been producing great albums since his debut in 1987. Among them his second album released in 1989 is by far my best Richard Marx work. Although the album produced a number of great ballad hits such as RIGHT HERE WAITING, CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT, and ANGELIA, I like the album more by rock tracks such as SATISFIED, WAIT FOR THE SUNSHINE, TOO LATE TO SAY GOODBYE and NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. Particularly the second half of the album has a number of great non-hit tracks such as IF YOU DON'T WANT MY LOVE and HEART ON THE LINE. In a  nutschell, the whole album is excellent and if I recommend one album other than his greatest hits this is one.<br /><br />Verdict: Represents rock side of Richard Marx<br />Rating: 98 out of 100<br />Recommended for: late 80s pop rock fans who love STARSHIP, BRYAN ADAMS, SURVIVOR, LOVERBOY and HEART.

B008JFUOWM|4.0|***1/2:<br /><br />  Director Justin Lin got this series back on the right track with Fast Five and his Fast & Furious 6 is actually even better. He saved the series by having it be more than just about fast cars, hot women and street races. The Italian Job style plots are actually working pretty well for this series and breathed new life into it. 6 movies may seem unnecessary but at least part 5 and 6 aren't boring and are actually much better than the earlier sequels of the series.<br />  Surprisingly the strongest thing about this one though isn't the action but the chemistry between Vin Diesel and Michellle Rodriguez. They share some heart felt scenes where he tries to remind her who she is and where she came from. Since she lost her memory and is in with a bad crew now. Still, maybe Justin Lin should stop and just let this series end on a good a note and breath some new life into a series that needs it like....Die Hard!
B00BESIKWM|1.0|For some it came from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, for others it was delivered at St. John's Church. Decelerations of \\" I have a dream\\" and \\"give me liberty or give me death.\\" Moments so powerful, so moving that they change the course of history, they set into motion the wheels of progress that once rolling can never be stopped. For me this moment came as a screen faded to black, a piano playing daring me to reflect, challenging me to look inward and ask, \\"how?\\"<br /><br />How did this movie get made? What sadist wrote it? What studio could have possibly produced it?<br /><br />Sure, it would be easy to blame writer and director Michael J. Bassett, but the scope of agony released by this movie demands we do more. For example we could find fault in the West Midlands forests he used to explore as a child. Why did they not swallow him whole at an age when he was so young and vulnerable? Why did the trees not fall on top of him while he rested by a babbling stream, crushing him long before he had the chance to do the same to dialog and character development.<br /><br />In looking for a scapegoat we could cast our ire at producer Samuel Hadida for funding a movie in which men born and raised in a hellish world carelessly walk into a room full of monsters who they actively ignore before - and in some cases during - the acts of being ripped apart by those same monsters. We could choose to attack studio Davis Films for allowing the making of a film that explained the ability of ancillary characters to enter another dimension by saying: they took a \\"wrong turn in some fog\\". We could even say that the ineptitude of actor Kit Harington was surpassed only by the irrelevance of his cohort Malcolm McDowell. But this would be like saying the Bubonic plague was worse than the Spanish Flu.<br /><br />Is there an answer? Should we just give up, like the movie did when it turned the final confrontation between the heroine and antagonist into a hug-off? No! We can march on, defying all odds and spitting in the face of certain failure, as the movie did by inexplicably making a profit of 32 million dollars. The truth is we have to go deeper and look in the mirror, as Sean Bean does for 15 minutes while his dead wife regales us with a summary of the first movie. Not one person can be held responsible for the tragedy of this film. The sheer berth of this nightmare demands that we look at it from a larger scale and the only entity big enough to support the size of this horror is humanity itself. To this end we find the real culprit, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Yes the USSR.<br /><br />During a thirteen-day span between October 14 - 28, 1962, Soviet ships carrying nuclear arms to Cuba steamed towards a US blockage. Kennedy and Khrushchev promised mutual assured destruction, Humanity stared into the face of all out nuclear war and Silent Hill: Revelations stood on the brink of extinction. Then Soviet Russia flinched a nuclear holocaust was avoided and the world was doomed to witness the creation of this movie.

B001F6TXME|4.0|For long exposures I used to use a mechanical remote that screwed into the shutter release button.  Few if any DSLRs still have a treaded shutter release, which I think is a simpler low-tech solution.  However in the absence of that this does the same thing.  It would have been nice if there were versions longer than 1 meter.  Five meters could have been handy for some bugs and birds.

B007EECSFA|2.0|The prose resembled the tone of the book's cover; rather fluffy, rococo and tinkly. The story had a somber underpinning and the twists in plot were of more than passing interest, but the execution of the telling did not result in a good fit between the two. The frequent reference to a woman's bloom being off the rose grew tedious indeed.

B009AMAGXK|1.0|Bowling for Movies Score: 31.5 of 300 - Ouch!<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average guy on the sofa, came up with to rate and score movies.  Using the latest technology (including a common household food processor and an expensive top of the line Italian espresso maker) and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  This review had originally been done prior to the institution of Bowling for Movies.  We re-did the review after a second watching just to provide the readers of the Bowling for Movies reviews a score, and well, you see it above.  If you bowl a 31, you basically walk in and get a beer and some nachos and watch the other people bowl.  Maybe one gutterball in there...<br /><br />Beautiful Creatures Blu Ray + DVD + Ultra Violet Combo<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br /><br />Ethan Wate is stuck in a small southern town.  He is pretty darn miserable and ready to get out as soon as he can.  He has lost his mother and his father is grieving so terribly that he is totally absent.  Then everything changes.  Lena Duchannes arrives and is the catalyst of his whole world changing.  It is a supernatural teen romance story that is not unlike Twilight, but written from the male point of view.  Lena is a caster and on her 16th birthday, which is quickly approaching, she will be claimed as either bad or good.  Ethan and Lena have to try and find a way to make sure she is claimed as good, and drama ensues.<br /><br />This movie is a typical teen lit novel translated to the screen.  The supernatural is woven into the standard horror that is high school, with stereotypical cheerleaders, and dumb jocks.  Lena turns the town on its head, and brings out into the open the actual family that founded the town - the Ravenwoods are bad-ass and the town would much prefer to ignore that dirty secret.<br /><br />What I loved:<br /><br />This movie visually captured the south.  I felt the mosquitos biting me.  It was sweltering.  It was gorgeous.  Loved it.<br /><br />Emma Thompson, Zoey Deutch and Tiffany Boone are personifications of southern women.  Trust me.  I live there.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum should possibly insure her legs, maybe her smile.  I dunno.  Maybe her whole body.<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br /><br />The accents.  Really, they were tragic.<br /><br />The movie feels fragmented.  I got bored mid-film.  The lack of character development.<br /><br />Emma Thompson (no spoilers here) as another character entirely.  It felt like performance art.  It did not feel right.  Overacted at best.  Worthy of Days of Our Lives.<br /><br />The main character of Ethan was just awful.  Complete doofus.  He looked somewhere between stoned and dumb as a rock.  Ethan is portrayed as being well-read, a kid who reads high caliber novels and wants to escape the small town where he grew up.  But still, ignorance abounds.  One more guffaw and I kind of expected Gomer Pyle to pop out and say \\"Golleee\\".<br /><br />On the special features in the Blu Ray, the director tells us how he felt like certain things in the novels did not translate well to the screen.  While some of the movie contains parts of the book, somewhere in the middle, it just changed completely.  There were losses of entire characters, and the story was completely changed.  Apparently the book's writers enjoyed it, but I did not.<br /><br />*Please note that I did not review the movie as a comparison to the book.  They are different creatures entirely, one not so beautiful.  I actually re-watched the movie to do this review and removed the incredible bias I was feeling the first time I watched it.*<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have the original version for the Nintendo DS, and it has always been one of my favorites. Same game, but new levels. It's like buying an expansion on a different player for it. Well worth 99 cents.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I've been playing Minecraft for about three months now and I am a huge fan! This set captures Minecraft completely and allows you to mix and match the four models. It comes with two micro mobs. In case you don't know, mobs are everything that moves in Minecraft. Even the player. Steve is great, he is the face of Minecraft. It also comes with an extra steve head so you can make another player. The creeper is my favorite mob of Minecraft. he is very simple to make and fits in with the set nicely. There is budder (gold), diamond, lava, and water in the four underground caves. The dirt house is a nice touch and gives Steve a place to be safe from the monsters of the night. The mountain has lava coming out of the side and is big enough for Steve to climb it and get some exercise. The tree with a small stream is a great touch, and Steve can get water without having to mine underground for some. The last model is a tree with a patch of sand. It's basically Steve's sandbox. I like this set because if you don't like something about it then you can take it apart and rebuild it. You get A TON of extra pieces so you can practically do whatever you want. I love it! Minecraft and Lego is a great combination. They're exactly the same. I'd love it if Lego made a series of these Minecraft micro worlds. Overall this is a great lego set and I would recommend this to any Minecraft and Lego fan. Tip: I know this is very popular and has been out of stock for a while. But, Lego is currently selling this on their site for the list price of 34.99. Buy it on Lego and save $20 or more. I bought mine there.

0812982622|4.0|This &#34;account&#34; of life in North Korea was fascinating. The author was gifted in keeping the reader in the dark, pulling me in. I could never &#34;guess&#34; what was ahead. I didn't appreciate the language, of course, but realized that it was authentic. I'm glad I read it.
B009RX85N0|4.0|As Season 2 of Once Upon a Time begins, we find out some of the fallout of Gold/Rumplestiltskin/The Beast's spell.  Among the winners are the Charming family, who have a heartfelt reunion finally aware of their identities, and of course Gold himself, who is now able to start searching for his son Baelfire in earnest.  Among the losers are Ruby/Red Riding Hood/The Big Bad Wolf, who freaks out upon the realization that the spell means she may be subject to her Were side again, and poor August/Pinocchio - who is still in the wooden state that he was in at the end of Season 1.<br /><br />Once everyone orients themselves, the plot that drives the first half of the season begins as two of the main characters find themselves separated from the others and whisked back to Once Upon a Time land - where it turns out a pocket of resistance led by Mulan and Aurora (a/k/a Sleeping Beauty) have been passed over by the curse only to have to deal with Regina/The Evil Queen's even badder mother Cora and the infamous Captain Hook, who has history and a bone to pick with Gold.<br /><br />The second half of the season deals largely with the attempts at redemption of several characters aside from Emma having to work doubletime to make up for the white lie she told Henry that blew up in her face - most notably Gold, Regina and August.  Of the three, August is clearly the poster boy for redemption and the character most worthy of a second chance.  Although it's revealed he's done a few crummy things out of sheer panic and desperation, he wants the best for everyone and earns sympathy points for having been thrown into a situation that no one could have expected him to carry on his small (at the time) shoulders, and unlike the other two he fell short of having blood on his hands.  Regina wants to be the person that Henry believes her to be - or at least wants Henry to think she's the person he wants her to be, and there's a huge difference between the two - but keeps getting sucked back inby Mommie Dearest's influence and isolated by the understandable mistrust of the other residents of Storybrooke.  Finally there's Gold, who's the trickiest case because it's so hard to tell where he ends and The Dark One/The Beast begins.  The obvious question is whether or not The Dark One has held sway so long that Belle can't bring him back.<br /><br />As with Season One, there are identity reveals, some of which work and some of which don't.  We get Dr. Whale's identity this season in a Very Special Halloween Episode that was a bit groanworthy, as it doesn't really fit in with the fairytale/kid's lit format.  On the other hand, we also find out the identity of Henry's father - and the scene where Emma is forced to tell him the truth is extremely well played and wrenching.  Gold also turns out to have two very opposing, game-changing connections to Henry that will undoubtedly affect Season 3.  There were also some issues which came up that were out of the writer's control, with Colin O'Donaghue (Hook) unexpectedly sidelined for a while by an accident and several supporting cast members scaling back time because they'd gotten roles in other series.  In particular, Eion Bailey's casting in a cable series probably forced them to wrap up August's storyline earlier and in a different manner than they might have otherwise.<br /><br />Although it doesn't have the magical sense of initial discovery that Season 1 did, and in spite of the aforementioned unavoidable problems, Season 2 is still quite solid for anyone who's enjoyed it so far.

B003O86FMW|3.0|With almost 10,000 reviews up on Amazon for Catching Fire as of this writing, I don't think I need to summarize what this book is about more than the title of my review alludes to. I will say that Suzanne Collins is a very good story teller in the first person of Katniss Everdeen. However, that is the problem for me with this book. For literally the first half of the novel it reads more like The Diary of Katniss versus the action filled story that I expected the entire book to be.<br /><br />Once finally back in the arena, many of the dramatic (and explicit) details get left out in favor of only what can be seen through the eyes of where Katniss happens to be...in an environment with much going on that is far to vast for her to witness. So an abandoning of the first person writing style--or at least a split between the first person and the all seeing author--may have greatly enhanced Catching Fire. I had already purchased the third in the series ([[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay]]), and with a quick glance at page 1, I can see that the first person will continue, so I hope that The Diary of Katniss does not take over again.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I thought [[ASIN:B008Y7N7JW the movie adaptation of book one]] was terrific. It was awesome to be able to have faces with all of the characters while reading Catching Fire. I remember when the movie came out there was a lot of crying about how it was not as good as the book. Really? The movie was excellent! If every detail and characterization from the book was transferred to the screen we'd have ended up with a 10 hour movie instead of just over a 2 hour movie. And I'll tell you what: I sure hope that the movie adaptation of Catching Fire makes the story even better by devoting more time to detail of the second half of the book versus the absurdly long, deep character development of Katniss. Sometimes liberties need to be taken for a film adaptation in order to keep the action moving, and the action will be non-existent for over an hour if the movie follows the book too closely.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a good, easy read. It's an excellent story. But greatness is lost in page after page of what's going on in the head of Katniss Everdeen versus what's going on around her.nt for over an hour if the movie follows the book too closely.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a good, easy read.

B00A9ET4MC|3.0|I have been a fan of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie for a long time, and awaited the release of this book with a lot of excitement. I am, however, disappointed after reading it. Her talent for weaving beautiful stories was somehow lost in this book. I found the obsession with race and black women's hair strange, and was irritated that most of the book felt like a flashback. If you want something similar to Purple Hibiscus and Half of a Yellow Sun, don't read this. If you'd like a sometimes humorous read about race and how we identify with it, this is for you.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved how it was in Drew's point of view. It was refreshing and new. I loved the way he described things or situations. It was hilarious but I could so relate bc some of those things I hear out of my husband. I just loved it and I can't wait to see the next book!!
B00BT1XCOU|4.0|*** Review Will Contain Spoilers ***<br /><br />There were some major bumps in the road, but How I Met Your Mother finally got there. After eight seasons, they finally lived up to their title. Well, technically, Ted hasn't met her yet, but we can finally put a face to this highly anticipated character. We can finally picture the couple that gave this show its premise. Of course, there's a lot to be said about the closing moments of Season 8, but I'll save that for last.<br /><br />This was a difficult season to grade, because the peaks and valleys were so steep that you didn't know whether the writers had completely lost their minds or were completely genius. Let me put it this way: I look at Season 8 as two halves separated by the hour long mid-season finale. The first half was clumsy, ridiculous and unfunny. The second half was clever, creative, vintage How I Met Your Mother. In December I was writing my eulogy for the show I love so much. And then something strange happened... it got good again. Really good. And I'm fully aware that this isn't a unanimous opinion; I've read the comments, I've heard the criticism. But as a long-time fan of this show, I thought the last 14 episodes of Season 8 were excellent television.<br /><br />Standout episodes:<br /><br />- \\"Splitsville\\" (ep. 8.06)- Robin and Nick's breakup certainly lacks originality, but Nick is just so hilariously dumb that it makes for a charming episode.<br />- \\"The Final Page, Pt. 1\\" (ep. 8.11)- As a fan of the show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', I was pleased to see Alyson Hannigan reunite with her old flame, Seth Green. The jinx storyline was genius; Neil Patrick Harris played it beautifully and it was hilarious.<br />- \\"The Final Page, Pt. 2\\" (ep. 8.12)- This was dramedy at its absolute finest. As touching as Barney's proposal was (and I won't get into details on that), I thought the most moving moment of this episode was the final shot of Ted gazing out over the city, clearly unhappy in spite of all he'd accomplished. If a single shot could be considered \\"powerful\\" in a comedy, that was it.<br />- \\"P.S. I Love You\\" (ep. 8.15)- Robin Sparkles goes the way of many of today's young ex-Disney stars. And boy, is it good! [Dave Coulier's appearance was a hilariously welcome surprise]<br />- \\"Bad Crazy\\" (ep. 8.16)- The Robin and Lily story is vintage HIMYM. I love when the same string of events is revisited time and time again in an episode to account for revelations that change what actually happened. The same goes for \\"The Ashtray\\" (ep. 8.17), which was one of my favorite episodes of the season and reintroduced one of the show's best recurring characters, the beloved Captain.<br />- \\"The Time Travelers\\" (ep. 8.20)- Very interesting episode and easily one of the best of the series, in my opinion. One of the things I love about How I Met Your Mother is its tireless attention to continuity, and this episode is a great example of the writers maintaining a believable timeline. 'Robots versus Wrestlers' could have easily been a silly, forgotten anecdote in the grand scheme, but it was brought back as a reminder to us that the group would go together every year. And who thought we'd ever see Coat Check Girl again? Very pleasant surprise, if you ask me. Then you had Josh Radnor's speech in the closing minutes, which was beautiful and heartfelt. Honestly, it was so good that for a moment I forgot it was scripted. Fantastic episode on every front.<br />- \\"The Bro Mitzvah\\" (ep. 8.22)- If you're a fan of 80's movies, you can't miss this episode. What an homage it paid to one of the great movies of that decade. And it was funny--- classic, HIMYM funny. Easily one of the highlight episodes of the season.<br />- \\"Something New\\" (ep. 8.24)- I know it didn't develop the way many people wanted it to, but I thought by far it was the best finale the show has produced since Season 4. In a way I think it justified the years of teasing this wedding, because it revealed more than just the mother. It revealed what was at stake for each of these characters in the days prior to the wedding. It put every single character's life at a cross roads at that point in time, and I think it was a perfect way to magnify the wedding we've been hearing so much about.<br /><br />What dragged it down?<br />I was thrilled to have Victoria back on the show. Unfortunately, the writers decided to make her a shell of her former self, portraying her as demanding, pushy and illogical. Gone was the charm the character once possessed, and gone was the chemistry she and Ted once shared. Victoria was a major disappointment for me, and she was out the door before she could even make her presence felt. I also thought the ultimatum she gave Ted about Robin was a major cop out by the writers. They messed up big time with Victoria, plain and simple. The character deserved much better.<br /><br />There are very few episodes in this series I would consider altogether bad. In my opinion, \\"The Stamp Tramp\\" (ep. 8.07) and \\"Twelve Horny Women\\" (ep. 8.08) were by far the two worst showings of the series. What makes matters even worse is that they were not meant to be filler episodes; they were important to Marshall's story. The courtroom scene in \\"Twelve Horny Women\\" was the most ridiculous and regrettable thing I have ever experienced in eight seasons of this show. It made a complete mockery of Brad (who I've always liked as a character) and ruined the story of Marshall's path to judgeship. Additionally, Barney's return to the strip club scene in \\"The Stamp Tramp\\" (following his break-up with stripper Quinn) was absurd, unbelievable and not funny in any way. If I had to rank the worst episodes of this show, these two would would top the list. If you asked me where How I Met Your Mother hit rock bottom, I would tell you to look no further.<br /><br />\\"Weekend At Barney's\\" (ep. 8.18) inexplicably backtracked on Barney's supposed burning of 'The Playbook.' The proposal scene in \\"The Final Page, Pt. 2\\" was supposed to be the big turning point for the Barney Stinson character. Instead, the writers cheated us by implying that Barney and Robin's magical moment was not as genuine as it seemed. I've seen enough of the Barnacle's sexual escapades over the years. I wanted to see real personal growth, and rather than allow Barney to take that step, the show faked it. I was very disappointed in the deceitful path the writers took Barney on. I thought the character was really turning the corner.<br /><br />Like I said, the first ten episodes were a complete mess. It was uncharacteristically not funny, unimaginative and for lack of a better word, pathetic.<br />I actually cannot recall an episode in the first half of the season that Lily wasn't crying about something. It could be funny once, maybe twice, and then it just gets stupid. Marshall's role was so lacking at times that he probably could have been reduced to a recurring character. Yes, he was there, but he added nothing at all to the story. While the mid-season finale explained Barney's bizarre behavior throughout the first half, it doesn't make watching it back any more enjoyable. Then there's Robin, who was turned from a strong, independent woman into a neurotic lunatic, playing right into Barney's diabolical plan week after week after week. And the stories? For lack of a better word, at times they just plain sucked. For example, \\"Who Wants To Be A Godparent\\" turned what's supposed to be a humbling honor into a ridiculous competition among a group of friends that forgot how old they were. I could go on, but this review is already going to be too long.<br /><br />Now onto the big talking point, eight long years in the making--- the mother. And I think she's absolutely perfect.<br />I've been reading comments and reviews from fans that think she's not pretty enough, she should have been a brand name actress, she looks too much like Lily. Well, too damn bad. I'm sure we've all had it in our heads what we thought the mother should look like. I envisioned someone that was charming and cute, but not so attractive to the point where she'd be out of Ted's league. After all, Ted is the everyman. He's an average looking guy, has a cheesy sense of humor, has a normal job and has what might be considered a nerd's interests (Star Wars, crossword puzzles, poetry, etc.). This woman is a wonderful, natural fit for Professor Mosby.<br />One of the worst criticisms I've heard goes as follows: \\"I watched eight seasons for this?!\\" I'm sorry, but if you watched eight seasons of this show for the sole purpose of finding out who the mother was, I pity you. It's a sitcom. It's entertainment. It's supposed to be a half hour out of your life every week to shut your brain off and enjoy yourself. Don't act like you had to will yourself through 184 episodes just to be there for the big, dramatic reveal. People don't watch shows they don't like; it doesn't work like that. Sure, it may have taken awhile, but real fans have always had a way of enjoying the ride. So please, stop acting like you just wasted eight years of your life. You could have ended your suffering long ago by simply changing the channel.<br />Cristin Milioti was a brilliant choice, in my opinion. Obviously only time will tell as we gauge the level of likability and charisma she brings to the character, but going into the summer I could not be any happier with the casting.<br /><br />In its entirety, the good outweighs the bad in Season 8. The continuous laugh-out-loud humor has all but come to a screeching halt; however the show still has more than enough clever writing and good execution to be considered a solid primetime comedy. Where the show has really thrived the last couple seasons is in its ascending emotional investment. There's more substance to the show than ever before. It gives fans a chance to really root for the characters as their paths take them to unfamiliar places. To put it simply, we care. And there's a lot to be said for a show that can evoke an emotional response from its viewers (let alone a comedy). How I Met Your Mother is not as good a show as it once was, not by a long shot. But after 8 seasons, it's still well worth watching.<br /><br />Grade: B+Pt. 2\\" was supposed to be the big turning point for the Barney Stinson character.

096798467X|5.0|I eat a pizza at a friends house made in an earth oven made after those gidelines, bread and food come out tasty, this book made it possible.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I wonder where else the author might go in the future with the ideas in this book. Good solid read.
B00511ONPG|4.0|Still reading it. So far so good.<br />I recommend everyone who is interested in the subject. The writer does not just write about the subject but shares his real life experiences with reader.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Can't wait till July when the new season starts. Last two episodes of last season were great, that us why I bought them through amazon.
0671449028|5.0|This is my son's favorite bedtime book.  He really responds to the rhythm and rhyme of the book, as well as the illustrations.  After reading this to him every night, I have it memorized! Great book :)
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is just great. It deffinately recaptures the magic of their Discovery album while not just being a repeat. The songs &#34;Lose Yourself to Dance&#34; &#34;Doin' it Right&#34; and &#34;Get Lucky&#34; will surely stay with you and some of the more experimental tracks like &#34;Touch&#34; and &#34;Contact&#34; will deffinately take you on a journey that will leave a lasting impression if you let them. This album is way better than just about anything else that's released recently in my opinion.
B00CS65JS2|1.0|How are Daft Punk a Relevant Thing that People Pay Attention To? They used to sound like Abercrombie & Fitch music, now they're repackaging disco as something new. This is why all those 13 year old youtubers post about how they only listen to The Beatles because new music sucks--because they're basically right.

0062059963|3.0|**3 Stars**<br /><br />MY OVERVIEW: I didn't enjoy this one as much as The Selection, but it was still good. I like how the author brings in more of what the princess, and eventually queen, would have to do. It isn't an easy job.<br /><br />PROS: Of course I loved learning more about the society and how it came to be. I found it very interesting seeing the beginning of the society from the founder's perspective. Maxon has faults! It is refreshing to see them, and see how he tries to twist his faults to work out for the better.<br /><br />CONS: Aspen, Maxon, Aspen, Maxon... arg make up your mind! America is so fickle with who she likes. It is all about who she is with at the moment and it gets frustrating and annoying. Maxon really likes her and it feels like Aspen is just using her.<br /><br />MY FINAL THOUGHTS: I really look forward to reading the next book. I also just found out that the series will be made into a TV show on CW. I might watch the first one or two just because Anthony Head is going to be in it, but I don't hold out much hope as it is on the CW channel.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So this book got bumped up to the top of my TBR pile because I had to see what everyone was making such a fuss about. This book was getting lots of buzz. So I read it... in one night.  I gotta say Wow! The whole book was told from the guys perspective and I still loved it.<br /><br />This book made me feel a bit like a voyeur. I got to see inside the mind of a womanizer, Drew. He is at the top of his game.  He is young, good looking and super successful at his firm.  He is the best, and he knows it.<br /><br />Katherine Brooks is engaged to her longtime boyfriend. She is new to town and is out for drinks with friends when Drew spots her. The guy who never dips into the same cookie jar twice, finds himself unable to get the ting he wants most. But if anyone is up to a challenge... it's Drew.<br /><br />Katherine is not even a little bit interested in Drew. How could she be? She's engaged.  And Drew is annoying, arrogant, and a total womanizer. She finds herself wanting to smack him upside the head, but that's not what she does. Things end up getting just a li.tt.le weird around the office.<br /><br />This book had me laughing my butt off. I absolutely adored Drew in all his crazy arrogant messed up glory. He refuses to go down and he fights to the very end. The thing that makes this book even better, it was written by a woman.  I found myself rooting for Drew and hoping he got the girl.<br /><br />5 LMAO Stars, read at your own risk (you may wet yourself).
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|I'm not sure where to begin -- the animation is EXCELLENT! This isn't just a \\"bunch of cut scenes from the video game\\" and most/all of the animation is completely ORIGINAL to this movie. FABULOUS STUFF!!!<br />The humor is just great -- very well-written dialogue that kept my kids & I giggling. My wife even bellowed out a huge laugh at a couple scenes, and she's generally not much into \\"comic book-y stuff\\", as she calls it. This is terrific, and worth every penny. Bought one for a friend's son, too. He's gonna love it!<br /><br />As for the negative reviewers, I have only this to say to you: \\"You clearly HAVE NOT seen this movie if that's your view. It is FULL of ORIGINAL scenes, dialogue, and story that DIFFERS from the game while maintaining the same general plot. The animation is PHENOMENAL, and I know you'll come back and tell me how you've seen it, blah-blah-blah, but I have been playing the game with my son, and just finished watching this with my entire family, and can say without a doubt that it is NOT 'just made up of a bunch of cut scenes from the video game'. NEXT!\\"<br /><br />~Charlie~

0545265355|5.0|I love this box set, and the books are fantastic.  The order came quickly, and I was completely satisfied with my experience.  It could not have been a smoother transaction.
B00004WG2F|5.0|We really loved the story this tells.  Loved all the actors - they played their parts very well.  One to watch again and again.
B00DIXEZTI|3.0|True, I've watched it to see what Mads does with it, but it is a revolting series, which doesn't even have the ingenuity and the stellar performance of Anthony Hopkins to justify its existence. Hopkins made us despise Hannibal and watch him with the kind of fascination we'd watch a python, mercifully caged. Mads is a European gentleman who is civil and bland. He doesn't make us shudder, and he doesn't make us disgusted, which is the slim moral achievement of Hopkins. He is just there--supposedly horrifying but actually rather boring. This is not at all the powerful and subtle Mads in his Danish movies. Here he is out of his depth.<br /><br />The plot has nothing to recommend it. It is fragmented and melodramatic. So many victims and so many murderers, or potential murderers, are mentioned that it's hard to keep track of their names and their whereabouts. Each episode starts with a new murder, where the victim is usually perched on a deer's horns. This image can be horrifying the first time, but the repetitions make it annoying. None of the murders are solved, and there is no continuity to the plot line. Will's torments are over-the-top sensational and do not advance the plot. I don't know how much of a plot the book presents before Lecter is imprisoned, but it seems that here the producers are drawing out the story--ad nauseam--for financial profit.<br /><br />What is more depressing is the popularity of the series, which has no human interest or psychological depth. Our culture is shamelessly addicted to stories of bizarre horrors. The fact that Lecter is a psychoanalyst is the ultimate insult to all psychoanalysts who try to help their patients. I get the irony, but it is as thick and sickening as lard.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I loved the books was excited to watch the movie now I wish I had not seen the movie.  Everything important in the book I felt like was left out of the movie Ethan's dad, the dog, the cat, Ethan's aunts, Marian, to name a few. It just felt like the movie wasn't giving the amazing story a chance you can make an amazing movie and get the story right in 2-2 1/2 hours. Plenty of directors have I just wish the movie could be redone.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|I play these types of games often and I find that most have an issue or two that can be frustrating but you can get around it. Not this game!  Every time I attempt to pick up the drumstick it takes me out of game and into my kindle home screen. Unable to finish the game due to this. If it was free I wouldn't care but I paid for this.
B00821OX98|5.0|Good show for a science fiction. I like that they kept God in the story so far. Might be a little low on the special affects so far.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|I bought this based on the number of good reviews and the need to scan a very large backload of my old 35mm B&W negatives and color slides. The first thing I did was insert a 35mm color slide. When the menu came up for film type, it defaulted to \\"negative film strip,\\" and there was nothing I could do -- despite trying everything under the sun -- to change it. In addition, the two film holders that came with the unit were both scratched, minor but clearly enough to affect the images. I ordered an extra set of these, but given the initial -- and terminal problem for me -- I didn't even bother to open them. I returned them as well. At least I got a new SD card out of the order. I am not willing, in this case, to give the manufacturer a second chance. I'll probably go with a professional service, given that I only need to scan the best of my old photos just once. I'll never need to scan after that.
1119963192|5.0|I started swimming about three years ago.  So as someone without the best form, this book has made a huge difference in my efficiency.<br /><br />This book is very useful for all levels, especially people looking to improve their form.  I think the presentation of the materials is excellent.  It is one thing to hear and read about good technic, but this book makes a difference with the great illustrations.  I have changed my form and have a better 'feel' for the water now.<br /><br />One of the local Masters clubs runs a video clinic every quarter.  I plan on participating in the next one and comparing my video footage to the details in the book.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book to swimmers and triathletes.  This definitely gave me my 'ah-ha' moment where swim technic all kind of makes sense now.

B0073TZ1AA|3.0|I tried to use this to read a novel in PDF format, and it wouldn't work reliably. It would stop loading and refuse to refresh. It worked fine with small documents, but don't expect this to turn a novel into an audio book.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|I love music that's able to paint a picture and whisk you away into another world. U2 has always been good at this and The Joshua Tree is a perfect example. The desert imagery is everywhere, from the album title and photos to the lyrics and instrumentation. You can feel the desert wind, see the storm clouds rolling over the sandy plains, and see the dry and dusty landscape from the dunes and towering mountains. The band embraced American roots and blues music and mixed it into their signature sound to create a dense and intimate sound that draws you in right from the beginning. There's nothing like driving through the open country of America while listening to this album. It really gives you the full experience and draws you into another time and another world where you're completely free. It's surreal and well worth the effort if you've never tried it.<br /><br />I can't think of a better opening to an album than \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". It's my favorite song and probably as close to heaven as we can get on this earth. The slow fade-in of the organ as The Edge's shimmering guitar kicks in is so moving and wonderfully done. Bono doesn't even sing until nearly two minutes in and instead lets the rest of the band come in and drive the song as it continues to build. Anyone who's seen the band live can tell you what an amazing and exhilarating experience this song is in concert. It's the climax of every show and everyone waits for the moment when the red lights come up and The Edge's gentle notes kick in. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"With or Without You\\" follow and they make up what could quite possibly be the best three song opening to any album in existence. The former song has always been one of my favorites; some see it as a crisis of faith but I see it as the feeling that we'll never be satisfied in this life. There's always something we're missing or one thing left to do that forces us to keep running. The song isn't about losing faith but rather about understanding that faith doesn't give us everything we want or every answer we crave. It's smart and extremely insightful and one of the first U2 songs I can remember liking and feeling a connection to. \\"With or Without You\\" is the mother of all love-torn songs, a desperate yet beautiful journey through a wide range of tortured emotions. I think it's a great reminder that sometimes simplicity works best, a notion that U2 has always been privy to. They're all amazing musicians but they realize that sometimes a few chords and a simple beat say more than blistering solos and complicated rhythms and this song proves that point beyond a doubt.<br /><br />Those three big hits are known to everyone but the album doesn't stop there. Every other track on the record, while maybe not as well known to causal fans, is something to hear and experience. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" is one of the band's best political songs and it burns with a passion and anger that totally takes you by surprise. \\"Running to Stand Still\\" is one of the hidden gems on the album, a devastating look at the heroin addiction that was sweeping across Dublin in the 1980s. The gentle piano and acoustic guitar sounds are just barely audible over Bono's gentle voice until the end where Bono's harmonica quietly fades out with the song. It's beautiful and has always been a personal favorite of mine, both for it's musical and lyrical finesse.<br /><br />\\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" focuses on the various mining strikes of the 1980s but never actually references a particular incident. Instead it uses these headlines to form a more open-ended story about the trials and difficulties of working in a mine and we hear all of this through the eyes of one of the workers. \\"In God's Country\\" is a more up-tempo track that looks at the promises that America offers, using the Statue of Liberty as an icon with the lines \\"She is liberty/And she comes to rescue me/Hope, faith, her vanity/The greatest gift is gold/Sleep comes like a drug in God's country/Sad eyes and crooked crosses in God's country\\". It's a cautious yet optimistic warning that America offers a wide variety of opportunities, both good and bad.<br /><br />The album continues with \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\". This is easily the most fun and laid-back song on the album. Every member gets a chance to shine and Bono gets to show off some impressive harmonica skills once again. The song stands as a solid reminder of how well U2 truly grasped American music, a concept they would take even further on the their next record, Rattle and Hum. \\"One Tree Hill\\" is about Bono's personal assistant and close friend, Greg Carroll, who died in a motorcycle accident in 1986. It's a touching song and one of the band's best overlooked efforts. \\"Exit\\" is the heaviest and darkest song on the record, beginning quietly until the thundering conclusion where crashing drums erupt in fury. The meaning of this song always seems to change for me: sometimes I think it's about a killer, sometimes about someone driven crazy by a love they can't have and other times they're driven mad by love itself. It's a twisted tale and Bono leaves just enough vagueness in the lyrics that you have to decide for yourself. The gentle closer \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" is both haunting and epic, a tribute to the mothers whose children had disappeared or been taken by Argentinean and Chilean governments, something Bono had heard about firsthand while working in South America as a volunteer. Despite the American themes of the album it's really the time that Bono and his wife spent helping in South America that influences this album and runs through it.<br /><br />The Joshua Tree is beautiful, epic, and absolutely stunning. Every note, every word, every tiny instrumental touch means something and has its own story. Survival and perseverance are two of the biggest themes running throughout the album. Even the Joshua Tree itself is iconic, a lone tree that's able to survive in the harshest of environments. Every U2 album has its own themes and sounds running through it and this album is the one that started it all for me. I feel a spiritual connection to this album, almost like a part of me wouldn't exist if this album didn't and it's hard to imagine I would feel the way I do about life and music if this record, as well as this band, didn't exist. It's hard to put into words but this album just touched me in such a dramatic way that it changed everything for me: musically, spiritually, and mentally. It's my favorite record of all time and an absolute must-own for any serious music fan.

B000IDEORY|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, I have to ask...what planet have you been living on?  This movie is a great movie and I'll never forget the first time I saw this in the 80's and thought it was the coolest.  Still is in my book.  I just love the story, the music, the dancing and the boundaries of love knew no bounds.  What's not to love?  Patrick Swayze was so hot and this anniversary edition is a wonderful way to honor his life and love of acting.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Not as good as her latest novel, but it is certainly worth reading. Her best is Girl Gone.<br />Definitely read that one.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's sort of like an endless running game (i.e. Temple Run) but you fly instead of run, and you swipe and tap to fight robots and enemies, which breaks up the gameplay nicely.<br /><br />You can also use your saved &#34;coins&#34; to buy and upgrade different suits of armor. The amount of suits is impressive, and each has bonuses and their own look.<br /><br />This is a great game, and it's free which is awesome. There's no reason not to download this game. It would be great if some of the other Avengers could be unlocked as secret characters, but that's my only complaint. This game is easily as good as other Gameloft movie tie-in games like Dark Knight Rises and Amazing Spider Man, but while those games cost $7, this one is completely free.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|There's no doubt that Keane was under a lot of pressure after the success of Hopes and Fears and its follow-up Under the Iron Sea. By now the band had established itself as a venerable indie/pop act and had quite a dedicated following, making it even more risky when they significantly changed their sound on their third outing, Perfect Symmetry. The album was met with mixed reviews and a considerable amount of confusion and disappointment from the fan community. Yes, I'll admit that I enjoy their earlier work a bit more but the idea that this effort is some kind of misguided failure is a silly and hasty one at best.<br /><br />I'll readily admit that this was the first Keane album that didn't blow me away on my first listen. Upon spinning it for the first time I remember liking it but it didn't exactly suck me in the way their first two records had. After a few more listens it began to sink in and I warmed up to it as another wonderful addition to the band's catalogue. So what made it less accessible than its predecessors? For one thing, there's definitely an 80's vibe on this one. Those more accustomed to the band's use of piano and more subtle effects were certainly thrown for a loop when this album appeared. The piano is certainly still here but half of these tracks are guided by buzzing synths, whooshing keyboards, and looping beats. The upbeat pop of \\"Better Than This\\" and lead single \\"Spiraling\\" are definitely different from their standard sound and are bound to throw off more than a few listeners at first. \\"Again and Again\\" is a driving number where fuzzy synths carry the melody and bounce along with the chorus. \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything\\" uses them more reservedly along with Tom Chaplin's guitar, an instrument that had been absent on their other two records. It's pretty subtle on these songs but it's certainly there and, to my surprise, sounds pretty good. It adds a bit more instrumental polish to some of these songs and he's a more than capable player. His vocals are stellar as always and he has one of the best voices in music today. He gets better and better with every album.<br /><br />Not every song is radically different. The album's title track is an epic, piano-driven number complete with big choruses and a choir of voices. \\"You Don't See Me\\" is a sombre ballad and classic Keane through and through, as is the closer \\"Love Is the End\\". The bouncy \\"Pretend That You're Alone\\" is also heavy with piano but allows the electronic influences to creep in at the corners, making for a perfect balance between old and new. \\"Black Burning Heart\\" is also more in the vein of their older material, sitting alongside more upbeat numbers like \\"The Lovers Are Losing\\" and the moody \\"Playing Along\\". I can't find any truly weak cuts on this record and each one is fun to unwrap and explore further.<br /><br />Lyrically the album is solid for the most part, though there are moments when the words become a bit cheesy or preachy. This isn't really new for Keane but Chaplin sings them so convincingly that it's easy to overlook. Tim Rice-Oxley and Richard Hughes play as well as ever and that should also be no surprise at this point. They're a tight group.<br /><br />There is one major negative to this record and that's in its production, specifically the mastering. It's horrendous. Yes, the songs themselves sound great but the loudness wars claim another victim with this release. There is NO dynamic range and everything is cranked to 11 in terms of volume and compression. As soon as \\"Spiraling\\" kicks in it's almost painful and you'll be rushing to turn down your stereo, computer, iPod, or whatever you prefer to use for music. It's the one sore spot I have with this record and it's a shame that the band didn't demand another mix to really showcase the new elements of their sound. Their other records had a bit of this but nothing as awful and blatant as the final mix here. It bothered me in 2008 and it still bothers me in 2013.<br /><br />Aside from the sound issues, Perfect Symmetry is a winner in my book. It may lack the fun pop of their debut and the brooding atmosphere of Under the Iron Sea but that's okay. I don't expect the band to repeat themselves and as long as they can make their experiments work then I'm on board. Unfortunately they got too carried away on their next offering, the Night Train EP, and then got back on course with Strangeland, which was my favorite record of 2012. Give this one a chance and take it for what it is. It's a different take on their traditional sound but one that should appeal to most listeners looking for a new challenge and new horizons.ide from the sound issues, Perfect Symmetry is a winner in my book.

B008KP6ENE|4.0|When Boxboy takes damage he sounds like Treetrunks from Adventure Time.<br /><br />This game reminds me of Little Big Planet, at least in the platforming aspect. Don't expect the customization and user content of LPB, but the visual style is there, as the world is make from art-craft materials like that of LBP.<br /><br />Hopefully they'll make a Little Big Planet game for Android one day, or convert the PSP version of LBP like that have PS2 games like GTAIII. Until that day, you can enjoy Paper Monsters. A bit more customization and play modes would increase it's Little Big Planetness, and give it a perfect rating.

B004R6JG7G|2.0|This is a Movie i saw several times back in the day! So when i watched it again recently i was so inspired, by its Bold and Daring plot which i never really appreciated or fully understood as a Kid. The real thing from a Filming standpoint, that set this Movie apart for the time, was the Dog Fight and Aerial Combat scenes which were totally new, in a Movie sense at that time!!! However the Plot has so much more Depth than i remember, and it was so risky a plot for Audiences of the time, when the Movie was first released. The Plot is as follows: Maverick (Tom Cruise) is a Hot Shot Naval Fighter Pilot, who has gone to Top Gun Pilot School to become an Elite Naval Fighter Pilot! (Ooooh Hello Sailor!) With his Co Pilot Goose (Anthony Edwards) who is also his secret Gay Lover. Maverick has to form a Fake Love interest, with Female Civilian Top Gun Instructor Charlie (Kelly McGillis) as to not arouse suspicion of his actual Sexuality! As for Goose he is Married to Wife Carole (Meg Ryan) and Deeply unhappy, sick of having to wait for Secret Back Ally, Hot and Steamy Man on Man Hardcore Action Liaison with Lover Maverick. As if all this is not difficult and challenging enough for Maverick, his main Competition and most Fierce Rival at Top Gun, Pilot Ice Man (Val Kilmer) and Co Pilot Slider (Rick Rossovich) is stirring Feelings in his Special Boy Place! It soon becomes obvious to Maverick that he Longs, in fact yearns to be held in Ice Mans Arms. Ice Man to is in a Gay Relationship with Slider and also has to hide it from the World! Ice Man Longs for Mavericks Touch too, but hides it by being Critical of Maverick and everything he does, Putting him down at every chance. The Raw Lust between Maverick and Ice Man reaches Fever Pitch, in an all Boy Naval Shower scene! By this time in the Movie the Audience is thinking \\"Just F*** already and move on!!!\\" Anyway during a Training Accident Maverick and Goose have to Eject from their F14 Tomcat Fighter Jet and Sadly Goose Dies! Maverick blames himself for the Accident, and struggles with his own Demons Knowing that his Gay Lover Goose is Dead! Yet he cant stop thinking about Ice Man, and the Lust he feels toward him. Anyway Maverick and Ice Man in their F14 Tomcat Fighter Jets, end up in a Real Shoot to Kill Aerial Dog Fight, with some Russian Fighter Pilots in their Mig 28's. Maverick during the Fight flies straight through what is known as a Jet Wash! And looses control of his Jet and just manages to gain control again and survive!!! However it is a Jet Wash that led to the Death of Goose, so Maverick goes into a Panic and Flees the Battle! Leaving Ice Man alone to do Battle with the Russians. Maverick realizes that he lost one Gay Lover and he is not going to go through it again, so rushes back to the Battle to save the Man he now Knows he Loves!!! Ice Man is saved by Maverick and they soon are Back on board of the Aircraft Carrier (Enterprise) where there is a Beautiful scene where Ice Man says to Maverick \\"You can be my Wing Man anytime!\\" Maverick replies \\"Bulls*** you can be Mine!\\" What they are actually saying is \\"I Love you and need you! I need to feel you deep inside me!!!\\" This Movie is very Deep, Risky and Incredibly Homoerotic even now! It makes Broke Back Mountain seem Tame, even Childish!!! This is a Beautiful Love Story and Worth a WATCH! Final note, there is a Volley Ball Grudge match, Maverick & Goose vs Ice Man & Slider, this scene is so Homoerotic!!! And even the Song chosen for this scene is unreal, at a Homoerotic level, really Hilarious!!! I have several Gay Friends and one said \\"I'm Gay hence i Love this Movie!\\" and the other one said \\"Even i think this Movie is too Gay! And i am Gay lol\\" This from my Friends says it all so Beautifully i feel, HA HA HA. Even Men can Truly Love each other, and i don't mean Bro-mance, i mean Hot wet Mouths full of Hot Steaming, Throbbing Man Meat, TOP GUN STYLE!!! Enjoy. lol

I should have known better than to take a chance buying so quickly, this music is nothing like Discovery. If I could refund my money by deleting all the MP3's and shipping back the CD I would. Well, at least I can delete the  MP3's. Thanks for nothing, I'm done with this.

081299471X|5.0|Certain books (SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, SHATTERDAY, GRAVITY'S RAINBOW, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP, THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, etc.) and authors (Nevada Barr, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, Stephen King, John Irving, Ann Tyler, Neil Gaiman, George RR Martin, Jorge Luis Borges) have so impressed me that I've felt compelled to share the book with other readers and/or located everything ever written by said author. CLOUD ATLAS and David Mitchell turned out to be that sort of book, and that sort of a writer (I've purchased all of his other novels as well).<br /><br />I should also begin by admitting that even for an unreserved, omnivorous reader like me, making headway into this novel as was bit tough. But ONLY because the first chapter is written in diary form, and in the 18th century style of English (at times, it reminded me quite a lot of Herman Melville's seafaring novels, so accurate was the mimicry.  And after getting comfortable with that style, it was easy to finish the final chapter (the end of that narrative) when I got to it.<br /><br />Mitchell's Fourth novel, CLOUD ATLAS (perhaps his masterpiece), is - like his first - a collection of the different stories which are all inter-connected.  In this case, Mitchell has used Italo Calvino's IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELER and THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY by Thornton Wilder as, respectively, the foundation and inspiration for his fourth novel.<br /><br />\\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\", the first narrative - set in and around the Pacific Rim, during the mid 1800s - follows the fate of Adam Ewing.  He witnesses a variety of cruelties visited upon darker skinned people, most of whom are enslaved in one way or another, but does nothing to intervene, believing this is the natural order of things.  But his voyage back home - to California, and his young wife -- finds him growing mysteriously ill.  He is seen to by Dr. Henry Goose, another traveler of Ewing's acquaintance. But the good doctor's ministrations don't seem to be helping, and a stowaway - a black islander, who turns out to be a crack sailor, whom Adam kindly helps out - helps save Adam Ewing's life, thus opening his eyes and heart.<br /><br />\\"Letters From Zedelghem\\", the second narrative, set during the early 1900s, in Belgium, follows bon vivant and aspiring musician, Robert Frobisher, who has taken on the job of being an apprentice to a renowned, but mostly retired, classical musician. Frobisher's tale is told in epistolary form: letters from the young bisexual to his long-time lover, Rupert Sixsmith, recount the story of his days with Composer Ayrs, and his sexually frustrated wife. There follows a tale of frustration (Ayrs thinks Frobisher is neophyte with no skills) lust (Ayrs's wife seeks out Frobisher for sexual fulfillment - and her daughter is chasing him as well), wonder (Frobisher begins writing his \\"Cloud Atlas\\" sextet) and longing (Frobisher continues to express his undying love for Sixsmith).  In this narrative of creative wonderment and romantic longing, it is revealed that Frobisher was born with a distinctive birthmark: one that looks like a comet; and he also mentions his frustration at having stumbled across an old journal - written by one Adam Ewing - which is only half there.<br /><br />\\"Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery\\" is the third narrative. It's told in third person, and set in the 1970s in California, featuring Luisa Rey, daughter of a famous investigative journalist of the 1960s, follows the basic tenets of a mystery novel or story - because it is just that.  Luisa (who sports a birthmark shaped like a comet. During the course of writing an article for a tabloid type magazine, Luisa finds herself I the company of a man named Rupert Sixsmith. The older man happens to be scientist in the employ of a company which is committing corporate and ecological crimes. When Sixsmith tries to open up to Luisa, he is targeted for termination - and when Luisa learns the secrets Sixsmith waskeeping, she  finds herself in the sights of the companies hired killers as well.<br /><br />\\"TheGhastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\", the fourth narrative - a boisterous, comedic farce, recounted in first person - takes place in England and centers around vanity publisher and knight errant, Timothy Cavendish. Set during the present - with tongue firmly in cheek - it weaves the hilarious tale of Cavendish's fortunes after one of his customers - an ex-con in London who writes a badly-written tell-all entitled, \\"Knuckle Sandwich\\" - is arrested for murdering a critic who loathed his book.  Cavendish reaps the financial benefits when the book becomes a bestseller. But the brother of his (now favorite) writer come calling, looking for their own \\"piece o' the pie\\"), demanding thousands of dollars, which leads Cavendish - the knight errant - to take it on the lam, resulting in quite a few laugh-out-loud scenes.<br /><br />\\"An Orison of Somni-451\\", the Fifth narrative, recounted as transcripts of an interview, is set around the mid-part of the 21st (or perhaps 22nd) century, in Korea. A fabricant - basically a clone created to live in servitude - is on trial for participating in illegal activities which are considered crimes against the state. Her story - of revelation, escape, and rebellion - eventually becomes the stuff of legend and myth.<br /><br />\\"Sloosha's Crossin' An' Ev'rythin' After\\",  the Sixth narrative, is set in Hawaii after an apocalyptic event.  It is another first person narrative - told in a style of \\"broken English\\" which recalls the old SF classic, RIDDLEY WALKER) - recounting what happens when Zachary - a decidedly non-heroic, but basically good-hearted man - encounters (along with the surviving members of his tribal village) a certain prescient (a human who still has the power of advanced intellect and technology) who is in search of something that will affect the future of all humankind.  But first he and the prescient, named Meronym, must survive a gauntlet that will take them past packs of murderous Kona savages (war-like cannibals).<br /><br />  After the narrative of the sixth section is complete, each of the previous narratives - which all stop at a sort of cliffhanger type ending - begin again, in descending order: narrative 5, then 4, then 3, and so on.  It's a narrative conceit that both keeps the reader in suspense and works to further illustrate how each seemingly separate narrative is joined with the others (in the same manner that seemingly separate lives are either joined together or affected by one another).<br /><br />This narrative technique works resoundingly well, and only adds to the depth, drama and wonder of author David Mitchell's variously moving, and variously entertaining, stories, as well as the over-arching, overall theme: that every human being, no matter how seemingly insignificant, contributes to the future and (in the end) the success or failure of his family, community and species.  And each of the narratives affects the others.  For instance, Adam Ewing's journal is read by Robert Frobisher.  Robert Frobisher's lover, Sixsmith, helps Luisa Rey (and she shares a distinctive birthmark with Sixmith's long-dead lover). At one point, vanity publisher Cavendish is reading the manuscript of a mystery novel entitled, HALF-LIVES: THE FIRST LUISA REY MYSTERY, written by someone named Hilary V. Hush. Fabricant Somni-451 gets to watch part of an old \\"Disney\\" (as future beings refer to films) that recounts the comedic misadventures of an old man named Timothy Cavendish.  And Zachary and all of the surviving far-future humans pray to a goddess named Somni. Thus reiterating the idea that no matter how small, or how big, a being, their life affects the rest of the world in ways one can't imagine.<br />  As Adam Ewing observes: \\"...what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?\\"keeping, she  finds herself in the sights of the companies hired killers as well.<br /><br />\\"TheGhastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\", the fourth narrative - a boisterous, comedic farce, recounted in first person - takes place in England and centers around vanity publisher and knight errant, Timothy Cavendish.

0385344228|5.0|William Landay has written an excellent but dark literary crime novel about the stabbing death of a 14-year-old boy in an affluent suburb of Boston. Ben Rifkin was found stabbed to death in a park where people jogged and students walked to school through the leafy grounds.  Ben was known as a bully at school and one of his victims was the son of the assistant district attorney, Andy Barber.  Andy and his wife Laurie and their teenage son, Jacob, had always lived happy lives together as a family unit, with Laurie overseeing the care of her family with much love and diligence.  Andy was a bit more relaxed about it all, but he loved Jacob and had dreams for his only child.<br /><br />The life of the Barber family is shattered by bits and pieces when what little evidence found at the crime scene points to Jacob as the killer.  Jacob denies that he had anything to do with it, but because of a dark secret that Andy has kept from Laurie that he finally discloses, Laurie begins to doubt her son's honesty.  One of the themes that \\"Defending Jacob\\" tackles is the idea of an inherited tendency for violent behavior such as the \\"murder gene.\\"  Nature and nurture play their separate parts, but is violence and murder in the DNA of Jacob?<br /><br />Andy Barber must take leave of his ADA position while his son's trial before a grand jury is going on and he assigns himself as one of the defense lawyers.  The prosecuting attorney is trying to be the lofty lawyer that he isn't, and is met with more objections than he can count.  Before the end of Jacob's trial, a twist in the story occurs, but the biggest twist of all is at the end of the book.<br /><br />\\"Defending Jacob\\" is narrated by the father, Andy Barber, and transcripts of parts of the trial have his voice, also.  He tells the story looking on as more suspicions about his son and even evidence turn up, and he watches his wife Laurie become a shell of herself as she was before.  Laurie becomes distant, suspicious of Jacob and loses so much weight that she never gains back.  She is also angry that Andy refuses to see the flaws in Jacob that she sees.  Slowly this once loving and close family is broken down over the course of the story and the ending has a shocking twist.<br /><br />The characters in this book are people who could live next door, and who are worthy of the reader's care and concern.  A lot is learned about them and their own families of origin as the book progresses.  Since the author was an assistant district attorney before he starting writing full-time, the legal aspects of the story are compelling and accurate.  Mr. Landay knows what he is writing about.<br /><br />Even when things are going better for the Barber family, there is a dark feeling that hovers just above that doesn't leave when the book is put down.  It is intrinsic throughout the story and makes it seem more like reality.  In an interview with the author at the back of the book, he says he wanted this story to be one of those \\"what if\\" situations, and he met that goal with \\"Defending Jacob.\\"  The interview gives some information and insight into the author's writing, and there is also a list of questions for a study guide.<br /><br />I found this to be quite a page-turner and not ever dull or slow.  The court scenes were especially interesting and informative.  The end will hit you like a brick wall.<br /><br />Highly recommended for readers who like legal thrillers and mysteries and also literary fiction.oses so much weight that she never gains back.

B00BCZU8WM|4.0|This was great because I could listen to it already through the amazon cloud player and as a huge fan of JT I enjoy getting the cd almost like a collector's item. Plus, I can easily play it wherever there is a cd player, such as my car. I drive an older car and it does not have an mp3 jack or a tape cassette player so for the extra dollar really benefited me from spending half and hour trying to burn a cd. The album itself is very different from his mainstream music but its great because you get to hear JT attempt a &#34;Pop/Soul&#34; album; big bands, love songs, long songs, songs that break down, all these things are classic soul and even though this whole album may not be at the top of the charts the album as a whole is very enjoyable. &#34;That Girl&#34;, &#34;Pusher Love Girl&#34;, and &#34;Strawberry Bubblegum&#34; are all great songs not over played on the radio. I hope this is helpful and I would recommend buying this album and even buying the cd itself if you really like JT.

B0040UAYI4|2.0|I bought this cause I wanted to play with my family on PSN. Since I am a sole computer based FPS player the PS3 control just never compared to a mouse. I was super excited when I found this. Setting up is really easy practically plug and play. Went onto the PS3 did its suggested movement config and still didn't like it. I didn't give up though and started messing with sensitivity and anything I could to try to get this awesome idea to work... Its just never going to feel the same. The movements in game are setup diff from console to PC. Glad someone tried to bridge it though.
B0083UWX04|5.0|What is it about a Martha Argerich piano performance? I mean there are plenty of well known excellent pianists to be heard,but there is just something special about Argerich.While some flex their \\"muscles of technique\\",others still hide from their lack of it behind bringing out \\"dynamics\\" to an extreme measure until they literally reach the point of bringing out the insignificant.Martha has stated before that directness should always be the goal in a performance and one should be careful not to sound as if they are \\"immitating themselves\\".I know exactly what she means because she never sounds that way.Whenever I hear her play I am struck by the level of emotional \\"risk\\" being taken.I get the image of one walking the tightrope while juggling.Her level of musicianship(not simply technique or chops)is truly almost unbelievable.In this DVD which is a series of two performances is one of my all time favorite performances of her of the 3rd Prokofiev concerto.Not that there is anything less than excellent of the Tchaikovsky concerto(especially the beautiful Andantino middle part).I simply like the Prokofiev best.There is just nothing less than poetic fire burning throughout the entire piece.It pains me to try to think of words to describe the effect the music has on me.From start to finish Argerich and the London Symphony Orchestra led by Andre Previn truly achieved something special back in May of 1977.At certain times between diffirent parts you can catch Previn and Argerich glancing at eachother as if to acknowledge the fact that they know everyone's on the same page in the genuine effort by all to treat this masterpiece of a composition by Sergei Prokofiev with all the respect it deserves.I can't imagine a stronger effort being put into that task. Bravo! Martha Argerich is a true hero of mine and this DVD is well worth buying.eady know to research the events going on in her native country Argentina around this time.The \\"Dirty War\\" was in full swing and I have a hard time believing Argerich was not aware of it at the time.I believe in a way her piano playing was speaking for those who could not speak.This is all speculation to be sure,but at that point in her career there was an element of suffering and desperation in her playing that was as obvious as daylight for those willing to listen.Martha Argerich is a true hero of mine and this DVD is well worth buying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the most awesome game I have ever played it is just so fun and I love the cariters and the boards you have you put in the game are awesome
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Can't wait to sequel.  I read a great deal and will follow Kirra Cass. Great book.  Awesome follow up to The Selection.
B004ZNACA6|1.0|Open this box set was very painful. Each album I took of from the box was a nightmare. ALL of them had its booklet glued on the cover and this ruined it when I took it up one by one. Some of the covers had air bubbles provocated by the worst and cheap plastic cover package I ever saw. It's hard to believe that Pink Floyd authorized this truly piece of garbage. Save your money. Don't buy this crap.
0345803485|4.0|Very interesting book which gives another insight of life. I bought for some friends to read and share. They liked it.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This film was everything that I hoped it would be and more. I very much enjoyed Ben Affleck's other directing endeavors, and this one did not disappoint. Sure, it was stretching the truth... But when has Hollywood ever made a movie that didn't stretch the truth at some point in a nonfiction film? I thought it was gritty, very real, the suspense was unnerving, and the acting superb. Cinematography, set design -  the feel of the 70s was Fantastic.  I liked it very much and ended up watching it two times back to back... thanks Ben
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|My parents love it! I bought them the CD and DVD and both of them listen to and watch them very often.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was just as good as the first one. The series was not what I was thinking it would be, a romance, its a little more... Racy.
0061122416|5.0|one of my favourite book ever, its a wonderful read an a text i often come back to within my spiritual journey's etc
B000002G7E|5.0|as Velvet Underground fans know the immortal \\"Velvet Underground and Nico\\" album has been given the deluxe treatment deservedly so--and this even more hardcore lp needs to be given the \\"deluxe edition\\"also.while alot of people do not want to shell out big bucks for the box set \\"peel slowly and see\\",alot of bonus tracks(2nd cd)can be added to this.demos like \\"there is no reason\\",\\"sheltered life\\",the instrumental \\"Booker T.\\"and various alternate takes would make this fantastic for us Velvet fans .(and i agree with the one reviewer--you better be a hardcore fan to listen to 17:30 of \\"sister ray\\"--very groundbreaking for early 1968 to say the least!!!).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought the first book of this series was good but this one is even better!!!<br />If you like these types of books...you will love this one.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Beautifully photographed and executed.  Shows the universal nature of babies, no matter what the culture was. I did wonder that there were no men in the segments in Africa whereas there were in the other countries.
1936594234|1.0|Joseph Murphy wrote an outstanding book with this title, but do not make the mistake I did and buy this version of it. Soho Books ruined this outstanding book with terrible formatting. There are no longer chapter breaks and a table of contents. There are typos and so many distracting errors that I finally threw it in the trash and bought another version that was properly formatted.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|No matter what your religion, or that you are agnostic or atheistic, the experience of the writer, while being medically monitored as having zero brain function, is of great significance. It opens up all sorts of possibilities for all of us, and impacts directly on what we regard as our &#34;life purpose&#34;.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Always enjoy Bruce Willis in any movie, but too much writing of Russian<br />language took away the enjoyment of WATCHING the movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Ordered this for my husband for his birthday. He loves it. We are in the middle of the series again, but this is definitely a classic worth owning.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Best movie ever!!! Best writing, acting and direction!<br />Greatest plot!!! Best everything, best filming location, best everything ever! Best movie since the amazing spiderman!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Fantastic collection of all the HP films.  I love escaping with these timeless treasures and can't wait until my kids are old enough to introduce both the book and the films.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|One of the few movies where Arnold is not bullet proof but<br />kicks butt!  It one that I will watch more than once.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|love my desperate housewives for the great writting, witty words, i miss the show its was my fav, so now i can watch them over and over again
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Don't let the title if this movie fool you. This is a movie about people adjusting to circumstances in life when the unexpected happens and how changing can bring sucess, love, growth and joy on multipl it.e levels. Highly recommend
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Picked this up as FAOTD, but I'd been looking at it before.  As many others have noted, the graphics are 8-bit retro style, and it can be really hard to tell what the critters you're fighting actually are (until I noticed the monster name on the dungeon entry screen, I'd thought the Goblin Cannon was a dog that somehow threw something at me).<br /><br />Here's the thing - the graphics don't matter.  You'll be far too busy trying to check whether you're fighting an opponent or trying to unlock a chest, so you know exactly what tiles to pull together (weapons to attack, keys to unlock locks).<br /><br />You can pick what special abilities to develop first, and your access to more powerful abilities is limited more by what you pick up in the dungeon than by your character's \\"level\\"; you can upgrade the \\"stores\\" with building materials you pick up in between your monster fights.  Of course, in practice, you're probably better off buying what you can afford now than not taking an upgrade for hours, since a balanced upgrade path seems most likely to lead you to gold, building materials, and experience more quickly.<br /><br />I completed the game in about 4 hours' worth of play - less than 36 hours after I picked it up.  It always seemed like I had to have time for just one more run through the dungeon - which turned into 5 more runs all too easily.<br /><br />If I had bought it at full price, it would still easily be worth it.  Highly recommended.  Not excuse me, going to check if this company has any more games....
B00B10DZQE|4.0|Enjoyed the actors and have a lot of respect for challenging mother nature.  Surfing the &#34;mavericks&#34;<br />takes a lot of guts and training.  The movie being based on true story made it even more intense<br />to watch.
B003Y74KAW|5.0|love my silicone case. I got the red its a nice color red. Just wanted something simple, these last forever. I still have one for my previous phone its in new condition it never faultered at all but I needed to get a new one to fit my new phone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I'm not sure you can actually love a micro cable, but it is the top rating! It fits much more snuggly then the orginal charger cable  and I hope it will keep this kindle fire charging for a log time.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|OMD is back!<br />This is their best disc in years and is both musically respectful of their past work and finds some new sounds as well. Recommended for all fans of OMD and those who enjoy electronic/synth with a direction
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I was glued this book. I bought the second one right after I finish this one. I am in love!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My wife and I grew up playing Solitaire, and to have it on the Kindle is just great fun. I enjoy sitting and playing in the evening<br />when I just want to relax. And our 4 month old grand daughter loves to watch the cards fly around when we win.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|If you know blokish, this is just that.<br />Only complain would be that I can only play red.<br />I wish I could choose different color when I'm playing by myself.
1423140591|4.0|This book fits right in with Rick Riordan's other enjoyable reads. This book is pretty similar to the first Heroes of Olympus.<br />Plot: 4/5 The usual fast-paced and exciting ride.<br />Characters: 4/5 Likable and fleshed out. Mr. Riordan seems to have improved his ability to create characters by quite a lot.<br />Setting: 4/5 Creative and interesting, I really enjoyed seeing how the myths and magic became part of modern America.<br />Writing Style: 4/5 Casual and peppy. This author would make a great public speaker.<br />Total: 16/20 A fun read that will stay on the shelf for quite a while.
0756404738|5.0|book was great and came to me in great condition. this is one of my favorites for this past months read
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|As always, Paramore excels in their music.  This album took their music in several different directions, but always came back to that definitive Paramore sound.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Steven Speilberg took years to develop the film about Abraham Lincoln.<br />He ended up with a script of mini-series' length then he decided concentrating<br />on the period of the president's efforts in passing the 13th amendment instead.<br />Likewise it took a couple of years of research on the subject by Daniel Day Lewis<br />before accepting the role.<br />The resulting film is short of expectations.<br />The film started with a short combat sequence at night in the rain between the Union and Conferate<br />soldiers.  It was short and inconsequential to start a film of this magnitude.<br />It followed by the out-spoken black Union soldier spoke eloquently to Lincoln about black<br />soliders' plight which seemed unrealistic for that period of time and history.<br />Both sequences could serve better if they occur later in the film.<br />The casting also has some problems.<br />Daniel Day Lewis' portrait of Lincoln could be accurate(based on his habitual exhaustive research) but<br />it fell short of general public's expectations of Lincoln based on the stern and serious images<br />the former president left behind.<br />DDL's Lincoln seems more frail and contemplative than a president of Lincoln's statue.<br />This Lincoln also told too many stories at some pivital moments of political discussions(another<br />sign of weakness, using stories to convey his messages?).<br />There were other casting misfortunes.<br />Tommy Lee Jones, albeit did a good job, his face is too recognizable and modern plus a funny-looking<br />wig.  James Spader's character was almost like a drunkard.  Was it intentional to achieve some light<br />moments?  The large cast of characters with different names was also hard to follow.<br />Only Sally Field gave a strong and heartbreaking performance as a long suffering wife and worried<br />mother(Best Supporting Actress?).<br />Lincoln's efforts and success in passing the 13th amendment was a seminal historical event for the<br />Americans.<br />Relying on that event alone might not be enough for a compelling 2 hr film(except the amendment passing<br />sequence).<br />Abraham Lincoln deserves a better film(Watch John Ford's \\"Young Mr. Lincoln\\" with Henry Fonda).<br />Relying on that event alone might not be enough for a compelling 2 hr film(except the amendment passing<br />sequence).<br />Abraham Lincoln deserves a better film(Watch John Ford's \\"Young Mr. Lincoln\\" with Henry Fonda).
1423113462|4.0|This book is so much better than the original Percy Jackson.<br />Plot: 4/5 Pretty good action-adventure. Very nonstop, though, with pretty much no lulls in the action at all.<br />Setting: 4/5 As always, Mr. Riordan does a great job integrating magic into the modern world.<br />Characters: 4/5 This is what really differentiated this from Percy Jackson and the Olympians. They are way more fleshed our, believable, and just plain more interesting.<br />Writing Style: 4/5 Super casual. This author writes with no regard for proper grammar at all. It's like he's talking to you, which is a bit odd but somehow enjoyable.<br />Total: 16/20 A nice story. Definitely a read-again book.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|book was great and came to me in great condition. this is one of my favorites for this past months read
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I love this CD. I've listened to it for hours. Some of their best songs are on it. I was born in 1986, but (in a good way) it makes me feel I was born in 1956. I listen to my mom's records as a kid and now I am enjoying them in my own way.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|The film started with the harrowing voice recordings of the victums of 911 against a black screen.<br />It sets the motion of American government's efforts in hunting down Bin Laden.<br />The script writer did a painstaking job in woven the multi-stranded stories together throughout<br />the unsuing 10 year period until Bin Laden's capture and execution.<br />All the characters on both ends of the war were finely sketched, cast and acted.<br />The several water board interrogation sequences were brutal and courageous for the filmmakers to<br />reveal albeit some objections against its accuracy and whether it actually happened.<br />The large cast was strongly headed by Jessica Chastian who should have been awarded this year's<br />Best Actress Award (not that Jennifer Lawrence did not give an eye opening performance in \\"Silver<br />Lining Playbook\\").  She gave a multi-layered and full-bodied character study of a determined CIA agent.<br />The film is a flawlessly written, acted, directed and edited film with a complex and important story<br />to tell.<br />The film's 157 min length seemed like a normal 120 min film, engaging, captivating and exciting.<br />In my view, it is the Best Film of this year's nominated Oscar films.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it. I recommend this book to anyone. It sad funny and brings people hope. This was a great book

B004DLPXAO|2.0|I lost this app It deleted it self for some reason ,  It will not download newest version what is the original version ?<br />and can you help me to not have this problem .
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|As a \\"historical drama\\" entertainment, it worked, but with some fatal flaws.<br />The film started with a brief recap of Iranian's recent history in an effective graphic/comic book fashion.<br />It then showed the seige of the US Embassy in Iran at the height of US/Iranian conflicts of the 70's<br />with hostages taken and a small group escaped.<br />This is the film about the rescue and escape of that small group with the aid of an American CIA agent<br />and crucial assistance from the Canadian government and diplomats.<br />It is an entertaining ride with straightforward narrative and engaging acting by the large cast headlined<br />by the subdued Ben Affleck, a new creation from the real Tony Mendez.<br />The major flaw that stretched credibility is the missing copies of the required immigration slips for each passenger.<br />Only one was checked and let go even without the slip.  How about the rest?  The film just let it slide.<br />The cardboard nasty portrails of the Iranian border guards and the chasing after the plane were so old-schooled<br />that that diluted the credibility and quality of the film.<br />It could that this is an easier film to follow than \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" to be awarded the Oscar Best Film by the<br />Academy members.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I'll get right to the point.  I really liked this book, I loved the dialogue and enjoyed the time taken to tell the story. But what happened to the end? All that time taken to paint a lovely intricate picture just to ruin it with a quick sloppy brush stroke of a ridiculous ending.  Did the author get bored, tired of her own story, maybe had somewhere important to go? Whatever the case may be she sure didn't waste any effort on the ending. What a disappointment.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The new look is boring and hides essential information and navigation is counterintuitive.  Skip this app until they fix it.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Except for the Tron: Legacy soundtrack, I've never been impressed by Daft Punk. I'm not a fan of techno or disco and have never had a desire to get into the genres. I probably wouldn't even have previewed this Cd if it hadn't popped up on Spotify every two seconds.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind, I was pleasantly surprised by Random Access Memories. Not only is it a significant departure from Daft Punk's normal fare, it's a departure from the techno genre altogether. The biggest change is the shift towards classic funk. While their signature electronic sounds are still present, the majority of the instruments sound real and not synthesized. The guitar in particular is bright and funky and straight out of the 70's. I also enjoyed the pure vocals and wished their were more instead of Punk's normally heavily synthesized tones. Standout tracks include Give Life Back to Music, Lose Yourself to Dance and Touch.<br /><br />While Random Access Memories is surely fresh and entertaining, Daft Punk may have spread themselves too thin trying to appeal to the techno and funk aspects of dance. The album may not satisfy pure fans of either genre. Still, it is a welcome addition to Daft Punk's growing discography as well as to the music industry itself.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I have read this book a few times.  Each time I learn something new that helps me in my financial life
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|It opens and takes me to the home screen but whenever i press play it just reloads and takes me back...  This happens no matter what I choose..
B0064MGU98|5.0|I really like this show because its not like Law and Order SVU but not that graphic. Great show and I have so many more seasons to catch up on
B0013FSXT6|5.0|I'm not entirely sure what exactly the point of this movie was. Certainly Kubrick had a unique vision here for it and it certain was good, but I'm confused as to what it's was trying to cover. Perhaps I'll need to watch it again.
B007C52NY2|5.0|Now have read and enjoyed each and every one of them.  Great set of Books.  Would recommend this set of books to all readers.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|With teary eyed moments, and happy joyful moments, this book is an amazing read!  I suggest this to anyone who is in the mood for a good read!  Definately my new favorite book!!!
B00C061I3K|3.0|There's some good moments on this album that took eons to make. What with all the dance power talent behind the album, I expected a LOT more extended grooves that you could get into. Enough with the auto-tune for God's sake. Daft Punk had a great opportunity to take dance music higher. I think they missed the chance.
B00AEBB8FQ|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this to be honest. Usually I don't find comedies all tht great and Ben Stiller is certainly not my favorite. But here everything worked. One of the funniest movies i've seen in a a while.
1595826971|5.0|I had high hopes for the quality & contents contained within this fantastic art book, and it didn't disappoint me. Imagine a middle school textbook that has been slimmed down in width by about 60-65%, that should provide with an idea of the volume. It provides great facts about the  style of the game with high quality pictures. I have yet to find a flaw, which I doubt I will find.
0060254920|5.0|Great deal, description & shipping! Love the illustration in this book and the animation in the film. All the best.<br />Nileey
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Like everyone else I found this game to be very addictive. Easily played.  No brainpower needed. Apparently finished the game with the last puzzle.  Read somewhere that something happens at level 300 but also have read things that do not seem to appear on this version. Played on kindle fire.  Have patience.  The more you play the more prizes you collect the more coins you get. But once the last puzzle is complete there seems to be no ending.  More puzzles coming? Anybody know?
B000O76TAE|5.0|Quite possibly Tom Hanks' best film. It's captivating and interesting, wonderfully acted and overall fantastic. The steelbook is a great thing to own.

B001TXWJ4M|3.0|It kept stopping, no matter what I did.  Frustrating and confusing. This has happened with two different internet providers, so I don't think it's my problem.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book because it has Greek and Roman mythology in it and I love both!The author is awesome!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is my favorite game of all. I play with a stylus to reach into the smallest places. I tilt it on a side so I can actually see two sides at the same time. Just use the stylus to move it. I have some favorite cubes and have a tendency to match the stars last. I play almost every day and it is my go to game at the doctor's office. Great game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This games is so fun...love it...The arcade is my favorite then the mineral challenge but the classic is fun as well.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|terrible cussing bad sexual themes and flatout violence in my opinion this is a big waste of a $1 DO MOT BUY OR KIDS OR EVEN YOURSELF
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|As Rod writes in one of his new songs &#34;live the life you love and love the life you live&#34;. This cd is absolutely filled with wonderful music and lots of thoughtful meaningful songs. He is definitely getting play time in my car, home and office!

B000055ZB8|5.0|Great film, I liked the feelings you got from this movie. The silent aspect of this film makes it that much scarier.. Great buy for collectors
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|After seeing this live in concert I had to get this dvd!  Great quality and sound!  Now I relive every moment!
B0024FA9IM|5.0|Watched this movie with my family in a theater.. watched the original show as well.. this is a great blu ray, great story and it's nice to see older characters roles come back to life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app.  could use some game variations,  but a really nice basic solitaire game.  love using my own pics to decorate the cards
B00471TLZS|5.0|The original Poltergeist is a movie I really enjoy watching. It was a huge favorite of mine when it can out and I still hold it in high regard. I like the fact it doesn't rely on blood and gore to make it scary. It relies on good old build-up and tension. Excellent movie that stands the test of time.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I gave this game 2 stars because it is a brilliant game, very addictive and lots of fun. My only complaint is that I, as other reviewers were, was cheated out of $3.99. I downloaded this game for free, decided to purchase \\"Flo's Restaurant Pack\\" for $3.99 to unlock all 12 restaurants and a few days later the levels are locked and I am again being prompted to spend $4 more to unlock them. So needless to say no more PlayFirst apps for me. Very disappointed.<br /><br />**********UPDATE********** After contacting the developer through their website they informed me that Amazon will not allow double purchases so if I click on purchase again it should restore the other levels of the game without charging me again. So I took a leap of faith and it worked. So just ignore what I said up there and enjoy the game. :)
B002WIDRM6|2.0|I was disappointed in this CD.  I own two of their other CD's and was excited for this one.  I ended up donating it.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|My dad introduced me to this group. So glad he did. They are very talented and I am looking forward to hearing more from them.

B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is one of my all time Disney favorites, and true to Disney entertainment form, the whole family can enjoy this movie.  Get out the popcorn and soda and plan on a evening of laughs, tenderness, and even a little tear jerking.  Fantastic movie.
0142412147|5.0|The book came to me in great condition. The book itself was a great piece of work - humor, romance, angst. It had it all, and it was an easy read. Great for the holidays.
B0084IT59C|5.0|a modern day classic. this book we keep in our personal library and certailnly will be read over and over.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|All the characters were younger believable versions from the original Star Trek series.  The characters stayed true to form.  The plot was amazing and when a movie is over with that quickly, you know it got and held your attention in a good way.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|At 15 minutes in I fell asleep for 2 hours, at 47 minutes in started writing this review to warn others, nothing has happened and nothing has been built and I still have 2hrs to go. I don't know what is going on and I no longer care. It must of been a great book and that must be the same people writing the great reviews but this movie sucks. Halle Berry can't act so letting her play multiple rules is not a good idea.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Gotta love being able to see the amazing video right after doing it.<br />Helps check to see if you actually got a good shot.<br />Must have
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|If you hate Tom Cruise you're an idiot because he almost always delivers and does here with a detective movie, you'll like it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it allows you to get so many powerups! Wow I just have no words for that describe it!
B00006AW63|1.0|I just it this movie and it would not even play would really like my money or a different movie and quick shipping
B00280LYIC|5.0|Aaaaawwwwweeeeeessssssssoooooommmmmmmeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />This book is amazing and a good thing for people who like to read percy Jackson fantasy novel books
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I was expecting this show to be good, I wasn't expecting AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC. The acting is brilliant and I love the portrayal of the characters. You can see where each actor has made sure to posture themselves in certain ways, where the director made a decision that worked well. It is dark, gruesome, and I can't wait for the rest of the episodes to see what happens next.
1400082773|1.0|With the benefit of hind sight it's easy to pick out the false hoods in Obama's fabricated narrative.  I've come to believe Bill Ayers probably did author most if not all of this crock.
B00846REIS|3.0|this book is ok - almost to similar to 50 shades but not written as tasteful and 50 shades - I was expecting better
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I didn't really want to watch it, but my husband insisted.  I really enjoyed it.  Look forward to more of these in the future.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|Why 5 stars? Because this T-Rex fills every one of my sons desires.<br /><br />It's green (his favorite color)<br />It's mouth opens and closes (he makes this thing bite everything)<br />It's legs don't articulate (a source of frustration with some of his other dinosaurs)<br />It's detailed (believable)<br /><br />This toy/model makes me WANT to believe a green T-Rex could have been real. It's just so good looking.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|What a wonderful story!  MUST SEE!  Need I say more?  This one is so good - one of the best I've seen in a LONG TIME.
B0073QNIH6|4.0|My son loves it, but this thing looks really weird. Schleich is the only company I've ever known to give the Allosaurus a wide head and a slim jaw like the one on this model and the predecessor to this one. I can't even find pictures of an Allosaurus, whether it's a skeleton/skull or artist's rendering with a shape like this. With it's mouth closed it's lower jaw looks nearly absent like some genetically defective dinosaur. Also, it's articulating jaw is crooked on every Schleich Allosaurus every model I've look at.<br /><br />However, my son doesn't care and plays with it often. It's sturdy enough that he won't break it. It's paint job was done very well.<br />4 Stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so cool I am speech less I can't tell you how much I love this game<br />First of all thank u ho made dis game so WOW ( :
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Cabin Fever is a sumptuous book. I am a big fan of the diary of a wimpy kid:) ps l hope you like the series too!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Brilliant...just brilliant. It has the same emotion, history and intrigue as the The Kite Runner, but a different feel. Great read!
B00009R86L|5.0|I love my Domke camera bag but my only complaint is why this wasn't just included with the bag. This shoulder pad beats any that I've ever used on any bag. It's soft but sturdy due to how thick it is so no matter how much weight you put in your bag you'll still have cushioning. Some may not like that it's contoured to fit on a a specific side (one of the longer sides of the pad is thinner than the other). I actually have no issues with this as I always carrier shoulder bags on the same side. The velcro that holds it on is incredibly strong and the pad doesn't shift on the strap at all. I am actually going to start using this on every messenger/shoulder bag I have as it's that comfortable.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Simple game to match colors, three or more, so addicting especially if you play threw f.b. to try and beat your friends high scores!!  Once you start you can't stop!! Works great on my kindle fire. HAVE FUN
B00001SIES|5.0|My wife turned me on to Muse just recently. I am absolutely hooked now. I started just listening to their popular radio play stuff and then expanded out and tried the rest of the music. Let me me just tell you, there is not a bad Muse cd. I can listed to every single song on every single album they have made. This one is personally my favorite. They have such a unique style, a blend of so many music styles yet they make it work. Amazing musicians. They may be the most underrated band of all time. Don't just buy this cd, buy all of them! You will not be disappointed.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Hard to follow @ the beginning but hang in there! Touching and totally envelopes you into the value of time and preciousness of the present moment!
0989254607|4.0|Ms. Goss is truly a gifted writer. I was kept in suspense throughout the entire book. She kept me guessing about what would happen to Sara and all the people involved with her. The intrigue kept me turning the pages until I had to force myself to not try to finish it in one day. I think spiders are interesting and amazing and having them be a part of a human species rang my chimes. Almost makes me want to go out and capture some Hobo spiders. If there is to be a sequel, I will definitely buy and read it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A slow start with two assassinations but really starts moving when Will Robie refuses orders in his ear to shoot another.  A bullet through a window kills his target anyway.  He runs, picks up a teenager's girl whose parents have been murdered, and discovers that the third shoot was not authorized.  Now assassins are hunting him and the girl he is protecting.  Bullets fly and things really get exciting!  Robbie finds he can't trust anyone because of double agents in both the CIA and the FBI.  The ending appears a little contrived and doesn't have the wallop of the rest of the story, but the book is well worth reading and I found it hard to put down.<br /><br />Richard Ruppel
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I have not done any official testing, but I don't notice any significant difference in battery life for these cheap batteries compared to &#34;not cheap&#34; ones.  I use them in flameless candles, and they last a couple of weeks when the candles are on for 5 hours per day.
1402793375|5.0|True rating: 4.5 stars<br /><br />To start with, yes, this book is not perfect.  Well, if you want all sides of the story, read more than one book.  However, for an introduction to the Plains Indian Wars (and one that helped me get started in a more serious study than I had before thanks to a wonderful bibliography), this is quite good.  Now, lets talk about the new illustrated edition on offer here. It is absolutely beautiful, filled with great photos, some I have never seen before and even has some additional material included by other authors.  Again, 4.5 stars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game for folks that like brain puzzles. Can't wait for the next chapter to come out very addicting game. Makes you lose all track of time.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is an intelligent yet entertaining film that gives a positive or quirky way at handling challenges in life.  Excelsior.<br /><br />We did not expect much from viewing this movie and were surprised that is was well-made and great chemistry among the actors.  Jennifer Lawrence is the best actress and Bradley Cooper should have been the best actor.  Both of these actors are under-rated and have a diverse and compeling way of acting.  Even the chemistry between the the father (played by Robert DeNiro) and his son Pat (Bradley Cooper) was interesting and revealing.<br /><br />Every movie has a purpose or playbook, this movie has a great lesson to find a silver lining on every challenges.<br /><br />Well-done.
